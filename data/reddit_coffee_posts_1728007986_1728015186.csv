1fvqp1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1fvqp1c/isnt_south_indian_filter_coffee_the_best/,Isn't South Indian filter coffee the best?,"So we are in the information age and also YouTube. So when youtube recommended a video about coffee I click on it and went down, deep down the rabbit hole.

Learned from youtubers about the different types of coffee (Arabica / Robusta) then how to select roast how to select grind ( fine, coarse or anything in between) and don't even get me started on the way to brew coffee. With some equipment it looks like for good coffee you need to set up a chemistry lab.

However, after trying out quite a few variety of different coffee from coffee shops (both popular and niche) buying popular coffee from popular brands and even ultra premium brands who when I complained of mediocore experience with the coffee suggested even more expensive machine to help me brew my coffee to perfection. Equipment wise I have purchased a few items to try and then stored it away as it is either too tedious or usless. 

After all this, I still feel the best coffee I LOVE is South Indian filter coffee. Very affordable brewing apparatus, standard coffee powder, easy steps to brew your coffee.

I‚Äôm gonna be living here for roughly about six months before moving back while I‚Äôm staying with family so I can get surgery for a separate medical condition.

I‚Äôve always had migraines and headaches growing up. It was consistent in my life in 2019. I was diagnosed with migraine aphasia after severe attack caused me to go into a coma for 18 hours in 2020. I had another attack that caused me to also have a stroke Since then I‚Äôve been on medication to help with the migraines preventatively and to assist my anxiety and depression that occurred after my first attack.

When I was living in the Pacific Northwest, my migraines occurred maybe once every few months and we‚Äôre not greatly painful. A day or two in bed and I was fine, but since I moved back to Tennessee within a month, I‚Äôve had over four separate attacks that have left me Having nerve numbness in my fingers and arms, pain and my neck and shoulders and throbbing ice pic headaches around all areas of my head. Earlier today, I had another one after drinking a cup of coffee on an empty stomach, which I would always do in Oregon but for some reason, it‚Äôs affecting me 10 times worse now.

I write all of this to ask the community if they have heard of any increasing triggers within the Tennessee area or just along the southern East Coast.

**My friendship blew up on a trip to Japan**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!xenophobia, racism, disparaging eating disorders, ableism, misogyny, victim blaming!<

----------------------------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/vGnMgCG8J2): **September 23, 2024**

Finding out my friend of 5 years was an absolute AH when taking her on her first trip to Japan one year after I moved back from there. What did she do?:

Wouldn‚Äôt add to the itinerary at all but complained every single day when we got there. I took her to popular stations in Tokyo since it was her first time and we had 7 days‚Ä¶but she wanted to go to the beaches and rise at 5am and stay out til 2am like she does in Mexico. Compared everything to Mexico, even wanting to tip a restaurant owner in USD because ‚ÄúI do it in Mexico‚Äù. Wanted to tip everyone and argued the whole time when I told her don‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs rude and when I got my Japanese friend to educate her on how to give proper thanks, she finds one person online who said its ‚Äúnot required but appreciated‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt stop pressing me about how it‚Äôs so good to tip.

She would ask me how my legs were doing and I‚Äôd answer honestly like ‚Äúyeah they hurt‚Äù and she later mocked and berated me saying it made her feel bad I was complaining about my legs. I never said they hurt out of my own accord nor did I stop what we were doing or ask for breaks. If she asked I said yeah but she‚Äôd rather I‚Äôd lie. I asked if she was thirsty while we waited for open hours and she said no, so I went to find me a coffee shop to grab one real quick. She goes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even want to go there, you should‚Äôve taken me to a real cafe‚Äù- girl I‚Äôm just grabbing ME a drink since you said no.

Doesn‚Äôt believe in itineraries yet hated everywhere I took her so got her friend back home to look up places for her. She had 6 months to look up anything to add but she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt believe in itineraries‚Äù. Got mad I didn‚Äôt order for her when she didn‚Äôt ask me to help. Said ‚Äúif we were in Mexico I would‚Äôve ordered for you.‚Äù All she said was she was thinking about getting a bun today‚Ä¶she didn‚Äôt end up ordering it herself because she didn‚Äôt want to point to it and ask the cashier??? I was standing ten steps away from her, there was no one in line and we were the only ones in the store. Not sure why she didn‚Äôt even attempt to order a bun in the case or ask me to help her. Started saying she should‚Äôve gone on this trip with friend A or friend B to my face. Said she didn‚Äôt like ‚Äútouristy‚Äù areas aka Shibuya, Asakusa, Harajuku‚Ä¶and wanted to go to rural areas while she doesn‚Äôt even speak Japanese and was relying on me to quite literally hold her hand for everything. She‚Äôs older than me but both late 20s btw.

Said she was going to leave the trip early if we spent a day with my sister at our Japanese friends house. She wouldn‚Äôt eat sushi because they have ‚Äúworms in them‚Äù, wouldn‚Äôt go to karaoke because ‚Äúthey were listening‚Äù, said I made her cry which she‚Äôs only ever done at her dads funeral (wow), called dried squid a ‚Äúgag gift she can get her family‚Äù, accused me of cutting her luggage and wouldn‚Äôt take out yen from the atm so I did and she paid me back. Tried to tell me data works fine compared to our pocket WiFi and that we can just leave the WiFi at the hotel when I asked her to hold it for us. (I lived in Japan and will not go anywhere without a pocket WiFi)

This isn‚Äôt even half of it‚Ä¶.a whole 7 day nightmare. For the first time in my life I actually slept through an entire 9 hour plane ride on the way back.

ETA: I totally forgot some of the more f‚Äôd up things like asking ‚Äúdo you have an eating disorder?‚Äù Or telling me she was going to smack my hand because I had it near my nose as I was choking on so much secondhand smoke my throat was getting raspy. And trying to convince me it was my fault that I was getting inappropriate stuff happening to me (ex. man chased me down the streets of ikebukuro wanting to go to a hotel but it‚Äôs my fault because I was standing alone at the station)

ETA 2: anyone want to guess the profession she‚Äôs pursuing?

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP needs to get new friends and how is the friend?**

> **OOP:** I told her off a day after we landed then blocked her everywhere.

+

> She‚Äôs 28. I‚Äôm 26.

**OOP on ending the friendship after the trip** 

> **OOP:** Something about trips and friendships‚Ä¶This girl you would never guess because if you met her she‚Äôs ‚Äúmamma bear‚Äù - polite, well mannered, fiercely independent and caring. I doubt ppl irl would believe this is her. Once she was out of her element, she turned into the literal spawn of satan.

+

> I wanted to leave her so bad but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to because it‚Äôs a very foreign country to her. Once she threatened to leave the trip early though, I literally started looking at flights for her and showed her the options lol. That pissed her off even more because I was ‚Äúon my phone‚Äù all throughout dinner.

**OOP gives an example of her friend‚Äôs reaction when going to a place for breakfast**

> **OOP:** No literally. I left a bunch of stuff out bc it‚Äôs ALOT but our compromise to visiting my friends house was I would go alone for a couple hours while she waited at the hotel. Before I left I convinced her to try going to the konbini (which was right next door to our hotel) alone to get breakfast and she did, came back and said she would never do that again. Wanna know why? Some other foreigner saw her and was trying to chat with her. Idk if he was real or not but she was like ‚Äúyeah see? Nope I‚Äôm not doing that again!‚Äù

+

> She‚Äôs Mexican which is why she kept bringing it up and telling me she was going to force me to go to Mexico so I can see how hard it is to order stuff or whatever. And that she wouldn‚Äôt go to my friends house ‚Äúbecause how would you feel if I took you to Mexico and wanted to visit my BIL?‚Äù But honestly I could‚Äôve used that situation and thrown her misogyny right back at her face. ‚ÄúOh a man talked to you? You must‚Äôve looked approachable or it‚Äôs what you‚Äôre wearing‚Äù -everything she said to me lol

+

> She thought I was crazy to suggest this and that I was wasting her hard earned money to ‚Äúsit around and hang out‚Äù and said that when people want to hang out ‚Äúit means ALL day‚Äù and everyone around her knows that hang out means all day (also said that ‚Äúlater means later today‚Äùwhich was a whole different thing I digress) but instead of asking me how long she flips her bananas and tells me she should‚Äôve gone of this trip with friend A if I wanted to see friends. This is what made her cry

&nbsp;

[Update/Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/83EddE4e5r): **September 27, 2024**

So I got a lot more responses and questions that I thought I would get on my last post. I figured I would share more about it for those who were interested. I also wanted to thank everyone who told me their own story of disaster trips. Some felt really relatable! Also big thank you to those who asked me for Tokyo recommendations and those who said they would‚Äôve been glad to have me as a guide. That made me really happy! I actually had two friendships that ended over that trip and overall I felt really taken advantage of and under appreciated. Thank you all for helping sort some of those feelings by sharing your thoughts. Of course this was a huge lesson learned and I‚Äôll do my best to move forward with more caution and maturity.

A little more context to what I went through: Got mad I told her no, I don‚Äôt need her to hold my bag. Got mad I told her I didn‚Äôt want to walk 1 hr to our destination because she chose the route with 1 train with a ‚Äú40 min‚Äù walk (I chose one with 3 transfers and a 10 min walk). I said I put my compressions in my check-in on accident and she replies ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm smart and packed mine in my backpack‚Äù. Told me she couldn‚Äôt help with adding to the itinerary or join study sessions because she had family issues she didn‚Äôt want to tell me about and didn‚Äôt understand how that doesn‚Äôt give her a pass to complain the whole time. She would agree to leave an area but then make snarky comments about how she liked the previous area more. Told me sarcastically ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always right‚Äù when I tried to tell her she was reading a Japanese persons response wrong. As if I didn‚Äôt know the concept of tatemae and honne lol. 

Blew up at me for being on my phone at dinner - I was navigating the whole time and we shared a hotel/bed, the only time I got to check in with my fam is when we sat down to eat. Kept saying her family (who was tracking her) was asking why we‚Äôre at a laundromat or why we‚Äôre at a mall and not outside. Would compare me to friend A like ‚Äúoh she would‚Äôve understood my joke!‚Äù. 

Used my other friend problem I was having, against me saying she understands why my friend did what she did. Yapped about how she hates Selena Gomez for writing a song about her ex and when I told her nearly every singer/song writer does she told me to list names and so I listed people and she said ‚Äúno, but name male singers though!‚Äù. Heard my fave group XG play in shibuya and when I got excited she goes ‚ÄúEW‚Äù (only because they‚Äôre a girl group). 

Acted like me making an itinerary meant that we couldn‚Äôt walk into random shops along the way. Anytime we went somewhere spontaneously or didn‚Äôt make a reservation she would be like ‚Äúsee? this is how I travel. I just go with the flow because I do better under pressure‚Äù‚Ä¶

Anyways, so some people had mentioned how I didn‚Äôt see any of this behavior prior to going on the trip and I‚Äôll best honest and say there were red flags in our relationship which I saw and I actually did distance myself from her BUT after I moved to Japan and came back, I was in this weird position and really wanted to reconnect with my old friends and establish a support system again. So I decided to start fresh with her which was obviously a mistake and I got what I deserved.

She started changing during the pandemic in which her and friend A got really close as we were barely talking at the time. I talked to a mutual friend of ours recently and we both suspect that friend A had a part in fueling her toxic behavior. We always knew her as a sort of mama bear that took care of everyone and is super well mannered and self righteous. Everyone irl likes her and looks up to her but as one commenter pointed out, these ‚Äúgood‚Äù qualities are actually a disguise. She needs to be in control and once she was out of her element and not in control, she completely lost her cool and was actually very verbally abusive.

Which brings me to the next answer to everyone‚Äôs question, she is pursing to be a detective or police officer. It‚Äôs more fitting rather than ironic. She appears disciplined, morally superior and dominant but she‚Äôs simply judgmental and controlling and it‚Äôs scary to think someone like her will have more power and influence.

The next thing I want to address is people asking why did she even want to go to Japan. I kind of think it‚Äôs simple, I invited her and said I know of good places and can take us around. I think a lot of people in my life want me to take them to Japan because it‚Äôs easier to go with someone who knows how to travel there. She wasn‚Äôt someone who ever dreamed of going to Japan but the opportunity came up and she took it. She‚Äôs more of a koreaboo tbh but nevertheless she was excited to go. She even started texting friend A on our trip saying they were gonna make it up to her and go to Kyoto next year and that I could join lol. Even though she told me to my face ‚Äúno offense but I‚Äôm never traveling with you again‚Äù.

The last thing people are asking is what I said to her when I ended it. So when we got back to the states, basically I started blocking her on everything. I argued with her for 7 days and everything that came out of her mouth was a complaint or insult so I had zero energy to go back and forth. I already know that nothing will change her mind or open her eyes. She texted me asking why she couldn‚Äôt find my username anymore and I said this:

‚ÄúGirl, no way we are friends anymore after the way you behaved all throughout the trip. Never in my life have I heard a grown adult complain that much and not know how to communicate without an attitude, gaslighting, and being condescending. You are ethnocentric, extremely judgmental and ableist. You say a lot of racist micro-aggressions and misogynistic things. And the fact that people can‚Äôt even be honest with you or that you can‚Äôt be honest with others is wild. You‚Äôd rather not hear the truth bc honesty makes you feel bad. The entire time you talked about how you normally do things with your friends and family and all it told me was that you‚Äôre not very adaptable! But yeah there was way too many unpleasant behavior and things said that showed your true colors and I don‚Äôt want any further involvement.‚Äù

Then I blocked her. But I got a new phone and saw she read it. So that‚Äôs that! I‚Äôm not hurt but I‚Äôm really bummed about my trip to Japan being ruined.

It was such a pleasent smell, fresh yet woody. It really gave off the vibe of someone ready to start off the day with peak energy with utmost seriousness.

However, it only projected for like 30 minutes, and then goes away. Does not even linger on body. 

Could any one recommend any long lasting/ projecting alternatives having blood orange + sandalwood notes.
I'm looking to wear this everyday (AC env. office, coffee catchups outside). 

Also, any other recommendations that inclines towards fresh woody smell would also be appreciated.

1fvqcew,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1fvqcew/kicked_out_of_the_house_by_guardian/,Kicked out of the house by guardian.,"Well shit. It happened.

Mustered my bravery and came out to my guardian.

Got yelled at screamed at for hours then told to pack my bags.

And now everything is ruined.

I'm no longer on their insurance so no medical care for my illness or HRT (didn't start yet).

I'm no longer getting my college fund so no college.

I'm no longer in the house so now I'm homeless.

Wasted my entire life to please them, went through illness after injury because of them (abuse, medical neglect), let them traffic me for years -- all of the pain, for fucking nothing.

I am now an orphan, except I don't get all the juicy state benefits for having dead parents. To think that if they were dead I would receive my education and healthcare at no extra cost. Wow. Am I that fucked that orphans and foster care kids are privileged in comparison to me? I think I'm losing my mind.

Weirdly enough, I've felt suicidal my entire life, but right now I'm fine. Like, neutral. I don't feel anything. Just blank. I have no idea what's going to happen tomorrow. There's absolutely zero plan in my life. And I just feel... blank?

You know? I think this conclusion was bound to happen. I should've known. My guardian is religious, you know? Muslim. I was conceived from rape... and you guessed it! No abortion! Fuckkk that would've been good if that happened. But what I mean by this is that my life was ruined from the start.

There was familial pressure and my parents had to marry! But of course it didn't really work out. Always fighting. Got CPS called on me before I can even remember. My fucking god. If they had taken from that house then... It would've been glorious. Or maybe not. I researched it and the entire point of Foster Care is to like... take you back to your parents when they pretend that they are better. Would I have experienced a good life with good parents just to get taken back to the shithole? I wonder. Honestly, I was right before. I should've just been aborted.

But still, if they reviewed my case, they would've known wouldn't they? Like, I have a facial scar from when I was a toddler. I was slashed in the face by a knife and have a permanent facial scar over my eye and brow... Did the CPS worker see that? What were they even thinking. If I were them, I would've taken me back permanently. But well that's just life right. Can't expect my parents to be competent at their one job, so what I am expecting from that guy or girl???

But it is kind of a comforting thought: It was over from the beginning. Nobody could be born in my environment and been anything special. If Einstein or Musk or Obama or Kamala Harris were born in my shoes, they would be 6 feet deep right about now. But thinking about my supposed resilience  doesn't even make me happy. All I can think about now is if I had the potential to become one of those special people had I been raised in a loving environment. You know, even the successful people who were poor had at least one person on their side, I had nobody from the start.

You know, I'm typing this from public wifi. A couple seats away from me is this homeless guy. His clothes are dirty, he can only afford like one coffee, and he looks to be addicted to something. I think that's going to me. I think that's going to be me. When you think about it, every homeless person, criminal and drug addict was a kid, right? Probably a happy one too right. When they were 5, they must have been living it up. Carefree, peaceful, innocent. Infinite potential waiting to be squashed by the cold, cruel world. You know, I don't think there's any people born bad. We are all made bad throughout our lives. I remember this one quote from Batman or something. ""Just one day... just one day..."" to completely ruin a ""good"" person. I totally understand it now.

Ah... I'm rambling.

I don't really know what to do. I guess I need to go find a job, but nobody can find one these days between the greedy CEO's and the automation. Meh. AI is going to ruin the job market in a couple of years. I don't even have the time to have a career because I was born in the 21st century. Maybe that's a good thing? If there's no hope, there's less despair. Even if I were to have the opportunity to go to college, by the time I graduate, every job would probably be automated. So maybe my situation is a good thing???

But still, I need to eat. So I need to get a job. I guess I'll ask the homeless shelter or something. But still, what's the point? No college. No job. No career. No friends. No family. World's going to be fucked up in 5 years. Maybe if I were born in 1970 I could've turned things around. World was simpler back then.

Fuck. Honestly, I say that I don't care and feel blank, yet I write all this nonsense. Sorry for wasting your time readers.

I think I'm just gonna drain my wallet and get the HRT, then inject it into me all at once. I can die in euphoria being a girl. Hell, I'd probably die of the sudden euphoria with how shitty I feel now.

I (F33) live in a regional coastal town in Australia, and used to work in a great little family run cafe. Think great coffee, yum food, beautiful garden courtyard, and mostly wonderful customers.

One summer, during school hols, on a heaving Sunday morning, I was zooming around doing a quick dish run and started clearing some empty mugs from an older lady (60s) with her 2 young grandchildren. She had just received her breakfast and was adding condiments to her 2 pieces of toast. 

She stopped me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just looking at the menu and I can see that I paid the same price ($3) for each of these two pieces of toast, but ‚Ä¶ they aren‚Äôt exactly the same size‚Äù. 

I look at her toast and they are both large, but one is approx. 10% smaller than the other, so I assume she‚Äôs just making convo and I smile, say ‚Äúyeah‚Äù, continue grabbing items. 

She stares at me and says again ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt the same size, but I paid the same for each of them, that‚Äôs not really fair?‚Äù 

I realise she‚Äôs serious and start telling her that this is because we use a local, handmade sourdough from a beautiful wood fired bakery baked literally just 7km away. The loaves are rustic not factory perfect. She‚Äôs not having a bar of what I‚Äôm saying, insisting she‚Äôs paid the same price and she wants two piece of toast the same size. This is when my incredulity ends and my petty steps in. Cue malicious compliance. 

‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll be back in a couple of minutes‚Äù. 

I take her toast into my boss (F33), tell her the story, and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúsay no more friend, I‚Äôve got it‚Äù, proceeds to cuts two equal size slices of bread from the smaller end of a loaf, and toasts them perfectly. 

I then have the pleasure of taking two pieces of obviously smaller toast to the lady, and say ‚Äòhere‚Äôs your two pieces of toast - the same size!‚Äô. The look of shock, turn anger, turn embarrassment on her face was absolutely delicious.

What now?","I (40m) get tonsil stones often, have since my early twenties. I have excellent oral hygiene. Not a single cavity ever, I brush, floss, and use mouthwash daily. I will rinse and/or do a light brushing after meals or coffee. I have to extract the stones at least once per week and will get about thumbnail size amount of stones each time. If I go more than about 10 days, I will get loose stones in my mouth/throat and my wife will say she can smell them in my breath, even if I just brushed and rinsed. As soon as I extract them and rinse again, the smell is gone. I can sometimes tell when my co-workers smell them. It is extremely embarrassing. I‚Äôve told them about the condition and apologized to them if they happen to fall victim to the smell. It doesn‚Äôt happen often but to me once is one too many times. 

I explained all this to the resident doctor. He said I‚Äôd likely be a good candidate for the procedure. Then the actual doctor came in. Without directly saying, ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt get this procedure,‚Äù that is basically what he said. He said a tonsillectomy is a major surgery and the risks are quite high, especially for an adult/someone 40+. They said they‚Äôve conducted thousands of procedures, but only a handful of them were because of tonsils stones. Also said that tonsil stones don‚Äôt cause bad breath and the bad breath was because I needed to brush, floss, and use mouth wash more. I shared my anecdote about my wife smelling them and about my oral hygiene practices. He then again said that the procedure is a major surgery and really should only be done if the tonsils are always infected and nothing else works, and that removing them for tonsil stones really isn‚Äôt an effective ‚Äúcure‚Äù.

1fvq5af,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1fvq5af/help/,Help ,"Hi, I have an 18-year-old female, highly functioning daughter who since her 18 birthday a month ago has turned into a monster.
Between the gender dysphoria that sprung up and be very aggressive and nasty disposition because ‚Äúshe is an adult‚Äú I don‚Äôt know what to do. 
She screams at us,she curses at us and acts as If we know nothing, she knows everything. 
Now I know this is the way that teenagers act, I have two other grown children , ONE is 36 years old and the other is 32 The 32 year-old lives with me along with his wife and my two grandchildren ages two and three.
So basically the beginning of her 17th year  she was just testing the waters know I have nothing against transgender people or anybody who‚Äôs LGBTQ group. My mother was with a woman who I call my mom#2 for 35 years so needless to say I‚Äôm not homophobic .
But since my now 18 year old daughter feels that she is a male it has gotten very bad and she has called me, trans phobic she wants to go and get testosterone and all I ask her is to please wait until she is a little bit older because of the whole Hormones and the side effects.
Naturally, we don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre talking about and she still throwing her way around and trying to see how far she can push us. 
It Has gotten to the point where she would constantly threaten that she was going to move in with her friends, and I finally said, pack up and go. Another thing I should mention about my daughter is that we had given her everything she is extremely spoiled and does not know what it‚Äôs like to go without anything. She was also sheltered her whole life. She doesn‚Äôt know how to do simple tasks like laundry or how to make coffee.
We take full blame for this..
Anybody please give me some good advice don‚Äôt say anything mean.

Doctor basically said I shouldn‚Äôt do the procedure‚Ä¶ FML.,"I (40m) get tonsil stones often, have since my early twenties. I have excellent oral hygiene. Not a single cavity ever, I brush, floss, and use mouthwash daily. I will rinse and/or do a light brushing after meals or coffee. I have to extract the stones at least once per week and will get about thumbnail size amount of stones each time. If I go more than about 10 days, I will get loose stones in my mouth/throat and my wife will say she can smell them in my breath, even if I just brushed and rinsed. As soon as I extract them and rinse again, the smell is gone. I can sometimes tell when my co-workers smell them. It is extremely embarrassing. I‚Äôve told them about the condition and apologized to them if they happen to fall victim to the smell. It doesn‚Äôt happen often but to me once is one too many times. 

I explained all this to the resident doctor. He said I‚Äôd likely be a good candidate for the procedure. Then the actual doctor came in. Without directly saying, ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt get this procedure,‚Äù that is basically what he said. He said a tonsillectomy is a major surgery and the risks are quite high, especially for an adult/someone 40+. They said they‚Äôve conducted thousands of procedures, but only a handful of them were because of tonsils stones. Also said that tonsil stones don‚Äôt cause bad breath and the bad breath was because I needed to brush, floss, and use mouth wash more. I shared my anecdote about my wife smelling them and about my oral hygiene practices. He then again said that the procedure is a major surgery and really should only be done if the tonsils are always infected and nothing else works, and that removing them for tonsil stones really isn‚Äôt an effective ‚Äúcure‚Äù.

1fvq0nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1fvq0nd/how_do_you_think_the_way_chocolate_is_marketed/,How do you think the way chocolate is marketed and sold will change as prices increase?,"As chocolate prices increase due to rising costs of raw materials like cocoa, sugar, and dairy, the way it is marketed and sold is likely to shift in several ways. Companies will need to balance higher costs with consumer expectations, and this will drive changes in product positioning, packaging, pricing strategies, and marketing narratives. (If you are looking for ways to increase sales using AI then click DigiProducts in my bio)

## 1. Premiumization and Craft Chocolate

* **Premium positioning**: As prices rise, chocolate brands may emphasize quality, sourcing, and craftsmanship to justify the higher costs. Expect more focus on **artisan chocolate**, single-origin cocoa, ethical sourcing (e.g., Fair Trade or Rainforest Alliance), and luxury branding. Brands will promote the idea that higher prices reflect higher quality, sustainability, and exclusivity.
* **Experiential marketing**: Consumers will be sold on the *experience* of enjoying premium chocolate, with storytelling around the origin of ingredients, the care in production, and the unique flavors. Premium chocolates will be positioned as indulgent or gift-worthy items, appealing to consumers willing to pay for quality.

## 2. Smaller Sizes or Portion Control

* To keep prices more accessible, companies may start offering **smaller portions** or limited-edition packaging. By focusing on portion control, they can maintain consumer affordability while subtly increasing the price per gram. These smaller offerings can also align with health trends encouraging mindful eating and moderation.
* **Snacking trends**: There may also be an increase in marketing toward chocolate as a snack or mini treat. Brands could market smaller packs with more flavor variety, encouraging impulse buys despite higher prices.

## 3. Focus on Ethical and Sustainable Practices

* **Sustainability as a selling point**: Higher prices might be justified through a focus on ethical sourcing and sustainability. More chocolate brands could pivot toward marketing their environmental initiatives, such as reducing plastic packaging, using recyclable materials, or focusing on the well-being of cocoa farmers.
* **Transparency in the supply chain**: Consumers are increasingly concerned about ethical consumption. Brands could highlight their efforts to combat child labor in cocoa farming or reduce their carbon footprint, using these as key selling points even if prices are higher.

## 4. Innovative Flavors and Ingredients

* With rising costs, brands may differentiate themselves by offering innovative and exotic flavors. For example, incorporating **superfoods**, **alternative sweeteners** (like stevia or monk fruit), or unique ingredients like herbs and spices can allow brands to justify premium pricing while tapping into health and wellness trends.
* **Product diversification**: Companies could expand into adjacent categories such as vegan or dairy-free chocolates, low-sugar varieties, or chocolates infused with ingredients like CBD, catering to niche markets willing to pay higher prices for specialized products.

## 5. Subscription Services and Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Models

* As brick-and-mortar retail continues to evolve, chocolate brands might push more into **subscription services** and **DTC sales**. Monthly chocolate boxes or specialty chocolate clubs can provide consumers with variety, exclusivity, and convenience while helping brands manage inventory and build a loyal customer base.
* **Personalization**: DTC models also allow for more personalized offerings, where customers can choose flavors, packaging, or even craft their own blends, adding value that offsets the rising price.

## 6. Health and Functional Benefits

* Chocolates marketed with **functional benefits**, such as high-antioxidant content, mood-boosting properties, or gut health, will become more prominent. Brands may position their chocolates as not only indulgent but also beneficial to health, encouraging consumers to see it as a justified ""investment"" in well-being.

## 7. Loyalty Programs and Bundling

* In response to price increases, brands may offer loyalty programs to retain customers or promote value through **bundling deals**. Bundling chocolate with other complementary items (e.g., coffee, wine, or gift baskets) could help justify the price while enhancing perceived value.

## 8. Digital Marketing and E-commerce

* As competition increases, especially in the premium segment, companies may focus on **targeted digital marketing** campaigns through social media, influencers, and user-generated content. **Experiential marketing** like virtual chocolate-tasting events or storytelling through video can elevate the perceived value of chocolate, even as costs rise.
* **E-commerce platforms**: The shift to online sales will likely accelerate, with more brands using online platforms to offer exclusive products or deals, leveraging data analytics to personalize offers.

## 9. Private Labels and Discount Brands

* In response to rising prices, there may also be growth in **private label** or discount brands offering more affordable options to price-sensitive consumers. Retailers could focus on delivering chocolate products at a lower price point, albeit with fewer luxury or ethical features than premium brands.

In summary, as chocolate prices increase, the marketing will shift toward **premiumization, sustainability, health benefits**, and **smaller portion sizes**, with brands using storytelling, ethical practices, and innovation to justify higher prices. At the same time, there will likely be strategies to cater to price-sensitive consumers through smaller formats, bundling, and value offerings.",1,1728012619.0,digimarketeronline,0,1.0,False

This week I ran into an old university classmate at a networking event. 

My degree was a 5 year course. As mine and this guy‚Äôs surnames were near each other in the alphabet, we ended up getting paired/ grouped together a lot throughout the first 4 years. I saw very little of him in our final year. 

My experiences of him in the first 3 years of university were extremely negative. Typical popular jock kinda guy. He was very rude, arrogant and generally intimidating. For whatever reason, he took a disliking to me within our first few weeks of school and he went out of his way to be nasty thereafter. It was honestly a really upsetting and traumatic time and I had to have a lot of support from my family through it. I‚Äôm now in therapy about the bullying from him and his friends, amongst other things.

One time in our 3rd year, I stood up to him. I just snapped. He‚Äôd been rude again in front of other people and I‚Äôd had enough. But needless to say, from here, things changed. I think me snapping instilled some sort of respect for me in him, and his demeanour toward me changed entirely. He began speaking to me softly, complimenting me (e.g. I remember once he told me my voice was calm and soothing), being near me more, and one time on a class night out, he tried to come onto me. Just the one time. We never spoke about/ addressed it after. He was very drunk. He also expressed jealousy one time I was talking about another guy with my girl friend and he was within earshot. So, I figured he‚Äôd become attracted to me in some way. As I said, after that incident in our 3rd year, he changed. He never apologised, but he was nice to me. He started referring to me by an endearing nickname. He would have considered us friends, I‚Äôm sure. This continued for the rest of 3rd and 4th year.

Honestly, I never saw him as a friend. I was civil and polite but I always secretly resented him. I felt such deep hurt from him. I‚Äôll admit, it probably was fake of me. But I was just relieved he was not bullying me anymore. I‚Äôd been his victim for 2.5 years and I was grateful for a bit of peace, though I never felt comfortable around him. I was always on edge. 

In our final year we mercifully got moved to different groupings and I hardly ever saw him or spoke to him again. When we graduated I removed him off Facebook and Instagram and just wanted to move on with my life. 

As I said, I‚Äôm now in therapy and working on my PTSD diagnosis. He and his friends are largely responsible for it, I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it. Imagine near-daily bullying from grown men for 2.5 years of your early formative adult years. I don‚Äôt think I need to say how very damaging it can be for a young woman. 

Fast forward to this week, we‚Äôre now just over 3 years out of uni. I haven‚Äôt seen him since our final year. I was at a networking event/ conference for my industry, which is a very close-knit industry. 

My stomach drops and dread seizes me when I see him across the conference hall. I hope to God he doesn‚Äôt see me too, but he does. Oh does he notice me. He comes over and looks happy to see me. We catch up briefly, and then to my dismay he decides to sit next to me for 2 of the lectures. The feelings I thought I‚Äôd been dealing with came rushing up again like a tidal wave. It‚Äôs so much easier to ‚Äòforgive and move on‚Äô when you don‚Äôt have to see the people who trigger you. But he was right there next to me, acting like old friends‚Ä¶ which, I guess, in his mind - we probably are. 

There were 4 other people from our school at the event, people from the years above or below, and after the event ended I was invited to a pub to catch up with the other alumni informally. Of course, he was there too, and decided he wanted to sit next to me again for most of the night. At this point, I was a bit more comfortable. I guess because the initial shock had worn off, and I‚Äôd been giving myself mental peptalks for like 4 hours at this point. 

But then, he shocked me entirely at the bar. He came with me to order a drink and paid for mine. There at the bar he admitted that he‚Äôd like to see me again, and that he‚Äôd thought about me a lot since we graduated. 

I guess with a few drinks down me, I was feeling bold, and also because I‚Äôm working on assertiveness. I said something along the lines of, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been thinking about me? Including all the times you were an absolute dick to me?‚Äù I‚Äôll admit, it was satisfying seeing his face drop. Maybe that makes me a bad person, idk. He replied looking very sheepish, ‚Äúoh yeah.. I‚Äôm really sorry about that. I thought we‚Äôd put it behind us‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have any excuse.‚Äù

I got so mad that I nearly teared up. I don‚Äôt think I showed just how mad I was, but I did say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre saying sorry now? That seems pretty convenient.‚Äù He thought we‚Äôd put it behind us? How fucking easy for him. Had he ever apologised or addressed how he‚Äôd treated me before that? Was he just saying it now that I‚Äôd called him out and he is interested in me? I just excused myself from the bar and went back to sit with everyone else. I didn‚Äôt exactly ignore him for the rest of the night, it was an intimate group, but I kept my distance and he seemed to pick up on the cue and left me alone. 

A few days since have passed and it‚Äôs been turmoil. Then to top it off, yesterday he sent me a VERY long message request. In short, he apologised for how he treated me at university.

Tell him you‚Äôd never consider him, that you were never friends, that you hated him all along. My parents would say never speak to him again. My dad would honestly beat him up if he could. 

I guess I‚Äôm answering my own question? I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm curious about entertaining this meeting.

Apologies. Essay incoming. 

This week I ran into an old university classmate at a networking event. 

My degree was a 5 year course. As mine and this guy‚Äôs surnames were near each other in the alphabet, we ended up getting paired/ grouped together a lot throughout the first 4 years. I saw very little of him in our final year. 

My experiences of him in the first 3 years of university were extremely negative. Typical popular jock kinda guy. He was very rude, arrogant and generally intimidating. For whatever reason, he took a disliking to me within our first few weeks of school and he went out of his way to be nasty thereafter. It was honestly a really upsetting and traumatic time and I had to have a lot of support from my family through it. I‚Äôm now in therapy about the bullying from him and his friends, amongst other things.

One time in our 3rd year, I stood up to him. I just snapped. He‚Äôd been rude again in front of other people and I‚Äôd had enough. But needless to say, from here, things changed. I think me snapping instilled some sort of respect for me in him, and his demeanour toward me changed entirely. He began speaking to me softly, complimenting me (e.g. I remember once he told me my voice was calm and soothing), being near me more, and one time on a class night out, he tried to come onto me. Just the one time. We never spoke about/ addressed it after. He was very drunk. He also expressed jealousy one time I was talking about another guy with my girl friend and he was within earshot. So, I figured he‚Äôd become attracted to me in some way. As I said, after that incident in our 3rd year, he changed. He never apologised, but he was nice to me. He started referring to me by an endearing nickname. He would have considered us friends, I‚Äôm sure. This continued for the rest of 3rd and 4th year.

Honestly, I never saw him as a friend. I was civil and polite but I always secretly resented him. I felt such deep hurt from him. I‚Äôll admit, it probably was fake of me. But I was just relieved he was not bullying me anymore. I‚Äôd been his victim for 2.5 years and I was grateful for a bit of peace, though I never felt comfortable around him. I was always on edge. 

In our final year we mercifully got moved to different groupings and I hardly ever saw him or spoke to him again. When we graduated I removed him off Facebook and Instagram and just wanted to move on with my life. 

As I said, I‚Äôm now in therapy and working on my PTSD diagnosis. He and his friends are largely responsible for it, I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it. Imagine near-daily bullying from grown men for 2.5 years of your early formative adult years. I don‚Äôt think I need to say how very damaging it can be for a young woman. 

Fast forward to this week, we‚Äôre now just over 3 years out of uni. I haven‚Äôt seen him since our final year. I was at a networking event/ conference for my industry, which is a very close-knit industry. 

My stomach drops and dread seizes me when I see him across the conference hall. I hope to God he doesn‚Äôt see me too, but he does. Oh does he notice me. He comes over and looks happy to see me. We catch up briefly, and then to my dismay he decides to sit next to me for 2 of the lectures. The feelings I thought I‚Äôd been dealing with came rushing up again like a tidal wave. It‚Äôs so much easier to ‚Äòforgive and move on‚Äô when you don‚Äôt have to see the people who trigger you. But he was right there next to me, acting like old friends‚Ä¶ which, I guess, in his mind - we probably are. 

There were 4 other people from our school at the event, people from the years above or below, and after the event ended I was invited to a pub to catch up with the other alumni informally. Of course, he was there too, and decided he wanted to sit next to me again for most of the night. At this point, I was a bit more comfortable. I guess because the initial shock had worn off, and I‚Äôd been giving myself mental peptalks for like 4 hours at this point. 

But then, he shocked me entirely at the bar. He came with me to order a drink and paid for mine. There at the bar he admitted that he‚Äôd like to see me again, and that he‚Äôd thought about me a lot since we graduated. 

I guess with a few drinks down me, I was feeling bold, and also because I‚Äôm working on assertiveness. I said something along the lines of, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been thinking about me? Including all the times you were an absolute d**k to me?‚Äù I‚Äôll admit, it was satisfying seeing his face drop. Maybe that makes me a bad person, idk. He replied looking very sheepish, ‚Äúoh yeah.. I‚Äôm really sorry about that. I thought we‚Äôd put it behind us‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have any excuse.‚Äù

I got so mad that I nearly teared up. I don‚Äôt think I showed just how mad I was, but I did say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre saying sorry now? That seems pretty convenient.‚Äù He thought we‚Äôd put it behind us? How easy for him. Had he ever apologised or addressed how he‚Äôd treated me before that? Was he just saying it now that I‚Äôd called him out and he is interested in me? I just excused myself from the bar and went back to sit with everyone else. I didn‚Äôt exactly ignore him for the rest of the night, it was an intimate group, but I kept my distance and he seemed to pick up on the cue and left me alone. 

A few days since have passed and it‚Äôs been turmoil. Then to top it off, yesterday he sent me a VERY long message request. In short, he apologised for how he treated me at university. He said he genuinely thought we had become friends and moved past it, and that he had noticed I‚Äôd unfriended him on social media since graduating but didn‚Äôt read too much into it, just thinking that we‚Äôd grown apart in our final year. But now he can see that he‚Äôs obviously hurt me. He said he‚Äôd been unkind to me because I‚Äôd rejected his friend in our first year, and that friend had gotten all of his ‚Äòboys‚Äô to turn on me!?! (NEWS TO ME. now I FINALLY know why they were all so horrible!!!) He then went on to say of course that wasn‚Äôt an excuse, but it was the honest reason, and he‚Äôd grown since he was 18-21 and was a different man now, and that he hopes I can forgive him and give him a chance. He said that ‚Äútruthfully‚Äù he‚Äôs liked me for a long time and that he‚Äôd like to go for coffee this weekend to talk this all out.

I may have sung a lot of Red Wine Supernova and Pink Pony Club around the house this year and in light of that my sister decided to make ""stars"" our annual Halloween party theme. (Guests are free to interpret this however they want-- pop stars, outer space, etc.) 

I've been assigned the task of organizing drinks based off of Chappell's songs, which has landed me in an exciting pickle! I don't have any mixing experience and I don't have much of a taste for alcohol. I'll be able to get most ingredients and equipment within reason (strainers, shakers, etc) but I might have some trouble if anything requires advanced bartending techniques or barista equipment like an espresso machine. I was thinking I'd stick to a small selection of 3-4 drinks, some alcoholic and some non-alcoholic. But I wondered if you guys could help me find some inspiration.

I have some really basic ideas floating aroundüòÖ:

- Pink Pony Club - some kind of pink cocktail or mocktail. I was thinking of incorporating a fruit that grows well in Southern California to reflect Santa Monica (like pomegranate or lemon), and maybe another fruit or garnish that reflects Tennessee (persimmons, blackberries). I think lemon and blackberry could go together reasonably well! If there's some way for me to incorporate something sparkly and shiny that's a plus.

- Red Wine Supernova - mulled wine sounds like a good choice for late October, and of course a drink based off of this song would need to incorporate red wine! I'm not too sure how to emphasize the sheer queer joy of the song though, maybe using star anise as one of the spices could incorporate some of that supernova feeling?

- Naked In Manhattan - I think there's a drink called the Naked and Famous and another drink called the Manhattan? I could try incorporating some ingredients from both drinks, but what parts would work well together? It might be too on the nose. I could go for a different angle and try to make a peachy, creamy drink instead, like a peach seltzer + syrup + vanilla ice cream float?

- Casual - I feel like this should be a kind of complicated drink (or at least seem complicated) with a simple presentation to reflect the conflict in the song. For some reason I'm leaning towards a matcha or coffee-flavored drink because these are bitter, complicated flavors.

Which drinks sound the most promising to you? please feel free to drop your own ideas and suggestions too!! I appreciate any pointers; like I said, I don't really drink so I'm not sure what'd taste good üò≠ thank you so much!",3,1728011487.0,chappellroan,1,1.0,False

She wound up cancelling because she was sick (I was honestly relieved because I was too). We don't have a day/time set, but she asked me out on a coffee date for next week. I haven't dated in a while, so I am super nervous about all of this. 

I have this cute white dress with black pin dots that I think I might wear, but is that too much for a coffee date? I was thinking of dressing it down a bit with boots or something. Another thing about it is if I wear a push-up bra, it makes the girls look *giant*. I don't know if coffee date is really for showing off cleavage though, so normal or push-up bra? It's also a shorter dress that I wear mostly in the summer. Should I try something more fall? I never wear makeup, but should I put a little bit on? Or not wear it because it doesn't really represent me? I am already planning on shaving my legs for the date, which I haven't done in about a year, so I guess that isn't really ""me"" either. 

Sorry I am all over the place. We hit it off immediately after matching, so I really want to make a good first impression. I am also extremely nervous. This is the first time in five years that I am going on a date, so any and all outfit/looks advice would be appreciated. Thank you!!

I was diagnosed with PCOs at 11\~, and was basically told 'your periods are going to be painful forever, and your ovaries have cysts, bye'. I never thought to look into it more until this very year, now that I'm 23, because I have bigger fish to fry (other various health issues). I saw a video that said, 'hey, PCOs can be the cause of these symptoms', and it also explained insulin resistance and the likes, and I was suddenly like, 'holy shit, that explains so much'.

I recently got my annual physical, and basically everything else was fine - I was low on vitamin D, but everything else was in normal ranges. However, my doctor warned me that while I wasn't prediabetic, or diabetic, I was 'flirting' with it, and to watch my carbs. Cool!

I've heard people say that before, and never knew what it really meant, because I've had way too many people in my life go down the rabbit hole of diets or calorie counting leading to disordered eating, and I don't mind being fat myself, so it was like, 'whatever', as long as it wasn't hurting me.

But, now that my doctor's told me to watch it, I'm gonna take her as seriously as I can - I looked into carbs and... Wow, okay, so anything that's enjoyable to eat, basically. I don't eat much in general (I don't have a big appetite), and I'm certainly not a sweets person (I have a cup of coffee every day, but rarely anything else, and I only drink water, but will treat myself to a root beer every other day if I'm feeling like it), so it's not like I can just cut out sugar instead (I'd gladly sacrifice sugar for pasta).

I'm the person who cooks in my house. I buy all the groceries on a limited budget, and I feed 5 people with it. I make dinner every night, and I'd say I'm a pretty good cook. Problem is, I love pasta. God, I love pasta. So many of my recipes involve pasta of some sort. I make an amazing alfredo, I make good lasagnas, beef stroganoff, spaghetti, chicken noodle soup, chicken and gnocchi - I have discovered that, in my food, I love carbs.

My thought process for how to handle this is:

Make more meats and vegetables than I already do (I make a mean pot roast, porkchops, chicken...), instead of relying so much on bread and noodles, and switch the bread I buy over to whole grain breads and noodles. I know those obviously still have carbs in them, but I'm not going to just never eat bread and pasta, so I figure going for 'less' is better, especially since my doctor just said to watch my carbs.

I'm going to try and stay just below the range a Google search pops up with for how much I should be eating. I'm ALSO going to cut coffee - it was time, anyway - and probably just avoid sugar in general. Root beer, my beloved, will probably be taking a massive backseat, and I'm going to try and limit myself to one basically once a week.

Any recommendations on other things I could do/should do instead? Oh gosh, and snack food recommendations, too - my stress snack is salt and vinegar chips, I don't know what I'm going to do instead.",7,1728011124.0,PCOS,23,0.89,False
1fvpjtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_julylifecoach/comments/1fvpjtr/why_i_cant_write_during_the_day/,Why I can't write during the day,"This is a bit of a meta-writing because I‚Äôm trying to change this habit. You‚Äôre witnessing a habit change in progress! Every day after dinner I sit down on my sofa with my laptop to start writing. I don‚Äôt know why but at this time the writing just starts flowing through me. After sending the writing to my various platforms I go to my computer to record my YouTube videos. Then I wash up and go to sleep. This doesn‚Äôt really give me a ton of time to connect with my wife after dinner and I‚Äôd like to do that a bit more. Naturally I told myself, ‚Äújust write earlier!‚Äù and I tried that multiple times in the past but due to 1) work, 2) business, and 3) homekeeping and chores I couldn‚Äôt get to regularly writing in the morning.

What‚Äôs the best thing about practicing Buddhism? I think it‚Äôs developing the ability to try again no matter how many times it doesn‚Äôt work. So here I am trying again to write earlier in the day. But as I write this I notice something: the word ‚Äútry‚Äù. Why am I ‚Äútrying‚Äù, instead of doing? When I eat my lunch and dinner I don‚Äôt try and eat lunch and dinner. When I drink my morning coffee I don‚Äôt try to drink. I try and eat when I‚Äôm so occupied with something in hyperfocus and need to take myself out. So I‚Äôm trying to write because I‚Äôm doing something else and am trying to take myself out of that. What am I doing?

First of all I‚Äôm on the computer and I‚Äôm context switching between so many different things. I‚Äôm writing code on one screen, I‚Äôm talking to my coworkers on slack on another screen, and while code is running I‚Äôm taking care of administrative duties, responding to clients who email / dm me, taking note of what topics I could talk about for my YouTube videos today, and so on. Then my dog comes next to me wanting to pee so I take the dog outside and all the context is snapshotted and waiting for me on the computer when I get back. This lets me know, ‚Äòhmm perhaps during the day I‚Äôm simply too occupied with things that can only be done during the day, like work meetings and such‚Äô.

This also lets me evaluate my presuppositions. What am I assuming for this statement to feel true to me, because trueness is not an inherent quality in anything? The statement is only true if 1) there is a limit to my attention and 2) there are only a limited number of things that can be done in a day (other miscellaneous presuppositions are things like I can‚Äôt miss work meetings or certain things are more important than others). Life has always told me whatever I think is the limit becomes the limit simply because I believe it to be true, and I am always astounded by how silly it was to participate within imaginary confines simply because I thought it was there. It‚Äôs like the whole bug (or snail?) enclosed within a circle drawn with a marker situation. The marker seems like an actual border that leads to a cliff but it‚Äôs not.

It‚Äôs up to me to change my heart but it‚Äôs always nice to start the motivation process via external stimulus. Suppose my wife said ‚Äúwe have to go do something important in the evening and you won‚Äôt have time to write today. If you want to write you have to do it during the day‚Äù. Then I realize I have 15 meetings and 5 client sessions during the day. What am I going to do? Well, I might just forgo writing for that day. This is fine, I don‚Äôt have to write every day. But this isn‚Äôt what I want, I want the ability to write every day. Could we raise the stakes? For example my wife could say, ‚ÄúOh by the way there was a local devil that hit me up and let me know that if you don‚Äôt publish a writing today they‚Äôre going to torture me‚Äù. I‚Äôm okay with me being tortured because I can handle my experience but I don‚Äôt want my wife being tortured so I‚Äôll write even with all those restrictions, I‚Äôll find a way. Perhaps in the work meetings that don‚Äôt require my constant focus I‚Äôll write. Perhaps I‚Äôll voice transcribe what I want to write while I do the dishes and the vacuum.

How do I feel as I‚Äôm engaging in this practice? Well, I hate it! There‚Äôs so much pressure and stress. Whenever something feels off, I like to recall back to meditation because meditation is like the ideal state to be in; I‚Äôm relaxed but focused (that‚Äôs the progression of meditation; we start from sitting meditation but we progress to walking meditation and tea ceremonies and such). I can see that I‚Äôm focused but I‚Äôm not relaxed. So how do I remove the stress and become focused? This requires inquiry about what makes me stressed and so I focus on my stress and become curious about what the primary driver of it is. When I pay attention to the brain noise as I‚Äôm engaging in writing during a meeting, I hear the voice ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt focus‚Äù. But that is a lie because I‚Äôm focusing on thinking I can‚Äôt focus. I briefly thank my experience with covid because at that time I truly experienced what it‚Äôs like to not have focus; I literally could not think at all. It‚Äôs not that, so I know I can focus but I‚Äôm just focused on thinking I can‚Äôt focus.

There are many thoughts that happen in my head but for some reason the ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt focus‚Äù thought is taking priority over all other thoughts. Why? My unconscious thinks the fact that I feel like I can‚Äôt focus is important. When I inquire about why more and more, I get to a satisfactory answer: It‚Äôs because when I can‚Äôt focus, my output won‚Äôt be good. Ah, the ages old problem: I‚Äôm not good enough. Thankfully I‚Äôve solved this problem so many times I know the solution in the back of my head: 1) I‚Äôm not this guy who‚Äôs supposed to be good at everything, 2) what‚Äôs not good for me may be good for somebody else because good is not an inherent quality, and 3) this is something I haven‚Äôt done many times so of course I‚Äôm bad at it, wouldn‚Äôt it be unfair to the people who put in the time and work to get good at the skill of doing a lot of things at the same time?

As soon as I realize ‚ÄúAh! Instead of just writing without trying to write, I‚Äôve been occupied with doing a good job and trying to write!‚Äù I let go of the doing a good job and just write. Like I‚Äôm doing right now. This is how I solve my own problems and while this can be informative to you you might be wondering ‚Äúwow, that‚Äôs a lot of work for a simple habit change‚Äù. And you‚Äôre right, isn‚Äôt there a simpler way? Well, you‚Äôre in luck because there‚Äôs a very simple way. We talked about external stimulus in a negative way, but what if there‚Äôs an external stimulus in a positive way? What if my wife offered me a winning lottery ticket if I wrote during the day? What if during my writing process during the day I get fed the finest French cheese and wine? I‚Äôd be writing without question. And that is the power of excitement or hype, and while it can be triggered via an external stimulus the power to harness excitement is inside of you. And it‚Äôs all discussed in my anti-procrastination book [The Action Formula](https://www.amazon.com/Action-Formula-inside-action-procrastination/dp/B0CJBFP91V).

I didn‚Äôt intend for this but this writing also turned out to be a teaching piece. I taught you how to change your mind to change your behavior from the source of behavior. That‚Äôs a pretty abstract thing to teach but when you have the skill of teaching anyone anything, you too can write / talk / teach like this.

I‚Äôve had some issues over the last 3 or 4 months that have been frustrating, to say the least. It started with some swallowing issues that were diagnosed as muscle tension dysphagia. Something that happened simultaneously was a feeling of something in my right nostril after eating/drinking. A swallowing test shows nothing going up there, but the sensation would happen 70 percent out of the time after a meal.

For the last 4 weeks, that feeling is has turned into¬†**nasal burning**, with occasional throbbing in the right nasal region/right sinus area, with some tension headaches as well.¬† As well, that pain can be present on the right side of my throat, an inch above the collar bone.

Rarely it presents in the soft palate area on the right side. But, usually centered in the right nasal region. Some weeks are ok, but some weeks are much worse. It‚Äôs really hard for me to find a trigger on what makes it good or bad.

Like, as an example I was fine all day today. I had one decaf coffee at a cafe, which in the past has been fine, and suddenly I feel bad enough I had to go home.

**X-ray showed no infection**, steroid spray did nothing. My speech-language pathologist said LPR was a possibility but my GP sort of dismissed that possibility. My GP tried giving me gabapentin to see if it was nerve pain, with no change.¬†I see an allergist in 2 weeks and an ENT in 5 weeks.¬†That doesn‚Äôt seem long, but this burning nostril is really wearing me down.

I‚Äôm just curious if anyone has any thoughts, or other users have experienced something similar and if they had anything I could try in the meantime. Thanks!",1,1728010914.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Although a very big part of me is in the gray zone about my one mare. Dream Machine (JC: Streetherosdreamer) (barn name: Dolli)

(Pros of said mare)
. Reg 2010 Chestnut Mare (April 10th, 2010)-(papers in hand)
. Sired by Street Hero , by Miss Santa Anita - by IDE 
. Professional training & showing done by Boyd Martin 
. Showing history in the 3ft.6 - 3ft.9 jumper 
. Confident mare (maybe overly confident?)
. Clean bill of health (except some arthritis)
. Loves Doritos & Ice Coffee

(Cons of said mare)
. Mare is a not good with kids (hates them)  
. Mare is not the best with multiple disciplined (Mostly Jumpers, gets upset easily with Dressage or Hunter/Eq)
. More of a ‚Äústay if ur lane‚Äù only type
. Her job is her job & her job alone . She doesn‚Äôt like when rider tries to interfere with her (flat or over fences)
. Her way or the highway 
. Will usually bite or try to buck out , when her ‚Äòvibe‚Äô is messed with 


A part of me wants to lease her out after she is in TX for a month (maybe 2). Just because I feel like her & I are not in the same playing field right now.

The goal was for me to always show her & make her a 3 ringed horse (Hunter , EQ , & Jumper) , but right now she‚Äôs seem to just want to be a 1 ring horse(nothing wrong with that.) 

If anything I‚Äôm looking at if I don‚Äôt lease her out , she will sit in a field , driving her self nuts . She‚Äôs a type who needs to be in work & not just the same thing.  Although, I have thought about breeding her maybe (probs won‚Äôt do , but always an option) she did have a foal  (April 18 , 2014) - (Reg JC: Off The Rails) who happened to be a Bay Gelding sired by Silver Train . I don‚Äôt know what happened to him his last race was 8/4/18 at Penn National‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm looking at mostly showing my Percheron mare (Reg Name: A Pearls Annabels Dreamer) - (Barn name: Eclipse) in dressage this coming year, just because back in MD she had just started to show & she was doing well , I mean she loved it (on the flat at least) 

But I‚Äôm kinda afraid to lease out Dolli‚Ä¶.. like I mean I‚Äôve seen sooooo many horror stories of leases going wrong . Sometimes getting the horse back completely ruined (skinny, open wounds, lameness, even just sometimes so screwed up mentally, ect)


okay I‚Äôm scared of that (like literally) has anyone else felt like this? 


Like I feel like it would be more beneficial for her to be leased to someone , who goes fast & does the jumper , who can stay out of her way . To make her happy 

But like , I‚Äôve seen so many things go wrong with a lease that I don‚Äôt want to happen with this mare

1fvpepv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1fvpepv/we_often_hold_onto_destructive_habits_and_toxic/,"We often hold onto destructive habits and toxic relationships, even when we know they no longer serve us.","We all know, deep down, what's not quite right in our lives and where we need to make changes. Often, it's about breaking destructive habits or stepping away from toxic relationships. We feel regret and pain when we continue down paths that aren't good for us, but something keeps pulling us back. It's like we're caught in a loop‚Äîthe longer we stay in it, the deeper we go.

Because we're holding onto things that don't serve us‚Äîbe it habits or relationships‚Äîthey linger in our subconscious, draining the energy we need to grow and thrive. We're all here to grow, but many of us don't realize our full potential because we're stuck in this cycle.

Sometimes, we create stories in our minds to justify our actions. We tell ourselves there's a logical reason for our unhealthy habits or toxic relationships. But deep down, we know it's just an excuse. This self-deception is dangerous; it keeps us trapped, and before we know it, we've lost sight of what's real and what's not.

The amazing thing about the human brain is its neuroplasticity‚Äîthe ability to rewire itself. You can change your thought patterns and break free from what's holding you back. It takes effort, but it's possible. Most of what we do is automatic, driven by our subconscious. Think about how you learned to walk‚Äîyou practiced until it became second nature, and now you don't even think about it. The same goes for habits, both good and bad. They've become automatic, running in the background without us even realizing it. So much of what we do is on autopilot. Just like some people head straight to the coffee machine every morning because they've been doing it for decades.

The truth is, we all know where to begin when it comes to fixing our lives. The real challenge is overcoming the fear of change. We stay in our comfort zones, clinging to what we know, even if it's harming us. This is where the ego comes in. The ego craves comfort and runs from pain. It wants to avoid anything difficult, keeping us stuck. But once you realize that you are in control‚Äînot your ego‚Äîyou can start to shift things. There will always be a struggle between you and your ego, but the more conscious you become of it, the more power you'll have to change.

Without diving too deep into quantum physics, there's a concept called the Observer Effect, which suggests that simply observing something can change its behavior. This applies to your mind as well. By becoming aware of your thoughts‚Äîobserving them without judgment‚Äîyou can begin to change the way your mind works over time.

Start small. When you wake up, notice that voice in your head‚Äîthe one that tells you what to do, replays old memories, or makes you worry about the future. Don't judge it; just observe it. Notice the patterns and how they link to the habits that hold you back. As you become more aware, you'll start to break the cycle.

This is a huge topic, and there's so much more to explore. I didn't want to overwhelm you, but I hope this gives you a place to start. I'll keep reflecting on ways to dive deeper into this in the future.

I'm curious‚Äîwhat are some habits or thought patterns you'd like to change? Have you noticed any ""loops"" in your life that keep repeating? How might becoming more aware of your thoughts help you break free from them?

1fvp8jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fvp8jo/aitah_for_breaking_off_lifelong_friendships_over/,AITAH for breaking off lifelong friendships over a bizarre incident?,"I 63 yf recently returned from a girls trip with three lifelong friends, all same age.  Friendships which go back 48 and 58 years.

One morning I woke up and was reading in my room.  The other three women were talking on the other side of the wall.  

I heard my name clearly, the word ‚Äúmoney‚Äù several times.  The time was gossipy and cutting.  The ‚Äúmean girl ringleader‚Äù of the group was doing the gossiping.  I recently received an inheritance so my financial status has changed significantly.  

But I wasn‚Äôt too upset about that, it‚Äôs understandable (I guess) but not pleasant to hear.  Next I heard more clearly, complaints that I won‚Äôt travel without my husband, and then I heard her call a young close family member of mine a ‚Äúf‚Äî-ing bitch‚Äù

A few minutes later I went out there to get a cup of coffee and one of the friends (not mean girl) was in the kitchen.  I told her ‚Äúthese walls are thin and I heard some shit‚Äù she wanted to know what I heard and I told her.  She looked guilty, and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù in a very apologetic voice.  I told her I was disappointed in them.

After a long day in the vacation town, we went back to the VRBO to get ready to go out to dinner.  I had a pounding headache by this time and said I was staying in.  They left the house but came back ten minutes later.  This is where it gets weird.  

They burst into the room, mean girl first and started raising their voices, saying they never said anything behind my back and proceeded to deny everything in loud voices ‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúWE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT YOU!‚Äù  
THIS IS NOT TRUE!  Very aggressively, with mad looks on their faces.  

I said I told X this morning in the kitchen and she apologized, she said she was sorry!  She never denied it, she apologized!  

The room got silent and everyone looked at the kitchen friend.  She stammered and you could tell by her eyes darting that she was thinking.  She then proceeds to tell me that she ‚Äúonly meant she was sorry that I was upset, but not sorry for doing or saying anything wrong‚Äù

I sat up (head pounding even worse) and said you guys are all gaslighting me!  How dare you lie about an apology?  The denials got louder, raising voices again, until by this time I had tears in my eyes.  

Once they noticed the tears, the mean girl reached over and gives me this fake hug, stands up and says to me - okay get ready, we‚Äôre going to dinner now that this is solved. 

I was confused, hurt, angry and basically stunned.  I said my headache was worse and I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.  

The next day we left and nobody brought it up.  I texted with the mean girl once home again trying to use logic and discuss the situation as it went down.  I requested to know their conversation that they had so that I could see if any of the words sounded like what I heard, but maybe it was about someone else.  She said she didn‚Äôt remember, ‚Äúoh we were just all yapping‚Äù

She deflected, ignored direct questions, used vague word salad answers, and then began telling me the kitchen girl never apologized!  Even tho it was already discussed. 

By this time I‚Äôm done.  I am very sure I should let these lifelong friends go, as my self worth was disrespected and I believe this event was full of lies.  I mean people gossip, no big deal.  But the gaslighting was what did the worst damage.

I‚Äôve been working at an independent coffee shop for the past 15 months or so and it‚Äôs been a really supportive an intimate work environment. My coworkers are my friends, we take care of each other, we have relationships with our regular customers that go beyond the obligatory ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your day going‚Äù type of conversations. You get the idea. Yesterday, my first real day off in a while, I received a text from the general manager indicating that the cafe had been sold and that come Monday we would have new ownership. This came as a bit of a shock, to be sure. Our owners had been very hands off, as they owned the building we were located in, which included a few floors of apartments and other storefronts, and they were primarily landlords as opposed to entrepreneurs. The manager insisted on keeping a positive outlook. But in my heart I knew that this was a death knell. I learned that the new owners owned several other businesses in town including a chain of coffee shops that could best be described as ‚Äúgenerically third-wave.‚Äù Our entire identity had been built around being a cozy, unpretentious neighborhood place. It was clear to me that our new owners would make sweeping changes both to our aesthetic and to our business model. 
This afternoon, I received a text from one of my coworkers. ‚ÄúHave you seen the email the new owners sent?‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt. I checked my inbox and found a note from our usurpers. The tone of the email was generally belittling, and, among other slights, included this sentence which I will quote verbatim: ‚ÄúConsidering the short notice and timeline, we wanted to be able to offer a chance for any of you that might be interested in working with us to come and interview.‚Äù

I read that over and over again. The verbiage was so passive it gave the us media defending Israel‚Äôs war crimes a real run for its money. ‚ÄúWe wanted to be able‚Äù to ‚Äúoffer‚Äù a ‚Äúchance‚Äù to ‚Äúany of you‚Äù that ‚Äúmight‚Äù be ‚Äúinterested.‚Äù Are you fucking kidding me? I wanted to tell this guy to get fucked by the horse he rode in on. But I refrained. I could only despair. To make matters worse I had just been given a promotion and had been assured that if I stayed on for the next few months I‚Äôd be managing the shop solo with the full financial backing of the owners. Now, I‚Äôve been put into a position where I have to interview for a job that I already had. 
Ultimately I‚Äôm still in somewhat of a state of shock. If I can collect unemployment I think I will, but without any income I simply can‚Äôt afford to survive for more than a few weeks. Anyway. I just needed to vent about this. If this or something similar has happened to you I invite you to share your stories in the comments. Eat the rich and peace be with you.

Ello ello! My name is Lewis, I'm 29 and from the UK, more specifically the North West.

I'm on the search for someone like minded and just ""gets it"". I'm searching for that connection, that something which just makes you want to fall into things deeper.

I'm interested in getting to know each other on a deeper level, go on dates, have fun and just enjoy life! At this point where I am in my life, I just want to be happy with the person I choose to spend the rest of my life with.

I know what I want from a relationship and I'm not afraid to show it. Someone to be by each others sides through thick and thin, the good and the bad. Who understands you've got to weather the stormy seas to enjoy the good in life.

I work a crazy schedule so I'm available all hours of the day throughout the week.

I value trust and honesty above all else in a relationship. If I can't trust you, what's the point? I'd much rather be hurt than your brutal honesty than your lies and attempts to soften the blow. With that said, I'm not interested in wasting yours or my time. So I'll get it out of the way now that I have a 4 year old child from a previous relationship.

What I'm looking for in you:

A huge thank you to the beta testers who worked with our team to capture over 10,000 videos during the past 3 months to get this ready public release.

Automatic Video Capture uses the camera on your phone or tablet to capture a form video of every TechDisc throw and store it in the cloud along with the throw data so you can easily find it later. The app applies slo-mo at the release point (as measured by the TechDisc) so you get consistent-looking videos every time. Throw videos are also viewable on the web app. 

This is our first paid feature, requiring a $10 / month subscription, on a tier we're calling TechDisc Premium. We have lots more planned for this tier focused on training and improvement but our priority for the rest of 2024 will be on building Automatic Video Capture for Android and the web app. 

Grab a tripod, start that 7-day trial and let us know what you think. We'd love to see some shared videos from everyone and see who's turning the key and who's pouring the coffee!

I run lossless scaling frame gen on practically everything and I cannot tell that its enabled because of how good it works, I can go from 60 to 120 solid frames per second in one click, there are no strange shimmering or artifacts 95% of the time. only in the most rare cases do I ever notice a graphical shimmer. 

I am guessing those who are excited for AFMF2 have never heard of lossless scaling on steam at all? Or maybe its just that the tool is not that well known? I tested them both and lossless scaling still wins every single time. ",0,1728009112.0,radeon,7,0.25,False
1fvoy4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fvoy4n/aitah_for_not_being_a_good_friend/,AITAH for not being a good friend?,"So I recently got back in touch with an old friend. We were best friends for years and years, and then had a falling out (lets just say she became extremely negative and it was wearing on me, amongst her just not being a good friend anymore in general). A few years went by, and she had an immediate family member die. I reached out to her to send me condolences - first time we spoke in years. I decided to go to the funeral. I hadn't seen her or her family in 4 years. When I saw her, we just embraced and cried and all of these emotions came flooding in. I thought about it all day and really missed her. I realized how short life was and I missed our friendship and believed we probably both changed a lot in the last few years. Everything about our last argument just felt petty. Before I could reach out, she reached out to me first. She told me it was really nice seeing me, and wanted to know if I'd like to grab coffee. And so the following week, we did.

We talked for hours and it was really nice. I know that there was so many things about her that was new, as for me too, but I thought of it like a new friendship - not rekindling an old one. We continued to stay in touch, text, call, and have hung out a couple times since then (about a year). 

She doesn't seem to have much time to get together - everytime we try to make plans, she ends up canceling and blames it on me. ""We should probably cancel tonight.. I'm not feeling well, and I'd really hate for you to get what I have. Plus, I wouldn't be enjoyable company for you!"" Things like that. Okay, no problem. However, she has no problem texting me all day every day... doesn't try to get together, or even talk on the phone.. she will send me NOVELS via text. In my 20s, I guess I could text more, I had more time on my hands. I'm in my mid 30s now and I just can't be texting 24/7 anymore, life is busy. But she doesn't just text normal stuff. All her texts are HEAVY. She will send me a novel about her family member dying and how shes having such a hard time coming to terms with it. I have no idea how to help her with that, and even though I continue to tell her I'm so sorry and that I'm praying for her, I can't do much more. I told her it would be wise to see a therapist, and gave her my therapists info. She now sees my therapist. I thought that might help. It has not. She will still text me day in and out about her struggles in life.. her family member that passed, her grandmom aging, her boyfriend got bit by a dog, her back is hurting her, her job sucks, her coworkers are giving her a hard time.. you get the idea. And worst yet, if she's not throwing a pitty party, she is non stop talking about how in love she is with her boyfriend. She'll send me random pictures of the two of their hands together, or a selfie of them on the beach, ect. I'm like.. cool? I've been married for a while now, and I know that when we were dating, I didn't send any of that stuff to her, because who would really care? Tonight she sent me another long text telling me once again how grateful she is for just the most amazing boyfriend in the world. Then persisted to send a list of 'cute quotes' that he's said to her over the past year that she started keeping record of. 

I really don't know what to say to it all. I can only express sympathy for her troubles so many times. And I don't really know what else to say when she tells me how in love she is with her boyfriend, besides, 'cool.' 

For context, she was single when I was dating my husband at the time and she never expressed interest in my relationship, so I guess part of me never really forgot about that. An example of a time I can remember: When we got engaged, I was over the moon happy. She was one of the first people I called after he proposed and I was so excited to call her and tell her. Her first and only response was, 'Well, I guess it's just me left now.""

There is so much more I can add to this, but this is long as it is.

Legal both sides kahit parehas conservative ang parents namin, approved at suportado naman sila. 

Sa loob ng 6 years na yun, may times na puro happy lang, lalo na nung 1st year namin kasi first official relationship namin ang isa't isa. 

Never kami nag out of town na kami lang or magpalate ng sobrang gabi kasi we respect our parents kahit na gusto ko sya makasama ng matagal.

Noong nagkaroon na kami ng mga trabaho, mas busy talaga sya. Ako naman iniintindi ko yun kaya madalas, ako yung pumupunta at naghihintay sa kanya sa trabaho nya (after ng work ko) kahit gabi na out nya. Kakain kami ng mga ilang minuto tapos uwi na kasi pagod na sya at malayo pa uuwian nya (1 hr byahe) at kailangan kong intindihin yun kahit na gusto ko pa sya makasama. ""Intindihin mo sya"", lagi ko pinaaalalahanan sarili ko.

Wala naman akong nararamdaman na nagloloko sya. Talagang workaholic lang sya. May times na nagdedate naman kami mga once a week or after 2 weeks tapos matagal na yung 3 hours na coffee date (may kaunting beg pa ako sa kanya yun na maya maya na kami umuwi haha).

Pero nitong taon, simula na mag wfh ako, imbis na maging madalas pagkikita namin dahil I lived in the area kung saan din ang work nya, hindi pa rin kami nagkikita madalas. Kapag nag video call ako, minsan reject nya kasi antok na raw sya. Kaya madalas nagtatanong muna ako kung ""pwede vc?"" Yung pag vc ko sa kanya ay madalas tinatapos ko agad yung gawain ko para may time na ko sa kanya makipag usap. Pero nireremind ko sa sarili ko na ""intindihin mo sya. Pagod sya"". Kaso paano naman ako na nag e-effort din para makita at makausap lang sya.

Pag sinasabi ko yung nararamdaman ko sa kanya, nagpapasalamat daw sya sa understanding ko. Tapos babawi naman sya ng date at matagal na naman ang kasunod... then repeat.

Normal lang ba to? Or wala na tong  patutunguhan kasi paulit ulit na? I need your thoughts po kasi naiiyak ako madalas na parang ako na lang lagi nag eeffort sa amin pero kailangan ko syang intindihin kasi mahal namin ang isa't isa.

P.S. What I like about him ay yung pagiging matured, responsible, generous, and marespeto nya. Hindi ko naman isasantabi yun. I love him.

Year after year, more people are asking why they‚Äôre so tired, as modern life demands more mental effort, leading to fatigue.

Highlights
üß† Increased decision-making: Modern humans make around 35,000 decisions daily, leading to mental fatigue.
üåô Sleep challenges: Evolutionary mismatches affect our sleep patterns, contributing to tiredness.
‚òï Caffeine dependency: Caffeine blocks sleep signals, causing an afternoon crash when its effects wear off.
üí§ Importance of napping: Cultures that embrace afternoon naps report better cognitive functioning and health.
üö´ Information overload: Constant exposure to information adds to decision fatigue and stress.
üîÑ Chronotypes matter: Aligning daily schedules with natural sleep patterns can reduce fatigue.
üí° Glutamate buildup: Accumulation of glutamate from decision-making clogs brain function, causing tiredness.
Key Insights
üß© Complexity of modern life: Unlike our ancestors, we face complex decisions daily. This complexity strains our cognitive resources, leading to fatigue.
üå± Evolutionary mismatch: Our brains evolved for simpler times, but modern life requires us to adapt quickly, leading to mental exhaustion.
‚òÄÔ∏è The role of adenosine: Adenosine accumulates throughout the day, signaling tiredness. Caffeine interrupts this natural process, resulting in crashes.
üïí The power of coffee naps: Combining a short nap with caffeine intake can enhance energy and mental clarity, maximizing alertness.
‚öñÔ∏è Benefits of biphasic sleep: Cultures that incorporate naps often experience better health outcomes and mental performance compared to non-nappers.
üóÇÔ∏è Decision fatigue: The accumulation of decisions creates mental clutter, similar to trash piling up in a city, making further decision-making more challenging.
üîÑ Chronotype awareness: Understanding and aligning with your natural sleep preferences can optimize rest and reduce fatigue.",3,1728008801.0,indianews,0,0.8,False

I wonder what other quirks we have in common?

I sleep so much better and awake so refreshed and energetic if I go to sleep after drinking spirits. I used to drink straight vodka or gin strategically to feel perky for the morning of big events, like university exams. Otherwise I don‚Äôt sleep well and wake up exhausted.

Spirits don‚Äôt make me feel tipsy unless I drink a huge amount. Did it once, never again! I can have three or four shots without feeling it, and people think I‚Äôm sober. But even a little beer or bubbly makes me very tipsy very quickly, with an awful hangover the next day. I‚Äôm learning that it‚Äôs not an issue with carbonated alcohol but a histamine intolerance.

Another swapped reactions are that coffee relaxes me. If I am feeling anxious or my heart rate is high, I drink a double espresso. After it kicks in, my watch shows that my heart rate falls. (Not the case for milky coffees‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs the sugar?) I skip from relaxed to unpleasantly jittery if I have way, way too much caffeine.

1fvoqix,https://www.reddit.com/r/knives/comments/1fvoqix/benchmade_prices_are_just_fine/,Benchmade prices are just fine,"Benchmade makes some of the best knives in the world with exceptional craftsmanship, premium materials, and innovative design. The company treats and pays their employees well. Despite the good things about Benchmade knives, these days the newest trend seems to whine about Benchmade's prices. Though the things whiners moan about Benchmade varies, the general idea theme is that Benchmade knives are ""overpriced"" and ""not worth it"".

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with Benchmade‚Äôs prices IMO. If their knives are selling (and they are!), it means people see the value and are willing to pay for them. Prices are driven by supply, demand, and perceived worth. Like any luxury item, Benchmade knives are not meant for everyone's jeans pocket. And that is OK. They‚Äôre for those who appreciate quality and can afford it. Instead of complaining about what they secretly want, those who can‚Äôt afford a Benchmade should take it as motivation to save up.

People get outraged over a $240 Osborne, which breaks down to less than 70 cents a day over one year, yet they have no problem spending over $10 a day on bland deli sandwiches across the street from the office. It‚Äôs funny how priorities shift when it comes to convenience versus investing in something that lasts. They‚Äôll drop cash on overpriced lunches but complain about a knife that will serve them for years. I know a guy who goes to Starbucks every single morning ($6 coffee), complains about made in America knife prices, but doesn't seem to realize he is literally sipping away a Benchmade Bugout EVERY MONTH.

Overall, I think the whining about Benchmade‚Äôs prices is a mix of misplaced priorities, the expectation to get American quality at Chinese prices, and just plain jealousy. People happily drop cash on indulgences like overpriced lunches and $6 coffees, but get mad about investing in a quality, American-made knife that will them decades.

Here's some funny whiner quotes about Benchmade prices I've collected here on r/knives and r/knifeclub:

>""It's honestly embarrassing and disrespectful to the knife community in my opinion.""

As is customary, almost all of my friends brought housewarming gifts. As I do by the way when I attend a housewarming. My friends brought me nice gifts like some good bottles of wine, a very fine whiskey, some type of fancy style coffee beans, several people brought plants as I love plants, and one person even brought me a weird framed art thing with beans in it. 

So as you can see, I appreciate any housewarming gift, whether it is fancy or weird. It is the thought that is appreciated, the acknowledgment of friendship and custom. 

Imagine my astonishment when someone I thought was a friend arrived at my housewarming, to dine on my food and partake of my drinks, to be my honored guest, and brought NO gift. 

I asked them if their housewarming gift was still shipping, or if it was a card of some sort they had on them. They gave me a weird look. I asked again about the gift. 

This person told me they didn't bring me a gift! At first I thought they were joking. But they were serious. I asked again. They said they didn't bring me a gift and were sorry. By now everyone in the party was silent and staring at us. No doubt they were full of shock that someone was behaving so poorly. 

I just couldn't believe it. I demanded that they leave my housewarming party. They asked if I was serious. I said I'd never been more serious in my life and that they couldn't attend a housewarming if they weren't going to warm my house. In fact they were cooling my house if anything. With their frigid ambiance and lack of social graces. I told them if they ever wanted to correct their friendship they would bring me a housewarming gift accordingly. 

It really put a damper on the rest of the party, everyone was so dismayed I assume by the poor antics of my friend. At least I thought they were my friend.

Yet since the party I have heard from 2 people that they think I ""overreacted"" and was rude in my conduct. I was astonished to hear this. I think they must be wrong. Yet I thought I would ask reddit.",0,1728008278.0,AITAH,20,0.1,False

Elite Ranked Is About ...

- getting 1 percent for 3rd place

- getting stuck under 20 percent for two weeks because the higher-ranked players from last season are passing through to their normal ranks and are kicking you to sleep

- losing 5 percent for each time the client crashes

- losing 5 percent for spawning under the map

- losing 5 percent for instantly dying as the start timer finishes

- getting a track you have never seen before in the entire last season

- losing 5 percent for getting timed out because every single other racer HAS seen this track before

- losing 5 percent x3 for getting said map two more times in the same evening

- going back to the lobby on the third track appearance because it is going to be a 5 percent loss anyways and you might as well make some coffee that you can catch your tears in

- trying to drink salty coffee

- getting out of that miserable, horrible rank and finding champion feels far more honest and fun

- not finding a flair that matches my feelings for what I just went through. I guess Humor ... ?

Thank you for reading my tragic story. I feel a little better now.

What do I do? How do I get him back? ","I need advice on how to get my boyfriend of 8 years back. After years of resentment and unresolved issues, he started seeing someone else. Now I'm devastated and don‚Äôt know what to do.

\*\*\* Please only comment if you think you can provide helpful insights/tips. \*\*\*

**Background:**

For a long time, my boyfriend and I were holding grudges over small, unresolved issues. We would argue but never really address the root problems, and this led to resentment. Over time, we became passive-aggressive and distant. We got stuck in a cycle where neither of us wanted to change unless the other made the first move, which only deepened the problems. Looking back, I realize it was a bunch of small, unrelated incidents that built up because we didn't communicate properly.

I was always mad at him but don't know why, now I have done this reflection and see I was always mad, I feel so horrible.

**The Breaking Point:**

About 6 months ago, after a series of fights (that I don't remember the reasons of), I started ignoring him and even went on a few dates with other people (nothing serious). At the same time, I was also going through a stressful pageant competition, and I didn't have the energy to fix things. He tried to reach out, but I wasn‚Äôt responsive. My unresponsiveness peeked 2 months ago, I just finished my competition and I was going through some serious burnout. Then, about four weeks ago, he started talking to a girl on a dating app who had just been dumped by her fianc√©. He flew to meet her in New York, and they spent a week together.

\*\* Timeline \*\* I stopped talking to him 2 months ago after my pageant mid-Aug.

He started messaging this girl on dating apps 4 weeks ago, they've been talking for 2 weeks online, and he flew to NY to see her in person, and that was 2 weeks ago.

Her fiance left her 5 weeks ago when they were ring shopping, she started talking to my bf a week after

**He's View:**  
Now he‚Äôs told me that he thinks she‚Äôs ""the one."" He has introduced her to his parents, set up a joint bank account, and planned 4 international trips together. He says they are very compatible, while our relationship was based on physical attraction.

He think one of the big reason why he no longer wants to be with me is because of our ""baggages"", we had some pretty dramatic bad things happened in the first 2 years of our relationship, I think he doesn't even realize the baggage he is talking about is not a specific event anymore, it's the unresolved grievances between us.

Because of the resentment I had, I wasn't the best girlfriend to him for the past 2 years. I was a great girlfriend before, but I don't think he remembers it anymore, I used to hand sew holes on he's socks, I did all the cooking, cleaning, I always come downstairs to the street to greet him when he comes home, either it's during the day or I am already in bed. I loves him deeply, and I just lost sights in the past 2 years, doesn't this happen to every relationship? I realize what I have done now, and I just want him back.

***\*\* He listed a few things he doesn't like abt me: \*\****

*- I always drink coffee in he's uber, and he is concerned about he's uber ratings*

*- I don't like he's friends and act dismissive around them. (a few of them have done disrespectful things like calling call girls when i was still there, saying nasty sexual jokes to me, or a serial cheater that my best friend got affected. But he's argument is if I love him, I will accept he's friends. Those friends also is a bad influence on him, when they are around, he likes to party till 8am every weekend & do blows)*

***\*\* he listed a few things he likes about the new girl \*\****

*- she made a sign to pick him up at the airport when he arrived*

*- she don't fight with him about things*

*- they have no baggages.*

**How I'm Feeling:**

I am completely devastated. It hurts so much I started to cut myself. I can't eat, can't sleep, and I've lost 8 pounds in a week. I never realized how much he meant to me until I lost him. He was my anchor, I grew up without a father, he is my first male figure in life. Now, I feel lost and don't know how to move on. We had a somewhat codependent relationship, and I can‚Äôt imagine life without him.

Even though he has many flaws, but no one is perfect. I accept him for who he is, and I just want to be loyal, sweet, and love him for the rest of my life.

**Where Things Stand Now:**

He told me not to message him anymore, but he hasn't blocked me. Since they are both out of a LTR, he‚Äôs made a promise to his new girlfriend not to see me, just like she promised not to go back to her ex-fianc√©. Our 8th anniversary is in less than 3 months, and I refuse to accept this outcome.

How can I get him back? He seems to be very disappointed at me for the things I've done, he think I am not a sweet person because if I do care about him I won't fight with him on those small things. I now think he is right.

Also we had huge communication issues before, none of us were introspective enough at the time to see it, but I do now. If we are back together again, I know how to make things better.

\*\*\* Please only comment if you think you can provide helpful insights/tips. \*\*\*

\*\* to address some common thing mentioned in the comment \*\*

* I know I sound very immature, but this relationship is incredibly complicated, we have been through a lot together. Even though he said he has moved on, but it's also only been a month, I want to do everything I can to get him back.
* I went on dates, yes, I cheated (never slept with anyone, dinners). I have issues with wanting to find someone to complete me, and I am working with someone on it. But this is not about me cheating, we had a huge issue with cheating in the first two years, we both have done things we are not proud of, but we have worked through that. He left because I was ignoring him and always picking fights with him the past two years.
* It's unhealthy, I know. But this poison is my medicine. ",0,1728008202.0,relationship_advice,58,0.27,False

1fvon3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/copilotmoney/comments/1fvon3j/how_to_budget_savings_investments/,How to budget savings & investments,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been a big fan of Ramit Sethi‚Äôs Conscious Spending Plan (CSP) and am trying to format my budget to align with his principles. I‚Äôve been using the Copilot app to manage everything, and I wanted to share my experience so far in hopes of getting some suggestions on optimizing it.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working with:

I‚Äôve divided my budget into four main groups to follow the CSP breakdown:

	‚Ä¢	Fixed Costs (50-60%)
	‚Ä¢	Investments (10%)
	‚Ä¢	Savings Goals (5-10%)
	‚Ä¢	Guilt-Free Spending (20-30%)

My challenge has been tracking savings contributions (like for my Emergency Fund or my trip to Italy next year). Since that money isn‚Äôt actually spent yet, I want to exclude it from my spending totals to avoid inflating my numbers. However, when I eventually spend on the Italy trip, I want those expenses to reflect in my travel category for accurate tracking.

Right now, I‚Äôve organized my categories like this:

Fixed Costs:

	‚Ä¢	Rent, groceries, utilities, car payments, gas, etc.

Guilt-Free Spending:

	‚Ä¢	Coffee, restaurants, personal care, etc.

Savings Goals:

	‚Ä¢	Emergency Fund, Italy Trip

Investments:

	‚Ä¢	Roth IRA, HSA

When I categorize savings contributions as transfers or exclude them, I can‚Äôt budget for them, and the analytics get messy. When I spend on travel, I don‚Äôt want to count both the savings contributions and the actual spending, but I still want to track the travel expenses properly.

Has anyone else run into this issue or found a workaround? It‚Äôs be cool if Copilot allowed setting budgets for excluded categories, but in the meantime, I‚Äôd love any suggestions on how to manage this more efficiently.

Before I left, I asked my manager if it was okay to take them, and she said I would need to put them in the lost and found behind CS and wait 30 days to see if the customer returns, because it could be flagged by LP (Loss Prevention).
