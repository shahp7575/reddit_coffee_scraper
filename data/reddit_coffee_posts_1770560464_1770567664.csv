* a sofa (2 person)
* a footstool (room too small for a chaise longue sofa IMO)
* a TV
* **MAYBE** some table for guests... **BUT** in the **future**.

Theoretically I COULD move the bed to another room but this is a HUGE change for me. I'd much rpefer to keep the bed in this room (noisy neighbours).

**1.** I don't know what I'm doing, please share your suggestions to make this room look and feel good!  
**2.** Can we future proof this so I can squeeze in a coffee table/dining table for 2-3 persons if needed?

I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself, sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

The Vibe: Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

**TL;DR:** Childfree, progressive, experimental and insatiably curious?

Same mistakes everywhere. Here's what's actually costing you:

**1. Checkout is the silent killer**

Indian D2C cart abandonment: 70-80%

What I see repeatedly:

* Forced account creation vs guest checkout = **30% drop in completions**
* Every extra form field = **2-5% abandonment**
* Broken mobile checkout = **losing 60% of traffic**

Real example: Mattress brand. Went from 6-step to 3-step checkout, fixed mobile UX. **23% conversion lift in 2 weeks.**

**2. Analytics blindness**

95% of brands I've looked at:

* GA4 set up incorrectly (or not at all)
* No funnel visualization
* Zero idea where drop-offs happen
* Guessing which channels work

You're optimizing in the dark.

**3. Product pages that don't convert**

Common issues:

* Generic copy that could be anyone's brand
* No social proof above the fold
* Zero urgency elements
* Doesn't answer ""why THIS vs competitors?""

Your PDP should sell, not just describe.

**4. Leaving money on the table post-purchase**

Underused opportunities:

* No checkout upsells
* No post-purchase offers
* No proper abandoned cart flows
* No subscriptions on consumables

Coffee brand example: Added strategic upsells. **18% AOV increase on same traffic.**

**5. Site speed massacre**

Google: 53% of mobile users bail if load > 3 seconds.

Most D2C sites I check: **6-8 second load times.**

Half your paid traffic gone before seeing your homepage.



**The brutal truth:** These aren't advanced tactics. They're fundamentals everyone skips while chasing growth hacks.

I've watched great products lose to mediocre brands with optimized funnels.

I sleep for about 10 hours a night (sometimes I’ve slept for 12 hours while being on the same meds I am now). I usually sleep through the night, sometimes I wake up around the 8 hour mark and then I fall back asleep. I’ve been noticing really bad energy/mood drops around 1-2pm, which I think is around my meds wearing off (I take them around 5:30am).

I notice that when I don’t take my Concerta, I’m really sleepy and unmotivated. I know when I was on Strattera, I would take multiple naps during the day and I was just exhausted and depressed (I was put on it despite telling them SSRIs/SNRIs are a bad med for my bipolar). 

I take 54mg Concerta in the mornings with a cup of coffee, and that is like the perfect mix for me. After I’ve worked out, I feel focused and calm.

  
I honestly don’t have much of a social life because I’m asleep by 7pm, and I’m just miserable and overstimulated and unmotivated when that afternoon slump hits. When my fatigue hits in the afternoons, I can’t manage to nap, which really sucks. I can’t fall asleep until I’ve taken my Latuda and sometimes melatonin.

1qzcubm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pppdizziness/comments/1qzcubm/mitolyn_reviews_and_complaints_an_honest_customer/,Mitolyn Reviews and ComplaintS:~ An Honest Customer 2026 Review!,"So I've been seeing Mitolyn absolutely everywhere lately - Instagram ads, YouTube sponsors, even my aunt mentioned it at Thanksgiving. After months of scrolling past it, I finally caved and decided to try it myself. Now that I'm three months in, I figured it's time to share my actual experience because honestly, most reviews out there feel super fake or like they're just trying to sell you something.

# What Even Is Mitolyn?

Before I get into my experience, let me break down what this stuff actually is. Mitolyn is basically a dietary supplement that's supposed to support your metabolism and mitochondrial function. If you're like me and slept through high school biology, mitochondria are those things we all memorized as ""the powerhouse of the cell."" Turns out they actually do matter when it comes to energy production and how your body processes food.

The whole pitch behind Mitolyn is that it helps optimize these little cellular powerhouses, which theoretically should help with energy levels, weight management, and overall metabolic health. It comes in capsule form, and you're supposed to take it daily with meals.

# Why I Actually Decided To Try It

I'm gonna be real with you - I've tried a LOT of supplements over the years. Most of them ended up sitting in my cabinet half-empty because I either didn't notice any difference or they made me feel weird. But I was in this rut where I constantly felt sluggish, especially in the afternoons, and no amount of coffee was helping. I'm in my mid-30s now, and I swear my metabolism just decided to peace out sometime after 32.

I wasn't looking for some miracle weight loss thing or anything like that. I just wanted to feel like myself again - to have enough energy to actually want to go to the gym after work instead of melting into my couch. A friend of mine who's really into health stuff mentioned she'd been taking Mitolyn for a few months and felt like it helped, so I figured why not give it a shot.

# First Impressions and Week One

The packaging is pretty straightforward - nothing too fancy, just a regular supplement bottle. Each capsule is a decent size but not so huge that you feel like you're swallowing a horse pill. The instructions say to take two capsules daily with food, preferably in the morning.

I'm not gonna lie, the first week I didn't feel much of anything. I wasn't expecting immediate results, but part of me was still hoping I'd wake up on day two with crazy energy or something. That's not how it works though, and I think that's where a lot of people get disappointed with supplements - they expect overnight transformations.

The only thing I noticed initially was that I didn't get any weird side effects. No jitters, no stomach issues, no headaches. For me, that was actually a good sign because I've had supplements in the past that made me feel anxious or gave me digestive problems.

# Weeks 2-4: Starting To Notice Changes

Around the second week, I started noticing something subtle. That 2pm crash I usually experienced wasn't hitting as hard. I work a desk job, and normally by mid-afternoon I'm struggling to keep my eyes open, reaching for my third coffee and contemplating a nap under my desk. But I realized I was getting through my afternoons without that desperate need for caffeine or sugar.

It wasn't like I suddenly had boundless energy or anything dramatic. It was more like... I just felt steadier throughout the day? Like my energy levels weren't doing these crazy peaks and valleys anymore. I was sleeping better too, which I hadn't expected. I fell asleep easier and wasn't waking up multiple times during the night like I usually do.

By week three, I actually wanted to work out. This might not sound like a big deal, but for me it was huge. I'd been paying for a gym membership that I barely used because I was always too tired after work. But I started going to the gym three times a week, and I didn't feel like I was dragging myself there. I actually had the energy to do it.

# The Two Month Mark

This is where things got interesting. I wasn't trying to lose weight specifically, but I definitely noticed my clothes fitting better. I lost about 6 pounds without really changing my diet that much - though to be fair, I was working out more consistently, so that probably contributed.

What really stood out to me was my mental clarity. I work in marketing and I'm constantly juggling multiple projects, and I noticed I was getting through my work faster and making fewer stupid mistakes. Brain fog had been such a normal part of my life that I didn't even realize how much it was affecting me until it started lifting.

My morning routine also got easier. I used to hit snooze like five times and stumble around like a zombie for the first hour. Now I was actually waking up when my alarm went off and feeling relatively human right away. Small thing, but it made my mornings so much less stressful.

# Month Three: The Current Status

So here I am, 90 days in, and I'm honestly planning to keep taking it. The results have been subtle but consistent. I'm down about 9 pounds total, I have way more energy, and I just feel better overall. My workouts have gotten better too - I can push harder and recover faster.

I also noticed my appetite is more regulated. I used to get these intense hunger pangs and cravings, especially for sugar in the afternoon. Those have pretty much disappeared. I still enjoy food and eat normally, but I'm not getting those desperate ""I need to eat RIGHT NOW"" feelings anymore.

# The Not-So-Great Parts

Okay, so it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Here's what I didn't love:

**The price** \- It's definitely not the cheapest supplement out there. I'm spending about $60 per bottle, and each bottle lasts about a month. That's not terrible compared to some supplements, but it adds up.

**You have to be consistent** \- If I forget to take it for a few days, I notice the difference. That afternoon slump comes back, and I feel more sluggish. So you really need to make it part of your daily routine.

**Results take time** \- If you're looking for quick fixes, this isn't it. It took a solid few weeks before I noticed anything, and the benefits built gradually over time.

**It's not magic** \- This might be obvious, but Mitolyn isn't going to fix a terrible diet or make up for no exercise and zero sleep. It's a supplement, which means it's supposed to supplement an already decent lifestyle, not replace healthy habits.

# Who I Think Would Actually Benefit

Based on my experience, I think Mitolyn could be helpful if you're:

* Dealing with that constant tired feeling even when you're getting enough sleep
* In your 30s or beyond and noticing your metabolism isn't what it used to be
* Struggling with afternoon energy crashes
* Looking to support your overall metabolic health
* Willing to give it at least a month or two to see results

I don't think it's necessary if you're already feeling great, have tons of energy, and your metabolism is working fine. Like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, you know?

# My Actual Recommendation

Here's my honest take: Mitolyn worked for me, but that doesn't mean it'll work the same for everyone. Bodies are weird and everyone responds differently to supplements. What I can say is that it's been worth the money for me personally, and I'm going to keep taking it.

If you're on the fence, I'd suggest trying it for at least two months. One month might not be enough to really see the benefits since they build gradually. And obviously, if you have any health conditions or take other medications, talk to your doctor first. I'm just some random person on Reddit, not a medical professional.

The biggest thing for me was managing my expectations. I wasn't looking for dramatic weight loss or some total life transformation. I just wanted to feel better and have more energy, and on that front, it delivered. The weight loss and improved fitness were nice bonuses.

# Final Thoughts

Look, I get being skeptical about supplements. Most of them are overhyped garbage that doesn't do anything except make your pee expensive. But Mitolyn has been one of the few that actually made a noticeable difference for me. It's not going to change your life overnight, but if you're struggling with low energy and metabolic issues like I was, it might be worth a shot.

Would I recommend it? Yeah, cautiously. Try it for a couple months, pay attention to how you feel, and see if it works for you. Keep your receipt in case it doesn't. And seriously, don't expect miracles - expect gradual improvements that build over time.",1,1770566916.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False
1qzctfa,https://i.redd.it/wa0jb2r3oaig1.png,Vultr Free Trial ✅ Get $300 Free Cloud Hosting Credit (2026),"Let me be honest with you for a moment.

Most people don’t **choose** cloud hosting.  
 They end up there because shared hosting gets slow, crashes during traffic spikes, or simply can’t keep up anymore.

That’s exactly where I was when I first searched for a **Vultr free trial**.

I didn’t want buzzwords.  
 I didn’t want “enterprise-grade” fluff.  
 I wanted one simple thing:

👉 **Can this hosting actually handle real websites without wasting my money?**

That’s where **Vultr** surprised me.

Instead of locking me into a stripped-down demo, Vultr gave me **real cloud credit**—first $250, and later I discovered a **$300 free credit offer** through promotions and referrals. No gimmicks. No fake limits. Just… real servers.

This isn’t a technical review written by someone who’s never paid a hosting bill.  
 This is a **copywriting-style, human-written, first-hand experience** meant to help you decide whether Vultr is worth your time—and your money.

So grab a coffee.  
 Let’s talk like humans.

**Vultr Free Trial Explained (No Confusion, No Hype)**

Right now, Vultr offers **two legitimate free trial credits** for new users:

# 🔹 Vultr $250 Free Trial

This is the **standard offer** most new users see when signing up directly.

# 🔹 Vultr $300 Free Trial

This higher credit usually comes from **special promotions or referral links**.

Here’s the important part (don’t miss this):

➡️ **Both trials work exactly the same.**  
 ➡️ The **only difference is how much free credit you get.**

Same servers.  
 Same performance.  
 Same dashboard.

More credit simply means **more room to test**.

# What Makes Vultr’s Free Trial Different (And Better)

Most “free trials” are useless.

You get:

* A tiny server  
* Locked features  
* Not enough time to test anything  

Vultr doesn’t do that.

With $250 or $300 in free credit, you can:

* Launch multiple servers  
* Test different CPU/RAM combinations  
* Try NVMe SSD performance  
* Deploy in multiple locations  
* Run your site long enough to actually *see* results  

That’s the difference between a **trial** and a **demo**.





# My First-Hand Vultr Experience

# I didn’t treat this like a sandbox.

#  I treated it like a real project.

# Step 1: Signup & Verification

* Email verification: instant  
* Card added: small authorization hold (normal)  
* Free credit appeared immediately  

No sales calls.  
 No pushy emails.  
 No surprises.

# Step 2: Server Deployment

I deployed:

* One standard Cloud Compute server  
* One High Frequency NVMe server  
* A WordPress site  
* A staging environment  

This wasn’t “testing for testing’s sake.”  
 This was **real usage**.

**The Vultr Dashboard (Why Beginners Actually Like It)**

If you’ve ever opened AWS for the first time, you know the feeling.

Confusing menus.  
 Hundreds of options.  
 No idea where to click.

Vultr feels different.

* Servers deploy in under 60 seconds  
* Pricing is visible before you click “Deploy”  
* Usage is easy to understand  
* Destroying a server is one click  

It doesn’t insult beginners—but it doesn’t limit advanced users either.

That balance matters more than people realize.

**Performance That You Can Actually Feel**

This is the part people care about most.

# Standard Cloud Compute

* Stable  
* Predictable  
* Perfect for blogs and smaller sites  

# High Frequency Compute (NVMe SSD)

This is where Vultr shines.

I noticed:

* Faster page loads  
* Snappier WordPress admin  
* Database queries finishing quicker  
* No lag during traffic spikes  

This wasn’t “benchmark numbers.”  
 This was **real, noticeable speed**.

**Vultr Free Trial for WordPress (Why People Switch and Never Look Back)**

If you run WordPress, Vultr is a huge upgrade from shared hosting.

Here’s why:

* No overcrowded servers  
* Dedicated resources  
* NVMe SSDs improve database speed  
* Traffic spikes don’t break your site  

Using Vultr’s WordPress image, setup took minutes.  
 No command-line stress. No guesswork.

The result?

A site that finally feels **in control**.

**Global Data Centers = Real SEO Benefits**

Vultr has data centers in:

* North America  
* Europe  
* Asia  
* Australia  

This matters because:

* Server location affects load time  
* Load time affects user experience  
* User experience affects SEO and conversions  

During the free trial, I tested two regions.  
 Latency differences were obvious.

That’s not theory—that’s physics.

**Vultr for Developers (Power Without Headaches)**

Developers love Vultr for one simple reason:

👉 It stays out of the way.

* Clean API  
* Fast provisioning  
* Easy automation  
* Predictable pricing  

During the trial, I created and destroyed servers freely—without fear of surprise charges.

That freedom is rare.

**Vultr Free Trial for Startups & SaaS Projects**

If you’re building something new, the Vultr free trial is gold.

You can:

* Validate infrastructure choices  
* Estimate real monthly costs  
* Test scaling  
* Avoid over-engineering early  

The **$300 free credit** is especially useful here.

Startups don’t need “enterprise contracts.”  
 They need **clarity**.

**How Much Is $250 or $300 Really Worth?**

Let’s make this practical.

* Small server → runs for months  
* Medium server → runs for weeks  
* Multiple servers → side-by-side comparisons  

Most people decide **long before the credit runs out**.

That’s how you know it’s enough.

**Common Mistakes That Burn Free Credit (Avoid These)**

Let me save you from pain.

# ❌ Stopping servers instead of destroying them

Stopped servers still cost money. Destroy unused ones.

# ❌ Forgetting snapshots

Snapshots are useful—but billable.

# ❌ Deploying everything at once

Start small. Scale intentionally.

# ✔️ Check billing daily

Vultr makes this easy—use it.

**Vultr vs Other Cloud Free Trials (Real Talk)**

**Vultr vs AWS**  
 AWS is powerful but overwhelming. Vultr is practical.

**Vultr vs Google Cloud**  
 Big credits, steep learning curve.

**Vultr vs DigitalOcean**  
 Beginner-friendly, but Vultr offers stronger performance options.

Vultr hits the sweet spot between **power and simplicity**.

**Pricing After the Free Trial (No Scary Surprises)**

When your free credit runs out:

* Pay-as-you-go billing  
* Hourly pricing  
* No contracts  
* Clear invoices  

You stay because it works—not because you’re locked in.

**Is Vultr Worth Paying For?**

Here’s my honest answer:

If you care about:

* Speed  
* Control  
* Transparency  

Then yes—Vultr is worth it.

Not because it’s flashy.  
 Because it **does the job well**.

**Frequently Asked Questions (Real Answers)**

# Can I choose $250 or $300 credit?

It depends on the promotion you sign up through.

# Will I be charged automatically?

Only if you exceed your free credit.

# Is Vultr beginner-friendly?

Yes—much easier than AWS.

# Can I host WordPress?

Absolutely. It’s one of Vultr’s best use cases.

# Is this free forever?

No. It’s a free trial with real value.

**Final Thoughts (Why This Free Trial Exists)**

Vultr doesn’t give away $250–$300 for charity.

They do it because:

* People test it  
* People see the performance  
* People stay  

That confidence says more than any ad ever could.

**Ready to Try Vultr?**

If you’re tired of guessing and want real proof:

👉 **Claim your Vultr free trial and get $250 or $300 in cloud credit today.**

No contracts.  
 No pressure.  
 Just real hosting—tested by you.

Despite my almost entire inability to make sentences, I understood way more than I expected. People were kind and helpful and I did have a few great moments. And plenty of frustration too.

Long version:

*(about me: level 2, essentially started from zero in fall 2025. Not a CI purist but I'm trying to be as CI-focused as possible. Right now I'm mostly using French Comprehensible Input A2/B1/B2 playlists and the early InnerFrench podcasts, with many other things sprinkled in. Please don't suggest other for-pay ""Immersion"" sites in the comments;  I know they exist and I don't need any product placements, thanks!)*

So, I was in Brussels for a work conference and took the next week off to visit France, to escape the cold/snow of Berlin.

Before I started the trip I ""cheated"" and listened to some of the free ""Language Transfer"" (LT) Intro to French podcasts, because I found LT helpful when I was dabbling in Spanish a few years ago. LT is the polar opposite of comprehensible input: it uses a ""thinking method"" where you start by talking and producing sentences from the very first minutes. I thought it would be useful to be able to say basic things like ""I would like to order a coffee/beer please"". While this worked, I can now confirm that the LT French podcast is \*excruciatingly bad\* after trying an input-based method. The student being recorded has a horrible accent, doesn't pay attention, and is constantly making mistakes. I don't recommend it at all. BUT, I can now order a coffee easily, so it was still kinda useful in my circumstance. 

In Brussels everyone speaks English, so while I said a few French words here and there, it was not really an immersion experience.

Then my next stop was Lille, in the very far north of France. This was very different. My feeble attempts at French were met with... FRENCH! This never happens in Berlin where Germans immediately switch to English if they hear you struggling. I had some lovely (but extremely brief) interactions with the usual tourist-adjacent things: cafe staff, people in bars, ticket sellers etc. I was able to understand a bit of what people said back to me through context and a fair number of common words that I recognized from input. 

Real conversations are obviously completely out of the question at this stage: I'm talking about simple transactions. Where are you from? Do you want a drink with that? One more please. There was one waitstaff in a cafe who was very unable to help me: she didn't speak any English, and just kept repeating the thing I didn't understand a few times. Ahahaha I'm back in SuperBeginner! just kidding ;-) But she wasn't mean about it: I think she just didn't have experience trying to make something comprehensible to a beginner. (It became apparent after my cold tartelette arrived, that she was trying to tell me that their oven was broken and she couldn't warm it up. I kept hearing the word ""chaud"" and I kept saying ""oui, chaud! Merci."" I'm certain she wanted to punch me in the face...)

Next stop was Montpellier, on the southern Mediterranean coast. I was visiting a good friend whose relatives live nearby in Sète. They are OLD (like, 80 and 85 old) and definitely don't speak English. The dad barked a few English words at me ""TRUMP!"" ""FOOTBALL!"" and we basically ignored each other. The mom was wonderful and spoke slowly and asked questions and was genuinely happy that I was making a feeble effort. There was a magical moment when I was trying to say ""enough"" as in, no more (drinks) please, and I said ""assez"" and she pulled out a FRIGGIN' CHALKBOARD!! from her kitchen drawer and explained to me that ""suffisent"" is the right word to use, not ""assez"" because assez means like ""enough already!"" as if you're a bit annoyed, while suffisent is simply ""that's enough thanks"". And she fixed my pronunciation because the second ""s"" is more of ""z"" sound. I will never forget this word!!

I don't know if this is an established 'thing' or not, but I found the southern accent easier to comprehend than the north. It felt like they were pronouncing more of the silent letters, which was helpful. 

As you can probably tell, I am happy with how it all went 😍 and this must be part of the ""Dunning-Kruger"" effect where I had an early big achievement and will soon fall into the valley of despair once I realize how much farther I still have to go...

Thank you Dreaming French so much, for getting me started on this journey and thank you YouTube, FCI, InnerFrench and all those other resources for getting me out of SuperBeginner and into Beginner!!

And, I'll go back this summer, hopefully with 300 hours under my belt.

I was waiting in line during a busy morning rush. Everyone was tired, quiet, and clearly just trying to get caffeine and move on.

The person behind me kept standing way too close. Like close enough that I could feel them breathing near my shoulder. I took a small step forward. They stepped closer. I turned slightly and politely said, hey, do you mind giving me a little space? They scoffed and said relax, it’s a line. That already rubbed me the wrong way, but I let it go.

A minute later, they bumped into me again and said maybe if you moved faster this wouldn’t happen. That’s when I stopped being polite. I turned around and said maybe if you respected personal space, this wouldn’t be an issue. They rolled their eyes and said wow, someone’s sensitive. So I matched their tone and said yeah, and someone’s rude.

Other people in line definitely heard it. Someone behind them snorted. The barista looked over. The person got angry and said I didn’t need to escalate things and that I was being aggressive. That annoyed me, because I matched their exact energy. Nothing more.

Afterward, a friend I told the story to said I should’ve just stayed polite and let it go. They said being rude back makes me just as bad. I don’t agree.

1qzcpnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/buhaydigital/comments/1qzcpnv/payo_para_sa_mga_kabataan_na_gusto_pumasok_sa/,Payo para sa mga kabataan na gusto pumasok sa freelance/contract life,"Guys gumamit ako ng AI para ireformat ang thoughts ko, hindi ko ito kinakahiya okay

Mga kuya/ate vibes lang 'to. Hindi ako nagpapanggap na expert, pero ito yung mga natutunan ko sa freelance/contract world na sana sinabi sa akin nung nagsisimula pa lang ako.

**1. Magbayad ka ng tax kahit masakit sa bulsa sa una.**

Oo, alam ko. Yung iba hindi naman dinedeclare lahat. Parang business din 'to — may expenses ka, may deductions ka. Pero ang point ay mag-file ka. Bakit? Kasi magagamit mo 'yan sa mga bagay na kailangan mo in the future — loans, house, car, travel visa. Pag wala kang ITR or tax records, mahihirapan ka mag-prove ng income. Yung ilang oras mo sa pag-aayos ng BIR papers mo ngayon, makakatipid ka ng ilang buwan na headache mamaya.

**2. Wag makipag-compete sa iba. Sarili mo lang kalaban mo dito.**

Madaling ma-insecure sa freelance world. ""Si ganito kumukuha na ng ganyang rate,"" ""si ganyan ang dami nang clients."" Wag mo pansinin. Iba-iba tayo ng pace, ng niche, ng starting point. Ang focus mo lang: mas magaling ka ba ngayon kesa last month? 'Yun lang. Upgrade your skills consistently. Lagi.

**3. Libre ang mentorship at training — samantalahin mo.**

Isa sa pinaka underrated na bagay sa freelance/contract world: ang dami ng libre. YouTube, free courses, communities, Discord servers, open-source projects. At maraming senior freelancers willing mag-mentor basta humble ka lumapit. 'Wag kang mahiya magtanong. Mas nakakahiya yung 3 years ka na sa industry, same skills pa rin.

**4. Sa simula, worth it ang multiple clients/jobs — pero may expiration date 'yan.**

Syempre, sino ba naman may ayaw ng maraming pera? Hustle ka habang kaya mo. Pero 'wag mo i-sacrifice lahat ng oras mo sa pagchachase ng next client. Ipundar mo yung ibang oras mo sa pagpapagaling at pagpapalawak ng skills mo. Bakit? Kasi doon tataas ang rate mo. Yung iba, 1 client lang, di pa nag-wo-work ng 8 hours, pero mas malaki pa kita kesa sa may tatlong work na laging puyat. That's the endgame.

**5. Mag-invest sa equipment mo.**

Kahit anong argumento pa sabihin ng iba — ""hindi naman sa gamit 'yan, nasa skills 'yan"" — half-truth lang 'yan. Pag mas maganda at mabilis ang equipment mo, mas maganda ang output mo, mas mabilis ka mag-deliver, mas marami kang nagagawa sa isang araw. Ang bilis ng tech mag-advance. 'Wag ka mag-settle sa laggy na laptop na nag-crash every 2 hours. Treat it as a business investment, hindi luho.

**6. Matuto kang mag-negotiate. Hindi fixed ang presyo mo.**

Maraming bagong freelancer tinatanggap na lang kung ano yung una nilang ma-offer. 'Wag ganon. Alamin mo yung market rate, alamin mo yung value ng ginagawa mo, at matuto kang mag-counter offer nang professional. Kahit ma-reject, iba yung dating mo pag alam mong worth mo. At pag tumagal ka, lahat ng client mo ngayon magiging reference mo bukas — so deliver ka ng maayos, then charge what you're worth.

**7. Build your portfolio kahit walang client.**

Wala pang client? Gawa ka ng mock projects. Redesign mo yung website ng favorite coffee shop mo. Gawa ka ng sample app. Write sample articles. Yung portfolio mo ang nagbebenta sa'yo, hindi yung resume mo. Sa freelance world, ""show don't tell"" talaga. Walang mag-hire sa'yo base sa sinabi mo — gusto nila makita.

**8. Mag-set ka ng boundaries. 'Wag maging 24/7 available.**

Isa sa pinakamalaking trap ng freelance: kasi ikaw ang sarili mong boss, feeling mo kailangan mo laging naka-on. Hindi sustainable 'yan. Set ka ng working hours, set ka ng off days, matuto kang sabihin na ""I'll get back to you tomorrow."" Burnout is real, at pag na-burnout ka, wala kang kita, wala kang output, wala kang lahat.

**9. May emergency fund ka ba? Kung wala, simulan mo na.**

Walang employer na mag-cover ng leave mo, walang SSS na agad-agad, walang safety net kundi ikaw mismo. Before ka mag-flex ng bagong gadget or setup, siguraduhin mo meron kang at least 3-6 months na savings. Sa freelance, hindi consistent ang income — may months na baha ng projects, may months na tuyo. Yung peace of mind na may pera ka sa banko, 'yan ang totoong flex.

**10. Treat freelancing as a business, hindi hobby.**

Track mo yung income at expenses mo. Mag-invoice ka nang maayos. Mag-contract ka palagi — kahit kaibigan yung client. Set up ka ng professional email at profiles. Yung mga ""maliit"" na bagay na 'to ang difference ng freelancer na nag-su-survive lang at freelancer na nag-th-thrive. Ikaw ang CEO, accountant, marketing team, at janitor ng sarili mong business. Act like it.

Ayun lang, mga pre. Hindi madali ang freelance life, pero kung gagawin mo ng tama, walang ceiling ang growth mo dito. Walang boss na mag-lilimit sa sahod mo, ikaw ang magde-decide kung gaano ka kalayo ang aabutin mo.

Good luck sa inyong lahat. 🫡

Gamitin mo sa pag-draft, sa pag-brainstorm, sa pag-format, sa paghahanap ng ideas, sa pag-debug ng code — kahit araw-araw pa 'yan. Walang masama doon.

1qzcpkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1qzcpkr/snippet_new_author/,Snippet (new author),"A milky sheet of stratocumulus dispersed across the Milwaukee heavens—an azure sky breaking through the days of gray. Seo-Jin’s body felt a pound lighter, the rays of orange browning his jet-black hair. However the temperatures weren’t as generous as wispy smoke exited his mouth whenever he exhaled.

Six days into the year—four until school opens their doors once again. His foot hit concrete for the first time that January as the café entered his field of vision.

It feels like it’s been a long time since I came here, he thought.



Pushing the door open, a gentle chime welcomed him. Seo-Jin looked around, his eyes directed to their usual spot.

There she was, spinning a pen while staring at her notes.

“You’re starting without me?” he joked, distracting himself from the tightness in his chest.

“As if I could solve a question without you.”

“Alright, let’s get started then.”

Running her fingers across the page, Yuri read a question, a puzzled expression drawn on her face straight off the bat.

“You need help?""

“Wait, wait. Let me give this a proper shot.”

Now glaring at her paper, Yuri’s brows furrowed deeper as she groaned in frustration.

“Ok, I give up. This is way too difficult.”

Seo-Jin chuckled as Yuri continued grumbling. “Are you giving up already?” he asked.

“Anything wrong with that?” Yuri fired back.

Lightly shaking his head, Seo-Jin grabbed a pen from his pencil case, “O.K, for this question, it tells you to use the quadratic formula. Remember what that is?”

“X equals B, add or subtract the square root of B yada yada.”

“So what’s the first step in solving it?” Seo-Jin questioned, pointing at the X with his pen.

“Uhh… Substitute?”

“Yep, now just add forty-nine with forty-eight inside of the square root and there’s your answer.”

“Oh, that wasn’t as hard as I thought,” with a derpy expression, Yuri laughed flatly as it allusively brought a smitten smile to Seo-Jin’s face.

“I think you can solve these on your own though. I think you give up before you even try. Have some confidence in yourself.”



With rosy cheeks, Yuri hesitantly muttered, “You know, I’m really glad that I have someone like you in my life.”

Gently placing her arm onto Seo-Jin’s shoulder Yuri jested, “On my own, I’d be getting fat F’s on my report card!”

Turning his body towards her, Seo-Jin lightly flicked Yuri’s forehead, “You aren’t doing much better with me

by your side either.”

 

Pfft. Failing to stifle their giggle, the two burst into a chortle.

“I guess you’re right, haha,” agreeing in laughter, Yuri slouched onto the table, a subdued smile embedded onto her profile, “Still doesn’t change the fact that I suck at everything.”

 

The sound of the coffee bean grinder sparsely echoed off the walls as Seo-Jin clenched his jaw. With his widened eyes, he stumbled on his words. Of course, Yuri tried to play it off as a joke, but Seo-Jin sensed the words contained self-doubt buried deep into Yuri’s mind.

 

“That’s not true.”

 

The corners of her mouth feebly lifting, Yuri questioned, “Can you even name one thing I’m good at?”

“Do you want me to list them all?”

“If you insist.”

Clearing his throat, he jocosely adjusted his shirt.

“Let’s see… You’re great at lightening up the mood, making people feel welcomed, knowing when and how to cheer people up—“

Her smile widened as she interrupted in a flustered manner, “O.K, O.K. How about smarts?”

“Honestly, that won’t matter too much. Just you being you is enough.”

“So I’m good at everything but studying?”

“Really? That’s what you got out of it?”

Giggling, Yuri held her hand to her lips.

“I’m just messing with you! But thanks, I don’t know what I’d do without you.”

Seo-Jin’s eyes flashed upon the vulnerable words coming out of Yuri’s mouth entering his ears. Never had she been so candid. He thought, When did she start trusting me this much? Not even sure how to reply, Seo-Jin slapdashly blurted, “P-Probably even worse at math.”

“I can’t deny that” chuckling, she further captured    Seo-Jin’s vision.

Got it from a middle aged couple which they got it from their grandmas. They gave ma all books,magazines related to car which is nice.

Had to drive back from indianapolis to chicago. They warned me about how they didn’t take the car for long trips for a looong time and the car hasn’t been used a lot last 2 years so I should consider towing. But it would cost me minimum $500 so I wanted to try my luck.

Drive and attention was so much fun. I averaged 70-75mph all the way.

I had few breaks to grab a coffee and rest the miot. Few people hit me up with “sick miata bro” which made me smile.

I was expecting a surprise from the radiator since it’s all brown but 30 years old oem alternator belt said “hold on” 30 minutes before home :)

Heard a “pop” on highway and battery light came on. Temperature started raising. I stopped pressing the gas and slide on the highway until next exit and stopped immediately. I drove it less than a half mile after the incident so I assume car is fine.

If I had that $10 belt I’d be good to go but the the belt snapped right on one of chicagos most dangerous neighborhoods. Locked the doors, called the tow. Tow costed me $126 which is still less than $500 :)

I gave her a good wash and put it in my garage.

I assume everything is due at 60k miles so I already ordered all hoses, radiator, waterpump, thermostat, timing belt etc.

What’s good, fam? So here I am, a 17-year-old Bears fanatic living all the way in Johannesburg, South Africa, finally diving deep into my first-ever full NFL season. And guess what? Tomorrow, at 1:30 AM SAST on February 9, 2026, I’m about to watch my first live Super Bowl EVER: the epic Seahawks vs Patriots rematch! 



The buzz is unreal here. Imagine sitting in my room, walls decked out with Bears posters, that mix of adrenaline and nervous excitement tingling down my spine, and earphones in, catching every last bit of NFL podcast drama while the daylight slowly fades outside. The kettle is boiling for a second cup of coffee because, yeah, it’s gonna be a late night!  


Kickoff’s at 1:30 AM SAST Sunday night (which is technically Monday morning).

Time now: 5:49 PM on Saturday

Countdown: 7 hours and 41 minutes until game time. The clock is ticking, and my hype meter’s already OFF THE CHARTS!



From a kid raised miles from the States, with no local NFL culture until now, there’s something special about joining the global Bears family via this subreddit. The mix of hope, frustration, passion, that’s real. And in 2026 Bears fandom, as y’all know, there’s reason to stay hopeful. With the new stadium bill passed in Indiana recently and playoff runs earlier this year stirring the city, our team’s vibe is intense but thirsty for glory. The spirit here is like Brian Urlacher called it, badasses who grind even when the odds hit the fan.



Living it Loud and Proud

\- My makeshift game station in JHB includes a 50-inch screen (on loan from a mate), volume cranked so I can feel the crowd roar. The air smells like popcorn and buzzing anticipation.

\- Chat threads from r/ChicagoBearsNFL on my phone keep me updated live during commercial breaks, the banter and takes here are just next level.

\- Got my lucky Bears jersey and a cold Coke chilling, ready for the final showdown, while midnight snacks lay waiting. The chilly Johannesburg night somehow feels warmer with all this Bear pride pumping through.



Community Check-In: What I Gotta Know?

\- For all you lifetime Bears fans, what was your first Super Bowl experience like?! Any tips on keeping sane through the nail-biting moments? 

\- Who’s your dark horse in this Super Bowl rematch? Seahawks' defense or Patriots’ youthful fire? I’m torn!

\- Anyone else watching from outside the US and how are you handling those wild kickoff times? That 1:30 AM is savage.

\- And of course, what are you hoping to see from Caleb Williams next season? More hero plays or fewer boneheaded throws? (We all love that chaotic hope, right?)



Let’s Roar Together, Fam! This is more than just a game, it’s my first real taste of the NFL madness. From Jo’burg to Soldier Field spirit, I’m ready to ride this emotional rollercoaster with the best fans in the world, YOU GUYS! Let’s make this countdown loud, let the hype explode, and may the Bears’ relentless heart inspire us all to believe, win or lose, we’re in this together. BEAR DOWN and let’s bring some of that 312 magic all the way across the globe!

1qzckvu,https://notnottalmud.substack.com/p/contra-brian-potter-why-tvs-actually,contra Brian Potter: why TVs actually got cheap (and so few other things did),"I.  
Sometimes you read an article that teaches you something new, while simultaneously leaving you with a worse grasp of how the world actually works. I think [Brian Potter’s recent piece on why TVs got so cheap](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-did-tvs-get-so-cheap)) is one of them. If you read it, you will learn the technical reasons *how* TVs got cheaper, but you will miss the most important thing to know—which is what is unique about TVs and why nearly everything else didn’t.

As a general heuristic in the modern economy, manufactured goods should get much cheaper over time. The forces driving this are well known: increases in material science, manufacturing techniques, and information technology; access to cheaper global labour and capital; and massive economies of scale.

You can go on AliExpress to see this in action: the price of a generic widget is shockingly low. But then we look at the things we actually want to buy and say, “Wow, this is now so expensive.”

Contrary to the deflationary pressures above, there are four significant forces that explain why many things have gotten more expensive over time:

1. Labour costs have gone up (Baumol’s cost disease).
2. Real estate costs have gone up: zoning constraints and the increasing opportunity cost of land.
3. Regulatory mandates that force costly “improvements” consumers don’t directly value (energy efficiency standards, safety requirements, environmental compliance etc)
4. The decline of demand for that particular good

The fourth point is by far the most important point for understanding how the world works, but the one that is least understood.

II.  
Brian Potter writes a comprehensive overview of the manufacturing advances that drove down TV prices. We learn that LCD manufacturing scaled up mother glass sheets from 12x16 inches to 116x133 inches (the largest driver of cost declines), which reduced equipment costs per unit area by 80%. We learn about cluster plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition machines, the reduction of masking steps, and the switch from manual labour to robots, benefiting from techniques and knowledge borrowed from the semiconductor industry.

But, in a way, this is not all that interesting. This is just the story of industrial capitalism doing what it does for basically every physical good, what the ‘laws’ of capitalism impose on everything.

What’s interesting is understanding why these forces resulted in cheaper prices for TVs, but for so few other goods.

The true answer is that there isn’t a real market for “better” TVs. A TV can only be so good. We have hard material constraints in our homes regarding how large a screen can be, and biological limitations on our eyes regarding how many pixels we can actually see from the couch. The TV does not run software that perpetually needs access to better hardware to function (like phones and computers).

The TV also lost its power as a status symbol. Nobody comes over to your house anymore and judges you based on your television’s refresh rate. This has allowed TVs to become commodified. There is no demand for them to improve or distinguish themselves on performance—so instead of competition working to make TVs “better,” all those economic forces work exclusively to make the TV cheaper.

(A secondary but interesting reason is that TVs are often sold as loss leaders for stores or bundling opportunities for streaming services, subsidizing the hardware price. [See my previous post on how most businesses don’t work the way you think](https://notnottalmud.substack.com/p/most-businesses-dont-work-that-way) for more on this dynamic.)

If you think for a moment about one of the titans of modern capitalism, IKEA—most of what you can buy there is more expensive than the similar item IKEA was selling 20 years ago. But certain pieces, like the Billy Bookshelf or the Lack coffee table, have gone down in price over the last 30 years. Why? Because the Billy is a commodity purchased to fit a specific function. It isn’t used to signal status or fashion sense. For the Billy Bookshelf, IKEA is making roughly the same model as it used to, at massive scale, allowing those economic forces of modernity to lower costs. A brand new sofa that will only be sold for two years won’t have the scale to be manufactured in a way that allows it to become cheaper.

III.  
Now look at running shoes. Compared to when Nike first released their top-of-the-line running shoe in the early 1990s, you can absolutely buy a generic running shoe today that is objectively better and cheaper. But if you ask people who identify as runners, you will find they are spending *more* on shoes than ever before.

That’s because runners aren’t buying the “Billy Bookshelf” of shoes. Instead of there being one singular running shoe, there are now endless choices for every micro-purpose: tempo runs, trail runs, long runs, carbon-plated race shoes. Despite the technology being cheaper, nearly everyone who identifies as a runner wants a “better” shoe. While part of this is we want new shoes that physically look different, it’s mostly because of the inflation of “impressiveness.” It used to be impressive to run a 5k; now, unless you’re training for a half-marathon with a specific time goal, or a 50K ultra, are you even running? We need the new gear just to keep up with the Joneses on Strava.

This situation is even more extreme in road cycling. The components on the bike you buy need to be compatible with an ecosystem that is constantly evolving to be “better”: wider tires, tubeless setups, disc brakes, electronic shifting, aero frames. And because most people want to ride with others, and those others are riding faster, more expensive bikes, the social baseline for what constitutes an “acceptable” bike shifts upward.

The cruel irony is that these “improvements” often don’t even make the experience better in aggregate. Everyone spending $2000 more on their bike just to keep pace with the group ride means we’re all poorer but no happier—the exact opposite of what happened with TVs, where we’re all richer and watching the same shows.

All of these forces have the total effect of making it so the “standard” good you bought before is no longer produced at scale, which already removes the key cost-reducing driver. Demand is shifted to an ever-changing set of specialized, higher-status goods, which consume the gains from manufacturing efficiency to fund “improvements” or distinguishing factors you may or may not actually need—and which collectively, often don’t leave us better off.

So, the real interesting part of TVs becoming cheaper isn’t just the material science of glass sheets. It’s that the TV is a rare instance where there was no improvement to be had or status to be gained from the purchase. Almost every consumer category starts with genuine innovation, but the moment there is any social value from the purchase, market forces redirect those efficiency gains away from “cheaper” and toward better and “premium differentiation.” By allowing the TVs to become a commodity, we enabled the forces of modern capitalism to compete exclusively on price, rather than using that efficiency to fund an endless, expensive war for “better”. The how, which Brian Potter exposes, is not nearly as interesting or important as the uniqueness of the why.",6,1770566331.0,slatestarcodex,0,0.88,False

I kept thinking it was some kind of spirit haunting the house, since I heard the wood creaking—not like wood breathing, but more like footsteps—upstairs, specifically in the hallway.I would hear that sound at any time of day. At first, it scared me a bit. One day, I decided I would make coffee whenever I smelled tobacco, and I started doing it for three consecutive days. Here's what I did: as soon as I smelled tobacco, I would brew some coffee, sit in my usual coffee chair, and move the chair next to me. As I said, I did this for three more days, but before doing it on the last day I smelled it, I told my sister on the phone, ""I'm going to brew some coffee and drink it with whoever's around so they won't smoke their tobacco alone, and I won't drink my coffee alone."" After that third day, I didn't smell tobacco again. That happened months ago, and just two days ago, I started smelling cigarettes again.",2,1770566165.0,Ghoststories,1,1.0,False

**Title:** Unwind the Grown-Up Way 🎨✨ (Free Adult Coloring Book PDF Inside)

Let’s be real — adulting is… a lot. Emails, bills, endless tabs open both on your browser and in your mind.  
Some days it feels like everything is in high definition except your peace of mind.  

Then one evening, I grabbed a coloring page “just for fun.”  
No phone, no deadlines — just me, colors, and a quiet cup of tea.  
And for the first time that week, my breathing slowed down. The noise dimmed.  
I remembered what it felt like to simply *create*, not produce.

That’s when it hit me — coloring isn’t just for kids.  
It’s for tired, overworked adults who need a mindful escape without booking a yoga retreat.

Before I share my free PDF, here’s what I’ve learned (and what science says, too):  
• Coloring helps reduce stress and anxiety by shifting the brain into a meditative state.  
• It unlocks your creative mind — even if you don’t think you’re “artsy.”  
• Most importantly, it’s one of the few things that *forces* you to slow down and be present.

So, I created a relaxing **Adult Coloring Book PDF** filled with elegant, mood-lifting designs meant for real life breaks — the kind between meetings, commutes, or Sunday self-care rituals.

👉 **Download it free right here:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

And because a little consistency goes a long way…  
Set aside 15 minutes tonight. Pour your favorite drink, grab some markers or pencils, and just *color*.  
No rules. No perfect lines. No productivity targets.  
Just you and the page.  

You’ll be amazed at how a few shades of color can reset your entire mindset.  
If it helps you, try sharing it — maybe a stressed friend or coworker could use ten minutes of calm, too.

Let’s normalize creativity and calm for grown-ups the way we do coffee breaks.  
Who knows? Maybe the secret to surviving modern life isn’t another app… it’s a box of colored pencils.

This Target Clearance Hack Gets You 90% OFF For Instant Resell Profit (FBA Ready!)**,"Alright MaximizeMe crew, let's talk about something spicy that just got yanked. You know how sometimes you stumble upon a goldmine, and then... poof? Yeah, I've been there.

So, there was this *insane* clearance hack at Target. We’re talking like, genuinely 90% off on items that were practically begging to be flipped. Think small appliances, home goods, even some decent clothing that just needed a little rebranding. The kind of stuff you could grab, list on Amazon FBA, and see a sweet little profit before you even finished your coffee.

It was all about hitting those clearance aisles *right* after a seasonal reset, when they’re just dumping everything to make room. And the secret sauce? It wasn't just about the sticker price. It was about understanding how Target marks down certain categories, and knowing when to scan *everything*. Honestly, the margin was ridiculous. I saw people grabbing things for $5 that were selling for $50 online. Instant profit, baby!

But here’s the kicker: it's been… let's just say ""discouraged."" If you catch my drift. Apparently, Target isn't too thrilled about their clearance sections becoming direct pipelines to FBA warehouses. So, that specific *method* might be dead in the water now. BANNED, as the title implies. Shucks.

However, the *principle* behind it? That's still gold. It’s about smart shopping, spotting underpriced inventory, and understanding market demand. And honestly, learning to spot these kinds of opportunities, even the ones that get shut down, is a skill. It sharpens your eye for value.

If you’re curious about the *type* of thinking that went into discovering these kinds of deals, and how to develop that ""deal hunter"" instinct, there's a place where they break down a lot of this stuff. It’s not the *exact* Target hack because, well, you know. But it’s the kind of knowledge that helps you find these pockets of profit in general. You can peek at it here: [https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals](https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals) – just for the strategic insight, of course.

It just goes to show, the game always changes. What works today might be yesterday's news tomorrow. But the *fundamentals* of smart arbitrage? Those stick around.

Im just so surprised why it didnt happen at all and I'm totally happy cause this tea revived my love for tea which I used to avoid at all costs switching to coffee.

Also im so proud of my country and i hope this brand thrives along with the entire ceylon tree industry. So I'd like to invite my fellow sri lankans to taste it if you havent yet.

(I'm a 45 year old dad, work in unrelated field).

But then I realized it was the adrenaline of finishing that project that was keeping me going. I had come up with some contenders for ""Now what?"" subsequent projects, but I could not find my mojo to get up and going at 4am.

On Dec 3, I decided I needed a better long term program. Here's what I came up with:

(1) I stopped drinking completely - I was not a huge drinker, but even 1-2 drinks makes an early wakeup unpleasant, and with a lot of holiday events on the calendar, a whole month of mornings was going to get hijacked.

(2) I moved my wake up from 4am to 5am. 1 hour is better than 0, and if I get back into the groove I can get a head start whenever I beat the alarm.

(3) I added a 15 minute ""brainstorming coffee"" break. Every afternoon when I usually go grab a coffee and drink it at my desk, instead I've been staying in the cafe with a sheet of paper/pen and I write down my to do list for the next morning. Then when I get home I drop it on my home desk. I think ""sleeping on"" this list has made me totally ready to rock at 5am.

It has been huge. I think the drinking thing alone has been such a big improvement. I wondered what people would think, but no one has even asked - at my age no one cares at all. There is also non-alcoholic beer everywhere which I wouldn't write home about, but it's totally adequate.

1qzc6gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qzc6gc/how_to_actually_be_rizzy_in_2025_the/,How to Actually Be Rizzy in 2025: The Psychology-Based Guide That Works,"Let me hit you with some real talk. You've probably seen a thousand posts about ""how to have rizz"" that just tell you to ""be confident"" or ""work on yourself."" Cool. Thanks for nothing. That's like telling someone who's drowning to just swim better.



Here's what I found after going deep into psychology research, communication studies, and yeah, even watching way too many charisma breakdowns on YouTube. Turns out, being rizzy isn't some magical gift you're born with. It's a learnable skill set that combines emotional intelligence, body language, storytelling, and genuine interest in other people. And before you roll your eyes, this isn't theory. These are practical tools pulled from neuroscience, behavioral psychology, and communication experts who've studied what actually makes people magnetic.



The truth is, most of us weren't taught this stuff. Society doesn't exactly hand out classes on social dynamics or interpersonal attraction. We're expected to just figure it out, and when we struggle, we blame ourselves. But attraction and social magnetism follow patterns. Once you understand those patterns, you can work with them instead of against them.



 Step 1: Stop Trying So Hard (Seriously)



The biggest rizz killer? Desperation. When you're trying too hard to impress someone, they can smell it from a mile away. Your energy shifts. You become performative instead of authentic. And people's brains are wired to detect inauthenticity because it signals potential deception.



Here's what to do instead: Approach interactions with curiosity, not outcome obsession. You're not trying to ""win"" someone over. You're exploring whether you vibe. This mental shift changes everything about how you show up. Your body language relaxes. Your conversation flows better. You stop monitoring every word for maximum impact.



Try this: Before your next social interaction, tell yourself ""I'm just here to see if this person is interesting"" instead of ""I need to make them like me."" Notice how differently you feel.



 Step 2: Master the Art of Active Listening (Not Waiting to Talk)



Real rizz comes from making people feel heard and understood. Most people in conversations are just waiting for their turn to speak. They're not actually listening. They're formulating their next impressive story or witty comeback.



Research from Harvard psychologist Dr. Jack Schafer shows that people who ask follow up questions and demonstrate genuine curiosity are perceived as significantly more likable and attractive. Why? Because being truly heard activates the brain's reward centers. You're literally giving people a dopamine hit by paying attention to them.



The technique: Use the ""thread pulling"" method. When someone mentions something, pull that thread deeper instead of pivoting to your own story. They say they went hiking last weekend? Don't immediately launch into your hiking story. Ask ""What made you choose that trail?"" or ""How'd you get into hiking?""



People will remember how you made them feel way longer than they'll remember what you said.



 Step 3: Develop Your Storytelling Game



Charismatic people are good storytellers. Period. Stories activate multiple parts of the listener's brain and create emotional resonance. But here's the thing, good storytelling isn't about making yourself sound impressive. It's about creating shared emotional experiences.



Structure your stories using the simple formula: Setup, Tension, Resolution. Keep them tight. No one wants to hear your 10 minute saga about traffic this morning. But a 90 second story about the weird dude you met at the coffee shop who tried to sell you essential oils? That works.



Add sensory details: Instead of ""I went to this cool restaurant,"" try ""I walked into this place that smelled like garlic and burnt wood, right? And this chef was literally yelling at someone in Italian."" Details make stories come alive.



Check out [Charisma on Command](https://www.youtube.com/user/charismaoncommand) on YouTube. Charlie Houpert breaks down exactly how charismatic people tell stories using examples from actors and public figures. Insanely practical stuff. He analyzes body language, tonality, pacing, all of it. I've watched probably 50 of his videos and each one gives you something you can use immediately.



 Step 4: Fix Your Body Language (You're Sabotaging Yourself)



Your body is talking even when your mouth isn't. And it might be saying ""I'm uncomfortable"" or ""I don't belong here"" without you realizing it.



Power posing works, despite what some recent studies suggest. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy's research shows that expansive postures (taking up space) can actually shift your hormone levels and confidence. Before social situations, spend 2 minutes in a power pose. Sounds stupid. Works anyway.



In conversation: Keep your shoulders back. Maintain eye contact but don't be a psycho about it (look away naturally every few seconds). Angle your body toward the person. Don't cross your arms. Smile with your eyes, not just your mouth.



Slow down your movements. Anxious people move quickly and jerkily. Confident people move deliberately. This is a game changer that nobody talks about.



 Step 5: Develop Actual Interests and Opinions



You can't fake being interesting. You need to actually be interested in things. Read books. Have hobbies. Form opinions. Nothing kills a conversation faster than someone who has nothing to contribute beyond surface level small talk.



Read ""[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://dn720004.ca.archive.org/0/items/english-collections-1/How%20To%20Win%20Friends%20And%20Influence%20People%20-%20Carnegie%2C%20Dale.pdf)"" by Dale Carnegie. Yeah, it's from 1936. Doesn't matter. This book has sold over 30 million copies for a reason. Carnegie breaks down the psychology of likability and influence in ways that still hold up almost 90 years later. The core principle? People are primarily interested in themselves, so make conversations about them, not you. This isn't manipulation, it's understanding human nature.



The book will fundamentally change how you approach conversations. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's probably the most practical social skills book ever written.



If you want to go deeper without spending hours reading, there's an AI-powered learning app called [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)that's genuinely useful for this kind of stuff. Built by a team from Columbia University and former Google AI experts, it turns knowledge from books like Carnegie's, plus dating psychology research and expert interviews into personalized audio content.



You can set a specific goal like ""become more magnetic as an introvert in social situations"" and it'll build a structured learning plan tailored to your personality and struggles. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute summaries during your commute to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when you want to really understand something. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes the content way more engaging than typical audiobook narration.



Also check out the app Finch for building better daily habits around self improvement. It's a self care app that gamifies personal growth. You set goals, do small daily tasks, and your little bird companion levels up with you. Sounds corny but it actually helps you build the consistency needed to develop new skills and interests.



 Step 6: Learn to Be Playfully Teasing (Without Being Mean)



Playful teasing creates tension and shows you're comfortable enough to not take everything seriously. But there's a fine line between flirty banter and just being an asshole.



The rule: Tease up, not down. Make fun of confident, positive things about someone, not their insecurities. Tease about their designer coffee order or their obsession with a TV show, not their appearance or something they're sensitive about.



Use callbacks. If someone mentions something earlier in the conversation, reference it later as an inside joke. This creates connection and shows you were paying attention.



 Step 7: Get Comfortable with Silence



Awkward silence makes most people panic and start word vomiting to fill the void. Rizzy people let silence breathe. They're comfortable with pauses. Sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is just smile and let a moment sit.



Practice this: In your next conversation, after someone says something meaningful or funny, pause for 2 seconds before responding. Don't immediately jump in. Let the moment land. It creates weight and shows you're actually processing what they said.



 Step 8: Improve Your Voice and Tonality



Your voice matters more than you think. Research shows that vocal tonality accounts for about 38% of communication impact. A monotone voice kills charisma.



Vary your pitch and pace. Speed up when telling exciting parts of a story. Slow down for emphasis. Lower your pitch slightly (not artificially) for authority. Go higher for enthusiasm.



Stop uptalking. That thing where you end statements like they're questions? It undermines everything you say. Record yourself talking and listen back. You'll be horrified but it's the fastest way to identify bad vocal habits.



 Step 9: Handle Rejection Like It's Feedback, Not Failure



Here's the thing about rizz, even the rizziest people get rejected. The difference is they don't internalize it as proof they're unworthy. They see it as incompatibility.



Reframe rejection as data collection. Didn't vibe with that person? Cool, you learned something about what you're looking for or how you're showing up. Move on without the emotional spiral.



The book ""[Rejection Proof](https://cdn.bookey.app/files/pdf/book/en/rejection-proof.pdf)"" by Jia Jiang is wild for this. The author spent 100 days deliberately seeking rejection to desensitize himself to it. He documents the whole thing and the insights are gold. You'll realize rejection is way less scary when you understand it's just a normal part of human interaction, not a referendum on your worth.



 Step 10: Take Care of Your Baseline Attractiveness



Look, I hate to be that guy, but you can't out rizz basic hygiene and presentation. Get a decent haircut. Wear clothes that fit. Smell good. Take care of your skin. Hit the gym occasionally. These aren't superficial vanity things, they're baseline self respect signals.



When you look like you give a shit about yourself, it changes how you carry yourself. That confidence bleeds into everything else.



Real talk: Start with one thing. Maybe it's getting serious about skincare. Maybe it's finally figuring out what clothes actually fit your body type. Build from there.



Bottom line? Rizz isn't magic. It's emotional intelligence, communication skills, genuine interest in others, and enough self respect to show up as your real self. Master those and you'll be rizzy without even trying.

Hell, as a Shadow Dragon I kissed roleplay common sense goodbye and saved Treviso just for him.

But then the inevitable happened. That first flirt interaction was a false alarm. The more I flirted with Lucanis the more confused and frustrated I got. It was like flirting with a wall. Most of the time I got no response at all to the point I thought the game was bugged and skipping Lucanis' reaction to the flirt triggers. The rare times I got responses, they were lukewarm at best. And all the while he was flirting with Neve, lmfao (which, hey, I like the ship, but at least let me in! We could be happy the three of us!). I felt deflated. Mood ruined.

So, yikes. Time to restart.

I'm the kind of person who flirts with and romances only one character per game since all my PCs are hopeless romantics at heart who only fall once and fall hard, so I couldn't bring myself to pivot to another romance in the same playthrough. So I restarted. Same character and all, same decisions, I basically replayed the 30 or so hours identically, only I didn't flirt with Lucanis and adopted him as a bff/brother figure instead.

Davrin was my natural second choice. I thought I would feel really off playing the romance because he was my rebound after Lucanis failed me, but.

BUT.

Holy shit Davrin I owe you an apology, I wasn't familiar with your game.

What a gem of a romance. The chemistry with Rooks was off the charts once I took the Lucanis-blindfold off. The flirt scenes had me kicking my feet and giggling and grabbing my face. The VOICE. The LOOKS. And the whole verbal foreplay thingy with ""the thrill of the hunt""? Sweet Jesus, what a MAN.
 
I hadn't interacted that much with him in my first go at the game so he was just the serious Grey Warden my Rook casually vibed with, but this time I discovered such a sweet, playful, kind-hearted side to him. And emotional vulnerability! It melted my heart when he asked Rook if she could see this thing between them going somewhere or not. The romance was wholesome as hell but also felt really mature, something I appreciated.

The first kiss/commitment scene with him and Assan in the forest lives rent free in my head. Sometimes a family is you, your boyfriend, and your griffon son who talks to you when you're high on mushroom tea.

I thought this would be a lukewarm romance that couldn't compare to my other DA romances (Alistair/Fenris/Cullen), a stain in an otherwise impeccable romance career, but I was wrong. I got invested, I got romanced to hell and back, and I'm so glad I gave Davrin a choice. 

He was not the romance I planned but he was definitely the romance I needed.
 
(Plus, I headcanon my Rook has the world's biggest harmless crush on Antoine, and Evka teases her endlessly about how Grey Warden elves are definitely Rook's type and at least now she got one of her own lol.)",25,1770565381.0,dragonage,7,0.82,False

I had a Mr Coffee espresso machine, and loved that thing.  Used it daily.  However, yesterday, I took the basket out without relieving the pressure using the valve at the top of the machine.  I know, stupid.  I thought it was done brewing, because it had been a few minutes, and the shot looked done, and that step just slipped my mind because I was in a rush.

Naturally, the basket got blasted out of the machine an shattered the carafe, and covered my kitchen in broken glass and coffee grounds.

Shitty way to start the day, but my question is: can I just buy a new carafe?  Is the machine still safe to use?  There was no mechanical failure; just my own stupidity.

1qzc5jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemonolatryPractices/comments/1qzc5jt/late_night_dreaming_w_lucifer/,Late Night Dreaming w/ Lucifer,"Last night I had fallen asleep to some sort of guided meditation, specifically one to help me connect with Lucifer, and before falling asleep and having found a nice audio to sleep to; I swear I had a moment of hearing his voice before I slept. Every so often I have auditory hallucinations before sleeping, but usually only when I'm falling asleep and get jolted awake. I had been still very much awake when I heard him, in which his voice was very brief and short but clear as he reminded me that I was loved. It had been the first time I heard his voice, but I knew it was him.

If you've seen my posts and comments before, you would know I'm pretty active with working with Lord Lucifer, mainly just trying my best to interact with him more in my dreams, as I do a lot of dream work thanks to my extremely vivid dreams.

The other night I had been in contact with him and did a reading for myself as he seemed to want to tell me something.
(The Lovers Reversed, The High Priestess, The Empress, and the Devil Reversed, though I'm unsure about the last one as I originally thought he had just been pulling his card to let me know he was still with me). I'm still meditating on their meanings, but Lucifer did clarify that it has some involving with my mental health and likely how I'm acting towards myself and said I have the right idea space, though I think I'm still missing some kind of understanding towards it.

But about the dreams I had;

I had a dream about taking a mental health day, in where I was in my room talking to my mother, and my father had invited a stranger into our home to feed him and get him warm. Then I remember doing my makeup and smudging it, so I had to wipe it all away to restart. I got frustrated at first, but then the dream quickly shifted and suddenly I was in a library and witchy store with my best friend. A young man who seemed to be close to our age was running the place and we both befriended him. We were led to this corner of the store which had just been an area of books. Old and strange looking books with different symbols and covers, all about knowledge, magic, divination, demonology, etc. I was looking for specifically anything about Lucifer. And I remember pausing and picking up a book, putting my hand up to the black cover with red symbols because there was a place for a palm to fit, and mine fit perfectly. And suddenly the room started to fill with water, but none of the books were damaged and everyone had been acting as if this has been normal and remained calm, so did I. My dream shifted and I was outside on the road by a truck. There had been snow on the ground and I was on the phone with my friend and we were headed to the same library we had just been at. I had water attached to a hose and I said ""I'm on my way, I'm just watering the grass real quick, hoping it might grow,"" and started watering the snow, dirt and hibernating grass. Then we went back to the library, met back up with the man and he offered us some coffee and ice cream. Then I woke up to my mother having surprised me with a frappuccino.

This was actually a lot more calm and organized than my usual dreams, which I've noticed is a pattern when I'm doing dream work.

If anyone has any ideas on the meaning behind my dream or have had similar expeirences, let me know! I'm super curious :)",2,1770565335.0,DemonolatryPractices,1,1.0,False

Por causa disso o ambiente é bem intimista, com luzes baixas, cortinas tapando as janelas e móveis rústicos na decoração do salão. 

O lugar trabalha com uma variedade bem grande de drinks, entre clássicos e autorais. Além dos petiscos e outras bebidas, que acabamos não pedindo porque fomos pelos drinks 

Pedimos uma régua de degustação da casa com três drinks à nossa escolha: Pink pork cocktail (whisky Maker's Mark, fatwash de bacon, vermute rosso e Campari cask coffee); Um dia depois de amanhã (Arpo gin, infusão de caju com baunilha, sour mix e angostura); e Antes do fim do mundo (Maker's Mark infusionado no café e canela por 48h, licor Cabra Lab e angostura Dolin rosso). Além deles, pedimos também um Fresh Garden (cachaça Quero Chuva de guaraná e açaí, vodka Nuda, limão e pink lemonade) e uma dose maior do Antes do fim do mundo. No total gastamos R$200 

Eu sempre curti a ideia de bares de rock, apesar de as minhas experiências com isso na cidade nunca terem sido das melhores — SP é imbatível nessa, na minha opinião. Daí que ter descoberto esse e a proposta dele me fez criar grandes expectativas em cima, e elas me foram muito bem atendidas. Todos os coquetéis estavam muito gostosos e complexos em sabores, aromas e texturas. O clima intimista do bar é perfeito pra reunir a galera e bater papo, e a beleza do ambiente é um ponto bem alto também — um ótimo lugar pra dates, até.

So I (29M) am going to a wedding in a few weeks and decided to purchase a new suit for the occasion. I went to my local suit store with a couple of friends and we were immediately greeted by a cute guy offering his assistance. I’d guess he’s probably within 2-3 years of me in age, most likely on the younger side. He was very congenial and professional throughout our first interaction and we were able to find a suit I love, but they needed to order it as they didn’t have it in my size. This first meeting was fairly brief as I already had a clear idea of what I wanted, so I wouldn’t say we interacted much. While I’m normally rather witty and charming in person, I tend to shut down when I’m around guys I find attractive out of pure nervousness. Not a great first showing, I know.

Anyways, after we left the store I started gushing about him to my friends but also said I should probably ignore those feelings given my track record with guys. It’s 100% not intentional on my part, but historically whenever I’ve been interested in a guy they almost always turn out to be straight. It’s become such a recurring problem for me that I don’t really trust my own gaydar anymore and tend to automatically assume I have no chance as a result. However, both of my friends were extremely certain he was gay and, seeing as I’d be back in a week or so for alterations once the suit arrived, I decided I’d try to test the waters to see if there was anything to their suspicions at our next meeting.

When I came back to the suit store, the same guy was there to help again and the vibe was immediately much more relaxed and casual. We struck up a conversation and I learned about his work/education history, his family dynamics/cultural background, and his coffee preferences, among other things. Towards the end of this second interaction I made plans to meet with him at the store again for a final fitting on Valentine’s Day and cracked a joke about whether or not this makes him my valentine (corny I know). He responded with a laugh, suggested I bring him flowers and chocolates, and then we wrapped up our second meeting on rather friendly terms.

Now, I know he was probably joking, but I’m a hopeless romantic and part of me is thinking I should take a big swing and *actually* do what he suggested. I’d also bring a bag of his favorite coffee beans and give the whole package to him as a thank you for all his help, but I’d also include a note with my number and a little message asking him out. Though this could definitely be perceived as excessive and inappropriate, I figure his comment to me and the fact that our final meeting is actually on Valentine’s Day means I could just disguise it as me being funny. He won’t know I’m actually asking him out until he reads the note after I leave the store, so if he’s not gay/not interested he can simply choose not to reach out. He’d likely never have to see me again either as I won’t be in need of a new suit for a while.

The question I ask you all is what approach to go with. Should I:

A) take the risk and go all-in with the plan mentioned above?

B) go the discreet route and just give him my number on my way out?

C) not engage at all and end our final interaction on a platonic note?",3,1770565195.0,askgaybros,2,1.0,False

i am 30 year old trans woman who is going through and exceptionally brutal and swift divorce. i have had to find safe places outside of my home to spend my days away from my child, per her birthing person's request. While this meant I spent the majority of the last month in cafes and coffee shops, it also meant that I was seeking validation and was in emotional pain.

my favorite way to get through emotional times and to come out the other side different is piercings and tattoos. one of the very first things I did with my own money was get my left double nostril pierced, which I did last week and am very stoked on. 

the boy:

the piercing apprentice at my shop is incredible, and has shown me an insane amount of positivity as I've been going through this divorce.

that positivity went from like 'heyyy its good to see you' to like 'you're not leaving any time soon are you...?' and i haven’t been more sure someone was flirting with me in a decade lmao. we have talked a LOT about mental health and anatomy, and connected on both being fans of talking about/drawing anatomy/gore as a way to avoid self harm, which i thought was a pretty niche and cool thing to share in common, as historically I've always felt bad being a fan of it.

after my like fourth day hanging out at the shop, i was inspired to finish a piece i had started and to gift it to him. the night previous i had made a joke on ig,  'don't keep a door open if you don't want to let strays in boy', which i thought was not only appropriate but also funny as shit. I still stand by it being funny lol.

but the next day when I went to grab my phone charger and gift him the art, which I did, he was happy to see me but seemed awkward about the interaction.

I sent follow up messages on ig but didnt receieve any response. i'm literally petrified that i ruined my relationship with my shop because i tried to be flirty back. idk if i missed some social cues somewhere and fucked up, or if they just shelled up because they realized they were flirting with me and didn't mean to be 🤷‍♀️

1qzbzaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingPT/comments/1qzbzaz/ipo_discord/,IPO - Discord,"O Discord tornou-se, acidentalmente, a camada de integração universal para toda a economia dos criadores.
A Camada de Infraestrutura
O Patreon tem um bot oficial (250 mil criadores), mas o Ko-fi, a Twitch e dezenas de outros também têm. Criadores do Substack usam Sidestack ou Bind para sincronizar pagamentos do Stripe com cargos no Discord. O Buy Me a Coffee integra via Zapier.

Todas as plataformas de criadores que correm sobre o Stripe podem automatizar a atribuição de cargos no Discord com base na verificação de pagamento. A única grande exceção é o OnlyFans, que não tem integração oficial, forçando os criadores a usar bots de verificação manual.

O Discord não está a competir com estas plataformas — é uma infraestrutura neutra onde todas as ferramentas de monetização precisam de se integrar.
Podes estar em 50 servidores com uma única conta.
Custo de mudança zero.
Pagamento = prova de humanidade + atribuição automática de cargos.
Isto não é apenas uma ""app de chat para gamers que cresceu"" — é a camada de autenticação económica da internet.

📝Os Números e Metas de IPO

O problema de comparação torna-se mais fácil quando percebes que o TAM (Mercado Total Endereçável) do Discord é toda a economia de criadores, não apenas comunidades de gaming.
Receita: Cerca de 800 milhões de dólares.


Alvo de Avaliação (IPO): 10-15 mil milhões de dólares (12.5x a 18.75x a receita).
Intervalo Inteligente: Avaliação de 10-12 mil milhões (cerca de 43-52 $/ação, se a estrutura for semelhante à do Reddit).

🎯Alvos de Preço:
Abaixo de 45 $: Compra forte. Estás a comprar mais barato do que no mercado secundário, onde o ""dinheiro informado"" fecha entre 6.8 e 10 mil milhões.

Entre 45 $ e 55 $: Preço justo, mas sem margem de segurança.
Acima de 65 $ (mais de 15 mil milhões): Pagar mais de 18.75x a receita por uma empresa que ainda não é lucrativa é uma idiotice.

Nota: O Reddit lançou o IPO a 8x a receita, duplicou rapidamente e depois voltou à terra.

🐂vs 🐻 Cenário Otimista (Bull) vs. Pessimista (Bear) 

O Bull Case: O Discord é o ""Stripe para acesso a comunidades"". Todo o escritor do Substack, artista do Patreon ou criador de cursos usa o Discord porque as integrações de pagamento funcionam e é uma infraestrutura gratuita que eles não têm de construir. Se conseguirem monetizar sem destruir o plano gratuito (o desastre da API do Reddit serve de aviso), o caminho para o lucro é óbvio.

O Bear Case: Continuam a oferecer a infraestrutura de graça e não conseguem converter utilizadores suficientes para as subscrições Nitro.
Veredito Final

Estou à espera do preço real do IPO, mas:
Abaixo de 50 $: Abro posição.
Acima de 65 $: Passo à frente.

As plataformas abertas estão estruturalmente condenadas devido ao ""lixo"" gerado por IA; o Discord é onde as comunidades reais se formam e são a única camada de infraestrutura neutra que todos já utilizam. Só não pagues demasiado por isso.

We had a dinner party / hang with some friends and family last night that normally I would have been good and buzzed well before company showed up, and I would have continued throwing down till the wee hours. Instead I was in bed by 10:30. This morning I was up at 8 with my dog, have had a quiet morning drinking coffee and watching curling while the rest of the house sleeps in, and instead of having the absolute dread of the three dishes I need to make for the party we're going to later hanging over my head  I am happily game planning, relaxed knowing I'm not going to have any time crunch, proud that my spouse and our friend riding with us can drink however much they want without having to worry about me having too much to get us home, and looking forward to being bright eyed and clear headed when I log on to work at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

I'm hoping this enthusiasm for the little things sticks with me and outweighs the desire to drink for a long time but I wanted to make this post as a reminder for my future self of how good this feels and invite you all to share what other little things add up for you to keep you going.",6,1770564839.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False
1qzbxkt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qzbxkt,A glimpse into my growing collection.,"Always wanted a bookshelf since I started reading (college days). Then I’d just borrow books from library/friends or read epubs, now the collection stands around 80 books. 

Got this bookshelf made last year and now it’s about to get overfilled, will probably need another one if I don’t control my buying sprees (which I have under control for now because of the pressure from my Mother). Even most of these are still unread, so she wants me to get done with these first. 

Got away from reading for a major part of last year, just trying to get back into it now. No specific target though.

1qzbvod,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1qzbvod/28f_weight_loss_mostly_improved_symptoms_4lbs_in/,"28F - Weight loss, mostly improved symptoms, -4lbs in one night?!","TLDR; It started out in late August with severe symptoms like gnawing pain, eventual difficulty swallowing, and constant reflux, but after 5.5 months of quitting alcohol and coffee, I’ve improved enough to eat heavy meals again with sometimes minor heartburn. I do still have lingering mild stabbing pains when hungry and get occasional flare-ups the next day for a few days if I overdo it on my caffeine or fats. Despite the symptom improvement, I’m spiraling because I’ve lost 29 pounds total, including a weird 4-pound drop overnight (today), and I'm wondering if this sounds like normal weight loss from lifestyle changes rather than something sinister.. Is GERD really this bad?! Is it more gastritis/ulcer healing? I chickened out on my endoscopy (justified it with improvement), and now I don't have health insurance since mine went up $120 and can't fork it out. Note: I've not tried PPIs or meds other than tums as needed, wanted to try fixing my habits first to see if it'd help. It has, but not sure if I actually need them or not...

Details:

So at the beginning of this (August 26, 2025), I was about 187lbs - I was a daily drinker (white claw, grapefruit, a mystery how I got likely gastritis/small ulcer + GERD combo...), coffee on empty stomach for like 13 years (no one told me!). The first flare of symptoms was horrible.

About a month before it started, I felt odd sharp stabs in my stomach area. Brushed it off, even though I knew that meant I should probably quit drinking (woohoo high-functioning alcoholism). The day it started: gnawing and burning epigastric pain when I didn't eat, felt uncomfortably full, like a golf ball was sitting in my solar plexus for 45 mins after little food. Acid reflux started a few days later, coffee tasted like chemical, my throat was sore, eventually swallowing became difficult and it felt like food kept sticking in my throat. Regurgitation of liquids when I bent over, non-stop burping, breathing got uncomfortable sometimes because it feels like my abdomen won't stretch any further. Sometimes nausea, especially if I accidentally had something too acidic (A1 almost made me throw up). Early satiety. Walking too much made it hurt. No blood in stools, no vomit.

I cut out drinking, helped a good chunk, switched to my old vape, helped a bit. Cutting out coffee was the game-changer for me though, same-day difference and it's been improving ever since. I can even have a drink or two and feel fine (I still don't though because I generally feel healthier).

Now I drink black tea. I get a flare up for a few days of early satiety, pressure, burping, very mild regurgitation on bending now if I have 4 teas in a day or have a very high fat day the day before. The only persistent symptom I have now is epigastric stabbing in my solar plexus if I'm hungry or just ate. It's mostly mild, just noticeable. Today it hasn't happened yet, actually thankfully. I had 4 meals yesterday: 2 rounds of chicken cordeon bleu, 1 shepherd's pie, one slice of pepperoni pizza. I felt fine. I was 162 pounds yesterday. 158 today?!? My weight normally fluctuates by a pound, max 2. Four is bonkers?!

Does this sound like GERD or... I don't know. I have a bit of health anxiety, so I try to keep any big C thoughts hushed. But... Idk man? If I'm improving, probably not??? The weight loss is what's kinda bogging me, oddly. I'm a 5'2"" woman so I need to, and it's likely from not drinking anymore and generally eating better... but... you know? I've lost 29 pounds now since this started in August.

1qzbvfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qzbvfh/i_went_on_a_camping_trip_and_i_came_back_the/,I went on a camping trip and I came back The Witness,"I’m still not sure if it all really happened. I was young and stupid at that time and I  don’t understand why we went there in the first place. But, now everything is different, I am different. What you are about to read happened many years ago. You can believe me or not but be warned, do not venture out into the wild in ignorance, I have a hunch where we went isn’t Her only dwelling place.

So, let’s start from the beginning of that awful trip.

Part 1: Arrival

I moved my head from the car window and wiped the condensation off to get a better look at the frozen landscape outside. Passing by were tall street lights, faintly illuminating the ground beneath them. The morning sun peeking over the horizon, however, gave us the most light. Beyond the lights were walls of dark green on either side of us; we had only seen trees for a few miles at that point.

Even though I wasn’t the biggest fan of snow or dreary weather, I was pretty excited for that trip, though looking back, I wish I wasn’t. With all the responsibilities that come with work and the kids, I thought it’d be good for the guys and I to have some time away from society. I wasn’t familiar with the land itself, but I was well aware of the stories about the Hoia-Baciu Forest. It always used to creep me out as a kid, hearing about the disappearances and all. But, It wasn’t my choice for a fun vacation spot, but once Darius set his mind on going, it was hard for David and I to convince him otherwise.

We made the mistake of taking David’s car because, of course, he forgot to top off the gas before we left. But what else can you say about him? He’s the lovable idiot of the group, or at least I thought he was. We didn’t have much farther to go anyway. The traffic was slow, probably because the winter solstice was coming up and people were traveling to see their loved ones. I was glad we brought the right gear because, even though we were in the car, the air was getting cold. I had already put on my wool mittens.

“Justin, come help me with this,” Darius said as he waved me over to the trunk. David followed suit.

We brought a whole assortment of stuff—tents, food, lamps, and other typical camping items.

“Why did we have to pack so much?” David said. “We’re only spending a few nights here, and I don’t want to stay longer than I have to. It’s already giving me the creeps.”

“Just try to enjoy yourself, okay?” Darius responds.

“It’s not often we get to have a guys’ trip, so let’s make this one count,” I said, trying to look on the bright side.

It only took a few minutes to grab our bags and equipment from the car, and we headed toward the forest’s entrance.

Just a few minutes past the tree line, I noticed a light fog rushing over the frozen ground. If it had been nighttime, it would have been a different story, but with the morning light shining down and reflecting off the snow, it looked straight out of a fairy tale—almost mesmerizing.

“See, David? Nothing to worry about,” Darius said in an almost antagonizing way.

The forest was alive: wind grazed the tops of the trees, birds sang to one another, and curious foxes peeked out of the brush to say hello, only to dart away shortly after, leaving paw prints in the snow. The forest was surreal, and I was glad we got to be a part of it.

“Let’s go off trail. Don’t you think it’ll be fun? I can see some activity just past those bushes over there. I can just imagine what we might find,” Darius said with an almost giddy attitude.

I didn’t think it was the greatest idea, but I begrudgingly went along, having to convince David to walk with us every step of the way.

The space between the trees grew smaller, and the fog thickened, making it harder to walk in a straight line or remember where we had left the trail. Still, it was nothing we hadn’t dealt with on previous camping trips, even though those were few and far between. The deeper we walked, the more active the wildlife became. I guessed the little critters weren’t expecting visitors in this part of the forest.

After walking for a while—going up small hills and jumping across creeks—we came across a clearing in the fog. Trees surrounded a patch of snow, almost forming a perfect circle, like the forest itself had created the ideal spot for us to set up camp.

We went around the area, picking up sticks and shoveling snow, making a few spots to pitch our tents. After a granola bar break, I got my tent up and helped David with his.

A bit later, we decided to start a fire pit.

“All this wet wood is no good—did you happen to bring some dry logs with you, since you’re such an expert at this, Darius?” David said.

“Why yes I did, fair maiden in need of rescuing!” He pulled a few dry logs from a separate bag, smiling at David.

“You know, part of me wishes you hadn’t,” David said under his breath.

“Don’t say stuff like that—we all have our responsibilities on the trip, and he’s doing his,” I said, trying not to cause any more dissonance in the group.

Once everything was assembled, it was relatively easy to get a fire going, though we probably should have waited until dark. The heat radiating from the flames was warm and cozy, helping me thaw my fingers and nose. I had always loved the sound of fire crackling over wood—it was comforting, and it always had been since my first camping trips with Mom and Dad.

“Here, take a look at all of these,” David said as he started pulling wrapped items from his bag. “Snacks!”

Granola bars, trail mix, dried meat, and various fresh fruits he had kept safe in his personal cooler.

“Wow, you really have outdone yourself, Dave,” I said.

“I know, right? The meat took me the longest to prepare, but I’d say these are my favorite,” he said as he handed out some fruit from the cooler.

They were little berries I felt like I had seen somewhere before, but one thing I could say for sure was that they were really tasty—almost like blueberries. David had already grabbed several handfuls for himself.

“Hey, slow down there, man. Don’t expect us to go rummaging for other berries in this forest. I don’t plan on taking a trip to the hospital,” I said.

“Yeah, you’re probably right,” he said, closing the cooler.

After finishing setting up camp, we all headed to our tents. Luckily, I was well prepared for my beauty sleep. I brought a large blanket, a sleeping bag, a big fluffy pillow, and—last but not least—my trusty personal heater.

“It’s starting to get dark,” I said under my breath, rubbing my hands together in front of the heater to stay warm. I could already see my breath clearly. The shadows of the trees had grown long, casting themselves over the snow. I was pretty tired from all the walking and ready for bed.

Part 2: Strange Happenings

A few hours passed, and I still hadn’t fallen asleep. I knew it was a bad habit I needed to break, but I couldn’t help it when my mind started to race. Still, that wasn’t what kept me up—I felt uneasy.

The wind howled through the trees, loud enough that I couldn’t hear anything else. It was strange, though. The wind sounded different here, more… vocal. Normally I wouldn’t have thought much of it, but I wasn’t familiar with this land, and I kept wondering what kind of animals might have been out there in the dark—ones I couldn’t hear—waiting for me to shut my eyes.

Just thinking about it put me in a cold sweat and made my hands start to shake badly. I needed to sleep. Maybe the wind would die down soon.

In the morning, after a few hours of not-so-pleasant sleep, the wind had stopped, but it had caused snow to pile up around our tents, making it difficult to step out without snow falling in. Fog had also settled into the clearing—I must not have noticed it come in during the night.

I was the first one up. I hadn’t been able to sleep much anyway. So much for the first night going well.

“Morning, sunshine,” I heard a voice from my right. It was Darius, stepping out of his tent.

“Were you able to get some rest?” I asked as I started getting the fire going again.

“I did—slept like a baby,” he said, letting out an annoyingly audible yawn while stretching.

“So… the wind didn’t keep you up last night?”

“What do you mean?”

“The wind that piled the snow up around our tents,” I said.

“No, I don’t remember hearing any wind. Actually, it was a pretty quiet night, if I remember correctly.”

That couldn’t have been right. It had been so loud.

“Huh… that’s strange. But what about the sno—”

“Here, let me help you with that,” he said, interrupting me as he stepped over to stoke the fire. He must have had a hard sleep, I thought to myself.

A little while later, after David woke up, we decided to push deeper into the heart of the forest. The sky was cloudy, and the fog hung thick in the air, casting a gray, dreary haze over everything.

“This fog is making everything wet and cold,” David remarked. “Dang it—that’s what I forgot to bring. A nice pot of hot coffee to warm us up,” he added, finishing the thought out loud.

We kept moving forward, trying to stay close together, and after a bit we stopped.

“I’ve got an idea,” Darius said. He walked up to a tall tree, pulled out a knife, and etched a triangle into the bark.

“Hey, that’s a smart one,” I said. He grinned, proud of himself—like a kid admiring their own Play-Doh masterpiece.

After that, every fifty feet or so, we carved a triangle into the biggest tree we could find to help guide us back—a breadcrumb trail through the forest, like Hansel and Gretel—though I didn’t plan on finding a witch out here.

We had traveled a good distance from our site and found a small creek to follow, with rocks of all sizes and shades of gray. Every now and then, I found an interesting one to add to my collection. I found a really cool green one along the water. This fog, on the other hand, troubled me—I couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead of us. The fog felt different here; one moment we had a clear line of sight, the next it was impossible to see our feet. But we were still together, and that was what mattered.

“Maybe we should start marking trees closer together,” I told Darius up ahead, looking down at the creek.

“Yeah, you’re probably right.” He walked over and etched a triangle into the nearest tree. He lifted his head to look around, trying to find the last one he marked, then turned to me with a worried look.

“Justin, where’s David?”

Confused, I turned around. “What do you mean? He’s just right here behind—”

Gone. Nowhere to be seen.

My heart started to beat heavy in my chest. “I just heard him walking a few seconds ago. Where could he have gone?” I said.

“David—”

We started yelling. “DAVID! David, buddy, where are you?!”

Nothing. No response. Not even a faint noise.

“Maybe he headed back to camp?” I said nervously.

“Yeah… yeah, he probably did. Let’s go back.”

The walk back was unpleasant. Every now and then we called out for him, only for the trees to echo our voices back at us. I could tell the temperature had dropped; my lungs were starting to hurt.

The forest was calm, too calm.

“Hey, Darius,” I said. “Have you noticed anything strange since David disappeared?”

“What do you mean?” he responded.

“Look around—the animals. I haven’t seen or heard any of them for a while now.”

Darius looked around, then paused, noticing that what I said was true. “Huh… yeah. I haven’t either. Strange.”

“Maybe all of our yelling scared them away?” I asked, trying to find an explanation.

“That’s probably it. I just wish they’d come back, though,” he said. “I could use the company.”

We continued calling out, and again, nothing. The markings on the trees had been helpful; because of them, we were starting to recognize the surrounding area.

“We need to pick up our pace if we want to get that fire going. Maybe David will see it and find his way back,” I said, and we quickened our steps. The ground had frozen over and crunched under our feet with every step.

“Do you smell that?” Darius asked as he turned to me.

I paused a moment, tried to pick up what he was talking about, and… I did. It was pungent and had a sickly sweet smell to it.

“Yeah, I do. Must be a dead animal,” I said.

Darius’ face turned worried. “You don’t think—”

“No, it’s not him,” I said, trying to calm him down. “Try not to think about that. He’s fine and he’ll make his way back, I promise you.”

That seemed to comfort him. We continued our walk with Darius leading. The light was starting to wane, and the shadows of the forest were growing longer.

Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Squish.

Darius jumped back. “Gross! What was that?” He gasped and looked down to examine his shoe.

My eyes turned to the ground, just barely lit by the dimming sky, to see what it was.

“It… it looks like a rabbit, but—what happened to it? The poor thing’s all twisted up.”

Its body was like that of a wrung-out towel, and it had a gaping hole in one side that exited the other. But, most gruesomely of all, it was half rotted.

We both covered our noses, trying not to let in the awful smell.

“It must’ve been here for ages to be looking like that,” I said.

“But what caused the hole? A… predator maybe?” asked Darius, trying to make sense of it all.

“I’m not sure, but… that has to be it. Yeah, just a predator. Let’s keep moving, I can hardly see my hands anymore.”

I lifted my head back up to continue walking, but before I took a step—plop.

Something hit my shoulder with a loud thud.

“Ouch!” I winced as I grabbed my shoulder. “What was—”

I looked down once more. A fox, or at least what looked like one. Twisted and bloody, with the same gaping hole.

“Where did it come from?” Darius said, looking at me with a confused look.

Both of our eyes looked up into the tops of the trees.

“What in the—”

Birds, bunnies, frogs, foxes, and every other animal local to the land were skewered onto the branches of the tree, twisting and intertwining with itself through the rotting meat, almost as if the tree itself had grown through them.

My stomach dropped, and my heart started to drum in my ears.

“Darius—” I said as I looked over to him. “We need to get out of this forest.”

His gaze didn’t falter from the blood-covered limbs, and he was unable to move, like the forest floor had taken hold of his legs and did not wish to let go.

“Darius,” I whispered. “DARIUS!”

He snapped out of the trance. “Wa— a… yeah, yeah, let’s go.”

We started running through the brush, stumbling as we went and scraping the sides of our legs and arms. We were just barely able to see the triangles on the trees, but then I started to notice something horrifying.

“They’re everywhere…” I said under my voice.

Every other tree was another horrible sight. More animals, more blood, more rot. I started to get sick to my stomach, trying not to gag at the smell. My feet were starting to get weak from the running.

“Not much farther,” I said while panting. “I can just about see the clearing!” I yelled back to Darius, who had a look of disgust on his face.

Crunch, crunch, squish, crunch, squish, crunch, crunch. We kept stepping on them. They were all falling off the branches, as if trying to hit us.

Before we knew it, we made it back to camp and tried to catch our breath. I vomited in the nearest bush.

After a moment of silence, Darius and I got the fire started again, this time with more wood, in hopes David would find his way back.

“He can’t be safe out there, with… with whatever is doing all of THAT out there, dude!” Darius said with a shaky voice.

“I know, I know,” I said, trying to make sense of it all. “I know we can’t leave him here…”

I didn’t care what was out there—he was our friend.

My eyes met Darius’. We both silently nodded in agreement, already knowing what to do.

We kept calling his name. Over and over, we called to him, but there was no response—nothing at all. I was beginning to lose hope; maybe I was just a bad friend.

Hours went by but no response came back. A wind had come through the camp, slightly swaying the trees as it went, causing them to creak. At least we got a response from something.

Darius and I finally decided to sleep after calling for David all night long. I was losing my voice, and my throat hurt whenever I spoke, but I wouldn’t stop looking for him. I couldn’t. He was out there somewhere, all alone.

We made our way to the tents, barely able to keep our heads up—either from exhaustion or desperation. Maybe both.

Another restless night. Of course it was. Why wouldn’t it be with David missing?

“Why is this happening…?” I asked myself as I pulled my sleeping bag over me. “We shouldn’t have come here. I knew it was a stupid idea. Those stories…” I shuddered.

My gaze drifted toward the opening in my tent, expecting something to be on the other side, only for there to be darkness.

“No—don’t think about it. Sleep. That’s what I need right now.”

I closed my eyes and waited to fade into slumber, with nothing but the stillness in the air to soothe me.

“Justin…”

My heart skipped a beat.

“Justin… please.”

It was faint and hoarse, calling from the dark.

I jumped out of my tent, my sight frantically darting toward the tree line. I didn’t see anything at all—but he was calling to me. I heard his voice as clear as day. My eyes jumped back and forth, from one shadow to another, searching for anything that resembled him.

“Please… help me.”

It was distant, but not too far—maybe a few hundred yards away. Worse than that, he sounded like he was in pain.

“Please…,” the voice said again.

I rushed over to Darius’ tent and tried to wake him. “Come on, why won’t you get up? I hear him, I hear David!” I said, pushing him, with an almost excited tone. But he was dead asleep.

“To heck with it,” I muttered, frustrated.

I couldn’t believe what I was about to do, but I was going out to find him alone—even though it was incredibly stupid. I couldn’t just sit there while he was screaming my name.

I packed some supplies into my backpack: some food, a knife, and my heater to keep me warm on the way there—and David warm on the way back. I could hardly see anything at that hour, and snow was starting to fall. Even though it was just a heater, I held it out in front of me, its weak glow pushing back the frozen dark, even with its irregular flickering.

The snow on the ground had gotten thicker around the camp, making it hard to walk without kicking it up into the air, but nevertheless, I pushed through.

“David!” I called out to him.

“Where can he be? This… this doesn’t make any sense,” I muttered to myself.

The crunching under my feet was loud, but my yelling was louder.

“David!” I yelled again.

No response.

My pace quickened. “David! Where are you?!”

“Justin… over here.”

My breath escaped me. Not far. Not far at all—just a few paces in front of me.

I broke into a sprint, or at least tried to, before falling into the snow and scrambling back up again.

“HELP ME!” the voice yelled with newfound strength.

It echoed through the forest, louder than I could ever be.

I stopped running. I paused.

My mind started to race.

“How is he able to scream like that…?”

But that wasn’t what was horrifying.

The scream came from behind me.

I froze in place, not wanting to move an inch. The hair on the back of my neck stiffened as I imagined what was behind me. But I dared not turn around. I knew it wasn’t him.

“JUSTIN!” the voice bellowed loudly, causing me to stumble to the ground.

“Why…?” I asked, my voice shaking. “What are you…?”

No response. All I could hear was the beating of my heart.

I propped myself up on one knee, and that thing shifted its weight in response. Then, a pause—a moment of stillness.

“Just… JUST GET AWAY FROM ME!” I yelled as I stood up and broke into a sprint.

It was fast—faster than me, I could tell—and its hulking legs thudded against the ground as it chased after me.

“Keep going, keep going,” I told myself over and over again.

“PLEASE!” it called from behind, its voice forcing the trees themselves to sway as it spoke.

“No… not like this, please,” I begged.

It didn’t listen. It quickened its pace—budadoom, budadoom, budadoom—like a horse of monstrous size, ripping through the snow-covered ground.

My legs were starting to give out. I couldn’t keep this up much longer, but—

“Justin…”

I heard it in front of me. This time it was weaker. This time it was human.

David. The real David. Pleading for me once again.

But before I could fully realize it—

crack.

I ran headfirst into the base of a tree, a chunk of bark forcing itself into my forehead.

\*\*Part 3: Horrible Masterwork\*\*

The next thing I knew, there was ringing—and a bright flash. Was I knocked unconscious? I didn’t know. But I could tell something was different. What was it? I asked myself, and then I realized—the thudding had stopped. It finally stopped.

I tried to open my blood-dripping eyes and saw… absolutely nothing. Just darkness. Dazed, I scanned the area for whatever that thing was, lurking somewhere in the dark.

“Where did it…,” I mumbled as I tried to stand on aching legs. But I noticed something else too—there were no tracks in the snow.

I reached up and touched my forehead. “Ow,” I winced at the cut. It was deep, but thankfully not too deep.

“I hate this forest. I hate that thing. And I hate this stupid fog. I hate it all,” I said to myself. I didn’t know if I could take this anymore. No—I couldn’t. And I didn’t want to.

I couldn’t find David. I didn’t want to anymore. I wanted to leave. “What am I thinking?” I said to myself. “What kind of a friend am I?”

I started to walk, but I stumbled. I needed to find my way back to camp and I needed to wake Darius. We had to leave this awful place.

What was this forest?

Why did it hate me?

I was able to walk—slowly but surely—and the blood dripping from my head stained the snow behind me.

“I can’t see anything,” I said to myself, peering through the dark. Then I realized I had my heater, but—where did it go? I must have dropped it when that thing was chasing me.

“Whatever,” I muttered. It was the least of my worries now.

I kept moving. One step. Two steps. I fell. Three steps.

“I’m going to make it out of here,” I told myself, trying to be brave.

But what was brave about abandoning your friend?

I took a few more steps and then—

“Eugh… what’s that smell?” I pinched my nose.

I looked around, but I didn’t see anything.

Then I made the mistake of looking up.

“David… no.”

His shoulders and legs were bent behind him, wrapped around the tree, like he was violently forced up there. His shoulders and hips protruded unnaturally from his skin. And just like the animals, roots were growing through him.

And worst of all—the rot.

“Wha… I… I’m so sorry, David,” I whimpered, staring at him, not even having the energy to cry.

I couldn’t be here anymore.

I was going back to camp.

I was going back to the car.

I was going back home.

I never wanted this.

I never did.

Never.

I took a step back, looking at his lifeless body once more, then turned and headed back toward camp.

I didn’t have the energy to run. One foot in front of the other—that was all I could think about right now. All I wanted to do.

I saw the camp way off in the distance. The fire was still going. “Did Darius finally wake up?” I asked myself, barely being able to stay awake. “After everything that happened, why does he do it now? I’m going to… to tell him everything. He—he deserves to kno—“

Thud.

I passed out before I could reach the campsite, face-first into the snow. I was finally able to get some rest.

Part 4: The Witness

I woke up warm, morning sunlight peeking through the treetops above. Darius sat by the fire, watching the flames dance across the logs. When he noticed me stir, he smiled.

“Hey, buddy. How’d you sleep? You’re lucky I found you when I did—you were just about frozen solid,” he said with a hearty laugh.

“Huh? What happ—ahh,” I winced, grabbing my forehead. A cloth was wrapped around it.

“That’s a pretty nasty cut you’ve got there,” he said. “I did some work on it, though—shouldn’t get infected.”

I yawned and tried to sit up. “What time is it?” I asked, nearly shielding my eyes from the light.

“About ten in the morning. You’re a hard sleeper, you know.”

Then it hit me.

“David!” I yelled. “I—I found him in the forest. H-he—” I couldn’t finish through the tears.

“Hey, calm down,” he said. “What are you talking about?”

“Why didn’t you wake up last night?!” I sobbed. “I tried and tried, but you wouldn’t move!”

“Justin…” Darius paused.

“Who’s David?”

“What?” I said as my stomach dropped. “How… Darius, what do you mean?”

“Well, you were mumbling that name during your sleep,” he said. “Who is this David you keep mentioning?”

“Stop playing, I mean it,” I yelled, pushing him away. “I went out last night and I found him, Darius. He’s dead—dead, do you hear me?!”

He stumbled back, confused, then walked forward again, closer.

“Justin, we’re the only ones here. There’s no David.”

Why was he saying these awful things? How could he joke about something this serious? He couldn’t—

“What?” I said to myself, looking around.

There were only two tents.

“You hit your head bad, okay?” he said. “You’re just imagining things. Here, take this.” He handed me a cup. “It’s coffee. It’ll make you feel better.”

I took a sip. It was good. Very good.

“But I thought David didn’t—”

Darius looked at me with a blank expression.

“I… never mind,” I said.

I finished my coffee, relishing every last drop, while Darius paced back and forth between the tents.

“Justin,” he said, stopping to look at me. “Let’s take a walk. It’s a beautiful day, and there’s something I want to show you.”

Confused, I agreed and started walking with him.

The forest felt… alright, actually. The sun was out, and it was a bit warmer. Darius seemed unusually happy—but he didn’t remember. He didn’t remember him. He didn’t remember David. Why? Why was he choosing to joke about this? Of all moments, now?

Had he lost his mind?

How could he?

David was gone, and I knew we would be too if we didn’t leave this dreaded place. But something felt different. Had something changed while I was gone?

There were still only two tents.

“You’ve been busy, huh?” I asked as I noticed the triangle markings on the trees. There were more of them now. A whole lot more.

“Oh yeah,” he said with a small giggle. “I got bored while you were out of it, so… I decided to spend my time with those.”

We kept walking in silence for a bit. I preferred it that way—I needed to clear my thoughts.

“It’s just such a beautiful shape, isn’t it?” Darius asked suddenly.

Confused, I hesitated before answering. “What are you talking about?”

“The markings on the trees,” he said. “The triangle. Her shape.”

I didn’t know what to say. Or what to think.

Her shape?

I was too tired for this.

“Darius, who’s sha—”

“Good news!” he cut me off. “We’re almost there.” He pointed ahead.

We came to a clearing.

It was strange—the trees were bunched tightly in the center, and then there was nothing for at least fifty feet around them. These trees were different. Thicker. Taller. Older. Their bark was dark as chocolate and rough. They cast perfect shade, like their own canopy.

A sense of peace came over me. I liked it here.

But one thing confused me.

Why were their leaves red?

“Come,” Darius said. “We need to get closer. You’ll see—you’ll see her.”

Before I knew it, he broke into a run straight toward the looming bundle of trees.

“Darius, wait—” I tried to stop him, to get an explanation, but it was no use. Once he stepped between the trees, he vanished into their shade.

Everything went quiet. Everything except for a slight breeze.

I couldn’t see what was past the trees. I was too far away—and I wasn’t sure I wanted to find out. My eyes drifted up to the leaves, but I couldn’t make out anything clearly. All I knew was that they were a deep red, unlike any of the others surrounding them.

Anxious, I paced back and forth, waiting for him. Waiting for an answer.

“What’s taking him so long?” I asked myself.

Before long, I saw him—walking out from those trees.

“So… what is it?” I yelled, raising my hand to block the sun.

“Come here…” I heard him say.

I took a few steps forward.

“Come to me…”

Something was off. I stopped walking.

As he drew closer, his face came into focus. It was grim.

“Darius, what’s going on?” I asked as I saw tears rolling down his face.

Then I realized—his mouth wasn’t moving.

“COME,” a deep, bellowing voice said.

A violent gust of wind slammed Darius back against a tree. His limbs twisted, roots burrowing into him.

“No…” I whispered, my head spinning, my heart pounding.

“NO!” I screamed toward whatever monstrosity lurked within.

Without hesitation, I sprinted away from the trees—but before I could get far—

“OBEY.”

I collapsed, the breath ripped from my lungs.

“W-what is ha—happening to me…?” I strained as I forced myself up.

One step. Two steps.

Keep going.

“BOW,” it demanded again, this time with such force that the trees splintered at their bases, swaying as if in worship.

With only escape in mind, I dragged myself across the ground, clawing forward.

“I’m almost there…” I told myself as I neared the outermost line of trees. If I could just get past them, I’d be safe—though I knew that was a lie.

“Come on!” I cried, forcing myself back onto my feet—until—

“Please...”

A whimper. A cry for help. Pitiful.

I stopped.

“Please… come to me,” it whispered softly, the voice brushing the back of my neck.

“I… need to get out of here,” I said—but I didn’t move. Why leave?

“I want to stay,” I told myself. “Maybe this is all a dream. Maybe she can wake me,” I muttered.

“Yes… I need to go back,” I said quietly. “She’s calling for me. She needs me. I… I need—”

“No!” I shouted, snapping out of it. 

I ran as fast as I could, past the markings—“please…”—past the bloody trees—“stay”—past the tents—“don’t go”—and finally toward the forest exit, while she called for me the entire way. How I escaped that horrible forest, I do not know. Maybe she let me. 

Even now, when I’m all alone, I can still hear Her voice beckoning, calling me to go back, calling my name.",2,1770564678.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1qzbuk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1qzbuk2/28f_weight_loss_mostly_improved_symptoms_4lbs_in/,"28F - Weight loss, mostly improved symptoms, -4lbs in one night?!","TLDR; It started out in late August with severe symptoms like gnawing pain, eventual difficulty swallowing, and constant reflux, but after 5.5 months of quitting alcohol and coffee, I’ve improved enough to eat heavy meals again with sometimes minor heartburn. I do still have lingering mild stabbing pains when hungry and get occasional flare-ups the next day for a few days if I overdo it on my caffeine or fats. Despite the symptom improvement, I’m spiraling because I’ve lost 29 pounds total, including a weird 4-pound drop overnight (today), and I'm wondering if this sounds like normal weight loss from lifestyle changes rather than something sinister.. Is GERD really this bad?! Is it more gastritis/ulcer healing? I chickened out on my endoscopy (justified it with improvement), and now I don't have health insurance since mine went up $120 and can't fork it out. Note: I've not tried PPIs or meds other than tums as needed, wanted to try fixing my habits first to see if it'd help. It has, but not sure if I actually need them or not...

Details:

So at the beginning of this (August 26, 2025), I was about 187lbs - I was a daily drinker (white claw, grapefruit, a mystery how I got likely gastritis/small ulcer + GERD combo...), coffee on empty stomach for like 13 years (no one told me!). The first flare of symptoms was horrible.

About a month before it started, I felt odd sharp stabs in my stomach area. Brushed it off, even though I knew that meant I should probably quit drinking (woohoo high-functioning alcoholism). The day it started: gnawing and burning epigastric pain when I didn't eat, felt uncomfortably full, like a golf ball was sitting in my solar plexus for 45 mins after little food. Acid reflux started a few days later, coffee tasted like chemical, my throat was sore, eventually swallowing became difficult and it felt like food kept sticking in my throat. Regurgitation of liquids when I bent over, non-stop burping, breathing got uncomfortable sometimes because it feels like my abdomen won't stretch any further. Sometimes nausea, especially if I accidentally had something too acidic (A1 almost made me throw up). Early satiety. Walking too much made it hurt. No blood in stools, no vomit.

I cut out drinking, helped a good chunk, switched to my old vape, helped a bit. Cutting out coffee was the game-changer for me though, same-day difference and it's been improving ever since. I can even have a drink or two and feel fine (I still don't though because I generally feel healthier).

Now I drink black tea. I get a flare up for a few days of early satiety, pressure, burping, very mild regurgitation on bending now if I have 4 teas in a day or have a very high fat day the day before. The only persistent symptom I have now is epigastric stabbing in my solar plexus if I'm hungry or just ate. It's mostly mild, just noticeable. Today it hasn't happened yet, actually thankfully. I had 4 meals yesterday: 2 rounds of chicken cordeon bleu, 1 shepherd's pie, one slice of pepperoni pizza. I felt fine. I was 162 pounds yesterday. 158 today?!? My weight normally fluctuates by a pound, max 2. Four is bonkers?!

Does this sound like GERD or... I don't know. I have a bit of health anxiety, so I try to keep any big C thoughts hushed. But... Idk man? If I'm improving, probably not??? The weight loss is what's kinda bogging me, oddly. I'm a 5'2"" woman so I need to, and it's likely from not drinking anymore and generally eating better... but... you know? I've lost 29 pounds now since this started in August.",1,1770564625.0,GERD,1,0.67,False

# Saludos

Saludos is imagined as a place where community is not an abstract idea but a lived experience. It can exist as a public or private space, modest or expansive, but its purpose remains the same: to bring people together through shared resources, shared dignity, and shared humanity. Everyone who walks through the door is welcomed as a guest—no qualifiers, no categories, no exceptions.

Nothing at Saludos is bought or sold. The shelves, tables, and racks are filled through donations and community contributions, and everything offered is freely available. There is no checkout counter, no price tags, and no quiet calculation of who “deserves” what. The guiding assumption is simple and radical: people take what they need, and people give what they can.

At the heart of Saludos is the principle of giving and receiving as two sides of the same human act. A donation is not a transaction; it is a gesture of trust. Anything donated may be taken by anyone who wants it, no questions asked. This creates an atmosphere that feels less like a charity and more like a shared living room—one that belongs to everyone.

Sustainability is woven into this ethic of care. Saludos is a real-dishes space. Coffee is poured into actual cups. Sugar is scooped from shared shakers. Napkins are cloth, washed and reused. These small choices signal something larger: this place is meant to last, and the people in it are worth the effort. Waste is reduced not through austerity, but through respect—for the environment and for the guests themselves.

Picture a quiet morning. A retired man stops in, mostly to sit for a while. He pours himself a cup of coffee and chats with a volunteer while folding clean cloth napkins. Before leaving, he notices a pair of reading glasses on a nearby rack. He hesitates, then tries them on. They’re perfect. He smiles, a little embarrassed, a little relieved. No one asks him to explain. He simply leaves seeing more clearly than when he arrived.

Later that afternoon, a young mother comes in with her two children. They wander through the clothing section, fingers brushing sweaters and coats. The kids find shoes that fit. She selects shampoo, toothpaste, and a winter jacket. At one table, her daughter helps arrange donated fruit into a neat row, proud to be “working.” When they leave, they carry what they need—and something harder to name: the feeling of being trusted.

Donated items at Saludos are thoughtfully organized into clear sections. Food offerings may include snacks, fruit juice, coffee, and tea—always alcohol-free. Health, beauty, and medical supplies range from soap and razors to glucose monitors and wheelchairs. Clothing for all ages and genders fills racks and shelves, alongside accessories like belts, purses, ties, and glasses. Household items—tables, chairs, dishes, artwork, planters—turn empty apartments into homes.

But Saludos is more than the sum of its items. It is a quiet experiment in abundance. It suggests that when people are treated as guests rather than problems to be solved, something shifts. Shame loosens its grip. Generosity becomes contagious. A community remembers itself.

Saludos does not promise perfection. It does not require everyone to agree on everything. It simply creates a space where kindness is the default, dignity is assumed, and giving is no longer separated from receiving. In doing so, it offers a glimpse of what becomes possible when we organize around trust instead of fear—and when we choose to meet one another not as strangers, but as neighbors.",1,1770564549.0,ChurchHumanSpirit,0,1.0,False
1qzbsy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1qzbsy5/ode_gen_2_sudden_clogging/,Ode Gen 2 sudden clogging,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some technical insight regarding my Fellow Ode Gen 2 (purchased 2 months ago).

Since last 2 weeks, I’ve been experiencing a sudden and drastic change in grind performance. Previously, I was getting excellent V60 extractions at setting **5**. I was very, very happy. Now, even at setting **9**, my brews are stalling and the filter is completely clogged with fines.

**The symptoms is severe fines production:** every coffee, regardless of roast or origin, now causes ""clogging"" and takes over 4/5 minutes to draw down.

**Maintenance done:**

* Deep cleaned the burrs with a brush and vacuum;
* Calibration, I have already performed a recalibration (one click back from chirping as explained by Nik on official video), but the issue persists.
* Checked for obvious debris.
* The grinder is basically new (under 60 days of use).

I suspect something might be trapped behind the rotational burr or there's an issue with the auger/spring mechanism preventing the burrs from seating correctly.

I've attached photos of the burrs and internal details. Has anyone experienced this sudden shift in grind distribution? Is it a known issue with the knocker or the spring tension?

Here the photos of burrs and internal component:

At first I thought I had some inflammation or bacterial infection due to the weak urine stream and burning sensation after urinating. At the same time my ED problems started.

In the following two months I went to my doctor and urologist to do a complete check and everything seemed normal. Bacterial levels were a little bit higher so I got some antibiotics and the burning sensation was gone but urine stream was still weak and I still had ED. Urologist prescribed me Tadalafil but it didn’t help. 

Months went by and I was going crazy, I didn’t know what to do anymore. I found some YouTube channel about pelvic floor exercises and I started doing them every morning. At the same time I started taking supplements like zinc and saw palmetto, I stopped drinking coffee (replaced it with green tea) and sugar. 

After couple of weeks everything was back to normal, urine stream was good and erections were back at 80%, but after 10 days it was gone. 

Sure I started drinking coffee and sugar again but I just couldn’t believe that was the problem. I also started skipping morning pelvic floor stretches. 

Mind that all this time I have lower back and coccyx pain that I didn’t connect with this problem in the first place.

I tried to find solution for my ED online and everybody told me to find pelvic floor therapist. 

So I listened the advice from random people on Reddit so last week for the first time ever I went to physiotherapist (regular one), and after only one session I felt less pain in my back and my urine stream was better. 

My questions are: do I have PFD?

\-Are my tight and weak pelvic floor muscles the cause of my ED? 

\-Does anyone have similar experience and advice what to do next?

1qzbqc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qzbqc1/the_deserted_village_part_4/,The Deserted Village [Part 4],"The thought ran rampant in my mind, growing wilder with every step. I kept looking over my shoulder, the landscape was empty every time I checked. That just made me more paranoid. Was I really seeing things? John Joe chatted away, a distant hum in my ringing ears. I ignored him as he popped more and more berries into his mouth. He smacked his lips whenever I looked at him, teeth stained purple like he had been drinking wine. I walked on, leaving him behind. It had to have been Stephen I saw, John Joe was wrong. He couldn’t keep track of us and his hidden traps.

As we reached our campsite, the little hope I had was crushed. The sight of Stephen sat on the wall mocked me. A cold feeling washed over me. A shout from John Joe almost deafened me. Stephen looked up, when he saw us he waved, and I stopped in my tracks. An urge came over me so violently that it made me dizzy. I stumbled over more rocks to Stephen, grabbing him by the shoulders, practically shaking him.

“Were you up at the cliff?” I asked, desperate yet dreading what he’d say. Stephen didn’t even blink, didn’t even look at me.

“What? Yeah, maybe,”

I felt like slapping him,

“Were you or weren’t you?” I struggled to keep my tone level, but I needn’t have bothered. Stephen was focused on whatever was in his hands,

“I found something else!”

He thrusted his cupped hands into my face, forcing me to look. I caught a sight of that blood red again. I blinked at his hands, it looked like pomegranate seeds at first, but they were glass beads. It wasn’t until I saw the little tarnished cross that I realised what it was.

“A rosary,” I breathed, Stephen grinned like a child on Christmas,

“Oh my god,”

“Literally.”

Stephen’s excitement was palpable, so much so that my earlier concern was forgotten, briefly.

“Wow, you’ve been really lucky,” I told him, he was going to be a star when he went back to school,

“Remind me to tell you to buy me a scratch card,”

Stephen laughed, eyes still trained on his cupped hands,

“Could you go to my bag and find something for me to put this in?”

“Sure,” I was genuinely pleased for him, my body felt lighter at his news.

John Joe took his turn to gaze at the rosary, his hare made him look like a child dragging a big, floppy toy.

I went to the backpacks shoved in the corner, digging through an endless supply of crisps and protein bars. How long did he think we were staying for? There was enough food for a month. In the middle of my search, I heard it again. A scuff on the rocks, the kind only made by a shoe. It was close by. Stephen and John Joe stood in the same spot, deep in conversation, neither glanced at me. The anxiety began creeping up again. I strained my eyes to search for movement in the grass, every twitch and rustle had me jumping. I swallowed, fear like a rock in my throat. I finally found a sunglasses case, which Stephen snatched from me. He placed the rosary inside carefully, then, clutched it to his chest, a wide grin on his face.

“Lads,” he began, his tone serious, “I want to thank you for coming here with me.” He looked up at me, glasses shining,

“I don’t think I would have had the confidence to come by myself.”

John Joe, touched by his words, threw his arm around Stephen, hugging him close like the best friends they were, like we were supposed to be. I took a step towards them, hand outstretched, then stopped. My hand dropped like a dead weight. Instead, I turned away. I watched my friends, feeling more like a stranger intruding on a scene. Something rose within me at the sight, something that burned like bile.

“I-I saw something--someone,” I heard myself say. Embarrassment warmed my face, and the looks on their faces didn’t help.

“Niall, what are you talking about?”

“He thinks he saw someone on the cliff,” John Joe explained, his tone struck a nerve, like a parent dismissing their child’s nightmare. I couldn’t help snapping,

“I don’t think. I know,”

John Joe blinked, hurt flashing on his face,

“I don’t mean to offend,” he apologised, glancing at Stephen, “It’s just…that can’t be. We’re all alone here,” he took a step forward, touching my shoulder,

“You do know that, right?”

The spot where he touched me burned. I shook off his hand,

“Yes.” I snapped again, “I’m just telling you what I saw.”

Instead of replying, John Joe just patted my shoulder. That annoyed me even more. He was treating me like a child, they both were. I saw the pity in Stephen’s eyes, both their eyes, staring at me like I was crazed, and honestly, what if they’re right? What if I was losing it?

I was quiet the whole walk back, glancing over my shoulder with every step. I wanted to shove it in their faces. Nothing but the wind kept us company. Back at our campsite, I plopped myself in my designated corner, arms crossed, I still not speaking to either of them. Not even when Stephen found my empty *Pot Noodle*,

“Well done,” he grinned, like I was nothing more than a dog. I said nothing.

I watched numb as John Joe skinned and gutted his catch. One of the biggest hares he’d ever seen, apparently. I shut my eyes, just as he sliced through something wet.

“The hare wouldn’t stop looking at me,” John Joe said, “Even when it got stuck in the trap.”

“It didn’t panic. It didn’t strange.”

He hummed in thought, “His bright golden eyes followed me, it watched me like it was interested, right up until I snapped its neck.”

I tried my hardest not to listen. I don’t know why he was telling me.

The pale sky quickly darkened, the wind picked up, and I began to shiver, despite my many layers. Stephen sat down next to the dead embers, and, with detailed instructions from John Joe, relight the fire. It was smaller than last night; the heat barely reached my fingers. I sat, shivering, as John Joe hogged the fire with the pot; his concoction bubbled like a witch’s cauldron. The heady scent of cooked hare was thick in the air, I turned away, trying to breathe in the smell of grass.

“Oh, that smells great,” Stephen breathed, “Can I get a bowl?”

John Joe nodded, already spooning it out. The steamy brown liquid was viscous like sludge, white, stringy pieces of meat plopped into the bowl. My stomach turned, yet I couldn’t tear myself away from the sight. The pair slurped up the stew, smacking their lips after every single mouthful. Stephen lifted the bowl to his mouth, all pretence of manners gone as he gulped it down, his adam’s apple twitching. John Joe tore into the meat, eyes bulging as he gnashed his teeth. saliva spilled from him like a tap, his face shiny with grease. The discordant symphony of wet smacking and hollow gulping filled my ears. I sat with my knees to my chest, on the brink of nausea, praying they’d forget about me. No such luck.

“Hurry, Niall,” John Joe licked his greasy lips, “Before it’s all gone.”

He dished out another bowl, brandishing it like a weapon.

“No,” I turned away, screwing my eyes shut, “I don’t want any.”

“Come on, Niall,” Stephen chimed in, picking his teeth, “You need to eat something.” He poked and prodded his teeth, pulling out long strings of meat, before sucking them off his fingers.

“Maybe then, you’ll stop seeing things.”

At this, my eyes shot open, I glared at Stephen, and his nonchalant face,

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

John Joe swatted Stephen’s shoulder, he looked abashed,

“Nothing. We’re just worried about you,”

“Don’t be.” I snapped, “I’m fine.”

Stephen frowned, “I don’t believe you,” as if to emphasize his statement, he shoved a bowl towards me, the contents sloshed over the rim, staining the grass brown.

I gritted my teeth, “I’m not hungry. I don’t know how many times I have to repeat it before you two get the message.” I spat the words like acid.

Their twin looks of pity sent me to my feet,

“I’m sleeping in another cottage tonight,” I gathered my things, ignoring their pleas to stay.

“Wait, we didn’t mean to offend you,”

“You didn’t,” I slung my bag over my shoulder, “You annoyed me.”

I left the dwelling, Stephen called my name, followed by John Joe’s usual attempts at mediation. I stumbled out into the open, immediately barraged by the harsh wind. The temperature had dropped without me noticing, the smell of rain was in the air, but I pushed on, zipping up my hoodie. Their words chased after me, clung to me like the smell of that fetid stew. I don’t know what their problem was. Why couldn’t they just leave me alone?

I picked the cottage furthest away, the only one with a roof, a sinking roof. It was pitch black inside, smelled of mildew, and the floor was just a layer of moss. I didn’t bother setting up a tent, just threw down my sleeping bag and climbed inside. I thought about my nightly coffee, but the only way to brew it was back with my supposed friends. I would just have to go without. That was the reason for my stomach cramps I told myself. Still fuming, and shivering, I slipped away into a frustrated slumber.

Darkness greeted me again when I opened my eyes. It was still night, that much I could tell, but something had forced me awake. It was deathly quiet, not even the wind rustled through the grass. My heart thudded in my ears; I was violently trembling. I had woken up in a state of fear, but why? Did I have a nightmare? Then, my eyes fell upon the open doorway, and I made eye contact with it.

Peering around the wall, shin height, was a face. I thought it was one of my friends checking on me, until my eyes adjusted. The face was too gaunt, too pale to be one of them. This face was more like a skull, the skin clung too tight, the eyes bulged too much, but the worst part was their mouth. Their mouth was hanging open, an empty black maw. Strings of saliva dripped like ropes. I could only watch as a long dark tongue writhed its way out to lick their lips; their rasping breath was a sound from my worst nightmares.

I kept looking over my shoulder, the landscape was empty every time I checked. That just made me more paranoid. Was I really seeing things? John Joe chatted away, a distant hum in my ringing ears. I ignored him as he popped more and more berries into his mouth. He smacked his lips whenever I looked at him, teeth stained purple like he had been drinking wine. I walked on, leaving him behind. It had to have been Stephen I saw, John Joe was wrong. He couldn’t keep track of us and his hidden traps.

As we reached our campsite, the little hope I had was crushed. The sight of Stephen sat on the wall mocked me. A cold feeling washed over me. A shout from John Joe almost deafened me. Stephen looked up, when he saw us he waved, and I stopped in my tracks. An urge came over me so violently that it made me dizzy. I stumbled over more rocks to Stephen, grabbing him by the shoulders, practically shaking him.

“Were you up at the cliff?” I asked, desperate yet dreading what he’d say. Stephen didn’t even blink, didn’t even look at me.

“What? Yeah, maybe,”

I felt like slapping him,

“Were you or weren’t you?” I struggled to keep my tone level, but I needn’t have bothered. Stephen was focused on whatever was in his hands,

“I found something else!”

He thrusted his cupped hands into my face, forcing me to look. I caught a sight of that blood red again. I blinked at his hands, it looked like pomegranate seeds at first, but they were glass beads. It wasn’t until I saw the little tarnished cross that I realised what it was.

“A rosary,” I breathed, Stephen grinned like a child on Christmas,

“Oh my god,”

“Literally.”

Stephen’s excitement was palpable, so much so that my earlier concern was forgotten, briefly.

“Wow, you’ve been really lucky,” I told him, he was going to be a star when he went back to school,

“Remind me to tell you to buy me a scratch card,”

Stephen laughed, eyes still trained on his cupped hands,

“Could you go to my bag and find something for me to put this in?”

“Sure,” I was genuinely pleased for him, my body felt lighter at his news.

John Joe took his turn to gaze at the rosary, his hare made him look like a child dragging a big, floppy toy.

I went to the backpacks shoved in the corner, digging through an endless supply of crisps and protein bars. How long did he think we were staying for? There was enough food for a month. In the middle of my search, I heard it again. A scuff on the rocks, the kind only made by a shoe. It was close by. Stephen and John Joe stood in the same spot, deep in conversation, neither glanced at me. The anxiety began creeping up again. I strained my eyes to search for movement in the grass, every twitch and rustle had me jumping. I swallowed, fear like a rock in my throat.

So, I'm just starting to text the waters, having been single for 6 years after a long term relationship broke up and I have been on one date so far.

I don't understand what is expected of me. When I was young, there was no concept of ""dating"" in my social circle and dating was something I'd only ever heard about in American movies.

This is how it would usually go (for those not from the UK) - you would meet someone who was either in your social circle or a friend of a friend etc. You'd notice them in the pub/at parties/at friends house, you'd observe them, decide you fancy them and make some discreet enquiries. Things like their age, whether they are single, who they know etc. If all of these things checked out, your feelings would intensify, then you would gradually position yourself to get closer to them, with the hope that you would 'get off' with them at a party etc. If you did, you would now be 'going out with them', which is an exclusive sexual relationship, usually leading to moving in together. 

The problem is, it takes me a long time to decide if I fancy someone. I find that it takes time for feelings to develop, so for me, going on a 'date' with a man I don't know feels very unnatural. I'm fine with a quick coffee, but then what? It feels like going on an official date indicates that we are now a couple, which obviously I'm not comfortable with if I've only just met someone. Now, I know that's not how it works in OLD officially, but it just doesn't feel right. I'd feel like I'm leading someone on unfairly by agreeing to a date, when I don't currently have any feelings for them.

My date went OK and we got on really well, but he messaged me with sweet little messages, which spooked me, as they seemed slightly too emotionally intimate for someone I'd only met once. I told him that I wasn't romantically interested, but I wished him well etc., but the whole experience freaked me out. Perhaps feelings would have developed if we'd got to know each other, so I feel conflicted. How do I deal with this awkward stage?",1,1770564250.0,datingoverfifty,3,1.0,False

The temperature had dropped without me noticing, the smell of rain was in the air, but I pushed on, zipping up my hoodie. Their words chased after me, clung to me like the smell of that fetid stew. I don’t know what their problem was. Why couldn’t they just leave me alone?

I picked the cottage furthest away, the only one with a roof, a sinking roof. It was pitch black inside, smelled of mildew, and the floor was just a layer of moss. I didn’t bother setting up a tent, just threw down my sleeping bag and climbed inside. I thought about my nightly coffee, but the only way to brew it was back with my supposed friends. I would just have to go without. That was the reason for my stomach cramps I told myself. Still fuming, and shivering, I slipped away into a frustrated slumber.

Darkness greeted me again when I opened my eyes. It was still night, that much I could tell, but something had forced me awake. It was deathly quiet, not even the wind rustled through the grass. My heart thudded in my ears; I was violently trembling. I had woken up in a state of fear, but why? Did I have a nightmare? Then, my eyes fell upon the open doorway, and I made eye contact with it.

Peering around the wall, shin height, was a face. I thought it was one of my friends checking on me, until my eyes adjusted. The face was too gaunt, too pale to be one of them. This face was more like a skull, the skin clung too tight, the eyes bulged too much, but the worst part was their mouth. Their mouth was hanging open, an empty black maw. Strings of saliva dripped like ropes. I could only watch as a long dark tongue writhed its way out to lick their lips; their rasping breath was a sound from my worst nightmares.

This is an odd story. First some background. I am a gynecologic oncologist which means I’m a physician that specializes in gyn cancers (uterine, ovarian, cervical, etc). I make it a policy to try to not give unsolicited medical advice to friends and family. A few years ago my friend in a group text mentioned how her mom randomly started having “periods again” and that “it was wild.” Her mom’s been postmenopausal for a while. I know I mentioned my policy, but she volunteered this information in the group chat and red flags started going off in my head. I just said “yeah it’s wild. But postmenopausal bleeding is never normal, she needs to make sure it’s not cancer”. 

My friend just responded with “you doctors always think everything is cancer so you can make money, it’s probably fine” and I responded with “no, I think she should really get it checked out” and she just responded to my comment with the “haha” emoji. I just left it at that as again, I don’t want to push too much unsolicited medical advice to friends and family. Fast forward and my friend wanted to meet me for coffee for “something important”. It turns out she never told her mom to get it evaluated and her mom recently had to go to the ED for pain where they found the cancer is now metastatic and a biopsy confirmed endometrial cancer.

At coffee, she asked me how it could’ve happened, that the news came out of nowhere, and they have no idea why it spread. I asked “what did the biopsy show when you had it evaluated years ago when she started bleeding?” And she responded with “oh we never got it checked out”. So I asked why not and she said “no one ever told us it was abnormal, I thought it’d blow over”. I said that I mentioned she should get it checked out but she denied it. I kept trying to remind her about the text and she kept denying. Eventually I just scrolled through my phone and found the original conversation.

Her face immediately turned red and she started yelling at me how as a professional, I should’ve known better. How I should’ve tried harder to get her to take her mom, how I should’ve contacted her mom directly, etc. a lot of excuses. I gave her grace and just let her rant because she was obviously taking the news of her mom poorly. But then she blasted me in the group chat saying how I’m a terrible physician for missing this, how I don’t care, etc. I just posted the screenshot of the original conversation from years ago in the group chat and left because I felt like it wasn’t productive. My friends are split on this. Half say I did the right thing by gently mentioning it, but ultimately it was their responsibility to get it evaluated. The other half are saying I should’ve essentially forced them to get it checked out.

1qzbiyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qzbiyx/how_to_rewire_anxious_attachment_sciencebased/,How to Rewire Anxious Attachment: Science-Based Strategies That Actually Work,"I used to think I was just ""broken at relationships."" Turns out, I was anxiously attached. And so are like 20% of adults, according to attachment research. But here's what really gets me: most of us have NO IDEA this is even a thing affecting our entire lives. We just think we're too clingy, too needy, or destined to pick the wrong people forever.



After diving deep into attachment theory research, reading way too many psychology books, and listening to countless hours of expert podcasts, I realized this isn't some personality flaw you're stuck with. Your attachment style is literally rewirable. Science backs this up through neuroplasticity studies. So I'm sharing what actually helped me move from anxious to secure, backed by legit research and expert resources.



\*\*1. Understand your nervous system is running the show\*\*



Your anxious attachment isn't about being dramatic. It's your nervous system going haywire when you sense disconnection. [Dr. Stan Tatkin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Tatkin) work on psychobiology explains this perfectly. When you're anxiously attached, your brain treats relationship threats like literal survival threats. Your amygdala fires up, cortisol floods your system, and suddenly you're texting ""are we ok?"" for the third time today.



The fix? Learn to regulate your nervous system FIRST before trying to fix the relationship. When you feel that panic rising, try the physiological sigh (two quick inhales through the nose, one long exhale through the mouth). Sounds stupid simple but neuroscience research from Stanford shows it actually calms your nervous system faster than meditation.



\*\*2. Stop running to people who can't catch you\*\*



Anxious people are weirdly attracted to avoidant partners. It's like our nervous systems recognize each other from across the room and go ""oh hell yeah, let's recreate childhood trauma together."" This isn't random. Research shows we're unconsciously drawn to what feels familiar, even when familiar feels like shit.



I found this pattern laid out brilliantly in ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. Both are psychiatrists and neuroscientists who've spent years studying attachment in adults. This book completely rewired how I saw my relationship patterns. The whole premise is that you can actually USE attachment theory to find better partners and build healthier relationships. One chapter literally walks you through identifying avoidant people early so you stop wasting months on emotionally unavailable partners. Genuinely one of the most practical psychology books I've read. The research is solid but it reads like your therapist friend explaining your love life over coffee.



\*\*3. Build earned security through small wins\*\*



You can develop ""earned secure attachment"" even if you started anxious. But it doesn't happen through one meditation session or reading one self help book. It happens through consistent small actions that prove to your nervous system you're safe.



Start with this: when you feel anxious about a relationship, pause before reaching out. Sit with the discomfort for just 10 minutes. Journal what you're feeling. Notice that the panic doesn't actually kill you. Your nervous system starts learning ""oh, I can handle this feeling without immediately seeking reassurance.""



The app Finch actually helps with this. It's a self care app disguised as a cute bird game, but it has daily check ins that help you track emotional patterns and build tiny habits. Sounds ridiculous but it makes the boring work of emotional regulation actually stick because you're taking care of a virtual pet. The habit tracking feature helped me see patterns I didn't even know existed.



For anyone wanting to go deeper into attachment healing but struggling to know where to start or how to connect all these concepts, there's also [BeFreed.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450&ved=2ahUKEwifuKz4lcqSAxV7TWcHHS5bMcwQFnoECB0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1KtHkWuBtO3jhNTsWhztFF) It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google experts that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create custom audio learning plans. 



You can type in something specific like ""heal anxious attachment as someone who keeps dating avoidant partners"" and it generates a structured learning path pulling from resources like the books mentioned here plus relevant research and expert content. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context when something really clicks. Makes it easier to absorb this stuff during commutes or workouts instead of forcing yourself to sit down and read when your brain's already fried.



\*\*4. Rewire the core belief driving everything\*\*



Most anxious attachment comes down to one belief: ""I am not enough."" This gets coded into your nervous system early, usually from inconsistent caregiving. Your child brain learned that love is conditional and unpredictable, so adult you is constantly scanning for signs you're about to be abandoned.



Dr. Nicole LePera (The Holistic Psychologist) has incredible content on reparenting yourself to heal this. Her YouTube channel breaks down how to identify these core wounds and actively build new neural pathways. One video that hit different for me was about building self trust. She explains that anxious people constantly abandon themselves by ignoring their needs to please others. Then we wonder why we feel empty and need constant validation.



The practice: make one small promise to yourself daily and keep it. Sounds basic but it literally rewires your brain to trust yourself. When you trust yourself, you need less external validation.



\*\*5. Get comfortable being the secure one\*\*



Here's something nobody tells you: healing attachment wounds means YOU have to become the stable person you've been seeking. That's uncomfortable as hell when you're used to chaos feeling like passion.



Thais Gibson runs the Personal Development School and her stuff on attachment is next level. She has a whole course on rewiring attachment styles with specific exercises for each type. But her free YouTube content alone is incredibly detailed. She breaks down the exact thought patterns, triggers, and behaviors for each attachment style, then gives you concrete reprogramming techniques. It's not fluffy advice, it's like exposure therapy you do yourself.



One technique that worked: identifying your protest behaviors (those manipulative things you do when anxious like picking fights, withdrawing to test if they'll chase you, etc) and replacing them with direct communication. Feels vulnerable and weird at first. But it works.



\*\*6. Find your anchors outside romantic relationships\*\*



Anxious attachment often means you've made your romantic partner your entire emotional regulation system. When they're unavailable, you spiral. This is too much pressure on one person and too much instability for you.



Building secure friendships and a solid relationship with yourself creates multiple sources of emotional safety. When I started investing more energy into friendships and hobbies I actually cared about, my romantic relationships got way less intense and desperate. My nervous system learned it had multiple safe harbors, not just one person who might leave.



The Insight Timer app has guided meditations specifically for attachment healing and building self compassion. The ""[Healing Anxious Attachment](https://insighttimer.com/sarahblondin?utm_source)"" series by Sarah Blondin is beautifully done. It's free unless you want premium features, and way less corporate feeling than other meditation apps.



\*\*7. Therapy, but make it attachment focused\*\*



Regular talk therapy can help but attachment wounds need specific work. Look for therapists trained in EMDR, somatic experiencing, or emotionally focused therapy. These modalities work with your nervous system, not just your thoughts.



If therapy isn't accessible right now, the book ""Wired for Love"" by Stan Tatkin is the next best thing. Tatkin is a clinician who developed a whole therapeutic approach (PACT) based on attachment neuroscience. This book explains how adult romantic relationships actually function at a biological level and how to build secure functioning partnerships. It's somewhat clinical but incredibly insightful for understanding why you do the things you do in relationships. Made me realize so many of my ""crazy"" behaviors were just nervous system responses that made total sense given my wiring.



The truth is, healing anxious attachment is possible but it takes real work. Not like ""read a book and you're fixed"" work, but consistent nervous system rewiring over months and years. You're literally building new neural pathways and teaching your body that you're safe even when things feel uncertain.



But it's worth it. Secure attachment feels boring at first when you're used to chaos, but eventually you realize boring is actually just peace. And peace is what your nervous system has been begging for all along.

1qzbhuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qzbhuc/how_to_actually_fix_your_fried_brain_the_science/,How to Actually Fix Your Fried Brain: The Science of Dopamine Detox That Works,"Your brain is fried. Not in some metaphorical sense, but literally rewired to crave instant hits of pleasure. You sit down to work, and within minutes you're scrolling Twitter, checking messages, or watching some random YouTube video. It's not weakness. It's biology hijacked by technology.

I've spent months diving into neuroscience research, reading books by experts like Anna Lembke and Andrew Huberman, listening to countless podcasts about dopamine regulation. What I found is terrifying: our brains are caught in a trap designed by some of the smartest engineers on the planet. But there's a way out, and it's not what you think.

# Step 1: Understand the dopamine hijack (your brain on slot machines)

Here's what's actually happening. Every time you get a notification, like, or new piece of content, your brain releases dopamine. Not because the content is good, but because it's **unpredictable**. That uncertainty creates the same neurological response as gambling.

Dr. Anna Lembke's book *Dopamine Nation* breaks this down perfectly. She's Stanford's addiction medicine chief, and she explains how our baseline dopamine levels have plummeted because we're constantly chasing these micro-hits. Your brain adapts by raising the threshold for what feels rewarding. Translation? Normal activities like reading a book or having a conversation feel boring as hell because they can't compete with the engineered dopamine firehose of social media.

The average person checks their phone 96 times a day. That's once every 10 minutes during waking hours. Each check reinforces the neural pathway that says ""instant gratification good, sustained effort bad.""

# Step 2: Do a dopamine detox (the real kind, not the Instagram BS)

Forget those trendy ""dopamine detox"" challenges where people don't talk for 24 hours or whatever. That's performative nonsense. A real detox means **removing the specific high-dopamine behaviors** that are destroying your focus.

For 7 days, cut out:

* Social media (all of it, no exceptions)
* Video games
* Porn and sexual content
* Junk food and sugar binges
* Compulsive news checking

Yeah, it sucks. Day 2 and 3 you'll feel anxious, restless, maybe even irritable. That's withdrawal. Your brain is screaming for its drug. Push through it. By day 5 or 6, something shifts. Books become interesting again. Conversations feel engaging. Your attention span starts to recover.

Andrew Huberman talks about this on his podcast, the Huberman Lab. He explains that dopamine works on a baseline and peaks system. When you constantly spike it with artificial rewards, your baseline drops below normal. The detox lets your baseline reset.

# Step 3: Create friction between you and distraction

Your environment controls you more than you think. If your phone is next to you, you'll check it. Period. Willpower is a myth when you're fighting against behavioral design worth billions in R&D.

**Make distractions hard to access:**

* Physical distance, put your phone in another room during work sessions
* Delete social media apps (keep them browser-only if you must use them)
* Use website blockers like Cold Turkey (the nuclear option, can't be disabled once activated)
* Turn off ALL notifications, even the ones you think are important

I use an app called Opal that locks my phone during focus sessions. You set the time, and it physically prevents you from accessing certain apps. The free version is solid, but the premium lets you schedule automatic blocking throughout your day.

The goal is to make checking your phone require actual effort. Walk to another room, unlock a drawer, whatever. That 30-second barrier is enough to break the automatic habit loop.

# Step 4: Embrace single-tasking like your life depends on it (because it does)

Multitasking is a scam. Every time you switch between tasks, your brain needs time to refocus. Researchers call this ""attention residue."" Part of your attention stays stuck on the previous task. Switch 10 times in an hour? Your brain is basically operating at 40% capacity.

Cal Newport's *Deep Work* is basically the bible on this. Newport is a computer science professor at Georgetown who's studied productivity and focus for years. His core argument: the ability to do deep, focused work is becoming rare and therefore more valuable. People who can still focus for 3-4 hours straight are going to dominate their fields.

**Try time blocking:**

* Pick ONE task for a 90-minute block
* No email, no messages, no ""quick checks""
* When your mind wanders (it will), physically write down the distraction and get back to work
* Take a real break after, don't just switch to another task

Your brain can only handle about 90 minutes of intense focus before it needs recovery. Use that. Four 90-minute deep work sessions per day will produce more valuable output than 12 hours of distracted half-work.

# Step 5: Reward delayed gratification manually

Your brain needs to relearn that good things come from sustained effort, not instant clicks. You have to manually create this association because modern life has broken it.

**The trick:** Don't reward yourself until AFTER you complete focused work. No coffee until you finish the first task. No checking messages until the work block is done. No YouTube until you've read for an hour.

Stack your rewards with completion, not with starting. This rewires the dopamine system to anticipate pleasure from finishing things instead of from avoiding them.

The Finch app actually gamifies this well. It's a self-care app where you raise a little bird by completing real-life tasks. Sounds stupid, but the dopamine hit from seeing your bird grow comes AFTER you do the work. It's training wheels for delayed gratification.

For those who want a more structured approach to building better focus habits, there's also BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts. It pulls from neuroscience research, books like *Dopamine Nation* and *Deep Work*, and expert insights to create audio learning plans tailored to goals like ""rebuild focus as a chronic scroller"" or ""overcome phone addiction.""

You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and customize the voice to whatever keeps you engaged (the sarcastic narrator actually works surprisingly well). It's a solid replacement for mindless scrolling since you're still getting audio stimulation but actually learning something useful. The adaptive learning plan adjusts based on your progress, making it feel less like discipline and more like an addictive habit you don't need to fight.

# Step 6: Increase baseline dopamine naturally (the non-negotiables)

Here's where people screw up. They think focus is just about removing distractions. Wrong. You also need to **raise your baseline dopamine** through natural means so your brain isn't constantly seeking artificial spikes.

**The basics that actually work:**

* Morning sunlight (10-15 minutes within an hour of waking up, this regulates dopamine production all day)
* Cold exposure (cold showers increase baseline dopamine by 250% for hours afterward, not kidding, the research is solid)
* Exercise (particularly intense cardio, raises baseline and improves dopamine receptor sensitivity)
* Protein-rich breakfast (tyrosine is a dopamine precursor, you need raw materials)

Dr. Huberman breaks down all the neuroscience on this. It's not woo woo wellness crap. These are interventions with actual peer-reviewed studies showing they regulate dopamine systems.

# Step 7: Accept that focus is now a superpower (and act like it)

The average office worker focuses for 3 minutes before switching tasks. Three minutes. If you can train yourself to focus for even 45 minutes straight, you're in the top 5% of productive humans.

This isn't about hustle culture or grinding. It's about reclaiming your cognitive autonomy from systems designed to steal it. Your attention is the most valuable resource you have. Companies know this. That's why they're fighting wars to capture it.

**The reality check:** You're not going to ""fix"" this permanently. The dopamine trap is everywhere. But you can build systems and habits that let you escape it when it matters. Some days you'll fall back into the scroll hole. That's fine. What matters is that you know how to climb back out.

Read *Stolen Focus* by Johann Hari if you want to get angry about how systemic this problem is. He spent three years researching why we can't focus anymore and concluded it's not individual failure but a designed societal crisis. The book will piss you off in the best way.

Your brain isn't broken. It's been manipulated by the most sophisticated behavioral engineering in human history. But neuroscience is on your side. Dopamine systems can be retrained. Focus can be rebuilt. It just requires treating this like the serious challenge it actually is.",1,1770563804.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

My best friend and her husband are also celebrating their big birthdays and ended up joining us on this vacation - however arriving and leaving on different days as us.   it was going to be the same week all together but after talking with my husband we decided to try to make this vacation more just us two vs the 4 of us- however our friends still pushed and booked same place and justified it as booking different week days as us- so an overlap.   This all in all was fine with us as these a good friends and we love them and we knew we could make it work.

Here's the fly in the ointment - my friends husband is a severe alcoholic and refusing treatment.  He is enabled in all aspects of his life.  Without getting into long details- I've sat with his wife( my friend) for years supporting her and trying my hardest to get her to accept resources for help for herself and him.   Both claim he drinks bc he has social anxiety and drinking is the only thing that helps.   Im not going to get into it all here as I'm sure you all know about the gasslighting, manipulation, and excuses he tells everyone inorder to protect his goal of getting drunk.   

So for me - here I am going to an all-inclusive with an alcoholic.   Im risking a lot!    But once again- I remained sober the whole trip.   Did I enjoy the trip?   Not a lot in some areas.   and here's why- I'll break it into point form rather than day by day what happened . 

1.   The 1st night they joined us my friend told me about how they had an argument bc he couldn't get on the airplane unless he drank 4 beers prior.   This was the 1st trip in a long time and she was hoping he would be somewhat level headed while she navigated unfamiliar airports and security and shuttles to the resort.   Secondly they bickered and high tension between the two in which my friend told me she thinks she's going to finally end the marriage.  so here I am

foolishly supporting her until 1 am walking around and around the resort together, giving her my time, my peace, and sadly not tending to my husband who was alone in the room

seriously ill with food poisoning.  (I didnt know this at the time.) 

2. Husband is sick with food poisoning.  He's so sick that I wanted to call the Dr bc nothing was staying down.  He was okay after 72 hrs but it was scarey and stressful and upsetting for me.   My friends were empathetic and we hung out the 3 of us periodically for meals  while hubby was sick but I didnt want to impede on their time.

3. My friend - when it was just the 3 of us- would talk about drinks- show me her drink- and drink with her alcoholic hubby.   at one point she bragged about how drunk the drinks made her - how stong they tasted - the colour of the drink and -get this-  **asked me if I wanted just one sip!  oh what about smelling it so you know what I mean when I say how strong it is?""**  My *answer was No!  I dont drink.*  In which she asked about my sobriety and I discussed how I was doing in which she responded  passively "" oh good for you - but its vacation?  you're not going to relax just while here?""  I was so annoyed with her but as it was just the start of the vacation and remained cordial to not ruin my time.   This was when she told me all was good with her husband now bc they made up that morning.   I was like ""over 25 years of fighting and now its ok you are all gung ho with drinking with him

now""?   

3.  During the week we talked through chat on our phones.   She sent me texts about how much fun she was having bc ""everyone is so drunk and making friends "" and I should come down and join them by the pool.   (this was on a sick day with my husband.  He no longer was vomiting but was feeling weak and exhausted).  I told her I was protecting my sobriety and did not want to be exposed to that.    Later that night my husband was feeling well enough to try sitting by the pool so we went down.   Once there we saw the drunk husband - he was so out of it he told us the same 3 stories repeatedly like it was the first time hearing them- and made these rude condesending comments to us that were so hurtful and uncalled for, mocked us for not drinking, insulted his wife horribly, and said ""I didnt even want to come here once I found out you were coming"".  Let me remind you- ***We booked this trip 1st and asked not to do a trip together this time- they pushed to go to the same resort- this was not our idea.***

In addition to this,  his wife. my friend, got so drunk she was vomiting all over their room.   Not only did he leave her up there that sick by herself- she thought it would be hilarious to send me a picture of her vomit all over the room saying how funny it was bc it was her puking and not her husband.   **this was just after my stressful time worrying about my husband so sick and she sends me alcohol vomit pics.**   Again,  kept my cool.   I silenced her on our chat app and vowed to no longer hang out with them

4.  we did manage to stay away majority of the next few days - however I still recieved texts about drinking and if we met at the buffet I had to hear mocking comments about not drinking from him, the exact same stories repeated again over and over, and listen to them describe the drinks in flavor and intensity over and over.  From both of them.

5. Last day he tried like it was his goal to break us down to drink.  We did our best to avoid them but where ever we went they found us.  uUnfortunately our checkout was 6 hrs before our shuttle home so we were forced to sit in common areas so it was easy for them to find us.   we kept calm and friendly bc we didnt want to fight on vacation but we were at our wits end after another day of the same stupid stories (again and again the same 3 stories for a week) with him now making racist remarks, shouting about illegal activities, and mocking about not drinking , insulting his own son, insulting his wife (hahaha they know Im joking they understand much humor) - ya asshole, I'm sure your 13 year old knows you love him when you call him useless and an inconvience. New friends we met - each time he would introduce himself tovthem and point at us and say ""I didnt want to be here if they were coming"" acting like it was a ""joke"" but you knew he wasn't joking.  To top it off there's my friend drinking away with him.

So then it cones to the big explosion.,

,,…,

6.  We are seated by a common area and he's trashed.   We couldn't have any form

of a conversation with him bc he couldn't follow it.   At one point we asked him a question about something regarding a very inappropriate subject  he was talking about and completly embarrassing us bc he was talking incredibly loud about it - I wontvsay what it was bc it was horrible.  All we did was ask a question .   He threw the biggest fit/ temper tantrum throwing his drink down on the ground - ***F you F YOU !!! YOU RUINED MY VACATION!  F OFF YOU ASSJOLES!***

So we yelled back him.  I yelled back and good god it felt great! That was our breaking point- plus we were leaving in an hour

7.  my friend - she says ""everything in Mexico was susposed to stay in Mexico."" then makes a comment about how she expects an apology.

UGH!  IM SO ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED.    I needed to vent.   I plan to go to  lots of meetings to get this out but it sits in my head repeating itself over and over .

WE ruined his vacation?   Us?

I'm expected to appologise?

part of me wonders if they both wanted to watch me break and relapse.   once he saw he couldn't he exploded.

I've written them both letters - ones to sed and ones not to.

Im not longer having him in my life at all.  I dont even want his name on my Christmas cards or birthday cards.

I am considering giving up my friendship of 35 years with  my friend after  being so disrespected by her this whole trip.

Im just needing ears to listen to this and any support or advise is welcomed.

Thank you everyone.

 One day at a time.   Serenity prayers 🙏 ",1,1770563750.0,alcoholicsanonymous,4,1.0,False

I’m a third-year uni student in Liverpool and, honestly, uni’s flown by without me really finding a solid friend group. So I thought I’d just put this out there.

I’m very chill and down for just chilling, grabbing a coffee, going for a walk, or just hanging out and chatting. Nothing intense, just good vibes.

If this sounds like something you’d be up for, feel free to comment or DM.

1qzbf5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1qzbf5o/i_locked_myself_in_my_apartment_for_60_days_and/,I locked myself in my apartment for 60 days and finally fixed my life,"I hadn’t left my apartment for anything except work and groceries in over a year.

Every weekend was the same. Friday night I’d tell myself I’d do something productive. Saturday morning I’d wake up late, scroll my phone for an hour, make coffee, sit on my couch, watch YouTube, order food, play games, scroll more, go to bed. Sunday was identical. Repeat for 52 weeks straight.

My apartment became my entire world. Work from home, entertainment at home, food delivered to home. I had zero reason to leave and every excuse not to. It was comfortable. It was easy. It was killing me slowly.

I’m 24. For the past two years since graduating college I’d been living like this. Wake up, work, consume content, sleep. No hobbies, no friends I saw in person, no experiences, no growth. Just existing in a 600 square foot box watching life happen through screens.

My body was deteriorating. Gained 30 pounds from sitting all day and eating delivery food. Never exercised. Sleep schedule was destroyed, going to bed at 3am and waking up at noon. Felt tired constantly but did nothing about it.

My mind was worse. Couldn’t focus on anything meaningful. Couldn’t start projects I cared about. Couldn’t motivate myself to do anything besides the bare minimum. Just felt stuck and empty and like nothing mattered.

I’d tell myself I’d change. Every Sunday night I’d think “next week will be different, I’ll start going to the gym, I’ll work on my side project, I’ll be productive.” Then Monday would come and I’d do the exact same nothing I always did.

Two months ago I was lying on my couch at 2pm on a Saturday doing absolutely nothing and I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I felt alive. The last time I felt excited about something or proud of myself or like I was actually living instead of just passing time.

That’s when I made the decision. 60 days locked in. Not locked in my apartment doing the same nothing, locked into a complete life reset. No half measures, no “I’ll try to be better.” Complete transformation or nothing.

I was going to force myself to become a different person.

What I actually did

Deleted every distraction

First thing I did was remove everything that let me waste time. Deleted every social media app, every game, every streaming service from my phone and laptop. Instagram, TikTok, Netflix, YouTube, Reddit, everything gone.

I’d tried this before and always reinstalled things within days. This time I used an app called Reload that I found through some self improvement post. The critical feature was it could block the App Store and lock down my devices so I physically couldn’t reinstall anything even when I got weak.

Set it to block everything, then used it to build a complete 60 day plan. Not vague goals like “be healthier,” specific daily actions that increased week by week. Wake times, workout duration, learning time, reading time, everything structured.

Committed to leaving every single day

The biggest change was forcing myself to leave my apartment every day no matter what. Even if just for 20 minutes. Break the pattern of staying inside consuming content.

Week one goal was leave once daily for at least 20 minutes. Week two increased to 30 minutes. By week eight I’d be leaving multiple times daily and actually doing things outside.

Cut off all delivery services

Canceled every delivery app subscription. DoorDash, Uber Eats, Instacart, all of it. If I wanted food I had to physically go get it. No more ordering everything to my door.

This was huge because it forced me to leave and interact with the world instead of hiding inside.

Set up the environment for change

Moved my desk away from my bed. Put my workout mat in the middle of my living room so I’d see it constantly. Bought actual groceries and cooking supplies. Made my apartment a place for living instead of just existing.

The plan was simple. Remove every escape route, force myself to engage with real life, follow the structured plan even when I didn’t want to.

Day 1 to 5 felt impossible

The first few days were brutal. I’d wake up and instinctively reach for my phone to scroll and there was nothing to open. Would try to watch YouTube and it was blocked. Would think about ordering food and remember I couldn’t.

Day 2 I tried to delete Reload so I could reinstall Instagram. Couldn’t figure out how to remove it. Got genuinely frustrated. Now I’m grateful it stopped me.

Day 3 I forced myself to leave my apartment for the required 20 minutes. Walked around my neighborhood feeling awkward and uncomfortable. Came back and just sat there not knowing what to do with myself.

The boredom was suffocating. My brain didn’t know how to exist without constant stimulation. I’d just sit there feeling restless and empty.

Day 5 I started following the plan just to have structure. Wake at 9am, work out 15 minutes, leave apartment 20 minutes, read 15 minutes, learn something 30 minutes. Simple tasks but they gave me direction.

Day 6 to 14 the routine started forming

Week two I stopped fighting it as much. The urge to reinstall everything was still there but less intense.

Started actually cooking meals because I had to. Went to the grocery store, bought ingredients, made food. First time I’d cooked consistently in over a year.

The daily leaving became slightly less awkward. Week two required 30 minutes outside. I’d walk to a coffee shop, sit there with a book, walk back. Small thing but it got me out of my apartment bubble.

Work improved because I couldn’t distract myself constantly. What used to take me 8 hours of unfocused work took 4 hours of actual concentration.

Day 10 I realized I’d been outside every single day for 10 days straight. Longest streak in probably a year.

Day 14 I went to an actual gym instead of just working out at home. Felt intimidating but I did it. The plan had increased to 25 minute workouts four times weekly so I needed equipment.

Day 15 to 30 things started clicking

Week three and four were when I started actually changing instead of just following rules.

I was waking at 8am naturally. Working out 30 minutes five times weekly. Leaving my apartment twice daily. Cooking all my meals. Reading 30 minutes every night. Learning web development an hour daily.

My body started changing. Lost 10 pounds. Had energy for the first time in months. Wasn’t tired constantly.

My mind cleared. Could focus on complex tasks. Started making actual progress on learning instead of just thinking about learning.

Day 21 I went to a climbing gym I’d been walking past. Tried it. It was hard but fun. Signed up for a membership. First hobby I’d picked up in years.

Day 25 I cooked a full meal from scratch that actually tasted good. Sounds small but felt like an accomplishment after years of just ordering everything.

Day 30 was the halfway point. I’d been outside every single day for a month. Lost 12 pounds. Read four books. Built two small web projects. My life looked different.

Day 31 to 45 momentum built

Weeks five and six everything accelerated. I wasn’t forcing myself anymore, I was just living differently.

Waking at 7am. Working out six days a week. Going to the climbing gym three times weekly. Cooking every meal. Reading 45 minutes nightly. Learning and building for 90 minutes daily.

I’d lost 18 pounds. Was in visible better shape. Had energy all day. Sleep was perfect.

Made friends at the climbing gym. Actual real people I’d see regularly and talk to. First genuine friendships I’d made in two years.

Day 38 I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I’d felt bored or empty. I was too busy actually doing things to feel that emptiness.

Day 42 my boss mentioned my work quality had improved dramatically. Told her I’d restructured my entire life and she could see it in my output.

Day 46 to 60 complete transformation

The last two weeks everything solidified. This wasn’t temporary anymore, this was who I was now.

Waking at 6:30am. Working out daily. Climbing four times weekly. Cooking everything. Reading over an hour nightly. Building projects two hours daily. Going outside multiple times every day.

My apartment wasn’t a prison anymore. It was just where I slept and worked. My actual life was outside.

I’d lost 25 pounds total. Was in the best shape since high school. Had visible muscle. Felt strong.

I’d read 8 books. Built a portfolio of web projects I was proud of. Made real friends. Had hobbies. Had a life outside of screens.

Day 60 I hit the end. Two months. I was unrecognizable from the person who started.

\# What actually changed in 60 days

My body transformed completely

Lost 25 pounds. Gained muscle. Had energy. Wasn’t tired constantly. Actually felt healthy for the first time in years.

My apartment stopped being my whole world

I was outside multiple times daily. At coffee shops, the gym, climbing, grocery stores, parks. My life expanded beyond 600 square feet.

I built actual skills and hobbies

Learned web development well enough to build real projects. Got good at climbing. Learned to cook properly. Had things I cared about and was improving at.

My work performance exploded

Could focus completely. Productivity tripled. Quality improved so much people noticed. All from removing distractions and actually concentrating.

I made real friends

Met people through climbing. Had actual friendships with in person interactions. Not just online acquaintances.

My mental health improved drastically

No more emptiness or feeling stuck. Had purpose and direction. Felt alive instead of just existing.

I knew who I could be

Spent two years thinking I was just lazy and unmotivated. Turns out I just needed structure and to remove everything letting me avoid real life.

The reality was it sucked at first

The first two weeks especially were brutal. My brain fought me constantly. The boredom felt unbearable. I almost quit multiple times.

What saved me was the external enforcement through Reload blocking everything, and the structured plan giving me specific tasks instead of vague intentions.

But pushing through revealed I’d been hiding in my apartment avoiding life because it was easier than engaging. Once I forced myself to engage everything changed.

\# If you’re stuck like I was

Look at your actual life. Are you living or just existing? Are you growing or just passing time? Be honest with yourself.

Delete everything that lets you avoid real life. Use tools like Reload to enforce it because your willpower will fail. Block the App Store, block sites, make avoiding impossible.

Build a structured plan. Specific daily actions that increase progressively. Not “work out more,” exact times and durations that build week by week.

Force yourself to leave your space daily. Even 20 minutes. Break the pattern of staying inside consuming content.

Cut off delivery services. Make yourself go get food and necessities. Interact with the physical world.

Give it 60 days minimum. First two weeks are hell. Week three is manageable. By week six you’re a different person.

Track your streak of daily actions. Seeing days stack up motivates you to keep going.

\# Final thought

60 days ago I was rotting in my apartment. Gained 30 pounds. No hobbies. No friends. No life outside screens. Just existing and slowly dying inside.

Now I’m outside daily. Lost 25 pounds. Have hobbies and friends. Building skills. Actually living.

Two months. That’s all it took to go from trapped in my apartment to free.

You can stay comfortable in your space doing nothing and be exactly the same in two months. Or you can force yourself to change and be unrecognizable.

Delete everything. Block your escape routes. Build a plan. Leave your space daily. Give it 60 days.

The version of you that actually lives is waiting on the other side of discomfort.

Figured I'd breeze through security in ten minutes, grab a coffee, chill. Instead? Stuck in line for 45 minutes. Scanners broke, staff looked totally overwhelmed, people literally sprinting to their gates while the rest of us just stood there. I'm thinking, wow, this is what happens when you design a place to sell stuff instead of move people.

Don't get me wrong, the place looked incredible. Fancy lounges, designer stores, screens blasting ads for cocktails and vacations everywhere. You could almost forget you're supposed to be catching a flight. But when it came to the actual job, getting people through security without missing their plane? Total mess.

It's wild how much cash they drop on looking good while the basics are half-assed. The whole setup is built to make money first, move people second. And we're just supposed to stand in the chaos, smile at the delays, act like this is normal.

Could fix it easy. Better scanners with actual humans watching, so lines move but safety doesn't tank. Keep the shopping stuff separate from where people actually need to walk. Audit these places based on whether travelers make their flights, not how much they spent at duty free.

If they can blow billions making an airport ""Instagram worthy,"" why can't the rest of us get a system that actually works? How long are we gonna pretend airports that look perfect but run like garbage are just fine?",1,1770563369.0,I_DONT_LIKE,3,1.0,False

I didn't know what to look at. I was confused if i should just have my meal or look around. After finishing my meal I was even confused if i should just stare at my hands or look around. I was also scared if I look around, people would think I'm a creep staring at them.

So I just went to starbucks. I thought there I could sit and draw something in my book. When I was purchasing a hot coffee he said the insert option for cards was not working in the device or whatever it is called. I didn't have cash and my card doesn't have scanning feature. I couldn't pay, so i just left starbucks and went to ikea. 

There I was able to sit and draw peacefully in my book. I sat by the glass and stared outside. The feeling of staring at something and just losing yourself in your thoughts is something else. And I realized how good it felt doing that when I was younger and didn't have a phone. ",25,1770563190.0,bondha_diaries,3,1.0,False

1qzb7xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qzb7xk/what_does_this_breakup_letter_even_mean_please/,What does this breakup letter even mean... please help me make sense of it,"""I love you so fucking much…it’s insane. This is the most multifaceted, complete love I’ve ever felt…by far 😭❤️‍🩹🧑‍🍼 I loved your analogy of being 2 clicks of the lock away from everything falling into place. I still want that. I don’t blame you for struggling with this. And I’m SO sorry for the role I played in mucking this up. But it seems, precisely because I played that role, that I can’t help you through this without sustaining major damage. We’re magnetic, and I know we won’t stay away from each other, nor do I want that. I’m willing to talk to you about this, but not without (couples therapist). And I think I need some space for a little to put myself back together alone / in individual therapy, as I’d imagine you do too. 

If you can understand what I’m saying, I’d love to hear your thoughts and see what you think might work in the future. I don’t know which way is up anymore, but I know we both need the pain to stop 😣💔""



This letter is all over the place. That is just the end. He blames me again and says he is not demonizing me, but he is. It is like it is closing the door and keeping it open... I haven't responded... I worry that this is how he ends his relationships (vaguely) so that is why all of his ex's are obsessed with him... still pining for him... I don't know whether to respond. My therapist and friends say no. 

He sent it the following morning after he hung up on me saying I love you over and over and I can't do this over and over. That was 4 days ago. I feel gutted that he severed everything and did it in such an unkind way after 9 months and telling me that I am the love of his life. 

The next day he called 3 times and also texted ""Freaking out. I don't want to do life without you."" 

I am so nervous to reach out since he broke up with me (again) and I can't take the pain of it over and over again... and also, I worried he wasn't going to reconcile but rather still need space and then get soothed by me on top of breaking my heart... again... 

  
For context the final fight was about my feelings about a close friend of his who is a girl who he hooked up with years ago who is moving here. I didn't have a problem with their friendship before. She has visited a few times. A few weeks ago she was visiting and they went out. We were supposed to get coffee and go on a hike the next morning. He had texted good morning love... and then I texted back and didn't hear back but started to head to his house... I called. He sounded groggy. We talked about me coming over and he said Lisa was there... long story short is she slept over. Then I found out she slept in his bed... and then it just got so much worse finding out they like to cuddle, he said physical touch was their love language, but that I didn't have anything to worry about... he tells me he loves her so much, that their mothers both ask when are they just going to get married... then he told me they had had a marriage pact that if they weren't married at 30 that they would get married to one another... they are both 30.... 

Of course now I don't know... I am out of the relationship and maybe it was innocent. I didn't think they hooked up, but maybe I am foolish. Regardless, it sits awfully inside me. It feels like a competing attachment figure. And the breakup fight began because he said while I was on the phone, just a heads up that Lisa is calling in a bit.... blood drained from my body.... am I crazy?

Anyway, what do you think this letter is saying? It feels like it is saying he is taking a break... which is convenient since he is going to carnival next week in Brazil... horrible...

Few months later we reconnected and he came back talking about how much he loves me, missed me and regrets his past decision. While we were broken up I became interested in a guy but things didn’t move forward anywhere. When my ex reached out I fell for him again because he was a good boyfriend but I was still a bit unsure. A month into me and my ex being back my crush, 23M, reached out and became interested in m. Because I was unsure about trusting my ex again despite him not giving me a reason, I called things off with him and start talking to my crush. My ex kept reaching out confessing his love and even though my heart skipped a beat every time i saw him or saw his text pop up and he would talk and cry about how i am his person he saw me as his wife and leaving me was the biggest mistake of his life.I couldn’t get back with him because I was already dating my crush and he was a very respectful guy. As time passed I found that my relationship with my crush was more so about being respectful and nice rather me being loved the way I wanted to be loved. 2.5 years from our breakup I found out from mutuals that my ex had moved away and 3 months from then he reached out to me. Things between me and crush were not the greatest and we were heading towards taking a break. when my ex reached out I was ready to get back with him because I truly missed him so much but I found him to be a bit different than before. When he was visiting for holidays we met up for a quick coffee and ended up making out and talking about how much we love each other. things didn’t progress much and we would text or facetime occasionally. Until I found he was with someone through social media (him being a bit different around me when we met up made sense). I confronted him and he told how he had messed up reaching out to me but he couldn’t hold back because he thinks about me everyday and how it might be too late for us to get back together because him and his girlfriend had introduced each other to families and friends and he is now being pressured by her to get engaged soon, so its too late to get out of that relationship. What bugs me about this whole situation is that the night before he was talking about marrying me so passionately and the next day he mentioned being forced to get engaged. I did get back with my crush 2-3 months later because i felt so broken after I found that out and needed some support. He doesn’t know this happened and it also makes me sickk all the time to know that he is now engaged his fiancee doesn’t know how he truly feels about her.

1qzb10j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1qzb10j/how_to_stop_procrastinating_the_real_reason_youre/,How to Stop Procrastinating: The REAL Reason You're Stuck (Science-Based Solutions That Actually Work),"okay so I spent months diving deep into this topic because I was so tired of feeling like my brain was constantly sabotaging me. read tons of research, listened to behavioral psychologists on podcasts, went through books by neuroscientists and productivity experts. and honestly? most advice out there is total BS. ""just do it"" doesn't work when your brain literally shuts down at the thought of starting.

here's what I learned that actually changed things:

your brain isn't broken, it's just doing what it thinks is protecting you

procrastination isn't laziness. it's your brain's panic response to perceived threat. Dr. Tim Pychyl (procrastination researcher at Carleton University) explains it perfectly in his work: when you think about doing the task, your amygdala registers emotional discomfort (fear of failure, perfectionism, overwhelm) and your brain goes ""nope, threat detected"" and redirects you to literally anything else. watching TikTok feels safer than risking failure on that project.

the actual solution isn't willpower. it's removing the emotional threat.

the 2 minute rule but applied correctly: don't think ""I need to finish this essay."" think ""I'm going to open the document and write one sentence."" that's it. no pressure to continue. your brain doesn't freak out because there's no threat of failure in writing ONE sentence. most times you'll keep going once you start, but even if you don't, you've rewired the association slightly. do this enough and your brain stops seeing the task as dangerous.

temptation bundling: pair the dreaded task with something you genuinely enjoy. I only let myself listen to my favorite podcast while doing admin work I hate. sounds dumb but it works because your brain starts associating the task with reward instead of punishment. research by Katy Milkman at UPenn shows this significantly increases follow through on tasks people avoid.

the emotional regulation piece nobody talks about: most procrastinators have this thing where they use the task itself to regulate their emotions. feeling anxious? put off the task. feeling bored? put off the task. Dr. Fuschia Sirois talks about this in her research, procrastination becomes this weird coping mechanism for managing uncomfortable feelings.

to break this, you need OTHER ways to manage emotions. before starting a task you've been avoiding, do something to regulate first. 5 minute walk. quick meditation on Insight Timer (this app is insanely good for short guided sessions btw, way better than other meditation apps I've tried). even just acknowledging ""I feel anxious about this and that's okay"" helps your prefrontal cortex come back online.

implementation intentions: sounds fancy but it's just ""if X happens, I will do Y."" research shows this DOUBLES your success rate. instead of ""I'll work on my project tomorrow,"" it's ""when I finish my coffee at 9am, I will open my laptop and work on the introduction for 15 minutes."" the specificity bypasses the decision making process where you usually talk yourself out of it.

[Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear completely rewired how I think about this. Clear breaks down the psychology of habit formation in a way that's actually applicable, not just motivational fluff. guy synthesizes research from behavioral psychology and neuroscience. the book won tons of awards and stayed on bestseller lists for years for good reason. his framework around making tasks obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying is legitimately the best system I've found for beating procrastination long term. this book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity and willpower.

also check out [The Procrastination Equation](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://procrastination.ca/the-procrastination-equation) by Dr. Piers Steel. he's THE procrastination researcher, spent decades studying this. explains the actual mathematical formula behind why we procrastinate (expectancy × value / impulsivity × delay = motivation). sounds nerdy but it helps you understand which variable to manipulate. some people procrastinate because the reward feels too far away, others because they don't value the outcome enough, others because their impulsivity is too high. once you know YOUR reason, you can target it specifically.

for practical implementation, the Forest app is genuinely great for the ""I need to just START"" phase. you plant a virtual tree that dies if you leave the app. dumb simple but the gamification works.

there's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app recommended by a friend at Meta. it pulls from high quality sources like productivity books, behavioral psychology research, and expert insights to create custom audio lessons tailored to what you're struggling with, like ""overcome procrastination as a perfectionist"" or ""build focus when you have ADHD tendencies."" you can adjust the length from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with examples, and customize the voice (the sarcastic narrator actually makes boring productivity content way more digestible). it also builds you an adaptive learning plan based on your specific challenges, evolving as you interact with it. makes the whole self improvement thing less overwhelming and more structured.

the Finch app is surprisingly good for building the identity of someone who follows through, you have a little bird that grows as you complete small tasks, makes the process less painful somehow.

the mindset shift that matters most

stop trying to feel motivated before starting. motivation follows action, not the other way around. I know that sounds backwards but every neuroscientist studying this says the same thing. your brain doesn't get motivated and THEN do the thing. it does the thing, gets a dopamine hit from progress, and THAT creates motivation for next time.

also, procrastination often gets worse when you beat yourself up about it. the shame makes the task feel even MORE threatening. so when you catch yourself procrastinating, just notice it without judgment and redirect. ""oh I'm scrolling again, that's my brain trying to avoid discomfort, cool, let me try that 2 minute version of the task instead.""

the reality is most of us procrastinate because somewhere along the way we learned to associate certain tasks with emotional pain, whether that's from past failures, perfectionist standards we can't meet, or just never learning how to break big things into manageable pieces. but your brain IS capable of forming new associations. takes consistency and self compassion but it works.

you're not uniquely broken or lazy. your brain is just doing what it thinks is keeping you safe. once you work WITH that instead of against it, things actually start shifting.",1,1770562711.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

Barista (gently): No, I don’t think you're pathetic for staying in that situation…relationship, sorry. I know how once you're in, it can be hard to get out.

…

Barista (consoling): So aside from fear, why else are you with someone like that?

…

Barista (listening, going along): Honestly looking at them, they kinda gave off the gym rat vibe. Something about the outfit… So have they been helping you with your weight loss? 

…

Barista: Your diet too? Well, any results?

…

Barista (proud) losing 25 pounds in a month is great!... (concerned) But you don’t seem happy… 

…

Barista (frowning): Okay, so you gained 10 pounds after losing 25, that’s still a net loss of…

…

Barista (gasps): They called you what? (scowling) That’s horrible! 

…

Barista (furious): No, no don’t make excuses! They shouldn’t say that sort of thing about anyone, let alone their own partner!

…

Barista (taking a deep breath): Sorry, I shouldn’t raise my voice, I’m mad at them, not you…I’m sorry. You did nothing wrong, I promise.

…

Barista (gentle): No, you didn’t do anything wrong, the road to losing weight is hard, and despite that, you're still making progress. That is worth celebrating, you shouldn’t hate yourself for falling down a bit…

…

Barista (gentle): Hey, hey, please don’t say that sort of thing about yourself, please…You aren’t a slob, and you aren’t a loser, believe me.

…

Barista (kindly): I know how hard it must be for you. To be made fun of for your weight. To hear the jeers and comments criticizing you every time you look in the mirror or stand up. To feel out of place in your own body… I know it must hurt, and leave you desperate for an escape.

\[the barista reaches over and squeezes the listeners hand\] 

Barista: But hear me when I say that you are amazing. You are beautiful and good enough as you are. You are worthy of love, and deserve to love yourself. Because you are an incredible person, who has been made to feel inadequate by the world, and the people in your life… 

Barista (soothing): You are good, you are great, and you are amazing. You are beautiful and attractive as you are, and you're doing so well, working through your issues each and every day. Some days you lose weight, and some other days you gain it. But you are trying so hard, and that deserves to be praised.

But please, don’t do it because you think you need to lose weight in order to be loved… Do it because you love yourself, and believe that you deserve it. You deserve better than to be beat around by some gym rat tech douche who thinks they’re better than you and can push you around. 

Because you are good enough as you are, and you deserve to have someone tell you that… Because I’m telling you that, right here and now.

…

Barista (awkward chuckle): My therapist says I spend too much time helping other people, I guess I can’t really help it. Maybe that’s why I’m working as a barista, best place to find people who need a pick me up…

…

Barista (sweetly): Your welcome, my new friend. Now, do you believe me when i tell you that you deserve to love yourself?

…

Barista (sad sigh, but warm): I thought you might not, well that’s okay. I’ll just have to remind you each and every day.

…

Barista (laughs): Well yeah, of course! We’re friends now, and that means I get to tell you each and every day that you deserve to be loved and appreciated. 

…

\[doorbell rings\]

Partner (firm): Oi! I’m done with my call, what the hell is keeping you so long!? I know your slow, but try to pick up the pace!

Barista (sigh, scowling): We were just chatting, relaxing. You were busy anyway, so I don’t see why we couldn’t. 

Partner (scoffing): I told them to grab my drink and meet me outside, simple, clear instructions even an idiot could follow. You shouldn’t have been talking to my piggy anyway, your just a barista-

Barista (pissed off): Don’t call them that! 

\[the partner backs off a bit, stunned by the Barista’s bluntness\]

Barista (angrily): They hate it when you call them that, they get all tense, and feel horrible. And the way you berate them for their weight? You should be ashamed of yourself!

Partner (indignant): Your lying, right babe? You love it when I call you my piggy. My cute, sweet, chubby little-

…

Partner (stunned, building rage): You…did you just talk back to me you little-

Barista (speaking curtly): They stood up for themselves, do you have a problem with that? I’m sure my managers and our fellow employees would love to hear just what you have to say.

Partner (hesitant…quietly): I…Think we should see other people, pig. (mutters quietly)

Barista (Smugly): I think that’s a good idea…here’s your coffee by the way…on the house. 

Partner (gritting teeth): Thanks….

Barista (smug, cheerful): Have a great day\~ 

\[doorbell as the ex partner leaves in a hurry\] 

Barista (exhausted): Phew! That was a little more intense than I had expected, I wasn’t sure what I’d do if they’d started shouting.

…

Barista (nervous laugh): Well, I did it cause I had too. I wasn’t gonna let that jerk keep pushing you around. 

…

Barista (gently): Did you leave anything in their car, by the way?

…

Barista (relieved): That’s good to know, do you have a safe place to stay?

…

Barista (chuckling): Glad you two didn’t rush living together, at least… Still, why don’t I drive you home after work, seeing as your ride is currently doing wheelies in our parking lot…ugh.

…

Barista (laughing): I’ll talk to my manager and see if we can get you some food on the house, anything you like.

…

Barista (sweetly): Sure, all the break up sweets you can ask for…anything for you.

\[clock chime\]

Barista (alert): Ah that’s my signal, I gotta get back behind the counter. Just have a seat and relax, alright? You’ve earned it.

…

Barista (kindly): What are friends for? Just sit back, relax…and remember how amazing you are.

This is a Ugandan mango co-ferment (https://www.falcon-micro.com/products/the-coffee-gardens-mango-fruit-ferment-uganda-fruit-ferment-fsc-7691?variant=56876449431939), and I was aiming for a light or medium-light roast with a good pop of fruit and decent rounded acidity. 

After resting for 10-12 days and drinking as V60 and French press, the coffee is very drinkable with a rounded velvety maple syrup sweetness, some acidity (though without cohesive balance against the sweet), and a smooth clean finish. What it lacks is any real complexity, and I cant bring out the fruit notes as well as I'd like. 

Open to any general advice or insights you good folk might have, but I also have a couple of specific questions:

1. What do you reckon accounts for the big spike in the IBTS RoR? I seem to get it on almost all roasts, regardless of fan speed and/or power. It seems to occur well before FC, so i didnt think it was related, but I could be wrong!

2. Is there any Bullet-specific advice (this is an R2 Pro, for context) for getting fruits to really pop?

\+Very unique mainstory 10/10, even the side story is very good and nicely done!

\+MC is not muted and good design! It's very fresh to see the MC talkable (Same as ToF) Plus its Uchida Maaya!! Holy molly moments!!! Unless i am wrong with the translation...

\+Scenery is superb, its out of the gacha level this is AAA game

\+Fight effect, feedback is very good sound effect, skill effect, ulti animation

\+Character actually have weight! Comparing to movement in ToF its a very big surprise and unexpected improvement!

\+Bank mode is one of the fun mode, hope there's more of these fun mode, it can be fail but atleast u tried? instead of old same copy paste gameplay mode

\+Music is good, compatible with the surrounding and places

\+Unique gacha animation/system, very friendly non 50/50 scam and 90 low pity rate

\+Wild animal can be pet and not just a dialogue pet! You can actually touch them and pick the part its so fun!! (Maybe adding pet shop for buying pet food and giving option to feed them? or able to adopt/buy from shop to our own home? maybe it exist i haven't play much)

\+Annoying bug appearing suddenly and sting u, acts as in reallife bug annoying fella (a good thing, very unexpected, makes me laugh hard first time)

\+Camera filter, selfie, drone mode very details, very smart idea to add these feature (i like taking screenshot) please add more filter/move/expression in the future. Though 1 complain, some of the expression is too exaggerated. 

\+Character design is very well done! Very bold and very unique! But in some places, like Hathor ""shirt"" design is very... slut...I know its a main selling point, but u can always make character like Fadia, Jiuyuan for sexy type woman, Hathor just doesn't suit the character herself. Imagining a shy character wearing a very sexy dress to public, it works yes but weird as hek but still its my opinion, please continue to design such unique and creative character (Daffodill 100/10 is like the best so far, where her skill is cool af, suits her looks/personality an actually well design character than ""selling character"" idea in design)



Negative/Complaints

\-Off course, game buggy, need more optimization and i mean alot more! During dorm keep crashing, and after done the first quest (outside the camera shop) plus many scene (the dandelion domain, pink bank raid) all these places are laggy and frame drop suddenly by alot!

\-Time change suddenly, or i should say the weather? Sun fall down in fast forward motion, unable to enjoy properly? Same goes to the night

\-Car is weird, movement, contact, sound. Movement is laggy, delay feedback it feels like driving a rubber car than an actual car. As i said rubber car, when contact/crashing it feel like bumpy instead of crashing into the wall (your car bumps back when hit wall ??) Sound is weird, the car sound is very weird, and loud af

\-Same old boring combat, fixed lineup forcing u to play what is given, i hope there's improvement to make synergy randomly as like genshin... where u can pair with any element and make fun even though not efficient combo or reaction

\-In autoplay dialogue where npc does not have voice acting, the subtitle autoplay way too fast ""this affect me when i forgot to turn off from previous selection, and the subtitle just went finish, also during non dialogue scene, where the subtitle just appear when u are walking, skipped through and i missed out..."" 

\-Stiff character movement

\-Town is quite empty, nothing much hidden, maybe adding some treasure chest? or normally interactable stuff instead of just fighting off enemy?... and collecting the lucky orb? PUZZLE MAYBE? 

\-Improvement to selfie mode, making zoomout further possible? 

\-Boring same old gacha endgame, where u tryhard a time limit stages, maybe changing to something new or free to play friendly?? Maybe making enemy hit hard while no time limit? I just hate time limiting same old style where i ended up going META instead of enjoying the game again...

\-Console system(Equipment), is very gacha-ish where u are stuck in the grind hell again, what i imagine myself after exploring the city be like Online, Daily, Stamina, OFFLINE

\-when raining, character hair is like water resistance? instead of getting wet, it dropped on hair and become water vapor-ish effect like wtf??? Maybe making character clothe/hair go wet effect as well?? Plus character under a roof, the roof is like non existent, but under bus station works... but common shop roof does not block the rain. Maybe adding umbrella feature?

\-Getting out from stolen car, and getting back in the 2nd time will get wanted? doesn't seems realistic or common sense-able

\-MAKE MAHJONG SINGLE PLAYABLE, matchmaking long time and not a single match, also wanted to relax by playing solo instead of sweating during online please

\-Alot of npc and looks lively... but actually is very dead, there's no interaction (slashing them they just react instead of taking the hit) its kinda bad tbh

\-Fishing system is very weird, i tried it twice, i have no idea how to fish at all, clicking A/D while hooked feels like nothing is happening instead of just praying the fish to get fished out??

\-Idk whether is the game idea to make it like that but the shop system (You can open up your own shop) looks very tempting but in actual its just an afk farm for $...disappointed, maybe can interact more in the shop? Serving food, making food myself for example?

\-NPC shop is weird, everyone is selling the same item type (Consumable for buffs/heal) and inside some of the shop (Coffee shop for example) u can't interact with the furniture, sitting down, stealing non fixed item, playing radio/turn on the fans or something, its just an empty shop with an NPC afk there waiting to sell u items... a waste of uniqueness if u ask me

\-Making story more horror, as the theme is already horror itself... maybe its not suitable for all player? But i think definitely can make things more creepy/horror STAND OUT ABIT! DON'T COPY SAME OLD GACHA BORING STYLE !!! Come onn HOTTA STUDIO!

\-Partner cruising with you, after getting out of car its so weird how they just walk away like stranger wtf is going on... bruh

\-This is not actually an complain, but i think its good to make character other than main character to be able to drive car and other things.

1qzajly,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qzajly/the_piano_in_the_basement/,The Piano in The Basement,"The house was large and cheap. That’s why I bought it. I wasn’t thinking.

Even all these years later, I still kick myself over my impatience—over my unwillingness to just wait and buy a house of higher quality.

Ultimately, I still blame myself for what happened in that home. I could have chosen to leave. I could have done a lot of things differently, but I didn’t.

What I experienced in that house will likely stay with me until the day I die.

I graduated from high school in June of 2006. Like many kids in my grade, I hadn’t yet put together a concrete plan for my future. Unlike a fair few of the other kids in my grade, I hadn’t yet needed to worry about my future.

You see, just a few months before I graduated, my parents died. In the months the leading up to my graduation, I came to terms with it—accepted they were gone.

While I, in my teenage years, might not have had much to show in the way of financial success, they’d flourished. My mother was our town’s dentist and my father was a therapist with a PhD in Psychology. To say the least, they were good at what they did.

Now, that isn’t to say that I didn’t make money. I had a few odd jobs here and there, but nothing stuck. I wasn’t a bad kid. In fact, I’d say that, of all my friends, I was the best behaved. Maybe that’s why they did it.

When I told them that I wanted to major in English studies, they couldn’t have been prouder. My grandfather was writer, and a pretty good one at that. He was a good man, too. I respected him a great deal and looked up to him. Even these days when people ask, I always say that he was my inspiration for going into the English field.

Perhaps my parents knew that the field I wanted to major in wouldn’t yield significant financial success. Maybe that’s why they did it. Perhaps it was simply because they loved me and I was an only child. Perhaps it was because I was—and still am their son.

Maybe that’s why I was the sole heir to everything. Their house, their belongings, their savings. All of it, to me. I was over 18 when they passed, so there wasn’t a need to wait for a certain age threshold to be passed. I’d crossed over any potential line.

The inheritance was mine. I can’t remember exactly how much money I got from them, but it was a sizable chunk for a recent high school graduate. It was enough to keep me living comfortably for a few years.

It wasn’t until four years after I graduated that I decided to sell their house. Between payments for it and payments for room and board at the university I attended, it was beginning to put a strain on my mental health. Financially, however, I remained stable.

The constant payments weren't the only reason I found myself wanting out of the house, though. The longer I stayed in that home, the more and more I began to sense an endless air of hopelessness within its walls. My parents had passed away in a car accident. They were on the way home from meeting up with a family friend when a drunk driver blindsided and T-boned my father’s car.

I never did see the bodies, but that wasn’t because I chose not to. The authorities and coroners were only able to identify my parents by the I.D. cards in their wallets. The funeral was closed casket.

The nightmares were another cause for my wanting to sell the house. Every night leading up to my graduation, I’d have vivid nightmares. Scenarios of what my brain thought my parents had gone through in their final moments. I never did see when the crash would occur, though. Every time that car made contact with them, I’d jolt awake in a cold sweat. I didn’t know if my parents ever found closure, wherever they’d gone after the accident, but I did know one thing.

In the time between their deaths and my living in that new house, I never did find closure. The spirit that was the death of my parents haunted me greatly.

But it wasn’t the only thing to do that.

In September of 2010, I made the decision to finally start truly living on my own. I’d graduated from my university with a bachelor’s degree in English. I’d decided to finally become a writer like my grandfather before me.

The only problem was that writing didn’t exactly make for a great career if it didn’t immediately take off. I did not immediately take off. I’d uploaded some of my writings, mostly horror, to several sites and writing blogs. WordPress was my best friend during that time, allowing me to post many different writings all under the same blog.

Of course, none of them took off in the ways I’d hoped they would, but I was prepared for that.

I’d managed to get a job at a bank near my university. Luckily for me, they allowed me to come in part time as I was a student. During breaks and other periods of free time, I worked full-time. When I graduated and got my degree, I’d managed to keep the job at the bank and kept working and saving for the next two months.

The money I’d made working, plus the remaining funds from my inheritance gave me a—once again—sizable chunk to spend. With my parents' house sold and my room and board no longer being \*my\* room and board, I figured it was finally time to look for a place to settle down.

To my complete surprise, I found a large home in the same town where I’d been working. It was no colonial, I’ll say that much. But for a single person, it  was larger than anything I could have imagined. And it was cheap, too.

As for why I never asked about the price, I’ll tell you. I was a recently graduated, depressed orphan who couldn’t get his writing to take off for anything worth a damn. I wasn’t thinking clearly, so to speak. The house was cheap, it was big, and I hadn’t a thought in my head besides the two of those things when I bought it in October of 2010.

I never got to receive an official tour of the house, but that was one of the thoughts closer to the back of my mind as I explored my new home. One thing the realtor did tell me about was the basement.

“There’s a piano down there,” she said.

When I pried for more information, she actually told me more instead of being reserved like I thought she’d be.

“That’s where the previous owner died,” she told me. 

“That’s why the house is so cheap. Because the previous owner never got to sell it. But, you know, someone dying in there doesn’t exactly help with jacking up the price.”

“Damaged goods,” I remember telling her.

“That’s a good way to put it,” she replied.

She never told me how the previous owner passed, or the circumstances surrounding it. Luckily, or unluckily for me, I’d find that out anyways. But not from the realtor. Just a few days after I bought the house, she disappeared completely. Didn’t go missing, I just never saw her again after that. Could never contact her.

I suppose I could have expended some more time and effort in finding her, but looking back, it didn’t matter then, and it doesn’t matter now.

Just before she vanished, the realtor also told me about how spacious the basement was. She described making it into a study where I could write. Made sense, considering I’d told her I was an up and coming writer and all. I told her I would just turn one of the upstairs rooms into a study. I never was the biggest fan of basements, and the fact that someone had died in this one didn’t quite sit right with me. I wouldn’t be able to focus, I knew that much.

I didn’t know just yet what I’d do to implement a room such as a study in the house, but that was something I’d soon figure out.

Those first few days were ones spent getting acclimated to the new environment. The entrance door led into a large open area. In the middle of the room, a large staircase. To the left, the dining room. To the right, the kitchen. Located right next to the staircase leading upstairs to the right was the living room. And directly next to the staircase leading upstairs to the left was the door that led to the basement. I would go out of my way to avoid that door for the first few weeks I lived there.

 Upstairs were several sets of rooms. Bedrooms, bathrooms, empty rooms that hadn’t yet found use. As I crept through the hallways, I began to realize that this house was not one built with just a single person in mind. It felt odd, having such a large place all to myself. But I’d bought it, so that thought was quickly swept to the back of my mind.

I searched around until I found a bedroom that I liked. Counting, there were six bedrooms, three bathrooms and three rooms that weren’t being used for anything in particular on the second floor. Neighboring the bedroom I chose was one of the said empty rooms. I decided then and there that I would make it into my study.

In addition to exploration, the first few days were spent moving all of my stuff in. The entire process ended up taking a little longer than the few days I explored for—about a week and half. It was a Friday night when I finally finished moving everything in. I’d dedicate the following Saturday to my writing.

At least, that’s what I would have done, had I not heard what came from the basement that night.

Without me realizing it, the groceries I’d bought at the beginning of the week ran out and I found myself without ingredients for a meal. I decided I’d order something and chill out in front of the TV for the night.

I finished my order and hung up the phone. I’d been pacing around the counter in the kitchen—it was an island, so I could safely circle around it without much trouble. I left the kitchen and went to the living room where my TV and PlayStation 3 were. I played some game I can’t remember the name of for the next 30 minutes while I waited for my food to arrive.

It came swiftly and quietly, the sound. Something almost imperceptible. A quiet, noticeable, solitary note.

It sounded as though someone had gone up to the piano in the basement and pressed a key.

Instinctually, I paused my game and put the controller down on my coffee table. I got up and slowly crept towards the entryway to the living room. The sound of the note had passed in the few seconds since I heard it, but the implication of it still rang out loudly in my mind.

Could someone have been down there? I would have noticed if someone had broken into my house and gone into the basement. Or maybe I wouldn’t have. Someone could have made their way in while I was playing games in the living room.

As I thought more about the potential of someone who wasn’t me being in the home, more too did my heart rate quicken. It beat rapidly in my chest, like a drum designed to let me know when I was afraid. In that moment, I was afraid.

I did my best to steel my nerves, and I left the living room. I almost wished that whatever made the sound continued to do so. In that case, at the very least, I’d know it was down there and not up here with me.

But no such noise came, and I was left staring at the basement door in terrified, silent anticipation. My hand hovered over the door knob, my mind still debating on just what could be down there. In addition to the deluge of thoughts about what could have pressed that piano key, another began to form.

\*What if it wants to hurt me?\*

I removed my hand from the door knob, my heart rate decreasing ever so slightly. Why had I even considered going down into that room without means to defend myself? On the one hand, I mentally kicked myself for even thinking of it. On the other hand, what if I was overthinking it? Maybe it was just the piano settling. It could have been rats or some other rodent down there messing around with things. I had to be overthinking things. I had to be.

I was about to turn and go into the kitchen to get a knife when I heard my doorbell ring. Completely forgetting that I’d ordered food a half hour earlier, the sharp, loud sound of the doorbell scared the hell out of me. In the same instant, a wave of relief washed over me like the tides on a beach. There was someone else here now.

At least, now there was someone besides who might have been in the basement.

I swiftly exited the kitchen and opened up the door. I wanted to speak about what happened, but that wasn’t the kind of burden I wanted to put on the shoulders of a delivery boy. I gave him the money for the food, got my meal and we wished each other a good night.

I turned around and looked at the doorway leading into the living room and the door to the dining room. If anything similar to what had just happened to me occurred, I wasn’t so sure how it would go a second time. I didn’t want to eat in silence—if there were other loud noises, I wouldn’t be able to hear the piano.

I sat down and put a movie on. I turned the volume up to a level that probably wasn’t good for my ears, but if it meant I didn’t have to risk hearing the piano again, I’d take it.

 I made the decision to turn the movie off and go to bed right after eating. I’d completely ruled out the fact that I was exhausted and possibly hearing things. Perhaps there was no piano playing entity in the basement. Perhaps I was just tired, and my sleep deprived brain was making things up. That had to be it. I would get a good night of sleep and things would be fine the next day.

I brushed my teeth, put my headphones in and did my best to go to sleep. As it would unexpectedly turn out, I managed to get to sleep. And relatively quickly at that.

The problem was that I didn’t \*stay\* asleep.

I remember it vividly, even to this day. I awoke with a start. For a second, I wasn’t even aware of the location in which I sat. I looked around and came to familiarity with my surroundings. I was in my bedroom, in my house, and something had just woken me up for some reason. I questioned the cause for my wakefulness.

I didn’t need to go to the bathroom, there wasn’t an unexpected guest in my room, and my music hadn’t gotten so loud as to rouse me. In fact, it became apparent to me that I’d forgotten to plug my phone in, as it was dead. I fumbled around in the darkness and plugged it in.

I tried to speak, but found my mouth too dry to do so. Maybe that was what woke me up, an unyielding thirst. I got up and exited my bedroom. The bathroom I wanted to use was about a 30 second walk from my room. I’d hoped that I would be quick enough, and that nothing would happen in the 30 seconds between my exiting of my room and the entering of the bathroom. I’d hoped in vain.

I made it to the bathroom, but I never made it inside the bathroom. I reached to open the door, my hand hovering over the knob, when an all too familiar noise came from downstairs. From the basement. This time, it was even more difficult to make out, yet somehow, I managed still to hear it.

A single, sharp piano note. Then, following it, a cacophony.

I stopped dead in my tracks and listened closely. I found that my heart had begun to race again, and quickly. Once more did it thump in my chest like a drum. I breathed heavily. I went to grab the knob of the bathroom door, this time not to get in, but out of necessity. My legs felt weak and I wasn’t sure if they alone would keep me standing. My hand shook fiercely as I attempted to grip the knob. 

A cacophony wasn’t the right word to describe what I was hearing. It was a proper piece, I know that much now. Years later, after a painstakingly long process of searching, I did end up finding out just what was being played on that piano.

Whatever—or whoever was down there—was playing \*Suicide in an Airplane\* by Leo Ornstein. I believe now that what caused me to feel such a monumental sense of fear in that moment was the combination of not knowing if I was alone in a big house in the dark and the disconcerting nature of the piece. The irregular beats of the piano coupled with the dissonance the song gave made for a headache of an experience. A fear-stricken, mind-numbingly horrifying experience.

I found rather quickly in the moment that my thirst wasn’t so much of an issue anymore. I’d also found that the strength in my legs had returned, if only long enough to carry me back to my room. I slammed the door behind me and locked it. That was one of the things I was happy about regarding the house; the doors had locks. I got back in bed, put my headphones in and tried to drown out the sounds of the piano from two floors down.

I wasn’t sure exactly what point I managed to fall back asleep at. All I know is that when I woke up, the sun was peeing through my curtains and my headphones were out. I could slightly hear the music that was playing from them. What I couldn’t hear, however, was the sound of the piano. \*Thank God,\* I thought.

I got up and went out into the hallway. Nothing.

I went downstairs and into the kitchen. My first thought going in was of how thirsty I felt. After fully filling up a cup of water, I drank it quickly and set it in the sink. I was about to open up the refrigerator to get something to eat when I remembered my lack of groceries.

\*Shower and then shop it is\*, I thought.

I went upstairs, gathered some clothes, and I took a shower. For the rest of the time I was in the house during the morning, I didn’t hear any noises. Not noises that weren’t the house settling, anyways.

I realized as I was going to leave that I didn’t have proper grocery bags. Another item on the list. I cleaned the glass I’d used and made my way back out of the kitchen. For as long as I kept up the routine, I tried to ignore the basement door. It was like the eye of a deity—even if I couldn’t see it, I was well aware of its presence and it couldn’t be avoided forever.

I steeled my nerves once more and looked at it. It was just a simple wooden door with a brass knob and a lock. \*Nothing to be afraid of\*, I thought, \*nothing at all\*. I walked up to the door and found my hand hovering over the knob. It was the strangest thing, it almost felt like I was being drawn to it. I moved my hand up quickly and locked the basement door. If whatever was potentially in there wanted out, it would have to exert some effort. But that wouldn’t happen, because there couldn’t have been anything in that basement.

How naïve I was.

I opened up the front door and walked out to my car. It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining and the wind, while present, wasn’t “obnoxious,” as one of my friends would later describe worse weather. Being that it was Autumn too, it wasn’t terribly cold, and it wasn’t terribly warm either. A balance was struck with the temperature and all I found myself needing for outside gear was a light coat, that which I had.

As I left my driveway and began to make my way to the store, I began to think about the events of the previous night again. I told myself that what happened couldn’t have been real—I was dead-tired and I was hearing things. I say all of this because that’s what I thought. I thought that it just had to be me because there was no way it could have been anything else. Not in my mind.

I thought the house couldn’t possibly be haunted. I thought there couldn’t be anyone but me living in there. I thought it was just me. It had to have just been me.

I pushed those thoughts to the back of my mind and continued driving. Before I had time to think about anything else, I’d already pulled into the parking lot of the store. I wanted to make my trip to the grocery store quick, so I didn’t meander. I went only to the aisles and areas where the items I needed were.

20 minutes later, and I was out of the store. I quickly made my way back home and put the groceries away. After I finished putting the groceries away, I went to check the basement door.

\*Still locked\*.

I breathed a sigh of relief. That surprised me, considering I’d come to the conclusion that there shouldn’t have been anything to worry about regarding that downstairs room. As I stood in front of the basement door, I checked my phone.

It was still mid-morning, so I decided I’d do something for myself. I knew I wasn’t going to get any writing done, so I opted to go to the library instead. If I couldn’t write to entertain myself, then I’d just consume what someone else took the time to make.

I left the house once more and, within a few minutes, found myself on the road going into town again. I hadn’t yet decided what I would read when I arrived, but as I pulled into the parking lot of the library, it came to me.

\*Read a history book\*.

Learning about the history of the town I lived in was something I’d been planning on doing for a while, but I could never find the time. That Saturday, I had the time. And I was going to use it.

I found that I was running into some problems rather quickly. What I was hoping to find was a catch-all history book. Something that included events of all kinds from the beginning of the town until the moment the book was published and I read it. Once more, my problem was that there was no such book. I was busy scanning and flipping through the books in the history section when one of the library workers came up to me.

“Are you having trouble finding a certain book?” she asked.

I turned to her. “I am, actually. General history?”

“Sorry, no,” she said. “But we’re getting those types of books in pretty soon. Within the month, actually.”

I was stuck for something to say. If I couldn’t acquire knowledge about the town as a whole, then maybe I could find some info on a smaller scale. Almost as if my previous thoughts had opened the door and invited it, the next thought barged into my head.

\*The house. The basement. Ask about the houses\*.

“What do you have on the houses in this town?” I asked, looking at her.

Her face shifted to one of worry, to one of curiosity, to one of realization.

“We have one book, actually,” she said, getting up. “It isn’t here on the floor, though. Want me to get it for you?”

“I’d appreciate it, thank you,” I replied.

She left and I went to stand by the table at which I planned to sit and read. As I stood, several thoughts flooded through my head. I wondered if I would find out anything regarding the sounds I heard. I began to wonder if it really was my imagination. I didn’t know what results reading the book would yield, but as the librarian brought and handed it over to me with a simple “enjoy!”, I knew I’d get some form of answers.

I sat down at the table and began to flip through the book. I first checked the date on the book. To my surprise, it had been published only a year prior to when I read it.

I skimmed the pages that had writings of when the first houses were built in the town, writings of the materials and types of houses built, and examples of notable events that occurred within some of the houses.

An ache struck my chest as I flipped to a page about two-thirds of the way through the book. I flipped to the next page and found a picture of the current house I was living in, albeit a lot older—technically younger—looking. I looked near the bottom of the page and found that the house had been built years before I moved into it—about six to be exact. Another thing I noted was the fates of the occupants in the house.

According to witness testimonies and police reports as well as information disclosed by the constantly changing realtors, every single time the house was occupied, it was by a single person. The first owner of the house was not mentally stable, as I came to find out. The first owner of the house was reported to have hanged themselves in an upstairs bedroom. The house no longer had an owner, and was therefore put up for sale. This happened in late 2004.

The next owner of the house took their own life as well. But they didn’t do it because of mental instability. Not mental instability that wasn’t already pre-established, anyways. They didn’t do it because they were depressed. They did it because, according to neighbors and close friends, in the final few days before they ended their life, they reported seeing scattered visions of a hanging man in one of the upstairs bedrooms.

I wasn’t sure why they chose the method they chose, of all the ways. This individual chose to drown themselves in one of the upstairs bathrooms. The house once again went on sale, no one the wiser to what was happening within the walls. This occurred in mid 2005.

The next owner of the house reportedly displayed similar behaviors to the previous one. Madness, paranoia, anxiety and a never ending stream of fear. They shot themselves in the kitchen. According to one of their friends, the only thing they were saying leading up to their death was something about someone drowning in the bathroom. But, when they attempted to show it to someone else, it was like the drowned individual had never been there in the first place. This particular owner passed in early 2006.

The next owner, as I suspected, complained about seeing visions in their kitchen of a woman shooting herself. The sight itself wasn’t what drove the next owner to poison their own food and eat it. No, what drove them to end their own life in such a gruesome manner was the constant ear-ringing gunshots they heard. Just hours before they took their own life, they’d had a friend over. The friend left because the owner was frantically asking “you can’t hear that?”

The friend only wanted to get help for the owner, but it was too late. By the time the friend returned with others and some help, the owner had taken their own life via poison. This happened in 2007.

The last and most recent owner came up next. I was technically the most recent owner of the house, but this listed all owners who’d taken their own life. The previous owner before me, who bought the house in 2008, and was a master piano player, complained about hearing and seeing things in the dining room.

What surprised me the most about this particular owner was the amount of time they stayed in the house for. Every other owner stayed in the house for, at most, a year. This owner only lived in the house for three months.

As was customary with every other owner, she, around two months into living in the house, began to complain about the sounds and sights in the dining room. According to friends and family, this woman would play the piano in an attempt to cope with her problems.

Reading the next passage, I was saddened to find that the problems were too much for her. Too much, as were the problems for everyone else.

She was found by her mother in the early hours of the morning, hunched over the piano, two deep gashes in her wrists. Next to her, streaked with blood, was a note. The full contents weren’t laid out on the page, but the last part was. It scared me.

\*I can’t handle it anymore. The man in the dining room, he’s poisoning himself. He’s killing himself and I can’t handle it. I can’t handle the sounds. I can’t handle the visions. Therapy won’t help. Nothing helps. I think I’m going to do it today. I think I’m going to get myself some proper help. I just wish I could come to terms with what’s happening to me.\*

I set the book down and closed it. I felt hot. I’d began to sweat a little, but I knew that was due to my increasing heart rate as well as the increasing pressure of the stress on my mind. Everyone who had owned that house before me ended their lives. Ended their lives after seeing and hearing visions of those who came before them.

I felt dizzy and I got up from the table. I began to walk slowly towards the exit of the library. I needed some air. It looked to be getting dark outside.

\*What the hell?\*

The thought quickly vanished from my mind. I needed to see what time it was. I went to get my phone out of my pocket and I mentally kicked myself.

My phone wasn’t in my pocket.

I started moving faster. I had to check and see if it was in my car. As I unlocked the vehicle and slid into the driver’s seat, I looked around.

I mentally kicked myself again and slammed the door before punching the steering wheel multiple times. I’d left my cellphone at home. I was going to have to go back and get it.

I didn’t want to go anywhere near that house at this point. If the pattern were to continue repeating itself, I’d end up going mad and I would take my own life. I didn’t want that.

I didn’t want to die.

I drove a little faster than I should have, but through some force of sheer luck, I didn’t get pulled over once. Though, maybe I should have. I pulled into my driveway and found the house to be dark. This didn’t scare me too badly, as I hadn’t turned any of them on before I left. What did scare me was when I walked in and found the basement door to be unlocked and opened.

What the hell had happened in here for it to be open? Was it a ghost? Could a ghost physically interact with something? At that point, I had many questions, but all I wanted to do was get my phone and get out of there.

I sprinted upstairs to my room and found my phone. I grabbed it, but had to question the manner in which I’d found it. My phone was set right in the middle of my bed, screen down, my headphones wrapped up nicely right next to them. Paying it just enough mind to think about it later, I grabbed both and turned around to leave my room when I heard it. This time, the sound rang out uninhibited and unabated.

Once more, the haunting, dissonant sound of Leo Ornstein’s \*Suicide in an Airplane\* rang out from the basement. I froze in place and remained that way for a few seconds. The disjointed, arrhythmic melody was beautifully terrifying. It took me a good few seconds to realize the effect it was having on me. I broke out of my trance and bounded for the stairs. Reaching the base of the steps, I turned to face the basement door.

Still, to this day, I regret doing what I did next. I had not a single reason to go investigate the door. I didn’t have a reason to be any more curious than I’d been hours, days before. I had no reason to do what I did next, yet, in those following seconds, I found myself making quick strides toward the basement door. I found myself on the third step of the staircase when I stopped.

I stared down the mouth of darkness, Leo Ornstein’s haunting piano piece ringing out from the unknown piano player. Except, I knew who it was. I knew that, down in the basement, the previous owner of the house awaited me with open, bloody arms. In the short time I was living in that house, I hadn’t even thought of going into the basement. Just never occurred to me.

I’d never considered going in prior to that night, but just then, something, some strange thing was drawing me to it. Still, I fought the urge. I hadn’t gone down before, and I wouldn’t be going down now.

Steeling myself, I turned around and began to make my way back up the stairs. Just before my foot left the first step, the door slammed. It could have been the wind, it could have been any force of nature. It could have just been the way the door worked. But I knew what really happened.

It wasn’t the wind that closed the door.

The door itself slammed with so much ferocity and force that it blindsided me. I expected to take it and be fine. I’d just have to open the door and then I’d be free. But that’s not what happened. No, the door hit me in the face with such a level of force that I couldn’t do anything but stand there, take it, and fall.

And fall I did. All the way down the stairs. I hadn’t received any life threatening injuries on my fall, but I knew that, should I make it out of the basement, I’d have some bruises on my body the next day. Bruises, however, were near the bottom of the list of things I needed to worry about in that moment.

Clearly now, I could hear the haunting melody being played from the piano. This time, it almost ached. It felt as though excruciating levels of pressure were being applied to the insides of my ears. My eardrums felt like they were going to \*burst\*.

I groaned, searching for ground to prop myself up on. The cold, concrete floor of the basement did nothing to soothe my pain inflicted from the fall. I’d landed back-up with my stomach pressing against the floor.

Gathering all the strength I could manage, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my phone. The kind of phone I had at the time didn’t have a flashlight, so I had to use the actual screen as a light source. I was mostly using it to look for something, anything I could use to get out of there. However, out of curiosity, and the need to know what was making the noise, I raised the phone up and in the direction of where I imagined the piano noises to be coming from. It was a shot in the dark, as I felt like the sounds were coming from every direction. A maelstrom of discordant, sharp piano notes.

I tried to mentally brace myself for what I would see when the light landed on the piano, but no amount of nerve-steeling or mental shielding could have prepared me for what I saw.

There, sitting on the piano bench, gaping wrist wounds weeping blood onto the floor, was the pianist that’d haunted me for the last couple of days. She whipped blood over the pristine white keys of the piano and the surrounding area as she played with a fervor unbecoming of a suffered spirit forever destined to remain in this accursed house.

I tried to stifle the scream I knew was coming, but it was no use. This wasn’t something I could just look at and then not care about for the rest of my day. Until that point in my life, I had not experienced one thing that equaled a fraction of the unbridled, primal fear I was feeling in my gut. It felt as though someone had dropped an ice cold rock in the pit of my stomach.

She must have noticed the light on her, because a short time after I had bathed her in it, she stopped playing the piano. Without warning, without anything that could have indicated that she was to stop. She halted, completely and quietly. Her face was the first thing I saw, as she turned to look me dead in the eyes.

The pit in my stomach grew larger and I felt something catch in my throat. Whether it was my fight-or-flight kicking in, I didn’t know. What I was aware of, however, was the increasingly quick rate at which my heart began to beat. I felt waves of fear wash over me again and again.

Then, she got up from the bench. The sounds of bare feet slapping against wet, bloody concrete terrified me, but as she approached closer and closer, something else came to me. The fear remained in my body as strong as it had ever been, and hopefully as strong as it would ever be. But there was something else. A sudden surge of energy, a burst. Something I could use. Something that would help me get out of that basement and out of that damned house.

I used that burst of energy to get up and turn around. Just before I made it to the stairs, I felt her grab my arm. I was about to whirl around and try to get her off of me when the physical properties of blood did all the work for me. Just as fast as she’d managed to grip onto my forearm, the slippery blood caused her to lose her grip and I escaped from her bloody, one handed grasp.

As I bounded up the basement stairs, I didn’t think of whether she’d be able to get out or not, but that was far from the most important thing on my mind. I reached the top of the stairs and opened the door. To my surprise, it wasn’t locked, but I wasn’t going to complain. I slammed it behind me with enough force to send small cracks through the door and cause it to splinter slightly.

I wasn’t taking any time to rest. I sprinted to the kitchen, grabbed a dish towel, turned the stove on, and lit the dish towel ablaze. I made my way back out to the main area and threw the flaming rag. Just then, I heard the basement door crash open, but I was already running through the open front doorway.

Now, the sounds of the piano weren’t anywhere to be found. As I got in and started my car, I found the reason for that.

Looking through the open front door, I could just barely make it out. But I knew what I was looking at. Dripping blood onto the floor, smile on her face, was the woman playing the piano. As the spreading flames licked at the stairs and the doorframe of the basement, she turned around and began to walk back down the stairs. Behind her, the door slammed and the flames began lapping at it more fiercely.

I didn’t care about that, though. I cared about getting away from that house as quickly as possible. And as far away as possible. I didn’t want a thing to do with that place anymore. As a matter of fact, I decided that night that I didn’t want anything to do with that town in general. As I drove, I remembered the blood she’d gotten on me. I went to find something to wipe it off on when I actually got a good look at my arm.

There was nothing on it but a slowly forming bruise from my fall. I accepted it and kept my eyes on the road.

I’m not sure how long I drove for, only that I ended up in Davenport, Iowa, nearly 24 hours later. I checked into a shitty motel and watched the news in Vermont for a few minutes. They’d covered the burning down of that house from late in the night until right then when I watched it. Strangely enough, they treated it as though it was an accident. It wasn’t, but I suppose there wasn’t any evidence left to say otherwise.

After a good night’s sleep, I decided to actually look around town for a bit.

I eventually got acclimated to the town of Davenport, Iowa. I got a decent job, coincidentally, at another bank. I managed to save up enough and buy another house, albeit years after the event. The new house was a lot smaller than the previous one. Or is, I suppose, since I still live there. When I bought said house, it was under the specific condition that it did \*not\* have a basement.

Another thing I was worried about was living alone, but as of eight and three years ago, 2018 and 2023, I don’t have to worry about that anymore.

It’s just me, my wife, and our daughter in this house now. I work, spend time with my family, and I write when I can. It’s a good life, one I never thought I’d have. It certainly wasn’t what I was thinking about in that basement. But I don’t willingly think about the basement or that house anymore. Not willingly.

I’ve never told my wife about the Suicide House or the phantom piano player, and I don’t think I plan on doing so. Not for a while, at least. Maybe I’ll tell her and my daughter when she’s older. We’re living a good life, and I don’t want to tarnish that.

It’s not all perfect, though.

You see, I may have physically escaped the house, but even 16 years later, the memories of what happened in that place still plague me. I still dream about my parents and the car crash they got in, but they aren’t the only ones.

I dream about the man that hanged himself in one of the upstairs bedrooms. I dream about the woman who drowned herself in an upstairs bathroom. I dream of the woman who shot herself in the kitchen. I dream of the man who poisoned himself in the dining room. And I always dream about the woman in the basement who carved into her wrists the wounds of death. I dream of every single one.

They don’t scare me, not as much as they did anymore. They may not have come to terms with their lives and the subsequent ending of those lives, but I have.

Call me selfish, call me whatever you want, but that’s the truth. Still do I dream about the occupants of that house, but I don’t run in fear. I comfort them, tell them that it wasn’t their fault, that I care.

The house is gone, but the memories remain. The dreams, I can deal with those. But, there’s something else that happens to me. It isn’t nightly, but it happens just frequently enough that there’s consistency in its occurrence.

Sometimes, I’ll wake up real early in the morning. I don’t know what causes me to awaken, but every time, without fail, I go downstairs.

If the house is quiet, and I concentrate hard enough, I can just barely hear it.

Somewhere below me, I can faintly hear the haunting, dissonant chords of Leo Ornstein’s \*Suicide in an Airplane\*.",2,1770561515.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

# Surveys / Receipts

**Google Rewards (**[Non-ref; website](https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/)**)**

I was recommended this app in one of my posts last year, and since then have been answering the super short surveys every time they pop up.

They are generally about shops I have visited and whether I made a purchase, but recently have started getting questions about Google searches too (one of which paid £1.20!)

They have also introduced receipt scanning where they will ask you to upload receipts for stores you have visited (completely random, and some I haven't been in) paying £0.01 if you don't have a receipt/ didn't visit or up to £0.30 if you upload one.

The earnings can only be redeemed for Google Play credit on Android but still worthwhile!

# *Costs

Costs incurred during the month were as follows:

* Mileage for mystery shopping (@ 45p per mile): £173.25 - As I'm sure you can imagine, completing nearly 100 mystery shopping tasks took quite a lot of miles (!)
* Parking costs for mystery shopping: £2.00

All 3 of us go the same uni. Ben and I met randomly when I was on a family trip. We didn't really talk during the trip but when classes started back up, he started adding me on socials, waiting outside of my classes to talk to me, asking if we could grab a coffee, etc. I didn't like him back for I'm not even sure what reason but I turned down all his advances. This went on for about a year till he sorta gave up on me a few months back. I should mention he does have a girlfriend now and I know that because we're still IG mutuals.

Alex and Ben are pretty close and anytime I see them on campus they're together and I got to know about him in the first place from Ben's social media. Alex, I guess saw me on campus or something, has made it known to me that he's interested and wants to pursue something long term with me. It's funny cause I've never talked to him before but he's one of those people I would always see on campus. If you're in uni, yk what I'm talking about.

Idk yet if I like Alex for sure but he is kind of my type. I've told him I would prefer to be friends first and seeing if we connect rather than jumping straight into labelling it as a relationship. To which he reacted positively. This was a few days ago and we're only starting to ""talk"" regularly about the usual stuff just to get familiar but before this goes any further, I'm not sure if I should pursue this in fact. Idk if Ben has told him anything about me or if Alex knows about Ben liking me before or should I tell him now? One of the times Alex came to talk to me he was with Ben, so I'm assuming Ben knows about Alex's moves and doesn't care.

Industrial expansion continues to absorb the bulk of attention, yet the balance-of-payments arithmetic remains unchanged: Brazil still needs foreign exchange that does not arrive only through coffee and minerals, and it needs employment growth that does not rely exclusively on heavy industry cycles. The tourism and convention economy is treated internally as a service export line with unusually favorable characteristics for Brazil’s present stage, since it converts existing assets into foreign receipts, absorbs labor across skill levels, and distributes activity geographically in a way that reduces political strain around concentration in the Southeast. The program is designed to monetize what the State is already building in transport, urban services, and national image, while avoiding the failure mode of “tourism promotion” that produces brochures without beds, airports without schedules, and foreign visitors who never return.

The plan is executed as a coordination and standards problem rather than a publicity campaign. Tourism revenues depend on reliability, hygiene, predictable transport, pricing transparency, and a basic sense that visitors can move without administrative friction. Those conditions require joint action across civil aviation, ports, municipal services, policing routines, hotel finance, and currency exchange rules. The Planning Commission therefore treats this as a production system with a measurable output, namely nights sold to foreign visitors and conventions hosted with repeat bookings, and it assigns responsibilities accordingly.

A National Tourism and Conventions Board is established as the operating center, with a mandate that is deliberately narrow. It does not build projects directly, and it does not become another general planning ministry in miniature. Its role is to issue standards, align credit and procurement, coordinate schedules with airlines and port authorities, manage external promotion through Itamaraty, and maintain a small statistical and inspection capacity that turns anecdotes into actionable metrics. The Board’s core discipline is conditionality. Access to hotel finance, convention grants, and route support is tied to compliance with service standards, verified sanitation, transparent pricing, and minimum staffing and training requirements, so that public support does not subsidize low-quality capacity that damages national reputation.

The first execution pillar is access and circulation. Brazil’s tourism problem is not an absence of attractions; it is the cost and uncertainty of reaching them, and the risk of arriving to find basic services inconsistent. Civil aviation receives the priority role for foreign entry and domestic circuits, with route planning coordinated around Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Recife, Salvador, and Belém as the initial hubs, while secondary nodes are added only when runway condition, navigation aids, and regular schedules can be sustained without improvisation. Port authorities are instructed to treat passenger handling and customs throughput as an economic activity rather than a ceremonial inconvenience. This includes dedicated inspection lanes for visitors, predictable clearing hours, and a strict separation between revenue collection and discretionary harassment, since petty extraction at points of entry converts directly into reputational loss. Overland and coastal integration is treated as the second layer, using the highway and coastal shipping improvements already under execution to make multi-city circuits feasible rather than exhausting.

The second pillar is hotel, venue, and service capacity, built through finance design rather than direct state construction. Caixa and BNDE open a dedicated line for hotels, guesthouses, and convention facilities, structured to favor standardized building designs and phased delivery. Financing prioritizes projects that attach to transport nodes, employment centers, and planned urban services, since isolated prestige hotels create imported dependency and seasonal fragility. Procurement rules deliberately link the program to domestic industry: furniture, textiles, ceramics, glassware, refrigeration equipment, air handling, and packaged food supply are sourced domestically where standards permit, using multi-year purchasing commitments to anchor the relevant industries. This turns tourism capacity into a quiet industrial multiplier, strengthening packaging, cold-chain equipment, light electrical goods, and standardized construction inputs without presenting the effort as industrial policy in public messaging.

Convention capacity is treated as the most stable subsegment of tourism exports, since it produces predictable flows outside peak leisure seasons and it pulls higher spending per visitor. The plan therefore designates a limited initial set of convention cities with explicit sequencing. Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo remain unavoidable due to existing hotel stock and corporate presence, while Brasília is positioned as a controlled environment for institutional conferences, technical congresses, and international delegations, using the city’s administrative gravity as an advantage rather than forcing it to compete with coastal leisure. Recife and Salvador are treated as the Northeast’s convention anchors, not simply as beach destinations, with investment directed toward mid-scale venues that match realistic hotel capacity and transport schedules. The program does not attempt to create convention infrastructure everywhere at once; it concentrates on a few nodes that can deliver a reliable experience, then expands after service metrics show stability.

The third pillar is standards, training, and safety, since service exports fail at the margin of trust. A national hospitality and tourism training track is introduced through technical institutes and employer-linked programs, focusing on language instruction, food handling, basic accounting, maintenance skills, and customer service routines that reduce the dependence on a small elite labor pool. Food safety and sanitation standards are unified for hotels and restaurants participating in the program, with inspection designed to be predictable and non-extortionary, rotating teams and standardized checklists replacing discretionary enforcement that historically invites bribery. Public security is handled through a limited, practical measure: designated tourism safety units within existing policing structures in the main hubs, focused on rapid response and deterrence in high-traffic areas, coupled with clear reporting channels that prevent small incidents from becoming international narratives.

The fourth pillar is currency and pricing discipline. Tourism inflows can strengthen reserves, yet they also create incentives for parallel exchange and price gouging if the system is poorly designed. A formal traveler exchange window is established with transparent spreads, available at airports, major hotels, and bank branches in program cities, with strict penalties for fraud and a reporting line that allows the Treasury and central banking authorities to see inflows as data rather than rumor. Pricing transparency is enforced through participation conditions, including published room rates in foreign languages and basic consumer protection rules for registered operators. The objective is to capture foreign receipts inside the formal system without turning tourism into a black-market subsidy.

External promotion is executed as targeted economic outreach rather than ideology. Itamaraty, in coordination with the Board, prioritizes practical messaging in North America and Western Europe around stability, infrastructure improvements, and service reliability, while also placing Brazil’s cultural and architectural modernization in a disciplined frame that supports conventions and professional travel. The program uses consulates, cultural institutes, radio and press placements, and partnerships with shipping and airlines to sell circuits rather than isolated destinations, since visitors who move through multiple nodes generate broader regional income and justify continued investment in transport regularity.

Geographic distribution is built into the plan’s routing logic. The Northeast is positioned for both leisure and convention capture, supported by hotel finance tied to sanitation and transport readiness, and by agro-industrial and packaging supply lines that reduce operating costs. The Center-West is treated as a convention and administrative travel node centered on Brasília, supported by scheduled connectivity and reliable urban services rather than resort fantasies. The South is developed as a cultural and seasonal circuit, with an emphasis on service standards and transport integration that makes it accessible without extreme cost. The North is handled cautiously, prioritizing river and frontier logistics that can be sustained, with modest, extraction-linked service development rather than overbuilt prestige projects. Where northern routes become viable, the port of Santa Rosa and the improved coastal logistics are treated as practical enablers for supply and maintenance, keeping operating costs from becoming a permanent penalty.

The plan acknowledges its own risks. Construction materials can be diverted into hotels at the expense of core infrastructure, and the program therefore imposes a materials allocation discipline that favors standardized designs and phased starts, with approvals tied to regional cement and steel availability. Corruption and patronage can attach themselves to hotel licensing and municipal works, and the response is to make support conditional and verifiable, using template contracts, published eligibility rules, and rotating inspections. Tourism can also trigger political backlash if it is perceived as an elite indulgence, and internal messaging therefore frames the program as employment absorption, service export earnings, and regional development, with visible linkages to sanitation, housing, training, and urban order.

You don't need fancy ads. You just need better angles. 

The Client: A small independent roaster. The Problem: They were posting generic ""latte art"" photos every day. They had 400 followers and zero engagement. 

The Strategy Switch: 

1. From ""Product"" to ""POV"" We stopped posting photos of coffee cups. Instead, we started posting POV Reels from the barista’s perspective. 

Example: ""POV: You ordered a cappuccino at 7am on a Tuesday."" (Sound of grinding beans, pouring milk). ASMR-style content. 

2. Engaging the Competition We identified the top 5 coffee shops in the city. We didn't poach their customers; we engaged with them. We replied to comments on their posts with helpful, non-promotional answers. This put our brand name in front of local coffee lovers. 

3. The ""Secret Menu"" Hook We created an Instagram-exclusive ""Secret Menu"" item. You could only order it if you showed that you followed the page. This drove actual foot traffic and followers simultaneously. 

The Result: 

Followers: 400 -> 12,000+ 

Foot traffic from IG: Up \~30% 

The Takeaway: Stop trying to ""sell"" your product on IG. Sell the vibe of using your product.

I noticed that I’m not able to get as fine a grind as I would like on my DC Max. It’s a relatively expensive grinder to be underperforming, so I’m wondering if I need burr replacement. For context, I’ve had the grinder for about 3 years, and I doubt that I’ve ground over 1 0lbs total - so definitely under your typical burr exchange time.

It’s on the absolute maximum fine setting and I use mainly medium roast beans. Anything below 20g, the coffee flows too fast (under 20 seconds). I definitely wish I could grind a bit finer to get a 1:2 ratio in 25-30 seconds.

Should I just exchange the burrs or is there anything else I should be checking for? Perhaps the grinder is just fine and I should just keep using it that way (with 20g at this level of fine grind).

1qzaezh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qzaezh/the_smell/,The Smell,"Alice shook me until I woke up. She was convinced that she had heard screaming. I listened for a few minutes but didn’t hear anything. I was drifting off again when she poked at me again.

“There it was—did you hear it?”

I didn’t hear anything other than the dog snoring on the floor.

“No, I don’t hear it.”

She threw the covers back and started up.

“I’m going to see what it is.”

I lay there half-aware of what was happening.

“No, no, I’ll go look.”

The night air hit me as I opened the front door. Its chill sent shivers down my legs. Stepping out onto the porch, I strained my ears.

Standing there in my underwear, the only thing I heard was crickets.

When I was convinced that nothing was screaming, I went back inside.

“There wasn’t any screaming.”

“I know there was,” she said adamantly.

“Well, there wasn’t any when I was outside, so I don’t know what else to say.”

The next day I made a point to ask my neighbor Eric if he had heard anything. Alice was certain that the screaming was coming from the direction of Eric’s house.

Eric had moved in the previous month, another story of divorce. He came by a couple of times to borrow this or that, but for the most part he kept to himself.

I knocked on his door. I was taken aback by the way he looked. Tired was an understatement.

“Hey, you okay?”

“Yeah, just a little cold. I’ll feel better tomorrow. What can I do for you?”

“Well, Alice thought she heard screaming last night. She won’t let it go. Did you hear anything?”

“She probably heard me throwing up. I was up half the night with it.”

He blew his nose. The toilet paper came away red.

“Oh shit, I better go.”

“Yeah, feel better, man.”

I came home after work that afternoon. Alice was sitting in the kitchen reading the paper.

“Hey honey, how was work?”

“It was—Jared was on my ass all day.”

“Oh, that’s not good. Why?”

“The rebranding that I’ve been stressing about, remember?”

Her face pinched in concentration. “Oh yeah. I’m sorry. Just tired, I guess.”

“You couldn’t go back to sleep last night?”

“Not really.”

I was watching her as she continued to browse the sports section. Don’t get me wrong—Alice was a big football fan, but she had never been one for box scores.

“You should’ve taken a nap today.”

“I was going to, but Eric stopped by to apologize. He said he was sick last night and he must’ve been the noise we heard.”

“He didn’t look too good when I saw him this morning.”

“Oh yeah, he looked dreadful, but I invited him in for some lunch and he seemed better when he left.”

Dinner was light that night. I wasn’t in the mood for anything heavy, and Alice said that she was still full from lunch.

Randy, our chocolate lab, usually begged for food no matter what we had, but he didn’t come into the dining room. I held out part of my sandwich and still he only sniffed, then gave me a pitiful look.

“Has Randy been weird all day?” I asked Alice.

“No, he’s been fine. Why?”

“He’s just not in here begging. I wonder if he’s sick.”

“Maybe he needs to go out. I’ll put him out back.”

Alice walked toward Randy. He whimpered, backing away.

“Come on, Randy. Let’s go outside.”

He continued to back away.

Alice grabbed him by the collar and started to lead him, but he snapped out at her hand.

I yelled at him as I jumped up off my chair. He ran back to his bed. I grabbed some paper towels, expecting a mess of blood. There wasn’t—he had got her pretty good, but she was hardly bleeding.

“He didn’t get me that bad,” she laughed.

I gave her the paper towels and put Randy in the backyard. I pulled the first aid kit from the guest bathroom and wrapped Alice’s hand. It had already stopped bleeding, but I figured it was better to be safe.

That night Randy slept in the guest bedroom, because his behavior was still strange toward Alice—the person that had been his number one for six years.

I felt the bed shift. I looked over; it was 3:15 in the morning. Alice wasn’t in bed. I was getting up to go look for her, but I dozed and fell back off.

I heard our faucet turn on. I looked at the clock again—it was 4:30.

“What’re you doing?” I asked, three-quarters still asleep.

“Just had to use the bathroom.”

She kissed me.

I recoiled slightly. Her breath was rank and coppery.

“What’s wrong?” Her face was empty.

“Something smells bad.”

“Randy used the bathroom in the house. That’s probably what you’re smelling.”

I nodded and dropped back off.

Alice was already in the kitchen when I walked in. She was dressed for December in April.

I made some coffee and offered her some; she waved her hand in refusal. Randy was usually laid out by her side in the mornings, but he was missing.

“Where’s Randy?”

“I put him outside,” she said flatly.

“Are you okay?”

She turned and smiled.

“Yeah, I’m fine.”

“You sure?”

“Yeah, I’m fine. Really.”

“Is Randy okay?”

She turned back, staring at the window.

“Yeah, I think he’s going to be just fine now.”

I grabbed my stuff and headed for work. Outside, I did a double take. Eric’s car had gone.

Alice said Randy had escaped while I was at work. She had tried to walk him, but he slipped his leash. Though in the six years we had him, he had only ever been walked a handful of times. We had fenced in our backyard so that he could run around out there.

I spent that evening knocking on doors and canvassing the neighbors. None of them had seen Randy. I put up posters, but after a week he still hadn’t shown up, or even a clue shared about where he was.

Alice also started wearing more perfume as the days passed. The floral notes blended with a sick, sweet odor. Her nails had also become black and earthen.

As the days fed into May, the heat picked up outside. This also brought a new level of stress. Eric’s car hadn’t returned. Alice and I had begun sleeping in separate bedrooms. I begged her to let me understand what was happening with her. She would always smile and say nothing was wrong, and by the last week of April I couldn’t stand the smell of her. There was also a new smell that kept sweeping through the house whenever the air conditioning came on.

It smelled of hamburger left in the sun. I couldn’t take it anymore. I made plans to go camping with a couple of my friends that weekend.

I needed my tent from the attic. When I pulled the rope, the smell fell on me with putrid weight. I climbed the ladder, choking with each step. As I reached the top, I heard a squelch coming from the corner. A dry heave wracked my body. The sound stopped. There was a shuffle.",14,1770561189.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

Could anybody offer some pointers? Could there be some good money to be made from being a middle man on this, or is it more hassle than it would be worth? What would she need to be prepared to do?

But of course I always end up sleeping on the couch because Nick At Night made me tired

So, one night I wake up to the prickly feeling. Like an instinct. Just bolted into a sitting position and stared out the front window. We lived in rural Georgia, so you can imagine the magnitude of trees. In perfect light cast from the moon, I see a silhouette of someone in a tree. The family dog dashes to the window and is snarling into the glass. 

Terrified, I run into my parents room and try to explain to my parents that there is a strange person outside. Dad grabs something defensive and darts outside with the dogs to beat the wax off the hot head. I tremble in Mama's arms until Dad comes home and says he saw no one and to go to bed. 

I decide to sleep in my regular bedroom. I fill in my sister in as to what happened. Dad is making regular rounds in the house with a cup of coffee. We're all still fine and I finally think ""I can sleep."" 

Nope. I notice the man outside my window. From what I can see in the moonlight, he gives me a shush signal and runs away. Just turns around to run a straight line away.

Yesterday, I attended a lecture at **NYU Tandon**. I figured it was the perfect chance to see how the Cuneflow AI Notebook handles a classroom/lecture scenario instead of just a traditional meeting.

**Full disclosure:** I’m still running an older firmware version (manual updates are a bit of a struggle, haha!), but I brought it along anyway.

**The Experience:**  
I was sitting in the second row. It was one of those quiet, focused lectures where nobody had a laptop out. **Opening a glowing screen would have felt pretty impolite.** I just laid the Cuneflow flat on the desk like a regular notebook.

**The Result:**  
It was beyond my expectations. Because the room was silent (except for the professor), the recording was crystal clear. The transcription was incredibly fast, and watching the AI summary generate in real-time while I was listening was a total game-changer for my note-taking.

Even without the latest update, it handled the academic environment perfectly. It’s making me realize this is just as much a tool for students as it is for professionals.
