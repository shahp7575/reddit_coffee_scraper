The brewery was closed for the night, lights dimmed, the aroma of brewing hops still floating through the halls. Inside CJ’s apartment — tucked behind the brewery’s back corridor — the Champion and his team sat around two laptops and a large monitor.

CJ leaned over Caleigh’s shoulder.
Matt paced behind them like a restless Houndoom.
Charmeleon sat on the couch, tail flame glowing.
Pichu sparked every few seconds.

Caleigh clicked into another document.

Caleigh:
“Look at this—Cyclones changed ownership the same year Team Rocket took over Coney Island.”

CJ’s eyes narrowed.

CJ:
“Before that, nothing was abandoned. The rides were open. The boardwalk was alive. The breweries, bars, arcades—everything was running.”

Matt stopped pacing.

Matt:
“And right after the NEW Cyclones owners took control…
they shut everything down.
Convenient timing, huh?”

CJ felt the pieces clicking together.

CJ:
“So Maria Jones takes over… Rocket arrives… the island collapses.”

Caleigh nodded slowly.

Caleigh:
“She didn’t just buy land—she bought silence, tourism, ownership rights, zoning contracts… all right before Rocket started pushing people out.”

Matt clenched his fists.

Matt:
“When I was with Rocket, I saw her.
Maria Jones was in Giovanni’s private meetings.
She wasn’t wearing Rocket gear…
but she WAS giving orders.”

CJ stepped back from the screen.

CJ:
“Then she’s not just a businesswoman—she might be funding the whole operation.”

Caleigh pulled up another file.

Caleigh:
“And whatever proof Rocket has?
We need it.”

Matt nodded.

Matt:
“They store their financials and donor files in a secure vault at the Manhattan base.
If we get those files, everything becomes exposed.”

CJ checked the wall clock.

CJ:
“6 PM.”

He tightened his gloves.

CJ:
“Rest until 9.
Gear up at 9:30.
Infiltration starts at 10.”

Matt cracked a grin.

Matt:
“I never thought I’d break into Rocket wearing their uniform… for the good guys.”

⸻

🕛 Scene 2 — Gear On, Ready to Move

By 9:30 PM, CJ’s apartment looked like a field base.
	•	Tactical belts on
	•	Rocket grunt uniforms fully zipped
	•	Fake IDs clipped
	•	Hats tilted low
	•	Supplies packed
	•	Charmeleon’s flame dimmed for stealth
	•	Pichu riding in a sling pack
	•	Mew hovering silently, ready to teleport

Caleigh secured her gloves.

Caleigh:
“Feels weird wearing this.”

CJ looked in the mirror — Rocket hat, black vest, fake badge.

CJ:
“Yeah. But it gets us in.”

Matt adjusted his own uniform, the only one who looked completely natural in Rocket gear.

Matt:
“Alright. Mew, Starbucks — one block from the Manhattan base.”

Mew chirped softly, glowing sky-blue.

CJ took Caleigh’s hand.

Matt touched Mew’s paw.

And—

FLASH.

⸻

☕ Scene 3 — Behind a Manhattan Starbucks

They appeared behind a dumpster, the stench of stale coffee and bakery trash hitting them immediately.

Caleigh gagged.

Caleigh:
“Oh my—this is worse than a Gulpin’s breath.”

Matt smirked.

Matt:
“Welcome to Midtown.”

CJ peeked around the corner.

Across the street:
A steel, windowless fortress with armed guards pacing outside.

CJ:
“That’s the base?”

Matt:
“Level 4 Manhattan Operations.
Home of Rocket’s financial servers.”

They were about to move toward the alley when—

A sharp voice cut the air.

???:
“You’ve GOT to be kidding me.”

They turned.

Leaning against the wall, arms crossed, wearing an annoyed smirk—

Trish.

Matt:
“…Of course.”

Trish walked forward, heels clacking against the concrete.

Trish:
“You idiots actually came back here.
In Rocket uniforms.”
(she snorted)
“Matt, you grow a conscience and suddenly think you’re unstoppable?”

Matt stepped forward.

Matt:
“Move, Trish.”

She grinned.

Trish:
“You know the rules.
If you want through MY territory—
you battle me.”

CJ rubbed his forehead.

CJ:
“Seriously?”

Caleigh whispered:

Caleigh:
“She’s REALLY doing this?”

Matt cracked his neck.

Matt:
“Fine.
Two on two.”

⸻

⚔️ Scene 4 — Matt vs. Trish: Midnight Alley Battle

Trish threw her Poké Balls high.

Trish:
“Houndoom!
Roserade!
Light up the alley!”

Black flames burst.
Petals sliced through the air.

Matt tossed his Poké Balls lazily.

Matt:
“Slaking.
Swampert.
Handle it.”

🔥 Houndoom vs Swampert

Houndoom shot a roaring Flamethrower.

Swampert sprinted THROUGH the flames—
grabbed Houndoom by the jaw—
and slammed him into the concrete.

KO.

🌿 Roserade vs Slaking

Roserade danced forward, firing Razor Leafs.

Slaking didn’t flinch.

Then—

BOOM!
One Hammer Arm sent Roserade flying into a pile of cardboard boxes.

KO.

Trish stared, jaw dropped.

Trish:
“…I hate you.”

Matt grinned.

Matt:
“You always did.”

Trish crossed her arms and sighed.

Trish:
“I never saw you.
You were never here.
I’m going home.”

And she vanished into the shadows.

Caleigh blinked.

Caleigh:
“…Did she just… help us?”

Matt:
“No.
That’s her way of pretending she’s not helping.”

CJ adjusted his Rocket hat.

CJ:
“Alright.
Let’s get inside.”

⸻

🏢 Scene 5 — Entering the Rocket Base

They crossed the street calmly, blending in with a group of real Rocket grunts heading in for a shift.

Matt swiped his old keycard.

BEEP — ACCESS GRANTED.

Door one opened.

A second door scanned their badges.

BEEP — ACCESS GRANTED.

Door two opened.

Now they were inside:

Long metallic hallways.
Ceiling cameras rotating.
Rocket banners hanging like flags of a dictatorship.

Matt whispered:

Matt:
“Stay close.
This place is a maze.
Vault’s down three levels and behind two security checkpoints.”

Caleigh tightened her bag strap.

Caleigh:
“Then let’s move before someone checks the cameras.”

CJ nodded.

CJ:
“Let’s find the data that takes Maria Jones down.”

They stepped deeper into the base.

Lights flickered.
Footsteps echoed.
The doors sealed shut behind them.

And the real mission began.

1pc716j,https://www.reddit.com/r/EckhartTolleTV/comments/1pc716j/eckhart_tolle_answers_question_about_depression/,Eckhart Tolle answers question about depression and antidepressants (Prozac),"And this way, the pain body becomes fuel for consciousness. This is why many of the wisest, most enlightened men and women on our planet once had a heavy pain body, you say. So what I wanted to ask is that so many people today medicate themselves.

Any uncomfortable feelings that you have, you go to a psychiatrist or counselor, remember, the first thing they do is prescribe medication (antidepressant) for you. Does medication (antidepressant, tranquilizers, etc ) get in the way of using the pain body as fuel for enlightenment? [Speaker 1 : Eckhart Tolle ] (7:35:53 - 7:37:08)

To a large extent, it does. There may be certain extreme cases when medication , antidepressants, tranquilizers, etc -- is necessary. And for people who already are on antidepressants medication, it's certainly not advisable to go off medication without the advice of a doctor.

So if you feel that it's time for you to get off, talk to a doctor who is relatively conscious and can help you gradually to get off the medication. So it's really a question of not giving in to this culturally conditioned behavior that says whenever you feel some discomfort inside yourself, emotional disturbance, immediately to seek some external help in the form of a substance that you ask your doctor to give you. Rather, learn to be with inner discomfort that arises, learn to be with emotional pain that arises rather than wanting to eliminate it.

Learn to accept it. Acceptance is one of the main focal points of this teaching. Learn to accept whatever emotion arises in you rather than run away from it or wanting to eliminate it.

[Speaker 2] (7:37:08 - 7:37:26)

But why? This is the thing, Eckhart. Why would I want to accept it?

That's why people are medicating themselves. That's why people eat, they gamble, they overwork themselves, they live in denial, they become unconscious because they don't want to deal with the pain. That's what we're all trying to get away from, is the pain.

[Speaker 1 : Eckhart Tolle ] (7:37:26 - 7:38:40)

Yes, yes. Now, if you medicate it with antidepressant, it doesn't actually go away. It dulls the pain so that you're not conscious of it anymore.

It's still there in the background. It's the same thing for many illnesses. For example, I had a heavy cold a couple of weeks ago.

Yes. I didn't take anything, but some people take things so that the symptoms are suppressed of the cold. It doesn't suppress the cold.

The cold is still there. So why accept it? It's because it is here at this moment.

So it's part of bringing this inner yes to whatever arises in the present moment. It is part of becoming friendly with the present moment, even if on the surface, the present moment doesn't look that great. So we are bringing, and this is where the awareness begins to come into the emotion.

If we bring acceptance to whatever we feel at this moment, rather than not wanting to feel it, the equivalent of that would be an external situation that arises, and then I resist it because I don't want this situation to be as it is, but it already is.

Questioner to Eckhart Tolle:

I take half of the smallest dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) , an antidepressant medication. I have done without because I have a belief it will keep me from awakening. However, I have greater clarity and seem to hold presence more consistently when I continue with this small amount.

Eckhart Tolle answers:

A related question asks, do you think the huge increased consumption of antidepressants in recent years points to the ego's effort to suppress emerging consciousness? Of course, antidepressants drugs are there because the emotional pain gets too much, the pain of living, somehow an escape from the pain, dull the pain in some way. And eventually you have to face the pain and then realize that it's not as big as it seemed.

You've been running away from a monster. And if you really look at the monster, it's not such a big monster anymore. Facing it through presence, allowing that pain, whatever you want to call it, existential pain, the fear associated with it, the heaviness, allowing it to be there.

It may come in waves and then you watch the arising and subsiding of a wave of pain in whatever form. Antidepressants make it harder to be present. If you're on this very small dose, a time will come when you won't need that anymore and it may be very soon.

Some, it is often the pain body that manifests, as I described, the energy field of pain body, some energy field, some pain bodies have the energy field of heaviness, great heaviness to them. And they arise periodically. I had that.

My (Eckhart Tolle) pain body was predominantly heavy, a weight I couldn't live with, a dull pain, continuous in the background. I (Eckhart Tolle) might still be on antidepressants if I had taken antidepressants at the time. Somehow I must have allowed the pain to be there without knowing anything about allowing.

With presence growing and accelerating in you, face the pain that arises with that intense presence. And acceptance. And any state that arises, accept and watch it so that it doesn't turn into a self, an unhappy self.

If you accept and watch, any state arises is just that state now. That field, that energy field, that particular manifestation, that particular content arises. No self in it anymore.

The perpetuation of inner states is through them becoming a self, a me. Then they go on and on. You feed them.

You feed them. And you take time away, just what is now. So that whatever the emotional state is, the feeling state doesn't use your mind because if it uses your mind, you're back in time and you will be in past and future, which are both heavy.

And immediately the me arises out of that. So for that, you need the intensity of presence. Take a picture of an Isagadatta and look at that to get the quality of intensity.

Or the picture of a Zen, a painting of a Zen master, but better a photo of a master. And then see the uncompromising quality of presence. But it allows.

Uncompromising doesn't mean it doesn't allow. Uncompromisingly, it allows. It's uncompromising and allowing.

And anything that's faced will undergo change. We know that from dreams. We've all had dreams, running away from some monster or you're being pursued by some presence, some monster.

And when you finally face it in a dream, it's not that horrible. And often this is the myth. It becomes transformed actually into a benign figure, an ancient myth.

The famous, the dragon turns into something else or the frog turns into something, a prince. But you have to kiss the frog. Look.

Of course, you have to reduce very slowly if you are on entity presence, then careful and very alert and very carefully do it. Check within yourself, see if there's any waiting for the next question or this or that. Or whether there's such intensity of aliveness throughout your entire being that this moment is good enough as it is and more than good enough.

Is there a flight into thought as you sit there, which means into time, which means away from this, away from now, away from the aliveness, the intensity of this moment and the peace of this moment. What is the role of vision in creating a new world? Does vision arise out of presence?

Vision meaning you see something before it has manifested externally. The good thing is that you don't have to create a new world. It creates itself through presence. So you don't have to do it. There is no, in that sense, it's truer to say there is no free will. You are no more than an opening and the totality, the one consciousness expresses itself through you.

Is that the relief? You don't have to create a new world, but it'll create itself perhaps through you. And through presence, you may suddenly see what's needed.

Insight and realization comes, it's not egoic. There's no struggling and no effort in it. You will always know when there's effort, then there's no alignment with presence.

There's some ego involvement there. I need to get somewhere. I need to create a better world.

And so there'll be struggle. Effort means needing to get to the future. That's effort.

It doesn't mean that there may not be intense energy behind what you do, but it's not the energy of effort. Effort means you're being pulled towards future. But when something, when action arises out of presence, there may be great intensity and passion, you could say, but not the passion that needs you to reach the future.

The doing itself, it's the doing that arises is sufficient unto itself and there's joy, aliveness, and passion in the doing. It doesn't need the goal. Of course, in time, there's time in the phenomenal world, the doing will result in certain forms arising, new forms arise externally.

You don't need any of those for your salvation. You're not looking to the future for salvation. That means there's no effort anymore, but perhaps great intensity and great passion and great aliveness.

That's how the new world creates itself. So you may pursue a goal, but the arriving is not all that important. Not a goal that is going to free you, not a goal that is going to enhance your sense of self or your sense of importance.

Not in that sense. A good sign is when anything that arises out of presence, it means this moment is not a means to an end. The doing is fulfilled and fulfilling in itself, every moment.

You're no longer reducing the now to a means to an end, which is the old consciousness. And then very often you create, because you have a vision of heaven, and in pursuing your vision of heaven, you're creating hell. That's often happened.

There have been many visions of heaven and utopia. And in pursuing that, we need to get there, there. This is the ideal image.

Once we get there, we'll be fine. We'll be free. We will be whatever we will be. In the meantime, we need to adopt certain means towards getting there. Okay. We need to eliminate all those who don't believe in this goal to start with.

The madness continues. And this works on the smallest levels to observe any kind of doing in your life, movement from here to there, walking from here to there. Is it a means to an end, or is there a sense of completeness in the doing?

And you will notice the qualitative difference is tremendous between any action that's a means to a future end and an action that is not a means, but there's a sense of completeness to it. And yet there may be great energy there. We talked about eating.

Why many people lose consciousness when they eat is it's a means to an end. I need to get this food in through the body. There's no quality, no presence.

Even making a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, is that a means to an end? The tiniest things using them to see if you can be present with what is. It's never, the illusion in the old consciousness is the next moment is more important than this one.

Always, always the next moment is more important than this one. It does not mean that you have to slow down a lot, presence arising. We talked about that film I saw where those beings, everything they do is very slow.

And sometimes when presence arises, at first people try to do everything very carefully. And then there's a little bit of self-consciousness still there. Okay, I'm trying to be present.

And then you see, that's not quite it either. They're simple, reaching for glass. The glass is traveling to your mouth.

It looks like just a normal, just a normal action. And yet it's not a means to an end. And then a sense of presence pervades the entire energy field around you.

So any action that becomes a vehicle for presence, it's a vehicle for presence. And I think that's the beauty of the tea ceremony. As you know, they developed the tea ceremony in Japan originally so that basically means every movement is sufficient unto itself.

You're not moving towards the end result. You're just with what is. And that is the beauty.

It is possible that later it becomes a ritual and no longer works, there's certain deadness after a while that comes into a ritual and they may be performing the ritual, every movement is correct, but the presence is no longer there, that is possible too. But you will know that anybody with the slightest presence can tell the difference between somebody performing something like the tea ceremony or Tai Chi that requires intense presence. And you will know, I haven't learned Tai Chi, but I can watch Tai Chi and I know whether they're simply going through the movements and it may look fine on the surface, but the field of presence isn't there.

And somebody else going through the same movements and they see it emanates presence. And so that's the beauty of Tai Chi is that no movement is a means, you're not, when the arm moves from here, they're probably masters of Tai Chi here, so what am I talking about? But all I know is presence.

The hand moves from here to here and usually in your mind, you're already there. So the intervening movement or time period is a means to an end because the movement will have completed itself when it reaches there. So you're already mentally there and the hand is lagging behind.

So there's no presence, there's the projection of future that you're trying to get to. And then there's the possibility of moving in a way that at any stage of the movement, there's no movement into the future, there's continuous, you're not trying to get anywhere, just, and there's, that's the quality of presence flowing into it. And you could perform the same movement outwardly correctly, but you would have a mental projection there and the master would be able to tell or anybody, even if they know nothing about Tai Chi, would be able to tell that it doesn't, the emanation of presence isn't there.

But I, my feeling is that, I don't know anything about it, but my feeling is that presence, Tai Chi originated as spontaneous movement, presence expressing itself through a human being, in spontaneous, very slow kind of dance. And no movement was planned before. Nothing is, there's no, it moves with total nowness.

And simply one way in which presence can express itself, it can flow into. And so there was this, perhaps it was an old woman or an old man, or who knows, a young woman or a young man, suddenly moving and the few people around them saw, this is beautiful. What's he doing?

What's she doing? It was totally spontaneous. And then they said, this is so beautiful, we need to learn this.

And then gradually they started to see, okay, now he's lifting his right leg and then he holds it up for five seconds and then it goes down. So you can, you learn it by watching the spontaneity. Of course, now it becomes something learned, but even that can take you into presence.

It's not how it arose originally, my feeling is. And they, so they observed and then it became a technique, so to speak. But even the technique can work.

Although originally it came the other way around. Presence came and then it resulted in the movement. Now you perform the movement and the movement results in presence, if it works as it's meant to.

So we don't need to create a new world, that's good. Don't need to worry about that. Maybe I'll have one more question.

Thank you for choosing to share, choosing it in quotation marks. Thank you, it's good. Thank you for choosing to share your realization.

[Speaker 6] (8:54:30 - 8:55:17)

My question is around the issue of psychiatric medications and awakening. We have talked about this issue on ETT Forum. It is an issue in my life situation and the life situation of many others on the Forum.

Some believe they need to go after medications to awaken, and others say without the medication, they would not have enough clarity to even begin to bring presence in their lives. My question is, can a person take psychiatric medication and still awaken? Will psychiatric medication hold a person back or slow down the awakening process?

[Speaker 1] (8:55:19 - 8:55:39)

Thank you. Thank you. May I ask a personal question?

Are you on medication?

[Speaker 2] (8:55:40 - 8:55:40)

Yes.

[Speaker 1] (8:55:41 - 9:07:16)

But you're also here. That is already part of the answer. Because for you to be here, there must be some inner recognition of awareness.

And so despite whatever the medication is, or whatever their condition, your condition is, there is an arising of awareness. So it's easier for me to answer this question because you are standing there than an abstract question. You are living proof.

I'm not saying necessarily you don't experience periods when you are taken over by whatever patterns there are in the mind. But there is an opening into awareness, which is not the case with many people who are not on medication or who are considered normal. They are not standing here.

Many of them are not and wouldn't be. In them, there is no opening. So one cannot say categorically under this or that condition, awareness cannot arise, awakening cannot happen.

As a general rule, before anybody seeks help of that kind, I would advise to explore other possibilities. If you wish to gradually become free of medication, which in many cases can obscure the awareness that wants to arise, you would need to do it with a physician who is relatively conscious. There are some.

There are maybe twofold questions. One question is, with medication, is awareness able to come through? And of course, that depends what kind of medication, or over what period of time, and other factors.

But in some cases, I believe it is. In other cases, it's not. It can obscure the awareness.

The other question is, a certain mental, what is diagnosed as mental illness, can awareness arise there? And again, that depends on the nature of the illness. Sometimes in the West, shifts in consciousness are misinterpreted.

If they happen suddenly, they can be misinterpreted and misdiagnosed by a physician. And Western physicians, because they're conditioned by the Western system, have no idea of shifts in consciousness. It's not part of the medical model.

There are no shifts in consciousness in psychiatry. You can either, you are normal, but normal, of course, is insane, but they don't know that. Or you are illness, you're diseased, the mind is ill.

There are people who are put on medication, unfortunately, children sometimes, in increasing numbers, in whom there may simply be a change in consciousness happening. There are children who, for the most absurd reasons, are put on medication just to keep them quiet. And people like who in India, Ramana Maharshi, the Indian sage, who when he was 17, 16 or 17, suddenly did something that in the West would have been regarded as a sign of severe mental illness.

He left his home, he went to, took a train, and he sat down by a temple and stopped doing anything, didn't even put food in his mouth, just sat. And of course, in the West, they would have put him away. And in India, they respected it and allowed him to sit there and fed him, people came.

And after a few years, he started to speak again. And it turned out that he was awakened, he had awakened. But the shift was so sudden that he became dysfunctional for a while, from a normal viewpoint, became dysfunctional, couldn't operate anymore in the world.

So this can happen to people sometimes, and it's totally misinterpreted. So often, what is called medical psychiatric illness, not always can be a misdiagnosed shift in consciousness. At other times, there is actually a condition there with which it would be very difficult to live.

Many types of so-called schizophrenia, again, schizophrenia is a huge term which can be applied if you don't know what exactly is wrong, you call it schizophrenia, it's almost like that. The same way in the physical body, it's a viral infection, they don't really know, but this is a term that covers a lot of things, it's a viral infection. Oh, now I know what it is.

And then schizophrenia, now I know what it is. In many cases, it is true that in mental illness, the very cause of the illness can be total identification with certain mental movements, lack of awareness. I've had limited success when I worked with people one- on-one some years ago.

I had some people who had forms of schizophrenia who came to see me who were on medication, and by sitting with them and pointing to the possibility of awareness, they were able to become free and eventually also become free of the medication. For example, I remember one case, a woman came to see me who had severe auditory hallucinations, so-called voices. And again, we don't even know whether the entities actually are talking to her, it's possible, but it really comes to the same thing, whether it's thoughts in her head that take the form of a voice that she hears, the voice tells her to do something, it's very insistent, or several voices sometimes, very insistent, telling her to do this, do that, and enormous energy behind that voice.

And the way I approached it was to point out the possibility of not giving, not paying attention to the content of what the voice says, but simply to be aware that there is a voice speaking and that it is a voice in the head, it is a thought, I called it a thought, maybe it's something else, but it comes to the same thing. It's a thought, it's a voice, whatever it says, you say there's a voice, be the awareness for the voice, don't fight it, be the awareness so that the voice, you don't do what the voice says because you disregard the content. So if the voice says, you are God, say thank you, there's a voice again.

If the voice says you are the devil, thank you, there's the voice again. You are the awareness for the voice, disregard the content. Then gradually the voice lost its power because she disregarded the content of the voice, awareness grew.

So ultimately the healing in any case is awareness. So awareness can arise in the strangest circumstances and to people you would never have predicted could arise to, and that includes even people who have a so-called psychiatric disorder or who are on medication, it can happen. Nobody can categorically say that it cannot happen.

In some cases, those people are closer than normal people. As you know, there was a movement in psychiatry in the 60s and 70s where they, it was called anti-psychiatry, where it was recognized that often psychiatric conditions are really something else. So it's really, it is simple in your case that obviously despite the medication, you are here and something, a shift is happening inside you.

Nothing can stand against the power of awareness ultimately because the power of awareness is the power of the evolution of the universe itself. So nothing really that, it will, it seeks the slightest opening and it can come through that. So I would say that trust that as it's happening, it will continue to happen for you.

And there may be a point when with help, the medication won't be needed anymore as awareness grows, but you need somebody who is conscious to help you with that, a physician who is conscious to help you with that. It's wonderful to see that it is working.

1pc702r,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pc702r/rf_the_same_exact_place/,[RF] The same exact place,"Just another Tuesday under the red star.

Mother woke around noon.

She came into the kitchen without a word, face swollen on one side, the print of Father’s hand still purple across her cheek. She lit the stove, put water for coffee, and sat opposite me—the same chair where she had beaten me hours earlier.

I waited for the screaming to start again.
It never came.
Instead she stared at the cracked table and spoke so quietly I had to lean in.

“Your grandfather crossed a river once,” she said. 

“January. Forty-nine below. The guards shot the dogs first so the barking wouldn’t carry. He walked on the bodies of men who had fallen before him. Ice broke. Water took his boots, then his toes, one by one. When he reached the other side he had no feeling left below the knees, but he kept walking because the Russians were still behind.”

She stirred the coffee and let her gaze drift toward the Black Sea through the thin window.

“He came home in 1954. Skinny, grey, eyes like holes. The first night he slept in his own bed he woke screaming that the guards were dragging him back. My mother tried to calm him. He beat her unconscious with the same fists that had carried him across the ice. Said if she was soft the Russians would smell it on her and come for all of us.”

She looked at me then. Really looked.

“I was seven. He made me stand in the yard in February with no coat until I stopped crying. Said tears freeze and give your position away. When I came inside he beat me with the belt for shivering too loud. Every time I flinched he said, ‘Good. Remember this feeling. It will keep you alive.’”
The coffee boiled over. She didn’t move.
“That is what they taught him in the camp. Pain is a language. If you speak it first, nobody can use it on you.”

She tapped the spoon against the cup. Tap. Tap. Tap. Like bones.

“I thought I was teaching you to survive,” she whispered. “I thought if I made you hard enough, the world would leave you alone.”

Her voice cracked on the last word. Not tears—she had none left. Just the sound of something inside her finally breaking after forty years.

“I was wrong,” she said. “The world doesn’t leave you alone. It just waits until you’re the one holding the pipe.”

She stood, walked to the window, and stared out at the grey blocks, the laundry lines, and the red star still painted on the water tower even though nobody believed in it anymore.

“Go to your room,” she said without turning. “Your father will say what needs to be said when he comes home tonight.”

I went.

That was the only time she ever told me about her father.
The only time she ever came close to an apology.

Later, when the regime fell and people burned portraits in the streets, I understood: the guards never left Siberia. They just came home inside the people who survived them.

And some of us learned the language so well we started speaking it to our own children.

1pc6wq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/1pc6wq0/was_it_coercion/,Was it coercion?,"Hi there. I just joined this sub so im not sure if there are any similar stories out there, or if this is a common experience but I'd like to see what this community says about my experience. This will be a long post, but I want to give as much context to account for my position also because at the end of the day, I do feel coerced and as a result I haven't been with anyone for nearly a year. I feel dirty, but I do have a history of sexual assaults, and recently,  someone I trusted told me that a different incident (i will post about this seperately) wasn't revictimisation, but it was me being overly sensitive as a result of my past experiences. I kinda feel this is gaslighting and I'm really sad about it, but I have been questioning my sanity. 

About a year ago I met someone online, and I really didn't like them. In fact, I was a little repulsed by them. Before they even asked how I was, which is a norm where I live, they asked where I live. I spoke to a friend about how threatened I felt, and they said I was being unreasonable- maybe this person just didn't adhere to this custom and I should give them a chance. A few days went by and the conversation was ok. Nothing interesting,  but nothing that put me off either, so one day I asked what they were doing and they said they were in the same mall I happened to be, so I asked if they want to grab coffee. They said yes and we agreed on a time. I waited 10min past the time we agreed on and left when they didn't show up. I wasn't annoyed or anything because I wasn't that into the conversation,  but that put the idea of meeting them in my head. 

We eventually decided on a day to meet up toward the end of the year. At the meeting, I was taken aback when I went in for a friendly hug, which is also a common thing where I live but they kissed me on the mouth. I felt this was crossing a line but I said nothing. We then had a few drinks and kissed again. Then it was time to go home, and I planned on taking an uber, but they insisted on dropping me. I said no a total of about 4 times because they had been drinking, but eventually just gave in, because I didn't want to cause a scene over nothing. Also, I figured I would be safe because I live in a small gated community,  and if I got out at the main gate, they wouldn't know where exactly I lived. 

When we got to the gate, they insisted they go in with me. This time, I must've said no like 200 times, and I also said that they should really stop because I have difficulty saying no. They didn't stop and eventually I let them in. 

I pulled out a chair for them and put on the kettle for some tea, but they suggested we go to bed instead. I said I want to take things slowly, so they asked if they could use the bathroom, which is an en suite. So I said sure, and they did. Im not quite sure how they got me into bed but they did, and when we had both kissed and taken our clothes off, they asked if we could have sex and I said OK. By this time I was so broken down after saying no all night that I just said yes. That was the last time I had sex.

After this I felt vile. We'd previously made plans to go swimming together on New Years day but I canceled and spent the day behind locked doors, having given their phone number (its part of the security procedure) and picture to security at the main gate, asking them not to let this person in. I was terrified they would show up although I hadn't blocked their number at this stage yet. Security said I couldn't do this because they couldn't act based on the information i had shared without this persons consent. So I told them that I couldn't swim because I had the runs, but they said they would just come visit and we'd have something to eat together. Then I said no, and that I just wanted to be alone; I said that I needed space. 2 hours later they texted me asking how I felt and, exasperated,  I finally blocked them. I spend new years day, 2025 in terror behind locked doors, unable to eat due to anxiety, that this person would show up at my door and rape me in my own bed. 

On the one hand, I feel like they were extremely pushy and completely disrespectful of my boundaries,  but I also feel like it was my own fault and that I shouldn't have agreed to meet with them in the first place. ",1,1764677671.0,rapecounseling,1,1.0,False

I love traveling. I've been to Cebu, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and hopefully next year sa Japan with friends. Inaasikaso ko pa visa ko (send help lol)

I love listening to music and playing guitar. Recently yung jam ko with a friend of mine is You and Me by Lifehouse. Wala akong alam sa music theory. Puro tabs and sometimes kinakapa ko lang. Kaya ko yung a twist in my story ng secondhand serenade, synesthesia. More on western music ako, sobrang bihira opm. I LOVE songs that I can relate to. If it sounds melancholic, chances are magugustuhan ko yan.

 I love movies about life, love, relationships, romcom, or anything I find interesting. Her, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, 500 days of summer, 50 first dates, before trilogy, fight club, seven, tenet, inception, the raid, list goes on and on

I tried canyoneering, whale diving, and other outdoor stuff and surprisingly I enjoyed them. 

I am a nerd when it comes to technology. I work in IT so medyo given na ito.

I love taking pictures of places I've been. I love romanticizing road trips, city lights. I recently started running every weekend morning. I'm not that maligalig type of person but I guess it depends on the chemistry. 

I almost forgot the most important thing, I love iced coffee. 

I like listening to other people's stories especially if there's something to learn from it.

I’m coming to terms with some things, and there’s a distinct moment I want to revisit with people who aren’t biased as my friends. I’m trying to figure out if the distance I’ve placed between myself and my dad/step-mom was the right thing to do.

If anyone realizes they know me, please don’t @ me or send this to others. I’m just processing and working on things. This is my perspective.

— Some quick context: My mom died suddenly when I was a teenager and I was the first responder. After, moved in across the country with my dad and step mother. We had a rocky relationship. I  wasn’t the best person. I was a teen— I was angry, reclusive, traumatized, and had undiagnosed autism. But I think a lot of things could have been handled better. I think my parents should have handled it better. —

I was 19 or 20F, this is a few years ago. I think it was over a summer, maybe covid summer? I was home from out of state college, and wasn’t able to earn money over summer because my step-mom is immunocompromised so we were worried.

I went to the store. While there, I remembered the house was out of coffee, and my brother was out of a snack he likes. My family usually buys those things. I got them the brands they liked. I didn’t tell them ahead of time. Then I asked to be reimbursed, it was maybe $26, since it wasn’t for me and I thought I was being helpful. No service to ask them ahead and I only remembered while at the store.

It turned into a big fight about money. My parents are fine, legit middle class which is saying something these days yk? Like ideal middle class I guess. I think.

Anyway it turned into a huge fight. Like huge. It ended with my step-mother threatening to kick me out, we were both screaming, it escalated really quickly. I reacted poorly. I gave her the finger and told her to go F herself & she had no right to threaten that. She left the house in the car and I was half convinced she was gone (she wasn’t ofc they’re still married), and I think I went on a walk.

Later we talked. They claimed they did have a right to kick me out (but didn’t do that). I apologized carefully — for how I expressed my feelings. Never apologized for the feelings themselves.

And again, my mom died. That’s the only “parent’s house” I had left. I think that’s why I got so angry.

I’m 25 now. They’re still married. We’ve done work on our relationship. They’ve since told me they would have treated me better & parented me better if they knew I was autistic. They apologized for not doing that. But I don’t think that’s comforting the way they meant it to be, and I don’t think I can ever forgive that moment. I think I’ll remember it forever. I think it permanently shifted our relationship in a way we can patch over, but never really heal, not completely. Like a painting hung over a hole in the drywall. Because I know they’ll never apologize for specific times like these, if they even remember them at all. They’re good at forgetting these things, then wondering why I live far away & feel I can’t depend on them.

There’s a lot of moments that stand out. Words, phrases, moments, fights, feelings. But this was a big one.

I plan to keep a relationship with my parents regardless. I love them, they love me. But sometimes I wonder if me putting as much distance between us as I have, physically and metaphorically, was the right thing to do, or if I’m missing out on time I could be spending with them. I live far away now and I don’t know if I’ll ever be close again.

My name is Nabil, I’m from Morocco, and I work as a freelance digital marketer. I want to share a story from 2022 that still makes me smile and reminds me why seeking discomfort can be so powerful.

I had seen a post by a girl named Sofia in the Yes Theory Morocco Facebook group. She was looking for a place to stay for the weekend, and without hesitation, I reached out to her. To my surprise, she was down. I was going to visit my parents in another city, but I decided to trust the situation. I left my apartment keys with the concierge so she could handle everything while I was away.

At that point, I had never met her. When I returned to Casablanca, Sofia was still around. I finally met her in person and we went to a coffee shop together. Over coffee, we got to know each other, sharing stories, laughs, and dreams. It was effortless and real. A total stranger became someone I could connect with in a meaningful way all because I chose to embrace uncertainty and say yes.

Looking back, I still feel good about that experience. It reminded me that stepping into discomfort and trusting life can lead to moments that are unforgettable. The best experiences often come from the times that scare us a little, the times we didn’t plan, and the times we simply chose to say yes.",2,1764676398.0,YesTheory,0,1.0,False

If you’ve attended enough Indian weddings, you already know how predictable return gifts have become. A box of dry fruits. A metal bowl wrapped in shiny plastic. A tiny Ganesha idol. A scented candle that loses its fragrance before you even reach home.

And honestly, nobody wants to spend their wedding budget on gifts that end up forgotten in a drawer.

But recently, something interesting is happening across weddings in metros and cultural hubs like Pune, Baner, Pimple Saudagar, Wakad, Kothrud, and Hinjewadi. Couples want the gifts they give to reflect their personality. They want guests to remember the experience long after the music stops and the décor comes down.

This shift isn’t just about aesthetics. It is about thoughtfulness.

And if you are planning your wedding, looking for ideas that feel fresh, useful, creative, and memorable, this guide breaks down the most unique return gift trends that are actually making waves right now

# Why Return Gifts Matter More Than You Think

Here’s the thing most people don’t talk about.

Return gifts are often the last impression your guests take home from your wedding. It’s the final moment that says:

This day meant a lot to us. Thank you for being part of it.

Many couples underestimate this part of the celebration and end up choosing something generic at the last minute. But when planned with intention, a return gift has the power to:

* Create emotional connection
* Reflect your taste and story
* Add uniqueness to your event
* Make your wedding stand out from the hundreds of others happening around the city

Think of it like a signature: one final detail that ties everything together.

So if you’re ready to elevate your wedding experience, let’s explore creative ideas that will get your guests talking.

# 1. Local Artisanal Favors That Support Pune’s Makers

Many modern couples want to be mindful about what they give. One of the biggest emerging trends is locally crafted products.

Why this works:

* Supports small artisans
* Adds emotional value
* Feels exclusive
* Reflects your personality and local culture

Ideas you can consider:

* Handcrafted soaps from boutique sellers in Aundh
* Mini terracotta planters from artists in Pashan
* Organic honey from local farms around Mulshi
* Art prints or tiny sketch bookmarks from Pune illustrators

These gifts feel thoughtful because they have a story behind them. Guests love knowing the item was made by a local craftsperson rather than mass-produced.

# 2. Edible Gifts That Aren’t Boring

If you want to give something eatable, move past the usual dry fruits and chocolates.

Here are options that are trending right now:

* Artisanal granola mixes
* Single-origin coffee beans from roasters in Kalyani Nagar
* Mini jars of homemade pickles or chutneys
* Gourmet cheese from local dairy farms
* Signature spice blends

A couple from Pimple Saudagar recently gifted cold-brew coffee concentrates with a custom label that said: “Love brewed stronger.” Guests not only loved it, they reordered from the vendor later.

Edible gifts work because they’re useful, shareable, and offer a personal touch.

# 3. Personalized Keepsakes Guests Actually Keep

Personalization is powerful, but only when it’s done right. Monogramming everything is not always the answer. Subtle, functional personalization is the trend.

Ideas that work beautifully:

* Engraved wooden coasters
* Fabric pouches with minimal initial embroidery
* Scented sachets with your wedding date
* Mini journals with custom covers

The key is to avoid plastering your full names and wedding date in huge fonts. Keep it elegant.

# 4. Eco-Friendly Gifts: Stylish and Sustainable

Sustainable return gifts have become mainstream, especially among couples who want to reduce waste.

Practical options include:

* Reusable jute or cotton tote bags
* Seed paper stationery
* Grow-your-own herb kits
* Bamboo cutlery sets

Couples in areas like Bavdhan and Kothrud are actively choosing zero-waste wedding themes. Eco-friendly gifting beautifully complements such setups.

# 5. Experience-Based Gifts That Feel Unique

Sometimes, the best gift isn’t a physical object at all.

Experience-based return gifts are rising in popularity because they’re memorable and different.

Ideas include:

* A tiny card giving access to a free pottery workshop
* Vouchers from wellness studios in Baner
* Passes for gourmet tasting at local restaurants
* Tickets to small cultural events
* Aromatherapy mini-session coupons

These options stand out because guests can enjoy them long after the wedding day.

# 6. Return Gifts That Double as Décor

If you want something aesthetically pleasing, think décor pieces that suit all home styles.

Some trending choices include:

* Mini Himalayan salt lamps
* Neutral-tone candle holders
* Framed calligraphy quotes
* Hand-painted terracotta diya sets
* Minimal wall hangings

A couple from Wakad gifted tiny resin table pieces shaped like lotus petals. Guests shared pictures of how they styled them at home. That’s the kind of impact intentional gifting can create.

# 7. Utility Gifts That Never Go Out of Style

Let’s be honest: the best gifts are the practical ones people actually use.

Here are guest favourites:

* Travel pouches
* Wooden trays
* Ceramic mugs
* Mini spice jars
* Steel water bottles

Practical gifts are evergreen because they fit every household.

# 8. Traditional Gifts Reimagined

Many families want traditional items but with a modern twist.

Ideas include:

* Custom mehndi cones in aesthetic packaging
* Mini brass diyas with engraved lids
* Haldi kumkum sets in contemporary boxes
* Silk potli bags with elegant floral prints

These options maintain cultural value while feeling fresh and relevant.

# 9. Theme-Based Return Gifts

If your wedding has a theme, matching the return gifts can elevate the entire vibe.

For example:

* A beach-themed wedding: sea-salt candles
* A pastel décor wedding: rose-scented soaps
* A Marathi traditional wedding: handcrafted torans
* A floral-themed wedding: mini dried flower bouquets

This creates coherence and enhances guest experience.

# 10. Custom Hampers for Close Family and Friends

If you want something special for inner-circle guests, curated hampers are a great option.

You can mix:

* Sweet treats
* A small keepsake
* A handwritten note
* A wellness item
* A practical accessory

Hampers make gifting feel personal and warm.

# 11. Gifts for Outstation Guests

If you’re hosting people coming from other cities, thoughtful return gifts can make them feel extra welcomed.

Some ideas:

* Maharashtrian snack boxes
* Pune-special items like bhakarwadis or handmade jewellery
* Local tea blends
* Mini travel care pouches
* Small cultural souvenirs

This not only delights them but introduces them to the local flavor of your celebration.

# 12. DIY Gifts That Show Effort

If you’re someone who enjoys creating things, DIY gifts can be incredibly meaningful and budget-friendly.

These could include:

* Handmade bookmarks
* Custom-painted bottles
* Scent sachets created at home
* Simple keychains

Even a small handmade element adds emotional value.

# 13. Budget-Friendly Yet Classy Gift Ideas

If your budget is tight but you still want quality, here are low-cost options that don’t feel low effort:

* Mini decor candles
* Compact photo frames
* Organic teas in small sachets
* Terracotta fridge magnets
* Minimal keychains made of jute or wood

It’s the presentation and thought that makes a gift feel expensive.

# 14. Presentation: The Part Everyone Forgets

Even the best return gift can fall flat if the packaging is poor. The way you present your gift matters.

Trending packaging ideas include:

* Kraft paper boxes tied with twine
* Floral-printed pouches
* Wooden crates for hampers
* Minimal transparent boxes
* handmade tags

Packaging enhances perceived value instantly.

# What Makes Guests Actually Appreciate the Gift?

Over hundreds of weddings, planners observe one pattern consistently: guests love gifts that feel personal, practical, or aesthetically timeless.

A return gift becomes memorable when it is:

* Thoughtfully curated
* Useful
* Unique
* Beautifully presented
* Connected to your wedding story

Choose something that reflects you as a couple. That’s the secret.

# Choosing Gifts With a Wedding Planner

Planning return gifts seems simple until you start doing it. Logistics, vendor coordination, quantity management, quality checks, packaging, and timely delivery require meticulous attention.

This is where an experienced team becomes valuable. A wedding planner can:

* Suggest ideas based on your theme
* Connect you to verified vendors
* Customize gifts within budget
* Manage packaging
* Handle last-mile logistics
* Ensure consistency in quality and quantity

This turns a stressful task into something effortless.

# Why Many Pune Couples Prefer Professional Planning Support

With wedding trends evolving rapidly in areas like Baner, Pimple Nilakh, Aundh, Wakad, and Viman Nagar, couples want their celebrations to be polished, meaningful, and guest-friendly.

A competent planning team helps achieve that without chaos.

One of the names couples often trust for such support is a [wedding planner pune ](https://www.weddingplannerpune.com/)known for blending creativity and execution perfectly.

1pc6heg,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/1pc6heg/eckhart_tolle_spoke_about_depression/,Eckhart Tolle spoke about depression,"[Speaker 7 : Questioner to Eckhart Tolle ] (5:12:08 - 5:12:56)
You, for this morning's talk—my mother died Friday, died on Friday. I just thought it was so appropriate, and the peace of mind that gave me with what you said this morning was fantastic.

But that wasn't my question. The question I had was really related to, with all the talks you give, the retreats and advice, have you ever looked back and thought afterwards, ""Man, I wish I wouldn't have said that,"" or, ""Boy, goofed up there,""—this was a mistake?

Thank you. Thank you. Well, only the...

[Speaker 1 : Eckhart Tolle ] (5:12:56 - 5:17:45)
Pope is infallible. Now, that the teaching—if we can even call it the teaching, of course—is not mainly based on information. Not primarily based on any kind of conveying of information or facts, but on its most fundamental level, the teaching is awareness, which is non-conceptual. So that can't be wrong.

So on the most fundamental level, nothing could possibly be wrong, because it transcends all concepts. That's the essence of the teaching. The moment you move into concepts, the possibility of error, of course, arises.

But first of all, the first level of concepts that are used are concepts that point back to that which is beyond concepts and beyond thought. So the concepts that I use in the teachings are concepts whose purpose is to point back to that which is beyond.

So they can't be much wrong about that, except that it could be that I used a pointer that perhaps was not the most appropriate one for a certain person or group of people. That could happen. But used again, ""errors"" doesn't really apply here; it just might not be the best possible point. I maybe wake up in the middle of the night to say, ""Oh, I could have said that."" That's maybe possible, but usually it doesn't arise.

Next level up, occasionally I let information slip in to illustrate certain things. I might talk about something historical, or might talk about some fact about something I read in the paper, or whatever—just as little illustrative stories.

And of course, that's where things occasionally get wrong. Even in The Power of Now, I wrote, for example, that 100 million people had been killed in the 20th century alone by other humans, and I later realized that the figure was much too low. Apparently, it's quite a bit higher—it could be 140 million. Nobody knows exactly. It's dreadfully high. And so I got that wrong.

Sometimes in talks, something may come in—a historical fact or something—and later somebody tells me, ""You got that wrong."" In one talk, I talked about depressed anti-deport—taking depressants, antidepressants—and I wasn't perhaps careful enough to emphasize that you should do this extremely slowly, with the help of a conscious physician and so on. There was one or two physicians in the audience who got upset, and this is all wrong, it's all wrong.

That's usually what happens. The answer to a question, or even the general talk, always—there's a correspondence between the questioner and the answer. Or when there's a talk, there's a correspondence between the energy field in the room and what comes out.

That's not decision-based. There's nothing in my mind that says, ""Oh, in this energy field, I'd better talk about that,"" because I don't know before the words come out what's going to come out. So that doesn't apply.

It can happen, though, that a person asks a question and an answer comes, and I later realize that the answer was not the deepest answer that I could have given. But I do know that the answer that comes out reflects the degree of openness in the questioner, usually.

And so if the answer is not that deep, then the question wasn't that deep. That seems to be often the case. Occasionally, some deep answer comes even when the question is not deep, but perhaps there's an intuitive realization. Then it is possible to break through the surface layer.

Questioner to Eckhart Tolle:

I take half of the smallest dose of Fluoxetine (Fluoxetine, sold under the brand name Prozac ) , an antidepressant medication. I have done without because I have a belief it will keep me from awakening. However, I have greater clarity and seem to hold presence more consistently when I continue with this small amount.

Eckhart Tolle answers:

A related question asks, do you think the huge increased consumption of antidepressants in recent years points to the ego's effort to suppress emerging consciousness? Of course, antidepressants are there because the pain gets too much, the pain of living, somehow an escape from the pain, dull the pain in some way. And eventually you have to face the pain and then realize that it's not as big as it seemed.

You've been running away from a monster. And if you really look at the monster, it's not such a big monster anymore. Facing it through presence, allowing that pain, whatever you want to call it, existential pain, the fear associated with it, the heaviness, allowing it to be there.

It may come in waves and then you watch the arising and subsiding of a wave of pain in whatever form. Antidepressants make it harder to be present. If you're on this very small dose, a time will come when you won't need that anymore and it may be very soon.

Some, it is often the pain body that manifests, as I described, the energy field of pain body, some energy field, some pain bodies have the energy field of heaviness, great heaviness to them. And they arise periodically. I had that.

My pain body was predominantly heavy, a weight I couldn't live with, a dull pain, continuous in the background. I might still be on antidepressants if I had taken antidepressants at the time. Somehow I must have allowed the pain to be there without knowing anything about allowing.

With presence growing and accelerating in you, face the pain that arises with that intense presence. And acceptance. And any state that arises, accept and watch it so that it doesn't turn into a self, an unhappy self.

If you accept and watch, any state arises is just that state now. That field, that energy field, that particular manifestation, that particular content arises. No self in it anymore.

The perpetuation of inner states is through them becoming a self, a me. Then they go on and on. You feed them.

You feed them. And you take time away, just what is now. So that whatever the emotional state is, the feeling state doesn't use your mind because if it uses your mind, you're back in time and you will be in past and future, which are both heavy.

And immediately the me arises out of that. So for that, you need the intensity of presence. Take a picture of an Isagadatta and look at that to get the quality of intensity.

Or the picture of a Zen, a painting of a Zen master, but better a photo of a master. And then see the uncompromising quality of presence. But it allows.

Uncompromising doesn't mean it doesn't allow. Uncompromisingly, it allows. It's uncompromising and allowing.

And anything that's faced will undergo change. We know that from dreams. We've all had dreams, running away from some monster or you're being pursued by some presence, some monster.

And when you finally face it in a dream, it's not that horrible. And often this is the myth. It becomes transformed actually into a benign figure, an ancient myth.

The famous, the dragon turns into something else or the frog turns into something, a prince. But you have to kiss the frog. Look.

Of course, you have to reduce very slowly if you are on entity presence, then careful and very alert and very carefully do it. Check within yourself, see if there's any waiting for the next question or this or that. Or whether there's such intensity of aliveness throughout your entire being that this moment is good enough as it is and more than good enough.

Is there a flight into thought as you sit there, which means into time, which means away from this, away from now, away from the aliveness, the intensity of this moment and the peace of this moment. What is the role of vision in creating a new world? Does vision arise out of presence?

Vision meaning you see something before it has manifested externally. The good thing is that you don't have to create a new world. It creates itself through presence. So you don't have to do it. There is no, in that sense, it's truer to say there is no free will. You are no more than an opening and the totality, the one consciousness expresses itself through you.

Is that the relief? You don't have to create a new world, but it'll create itself perhaps through you. And through presence, you may suddenly see what's needed.

Insight and realization comes, it's not egoic. There's no struggling and no effort in it. You will always know when there's effort, then there's no alignment with presence.

There's some ego involvement there. I need to get somewhere. I need to create a better world.

And so there'll be struggle. Effort means needing to get to the future. That's effort.

It doesn't mean that there may not be intense energy behind what you do, but it's not the energy of effort. Effort means you're being pulled towards future. But when something, when action arises out of presence, there may be great intensity and passion, you could say, but not the passion that needs you to reach the future.

The doing itself, it's the doing that arises is sufficient unto itself and there's joy, aliveness, and passion in the doing. It doesn't need the goal. Of course, in time, there's time in the phenomenal world, the doing will result in certain forms arising, new forms arise externally.

You don't need any of those for your salvation. You're not looking to the future for salvation. That means there's no effort anymore, but perhaps great intensity and great passion and great aliveness.

That's how the new world creates itself. So you may pursue a goal, but the arriving is not all that important. Not a goal that is going to free you, not a goal that is going to enhance your sense of self or your sense of importance.

Not in that sense. A good sign is when anything that arises out of presence, it means this moment is not a means to an end. The doing is fulfilled and fulfilling in itself, every moment.

You're no longer reducing the now to a means to an end, which is the old consciousness. And then very often you create, because you have a vision of heaven, and in pursuing your vision of heaven, you're creating hell. That's often happened.

There have been many visions of heaven and utopia. And in pursuing that, we need to get there, there. This is the ideal image.

Once we get there, we'll be fine. We'll be free. We will be whatever we will be. In the meantime, we need to adopt certain means towards getting there. Okay. We need to eliminate all those who don't believe in this goal to start with.

The madness continues. And this works on the smallest levels to observe any kind of doing in your life, movement from here to there, walking from here to there. Is it a means to an end, or is there a sense of completeness in the doing?

And you will notice the qualitative difference is tremendous between any action that's a means to a future end and an action that is not a means, but there's a sense of completeness to it. And yet there may be great energy there. We talked about eating.

Why many people lose consciousness when they eat is it's a means to an end. I need to get this food in through the body. There's no quality, no presence.

Even making a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, is that a means to an end? The tiniest things using them to see if you can be present with what is. It's never, the illusion in the old consciousness is the next moment is more important than this one.

Always, always the next moment is more important than this one. It does not mean that you have to slow down a lot, presence arising. We talked about that film I saw where those beings, everything they do is very slow.

And sometimes when presence arises, at first people try to do everything very carefully. And then there's a little bit of self-consciousness still there. Okay, I'm trying to be present.

And then you see, that's not quite it either. They're simple, reaching for glass. The glass is traveling to your mouth.

It looks like just a normal, just a normal action. And yet it's not a means to an end. And then a sense of presence pervades the entire energy field around you.

So any action that becomes a vehicle for presence, it's a vehicle for presence. And I think that's the beauty of the tea ceremony. As you know, they developed the tea ceremony in Japan originally so that basically means every movement is sufficient unto itself.

You're not moving towards the end result. You're just with what is. And that is the beauty.

It is possible that later it becomes a ritual and no longer works, there's certain deadness after a while that comes into a ritual and they may be performing the ritual, every movement is correct, but the presence is no longer there, that is possible too. But you will know that anybody with the slightest presence can tell the difference between somebody performing something like the tea ceremony or Tai Chi that requires intense presence. And you will know, I haven't learned Tai Chi, but I can watch Tai Chi and I know whether they're simply going through the movements and it may look fine on the surface, but the field of presence isn't there.

And somebody else going through the same movements and they see it emanates presence. And so that's the beauty of Tai Chi is that no movement is a means, you're not, when the arm moves from here, they're probably masters of Tai Chi here, so what am I talking about? But all I know is presence.

The hand moves from here to here and usually in your mind, you're already there. So the intervening movement or time period is a means to an end because the movement will have completed itself when it reaches there. So you're already mentally there and the hand is lagging behind.

So there's no presence, there's the projection of future that you're trying to get to. And then there's the possibility of moving in a way that at any stage of the movement, there's no movement into the future, there's continuous, you're not trying to get anywhere, just, and there's, that's the quality of presence flowing into it. And you could perform the same movement outwardly correctly, but you would have a mental projection there and the master would be able to tell or anybody, even if they know nothing about Tai Chi, would be able to tell that it doesn't, the emanation of presence isn't there.

But I, my feeling is that, I don't know anything about it, but my feeling is that presence, Tai Chi originated as spontaneous movement, presence expressing itself through a human being, in spontaneous, very slow kind of dance. And no movement was planned before. Nothing is, there's no, it moves with total nowness.

And simply one way in which presence can express itself, it can flow into. And so there was this, perhaps it was an old woman or an old man, or who knows, a young woman or a young man, suddenly moving and the few people around them saw, this is beautiful. What's he doing?

What's she doing? It was totally spontaneous. And then they said, this is so beautiful, we need to learn this.

And then gradually they started to see, okay, now he's lifting his right leg and then he holds it up for five seconds and then it goes down. So you can, you learn it by watching the spontaneity. Of course, now it becomes something learned, but even that can take you into presence.

It's not how it arose originally, my feeling is. And they, so they observed and then it became a technique, so to speak. But even the technique can work.

Although originally it came the other way around. Presence came and then it resulted in the movement. Now you perform the movement and the movement results in presence, if it works as it's meant to.

So we don't need to create a new world, that's good. Don't need to worry about that. Maybe I'll have one more question.

Thank you for choosing to share, choosing it in quotation marks. Thank you, it's good. Thank you for choosing to share your realization.

And that's, of course, you're present. As soon as you enter the body with your attention, you're present. But the question is, why do you prefer to teach a technique-less, to teach in a technique-less style?

As techniques go, Vipassana is wonderful. It's a wonderful meditation. For some reason, I don't teach techniques.

It seems that the power of the teaching or the power of presence is so strong as to not need the intermediary of a technique. That is perhaps the reason. So it's a direct pointing.

Just as Zen originally arose, totally no technique. And it was defined originally, Zen is direct pointing to the essence. Usually translated as heart, but direct pointing to the essence.

There's always the last step. Eventually, the technique is transcended, no matter how wonderful the technique is. And a technique, the drawback with usually a technique is that it gives you time to become good at it, to get better at it.

And steps, many stages or steps, many techniques have that. So that's the drawback. Even if the technique is designed to take you into the timeless, it might give you time to get there.

Many paradoxes appear when we talk about timeless and time. But that's how it is. A technique doesn't seem to happen here.

There's simply the power of presence. If privately you find a technique helpful, that's fine. Vipassana, whatever.

Some people practice the course in miracles. 365 lessons, one lesson per day. All designed to take you to the realization that there's no time.

That there's only the holy instant, as it's called in the book, only now. And if you could do one lesson, or even half a lesson fully and totally, you would be there. Even lesson one.

Of course, then you wouldn't need the lesson anymore. And the remaining 364 lessons. Being pure consciousness is so natural and simple, a state, at least I can see that.

Yet, since it is so very abstract too, how can you keep people from straining, mood- making, dividing the mind, creating expectations and beliefs, et cetera, while practicing the simple methods or portals that you offer? This first very important statement in the question, being pure consciousness is so natural and simple a state. It is natural and simple, a state of great simplicity, sometimes called in India, the natural state, your natural state.

And then the question says, yet it is so very abstract. No, it's not abstract. It's simple.

What's abstract is what follows. Dividing the mind, creating expectations, beliefs, mind streams, all that is a waste of abstraction. All of thought is abstraction.

Nevertheless, the question is valid. How do you keep people from straining? Well, I don't try to do that.

So the question is perhaps how do I keep myself from, and even that I wouldn't try to do. Simply watch, when we've been pointing to this, watch the movement of thought as it arises without being it, without being completely identified with it, be present. Do you have a choice?

We come back to the other question. Do you have a choice? Yes and no.

I would say yes, it's more helpful. I wouldn't say this to everybody because many people in this world, there's not yet, presence has not yet emerged to the point where one could say that they have a choice. And to many humans, it still applies what Jesus said.

They know not what they do. They know not what simply means something is operating through them and it's mechanical. They don't, they know not what they do.

They are not conscious. They don't know, forgive them, he said, of course. Somebody points out the psychotherapist that for people who suffer from certain biological illnesses it can be dangerous to go off antidepressants.

So great care needs to be exercised. Thank you, that may be important to mention. Some presence can arise also even when there's medication.

So whatever your situation is now, here you are, presence is arising no matter what. So here we are just alert, still allowing presence to arise and presence is here. And I seem to be saying this at the end of each retreat now and that is you're not really going anywhere from here. It just appears that you are. You never really go anywhere. The core, the field of now remains.

And around it, the scenery changes. There's the vastness of being and around it the pictures change continuously. So all you have to do is enjoy the scenery and enjoy the changes, the changing scenery.

So all this we already talked about that you can actually enjoy the fact that everything passes. There's a beauty in the coming and going of form. But only if you are the knower of the field that's underneath forms.

Then there's a beauty. There's a beauty in your own body getting old and you can enjoy that. There's a beauty even in loss of whatever kind.

You can enjoy that. So maybe the final message is that you don't have to do anything. In a way, the opposite of doing is what's required, allowing.

The new state of consciousness wants to arise. Presence wants to arise. It's allowing that vaster movement to express itself through you.

So there isn't anything really you have to do. How do you allow that new consciousness, that vaster movement to express itself through you? How can you be that hole in the flute?

What do you have to do to be a hole? Well, Jesus used a strange expression. He says, deny thyself.

People don't understand this. It's being misinterpreted. In other words, be selfless.

Be free of the illusion of the separate little me. Then you realize your essential nature is that hole, your no thingness. And then you're just an instrument of God, you could say.

Just it's expressive. God expresses itself through that hole. God, he, she, it plays.

So beautiful to be nobody, and yet everything. I'll ring the bell three times, reminding you of alertness, of the wakefulness. You want to read a poem?

Okay, after the bells. Would you like to read your poem? The microphone is coming.

We’re colleagues in a hospital in Asia, but we don’t work directly together.

A is introverted, gentle, and harmony-oriented — the type of person everyone seems to enjoy being around. She has a close friend group, and B and C are in that group too. They are colleagues I know but am not close to.

Over the last two months, our interactions have slowly increased. Nothing dramatic. Mostly small moments like her walking behind me in the hallway, following me out of conferences when I asked, or us helping each other with minor work tasks. Very low-stakes, friendly exchanges.

A few weeks ago, I tried to escalate a bit by inviting her to lunch. She accepted once, easily. After that, my 1:1 invitations didn’t land the same way. She never avoided me, but she didn’t accept my invites directly either. Once, right after saying she had already eaten, she invited me to join her group for a coffee break. Another time, she told me she was going with her group and asked if I wanted to join. Her group is close and often goes everywhere together anyway, so I didn’t read too much into it at the time — I blamed the hospital routines.

Today, I decided to take a clear step forward and invited her to coffee during a small break on Thursday. I texted:
“Let’s go to X café on Thursday.” Her reply completely knocked me off balance: “Yesss, I’ll invite B and C too!” I just replied, “OK sure.”

And now I’m so lost and confused. On one hand, she has never avoided me and always seems relaxed around me. On the other hand, she immediately and effortlessly turned my 1:1 coffee invite into a group event. You can probably guess by now that I don't have much romantic experience--a kind of forever alone guy. I’m disappointed and feel a bit sad because I thought she was slightly interested. Now I’m not sure if I misread everything. Is this simply her way of keeping things group-based and comfortable?

Does this usually mean she’s not interested romantically? Or perhaps she is so used to go together with the group so regularly and doesn't want to break the routine?",4,1764676187.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

1pc6dcy,https://v.redd.it/qy5oa3id3s4g1,Short Story: The Delhi Directive,"The Delhi Directive

The hum of the C-17 Globemaster’s engines was a lullaby Sullivan McAllister had known for twenty-five years. It was the sound before the storm. At forty-five, his six-foot-five frame, encased in a black tactical polo that did little to conceal the ripped physique of a man half his age, was a monument to disciplined habit. His hair, cropped short and peppered with gunmetal grey, was a stark contrast to the still-vivid blue of his eyes, eyes that had seen too much in places he’d rather forget.

Langley had been its usual sterile, urgent self. The briefing, delivered in a windowless room that smelled of stale coffee and anxiety, was stark. An international group, calling themselves “The Luddite Hand,” planned to disrupt the Global Tech Summit in New Delhi. Their rhetoric was anti-technology, anti-progress, a return to a purer age. Their methods, however, were brutally modern: a sophisticated, coordinated attack designed to kill thousands of delegates and executives and send the world’s economy into a tailspin.

“They’re not amateurs, Sully,” Deputy Director Crane had said, pointing at the holographic display of New Delhi’s sprawling convention center. “Their leader is a ghost. We have aliases, fragments. A man named Raza. Ex-Special Forces, Pakistan. Went rogue. He’s clever, connected, and he believes his own fanatical dogma. Your job is to liaise with RAW, plug into their intelligence apparatus, and stop this. You leave in two hours.”

Now, descending into the swirling heat of Indira Gandhi International Airport, Sullivan felt the familiar tightening in his gut. The mission was clear. The environment was not. India was a sensory explosion—a cacophony of car horns, the scent of spices and exhaust, a sea of humanity moving with a chaotic, vibrant energy that was the polar opposite of the controlled, silent halls of Langley.

The meeting at the Ministry of External Affairs was a dance of diplomatic niceties and veiled scrutiny. Senior officials in crisp kurtas offered warm welcomes and assurances of full cooperation, but their eyes were cautious, assessing the large American operative who moved with the quiet, predatory grace of a panther. They were proud, capable, and understandably protective of their turf.

It was then that she entered the conference room.

“Agent McAllister, this is Agent Priya Sharma. She will be your liaison and partner for the duration of this operation.”

Priya Sharma was not what Sullivan had expected. She was young, perhaps early thirties, with intelligent, dark eyes that missed nothing. Her hair was a long, dark cascade, tied back in a practical but not ungraceful ponytail. She wore a well-tailored linen blazer and trousers that, while professional, couldn’t hide a lean, athletic build honed by what Sullivan recognized as serious training. She was, by any measure, strikingly beautiful, but her beauty was sharp, like the edge of a finely crafted blade.

“Mr. McAllister,” she said, her voice firm, her handshake surprisingly strong. “I’ve been briefed on your file. Impressive.”

“Sullivan,” he corrected, offering a curt nod. “Let’s hope the file is the most impressive thing about this trip.”

The tension was immediate, a low-frequency current in the air. He was the seasoned, grizzled outsider, a bull being carefully guided through a delicate china shop. She was the brilliant, young native guide, tasked with babysitting the American bulldozer. On the drive to a secure safe house, the friction was palpable.

“Your agency’s intelligence on Raza’s possible locations is… broad,” she said, her tone neutral but laced with a hint of criticism. “We have more precise leads. The Luddite Hand has been recruiting disaffected youth from university engineering programs. Their idealism is being weaponized.”

“Idealism that ends with a bomb vest isn’t idealism,” Sullivan grunted, staring out at the chaotic flow of traffic. “It’s pathology. My approach is simpler: find the head, cut it off.”

“A direct approach. How very Navy SEAL,” she replied, a trace of sarcasm in her voice. “This is not a desert compound you can raid. This is a city of twenty million people. Subtlety is required.”

“Subtlety gets people killed when the clock is ticking, Agent Sharma.”

“Priya,” she corrected, mirroring his earlier tone. “And not if your subtlety is a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.”

For two days, they worked in a tense, professional detente. Sullivan’s field craft was unparalleled; he could break down a weapon blindfolded and identify the maker of a pressure-plate IED from fifty yards. But Priya’s network was her superpower. Her sources, cultivated from the bustling markets of Old Delhi to the sleek tech parks of Gurgaon, fed them a stream of whispers and clues. She moved through the city’s social strata with an effortless grace he could never hope to match.

The breakthrough came from one of her university contacts. A brilliant but withdrawn PhD candidate in robotics had gone missing. His specialty? Nano-drones and dispersion systems. The perfect delivery method for a chemical agent.

They tracked the lead to a decrepit textile mill on the outskirts of the city, a supposed relic of the old world being used to plot the destruction of the new. Their raid was a synchronized ballet of violence. Sullivan’s raw power and precision cleared rooms, his suppressed MP7 coughing quietly in the dark. Priya was his shadow, faster, more fluid, disarming two guards with a devastatingly efficient combination of Krav Maga and Kalaripayattu strikes that Sullivan had to admit was awe-inspiring.

They captured the PhD student, terrified and remorseful, but Raza was not there. The leader was always one step ahead. But they got a name. A location. A warehouse in the wholesale market, where the final device was being assembled.

They roared through the crowded streets on a borrowed Royal Enfield Himalayan, Sullivan driving, Priya riding pillion, her body pressed against his back for stability, a partnership forced by necessity. They arrived at the market to the sound of a high-revving engine. Raza, spotted by their perimeter team, was fleeing on a fire-red Ducati Panigale V4.

“Dammit!” Sullivan snarled, spotting a Yamaha MT-09 parked near a chai wallah. He tossed a wad of rupees at the startled owner, grabbed the bike, and looked at Priya. “You coming?”

Without a word, she swung onto the pillion seat, securing her grip around his waist. “Try not to crash. The traffic here is slightly more unpredictable than a Kabul road.”

What followed was an insane, pulse-pounding symphony of chaos. The Yamaha wasn’t the Ducati, but Sullivan wrung its neck, weaving through buses packed with people, dodging recklessly crossing pedestrians, and sliding past ox carts with inches to spare. Raza was a demon on wheels, using his raw power to force his way through gaps that seemed impossible.

Priya was his second set of eyes, shouting warnings and directions into his ear, her voice calm amidst the roaring engines and blaring horns. “Left! Left between the trucks! He’s heading for the flyover!”

The chase ascended onto an elevated highway, the city sprawling beneath them in a haze of heat and pollution. Here, speed was the only currency. The Ducati pulled away, its superior engine screaming into the distance.

“He’s getting away!” Priya yelled.

Sullivan’s jaw was set. He tucked in, becoming one with the machine, his world narrowing to the strip of asphalt and the red speck in the distance. He saw Raza look back, a arrogant smirk visible even from this distance. It was his mistake.

A loaded vegetable truck, its rear gate dangling open, pulled out half a kilometer ahead of Raza. A cascade of large, round cabbages spilled onto the highway, creating a rolling, green minefield.

Raza saw it too late. He hit the brakes, the Ducati’s rear wheel fishtailing violently. He tried to correct, to steer through it, but physics was a ruthless opponent. The high-sided sportbike lost all traction. It lowsided in a shower of sparks, then began a violent, cartwheeling tumble down the highway, metal screeching and fragmenting against the asphalt.

Sullivan braked hard, sliding the Yamaha to a stop fifty yards short of the carnage. They approached cautiously, weapons drawn. Raza’s body was broken, twisted at an unnatural angle amidst the wreckage of his machine and the scattered vegetables. The life faded from his eyes, the arrogant smirk forever erased.

The device was found at the warehouse, disarmed with minutes to spare. The summit proceeded without incident. The world never knew how close it had come.

Back at the safe house, the adrenaline finally receded, leaving a profound, weary silence. The tension between them had evaporated, burned away in the fire of the chase and the shared triumph. It had been replaced by a deep, resonant respect, and something else, hotter and more urgent.

Sullivan was cleaning his Sig Sauer when his encrypted satellite phone buzzed on the table. Langley. No doubt Crane, ready to debrief and issue the next directive.

He looked at the phone, then at Priya. She stood by the window, the lights of New Delhi glittering behind her, reflecting in her dark eyes. She had taken her hair down, and it fell around her shoulders like a curtain of night.

Their eyes met. No words were needed. The friction had found a new, potent form.

Sullivan reached over and silenced the phone, letting the call go to voicemail. The world, and its endless demands, could wait.

He crossed the room in two strides. She met him halfway. There was no more tension, no friction, only the inevitable collision. His hands, capable of such brutal force, cupped her face with a surprising tenderness. Her arms wound around his neck, pulling him down.

And as the chaotic, vibrant heart of India beat outside the window, the seasoned CIA operative and the brilliant RAW agent finally found a mission they could pursue solely for themselves.",1,1764675876.0,Indianmoviesonline,0,1.0,False

Franchisor is now requiring all franchisees to pay ₱100,000 for a “marketing initiative,” supposedly for an app launch. On top of that, they are requiring us to purchase a new POS system from them costing ₱35,000.

The ₱100,000 is non-refundable, and they did not provide any clear guidelines or explanation on how this amount will be used or how it benefits us. They also did not disclose who the POS provider is, whether it is BIR-registered, or whether the system complies with the required regulations.

Essentially, they want us to dispose of our existing POS, switch to their new POS, and repeat the entire BIR registration process, which will cause significant cost and operational disruption. It feels like a form of solicitation, and they are threatening to cancel our franchise contract if we do not comply.

My questions are:

 1. Is this legal?

 2. Can they demand ₱100,000 without clear mechanics or guidelines?

 3. Is it allowed for them to impose major financial requirements without prior notice or a reasonable lead time?

 4. How should we manage this situation? Because it seems very unfair and burdensome.

 I’ve occasionally been accused of checking women out but the truth is I’m checking their outfits and then dealing with a wave of frustration that always sweeps over me that they are free to express their femininity and I have to carry on trying to deal with being masculine. 

I get distracted imagining what they are feeling and how envious I am that they never have to crossdress to feel feminine , nor have the feeling of sadness at having to return to Manland.

1pc6233,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1pc6233/how_can_i_learn_to_trust_again_after_an/,How can I learn to trust again after an emotionally distant ex and feel ready to date? Or should I still wait?,"I was in a relationship for 9.5 months and we broke up in the very beginning of October. I ended it. He wasn’t a bad person, but being with him felt heavy in a way I never managed to shake off. There was this emotional darkness around him. Almost no lightness, almost no joy. Everything felt muted, like he was living life without any kind of warmth.

A big issue was his home and the dogs. He had two large dogs he loved, but he didn’t actually take care of them. They were never properly walked. They just went outside, pooped on the lawn, came back in, and that was it. Their paws were never washed. They were never bathed. So the whole house smelled like dirty dog.The floor was gritty. My throat felt irritated every time I was there. I felt constantly tense and uncomfortable in his space. When he stayed at my cleaner, calmer place, I always felt relief. My body was basically telling me that his environment was not a place I could ever feel grounded or safe.

On top of that, he was completely emotionally unavailable. He only liked talking about intellectual topics, work, theories, analysis. He acted like those were deep conversations, but they were all in the head. If I tried to talk about feelings, closeness, needs, fears, or anything about the relationship, he shut down instantly. He would say stuff like this is who I am or I like my life and I don’t want to change. If I offered any solution or compromise around dogs and life together (he offered me to move in with him many times), even small ones, he shut down. Every single time. It always turned into either you accept me as I am or we’re incompatible. That was his way of ending any emotional conversation.

Sex was also difficult. He never gave me oral, which made me feel like my pleasure didn’t matter to him at all. If I shared something I liked, he would say it wasn’t his style. He was very focused on BDSM, but in a disconnected, mechanical way. It didn’t feel intimate or playful or attuned. It felt cold and scripted. Sometimes I would tear up because I felt so unseen, and he never noticed because it felt like having sex with a robot.

Over time I felt myself shrinking. I felt like I had to adjust to his world but he never adjusted to mine. And even though I cared about him and liked certain parts of him, I could not picture a future where I would feel emotionally safe, seen, or fulfilled.

The reason it took me a while to break up with him was my empathy for him. I also have a strong appreciation for very accomplished men, and I tend to confuse discipline and structure with potential emotional safety and stability. He was an interesting person, and we had genuinely stimulating intellectual conversations, but that was basically all we had. Yet somehow, I felt so sorry for him that I think a part of me secretly hoped that if I just loved him enough, he would start opening up. I was trying to give him just a little more time. And then even more. And a few more weeks. But that was all false. It never happened. So I broke up with him after the last 2 months of a relationship negotiating with myself.

Since the breakup I’ve been healing. There are still sad days and flat days, but I know I made the right choice. I’ve been doing nice things again, starting to feel like myself, and sometimes people ask me out for coffee. I wasn’t ready before, but now I’m starting to think about saying yes. I want to believe there are men who are emotionally open, stable, warm, grounded, masculine in a healthy way.

My main question now is how to trust again? How to believe that emotionally available men exist, and how to spot them early while avoiding the ones who aren’t? This was too painful and I don't want to repeat it again. Any advice will be appreciated.",2,1764674776.0,AskWomenOver30,5,0.75,False
1pc60ui,https://i.redd.it/6o1k9jzrzr4g1.jpeg,CaptionIt - your photo our captions!,"Hello Reddit users! I want to share a cool app that my wife has been developing recently. Since she’s not a Reddit person, I’m making this post on her behalf.

The idea for the app was born pretty spontaneously. My wife loves Instagram, and most of her posts are photos rather than videos. To bring more story to a photo, she spends time writing a good or funny caption for each one. Later, ChatGPT came into play, but it has limitations on how many images you can process per day. So one time we were sitting, drinking coffee, and it hit us: it would be great to create an app that simplifies this whole process of posting photos to Instagram.

Over the next few weeks, we brainstormed how to make this app actually useful, not just another AI wrapper, but something with real value for users. As a result, the app using the latest ChatGPT model was born (believe it or not, not all the cheap models can do this job well).

What makes it different from a simple AI wrapper? Well, you can apply styling to your captions directly in the app, use custom fonts (which is pretty cool), easily reuse your previous captions, and start quickly with predefined moods. And last but not least, you can easily share your social media ready content, download it, or use the captions as stickers.

Personally, I don’t post on IG very often, but once I tried the app even me, an introvert, found it surprisingly fun, especially when generating captions in “Fuct Hunter” or sarcastic mood.

So if you find it interesting, give it a try. Sorry to Android users the app is currently available only on Apple devices.

I'm 25F and 8 months ago took ciprofloxcin (FQ antibiotic) for unconfirmed UTI. My problems started - fast forward since 6 months I have many pains, some of them shown on MRI some don't. I'm scared about my neck problems. Sometimes it's better sometimes worse, I am never fully painfree. After waking up I'm kinda stiff, then it gets a little better. If I overdo with walking, sitting in a wrong position (ignoring pain) it gets worse. I dont react to coffee or alcohol. Sometimes I had tinnitus in complete silence in my left ear. Pain migrates from a base of skull to level of C7 disc, sometimes is about muscles, tissues, sometimes I feel it's spine. I had headaches before spine issues.  I was running and swimming 3-4/week before FQ treatment and never felt neck pain (nor any other pain I experience now and it's A LOT). I walk, sit, lay down with pain. I did MRI on my neck and these are resultes:

\- shallowing of cervical lordosis

\- discrete reduction of the signal of the C3/4-C6/7 disc on T2-weighted images, slight degenerative changes

\- slight forward displacement of the C3 vertebral body

\- small bulges of the C4/c5 and C6/7 disc, modeling the dural sac to a small extent  
\- at the c6/c7 level, there is a prominent left-sided disc protrusion compressing the dural sac, with trace left-sided modeling of the ventral surface of the spinal cord

\- degenerative dehydration of the C6/7 disc with a slight decrease in its height and rupture of its annulus fibrosus

Can this heal with PT, or can I become asymptomatic? Do you use special pillow for sleeping? I cannot take NSAIDs or steorids due to this stupid FQ toxcicity. Will I be able to live painfree - running, swimming again? Do any of you have experiences with peptides or Red light teraphy, supplements? Any other advice, or word of hope?

The kind where I'm analyzing retention graphs while waiting for my coffee order.

My coworker says I need to relax. She's probably right.

But short form controls everything at this point. Growing a business? Building an audience? You've got 30 seconds or you're invisible.

The brutal part? I was legitimately terrible at it.

I'd spend entire evenings on one video. Write the script carefully. Shoot it multiple ways. Edit until it looked professional. Then post and barely hit 375 views. Copied successful creators religiously. Invested in their courses. Did exactly what they suggested.

Still stuck.

I genuinely started believing maybe I just lack whatever makes this work. Like certain people understand viral content naturally and my brain just doesn't.

Then I realized something important. I wasn't failing because I couldn't do it. I was failing because I didn't know what was actually broken. Just trying different approaches randomly hoping one would land.

So I changed everything. Stopped the random testing. Started tracking real data.

Pulled up my last 50 videos. Went through each one frame by frame. Noted exactly when viewers left. Discovered 6 specific issues destroying everything:

**1. I opened way too vaguely.** Starting with ""Wait for this..."" got me skipped instantly. But ""Drinking only water for 40 days made my skin worse before it got better and saved me $200"" actually stopped scrolling. Concrete details beat vague promises.

**2. Everyone bailed at second 5.** People make their decision between seconds 4 and 7 about continuing. I was creating buildup instead of showing value immediately. Now I drop my best moment right at second 5. Completely different results.

**3. Brief pauses looked like technical failures.** Tracked this carefully. Any gap over 1.2 seconds makes people think something's loading. What seemed like good pacing to me read as buffering to viewers. Cut way tighter than felt normal. Made massive impact.

**4. My screen stayed static way too long.** When visuals don't change past 3 seconds, brains just check out. Started rotating camera positions constantly. Cutting in different shots. Moving text around. Retention climbed from 50% to 70% just from this.

**5. Analyze your videos and learn from their feedback.** This is one of the things that helped me the most. I use an app called TikAlyzer that gives me feedback about my videos and tells me how to improve them so I can get more views.

**6. Nobody was rewatching my videos.** Algorithm pushes content people watch multiple times way harder. Started including text that moves too fast to catch once. Tiny details you spot on second viewing. Rewatch rate jumped from 8% to 31%. That's when views took off.

The real shift wasn't finding some magic formula. It was abandoning the guessing and measuring what happened every second.

Went from averaging 300 views to consistently hitting 15k in about three weeks.

If you're posting all the time but can't break 1k views, your content isn't necessarily bad. You probably just can't tell what's performing versus what you think is performing.

Sharing this because honestly the algorithm beat me up for months. Wish someone had just broken it down earlier. So that's what I'm doing here.",8,1764674384.0,ContentCreators,1,0.9,False

One of those habits is gratitude journalling – taking a few minutes to note what went well or what I’m thankful for at the end of the day.

Out of that came Daily Journal: Diary with lock ([https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-journal-diary-with-lock/id6754467750?ppid=ebce632e-6bcb-41db-b949-53637b968690](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-journal-diary-with-lock/id6754467750?ppid=ebce632e-6bcb-41db-b949-53637b968690)), a simple and secure space for daily gratitude, personal reflections, and memories.

My aim with this app was to make opening your journal feel calm and inviting, not like using another productivity tool. A few of the core things I focused on:

🔒 Truly private and secure: Your entries are for your eyes only. You can lock your journal with your device Passcode or Face ID, and all data is stored securely on your device.  
  
🎨 Customizable look and feel: You can change backgrounds, wallpapers, and fonts so your journal feels personal and matches your mood.  
  
🧘 Small wellness touches: If you want a moment to settle before writing, you can start a short guided breathing session or reflect on a Quote of the Day and then write what you’re grateful for.  
  
📱 Made for iOS: A clean, native experience built for both iPhone and iPad so you can write wherever you are.  


Pricing: Free

I’m a solo developer, and this has been a fun little passion project alongside my other apps. I’d really appreciate any honest feedback you’re willing to share. How does it feel for daily gratitude journalling? What do you like, what’s missing, and what could be improved?

I had a  career that felt exciting, friends who actually listened, hobbies that made me feel alive. Then I  got into a relationship that looked perfect on paper. He was calm, responsible, said all the right things, and at first I felt safe with him. What I did not notice, or maybe did not want  to notice, was how slowly I started shrinking myself to fit the version of me he preferred . It was never dramatic. It was small comments like why are you so emotional or why do you always need to talk about your day or I think you are overreacting again. Each time I would adjust  myself just a little, thinking maybe he was right and I needed to be quieter, easier, lighter . 

Over time I stopped sharing things that mattered to me. When something good happened at work I hesitated to tell  him because he would usually say something like well dont get ahead of yourself or you should be careful with that kind of excitement. When something bad happened he would tell  me I was being dramatic. I started writing things in a notes app instead of talking to him because it felt pointless. The version of me that used to celebrate things, that used to be  playful and curious, faded without me even noticing. It was like living in a house where someone keeps turning the lights down one switch at a time. Nothing feels wrong until you suddenly  realize you are sitting in the dark.   
The moment things clicked was so stupid and mundane that I almost laughed. I was out with coworkers and one of them  asked me what I do for fun and I had no answer. I literally sat there with my mouth open because I genuinely did not remember what I used to enjoy. I walked home replaying that  moment and something inside me snapped. I thought about how many times I apologized for existing too loudly, how many times I made myself smaller so he wouldnt sigh or say that tone  again. I thought about the person I was before him and how she would not even recognize me . 

Last week I told him I needed space and  he said I was being ridiculous. But I packed a bag and left anyway. I have been staying with a friend and every day another piece of myself comes back. I woke up yesterday and realized  I was humming for no reason. I made coffee the way I like it instead of the way he prefers . I sent a voice note to a friend without worrying someone would mock my voice . The air feels lighter. I feel bigger in my own body again.

I thought it would be simple. I like my niece and nephew, they are funny, loud in a kind of chaotic way, and I assumed helping for a week  would be tiring but doable. I went in thinking this might even be a nice bonding moment . What actually happened felt like a full scale reality check that hit me harder than any conversation about parenthood ever could. I left that house feeling like my brain had been spun in a washing machine and suddenly every vague idea I ever had about maybe someday wanting kids evaporated instantly. 

The first morning I woke up at six  because both kids were screaming over who got the blue cup. Not fighting over a toy or something valuable. A cup. One plastic cup. Then one of them spilled cereal on the floor and the  other stepped in it and started crying because it was cold. My sister looked like she had run a marathon before coffee. By lunchtime I had reheated the same pasta twice, cleaned three  spills, wiped two noses, mediated four conflicts and listened to a tantrum that lasted long enough for me to question the fabric of reality. People always joke about tantrums but being physically present for one feels like someone is slowly drilling through your skull with emotional  noise.   
By day three I understood something  I never understood on a gut level. Parenting is not a temporary job. It is not like helping for a week. It is a permanent, nonstop state of being needed. Every minute. Every hour. Even when the kids were finally asleep, the house felt like it was humming with leftover energy. There was no silence. No reset. I would sit on the couch thinking I might relax but then I would hear coughing or  running or the sound of a cupboard door slamming for no reason. At one point I tried to take a shower and one of the kids barged in to ask if penguins have birthdays. I remember standing there holding a towel trying to form words. My sister smiled in this exhausted way like this was all  normal. 

When the week ended I went back to my place and the silence felt  unreal. I sat on my bed and realized how deeply I value my freedom, peace and ability to choose how I use my time. I love my niece and nephew but loving kids is not the same as wanting  to raise them. Helping for seven days showed me what a lifetime of that would look like and it was the clearest answer I ever got. I dont want that life.

1pc5p45,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingBetterMen/comments/1pc5p45/dark_psychology_tricks_that_actually_work_use/,Dark psychology tricks that actually work (use wisely),"Ever notice how some people just *always* get their way? Like they can walk into a room, barely speak, and somehow everyone starts listening to them? I used to think it was just charisma or natural confidence. But after digging into behavioral science, persuasion psychology, and even a bit of social manipulation frameworks, the truth is way sharper: there are real, research-backed psychological tricks people use and many of them fall under what experts call “dark psychology.”

This isn’t about becoming a manipulative villain. It’s about understanding how influence actually works and how to protect yourself from it too. Most folks learn this the hard way: getting emotionally “played” in relationships, overlooked at work, or gaslit into questioning their own instincts. So I went looking for answers from real psychology books, negotiation experts, FBI behavioral studies, and even cult deprogrammers. And not those TikTok self-styled “alpha coaches” I mean actual peer-reviewed info.

Here’s a breakdown of the real strategies that actually *work*, and how to use them *ethically* to level up your life.

1. **Assume the frame, shape the outcome**  
Framing is everything. The person who sets the frame of the interaction controls the meaning of everything that follows. According to Dr. Robert Cialdini in *Influence* (NYT bestseller, over 5M copies), people unconsciously lean into the context they’re given. Example? If you ask, “How open are you to trying something different?” instead of “Do you want to try this?” you’re subtly shifting from yes/no to open/closed, which primes people to say yes. Salespeople, recruiters, and even therapists use this constantly.  

2. **Strategic silence is a weapon**  
FBI behavioral consultant Joe Navarro says in *What Every Body Is Saying* that silence increases discomfort in social situations, especially when combined with still eye contact. People rush to fill silence with explanations, apologies, or concessions. In a negotiation, just pausing even 5 seconds can pressure the other person into revealing more than they intended or softening their position. Learn to *sit in silence*. It freaks most people out and makes you seem more powerful.

3. **Leverage the “yes ladder”**  
This comes from the classic foot-in-the-door technique. Start with small, harmless agreements and build up. Research from Stanford shows if someone says yes to even *trivial* requests (“Can I show you one quick thing?”), they’re far more likely to say yes to a larger ask afterward (“Let’s grab a coffee and talk through your goals.”). It’s how cults and MLMs get people hooked.

4. **The power move of mimicking**  
Mimic someone’s body language *just slightly* and they’ll begin feeling rapport—even if they don’t consciously notice. This triggers what social psychologists call the “chameleon effect.” It feels subtle, but it builds a feedback loop of connection and trust. Use it sparingly or it gets creepy. This technique is also used in hostage negotiation and couples therapy (see: Chris Voss’s *Never Split The Difference*).

5. **Reverse psychology still works—but only when it’s subtle**  
Telling someone “you probably won’t like this” or “this isn’t for everyone” makes them *want* it more. Rebellion wiring kicks in. This works best with people who have strong independent identities. Apple's early “Think Different” campaign was built around this. You’re not telling people to *do* something, you’re telling them they *shouldn’t*, and letting their ego do the rest.

6. **Control attention, control reality**  
Dark psychology isn’t just words. It’s about attention. Propaganda researchers (like Jacques Ellul) found that whoever controls what people *notice* shapes their beliefs. If you constantly redirect conversations to certain themes (like loyalty, betrayal, ambition), you define what’s “important.” Over time, people adopt your values without realizing it. This is how manipulators isolate people, by shifting attention and emotional energy.

If you’re using these tricks, use them with intention. Influence without empathy quickly turns toxic. And if you want to *build awareness* so you don’t get played by someone else using these tools, here’s a mix of resources that helped me sharpen both my radar and my skills.

1. **Book: *The Laws of Human Nature* by Robert Greene**  
Massive book, but honestly, every page slaps. Greene (author of *48 Laws of Power*) dives into hundreds of historical, psychological, and social traps people fall into and how to navigate power dynamics without losing yourself. This book will make you hyper-aware of the games people play. Best book I’ve ever read on social manipulation. Felt like unlocking the Matrix.

2. **Book: *Influence* by Robert Cialdini**  
This one’s a classic for a reason. Used in sales, politics, even cults. Covers the 7 psychological levers (like reciprocity, authority, scarcity) that make people say yes, even when they don’t want to. What hit me hardest was how easily *everyone* falls for these triggers, even trained psychologists. Insanely useful read.

3. **Podcast: *The Hidden Brain***  
Shankar Vedantam hosts this NPR podcast on the unconscious patterns that drive behavior. One episode on how framing changes our perception of morality still messes with me. The show blends neuroscience, psychology and storytelling so you really remember it. Perfect for smart, quiet learning.

4. **YouTube channel: Derek Banas’ psychology breakdowns**  
He dissects complex psych concepts in 10-15 minute chunks. His breakdown of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and social engineering helped me spot toxic patterns early. Straightforward, no fluff.

5. **App: Think more clearly with Uptime**  
This app gives you short learning bursts from expert-curated courses. Real science, clean design. I used it to dive deeper into persuasion, negotiation, and behavioral psychology when I was overwhelmed by longer textbooks. Great supplement.

6. **App: Go deeper with BeFreed**  
This one’s wild. It’s an AI-powered personalized audio app where you can *talk* about life problems and it guides your learning based on that. You tell it something like “My partner always manipulates me emotionally but I can’t confront them,” and it pulls from books, podcasts, expert interviews, then gives you short audio advice like a friend who read every psych paper in existence. You can pause, ask follow ups, or go deeper into certain angles, like how to confront without triggering more gaslighting. Even better, it turns your learnings into flashcards so you can reinforce concepts. Made by Columbia U and ex-Google folks. Lowkey the smartest app in my lineup right now.

This stuff rewired how I interact with power, persuasion, and attention. Now I notice who’s framing the conversation. I can tell when a compliment is bait. I can redirect energy in arguments. Not to “win,” but to stay clear-headed. That’s the real edge.",1,1764673526.0,BuildingBetterMen,0,1.0,False

I am a 31 year old man. I work in tech as a Devops engineer in Bangalore. I'm looking for someone based in Bangalore, with whom I can be friends with first and then if we vibe, turn it to a long term relationship. 

I'm 5'11"", well built, active with workouts and play badminton. I look younger than my age. I love football, traveling and also trying my hand with cooking. 
I'm a non-vegetarian and I'm originally from Kerala. I don't have any restrictions on where you are actually from as long as you match what I'm looking for and live in Bangalore. 

My type of woman is someone who is emotionally intelligent, chatty, empathetic and can communicate well.
Prefer someone who is working, and can manage their own expenses. It doesn't mean you won't receive the occasional surprises but I want to ensure that you are someone who is financially stable enough to survive on your own. Also I prefer someone who is into fitness, if not already, then plan to be. We could be workout partners and hype each other up and grow together :) 

We could go out together, try out different variety of food, taste coffee, watch movies, travel to different places, and try out new things and experiences. 

I could say a lot of fancy things to attract you, but I would rather not do that and over commit giving you false hope. I would rather build a relationship with a strong foundation based on understanding and the person who you are. Loyalty and trust is important to me. 

If you feel like this interests you and matches the person who you are, feel free to reach out over DM with an introduction about yourself. 

P.S: Please don’t reach out if you already have a partner or looking for free therapy. Thank you!",1,1764673479.0,SFWr4rIndia,1,1.0,False

He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you’re into third wave coffee, perpetual curiosity, and the full spectrum of nerdy pursuits, this particular vertical human might be worth your time. Dating really does feel like job hunting sometimes, doesn’t it? LOL! You either get guys who hasn’t moved on with their exes, who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly one so I figured why not lean into the absurdity and write this like a bloody resume. The joke entertained me, at least.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine to get started.

**Edit, 11/22/2025**

Posting again to try to find the right match. I’ve connected with some great people through here, but the timing or connection hasn’t always worked out.

I’m hoping to meet someone who stays active, has self-assurance, maintains a healthy weight, and lives substance-free. I’d also like to avoid situations where someone is still recovering from a recent relationship, as I’m beyond the age where I want to be a transitional person for someone.

It would be helpful if we could share pictures relatively soon to gauge whether there’s physical chemistry before spending a lot of time getting to know each other.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1764673363.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.6,False

1pc5man,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1pc5man/best_vpn_for_digital_nomads/,Best VPN for Digital Nomads,"Picture this: You're working from a Bali café, about to send an important client proposal over public WiFi. A hacker on the same network intercepts your login credentials in seconds. Your bank account is drained by morning.

This nightmare scenario happens more often than you'd think. Digital nomads face unique cybersecurity challenges that most people never encounter—constantly connecting to untrusted networks, accessing banking from foreign countries, and working around government censorship. A quality VPN isn't just nice to have; it's essential infrastructure for your remote lifestyle.

After extensive testing and research across multiple digital nomad communities and cybersecurity sources, we've identified the five best VPNs specifically designed for the challenges of location-independent work. Whether you're prioritizing security, speed, budget, or privacy, this guide will help you choose the right protection for your nomadic lifestyle.

**Quick Answer:** NordVPN is the top choice for most digital nomads, offering the best balance of speed, security, and global server coverage at $2.99-3.59/month. But depending on your specific needs, one of our other recommendations might be a better fit.

# Why Digital Nomads Specifically Need a VPN

Remote workers face security threats that office workers never encounter. Understanding these risks makes the case for VPN protection crystal clear.

# The Public WiFi Danger Zone

When you connect to public WiFi in cafes, airports, or hostels, hackers can intercept traffic through sniffing, create fake hotspots (Evil Twin attacks), or execute man-in-the-middle attacks where your data is intercepted. That coffee shop WiFi isn't just slow—it's potentially dangerous.

Even if you rely on mobile data, depending on where you're located, you might face government surveillance or strict geo-blocks that prevent you from accessing certain websites. A VPN encrypts your connection, making it nearly impossible for anyone to see what you're doing online.

# Banking Access From Abroad

Banks often red-flag transactions and even block accounts if they see a foreign IP address trying to access an account. Nothing kills your productivity faster than being locked out of your bank account while traveling. A VPN lets you appear to be accessing your accounts from your home country, avoiding these frustrating blocks.

# Geo-Restrictions on Essential Tools

In some countries, sites like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Google are blocked entirely. If your work depends on these platforms, you need a VPN to bypass restrictions. Unlike many other digital nomad VPN options, some VPNs work in China and the UAE, which is critical if you're traveling through restrictive countries.

# Streaming Your Favorite Content

After a long workday, you deserve to unwind with Netflix or Hulu. But streaming catalogs vary dramatically by country. A VPN unlocks content from your home region, so you're never stuck with limited selections.

# Key Features Digital Nomads Should Look For

Not all VPNs are created equal, and digital nomads need specific features that casual users can ignore. Here's what actually matters when you're working from anywhere:

**Global Server Coverage**: The more countries available, the easier it is to access blocked services or appear local when needed. Look for networks spanning 60+ countries.

**Multi-Device Support**: You're juggling a laptop, phone, and maybe a tablet. Most VPN providers allow at least five devices per plan, with some services like Surfshark offering unlimited device connections.

**Speed and Stability**: A VPN should keep video calls smooth and file uploads steady. Protocols like WireGuard or modern versions of OpenVPN usually provide the best performance. Slow VPNs kill productivity.

**24/7 Customer Support**: When your connection drops at 3 AM before a client deadline, you need help immediately—regardless of time zones.

**No-Logs Policy**: All VPNs on our list have comprehensive security protection with features like a kill switch, IP leak protection, top-notch encryption, and RAM-only servers. Independent audits verify these claims.

**Mobile App Quality**: The first step is preparation. Always install and test your VPN before leaving home. Some countries restrict VPN downloads, so having the app ready in advance avoids unnecessary stress.

# Top 5 VPNs for Digital Nomads (2025)

We've tested these services extensively based on speed, security, server coverage, streaming capabilities, and real-world nomad use cases. Here's how they stack up:

3. **Configure**: Set up your devices with saved logins, enable the kill switch, and test a few servers for speed
4. **Test at Home**: Verify everything works before you travel—check streaming, banking access, and speed
5. **Use Consistently**: When connecting to public Wi-Fi abroad, turn on the VPN before entering sensitive information

# Common Questions from Digital Nomads

**Are VPNs legal for digital nomads?**

In most countries, yes. VPNs are perfectly legal for personal use, work, and online privacy. Many businesses even require employees to connect through VPNs. The only exceptions are countries with strict internet controls, where VPN use may be limited or restricted. Even there, travelers are rarely targeted for simply securing their own data.

**Will a VPN slow down my internet?**

Yes, but minimally with quality providers. All VPNs will impact your connection due to encryption and data rerouting, but a high-speed VPN will keep the slowdown to the minimum. The difference in speed is barely noticeable with a good provider. In our testing, speed loss ranged from 10-20% with premium VPNs.

**Can I use one VPN account on all my devices?**

Yes. Most VPN providers allow at least five devices per plan. Some services like Surfshark even offer unlimited device connections, which is ideal for nomads who travel with several gadgets or share with a partner.

**What about free VPNs?**

Avoid them. Free VPNs are dangerous—they've been caught selling user data, allowing malware on their networks, and leaking your location and identity. The only exception is ProtonVPN's free tier, which is legitimately secure but has speed and server limitations.

**Do VPNs work for streaming Netflix abroad?**

Not every VPN can bypass streaming restrictions. Platforms like Netflix and Disney+ actively block VPNs. However, the top providers ExpressVPN, NordVPN, and Surfshark consistently unlock content from different regions. All our recommended VPNs work with major streaming platforms.

**Can I access my bank account with a VPN?**

Yes, and you should. VPNs solve the problem of banks blocking foreign access. Connect to a server in your home country, and your bank sees a local IP address instead of a suspicious foreign login.

**What if a VPN doesn't work in a specific country?**

Occasionally VPNs face restrictions in certain regions. If this happens, you can contact support for working server options. Quick chat with support usually provides solutions within minutes. Most premium VPNs offer obfuscated servers specifically designed to bypass VPN detection.

# Final Recommendation: Start Risk-Free

Here's the bottom line: Being a digital nomad means balancing freedom with responsibility. Your work, finances, and personal connections depend on staying online in a safe and reliable way. A VPN is more than a piece of software—it's a tool that protects your lifestyle.

**Our Top Pick: NordVPN**

For most digital nomads, NordVPN offers the best combination of speed, security, global coverage, and value. It's capable, offers superb streaming functionality, strong security, and numerous high-speed servers, plus a 30-day money-back guarantee.

**Best Budget Alternative: Surfshark**

If budget is tight or you need unlimited devices, Surfshark delivers incredible value at under $2/month without sacrificing essential features.

**Take Action**

Every VPN we've recommended offers a 30-day (or 45-day) money-back guarantee. This means you can test the service risk-free before committing. Don't wait until you're locked out of your bank account or have your data compromised on public WiFi.

The small monthly investment in a quality VPN pays for itself the first time it prevents a security breach or keeps you productive in a restrictive country. Your digital nomad lifestyle depends on reliable, secure internet access—make sure you have it.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1pc5jn9,https://i.redd.it/bblkrxauur4g1.jpeg,All of my current tea utensils and their backstories,"  The sieve is probably the oldest one. I've used it long before I've started drinking actual tea. I've used it for straining coffee before, but now it's used for stopping small particles of tea from coming into the drink. Although, I'm not sure where I've got it from. 

  The bigger cup/tea bowl (the one with weird looking chinese characters and pictures) was bought in a flea market here in my hometown of Riga, Latvia 🇱🇻. The seller told me that it's for alcohol like sake, and before tea I used it for sauses, but now I use it for tea (and sometimes sauses). 

  The teapot and the smaller tea bowls were in a set. I've got them recently in Pärnu, Estonia 🇪🇪 (before them, I've used my normal everyday 300 ml cup like a barbarian). I don't think it can be seen on the picture, but the teapot and the tea bowls are covered in small cracks. I know it's a specific pottery technique, I know it's name as it was brought to my native language (Russian), Жу Яо (Zhu Yao), but I'm not sure it's called the same in English, because I've tried to search Zhu Yao pottery to no avail. Anyways, I've got it in Pärnu, in the shopping mall ""Port Artur"", specifically in the second, smaller building of the mall, in the shop that can be seen right from the entrance, right in front of you when you enter. It's a shop that sells a lot of shamanic stuff like crystals, incense, some ethnic music instruments and other things, which I don't practice, but I like the shop anyways because it's interesting and I can also find things for myself, like teas, essential oils or notebooks. There were teapots there as well, so I got one for myself. There were lots on interesting ones, but I chose this one for its size and beauty. 

  Last but not least, my Gong Dao Bei. I've got it here in Riga as well. Nothing much about it, I've bought it (for cheaper than I expected) and was very happy about it. It now serves it's duty as a champ.

Bike will mostly be used here in the UK for daytrips to get coffee somewhere, not used for long vacations and stuff, and it will only be me using it, wifey is not interested in pillion duties.   
  
Last bike was a GPZ1100 when I was 20. Now looking to choose between those two mentioned above. Money seems to be more or less the same for both.  
  
""Concerns"" and considerations vary from day to day, but usually boils down to the fact that I always preferred a sportsbike over a more ""sensible"" one.  
  
I want that power to be there when I want it, and I know that I would get bored if I got a ""meh""-bike just because it ""makes sense"" (me getting older, ""you don't need that kinda horsepower on the street anyway"", and so on)...

Disclaimer - I haven't tried any of these bikes yet, so what I know about them is purely based on reviews on Youtube and websites. I will obviously try them out before getting one or the other, but what I'm trying to avoid here is ""yeah, I made an 'adult' decision and went for the sports tourer, but it's not really that fun, and now I regret it"", or ""yeah, I got the sports bike, but now I realize it was a bit overkill, and I'm not 20 anymore""....

1pc5est,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1pc5est/im_not_sure_what_to_do_about_my_neighbor/,I'm not sure what to do about my neighbor,"He's a childhood friend of my mom's and her siblings, so they all knew him as a not very bright kid but they all still played together. It's kind of a tight community and people know him as nice and quiet but boy are they wrong! He's mentally and emotionally underdeveloped so he doesn't exactly care about appropriateness and age. About 10ish years ago when I was in my early 20s he would quite often have coffee with my mom and her friend or my uncle so he didn't seem like a stranger or a danger. Around that time he'd invite me for a coffee too, with my mom or alone. 

I guess most people feel sorry for him because it's obvious he's not too savvy about life in general, and he's doing fine mostly because all his siblings live nearby and control a lot of his decisions. Despite that he makes good money at his manual work which makes him look like a ""normal person"" with a nice house and car.

Now these past years he started being obsessed with me and trying to talk about gross sexual stuff which I ignored completely so he stopped. For the most part. However he's still always around staring at my house. He'll take walks or bike rides and patrol. Whenever I'm outside doing something he can hear it and he cracks open the door and spies on me. Sometimes I'll make noise on purpose then hide just to see if he's gonna open that damn door and he always does. I mean he's not invisible, I wear glasses and can still see him without them, as can everyone else. I told my parents and friends and we're all disgusted but apparently there's nothing to do.

The thing that concerns me is, I suspect he's autistic and obviously he's intellectually slow but that's not an excuse for being openly borderline pedo. He has no shame about stalking socials of young girls and talking about them constantly, plus making disgusting misogynistic comments about them but especially grown women who aren't to his liking.

And finally the worst part whenever I have the misfortune of talking to him, he is seething with rage. I can't even explain it, he's full of sighs and scoffs and curses of all kinds for no good reason. He lives a comfortable life. No responsibilities. Yet he's boiling. I've never seen a sober person with that much anger waiting to explode. And I feel like that's going to escalate soon. I'm not exactly worried about myself in that scenario but it is in the back of my mind, just in case. 

So do you think it's best to stay away until this whole thing plays out? 

  
Why didn't we all cut contact, it's because we're dumb people and you don't abandon someone you've known forever just because they might do something but didn't do it yet.

1pc5dq3,https://i.redd.it/y4r8gcv1tr4g1.jpeg,At Toji's Place Male Pov Part 1,"The late evening sun hung low over Tokyo's sprawling skyline like a bruised peach bleeding into the horizon, casting long shadows across the cracked sidewalks of this rundown apartment block on the city's frayed edges—where the hum of salarymen shuffling home from overtime jobs mingled with the distant wail of ambulances slicing through the humid air. 

You'd arrived at Toji's door after a cryptic text exchange that had your pulse racing all day: ""Come over. Got something for you."" No pleasantries, no bullshit—just the raw pull of his voice in your mind, that gravelly timbre promising the kind of edge-of-the-knife thrill only he could deliver.

 At twenty-something, you were no stranger to the underbelly of Jujutsu society's fringes, drawn to men like Toji who operated outside the cursed energy bullshit, all muscle and menace wrapped in a smirk that could unravel you. Your knock echoed hollow against the chipped paint of the door—*thud-thud*—heart thumping in sync, palms sweaty against the frayed denim of your jeans as you shifted your weight, the faint scent of street food vendors wafting up from below like a greasy lure.

The door swung open with a creak that cut through the tension like a blade, revealing Toji in all his predatory glory: towering frame filling the threshold, shirt already discarded to expose the scarred expanse of his torso—broad pecs etched with old battle wounds like a roadmap of violence, abs ridged and flexing subtly under pale skin taut as drumhide, a faint sheen of sweat glistening from whatever workout he'd just finished.

 His dark hair was tousled, falling into eyes that pierced you with lazy amusement, black and bottomless, like voids swallowing light. At thirty-something, Toji was a force of nature—legs like tree trunks clad in loose sweatpants slung low on his hips, the V of his pelvis a shadowed promise leading down to the thick bulge tenting the fabric already, as if he'd been anticipating this as much as you. 

A cigarette dangled from his lips, smoke curling up like a serpent's tongue, and he exhaled slow, the haze parting to let his grin flash—sharp, wolfish, with teeth that gleamed under the hallway's flickering bulb. ""Took you long enough,"" he rumbled, voice low and rough like gravel under boots, stepping aside with a jerk of his head to invite you in, the motion casual but commanding, his free hand clapping your shoulder hard enough to jolt you forward. ""Get your ass inside before the neighbors start sniffing around.""

The apartment was a sparse den of controlled chaos: dim lighting from a single lamp casting warm pools over threadbare furniture—a sagging couch scarred from knife fights or worse, a low coffee table cluttered with empty beer cans and a half-eaten takeout box, the air thick with the musk of unwashed sheets from the open bedroom door and the underlying tang of Toji's cologne, sharp and metallic like gun oil. 

No cursed tools in sight, just the raw physicality of the man himself, walls bare except for a faded photo of some forgotten life pinned crookedly above the sink. He kicked the door shut behind you—*bang*—locking it with a decisive *click* that sealed you in this private arena, his presence filling the space like a storm front rolling in. 

You barely had time to mutter a greeting before he was on you, crowding your personal space with that effortless dominance, cigarette stubbed out in an ashtray with a hiss—*fsss*—his hand fisting the front of your shirt to yank you closer, breath hot against your ear. ""You look tense, kid. Been thinking about this all day, huh? Bet your cock's been twitching since you got my text."" His laugh was a dark chuckle, vibrating through his chest as he shoved you toward the couch, the cushions sinking under your weight with a muffled *poof*, Toji looming over you like a colossus deciding its next conquest.

He didn't waste time on preliminaries—sweatpants shoved down in one fluid motion, kicking them aside to reveal the full, heavy length of his cock springing free: thick as your wrist, veined and curving slightly to the left, the head a flushed plum already leaking a bead of pre-cum that caught the light like a pearl. 

But he wasn't rushing; no, Toji savored the build, his eyes raking over you with predatory hunger as he dropped onto the couch beside you, long legs stretching out to prop his bare feet on the coffee table—feet large and callused from years of barefoot brawls and high-stakes chases, soles rough with faint scars, toes flexing lazily as if testing the air. 

""Strip,"" he ordered, voice a lazy drawl laced with command, leaning back against the armrest with arms folded behind his head, biceps bulging like coiled ropes. You complied, hands fumbling with your shirt and jeans—fabric whispering to the floor in a heap—until you sat bare before him, cock already half-hard and twitching under his gaze, the cool air of the apartment raising goosebumps on your skin. Toji's grin widened, a flash of teeth that sent a shiver down your spine. ""Good boy. Now, get over here. We're starting slow—gonna make you earn it.""",2,1764672398.0,FreakyKaisen,1,1.0,False

my wife and I like to drink Nespresso Lungo but we don't like the capsule waste that much. Now i'm considering buying a Sage Oracle Jet as a replacement.

We like the drink each a couple of coffees a day, we are not baristas and drink coffee black. We considered to buy a full automatic like a Jura but we like the traditional touch of an espresso machine.

From the videos it seems that the Oracle Jet is quickly heated and the work seems to be manageable to get a coffee out. The touch screen seems to be responsive, an absolute must for a new device, and it's quiet (no fan) like on the Oracle Dual Boiler.

Considering we are drinking mostly Nespresso Lungo, will we be disappointed with the OJ or is this going into the right direction?

Your ADHD brain just needs different shit at different times. 3 daily anchors + rotating tasks that actually stick,"For years I genuinely thought I was just broken. Like I'd wake up all motivated, thinking “okay TODAY I’m gonna be productive fr” and I’d try doing morning meditation or whatever. Day 1? Amazing. Day 2? Fine. Day 3? I want to yeet my phone out the window because doing the EXACT same thing again feels like my brain is being punished.

So then I’d be like “okay screw routines, I’ll just go with the flow.”  
Yeah… that lasted like 48 hours before everything turned into chaos and I accomplished absolutely nothing except stressing myself out lol.

At night I’d literally sit there like… why can’t I just be a normal functioning human?? Why does everything either get boring instantly or spiral into mess?

Anyway, eventually I realised something that kinda changed everything for me (and ngl made me feel a lot less like a failure):  
I’m not lazy. My ADHD brain just needs structure AND variety at the same time. If things are too rigid, I die inside. If things are too flexible, I fall into a black hole of chaos. Like I need both or my brain just taps out.

And the first thing that actually helped was figuring out what I was EVEN struggling with.  
For me it’s focus + time management. I know what I need to do but starting? Impossible. Staying on one thing? Also impossible. I’d be “busy” all day but not actually doing anything that matters.

Once I understood that, I stopped trying random productivity tips that work for “normal” people and started picking stuff that directly targets MY issues instead of trying to copy someone else's perfect morning routine.

So here’s the system that weirdly worked (and I've tried literally everything so I was shocked):

Basically I have 3 things I do EVERY day. Same time, same thing, non-negotiable. These don’t change.  
Then everything else rotates so my brain doesn’t get bored and bail.

**My 3 daily anchors (aka the only stable part of my life lol)**

Morning: Stand near sunlight + drink water for 2–5 minutes. That’s it. No pressure. Just “hey brain, we’re alive, let’s wake up.”

Work: Look at my calendar before doing ANYTHING. Takes 2 mins and stops me from jumping between 5 random tasks like an unmedicated squirrel.

Evening: Write down ONE win on a sticky note. Even if it’s tiny like “replied to 3 emails” idc, it counts. Makes me feel like I didn’t completely flop the day.

These happen every day and because they’re stupidly simple, I actually do them.

**The rotating stuff (the part that keeps my brain from quitting)**

Each day has different “extras” depending on morning/work/evening. Like:

Morning extras:  
– Monday: write 3 things I’m grateful for  
– Tuesday: 2-min body scan  
– Wednesday: set 3 intentions  
– Thursday: drink coffee mindfully (no phone scrolling trap)  
– Friday: light stretching

All of these basically help me start my brain without overwhelming myself.

Work extras:  
– Monday: brain dump during lunch  
– Tuesday: two-minute rule  
– Wednesday: desk stretches  
– Thursday: 5-min walk  
– Friday: check if I’m doing actual important stuff or just fake-busy

Same goal (focus/time mgmt), but different vibes every day.

Evening extras:  
– journal a bit  
– write priorities for tomorrow  
– gratitude  
– what I learned  
– quick week review

Again, all for winding down but not the same boring thing every night.

And idk how to explain it but this combo of “same base” + “different details” just… works?? Like it’s the first routine I haven’t abandoned by day freakin’ 3.

I think the reason it works is because the anchors give my ADHD brain stability and remove decisions.  
But the rotating activities keep the dopamine alive.  
And also different times of day need different vibes.  
Morning brain = needs gentle activation.  
Work brain = needs structure + focus.  
Evening brain = needs calm + closure.  
Trying to meditate at 2pm when I’m supposed to focus never worked. Trying to do deep work when I just woke up also made no sense.

Anyway, I’ve been doing this for like 3 months which honestly is a record for me. If every routine you try dies immediately, maybe try the whole “structure + novelty” thing.

Idk if this makes sense or if it’s just my weird ADHD brain but… does anyone else need BOTH stability AND change at the same time?? Or am I alone in this chaos?",2,1764671390.0,AdultADHDSupportGroup,1,1.0,False
