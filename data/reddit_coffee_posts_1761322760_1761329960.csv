Me (32m) and my SO (34F) and are getting married February next year. Been together nearly 8 years. I absolutely love that woman, and we work so well together. But her brother in law has always been a pain in the ass from the start. 

He very quickly decided for some reason that the best way to deal with me is to just pretend I'm not there: if i ask him a question or how he's doing, he won't respond. He'll talk to other people around us exclusively, such as his wife, his sister, mother and family friends. 

It's gotten to the point I know there's other people who have mentioned it to him. But he doesn't care. I've tried to have a conversation with him at least once, but we've never even had that. The most important ever got was how I was doing and whether I wanted a coffee once. 

Things got quite stressful during the covid pandemic, as he was getting married in that time, so when he had to reduce numbers he uninvited me and asked my mother in law to be to tell my SO. This devastated her and me. Yes, he had to reduce numbers, but it conveniently turned out I was the only partner who wouldn't be invited as a plus one at that point. I was then reinvited when numbers and wedding restrictions lifted and seriously considered not going. But I went as my SO begged me. 

Since he and his wife have had children, I feel more tense. I don't feel welcome at his home, I know his wife tries to talk to me to include me in things, but it just makes things awkward when he clearly tries to have conversations in the room with others as if I'm not there. He tells his children to hug his sister and doesn't mention me. 

I've heard what he says when I'm not around, but not all of it. About how it's not natural for families to have same sex parents or how immigrants are taking over the country and the nation is losing it's way, or jokes about mixed race couples But since none of it is ever mentioned when I'm around, I'm limited in what i can do. 

The prospect of having to endure this for the rest of my life is a wearying one. I have spoken with my partner about it, and it upsets her. I feel awful as she wants him to come to the wedding, and i don't anymore, even if he won't have an active role in it. I feel I've been treated invisibly for too long to want him there, and she says she can't help how he acts but since her father passed away 10 years he's the last link she's got to him. She has suggested asking him not to come with great effort, but then that means our sister in law won't come. 

So, how do I resolve this? This piece of shit is coming to the wedding. I've cut out others from the RSVP list who have treated me poorly this year, but he's exempt. How do I just accept it? 

TLDR: my brother in law to be has acted for nearly 8 years as if i don't exist. How do I just accept that's the way things are going to be? Nothing i can do will resolve it without ripping up family dynamics. ",1,1761329870.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

People will read 2,000 words if every paragraph earns its place, and they’ll bounce in 200 if you waste the first line.

The real key is pacing. Lead with the hook (what made this problem interesting), get to the tension fast (what was broken or risky), and resolve it cleanly (what changed and why it mattered). Everything else is optional.

I’ve found the sweet spot for online readers is around 600–1,000 words, enough space to tell a real story, short enough to read over coffee. Add clear subheads, one strong visual, and a quotable insight, and it’ll feel shorter than it is.

So, don’t trim for length, trim for energy. A great case study doesn’t end when it’s “done,” it ends when there’s nothing left that makes the reader skim.

1of56os,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1of56os/rf_the_day_i_towed_a_sedan_and_accidentally/,[RF] The day I towed a sedan and accidentally became a neighborhood legend,"I never thought I’d be the type of person who called a tow truck. I’m usually the “let’s talk this out over coffee” kind of neighbor, but sometimes suburban peace needs a bit of chaos to stay balanced. This all started with a silver Honda Civic that apparently believed my driveway was a public attraction. It wasn’t just parked there once. Oh no, this car had commitment issues—it kept coming back like a bad sequel.



The first time it happened, I left a note on the windshield that said, *Hey, friendly reminder this is private property. Please don’t park here. Thanks!* The next morning, I found my note crumpled up on my lawn with a small doodle of a smiley face. I tried to be understanding. Maybe they didn’t see it. Maybe it blew away. Maybe I was being too sensitive about my own concrete rectangle.



The second time, I decided to talk to my neighbor directly. The car belonged to his daughter, who had just gotten her license and apparently thought my driveway was the perfect “practice spot.” I asked politely if she could avoid parking there. He smiled, said “Of course,” and promised it wouldn’t happen again. I believed him. I’m an optimist. That was my first mistake.



A week later, I woke up at 8 a.m. ready to go grocery shopping and there it was again. Silver. Shiny. Mocking me from ten feet away. Blocking my car in like it was marking territory. I could practically hear it whisper, “What are you gonna do about it, pal?” That morning, I realized something crucial: diplomacy had failed. It was time for action.



I called the local towing company. The guy who answered sounded way too excited, like he’d been waiting his whole life for this moment. “Oh yeah, we’ll take care of it,” he said, chuckling. “Address?” Twenty minutes later, a tow truck pulled up, big and bright yellow, humming like justice itself. The driver stepped out, took one look at the car, and said, “Sweet. Easy hook.”



I won’t lie—watching that Civic being lifted off my driveway was satisfying. Like years of quiet frustration being pulled into the sky. I stood there with my morning coffee and nodded as if I’d just signed a peace treaty. The driver gave me a thumbs-up and left. I went inside, feeling lighter than air.



Two hours later, the neighbor came knocking. Hard. His face was a shade of red I didn’t know skin could reach. He shouted that I had “embarrassed” his daughter, that I should “have some decency,” that I’d “gone too far.” I calmly reminded him that she’d been told several times not to park there. He demanded I pay the towing fee. I pointed out that I wasn’t the one who violated parking law. That didn’t go over well. He stormed off, muttering something about “neighborhood councils” and “revenge.”



Then the group chat started. Apparently, someone filmed the tow truck. Within an hour, I had messages from three neighbors saying things like “Finally!” and “Good for you!” One even brought me a muffin basket. A kid down the street called me “Tow Guy.” The nickname stuck. For the next week, people waved when I walked by. Someone even left a little toy tow truck in my mailbox as a trophy.



By the end of the month, I was a local legend. The Civic never came back, the driveway stayed clear, and I learned that sometimes, doing the right thing means being a little bit petty. I didn’t set out to become famous in my own cul-de-sac, but life’s funny that way. Every time I see a tow truck now, I salute it like an old friend.



And if you’re wondering what happened to the neighbor’s daughter—she parks perfectly fine these days. In her own driveway.",1,1761329791.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1of53pe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1of53pe,Variegated money tree care help,"(Main question: I’d love help building a game plan of what my plant needs to thrive. The rest of the info in this post is the plant’s history)


The first picture and the last 3 pictures are 3 years apart. I’ve had this guy for maybe 4 years? He was an impulse buy back when I had no money, and is my most expensive plant. I have no idea how fast they grow, but I’d assume mine is growing slower because of the care it gets. 

I only recently removed it from the moss it lived in for years. It shipped to me in moss in the clear pot, so I kept it in it until a few months ago when I was planting some pothos water props to get rid of random bags of dirt and moss (I tried putting a Swiss cheese plant on a moss pole for the first time ever and had way more moss than I needed) 

Now I’m sure y’all will cringe at the soil… idk what I’m doing. So I removed it from its pure moss pot, and mixed the moss with fresh cactus soil,  and a random pot of dried dirt from the porch… and I hoped for the best cuz she hadn’t even had soil and was doing fine. 

Comparing the current photos with the old ones she’s not nearly as dark green and variegated today… but the lighting situation has changed. 

When I first got my kitten (now 2) the plant was sitting in my room near the windowsill. And then Cashew (the cat) started hole punching every leaf till they were all damaged. So I moved my little plant up on top of my parent’s fridge and there it lived, half forgotten for 2 years. And it did great. It grew taller, and was bent up against the ceiling… I’d water the moss when it was dry, inspect it, and put it back. But then I got a boyfriend and moved my plants out of the house to his place where I stay. The house lighting is much different (no more artificial kitchen lights for the money tree) and I’ve moved my little tree to the coffee table in the living room where it gets south facing light (idk much about lighting… but I know that window gets bright morning light, if I open the blinds for it. The boyfriend doesn’t like leaving blinds open or lights on when no one is home, and we both work full time so that’s most of the time. Maybe it needs to go back to my parents house and live on top of the fridge until I get MY own place with my plant chomping cat 🥲) 

Dead leaves: it occasionally drops leaves. They’re always see through and faint brown. It’s sometimes the whole star of leaves, but usually it’s just one leaf from the star. Idk what that means. It’s never droopy (I’m comparing it to a pothos, despite them being completely different plants), but now it has a woody stem (when I got it, it was so tiny and fragile. The whole thing was bendy, and it had like 5 stars of leaves total! So cute) so I don’t think it can droop much. It always unfurls it’s leaves (as opposed to my Swiss cheese plant which won’t if it doesn’t get enough water) 

It could probably use some fertilizer, because I’m sure the soil I gave it isn’t the best. And honestly I could go out and buy special potting soil for it in general, but I’d love help building a game plan to give it the best possible outcome! ",2,1761329596.0,houseplants,0,1.0,False

They’re Fighting Mad and We Should Be Too.,"If you’re scrolling past the Starbucks union fight, you need to wake up. This isn't some petty drama over coffee; this is a kick in the teeth to every single working person who has ever been pushed too far. We are angry, and this story is exactly why.
The sheer insult here is the burnout grind they're forced into. You know the feeling: that red-hot frustration when you're busted trying to do three people's jobs because some rich suit decided a tiny slice of labor cost was worth more than your sanity. These workers are screaming because the company is deliberately short-staffing them to deny them health benefits and enough hours to survive. It’s not an accident; it's a cold, calculated move to keep them poor, tired, and scared. It makes your blood boil because it's the exact same corporate poison we taste every damn day.

And what happens when they fight back? Starbucks fires people, closes stores, and racks up hundreds of unfair labor practice charges. It’s the sound of power trying to crush dignity. The company's goal is simple: destroy this union so every boss in America knows they can get away with this abuse.
We should be furious. We should be standing with them. Because a win for Starbucks Workers United is a thumb in the eye of every boss who thinks they own our time and our effort. It's proof that we can fight back and win the respect we earn with our sweat. This is our fight, this is our anger, and it’s time to call the question: What are YOU going to do about it?

Ordered a cappuccino at my local store and got this… atrocity. No crema, milk overflowed, barely frothed. basically a sad puddle pretending to be coffee. I raised the issue, and they replaced it, but the second one was somehow worse. All I could taste was milk.

At this point, I’m honestly wondering if people here even know what a cappuccino is supposed to be. For a brand that charges premium prices and flaunts “craftsmanship,” the inconsistency and lack of training are wild.",3,1761329097.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

It started with the vast majority of our csuite and senior leadership putting in all of their PTO and for the head of sales to take over the c suite responsibilities in particular. This was apparently a decision from our parent company but what I think spooks me in retrospect is I was asked to cut the recording when they announced this at a company wide meeting at the start of the month (I handle av equipment as part of my responsibilities). 

Then we had this thing happen where all of our projects were accelerated to be before January and I mean aggressively accelerated. Some of these were meant to go into 2027. We were originally told this was because the company is looking to freeze all major changes come January because we expect it to be busy, I now am wondering if this is our managers trying to save us by making us look good.

Finally I found out today all of our budgets have gotten tight to the point where I was told it was effectively frozen. I was also told I would need to take a mindset of ""get the task completed with what's already on hand"". Bare in mind the task at hand was replacing a broken monitor for someone. It's also not just our budget, I was told we couldn't buy scotch tape for the office or coffee for the coffee machines for similar reasons. They also reduced the frequency of office cleanings and are telling people to not ship and are limiting travel for client meetings in other departments. 

I have a nervous disposition so I'm questioning myself here but does this sound like layoffs might be inbound and it's time to start job hunting?",1,1761329086.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

I have no idea what to buy him and his wife isn't very helpful with the situation. We always do some lotto tickets to pad gifts but I'm out of ideas. 

Some things we've bought in the past: heated blankets, those stirring, reheating coffee mug things, crochet scarf, crochet blanket, harley shirts from when we went to california, other coffee and tea related things. 

About him: He's in his 70s and his health is kind of bad (lifelong battle with Crohn's).    
  
He loves harley stuff but I'm not sure he'd really care much for like, ornaments and stuff. He likes the t-shirts and wears one every day. He likes to have the location ones when someone travels there but we haven't been to any this year and don't have any nearby. 

He's always cold, so that's why we've done heated blankets and such in the past. 

He just got his dream car. I believe it's a 1989 Camaro. 

He can't eat a lot of snacks, so food isn't really an option. 

Able to spend up to 100 or so. More for the perfect gift or collection of gifs. 

That's about it. He spends a lot of time resting. Not into reading or any big hobbies or anything other than driving that car too fast. :)

Please help. :) I really want to get him something he'll like, but my anxieties about being an in-law and wanting everyone to like me make my brain freeze up. ",2,1761329068.0,Gifts,1,1.0,False

She called it “platonic friendship,” took some distance, but still checks in on me — I don’t know how to move forward.","I’ve known this girl for about three years. When we first met, she was dating a friend of mine. She had just come out of a toxic relationship, was in a really bad place, and felt completely lost. Shortly after that breakup, she met my friend on a dating app. She said she was only looking for a friend — he wasn’t. They ended up together, moved in after a month, and bought an apartment a year later. Everything happened fast.

From what she told me, their relationship was troubled from the start. They struggled to communicate and understand each other. He was very homebound; they barely did things together apart from the occasional dinner out. I don’t have many memories of them genuinely laughing or looking happy as a couple. They broke up three months ago. I don’t know who initiated it, but she had apparently tried for years to repair things and get him to open up. She had even thought about leaving more than a year earlier. Despite asking him to support her (like encouraging her to do sports and take care of herself), he never really responded. Much later, after they split, I once asked her if she had loved him — and she couldn’t answer. She just said, “That’s a good question, I’ll have to think about it.”

A bit of context: she had serious health problems when she was younger (anorexia, liver issues). Her relationship with her parents is tense and conflictual. Her self-esteem is very low — she doesn’t like her appearance, calls herself “weird” and “not made for people.” She’s very nocturnal, usually goes to bed around 2–4 a.m., and doesn’t have great life habits.

After their breakup, we kept seeing each other. Over time, we became close friends. At first, it was purely platonic, but we talked a lot — deeply and often. She opened up to me about her past, her insecurities, and I did the same. We laughed, shared serious and light moments. It felt easy and natural, like a safe space with no taboos or boundaries.

After several months, I started seeing her differently — less like a friend, more like someone I wanted to build something with. We connected on so many levels, and even though we think differently about certain things, I truly believed we were compatible.

Two months ago, our parents both came to visit us during the same week. I was traveling around with mine, and she asked to join halfway through with her family (she didn’t want to be alone with them and thought it would be easier to travel that way). We ended up spending five full days together — morning to night — talking, laughing, eating, playing games. For me, it was magical.

After that trip, we kept seeing each other once a week or so — walks, drinks, exhibits, sometimes just hanging at her place. We also texted daily — sometimes a quick “goodnight,” sometimes long conversations. I was always the one initiating plans and messages. She’s the passive type; she even admits it.

My messages gradually became softer, more caring, but still within friendly limits. I gave her cute nicknames, sent sweet GIFs and emojis, complimented her a lot, and tried to uplift her when she was down.

After the trip, she went through a really dark period. She was emotionally drained — arguments with her parents, trying to reach out to her ex (telling him the door was still open if he changed, though she said she didn’t expect anything — he never replied), sleeping all the time, no motivation, constant fatigue, emotional exhaustion.

Still, we kept seeing each other — an art exhibit with friends, a nature day trip with my mom. During that period, I gave her a lot of emotional support, which she later thanked me for. I sent her positive words every day to cheer her up. I also became more openly affectionate — heart emojis, hugging GIFs, compliments like “you’re beautiful” or “you’re amazing,” nicknames like “my dear” or “beautiful,” and little encouraging phrases like “I believe in you.”

One night she texted me saying she was crying and feeling terrible. It was the first time she showed that kind of raw vulnerability — she’s usually very guarded, rationalizing her emotions instead of expressing them. After that message, she thanked me for always being there and apologized for being distant sometimes. I decided to show up at her place around 11 p.m., unplanned, just to keep her company.

She looked really down but let me in without hesitation, no awkwardness. We watched a movie and built a little LEGO pumpkin I had brought (she loves Halloween stuff). We didn’t talk about what was wrong — I just wanted her not to be alone. Around 2 a.m., she offered me a mattress in the living room so I could stay. The next day, I left for work, and she thanked me three separate times afterwards for coming that night.

After that, things continued as before — walks, coffee shops, art exhibits. She knew I had something to tell her. During one of our conversations about dating apps and relationships, she noticed I got quiet and distant afterwards. She asked about it several times, saying I could tell her anything. I told her I would, but not right away — I didn’t want to add to her mental load while she was struggling.

After our last walk, she texted me saying, “Okay, time to spit it out — what is it you’ve been holding back?” She insisted, so I told her. I first sent a short message: that she mattered a lot to me and that my feelings had grown beyond friendship. She replied briefly, saying she only saw me as a friend.

The next day we talked about it in more detail over text. I told her honestly how I felt, why, and mentioned all the small signs I thought meant something — but I didn’t go overboard. I didn’t say “I love you” or anything melodramatic. I just spoke from the heart, calmly.

Her response was cold, almost clinical. She said we had a “platonic friendship,” that she liked me as a friend and nothing more. Her tone was detached — no empathy, no real explanation. She said she needed some distance “to process everything.” And that’s what confuses me: if, to her, it’s just friendship, what exactly does she need to “process”?

Over the past few months, there were so many ambiguous signs that I may have misread: long eye contact with smiles, moments of visible shyness, her turning around several times to look back at me when we said goodbye, keeping little symbolic gifts I gave her (a small acorn I found, which she kept in her bag with another good-luck charm; the LEGO pumpkin she placed above her bed; a pretty fall leaf I tucked into her hat that she decided to keep in her purse). We shared drinks and food at restaurants even though she’s normally germ-averse and doesn’t share with anyone.

She never set any boundaries or told me to stop with the cute nicknames — she once said it was “weird but not terrible.” She even admitted she suspected my feelings because another friend and her ex had both pointed out I looked at her differently. She’s very observant; she had clearly noticed my emotional shift months ago. But she never said a word, never pulled away, and kept seeing me one-on-one regularly. That’s what I find odd. Why wait until I confess to suddenly say she’d feel “uncomfortable” seeing me if she thought I wanted to date her?

When I confessed, I also explained my vision of a potential relationship — something slow, light, without pressure, just a natural evolution of what we already had, with a romantic side added in. She replied that it was “interesting,” but didn’t elaborate. I know from our past talks that this type of relationship is exactly what would suit her for now — she’s afraid of intense, suffocating commitment because of her past experiences.

I can’t shake the feeling that her reaction came entirely from her head, not her heart. Her messages were cold, logical, emotionless. She didn’t ask a single question, didn’t try to understand — just shut it down. It feels like a self-defense mechanism, like she’s rationalizing everything to protect herself. Maybe I’m biased, but even my friends who read our messages said her tone didn’t match the depth of our friendship. It didn’t sound like someone addressing a close friend — more like someone putting up a wall.

Here’s the confusing part: despite saying she needed distance, she messaged me yesterday asking how I’ve been, saying she’s “here if I need to talk.” So she doesn’t seem to want to cut me off entirely either.

Right now, I’m stuck between confusion and hope. I still care about her deeply, and part of me can’t help but believe there might be something real underneath all her fears and walls. But maybe I just misread everything. Maybe it was only friendship, and I wanted to see more.

I’m not sure how to move forward from here.

Her words and her actions don’t always align to me — she says we’re only friends, but still checks in and acts caring. I’m trying to make sense of it all: whether it’s emotional confusion on her side, self-protection, or simply friendship with mixed signals that I interpreted differently.

**TL;DR:**  
I \[30M\] confessed my feelings to my friend \[28F\]. She said she only sees me as a friend and needed “space to process,” but she still reaches out and checks on me. I’m torn between giving her distance and keeping light contact, not knowing if I misread everything or if there’s something deeper she’s afraid to admit.",1,1761328737.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1of4m7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ahoge/comments/1of4m7o/here_is_the_perfection_of_life_by_nirvedah/,"here is the perfection of life, by Nirvedah","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761328487.0,ahoge,0,1.0,False

Looking for some travel ideas. I will be going on my honeymoon in March and the first 2 weeks of April so 5 weeks total!

Price isnt really a sticking point (although within reason is preferred).

Weather is also not necessity - we will be coming from Canada so anything somewhat warm is awesome haha, but we are very used to rain/milder climates. But of course, having some sunny days would be lovely but open to any suggestions.

A bit about us - we arent really beach goers. We enjoy the water but we arent really the sit around and do nothing kind of people. We really love immersing ourselves in cities, walking around, museums, architecture, FOOD AND COFFEE!!, just simple things like that.

We have been to Portugal, France, Italy (northern), UK, Germany, Czech, Austria, Netherlands, Mexico and USA.

  
We were thinking about maybe a trip to the South of Spain, and Sicily ?? Perhaps adding in a week in Croatia or a week in Crete as these are also top of our list. Big hubs for us to fly into for decent price are Barcelona, London, Paris, Rome, hence why we were considering Spain/Italy.

We have also considered Fiji/Australia but are a bit concerned about expenses and activities there.

I’ve been doing keto the last week and keep my calories under 1400 and my carbs under 25.  

I looked for Alani’s nutritional and it is sugar free, and 10 calories and 0 carbs but I just freak that it derailing me ? Does anytime else take pre workout and have a worry ? 

I also have multivitamin chewies that say no sugar , and the ingredients verify but I’m working so hard, I worry something is hiding , and it’s messing my journey up ",2,1761328428.0,keto,0,1.0,False

Hi! I'm looking for a roommate to move into my house I own!

The House:  
I have a sun filled bedroom available in my 2bed/1bath house in Kenton. The room is unfurnished and has a large full sized closet and built in bookshelves, it's about 10x12ft. The house is about 840sqt with a full basement and garage, large private backyard and patio, central AC and heating, all updated appliances including an induction stove, and tons of street parking. It’s just a 10-15 minute walk through Kenton park to downtown Kenton, where you’ll find multiple local coffee shops, restaurants, a bike shop, bookstore, and plenty of other great shops. The room is currently painted a salmon color, but was planning to paint back to white.

Rent would be $1000/month plus utilities, which usually end up between $150-$230 depending on time of year (higher in the winter for heat). There is a washer and dryer in the basement, along with storage space if needed. Move in ideally by end of November, but can be flexible on that date.

NO PETS – there’s already a lovely cat and dog.

The Roommate:  
I’m a woman in my late 20s, I work as a graphic designer and am in office Tues-Thurs, and work from home Monday/Friday. I’m fairly active and love to garden, cook, and get outside to ski, climb, and camp. The house is fully furnished, except for the available room. I’m a very tidy person, and the house stays very clean and organized. I also have two pets: Birdie, a 3 year old border collie and Winston, a 4 year old Russian blue cat. They’re both very sweet and friendly, photo included in the listing.

You:  
I’m looking for another woman in her mid 20s-mid 30s, who is responsible, clean, and considerate. I’d love someone who is interested in staying longer term. Also wanting someone who is respectful about cohabitating, being mindful of shared spaces and not partying late.

This is a welcoming and queer friendly household.

I have plenty more photos!

it’s exam season again and i know some of yall are literally running on monster drink, coffee and tears. u probably hv thoughts like “what’s the point”, “ what the heck”, “what am i here for”. 

maybe it’s not just exams, but ur future. like what are u gonna do, what if everything didn’t work out, what if u didn’t do well for ur exams, and from someone tat has went through all of this, i can assure u tat this likely won’t even matter 5 years from now. im not saying this as if i got it all (i dont), but i hope this is what i wished someone could’ve said to me when i was struggling :) 

ik some of yall are genuinely tired. tired of studying, tired of trying, tired of pretending ur fine. and tbh, i’ve been there tooooo. i’ve stared at my notes crying bc no matter how hard i studied, it never felt enough and i gotten soooo frustrated and angry at myself becos nth stayed in my brain. i’ve had nights whr i wondered if disappearing would make it easier for me and others.

but listen, ur life is sooooo much more than grades, careers, or what ppl expect from u. u are not falling behind. yes, u might not receive the results u or ur parents want, but ik that u have put in the effort, and it’s all that matters. we live in a world that keeps demanding more from u than it gives. and u know what? u’ve been surviving every single day. tat’s something rly brave and im proud of you. 

ur future isn’t gonna be ruined by one exam or one “failure.”sometimes the doors that close are just redirections to something u never imagined.

take breaks, breathe, cry if u need to, ask for help, text that friend, talk to a teacher/a counsellor, or anything u had to do. u don’t have to carry everything alone.

and if u’ve been feeling like u don’t wanna be here anymore… please, please stay. the version of u five years from now will thank u for not giving up. i know u can’t see it yet, but there will be moments worth staying for. 

u are loved more than u know. u’re not behind. u’re not hopeless. u’re just human, and that’s enough. 💗

with love,
ur older sis

and, God loves you :)

1of4h5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tyzula/comments/1of4h5b/purpose_of_life_by_nirvasyate/,"purpose of life, by Nirvasyate","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

everything was good until i went to pull into my driveway, but it was blocked by my landlords truck. no big deal, i dont mind parking out front since my two downstairs neighbors need walking aids, so im happy to let them park on my end of the driveway if they need to, but they don't have cars, so im normally the only one that parks there unless the landlord or the neighbors families stop by.

i don't really feel like socializing with my landlord, so i hang out in my car for a min or two and wait for him to leave. I have my window cracked and my door ajar that way i can at least wave to him so he doesn't think im completely ignoring him.

anyways, he pulls out next to my car, i smile and wave, and he immediately starts hounding me about my gfs car (not registered yet because insurance and registration is super expensive in this area), and the replacement tires for it under the porch. he starts yelling that the car is a piece of junk, and that we've brought nothing but junk onto *his property* ever since we moved in 2 years ago. 

(a little context, we moved in here after my partners mom went into the nursing home, and she had been living here for about 10 years prior and was severely disabled, so there has been a ton of mess and clutter for us to clean up since we moved in, and he definitely knows the situation).

i just told him i was sorry, let him know that we are working on getting my gf's ""piece of junk"" registered because she needs it to get to work now that i don't work in the area anymore, and that we'd work on trying to get rid of some of the stuff under the porch (which is just a small moped that fits perfectly underneath it, and a couple tires for her car). he told us we have 1 month to get rid of all that shit or he'd call a towtruck and have my partners new car towed. he won't let us use the empty garage right next to our unit, either.

even the downstairs lady (whos door is right next to our ""junk"") heard the conversation and came to talk to me afterwards, she basically told me that his reaction was total BS and that she didn't even care that there were a couple things next to her door.

it was just really startling because in the 2+ years we've lived here our landlord has always been pretty chill, and i had never had a bad interaction with him prior to him blowing up on me today. our rent is always on time, and we even shorted him $10 a couple months ago, but let him know immediately and he said it was cool, not to worry about it. we gave him an extra 10 on the following months rent just to show him we didn't forget.

i am just very stressed right now and needed a place to vent i am so sorry. i have so much coursework to do for this new job and its so confusing and frustrating especially trying to WFH when my bed is right there, and i just want to sleep off the incoming shutdown. 

all i have to do for work today is sit at my own desk, in my own home, and watch videos about autism all day but i can't even fucking handle doing that anymore i am just so tired of it all.

Sx2

* This might be the best intro theme to a case
* Dramatic, patriotic.  And most of all, intense.

Ax8

* Best opening in terms of hype.
* What an amazing opening. I love the seamless transition from the president's arrival to the ominous shot of the revolver, and then back to the heroic swell of Edgeworth's theme. He's the only man for the job, indeed.
* This song feels like it would play for superman.
* This time, I won't let the haters rank this OST badly.

Bx3

* It's good but not the best there is in this OST

Cx4

# Initial Investigation 2011: B [4.1765]

Sx2

* Such a vibe of an intro song.

Ax4

* Ok, but what does Sakura taste like?

Bx6

* Pretty good investigation opening. Also Lotta solos, sorry Tabby.
* A little to repetitive and tense for an initial investigation

Cx5

* Hey guys, Evil Dr. Boombox here. This one is C for me because while it's compositionally good, I really don't like that attempt at an electric guitar. Boombox out.

# Deduction ~ Crime Scene Truths: B+ [4.4706]

Sx3

* Not as good as Reproducing the Scene

Ax4

* A good, more uneasy theme

Bx8

* S'okay. Definitely fits the vibe.
* I DONT HAVE AN REASONING BUT THIS IMAGE IS FUNNY ASF

Cx2

# Tricks and Analyses: B [4.2353]

Sx2

* We're about to solve a case to this music!

Ax5

* Thinking real harrddd and reallll slowwww with this one
* Knight made a double-kill with the flag and the inflatable

Bx5

* It's not as great as some other trick themes, but it works quite well.

Cx5

* Loud beeping music when trying to logic things out is a choice. It’s not too bad, but drags the music down.

# Mind Chess ~ Opening Moves: A [4.8235]

Sx3

* Fell in love with this right off the bat.

Ax9

* Definitely an intense ""thinking"" song.
* Good music can make or break a gimmick. Here, it helps make the gimmick feel more intense and productive.
* gay chess land
* Top 3 mechanics in the series and a fire ost.
* Bide my time

Bx4

* I like this theme, but I have this weird tendency to forget it as soon as I am no longer playing Mind Chess. And I think it could be a little more suspenseful.

Cx1

# Confrontation ~ Moderato 2011: B+ [4.4118]

Sx3

* One of the absolute best testimony themes no question. Strong and proud, a proper cross-examination. Feels like you are going deep into solving the case - and this is just moderato!
* This, along with 2007, sounds like something that would play in an ice palace.

Ax5

* So cool how they brought Matt Engarde's butler, John Doe, back for this game. I was wondering how he was doing.

Bx6

* I don't love these as much as the first game's, but still a banger.
* It's fine but i like the other ones better
* I hope his wound healed well

Cx2

* Evil Dr. Boombox here again. I still don't like that electric guitar. That's what it's meant to be, right?

Dx1

# Miles Edgeworth ~ Objection! 2011: A [5.0588]

Sx6

* SAXOPHONE BABY!!! (or Guitar Riff, which is also fantastic)
* FAVORITE OBJECTION THEME. NO CONTEST. When that saxophone hits...!!!
* The song is just peak beyond words - the sax section in particular is a highlight.
* Pure sax to the ears.
* I'm gonna rank it as if it were the arranged version

Ax7

* Very good Objection theme. Great use of Great Revival, fits Edgey. Probably better than the previous one.
* I like this better than moderato
* Great Revival (Objection 2.0)

Bx3

Cx1

* I think the way Objection 2009 uses the Great Revival motif is a lot more tasteful. This also sounds like a news station intro.

# The Truth Revealed 2011: A+ [5.2941]

Sx10

* This track gets used in many different situations: new evidence, startlingly revelations, breakdowns. Yet somehow, it always fits. Excellent track.
* Peak
* This theme is the perfect for the suspense moments.
* Potentially the most potent and dramatic truth song out of them all; Fits the culprit's despair excellently.
* Dramatic

Ax2

* One of the most intense Truth themes in the series. Works perfectly for the insane twists this game throws at you.

Bx5

* If they were this dead set on trying to replicate Truth 2009 they should've just reused it. This is good, but it is just Temu Truth 2009.

# Jingle ~ Neverending/Unending Trouble: B [3.9412]

Sx2

* Short and sweet, one of the best in the series
* Feels like a buddy cop soundtrack.

Ax3

* As jingles go, it's pretty great.
* Better than the last one.

Bx4

* Not my favorite jingle, but it's pretty unique.

Cx8

# The Captive/Imprisoned Turnabout: C+ [3.6471]

Sx1

* Um, hi there, John Carpenter? When did they ask you to direct this opening?

Ax3

* Really moody and dramatic in a great way. I just wish it was for a case that's actually as dark and creepy as this theme would imply.
* Legit sounds like horror movie music.

Bx4

* The bells carry the track (though not heard in this link)
* We´re on Halloween, so this theme fits.
* Resident Evil type beat.

Cx7

* AHHHHH MINOR SECONDS MY EARS
* It does its job, I guess
* Black dog
* Fits the moment in the game but isn't really something I'd listen to in my free time

Dx2

# Further Investigation 2011: B+ [4.7059]

Sx4

* actually one of the best investigation themes in the franchise. creates the most indescribable atmosphere i've ever seen in a video game
* This is my favorite of the Investigation themes in this game. It just has that feel of ""let's get down to business and solve this crime.""
* Memories of I2-3 flashbacks plays in my head when this plays.

Ax7

* The theme is great, but less intense that the initial investigation. I blame that track, not this one.
* This is so good. Even I made a lyric in my mind while I've played the investigations.
* Sounds much more serious than 2009.
* Checking the accolades be like

Bx5

Ex1

# Eddie Fender ~ Wisecracking Candor/Joking Motive: A+ [5.5882]

Sx12

* Uncle Eddie brings the bops.
* Outside of a certain culprit, this is my favorite character theme in Investigations 2. So jazzy and fun!
* “Hey, what if we made a character that was close to Edgeworth’s dad, and made him a big character related to his father’s death?” How they pulled it off so well blows my mind, and I really like Eddie. The track being one of the best helps a lot.
* Just a straight up banger, not much else to say.
* Jazzy.
* Such a 80s-90s beat; Goated song for a goated character.
* Bring it on, Milesarino!

Ax3

* This theme goes harder than I remember wtf

Bx2

# Eustace Winner ~ Winning Deductions/First-Class Reasoning: A [4.8235]

Sx5

* This song is so silly it fits him perfectly
* This music is so goofy and innocent - and that's what makes it so perfect for Eustace's character. I'm one of those people who liked him from the get-go, and I think this theme is a big part of the reason why. Sure, he can be annoying pre-character development, but he honestly means well and he's trying his best. This music perfectly embodies that about him.
* WINNING TIME
* Peak dumbass music. Love it
* One of ""Debeste"" tracks.

Ax6

* Goofy ahh theme for a goofy ahh blud
* You hear this theme for the first time, and any threat this character posed just dies. The theme is just okay, but man is it funny.
* He's just a silly little goober
* IT'S WINNING TIME.

Bx4

* It's chill, but fits with the pre-development Sebastian... I mean, Eustace
* It's called the human race because someone has to win it, and that someone is me!

Cx2

* Fits his character, not something I'd choose to listen to

# Confrontation ~ Allegro 2011: A [4.8235]

Sx4

* As I’ve gone back to the other osts, I’ve begun to really appreciate how well the Moderato to Allegro transitions are in each game. This game does it really well too.
* 2nd best allegro in the series

Ax7

Bx5

Cx1

# Verity Gavelle ~ Goddess of Justice/Law: A [5.2353]

Sx7

* Why do I hear boss music?
* ""Haha eustace was so easy to demolish"" \*goddess of law starts playing\* ‘Oh fuck ""
* This might be the character theme with the most amount of aura in the franchise.
* RPG boss battle

Ax7

* Evil Dr. Boombox here. No electric guitars in sight, and the part where it gets all dissonant and like, intentionally weirdly timed? I can't describe it but it's incredible!
* Elegant and imposing, just like Verity Gavelle
* If Eustace removed and tension and threat, Verity and her theme were there to bring it back in full.

Bx3

# Committee for Prosecutorial Excellence ~ Stone Cold Justice/Prosecutorial Investigation Committee ~ Rigorous Justice: A [4.8824]

Sx6

* I love this theme. Perfectly dark and intimidating. Just as Eustace's theme clues you in that he's not a threat, this theme enhances any scene involving Excelsius Winner by underlying that yes, he's acting goofy, but he's still very much a threat.
* One of the best villain themes ever.
* Are we in Ace attorney or Mad Max rn?

Ax5

* Blaise Debeste glares me.
* When you get to my level, you don't discover the truth. You make it, little by little

Bx4

* Imposing and threatening. Perfect for the committee.
* It’s a little too obviously evil, especially past the minute mark. If that part didn’t play until Excelious revealed himself to be evil, I’d like this theme more.

Cx2

# Melancholic/Lamenting Folk: B [4.2353]

Sx1

Ax7

* Very sad. The picture above is extremely fitting.
* This one isn't my favorite ""melancholy"" theme, but I'm ranking it a tier higher than normal because I love the way the game weaponizes it with Simeon before that final reveal. ""You don't trust me anymore? That's awful! I'm sooooo sad!' Yeah, sure you are, buddy.
* Big sad. Good theme tho
* This is the detention center theme of the investigation games.
* Don't be sad, my cute sociopath :(

Bx6

Cx2

Ex1

# Odd/Strange Folk: C+ [3.6471]

Sx1

* 2nd best non-mc ""people/folk"" song behind GAA's supicious folk (Pov: when a Sahwit is lying but you listen anyway)

Ax4

* I feel this game was the start of the series finally getting the “weird people” theme right. Weird, but not annoying to listen to.
* Sorry, but I wouldn't let Florence be my nurse

Bx5

* I enjoy the scatting.
* Frank done seens it again

Cx3

Dx3

Ex1

# Little Thief ~ Secret Weapon of the Noble/The Noble Thief’s Secret Weapon 2011: B+ [4.4118]

Sx4

* A much needed improvement to the previous version of this theme, makes the gimmick much more enjoyable.
* Little Thief dropping bangers twice in a row.
* Better than Crime Scene Truths

Ax2

Bx8

* Banger but you know when this is playing that you're slogging through the most boring shit imaginable.
* This is a downgrade from the first game, ngl. Still good.
* It's fine, but I liked the one from Investigations 1 better.
* A part of this theme remind me about a soundtrack of a Crash Bandicoot level from PS1.
* Better than the last.  That's all.

Cx3

# Heart of the Investigation 2011: B+ [4.5882]

Sx2

* Absolute classic, top 4 core songs.

Ax8

* Evil Dr. Boombox here. That bass is groovin', and the instrumentation here overall is way better than the rest of the OST! It's good stuff!
* This is where shit gets real
* (reading the meme) Hey now, I love both of them equally - oh, right, the music. It's a great ""Heart of the Investigation.""
* Just a great core theme

Bx5

Cx2

# Fifi Laguarde ~ A Hug and Smooch is Entirely de Rigueur/Patricia Roland ~ Hugs and Kisses: B [3.8824]

Sx1

* Genuinely kinda terrifying as a theme ngl. It has a sort of air of authority.

Ax4

* It's not my favorite character theme, but it fits Fifi perfectly.
* Sounds like a song that would be used for ""Mickey Mousing"" in a cartoon.
* I have this song stuck in my head, help

Bx6

* This theme doesn’t give away that she’s evil, while still feeling…large.
* A but the music doesn't really fit with her character so B

Cx4

* It fits. Actually sounds pretty menacing at points.
* Just a part is memorable, the rest is bland.

Dx2

* Musically this is fine but it's just annoying because it really represents a character I just don't like.

# Bodhidharma Kanis ~ The Sound of One's Assassination/Sirhan Dogen ~ Crimes of an Assassin: B+ [4.2941]

Sx4

* ""The Sound of One's Assassination?"" No, that's the sound of PEAK CHARACTER.
* This gave the full aura of this guy and his dog.
* Holy fuck, the atmosphere. Love how solemn it is.
* Freaky.  Just like Kanis.

Ax5

* Fucking menacing. They did with Dogen/Kanis something else than with De Killer and it works great.
* Underrated song for an underrated character.
* I have to give this a good score or else he'll come for me
* After de Killer, this is the second song in the franchise to sound of impending doom.

Bx3

* This has GOT to be racist somehow.
* Kay no
* Long skull

Cx3

Dx1

Ex1

* Fits the character, the music is not for me

# Confrontation ~ Presto 2011: A [5.2353]

Sx8

* They really should add “Presto” themes to the main series. GAA was a good step forward in that regard.
* Peak
* Best confrontation theme EVER!!
* Best testimony song in the franchise.
* Statute of limitations 🔥

Ax5

Bx4

* Doesn't sound as cool and fast-paced as the previous game's.
* good, but it's up against presto 2009. i don't think you can top that

# Pursuit ~ Uncover the Truth: A+ [5.2941]

Sx10

* Ooh, I love this one. It's fast, cool, the break is PEAK. One of the best Pursuit themes.
* one of the two ace attorney songs i'd give an s+, and overall my 2nd favourite track in the franchise behind objection 2017
* Literally one of the best pursuit themes in the series
* This is... the best pursuit theme I heard. Positive vibes is my favorite melody.
* One of my favorites ever, interestingly is not pure adrenaline, but actually has some slow parts which give it a sense of finality.
* Generational; Even better pursuit theme than 2001, a top 5 song in the franchise so far, (This would fit so well in a football/basketball game's climax.) (Even 2009 is elite too, even if I didn't like it winning the OST tournament)
* 2nd best Pursuit theme

Ax3

* Unpopular opinion time: I prefer ""Lying Coldly."" But this is great too!

Bx3

* It’s a good pursuit theme, but doesn’t live up to the previous game. The objection theme might be stronger at points too.

Cx1

* Evil Dr. Boombox again. You just KNOW I hate that electric guitar break. It sounds even worse here than it does anywhere else. I really like the synth lead but overall I find this track very underwhelming among other pursuit themes!

# Pursuit ~ Uncover the Truth (Variation): A [5.1176]

Sx8

* Weirdly quieter than the normal version.

Ax4

* One of the smoothest pursuit transitions.

Bx4

Cx1

* Pursuit 2001 & 2013 are the only pursuit variations to actually change the track substantially beyond the re-intro.

# Turnabout Legacy/The Inherited Turnabout: B+ [4.3529]

Sx1

* Voice acting jump scare

Ax8

* This sounds like a Mario minigame song. Like something out of 64DS or NSMB. Love it.
* Sounds like a catchy TV show, well done
* It's called bake n BOP for a reason
* Such a jolly song for this depressing case.
* Judy's voice is deeper than I thought for a 16-years old

Bx4

* This is fun and sounds right out of an N64 Mario Party. HATE the setting in this case so it's unfortunately associated with that, but it doesn't knock it down too much.

Cx4

# Turnabout Legacy/The Inherited Turnabout Part 2: B [3.7647]

Ax3

* Good little piano ballad.
* I'm not crying! YOU'RE crying!

Bx7

* It's sad and sweet.
* Such a tinge of bittersweet nostalgia befitting of this case.

Cx7

* Too short for a higher rank

# Gregory Edgeworth ~ A Veteran Attorney’s Wisdom/Wisdom of a Defense Attorney: B+ [4.6471]

Sx3

* Man, what a theme. Peak amazing dad energy, makes me want more of Gregory.
* Truly one of the greatest leitmotifs of the franchise.
* Almost as much aura as verity, best character theme in this whole game.

Ax7

* Blue Lantern theme, honestly. Gregory would kill it at the Corp.
* Very calm and collected, just like Greggy himself.
* I love how Gregory's theme is similar to Miles', but still feels entirely like his own.
* Fuck you manfred for killing this guy
* I'm against racial prejudice

Bx5

Cx2

# Samson Tangaroa ~ Candied Happiness/Jeffrey Master ~ Sweet Happiness: B [4.2353]

Sx1

* It's the bake n bop intro but better

Ax7

* So happy and uplifting despite everything. Samson really is a perfect defendant.
* Free Samson, he did nothing wrong.(\*Judy speech bubble\*)
* If I had a nickel for every time the AA series showed canities subita...

Bx4

Cx5

# Restless Folk: B [4.1176]

Sx3

* This is it, y'all. The best People theme in AA. So fun and chippy and happy. Perfectly fits these characters.
* This theme got even more whimsical than the 2001 and 2013 versions.

Ax4

* Quirky! But not annoying, and a charming theme helps a lot
* Really fun to listen to
* Neat and quirky.
* Tooth De-Kay, Greggy Peggleg, Mannykins, Baddie Bumpkin, Moody Judy, Sammypoople, Winniepooh

Bx3

Cx6

* Weakest song in the game. And it's Average. That's the power of AAi2's soundtrack.

Dx1

* Gets a little on my nerves.

# Reminiscences ~ IS-7 Incident: B+ [4.6471]

Sx6

* (incoherent sobbing)
* The case that triggered so many events.
* The pianos at the later half are so peak, probably emblematic of how this event affected EVERYBODY (Just over a baking contest)
* Duncan Seaman and Colin Aries

Ax2

* Very somber and grim. Also kinda sounds like a prelude to the DL6 theme.
* A theme for an incident as important as this one needed a memorable theme, and it delivered

Bx7

* Ugh. I have a remix of this that I really love and think is amazing but I am reminded now that this is... not that. All the remix does is update the instrumentation, and it would get S tier if it were here. I'm just so consistently unsatisfied with the instrumentation in this OST.

Cx1

Dx1

# Tricks and Breakthroughs/Trick Break: B+ [4.6471]

Sx4

* This is a peak logic and truth-like theme, one of the best in the series.
* Thinking really hard rn.

Ax5

* I repeat, the positive vibes of this game are GOAT.
* I asked

Bx6

Cx2

# Judy Bound ~ Candied Dance/Katherine Hall ~ Sweet Dance: A [4.7647]

Sx6

* I love Judy's theme! It's so sweet and happy! If only her story played out as happily as her theme does.
* Bark bark
* The Bake 'n' Bop theme is a masterpiece
* This is somehow even more whimsical than Cammy's song from last game.

Ax4

* I'm just picturing young Eddie dancing to this.
* The sweet other half of Samson
* Spinning girl

Bx4

Cx3

# Carmelo Gusto ~ A Flash of Taste/Dane Gustavia ~ Brandished Flavor: B+ [4.5882]

Sx7

* Yo, what a fucking banger! Orderly and wild at the same time, oozes commitment, passion, pain and ferocity. They struck gold with Gustavia, narratively and technically.
* This theme sounds like aura farming. and it FUCKING WORKS
* Samurai Baker
* Best culprit song in the game.
* ....................................nghg!

Ax4

* Also lowkey sounds like boss music. It definitely fits.
* Good theme for a monster of father and person.

Bx3

* “I wonder who it could be, maybe the person with his own theme?” It playing during is breakdown helps a lot.

Cx1

Ex1

* Obnoxious ass track with awful instrumentation that doesn't even match the shitty fucking character it's meant to evoke.

Fx1

* Fuckin hate this dude

# A Turnabout Forsaken/The Forgotten Turnabout: B [4.0588]

Ax6

* Nah, what's happening on those rooftops😥
* Oh no, Kay died

Bx6

* Good, but needed to be more intense. Feels repetitive with the other intros.

Cx5

* Gee, I wonder if the committee will have something to do with this case?

# Trial of Fate: B+ [4.5882]

Sx5

* BAM!! Great track. Still suffers from the instrumentation like the rest of the game but this shit is GREAT!
* ""Shit just got real""
* This is Core 2011's brother, except even better.

Ax3

* Fate themes need to be both intense and powerful. This one does it in spades.

Bx7

* It's good, but like, it's SUCH a downgrade from AAI1's version.
* Not aa great as the 2009 version

Cx1

Dx1

# Reminiscences ~ The Girl With No/Stolen Memories: A [4.9412]

Sx8

* MY BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY BABY!!! I""LL KILL WHOEVER HURT YOU!!!!!!
* I love when Reminiscence themes take normal songs and make them sad. It actually took me an embarrassingly long time to notice this was Kay's theme though. Still, love this one.
* the initial investigation before the body was found was probably the most unique segment in all of ace attorney, and it wouldn't have reached that status without this masterpiece
* I love the way Kay's theme is turned into something so beautiful and sad. Someone please give her a hug.
* Might be a top ten theme in the series. A beautiful remix of Kay’s theme.
* Reminds me of Terra's theme from Final Fantasy 6. Beautiful. Sorrowful. Longing.

Ax5

* This definitely was inspired by a song from a Final Fantasy game, apparently Cosmo Canyon from FF7  (Also because I didn't get to rank AAI1's OST, Kay's OG song is such a banger.)
* Ngl, I like this Kay

Bx2

Cx1

Fx1

# The Ties that Bind ~ Bonds of Faith and Trust/Bonds ~ A Heart That Believes: A [5.0588]

Sx6

* This might be my favorite DS track in the entire series and it's not even close. It just hits the spot when it plays, be it at Samson Tangaroa's tears of joy, knowing that he'll finally be free, or seeing Kay Faraday remember who she truly is.
* Ugh. I LOVE this track, but I absolutely hate the way it's used in-game. This is THE Investigations 2 emotional pandering track. They blast this shit every 5 seconds when Fender delivers a random ass monologue about how Edgeworth wipes standing up just like his father.
* My heeaaaartttt... Up there with Bitter Taste of Truth in the top 2 best emotional AA music.
* (more incoherent sobbing)
* This theme made me start to tear up. Such an amazing song.
* Should have put up the clown university pic SMH (Also best ""reminiscene"" song by far in this game.)

Ax7

* Emotional.
* Yeah, it's pep talk time

Bx3

* Loved this moment in game, not something I'd listen to often

Cx1

# Turnabout for the Ages/The Grand Turnabout: C+ [3.3529]

Ax2

* Starting off this finale with a trailer of all things.

Bx6

* Yup, it's a Godzilla reference.
* Quite the weak intro for a final case

Cx7

* That part from 0:23-0:27 is in like every intro, jeez

Dx1

Fx1

# Shaun Fenn ~ Bull Headed Teenager/John Marsh ~ Pointed Age: B+ [4.4706]

Sx2

* This boy got that bit-crushed ""Bad boy song"" as if he will ever disobey his mother. (Sounding like a bad-boy biker song from the 70s.)

Ax7

* I was surprised to hear such a rockin' song for this little kid, but it fits him very well. To be fair though, yeah, I never liked his fantranslation name either.
* Surprisingly narsty. I've got a stank face just listening to it.
* M I L K

Bx5

* The child has a more hard theme than any of the adults in this game.

Cx3

# The Legendary Taurusaurus/The Great Monster Moozilla: B [4.2353]

Sx3

* They even cooked on the Godzilla-spinoff movie 🔥
* I'm going deeper underground

Ax6

* Kaiju.

Bx1

Cx6

* It’s fine, Gordy negative-diffs smh

Dx1

* You're not the Godzilla theme, get yo ass out of here.

# Reminiscences ~ The Fall/Downfall of the House of Lang: B+ [4.2941]

Sx5

* Investigations 2 continues to knock it out of the park with ""sad version of a character's theme."" This is so full of resignation over what happened twelve years ago, and yet Lang still keeps pressing on for answers. Because that's what he does.
* This is one of the best reminiscence themes in the series. A mix of Lang’s theme, but subdued with painful memories. Really helps make the case.
* It's like they took the energy out of the original
* Poor Lang.
* Probably the coolest reminiscence song ever, also feels like it would fit in the wild west scenario. (Lang's og song is also so cool too, S as well.)

Ax2

* The wolf alone's theme
* Lonely wolf :(

Bx6

* I love the instruments on this one, and the way it twists the original song's vibe.

# Mind Chess ~ Endgame: A [5.0588]

Sx6

* Only the winners get this theme

Ax7

* This is the part where you say Eustace is a big baby loser.
* Let's go traumatise uh i mean comfort eustace!!
* A bit too fast
* Psychological therapy express! Take that, Athena!

Bx3

* Sometimes, speeding up the song just works

# Eustace Winner ~ Winning Independence/First-Class Farewell: A [4.9412]

Sx8

* I love this song so much. My boy gets his redemption, and this is such a perfect song. It's the same style as his normal theme, but it sounds less silly, and more mature and bittersweet.
* He's not a silly little goober anymore
* The first time I hear a character second/development theme. But this is the reason we need more.
* He's all grown up now.
* Greatest aura boost in the entire franchise.

Ax3

* A young warrior stepping up.
* Thanks for all, Excelsius......and goodbye.

Bx4

* i really wish i got the love for this song
* I'm going to get so much hate for this...but I don't really see why everyone loves this theme so much? It's very good! I love the scene where you hear it for the first time! I love Eustace asserting his independence! I'm just not that into the music itself.
* Feels too serious and formal; I feel like his ""badass"" theme should be relaxed yet confident.

Cx1

* I love that he got his own theme after his character development, but I’m not too fond of the theme itself.

Dx1

* Really does not match Eustace. Not even post arc. This sounds like it's for a cowboy or something.

# Ringtone - Verity Gavelle: B [3.8824]

Sx1

* Verity really had 2 songs to give her as much aura as possible (and this one is for her son TOO)

Ax1

* She having Taurusaurus theme is wholesome if you think about it

Bx10

* I could never have this ringtone wtf. This would scare me away from answering the phone.
* Cute, she really thinks of her son often
* Reminds me of Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening midboss theme.

Cx5

* I think of the ringtone gags this is EASILY the least charming.

# Republic of Zheng Fa ~ The Land of the Phoenix: B [4]

Sx1

Ax6

* Reeks of corruption, like the leader themselves.
* FATSO

Cx2

* Not bad, fits the vibe, but it's a little boring.

Dx1

* Just kinda bland.

# Reminiscences ~ SS-5 Incident: C [3.8235]

Sx2

* I love how the heroic ""Republic of Zheng Fa"" suddenly takes on a sinister tone. It does a great job conveying the simple horror of SS-5.
* It's simple yet haunting, simply haunting.

Ax4

Bx5

* A haunting theme, which is perfect when the point is to focus on the darkest aspects of the case.

Cx4

* I'm sorry, but this song is pretty boring to me. It's a sadder version of an already kinda bland song. It has zero interesting things about it.

# The Puppeteer of/Man Who Masterminds the Game: A+ [5.4706]

Sx10

* If the Joker and John Doe were one…
* The man, the mastermind, the absolute legend! The best culprit in the franchise deserves the best theme, and boy does this deliver!
* Perfect final boss music
* Every final villain need a goat theme.
* Monkey guy turns into Kefka, sort of.
* Don't like this as much as others do, but this is still so fire.
* Society

Ax5

* This is the ""We live in a society"" music. Peak.
* Not just the clown, but the entire circus. A great ace attorney villain benefits a lot with their own theme.

Bx2

* Evil Dr. Boombox here. I'm not a fan of the electric guitar, of course, but I also don't like the accordion. I get the idea, and I'm open to it, but it really doesn't sound good here. I've looked for a bunch of remixes with better instrumentation, but I've actually never seen someone get it to work. Great compositionally, but yet again the instrumentation seals its fate!

# Case Closed! ~ A Brief Calm/Solution! Calm Moment: A [4.8235]

Sx6

* This is the theme I think of when completing a case. The investigation games really do make every ending feel like a major win.
* When the bad people is arrested and the good people is celebrating.
* Probably my 2nd favourite victory song, if not a potential top 1 with AJ's.

Ax5

* ""A Calm Moment"" is a very fitting name for this one. It sounds so soothing and relieving.
* Happi
* And they lived happily ever after

# One Prosecutor's Musings ~ Each Person's Answer/Going Down Our Own Paths: B+ [4.7059]

* God, something about this one. Everything about this scene and song is perfect, but my favorite thing is what it does for Gumshoe. It's a shame he's never come back since this game, but if this is gonna be his last appearance, I'm happy. It was a DAMN good sendoff. He finally got that raise.
* The best song to play after Gumshoe finally got a raise.

Ax7

* I'm getting emotional listening to this. This game is SO good.
* I need a game with Kay and Gumshoe again man….
* We did it boys, salary cutting is no more

* Jesus, those were some loooong credits

# Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit OST: A+ [5.4706]

Sx9

* One of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to in my life. It pushes the DS's soundtrack to its absolute limits. I cannot imagine this OST getting any lower than A+.
* The best game in the franchise has one of the best soundtracks.
* Yeah, this is the best OST so far. While I have issues with some themes (the intros and the pursuit theme), the peaks are too great to ignore. Reminiscences \~ The Girl With No/Stolen Memories is one of the best themes in the series, and everything fits together. First soundtrack I can really say has no major flaws that detract it from top tier.
* Great soundtrack, one of the best overall
* The first game ost was great, but this is excellent. The same position as Trials & Tribulations.
* (To start with AAI1, that one's OST is a great one and probably the most unorthodox soundtrack in the franchise to boot, albeit being one of the slightly weaker OST, highlights are Kay, Badd, Gumshoe, solution, tricks, Yatagarasu, Presto, courtroom and pursuit songs. It got creavitity and style oozing in almost every song, enhancing the game two times over.) For AAI2, this is another contender for best game OST in the franchise with Apollo Justice and the inevitable great Ace attorney soundtracks. Very few songs I would rate less than third from the top tier and there's so many elite songs in this batch that even picking the best out of them almost feels like a struggle. It's going band-for-band with Trials and Tribulations in the best characters themes, improved on Investigations' already fantastic testimonies, and even got the best """"people/folk"""" songs in the franchise as well, enhancing the game's quality at least 3 times over. Greatest highlights include the pursuit song(best song in the game and one of the best in the franchise), Truth (4th best truth song behind AJ, GAA and SOJ, 2nd most despairful truth song too), Bonds-Heart that believe (top 5 Reminiscence songs, so beautiful) (Truth and bonds being top 20 songs so far), Gregory(the best of this next cluster), Fender (These first 5 I mentioned are my top 5 for this game), Verity, Eustace's second theme, strange folk, trial of fate and Objection 2011. All of these are in the top tiers with some more to spare. Iwadare cooked something special with this one, (Even better than the run in SOJ), easily his best OST, for the best game in the series.

A+x3

* It shines brightly, but faintly, because the standouts are few. But it's damn good.
* Only DD and TGAAC beat this

Ax3

* I don't think this OST is quite as phenomenal as some other AA games, but each game stands on it's own and there's absolutely some wonderful songs in here. This game is so intense and fast-moving compared to other games in the series, with some of the most insane twists, big reveals, and dare I say it, hype moments and aura, and I think the OST reflects that pretty well.
* This one is one strong OST, while I'm not the biggest fan of every song, when this soundtrack hits, it HITS.

B+x1

Cx1

* Evil Dr. Boombox here. I've made it clear I don't like the instrumentation in this game on the whole, and that includes not just the electric guitar but also this... uhh... windy, half woodwind half synth sound they always use? I can describe it, which is why I focus on the guitar. Compositionally, I think this OST is good, but I'm sincere in saying that the instrumentation hurts almost every single track.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I can't ignore the fact that Tyler made sure her dead flowers were wrapped in black and white and that the note was also black and white because he knows she has an allergy but Enid drank a coffee with colorful syrups, didn't take her anti-allergic meds and wore bright colored clothing while smiling and dancing to humiliate her in front of the entire school. Tyler only had Wednesday's words to go off of but Enid was told about the allergy by Wednesday's parents and saw Principal Weems back up the claim too but still thought Wednesday was lying about her allergy to maintain her ""tragic, lonely goth girl aesthetic"" 

^(Honestly, I find that description of Wednesday very humiliating, and personally, I would never speak that way about my friends and that too behind their back. But i do like Enid and Wednesday's friendship so I'm willing to overlook it.)

Plus Enid did all of that when she was on good terms with Wednesday and then when she was just a little mad at her.

Tyler did all of that for her while he wanted to _kill_ her.

In s1 the difference is even more stark, he and Xavier are romantically interested in her, so they treat her preferences differently than Enid does. For her birthday, Xavier designed a Gothic cake, and Tyler chose dark chocolate ganache because he wanted to stick to her preferences and boundaries. 

Enid... added a pink balloon to it.

For her gift, Enid made her a snood which did not match her aesthetic at all but she still forced her to wear it while Tyler acknowledged that while the coffee doesn't match her aesthetic he only did it to do something special for her. And on their birthday dinner/date he took her to a crypt, got her favourite flower: a black dahlia, made their cutlery look like weapons, made black and white popcorn buckets, got an old fashioned film projector and tortured her for fun.

Again and again, the contrast in their relationships is shown through how Enid and Tyler treat Wednesday's boundaries. It's not a coincidence. It's meant to show the difference between how the platonic love between Enid and Wednesday translates to Enid pushing Wednesday's boundaries and making her try new things and grow while Tyler gives her space and comfort to be her dark self without any judgement.

The platonic love between Wednesday and Enid equates to loving each other _inspite_ of the things they find weird in each other.

While the romantic love between wyler equates to loving each other _because_ of the things they find weird in each other.",10,1761327791.0,weyler,2,1.0,False

# 1. Define Your Hosting Style

Not all guests are the same—neither are hosts. Some prefer **short weekend stays**, while others enjoy **long-term satys** . Decide what fits your lifestyle best.  
 Short stays offer **flexibility and quick turnover**, while extended stays provide **stability and steady income**.

Platforms like **Llivo** allow you to set your own rules—your **pricing**, your **policies**, and your **services**.  
 Learn more about how Llivo supports flexible hosting in its[ **Guide to Rental Listing**](https://www.llivo.com/p/guide-to-rental-listing).



# 2. Highlight What Makes You Unique

Guests remember hosts who add a **personal touch**. Whether it’s your **location**, your **story**, or your **hospitality**, individuality stands out.

You can make your listing memorable by mentioning **local hidden gems**, offering **airport transfers**, or providing small comforts such as a **coffee corner** or **pet-friendly amenities**.

Remember, guests don’t just book homes—they book **experiences**.  
 Discover tips to create standout listings through Llivo’s[ **Travel Hacks**](https://www.llivo.com/p/travel-hacks).

1of48gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BEFreelance/comments/1of48gb/new_house_what_can_i_do_as_a_freelancer/,New House - What can I do as a freelancer?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently getting my permit to build my first home. I'm a freelancer and I had some questions related to optimizations I can take to purchase things as my BV.

**Context**  
The house I'm building will have 2 rooms that I will use for professional purposes.

1. Upstairs recording room.
2. Part of my BV is giving online trainings, recording videos, ... and for that I want to take it to the next level by transforming an upstears bedroom into a full recording studio
3. Downstairs office
4. In the living room, we'll be adding a half-wall to create an office space whilst also being connected to the living room and kitchen for me to work.

The entirety of the house will be paid by privately. I will use a certain % professionally and for that % I will pay myself rent.

**Questions**  
Of course costs I make for my business, I can pay as my business, but so far those have mainly been costs for things I can physically remove afterwards. What about these costs:  
\- Adding air conditioning to both rooms  
\- Built-in desks, built-in closets, ...  
\- Adding rolling shutters to the windows  
\- ... (Feel free to suggest other things)  
These are all items that I cannot remove or take with me if I ever decide to sell the house. What do you guys recommend from your experience?

What other things should I know to optimize? I'm thinking stuff in the kitchen (Coffee machine?), perhaps the construction of a parking space. I'd love to learn from your experiences.

Lastly, I will be getting a loan from the bank, but perhaps it might be interesting to also loan 50 to 100k from my BV? I'm still in my first 2 years of the BV so I can't yet get VVRP-Bis out before it's built

Thanks in advance!",0,1761327602.0,BEFreelance,6,0.5,False

We were introduced through our families, my mom and sister even suggested I get to know her. 

I sent her a follow on instagram and she followed me back. She asked me who I was since she only accepted because we have common followers(family members). I told her I just wanted to get to know her and if it’s ok with her.

For about a year, we had on-and-off communication on Instagram. I started to kinda like her since we had a lot in common and in certain situations it felt like we were the same person. I asked her twice to go out for a coffee during a timespan of 1 month but she said it was too soon. She always said she was very focused on school (she’s studying medicine and I understand that since my sister is also a doctor and when she was in medical school she didn’t date for years). She is from another city, but has moved to my city to follow her studies. She attends a private school on a scholarship and has to keep her grades at a certain level in order to maintain it.

We met once at a family lunch. We didn’t really talk much there, but the vibe felt really positive. Her family seemed to like me a lot. Three days later, I messaged her saying I had been thinking about her, but she told me she didn’t see me the same way anymore. I found out her family told her I was a great guy and she should’ve given me a chance. Her mother said her daughter didn’t really think too much about that reply (she told the mother herself).
She advised her daughter to think about it because she thought I was a great guy.

After some time, she deactivated her Instagram. Meanwhile, I went out with other girls, but honestly, none of them clicked. When she reactivated her account after a few months, I reached out, told her I was thinking about her, and she asked why. I said I didn’t really know, just felt like she’s the one I want to be with. She said she liked my courage, but was afraid that getting to know someone would distract her from her studies. She didn’t want me to accuse her in the future for a lack of commitment. I told her to at least meet for a coffee first and then we will see about what we will fight for in the future.

We agreed to meet for a coffee. The coffee went well, vibes were warm and positive. Afterward, I asked if she wanted to meet again, and she said “ok.” A few hours later, I messaged saying I had a good time; she replied that she did too. I joked that it took me a year to go out with her, but it was worth it. She replied that she wasn’t sure yet, but we will see.

Since then, I’ve messaged her three times, and she’s left me on delivered every time.

I would’ve appreciated it more if she would just tell me she isn’t interested instead and of just acting like this.

1of45on,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1of45on/chemex_filter_height/,Chemex filter height?,"Hi everyone,  
  
I’m fairly new to understanding coffee and the science behind why things work the way they do, so apologies if this is a basic question! I’ve been researching Chemex and pour over methods, and I haven’t found much discussion on this topic (please point me to any existing threads if I missed them). From watching Chemex tutorials and other pour over videos, it seems a general rule is that the closer your kettle spout is to the coffee bed, the better assuming you’re pouring with controlled precision. With that in mind, I’ve noticed that traditional Chemex filters sit quite high above the rim of the Chemex itself.

If the goal is to have the spout as close as possible to the coffee bed for a precise pour, why aren’t Chemex filters designed to sit lower, closer to the rim? This would allow the kettle spout and therefore water to be positioned exactly where you want it, leading to a more controlled and precise pour.

I understand the need for an open air channel between the spout and the filter, but it seems odd that there’s so much extra filter material extending above the rim, which make pouring more challenging.

1of45hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1of45hm/villainess_of_tangled_tragedies_vtt_chapter_1/,Villainess of Tangled Tragedies (VTT) - Chapter 1,"**Chapter 1: “Out of Ten”**

The review window blinked.

>*“One out of ten. Too happy, too clean. Where’s the ruin? Where’s the misery? Stories without actual challenge aren’t stories at all.*

>*This started well enough. With Jacob being weak, struggling to survive in a broken system, that had potential. But the moment he got the leveling ability, the tension collapsed. Every fight after that was predictable: grind, new skill, instant win. Watching him bulldoze through dungeons stopped being exciting after the third repeat.*

>*The supporting cast may as well not exist. His guild ‘allies’ and family vanish into the background whenever the plot doesn’t need them. Relationships are teased but never developed. Everyone exists to admire Jacob, and it’s tiring.*

>*The villains are no better. They seemingly enter with “threat,” only to be flattened within a chapter. There’s no lasting consequence and emotional weight. It’s all sparkles and fairytales without substance. It’s shallow comfort dressed as “struggle,” and that’s why it fails.”*

She pressed submit without hesitation, lips quirking as the score registered. 

**—“Happy endings are the best. Don’t ruin it.”**

**—“What is this reviewer even talking about?”**

**—“Did you actually read the book?”**

**—“Why are you such a hater?”**

Soon, the thread lit up. No doubt, angry fans defending their precious sugar-spun ending, insisting that happiness was what readers needed. She disagreed. Happiness was cheap; tragedy was real. 

She wasn’t cruel, not really: she didn’t want suffering for its own sake. She had simply never tasted it herself, and so it fascinated her. The heartbreaks, the betrayals, the inevitable collapse of fragile dreams… these were the marks of lives lived honestly. 

Watching characters stumble and break was the only time a story felt true.

Her own life was a straight path with no bumps. Born with a diamond spoon in her mouth, her parents’ names were behind every door before she even reached for the handle. Her university years were a mix of parties and luxury trips branded as “student retreats.” Even professors lowered their standards at the first glimpse of her surname on the roll.

After graduation, finding work wasn’t a struggle. 

One of her parents’ companies brought her in, immediately placing her in a high-level management position that most people her age could only dream of. The job was really less about her impeccable skills and more about her family name, but she never questioned the arrangement.

Her days in the office were predictable: meetings began when she stepped through the door and ended the moment she closed her notebook.

“Rewrite this,” she would say, sliding a folder across her polished desk without opening it. “Make it perfect. I expect it this evening.”

She would even snap her fingers at her secretaries while walking past. “Coffee. Use that new brand from Cali. And put in a call to accounting; I want their quarterly numbers before lunch.”

Any mistake was corrected with two words: “Fix it.” She never bothered with explanations. 

She handled romantic relationships pretty much the same way. She’d had boyfriends during university and after, but none lasted more than a year. They often described her as demanding, someone who needed attention and comfort without offering much in return. 

She did not see it that way, but she noticed how quickly the men around her lost their patience.

Matchmaking for a good marriage came next, arranged through her parents’ social circles. They paired her with sons of executives, heirs of old families, and even a few politicians’ nephews, all presented as suitable partners. Each match began with promise, filled with polite dinners and family introductions, but they ended just as quickly. 

She was too particular, and they were too ordinary.

Over time, she stopped expecting much from relationships. They had become another form of leisure, another way to fill the calendar rather than a step toward anything meaningful. 

Yet, even with her job and her social life, she found herself facing something she had never expected: emptiness. Each and every milestone that others celebrated felt unremarkable to her. Promotions were meaningless when they were guaranteed, and relationships faded without leaving any memory worth keeping.

To distract herself, she searched for new hobbies. 

For a while, she found herself drawn to gacha games, lured by the promise of rare rewards and colorful characters. She spent far too much money rolling for digital figures, the rush of chance filling her evenings. 

It was exciting in the moment, but the thrill disappeared as quickly as it came. After all, all she needed to do was pour more money into it to solve the problem.

In that boredom, she found something else: webnovels.

At first, they were nothing more than another distraction, something to skim while lying in bed after work. But soon, she realized they offered more than she had expected. Unlike the polished books on bookstore shelves, webnovels had *no filter*. They came from anyone willing to write, whether or not they could, and within them, she found ideas far stranger and more human than what she was used to reading.

There were hidden gems buried under the endless lists of titles. She discovered obscure stories where authors dared to write about grief, betrayal, and ruin without softening the blow. These works struck her as more authentic than the carefully crafted happy endings she’d grown to dislike. 

There, in those raw, unpolished chapters, she found something closer to the tragedy she had always wanted to see.

For a time, her hobby filled the void. She spent late nights following obscure series, leaving comments, and even joining communities where readers discussed their favorite works. 

The unpredictability of webnovels gave her a sense of discovery, a feeling she rarely experienced in her own life.

But trends, as always, began to shift. More and more authors abandoned unique ideas in favor of what sold best. Romance-driven fantasies, shallow action stories, and formulaic plots increasingly filled the updates page. 

Writers who had once dared experiment now wrote only what they thought would earn them views and income.

They disgusted her. 

The very medium that had once offered her something real was being eroded by the same forces that shaped every other industry. Uniqueness was traded away for popularity, and her beloved tragedy was softened for what the public favored.

To her, it was all just another reminder that happiness was cheap, and the pursuit of it ruined everything.

Her frustration soon gave rise to a new habit: whenever a story fell into predictable patterns, she gave it the lowest rating she could, and left behind a sharp review. It wasn’t enough to simply drop the novel; she wanted the author to *know* why their work was unworthy. The more she read, the more mediocrity she recognized. 

Each time she saw another cliche trotted out as though it were fresh, her patience thinned until her only outlet was criticism.

She lashed out often, leaving one-star reviews that cut straight to the point. To some readers, she was a menace, an anonymous figure who crushed rising stories with blunt dismissal. To the authors, she was worse. 

Many reported her behavior, flooding the moderators with complaints and demanding her account be suspended.

But nothing came of it. After all, her parents owned the very platform where these writers published. She had complete and utter freedom to say whatever she pleased.

Even so, she didn’t abandon her respect for the act of writing itself. She never dropped a story partway through, not even the ones she despised. If she was going to rate it poorly, she made certain she read it to the final chapter. In her mind, only those who endured the entire work had the right to condemn it.

Sometimes her reviews stretched to paragraphs, line-by-line explanations of where the author had failed. She broke down tropes, listed cliches in order, and mocked cheap twists that had been done a thousand times before. 

In the comments, she accused them of chasing easy dopamine hits, pandering to readers who wanted comfort instead of depth.

To her, their kind of writing was cowardice. It avoided the raw honesty of stories and replaced it with artificial highs that never lasted. 

But her life changed one evening.

She left the office with her phone in hand, sliding into the driver’s seat of her imported sedan. The engine roared to life, and the car rolled forward.

Her phone *dinged* with a notification. She normally kept her phone on silent, so it was a curiosity as to why her phone made a sound. Her eyes were fixed on the screen as she tapped it open, revealing an email message.

***—Congratulations, you’ve been chosen.***

She barely noticed the vehicle speeding through the intersection from the side. 

***BANG!***

The crash came with a violent crunch of metal, her body slamming against the airbags as glass shattered around her.

Pain tore through her chest and air fled her lungs. The phone flew out of her hand, its bright screen smashing against the floor. 

She tasted blood, heard voices shouting outside, and felt the heat of something leaking in the air.

*‘W-what happened?’* She tried to make sense of things, but her thoughts were in disarray. 

She tried to lift her arm, but it refused to move. 

Soon, she could hear screams and people shouting. “Hey! There’s a car accident here! Call an ambulance!”

‘*Ah… I must look ugly bleeding out right now…’* Those were her last thoughts, before darkness swallowed her.

# . . . . .

The story she’d picked up that day had been a tower-climbing fantasy epic that was at the top of the site’s rankings.

Its premise was simple. A massive tower had appeared in the middle of the continent, its one hundred floors rising into the clouds. The world had changed upon its arrival, for the tower declared a trial: clear the tower within ten years, or the world would be destroyed. 

Of course, the main character just happened to be the most generic man alive.

How generic? His name was Arthur.

Arthur was introduced to the story as a commoner born into hardship, but he conveniently possessed every hidden advantage possible. He was handsome but modest, strong but humble, and his destiny was spelled out from the very first chapter.

The tower itself was a carnival of clichés. Every floor represented a different trial: goblin caves, lava mountains, deserts, frozen wastelands. Each challenge was described as impossible, but Arthur always overcame them with either sudden bursts of strength or convenient items appearing at the last moment. Wherever there was a locked door, a key would fall into his lap. Wherever there was a deadly trap, his god-given instincts would miraculously flare for the first time, saving him. 

Readers were expected to applaud each “narrow escape.” 

Outside the tower, Arthur lived in the university city that had sprung up around its base. Ostensibly set in a world of medieval fantasy, the city looked suspiciously like every standard academy setting: professors lectured on ‘mana theory’ and survival tactics for climbing the tower; noble heirs strutted about like peacocks; and Arthur, still technically a poor commoner, somehow always ended up being the center of attention.

He gained a harem, of course. By the end of the fifth arc, no fewer than four women had attached themselves to him, including a fiery redheaded swordswoman, a shy healer with silver hair, a noble princess who saw “something special” in him, and an elven archer who inexplicably abandoned her sworn duties to join his climb. 

Each one fell for Arthur without resistance, their personalities reduced to one-note traits meant to orbit his greatness.

The tower’s deadline hung over the world, but hardly mattered. Every arc promised impending disaster, then undercut itself the moment Arthur stumbled into another miracle. 

By the halfway mark, the plot stopped pretending to be anything other than it was. Arthur was the *chosen one*, the only one who could save the world; the story bent over backwards to make him untouchable.

“What the fuck?!” She had finished the latest chapter with mounting disgust. She’d wanted to throw her phone out the window. It was the first time she felt compelled to not just drop a book, but to attack it outright. 

Her review had been merciless. 

She called the story a joke, Arthur a cardboard cutout with plot armor thicker than a layered brick wall, and the harem a fantasy written by someone who had never spoken to a real woman. 

She highlighted every lucky break, every contrived twist, and every trope paraded as “originality.”

Readers had defended it, of course. Fans insisted Arthur was “inspiring” and the harem “romantic.” But to her, it was everything wrong with stories, merely junk food passed off as art.

Unfortunately for the wealthy heiress, upon the moment of her death, she’d found herself transmigrated into the very same story she so despised.

# . . . . .

The first morning had been chaos. She had woken beneath a canopy of silks, sweating from a fever, her limbs trembling, and the next moment, worried voices surrounded her bed. 

Her parents had nearly torn the room apart in their panic, shouting for the doctor, saying that their daughter had woken up. The man had arrived promptly, examined her pulse, and checked her temperature before finally declaring it was nothing more than a passing illness.

Still, her parents had not calmed.

“Celstia, my darling, are you certain you feel well enough to be up?” her mother asked now, hovering near her bed. “You gave us such a fright when you collapsed. I’ve already told the doctors to prepare more medicine, just in case.”

“She still looks pale,” her father agreed immediately, though his gaze softened the moment he looked at her. “Perhaps you should rest a little longer, hmm? No need to strain yourself.”

Her mother still feared, holding her hands. “We can have the doctor return tomorrow. I will not take any chances.”

They hovered like this constantly, careful as though she might crumble at the slightest touch. At first, worry hovered in her mind. What if the parents of this body realized their daughter had changed? What if her mannerisms slipped, if she said something out of place? 

But her worries were unfounded; her new parents were doting to the point of blindness. They offered her gifts without being asked, hovered over her health, and reassured her at every turn. 

Far from suspicion, they seemed eager to indulge her every whim.

Once she fully recovered after a few days, she had a clear idea of where she was now.

Lifting the porcelain cup to her lips and sipping carefully, she let the warm tea spread across her tongue. The manor’s drawing room was quiet except for the faint rustle of servants moving in the hall; she found the calm almost amusing. 

Only a few days had passed since she’d opened her eyes in her new body, but already the household bent to her whims.

Within the manor’s library, she found records of the tower’s appearance five years ago. It seemed coincidental at first, but upon further reading, too many things lined up perfectly. 

She was inside the novel she had once ridiculed: *Tower of the End.* That angered her, but was there really anything she could do about it?

“Make-up,” she said after she finished tea-time, her voice carrying across the room.

“Yes, My Lady,” her personal maid replied immediately, bowing her head before fetching the box of powders and brushes.

She sat into the cushioned chair before the large mirror in front of her, framed in carved silver, its surface clear enough to reflect every detail. She studied her face the way an artist would examine a canvas.

Platinum-blonde hair spilled down her back. Her chin was sharp, her lips pale, and she had sharp eyes that seemed to intimidate anyone she glared at. But most importantly, she saw her noble family’s most famous trait, enchanting red pupils.

She lifted her chin slightly, admiring the sculpted body and face in the mirror. 

Her place in the story had become clear after a few days of careful recollection. In the *Tower of the End*, she was a minor villainess, a stepping stone to highlight Arthur’s so-called chivalry.

Her name in this body was Celestia von Reingarde. Generic, almost painfully so. 

In the webnovel, Celestia’s role had been comically pitiful. She was remembered for petty cruelty; she bullied one of the female heroines, a shy commoner girl with a talent for healing magic. Arthur, ever the gentleman, intervened at the perfect moment, scolded Celestia in public, and gained the healer’s admiration. That single scene was the spark that set off their entire romance subplot.

Celestia, meanwhile, after a few more scenes to highlight the newfound connection between Arthur and the silver-haired healer, slowly faded into irrelevance. A villainess of convenience, used once and discarded.

Still having her make-up done now, she tapped one finger against the polished armrest. *‘If that’s the case, then I don’t really have to do anything, right?’* she thought to herself. 

*‘Let Arthur climb the damn tower and save the world. I’ll just stay out of the way, enroll at some other school, live quietly, and watch this circus from a distance.’*

The idea soothed her. Why force herself into the mess of Arthur’s miracles and harems? The plot could move on without her interference. 

She had no desire to stand in the spotlight if it meant being trampled by clichés.

But just as she leaned back, a sound like static crackled in her mind. A sharp, artificial voice blared as though spoken directly into her skull.

I was maybe 13 or 14 back then, and I was hella weird when I tried to engage in a conversation with her. The details don't matter, but I was THE weirdon in her eyes. My friend knew I liked her, she knew I liked her, and she told him to let me know that she didn't like me, found me weird, and wanted me out of her life, which broke me, but that's teenage romance and stuff so I brushed it off.
(me and that friend are no longer in contact, and he really doesn't wanna regain contact with me for reasons I won't mention)

Fast-forward 4 or 5 years, I'm an adult now, and I have a job (we live in a small town, there's like 2 or 3 big companies that are employeeing most of the residents in our city).
I haven't seen her or thought of her in those years, but the longing for her remained.And coincidentally, I see her a few days ago while at work, she's new because she's wearing a west the company requires new operators to wear.

How do I approach her? I know she used to despise me, but I can't read her mind and know whether she might have  changed her opinion about me by now or not. it was so long since we last met face to face, but I really want to at least go for a coffee with her.
any advice from more experienced people in a complicated situation such as the one that I'm in?

I’m from our very own chaos-filled city — taking things slow after a recent breakup and thought I’d try my luck here again.

I’ve been in two relationships before — both good people, but sometimes things just don’t work out. No drama, just lessons learned and some gratitude along the way 🙂

Now I’m at that point where I’d love to meet someone I can genuinely vibe with — someone real, kind, and fun to talk to. Nothing heavy, just good energy and easy conversations 💫

I’m into anime, movies, street food runs, and those long random chats that somehow stretch till 2 AM 🌙. Expect meme exchanges, sudden Harry Potter quotes, and overthinking Marvel endings 🎬😂

So, fellow Delhi folks — any advice on how people actually meet someone genuine in this city? Or if you’re reading this and feel the same way, maybe we can start with a coffee or a walk somewhere that isn’t jam-packed for once ☕🙂",1,1761327159.0,delhi,4,1.0,False

Doesn't have many friends, lives alone. She is however still close with my wife and her other two daughters. She is kind and polite, but has some behaviors that to me are simply exhausting. I'm starting to be more concerned about this now too because we have twins on the way in March 2026. 

Basically, she at some point decided to become a hardcore Catholic. She is very on top of various Marian apparitions and accompanying warnings. A year or two ago she was on a ""Three Days of Darkness"" kick, where apparently the world is going to end and bad things are going to happen for three days and lights/electricity won't work at all. The only light can come from blessed beeswax candles. She went and got tons of beeswax candles and gave us some. She also is a devotee of this women in Ohio (Holy Love Ministries) who I guess talks with the Virgin Mary and relays her messages. Btw this was officially condemned by the Catholic Church. But she got us a book copy of the top messages. Then  a few months later she got us another copy of the same book. Either she forgot she already did this or wanted us each to have our own. I don't know. 

Last week she came over to drop something off and also left a copy of this book, ""The First and Last Deception: Aliens, UFOs, AI, and the Return of Eden's Demise."" Basically it's a conspiracy laden account of how everything in the modern world is the work of the devil. Then a few days later she came over Saturday morning to have a talk with us, wouldn't say what about. Then she shows up and starts saying that she thinks my stepson's biological father secretly gave my stepson the Covid boosters and now he has myocarditis or something. She went on about this for like 30 minutes. It was just a fall Saturday and we were drinking coffee.

I've told my wife we need some boundaries here. I really try to be nice, but I just can't entertain every insane thought that enters her head. I don't want her filling my twin's minds with idiotic conspiracies. My wife says you have to just let her say what she thinks and then she'll be done. But clearly this isn't true. It just means she thinks she has a receptive audience for her wack job theories. It makes me just not want to spend time with her family.

Anyway I am not sure if anyone can relate or has any advice. Even if just an expression of solidary, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",4,1761327133.0,inlaws,1,1.0,False

# Best Places to Visit in Edinburgh: Must-See Edinburgh Attractions

**What to see in Edinburgh starts with the obvious—and they're obvious for good reason.** Edinburgh Castle dominates the skyline. The Royal Mile connects centuries of history in one cobbled street. Arthur's Seat offers volcano hikes in the city center.

**Edinburgh tourist attractions rank among Europe's best** because they deliver authentic historical experiences, not theme park replicas. You're walking streets that Mary Queen of Scots walked, climbing towers that defended against English armies, and exploring underground vaults where real people lived and died.

# Best things to do in Edinburgh Scotland

**The essential Edinburgh landmarks:**

**Edinburgh Castle** tops every list. This 12th-century fortress houses Scotland's Crown Jewels, the Stone of Destiny, and the National War Museum. Book timed entry tickets online—the castle sells out, especially mornings. Budget 2-3 hours minimum to explore the Great Hall, St Margaret's Chapel, and panoramic viewpoints.

**The Royal Mile** connects castle to palace across one ""Scots mile"" (1.81km) of medieval magnificence. This isn't just a tourist street—it's living history with 17th-century tenement buildings, hidden closes (narrow alleyways), and landmarks like St Giles' Cathedral. Pop down closes to discover courtyards frozen in time.

**Palace of Holyroodhouse** serves as the King's official Scottish residence. Tour the State Apartments where monarchs still entertain, see Mary Queen of Scots' chambers, and explore the ruins of Holyrood Abbey in the gardens.

**Arthur's Seat** proves Edinburgh sightseeing isn't confined to buildings. Climb this 251-meter extinct volcano for 360-degree views. The one-hour hike rewards you with perspectives across the city, the Firth of Forth, and on clear days, all the way to the Scottish Highlands.

**Calton Hill** offers easier elevation gain (just 5 minutes to the top) with equally stunning views. The hilltop monuments—National Monument, Nelson Monument, Dugald Stewart Monument—create Edinburgh's ""Athens of the North"" nickname.

**Victoria Street's** colorful curve down from the Royal Mile to Grassmarket is Instagram-famous for good reason. Said to inspire Harry Potter's Diagon Alley, it's lined with independent boutiques and atmospheric cafés.

**Greyfriars Kirkyard** combines Edinburgh sightseeing with literary pilgrimage. Beyond the famous Greyfriars Bobby statue (the loyal terrier who guarded his owner's grave for 14 years), you'll find tombstones that inspired Harry Potter character names—Tom Riddle, McGonagall, and Moodie.

**The bottom line:** These Edinburgh landmarks form your foundation. See them first, then branch into neighborhoods, museums, and hidden gems. Book castle and palace tickets ahead, wear comfortable shoes for cobblestones, and remember—Edinburgh reveals itself slowly. Rush nothing.

1of40p8,https://i.redd.it/3qb8f52sh3xf1.jpeg,Solved (I hope)!,"I finally got my copper numbers back up after almost 2 years of trying. I can’t say exactly what worked for me but the winning combination included:
-Taking a digestive enzyme 2x a day
-Taking antibiotics to treat SIBO (asymptomatic)
-Cutting back on coffee, increasing fiber
-Cutting out raw oats in my morning smoothie
-Supplementing 4 mg of copper glycinate and a few capsules of beef liver

My symptoms were neurological. I had tingling and a cool sensation in my feet. I had minor muscle spasms all over my body but especially in my legs. I noticed tightness in my legs at the end of the day, especially around the sciatic area in my calves. It never got to the point where it limited my walking, but it did slightly affect my gait. I could not run.

I supplemented on and off for much of the time my numbers were low. In some cases, my numbers actually got worse with supplementing and I ended up with a zinc deficiency for my troubles. Both zinc and copper are normal again now.

I noticed the leg sensations, especially the spasms, were getting less noticeable recently but I didn’t want to be too optimistic without seeing my blood results. Sure enough, my numbers were improved.

I plan to keep doing the enzymes and 2 mg of copper but I’m optimistic this is solved. Hope this helps someone out there!",2,1761327106.0,Copper_deficiency,4,1.0,False

It's a wealthy and successful crowd of mostly folks in their late 20s-late 40s. Think the typical SMU Cox B-school grad as a representative sample. I couldn't help but notice that of the 20 or so women there (aside from being thin, very well dressed, and carrying a Chanel bag), all seemed to have long thick shiny blonde hair. Every single one. We do have a beer named ""Dallas Blonde""....maybe there is a reason for that.

My wife was chatting with them during cocktail hour and she came back and was like ""see her? Hair extensions"". See her over there? Extensions AND a topper. Look at how tall that hair is. Blondes don't have thick hair like that; it's always finer. No way it's real"". 

Then we start looking into extensions and other products that give the illusion of more natural hair. Easily $5k/year, not including highlights. We're probably talking $10k/year just for hair, all in. Not to mention filler, botox at a minimum that is seeminly a requirement. And we are talking for women that aren't even 30 from the looks of it.

What the heck is going on around here? I know there is $ in Dallas, but we were in Santa Barbara (most expensive place in the country for the most part) for vacation and I didn't see any of that.

“Jeju can we go see Mummy?” Jack asked.  
There was a sudden silence as they all looked at the young boy.  
“M-Mummy?” Kara asked.  
Astra looked both very amused then somewhat horrified.  
“Jack it’s probably best we don’t do that,” Astra said quickly. “She doesn’t know who we are.”  
Jack looked at Astra sadly the edge of a pout showing.  
“But I wanna hug past Mummy and tell her I love her. She said she was sad until she had us and I wanna make her happy.”

Kara is fighting a new alien that's more than she bargained for. When the alien gets the better of her, she awakens in an unfamiliar room. When Lena comes striding in, Kara's life ceases to make sense.

Kara time travels 5 years into the future and discovers what's in store for her. SuperCorp. Mentions of Sanvers. A happy little storyline that would not stop plaguing me until I wrote it. Looks like I'll be working on this story and my other story, 'Should’ve used a Condom' simultaneously for a while. This one will end up shorter than that one.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

If you’re a founder, CEO, or someone building something of your own, I’d genuinely love to meet you, learn from your experiences, and understand your mindset. I’m not looking for favors — just real conversations, insights, and maybe some guidance from people who’ve been where I want to go.

I believe Bangalore has the energy, people, and opportunities that can shape my journey — and I’d love to make the most of it. If you’re open to meeting for a quick coffee or chat, I’d really appreciate it. 🙌

Maybe that’s not entirely true, but it feels true enough. I’ve never drawn a picture and hung it on a wall. Never tried to write a song. Never written anything that wasn’t for school or work. In high school, I barely passed English—my mother still remembers the 48% I brought home on my grade ten midterm. (For the record, that was more due to effort and attitude than aptitude.)

And yet, here I am. Forty years old, having decided that I’m going to write a book.
I have a plot in mind. A backstory, even. I’ve been reading blogs about story structure, self-publishing, editing—everything except the one thing I’m actually supposed to do: write something down.

So this is where it begins. With hesitation, probably too much coffee, and the quiet suspicion that I might be out of my depth.

Join me as I trip, fall, and get back up again—trying to write a story that, with any luck, someone who isn’t related to me will want to read.

What really changed my mornings was not discipline but direction. I quit trying to live like a monk and began asking, “What’s one thing today I actually care about doing?” When you have a reason, you don’t need an alarm. When you don’t, no amount of routine can help you.

My “morning routine” has become coffee, silence, and one meaningful task. That’s all. Sometimes I write. Sometimes I just sit. But every time I feel lively not just “optimally”.

Because nobody went through life-changing experiences because they decided to wake up at 5 AM. It was their struggle to realize the reason behind the change that made the difference.

Basically in the same life situation, single, living in a rented place, etc. However, he keeps complaining about money, like the rent is enormous (we pay basically the same, maybe 50eur difference), the gas is so expensive, the coffee is expensive. This is just to paint a picture - we make the same, our expenses are similar (maybe his are even smaller)

And then, he always comes up with some kind of excuse of not paying for coffee (its customary to do rounds here, you pay the whole tab once, then somebody picks up the tab next time etc), ranging up to a ""could you get this, you know I am in a pinch""

I decided to bring this up with him, asking if he had some debts or expenses I didn't know about and why he never picks up the damn tab and he got awfully mad and hasn't spoken to me in days.

From the historic city of Jodhpur (Rajasthan, India), I embarked on my tech journey with the aim of building meaningful software solutions and learning deeply across both frontend and backend landscapes. My core focus areas are Java-backend development (Servlets, JDBC, Hibernate, Spring Framework) and full-stack web applications (React, Node, Python/Flask).

Over time I’ve built real-world projects, constantly moving forward. I’ve worked with custom annotations, file-based logging and advanced concepts in Spring (without relying solely on Spring Boot). At the same time I’m beginning to bring in AI/ML knowledge to shape smarter applications.

My schedule is rigorous: I devote many hours every day to mastering new skills, building projects and sharpening my problem-solving ability. In parallel, I’m gearing up for competitive programming, DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) and bug-bounty exploration, so I stay sharp both in system design and in security-aware coding practices.

I believe that code is more than syntax—it’s a tool for innovation, building value, empowering others and solving real problems. I enjoy sharing what I learn: on my blog, via my YouTube channel (StackHunt by Lilawat) and on social platforms.

Just wanted to share a story with you all javing a same pation. 
Before this, i had gone through quite a few fast. Usually between 24h up to 3 days. I tried and failed 5 days goal multiple times, always hitting a wall with headache, dizziness and or hunger cravings.

Im 43M, 90kg/198p, 176cm/5,9’ when i started fast. I have quite active live stile, for two decades im in the gym almost every morning , its my go to place not only for physical benefits, but also/mainly mental clean up. But because of mu recent health problems i broke my routine , let go with my diet and gained a lot of weight (my regular is 78kg/165p.) i have a lot of muscle comparing to “regular population.

Last Sunday i looked into the mirror with “horror” and said to myself , thats it and started fast with initial goal 3days.  

3days goal become 5, than it become 7. And here we are 12 days later I keep going feeling great. I already lost 8kg/18p. 

My goal now is 14days, not sure if I should continue further though, did not this kind of fast before. Im slowly preparing to start eating slowly and carefully. 

My supplements are :

Half spoon of salt morning and evening 
Magnesium
Potassium 
Calcium
Zinc
Vitamin D and C 

Water , tea and very occasionally black coffee.

I’m a barista and love coffee. He has many health issues when it comes to foods, and coffee is one of the million things he reacts to (gets eczema, sore throat…) 

Coffee is also one of the most addictive things he’s ever abused. He says out of all drugs in the world, coffee is the most addictive for him (he doesn’t do drugs but tried stuff when he was younger, he is crazy into healthy lifestyle these days). You can see the issue here.

Now - he wants the house to be completely coffee free, so he doesn’t get triggered. Me, I obviously would love to enjoy a morning coffee at home on the weekends. But I get where he’s coming from, so I won’t do that, cause that would imo be an asshole move. The problem is, he also doesn’t want me to have coffee equipment, whichI have out of sight, for when he’s gone. He says that just the fact that he knows I have it somewhere makes him think of coffee and is triggering. If we go on a hike or something, I also can’t buy myself a coffee and have it infront of him. I thought fine, I’ll always go to a cafe by myself on the weekends, (which is not cheap, as we live in an expensive country), but he would also have issues with that, because then he’ll be envious and triggered. So basically he wants me to only have coffee at work or when I’m away and he doesn’t know about it, and not have any at all on the weekends. 

I feel like I already came forward with compromises, but it still isn’t enough for him. Having an entire weekend without coffee would make me feel super resentful, an obviously I’d have withdrawal. And I don’t want to cut back. He keeps comparing it to different drug addictions, and honestly he’s right - it is a drug and it is an addiction. The whole society is addicted to coffee, and he often criticises it. So he’s making me feel bad for not willing to “manage my addiction” for him, and I honestly don’t know how to argument against that. At the same time, I still feel like it’s not fair, like why should someone else manage my coffee consumption.

I feel like I’m making compromises but he’s just not willing to make any. 
I know so many couples, in which both parties smoked cigarettes, and one person quit. Were they annoyed/disgusted by the other person for still smoking? Sometimes. But they didn’t *force* their partner to quit too, bacuse it’s a personal decision.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1of3gtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrvalor/comments/1of3gtt/looking_for_final_truth_of_life_so_here_that/,looking for final truth of life ? so here that purpose is,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

 I woke up, still in that alleyway, so I then looked at myself and well...  
 ""Nah, what the f\*ck is this?!"" I said as I felt a bruise on my head, and lots of dark spots in my arms, body, and pants, ""what time is it?""  
 Suddenly, an old homeless guy, who's wearing ripped jeans, old leather shoes, a blue jacket, a white t-shirt, and a beanie, wield a guitar, but he looked at me.  
 ""4:42 AM pa lang, anak,"" (It's still 4:42 AM, son.) he said as he looked at his pocket watch, ""at bakit ka mukhang ganyan?"" (And why do you look like that?).  
 ""Wala lang po, isang labanan lang,"" (It's nothing, just a fight.) I just replied.  
 ""Hindi yan pwede, at hindi ka pa nakakain ng almusal!"" (That's not acceptable, and you still hadn't ate your breakfast!) he exclaimed in surprise, ""huwag muna akong bigyan ng pera, sapagka't kakailanganin mo para sa iyong gamot."" (don't give me money for now, for you'll need it for your medicine.)  
 ""Salamat po,"" (Thank you.) I replied.  
 ""Walang anuman,"" (You're welcome.) he replied.  
 So I took my big luggage on a roll and immediately went to the pharmacy, which was filled with long lines and full of medicines that just says ""sold out.""  
 ""T\*NGINA NIYO, MGA WALANG KWENTANG P\*TA! WALA PA KAYONG PARACETAMOL SA LOOB NG TATLONG ARAW?! P\*KYU!"" (F\*CK YOU, YOU USELESS P\*TAS! YOU ALL STILL DON'T HAVE PARACETAMOL FOR THREE DAYS STRAIGHT?! P\*KYU!) a mother of 3 screamed at the staff before grabbing a nearby coffee cup in the trash and throwing at them before leaving with her kids.  
 ""ANO?! WALA NANG COUGH SYRUP?! HOY, MGA G\*GO, PUMUNTA AKO GALING SA LANSANGAN AT SINAKRIPISYO KO ANG APAT NA BUWAN PARA LANG DITO?! NAKAKAHIYA, MGA HAYOP NA TAMAD BUMILI NG SUPPLY, BU\*ISIT NA SIYUDAD NA ITO!"" (WHAT?! THERE'S NO MORE COUGH SYRUP?! HEY, MORON, I CAME FROM THE SQUATTER AREA AND I SACRIFICED FOUR MONTHS FOR THIS S\*IT?! EMBARRASSING, YOU ANIMALS THAT ARE LAZY TO BUY SUPPLIES, THIS CITY'S S\*IT AS F\*CK!) a man said on another line, and he left after slapping the cashier.  
 ""Damn, the medicine shortage is hitting this city hard specifically, if only it could be like it's other city, West Ginto Town. This East Ginto Town really is corrupt,"" I said.  
 I immediately came to the front and asked for some ointment for the wounds. Thankfully, they have it, but it's the last one and nearing the expiry date.  
 I immediately left, just in time as the people forming the queues gathered into crowd and start beating cashiers and everyone up.  
 So, I managed to go to a public bathroom nearby, showered there, dressed myself up, and went first to a convenience store to ask their cashier something for a favor after I packed my school bag.  
 ""Please leave this, I'll come back by 3:30 PM,"" I said.  
 ""Sure,"" she replied.  
 So I left my big luggage, took a tricycle to my school, put on some ointment on the way, then dropped myself off. There, I was thankfully on time, 5 minutes before the flag ceremony.  
 After that, class continued as usual as I dragged myself on, in spite of injuries.  
 After that, I finally took a tricycle ride back to my house after my best friend told me the address to my new house, I also took back my luggage along the way.  
 ""You're back,"" said my father, ""why didn't you even bother coming back earlier?""  
 ""I didn't know the address, ok?!"" I replied.  
 ""You're a f\*cking loser, don't you know that??"" he asked.  
 ""I'm sorry, you're a f\*cking deadbeat, aren't you?"" I retorted.  
 He immediately grabbed me by the arm.  
 ""Son, shut your f\*cking mouth up, I'm already tired of your little whining a\*s,"" he said, coldly.  
 ""F-f-fine!"" I said before he puts me down.  
 Suddenly, my mother came down and opened the TV.  
 My mother, father, elder sister, younger sister, younger brother, grandmother, and me, though reluctantly, gathered in the couch, waiting for what our mayor had to say.  
 "".... East Gintonians, I know about the shortage of the medicines in the Philippines, which affects our city badly. However, unfortunately, the medicines which would arrive are in few. So we will require ration cards. Application for ration cards will be at our city hall. Also, I have passed a law which will not allow strikes and protests as it will disrupt day-to-day operations of our authorities. That is all,"" he said, smirking.  
 ""This sucks!"" I screamed, ""f\*cking gnarly!""  
 ""Are you seriously listening to Katseye?"" my elder sister asked.  
 I just ignored her, took a shower, ate some snacks as my dinner, did my assignments, and went to my bedroom which was in my basement. Comfortable enough but no aircon.  
 ""Everything's gnarly, I guess,"" I said before...  

 *Interlinking Worlds...*
 ""Paradise...,"" I said.  
 This is it...

 We just landed in France, and immediately fought lots of Gray Skibidi Toilets in the area.  
 While I was using my bolos to decapitate 4 Gray Skibidi Toilets, I literally saw Maddie grabbing a Gray Skibidi Toilet by its head and slamming him against Filipino TV Woman, killing him by brute force.  
 ""What the f\*ck?!"" Filipino TV Woman screamed when she fell, ""are you a dumb b\*tch or what?!""  
 ""It's called being smart,"" replied Maddie.  
 Filipino TV Man just sighed.  
 ""I forgot to tell you, Berns, they have a rivalry and that s\*it can happen if left unchecked,"" he said to me.  
 Suddenly, lots of metallic scraping were heard...  
 ""Uh, guys... are advanced troops arriving?!"" I asked, panicking...  
 Marie, Maria, Kevin, Calvin, Bob, Smith, James, and even Larry hid behind Francisco.  
 ""Dude, you guys are not fitting behind me, and also, try not to be scaredy-cats,"" Francisco said, preparing his baseball bat with rusted nails, ""also, Pierre, what are you staring at??""  
 Suddenly... Emmanuel Macron, yes, the French Prime Minister that got converted into a Skibidi Toilet, came alongside his troops who has the same upgrades as him.  
 ""Ah, so it's you, Pierre, the Speakerman of France!"" he said in a French accent.  
 Filipino TV Woman and Filipino TV Man just stood beside Francisco while I can't see Maddie.  
 ""Aren't you the same guy who married your own high school teacher?"" Filipino TV Woman asked angrily.  
 ""Hey hey hey hey hey!"" Filipino TV Man immediately stopped her there.  
 ""We don't talk about that part, b\*tch!"" Macron replied before shooting his lasers at their direction, which is on my left.  
 Francisco and his squad, Filipino TV Woman, and Filipino TV Man all ducked behind building debris.  
 Suddenly, I felt a touch in my right arm. I looked around, it's Maddie, holding my arm.  
 ""H-h-hey..."" she said sheepishly.  
 ""TROOPS! GET THIS FRENCH SPEAKERMAN AND BRING HIM TO ME! WE'RE TAKING HIM HOME!"" Macron replied before a Skibidi Mutant carried him away and then they flew away.  
 Literally the French Skibidi Troops all blasted their lasers and their rocket launchers, collapsing buildings and even 1 rocket launcher was sent toward us, almost killing ourselves had it not been for Maddie suddenly hugging me and pulling me back to the sidewalk, where we both fell.  
 ""I-i-i don't know why I have feelings for you, Bern, I shouldn't have while we're at war..."" she said as we sat and then stood up again.  
 ""You have nothing to lose if you admit,"" I said jokingly when a French Skibidi Troop came to us.  
 ""Any last words, lovebirds?"" he asked.  
 ""Go f\*ck yourself, frog-face,"" Maddie said, who then held my right shoulder.  
 ""F\*ck you too, VIVE LE TOILETE DE SKIBIDI-"" he replied and just reloaded his launchers and about to shoot its lasers had it not been for Francisco bashing his head with his bat, killing him.  
 ""So, what does love feel like, Bernie?"" Francisco asked.  
 ""Uh..."" I got shy.  
 ""Madison! We just finished beating up these f\*ckers. Only 2 out of 15 escaped and joined Macron in their retreat,"" Filipino TV Man said.  
 ""Understandable,"" as Maddie pulled herself away from me and recomposed herself, ""I'm surprised we managed to beat 13 of these heavily-armed French f\*ckers.""  
 ""Yeah, while you 2 only killed 1 because you were both busy playing with each other,"" Filipino TV Woman said before literally getting chastised by everyone, ""keep the insults coming, I don't give a f\*ck.""  
 ""I killed 2,"" Larry said.  
 ""Wow, that's nice, I killed 3 with my **own**  hands while Filipino TV Man had to help you kill 2,"" Pierre replied sourly.  
 ""Filipino TV Woman, I don't like your attitude,"" Maddie said.  
 ""Why? Because you're afraid to admit you have a crush on Bernie?"" she replied.  
 Maddie was seen ""blushing,"" but she immediately regained composure and got angry at Filipino TV Woman.  
 ""You do realize you're not the leader right? And you do realize you're gossiping right?"" she said.  
 ""Well, I'm sorry you had to show your affection for him while we're at war!"" Filipino TV Woman replied, ""you 2 could've died and we'd be left with a fool (Filipino TV Man).""  
 ""Well, shut your f\*cking whining b\*tch a\*s up! It's natural!"" said Maddie.  
 Filipino TV Man immediately grabbed Filipino TV Woman angrily.  
 ""You guys can leave, us 2 are staying and will follow,"" Filipino TV Man said. "">:(""  
 ""So... someone is in love?"" Larry asked.

But I think you’ll get what I’m saying. 

I live in an absolutely gorgeous and incredibly safe affluent, very remote, very tiny mountain town in Colorado. There is basically no crime here. I don’t lock my car or my house ever and neither does anyone else. I have a sweet apartment at a very reasonable rate. My commute to my incredibly chill, super flexible, and decent paying job with a super nice boss is about 7 minutes. 15 minutes if I take the free and usually empty bus. I can mountain bike out of my driveway. My dog can be off leash basically all the time. The ski resort is literally right behind my house. I can walk there in like 20 minutes or take a different free bus up the hill. I can walk to the grocery store, coffee shops, restaurants, etc in like 10 minutes. I do have to drive 30 minutes to get groceries and real healthcare is like 2-4 hours away, airport is 4-5 hours, etc. 

HOWEVER I have been here for 2 years. I’ve made 3 real friends here and they all moved away. I haven’t had a date in over a year, and I’ve only dated one person here for like two months. Neither of those things have ever been an issue anywhere else. I have volunteered, joined local groups, have a fairly social job, etc. I guess I just don’t have the right personality for this town. I’m lonely and isolated AF. 

I’m from western NC. My very tiny bio family still lives there and I’m close with them. I go back often and I make friends there so much more easily. Random people on the trail, in bike shops, coffe shops, etc. My mom still lives in the house I grew up in, she stole (or fell in love with and I let her have) one of my dogs who I miss dearly, my brother is there, etc. I also prefer the mountain biking there and don’t really care about skiing anymore and want to get away from cold winters. Also dating would be much easier. 

however, the crime is so much worse there, the weather is worse, the traffic is exponentially worse, the poverty is much worse and going to get even worse under Trump, the hurricanes and wildfires are getting worse. The big one is that the rent is about the same as I pay now but the pay is much worse, and so is the job market in general.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Been together nearly 8 years. I absolutely love that woman, and we work so well together. But her brother in law has always been a pain in the ass from the start. 

He very quickly decided for some reason that the best way to deal with me is to just pretend I'm not there: if i ask him a question or how he's doing, he won't respond. He'll talk to other people around us exclusively, such as his wife, his sister, mother and family friends. 

It's gotten to the point I know there's other people who have mentioned it to him. But he doesn't care. I've tried to have a conversation with him at least once, but we've never even had that. The most important ever got was how I was doing and whether I wanted a coffee once. 

Things got quite stressful during the covid pandemic, as he was getting married in that time, so when he had to reduce numbers he uninvited me and asked my mother in law to be to tell my SO. This devastated her and me. Yes, he had to reduce numbers, but it conveniently turned out I was the only partner who wouldn't be invited as a plus one at that point. I was then reinvited when numbers and wedding restrictions lifted and seriously considered not going. But I went as my SO begged me. 

Since he and his wife have had children, I feel more tense. I don't feel welcome at his home, I know his wife tries to talk to me to include me in things, but it just makes things awkward when he clearly tries to have conversations in the room with others as if I'm not there. He tells his children to hug his sister and doesn't mention me. 

I've heard what he says when I'm not around, but not all of it. About how it's not natural for families to have same sex parents or how immigrants are taking over the country and the nation is losing it's way, or jokes about mixed race couples But since none of it is ever mentioned when I'm around, I'm limited in what i can do. 

The prospect of having to endure this for the rest of my life is a wearying one. I have spoken with my partner about it, and it upsets her. I feel awful as she wants him to come to the wedding, and i don't anymore, even if he won't have an active role in it. I feel I've been treated invisibly for too long to want him there, and she says she can't help how he acts but since her father passed away 10 years he's the last link she's got to him. She has suggested asking him not to come with great effort, but then that means our sister in law won't come. 

So, how do I resolve this? This piece of shit is coming to the wedding. I've cut out others from the RSVP list who have treated me poorly this year, but he's exempt. How do I just accept it? 

TLDR: my brother in law to be has acted for nearly 8 years as if i don't exist. How do I just accept that's the way things are going to be? Nothing i can do will resolve it without ripping up family dynamics. ",1,1761325347.0,family,1,1.0,False

Here’s a full list of the most common questions about fasting — with simple answers:

# 🕒 General Fasting Questions

**Q: Should I fast every day?**  
A: It depends on the type of fast. A **12–16 hour intermittent fast** daily is safe for most people. Longer fasts (24+ hours) are usually done 1–2 times per week, not daily.

**Q: Is it safe to fast every day?**  
A: Yes, if you’re doing intermittent fasting (12–16 hours). Extended daily fasting (18–20 hours or OMAD) can be safe for some, but isn’t ideal for everyone long-term.

**Q: Who should fast every day?**  
A: Healthy adults looking for weight loss, better digestion, or energy control often do well.

**Q: Who should NOT fast?**  
A:

* Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* Children & teens (still growing).
* People with eating disorders.
* Those with diabetes, low blood pressure, or certain medical conditions (unless cleared by a doctor).

**Q: Is sleeping part of the fast?**  
A: Yes ✅ — your sleeping hours count toward your fasting window. That’s why overnight fasting is the easiest way to start.

# 💪 Fitness & Muscle Questions

**Q: Can I work out while fasting?**  
A: Yes. Light to moderate workouts (walking, yoga, weight training) are safe. Many even report **better fat burn** when exercising fasted.

**Q: Will fasting make me lose muscle?**  
A: Not if you eat enough protein when you break your fast. Growth hormone rises during fasting, which actually **helps preserve muscle**.

**Q: What’s the best time to work out when fasting?**  
A: Many do well training at the **end of a fast** (before eating). Others prefer after breaking the fast for better strength.

**Q: Should I take supplements while fasting?**  
A: Most vitamins/minerals are best taken with food. But **electrolytes, magnesium, potassium, or pink salt water** are safe during fasting.

# 🍵 Food & Drink Questions

**Q: Can I drink water while fasting?**  
A: Yes, water is essential. Stay hydrated.

**Q: Does coffee break a fast?**  
A: Black coffee (no cream, no sugar) does **not** break a fast. It can even suppress hunger.

**Q: Does tea break a fast?**  
A: Herbal teas (no sweetener) are fine. Green tea, peppermint, and cinnamon are great hunger busters.

**Q: Does bone broth break a fast?**  
A: Yes technically (calories & protein), but it’s one of the healthiest ways to **end** a fast.

**Q: Does chewing gum break a fast?**  
A: Sugar-free gum usually doesn’t affect fasting, but too much artificial sweetener can cause insulin spikes in sensitive people.

**Q: What foods are best to break a fast?**  
A: Start light: bone broth, soup, fruit, eggs, or salad. Avoid heavy fried/junk foods.

# 🌿 Health & Healing Questions

**Q: What health issues can fasting help with?**

* Weight loss & belly fat.
* Insulin resistance & blood sugar balance.
* Inflammation & bloating.
* Digestion & gut healing.
* Energy crashes & brain fog.

**Q: Can fasting help with mental clarity?**  
A: Yes ✅ — many report sharper focus, calmness, and better memory during fasts.

**Q: Does fasting detox the body?**  
A: Yes. Autophagy (cell cleanup) removes damaged proteins, toxins, and even weak cells.

**Q: Can fasting help with skin?**  
A: Some people see clearer skin, reduced acne, and anti-aging benefits from fasting due to reduced inflammation and autophagy.

# 🧘 Lifestyle & Mindset Questions

**Q: Is fasting just skipping meals?**  
A: Not exactly. It’s about creating a rhythm for your body, balancing hormones, and giving your digestion a break.

**Q: Is fasting the same as starving?**  
A: No. Fasting is intentional and controlled. Starving is when you have no choice.

**Q: Can fasting be spiritual?**  
A: Absolutely. Many cultures fast for clarity, discipline, and deeper spiritual connection.

**Q: How do I deal with hunger while fasting?**  
A:

* Drink water or tea.
* Stay busy.
* Add salt to water.
* Remember: hunger comes in **waves** — it passes!

**Q: How long should beginners fast?**  
A: Start with 12 hours, then slowly build to 14–16. Only try 24-hour fasts once you’re comfortable.

I asked what was wrong, what happened, and he hesitated to tell me. He asked me why I wanted to know. I kept asking and asked if it was related to the coffee machine, and to just tell me if it was. He said that his mother threw the pods out because they were expired, supposedly. This was after he told me yesterday they weren't and that some of them were sealed, which I know they were. He said that she gave the machine to his brother to take to the skip. 

He said she thought we weren't using it, that we didn't want it, since it sat in the attic for a long time and then we put it downstairs. That she got scared when he got angry over it yesterday. He said that she apologized. He told her that she should've asked. I don't like his mother, and have had issues with her, and so I wondered if this was personal. I asked if she knew it was a gift to me. He said she wouldn't have remembered that because it was three years ago. That she thought we got it together meaning she would've known it was partially mine. I said it felt personal and he told me it wasn't, and that is where I take things too far. 

If I'm honest, I strongly feel like throwing someone else's belongings away be it his brother or his mother's. I know the drama that would be caused by it. Perhaps it would teach them both a lesson. I think something's wrong with all of them, including my husband, and I'm equally as angry with him. Especially because of how much he minimizes and excuses their behavior. How he gets angry whenever I get angry and rightfully criticize them, when I don't just let things go. She messaged him saying sorry and offering to let us take the money from a laptop, which goes for around £100, that she was listing for sell. He said that the machine is £80 now and I could repurchase it. I don't want the money.

I've tried getting a shaker bottle with the wire ball but the powder just clumps up inside the ball and I have to use something else to get it out. I've tried using twice the amount of liquid and half the powder. Currently, the best way I've found is to pour about half the liquid, about half the powder, mix a little with a fork, add the rest of the liquid and powder, then mix enthusiastically forever. Stopping occasionally to squish some of the clumps against the side of the cup. Then slowly adding to my coffee when I get bored of mixing and just deal with the little lumps.

*Long Post*

 

I am in need of some advice regarding a relationship situation

 

To begin with me and my Girlfriend just celebrated a year together and she made a post on Facebook about us and changed her profile picture to us. Made me a mixtape of all the songs i have sent her this past year on Spotify. We mesh very well together, we are different but alike in a lot of ways. We have mutual attraction to each other, even a very strong energetic draw. Our sex is great when we do have it but its only like one to three times every two weeks. however,  we don't live together and she has kids so typical challenges.

 

While reading this, I want everyone to keep in mind that I struggle with anxious attachment which I am going to therapy to address.

 

in the Beginning she was a lot more flirty and texted more spicy messages, Nothing too crazy as she said she has never been much of a spicy texter. Everything came to a crawl about 6 months in (end of the honeymoon phase). She started texting less, seemed just overall less interested in sex..etc. I have always struggled to get into her mind sexually. she doesn't share with me when she self pleases, or that she was thinking of that one time, etc. However, when we do have sex, it is amazing if we are both into it. I will say this change did happen in the middle of a medication change from Strattera to Prozac,  so this could be a contributing factor.

 

This also happened to coincide with easter weekend and we were partying with some friends. There was a guy there that seemed funny, good looking, Whitty, etc. Well after we were intimate I had to leave for family commitments. I was just her, her girl friends, and two guys. I am pretty sure nothing happened but at some point that weekend a conversation was had about uncircumsized guys. My Girl prefers them, but it is not a deal breaker for her.  I am not sure what other interactions where had between them either and I don't think she would tell me. She is against cheating and has stated her opinion about it several times. I believe her as she is a very honest person and wouldn't drag someone along for something like that. she would just end the relationship.

 

Well fast forward a  few months, her and said guy became friends on Facebook.  Recently she has been posting more and  more on her Facebook stories, and this guy has been commenting on her post. well a few weekends ago I decided to something cute and funny. she was coming over for the weekend and I made an alien crash site in my bed. green balloons with alien faces, tin foil as crash wreckage, green lights and glow sticks, etc. Then I wanted to do a tantric  mediation, spiritual reconnect and I could tell she was getting impatient as I was reading and she just was not into it. I stopped and asked her what was wrong. She said that I go over the top sometimes and she just wanted a quite evening no expectations. I wasn't expecting anything except a smile and laugh. Then we got in a emotional discussion about how she doesn't think she is enough for me and I got triggered and thought she was trying to push me away. we both cried, she almost left, but we talked through it. I came out and told her my guy instinct about the easter weekend, how I thought she was into the guy, and he is uncircumsized. She said she is not into him at all and she is glad that I told her about how I was feeling.

 

Fast forward to the past could of weeks. he has made a few comments on her Facebook post and she laugh reacts all the time. I will say I would never try to control who someone interacts with in any way. However, after I told her how I felt, She posted an ad rehoming one of her roosters and he commented with the following comment and she laughed reacted to it:

 

""Well no one warned me of this shit...if I knew I was gonna wake up and first thing i see is someone with a legit ad trying to dish out free cock, it would have kept the coffee off my kitchen floor and not in my sinus cavity"".

 

Not sure how to take this comment. I know he is probably just trying to be funny, but I feel there is a deeper message. However, If I had just had a conversation with my partner who I know has anxious attachment issues, I would have not laugh reacted. I don’t mind the post being there because that is one him. I do mind she laugh reacted.

 

She then reassured me that she loves my body and her comment was, ""I am not even attracted to him so there is that"".

 

I guess I am just trying to figure out her mind. I am only attracted to her and have a very deep love for her and I know she feels the same way. I just feel something is not being said.

I have a lot of nerve pain since my mastocytosis turned on. From research is seems to be neurogenic inflammation from the mast cell degranulation byproducts which overly sensitizes the nerves, but still OUCH. 

Before I got on Ayvakit I had full body ant bite like pain and now it’s concentrated in my feet, calves and hands, and sometimes face and chiand feels like either heat pain or the kind of pain you get when you fall down and scrape yourself on the sidewalk. 

Low dose naltrexone for a full year did a buttload of nothing. Amytryptiline, nortryptiline, gabapentin, and lyrica make it worse and I get crazy full body parasthesias. Steroids can also make the intensity worse. 
I’m at the point where my pain doctor wants to put me on either journavx or opiates to help.
I will say, I think it’s inflammation related because it gets significantly worse when I drink or eat things that irritate my mastocytosis (like coffee, tea, anything with even a whisper of garlic or onion or tomato etc).

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

The blinds were half-drawn. Dust hung in the stale air, catching light from the film projector. A photo flickered onto the screen — a blurred passport image, smiling but hollow.

Hanratty stood at the front of the room, sleeves rolled, tie slightly off-center. He tapped the photo with a wooden pointer. The photo contains a passport and an ID of our Prepertrator 

> “This man — this name — doesn’t exist.”

""Next slide please."" The projector clicked, now showing even more fake IDs

> “He’s gone by Taylor, Elliot, Shaw, Lanning… the names don’t matter. What matters is the pattern. Every time he moves, he leaves a trail of paper that shouldn’t exist — perfect, clean, and wrong.”

> “He’s not greedy. Not really. He’s… careful. Patient. Which makes him dangerous. Most forgers slip up after the first payout. This one stays for the second, even the third. He wants to be the man he pretends to be.”

""Next slide Please."" Another click — a map lit up. Red pins marked airports, banks, and hotels, stretching from across the globe, Ignicis, Coaldmines, Navaria Mainland, Furna Islands

> “He’s always just ahead. Always knows when we’re coming. He’s not running randomly — he’s chasing something. I don’t know what yet, but I will.”



He paused. The hum of the projector filled the silence.

> “We’ve been chasing ghosts. But this one leaves fingerprints, just not on glass. He leaves them in the timing, the signatures, the gaps between phone calls. Find those, and we find him. He's not on the mainland now that's for sure”



The room stayed quiet. Hanratty looked over the faces before him — tired men, empty coffee cups, the weight of futility.

> “He’s clever, but he’s not invisible. Everyone makes a mistake eventually.”



He clicked the projector off. The room dimmed back to gray.

> “We just have to be there when he does.”

It was confusing because when i would see her next she'd be lovebombing me again, telling me she will help me with all this stuff then repeat the same cycle. She even admitted that she leaks out her frustration with me because she knows i will tolerate it and be willing to sort it out with her (to my detriment as it keeps me bed bound which she is aware of) but would never do it woth one of her other friends because she knows her friend would never talk to her again...we when through the same process again and this time i stood up for myself and said of we dont talk about this within the next week then ill have to walk away from this relationship anf she said ""i dont accept, im not meeting you for a coffee in the week anymore, ill jist see you at the support group"" (she completly ignored my boundary and set her own) i resp9nded with how broken i felt and that i thought it was a safe space to share how we felt and that as she always says im her friend she'd want to sort this out with me then she stonewalled me for 2 weeks which made me very ill so i blocked her off whatsapp. It's been 2 months now and i havent heard from this lady who i spent 2 years trauma bonded with, we talked every day, she made me feel like shed always be part of my life and now shes gone and i feel heartbroken and devasatated because now i have noone.. i know i blocked her on whatsapp after she stonewalled me and left me in a shame spiral for 2 weeks but she could still message me on normal message or call me, she lives quite clpse and knows where i live to and she hasnt come and has just left me, i feel so broken  :(",2,1761325026.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

Three months ago I finally caved and bought an Anthbot Genie 1000, and figured it’s time to spill the truth, the good, the bad, and the “wtf is it doing now?” moments.

First off, I hate mowing. Always have. Allergies, gas fumes, the noise, the sweating… nope. I’d rather do literally anything else. Last year I was paying someone to mow twice a week, and it ended up costing more than what I paid for this mower (plus parts). So yeah, I wanted a “set it and forget it” solution that just quietly minds its own business while I drink coffee.

Setup was surprisingly chill. Took maybe an afternoon to map my zones (I’ve got 10 total). The app’s pretty intuitive, and scheduling’s easy once you get the hang of it. The only annoying bit. The antenna placement. That thing is PICKY. I swear I moved it five times before it stopped losing signal. Pro tip: get the wall-mount kit or make your own, it’s worth it.

First few weeks were kinda rough ngl. It got stuck on roots, curbs, that one stupid decorative stone I keep forgetting to move… I had to go save it almost daily at first. On steep slopes (mine’s about 25–28°) it sometimes slipped, but it learned the terrain surprisingly fast.

After 3 months, the lawn looks amazing. The cut is super even, no random patches. My grass actually looks healthier now, probably because it’s getting frequent trims instead of one big weekend massacre. I still do a bit of edge trimming here and there, but overall, it’s been life-changing. Any regrets? Nope. It’s not totally hands-off. You do need to babysit it a bit in the beginning, but once you dial it in, it’s like a quiet little gardener that just gets it done.

Having rewatched this episode recently, I feel like it kind of flies under the radar when it comes to Simpsons classics, even though it has all the classic characteristics with great writing and clever, unexpected humor.  And of course the legend himself Rodney Dangerfield, which if you know Rodney, makes Larry's personality all the more funnier.  From the apple factory to Mr Burns ancient past to Larry's phony kidnapping, this episode kept me laughing the entire time 29 years ago and still does today.  Here are some of my favorite quotes:

>Ned on the apple tour: “Hey, word to the wise...season pass!  It pays for itself after the sixteenth visit.”

>

>Larry yelling at train: “Hey, Casey Jones, where's this train headed?”  
Conductor: “Springfield.”  
Larry: “Yeah, yeah. What state?”

>Smithers when Larry knocks on the door looking for Burns: “Well, I hate to break it to you, LARRY, but if Mr. Burns ever wants to see a stranger, he will observe him through a powerful telescope”.

> 

>Mr Burns realizing Larry is his son: “Ah, Larry, my lad, I've gone over this story in my mind a million times.  It was 1941, the... No, '39...” Burns flashes back to the outdoors of the 25th Yale reunion.

> 

>Woman at dinner: “Larry, you must meet our daughter, the debutante.   She came out last spring.”

>Larry: “Whoa!  Put her back in!  She's not done yet!”

> 

>Yale woman on Larry's test scores: “Let's just say this: he spelled ""Yale"" with a six.”

> 

>Larry after Mr Burns rejects him: “Nah... I know what I gotta do.  I gotta clean up my act.  No more joking around all the time.  No more slacking off at work.  And most important, no more booze! I know I can do it.”

>Burns: \[reading a letter\] ""Your son has been kidnapped.""

>Kent Brockman seeing Homer and Larry from news chopper: “Appearing in broad daylight with police everywhere, ladies and gentlemen, there's only one word for that: idiocy.”

> 

>Larry: “We've gotta find someplace to hide.”  Show a local costume shop.  Moments later, two men dressed in a gorilla and organ-grinder costume exit the shop.  The owner of the store catches Homer and Larry sitting fearfully inside the bathroom.

> 

>Moleman at movie theater: “Shh!  Some people are trying to watch the movie.”

>  Homer: “You don't like it, call the cops.”  \[throws popcorn at him, both laugh\]

> 

>Larry: “Aw, that's okay.  I got a wife and kids.  Oh, that reminds me.  They're probably wondering where I went.  I told 'em I'm going for coffee.  That was a week ago.”",2,1761324808.0,Simpsons,3,0.75,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

1of2u12,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQE_Prep/comments/1of2u12/sqe1_experience_july_2025/,SQE1 Experience - July 2025,"I passed the SQE1 on my first attempt in July 2025. In my last 2 months of preparation, this subreddit helped me focus on some of the items that proved important in the exam preparation. This is my attempt of giving back to the community.

 

Background and Setup:

I actively started preparing sometime in Q2 2024. However, I tore my ACL in my right knee playing basketball in June. My wife subsequently told me that we will be expecting twins in January 2025, making me postpone my SQE1 attempt to from January 2025 to July 2025.

I hold a senior managing position in a major investment bank, working full time and more. I am a lawyer who qualified and practiced law in an Eastern-European country for about 5-6 years and has since emigrated to a Western-European country and is doing a job that has a loose connection with law. My goal with SQE is to gain expertise and standing when it comes to providing legal services in the English language. I never had contact with English law before.

In theory, I had plenty of time with almost a full year until the exam, but with a lot of responsibilities on the side and many uncertainties too. I underwent ACL surgery in September and started training with a strength & conditioning coach from mid-October. The training regimen was 5 times a week of about 2 hours each not including prep time and extra work. I had only some late evenings, early mornings and weekends to study.

Sick leave and tending to my newborns took away at least 2 clean months out in total.

I was entitled to a few months of parental leave and I timed one of those before my last exam date. My exam times were moved multiple times (thanks, Kaplan) and I ended up with only 3 days in-between FLK 1 and 2. Therefore, I had a month of full-time studying counting back from my FLK 2 date.

 

Course Provider:

The first and the most important choice one has to make is the prep provider choice. I would not recommend doing SQE without a prep provider. Yes, I know it can be done, but it's just too risky. If you are an elite Commonwealth lawyer with plenty of years of experience under your belt, by all means - go ahead. For other mortals like myself, prep provider is a logical choice.

Also, once you start investing time, effort, and money into this, you do not want all that to go to waste. The worst thing you can do to yourself is to resit this exam. I went with QLTS School and I cannot recommend them enough. They are 'tough love' with their mocks and study material, but have the most accurate ""feel"" mocks and the best summaries.

I studied from summaries, with several areas such as solicitors accounts, ethics, business law, and tax law supplemented by the books. Sometimes, I also searched online for some topics. The QLTS School's videos are (mostly) books regurgitated, and I haven't found them useful - someone else probably would. The material offered is vast and catered to different studying techniques. One does not have to use all of their material to succeed.  
The key prep point was using an LLM of your choice for case law. Define your prompt and case summary format (e.g. background, facts, outcome, legal principle) and start compiling your own book of case law. One book or summary page can contain 5-10-15 case law references and you need to have summaries for each of those cases handy in order to learn the black letter law. This will be very slow and tedious in the beginning but will prove invaluable when revising down the line.

I had a snoop at other providers' material and I my personal view is that QLTS School has the most consistent and general approach to SQE of the lot. Others lack in certain aspects, such as Barbri severely lacking (my 2 cents) in the quality/reality of mock test. Others do have solid mocks, like ReviseSQE, but lack in study material quality. I am not offering or earning anything here, just saying that I would not gamble my time and effort to save 2-3k EUR by saving on a service provider. If you do not have the money, I suggest earning it before you embark on your SQE journey. In the end, it's up to you.

 

Mental Aspect:

My view is that the SQE is not primarily a legal test. Yes, it tests legal knowledge but one can replace the subject matter with economics, engineering, math, etc., and the test would present the same exact challenges to the candidate. That being said, you should think very carefully why would you want to be a solicitor, how it betters your life, what opportunities does it create, and so forth. Thinking is done before you decide to attempt SQE, not during preparation. The more you think at this point, the less self-questioning and self-doubt you will have later. Once you commit, there can only be one outcome - passing the exam.

In my case, it was very simple - I will never practice law outside my home country without it. Coming from a generation of legal professionals, part of my identity is being a lawyer and I understood this exam as a life-or-death situation. My approach was one of admiration, respect, curiosity, and a whole lot of burning desire to smash it amidst all the setbacks.

The exam panel is agnostic to your conditions. They do not care about any of your personal circumstances (apart from those happening on test day and within the exam regulation booklet) and your exam will be graded fairly together with all the people who took it in your exam window. Nobody really cares if you are thirsty, are in debt, or studying from a coffee shop. Complaining will not help, there is no one to hear it. The only ones who can help you or care are your family, employer (if you're lucky), and the Man above. I do not want to sound condescending, but I really didn't understand the complaining on this subreddit - ""I cannot focus"", ""I need to drink water"", ""I have such and such disease, sounds alert me"", etc. Complaining will do nothing for you - apply for reasonable adjustments instead. Someone has it better than you, someone has it worse. You are you. Therefore, you can save yourself some effort and just ignore all the feelings you might have about the exam.

My main mental hurdle was not being able to spend time with my newborns. I had to be selfish and take as much time as possible which left me with a terrible sense of guild and self-questioning. Everyone was taking pictures and spending time with them. I had to study for things I 100% knew will never be useful to me down the line (think conveyancing). Those who have kids will know what I'm talking about. Also, I had to work out a lot to heal my injury both before and after they were born. The last month before the exam, I sent them all to their grandparents and went into full monk mode, studying and doing mocks from 10AM to 2AM.

Studying for SQE makes one constantly strapped for time. There is never enough of it.

 

Study Plan and Execution:

I decided to go over the course material once, then do a single mock for each area, repeating the cycle twice:

1. FLK 1 material + FLK 1 mock
2. FLK 2 material + FLK 2 mock
3. FLK 1 material + FLK 2 mock
4. FLK 2 material + FLK 2 mock
5. Free revise + mocks after every revise

Afterwards, I planned to go into daily mocks and free revision. Things did not go exactly according to plan as going over the material proved to be too time consuming. Studying from summaries means that you have a very vague sentence about something that you have to research in depth to understand it. For example, Tort and Contract law are like that. Sometimes it took me a full day of studying just to go over 5-6 pages. On the other side, the books are just too long and are very revision-unfriendly. Betting on summaries in the long run proved to be the right call. In my final form, I could effectively revise an entire FLK 1 or FLK 2 within a single day.

It soon became clear that I will run into an issue with time. Without understanding black letter law that well, I went into mocks and started scoring horribly. You will see a table with my results below. Some mocks I did twice, as I ran out of time. I purposefully left them in kind of a chronological timeline, so that you can see how my results improved, but the percentages did not skyrocket.

Keep in mind you need at least 6-7 hours for a single mock - 2h33m to complete a mock and then at least as much time to go over the questions and see where you did wrong. This is where the magic happens as you will sometimes repeat the same mistakes, indicating you do not know the legal principles involved.

One other thing the mocks do is teach you exam pacing and mechanical training which boosts overall confidence. You need to feel the weight of decision for each question, learn the mechanics regarding flagging and revising, as well as time awareness. I had 5 ""gates"" and knew exactly where I need to be with each passing gate. I always aimed to leave 15 minutes for flag revisioning, assuming I had about 20 questions to go back on. One hint is to use the booklet to jolt down between which options are you uncertain about. People think the booklet are to be used for tax questions, but they can be used for everything. There will usually be 2 or maybe 3 answers you are considering - note those down so that you can immediately ignore other two when you go back to the question. Chances are, you already read the premise through and through and just need to make up your mind. Little adjustments like these save you valuable time. Mocks are invaluable in this aspect.

Be very careful when going back and changing your answers. That's all I'm gonna say about that.

Also, I did many other things to prepare me for the exam. I visualized the whole process, went to the exam center and stood outside of it, imagining the exam date. I thought how would I feel if I pass or if I fail, and how my life would look in each case. I probably went through the exam experience in my head hundreds of times. With each sacrifice, the exam became more and more important.

If we count 58% as being the pass rate, I only passed 4 FLK 1 and 3 FLK 2 mocks on the first go. I passed 3 more FLK 1 mocks on the 2nd try. Realistically, you can count them in too, as the attempts are about 6 months apart. The actual exam was subjectively about 10-15% harder than the mocks.

The mental strength cannot be understated when doing mocks. I know a person who failed all but 1 of the QLTS mocks but passed the actual exam. Also, you can pass the mock but not really understand the black letter law, which is key for passing this exam. Do not worry about the mock results. Focus on why you got a particular question wrong and what was your train of thought that lead you to it.

 

Actual exam results:

FLK 1: 105/180, 2nd quintile

FLK 2: 104/180, 2nd quintile

 

 

What I did right:

1. My support network was second to none - wife was understanding, grandparents were watching the kids, and my boss was supportive of my ambitions. I felt obliged to deliver due to all those people backing me up.
2. I had the right mental attitude that forged my mental fortitude.
3. My key personal drivers were well-founded and my purpose defined.
4. My motivation was pure and I wanted to do my best and pass the exam.
5. I took the exam seriously, respected it, and gratefully received all the hardships that came along. It became a part of my daily life.
6. Buffer time was factored in, in case of setbacks.
7. I tweaked my study plan on-the-go, when I realized that I had to up the revision pace.
8. I stayed out of peer groups, mainly studying with a single friend who also passed. Maybe this is a positive or a negative, I felt it was more a positive.
9. I made sure I understand the whole exam material from end to end. This means areas such as Ethics or Solicitors' Accounts. I probably spent 2 weeks only doing Solicitors' Accounts. Also, I imagined potential scenarios from my career and asked myself would it be ethical in the SRA context.

 

 

What I did wrong or not good enough:

1. I underestimated the sheer convolutedness of the exam questions. Sometimes I wondered if they will really ask a 3-paragraph question. Yes, they will. Luckily, this subreddit alerted me to this fact.
2. I did not think I need to know black letter law by heart. However, without it, you cannot answer some questions correctly. For example, you need to know the definition of murder in order to assess the mens rea of a perpetrator in the exam question. Mocks made me go back to the drawing board and hammer this down before the exam.
3. I did not use mocks from other providers, other than the official SRA snippet. This is extremely important - the more mocks you do, the better your results will be. Yes, QLTS School has the best mocks but even other providers' simple mocks help revise the basic principles. I wish I did more mocks, my confidence would have been higher.
4. I did not realize how difficult the mental aspect would be, especially when I started scoring poorly on the mocks. Still, I kept going and going and succeeded in the end. However, a lot of the stress could have been avoided.

 

My thoughts on SQE as an exam:

It is a brutal and an unforgiving venture. The stakes are high, the pressure is high, the margin for error seems large but it is not. It lasts abnormally long, together with the 2-month wait for the results. It is by far the hardest thing that I've done, especially considering my circumstances. In fact, your success is somewhat determined by your circumstances and how far back was the last time you studied for something.

Still, it is far from not being passable. After all, 41% of the candidates passed it in July 2025 (\*ba-dum-tss\*). At first, I thought that I would learn the law and pass the exam while doing that. It turned out passing the exam is the absolute most priority, whereas learning the law anyway came along. I still remember a lot from my home bar exam in 2016, and I am sure that I will remember some of the stuff from SQE for as long as I live.

If you define your core drivers, study hard/smart, and do not take shortcuts - you will be just fine.

Always.,"Hey, I’m just looking for someone to talk to,not in a “I’m bored” way, but in a “let’s actually get to know each other” way. Someone I can text through the day, share random thoughts with, send memes, talk about life, and maybe slowly become each other’s go-to person.

I’d say I’m a mix of calm and chaos, spiritual but not religious, more into philosophies like stoicism and nihilism (with a dash of psychedelic influence). I’m a coffee addict (the stronger, the better), make dangerously good instant noodles, and lately, I’ve been experimenting with my air fryer like it’s a science project.

I love deep conversations that go from “what’s your favorite TV show?” to “what do you think happens after we die?” and back again. Humor and playfulness matter to me as much as empathy and patience, someone who can be serious and silly in equal measure.

Lately, life’s been in a bit of a transition phase, and I’d love to find someone nurturing, kind, and grounded, who’s open to growing into something meaningful, no rush, just real connection. I’m from Kerala, but open to anyone if the vibe’s right.

If you’re someone who values honesty, warmth, and latenight conversations that flow effortlessly, maybe we’ll click.

1of2t23,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1of2t23/quitting_energy_drinks_has_been_life_changing_not/,Quitting energy drinks has been life changing (not fully decaf),"I've been an energy drink consumer for as long as I can remember, going back to high school. I'm 33 now. I started with Amp, moved to Red Bull, and then settled on my one true love.....Celsius. I've been drinking 1 Celsius a day for probably close to 9 years. It became an accepted part of my daily routine. Recently I saw an article about how the artificial sugars in energy drinks are linked to Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver disease, something I was diagnosed with some years ago. I did eventually get my liver enzymes under control, but my recent blood test showed they were elevated again. That article, paired with this, gave me a wake up call. I needed to quit my addiction to Celsius finally. So one day, I had my last can that was in my fridge, and decided I was done buying any more from that point on. It has now been almost 3 weeks and some of the differences have been life changing. 

* The most shocking difference, that I didn't entirely expect, was the obvious inflammation the energy drink was causing in my body. This showed in two very specific ways.
   * Over the summer, playing Ball Hockey, I fell on my knee pretty hard in a game. For the months following that, my knee has been achey, tight and just overall not feeling great...so much so that I've been considering going to a doctor to see if I needed surgery or anything. I had been trying strengthening it with minimal relief at home. It always came back. Within DAYS of quitting Celsius, my knee aches and pain completely vanished. It still has not come back, despite beginning running training on my own outside of hockey as well as my usual hockey schedule. It feels great. I also notice my entire body just feels significantly less tight than usual when working out and when stretching. 
   * I've had scalp folliculitis for years now, not sure what the cause of it was, but it has gotten so bad in the past that I had huge random bald spots on my head from the bumps that would form on my head (usually filled with pus btw, I know TMI). After every haircut, I usually get an inflammation response that results in a bunch of bumps forming and taking a couple of weeks to resolve. I've learned to manage this with hibiclens and specific shampoo, and benzoyl peroxide cream. However, I just got my first haircut since quitting Celsius, and my scalp...is showing zero signs of being inflamed as a result. In fact, I haven't really had any of my normal issues on my scalp since I quit. I truly did not expect quitting would have any effect on this, but it seems to have very much had an effect. 
* I am sleeping much, much better and falling asleep earlier, something I usually struggle with. I do get sleepy during the day sometimes and it can cause a headache, which I believe is withdrawal related, but it's resolved easily by just taking a nap. Naps feel a lot more rewarding now as well. 
* My appetite has significantly decreased. Celsius would make me very hungry because of the mix of caffeine and green tea extract. My metabolism never had a quiet moment and it would cause me to overeat and gain weight. I feel like I now have a chance at reversing my weight gain again. 
* I just feel like I've been a better person recently. I've been more attentive to my wife, things in my life, my job etc. 
* I'm consuming probably 2x the amount of water I used to, which wasn't a lot when I drank Celsius. 

I'm still having some caffeine, usually coffee. I only do it early in the day and my rule of thumb now is for every day I have caffeine, I need to schedule one day off of it preferably the next day. For me, this is to keep me from falling back into a habit of total dependency. The shocking thing? I do not miss Celsius AT all, and I LOVE the taste of Celsius. But I am entirely turned off by it now that I know what affect it was having on me in so many areas of my life. Coffee seems to be much less harsh on me and I'm able to go days without having it, it feels more like a treat....whereas Celsius felt like a necessity. My next step is to switch entirely to decaf coffee even when I have coffee. 

  
So for you fellow energy drink consumers out there, please ditch them. I promise the results are 100% worth it if you stick with it. ",4,1761324334.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

I don't expect anyone to read this, I'm just typing it out to get it off my chest.

First of all I'm not an actual marriage counsellor and every single time one or both of them talk to me about their marital issues I've recommended that they speak to an actual professional marriage counsellor, but they still come to me on the reg.

I'm male, and for sake of simplicity I'm just going to refer to these people as M (husband) and F (wife).

I met them both when I started working at a new job where they're both working. I met F on my first day through one of the people who were training me as they were good friends outside of work. Meeting her was what I describe as a ""woah"" moment for me. I've had a couple of these throughout my life, where I meet someone new and the attraction is just instant, my brain kind of freezes and all I can say or think is ""woah"". 

We hit it off straight away, we have a lot in common both in terms of interest and attitude. It's going to sound stupid and immature but it's an important point to the story, but one of the things we bonded over is that we're both big weed smokers. During this first conversation she mentioned that her (at the time) fiancé also works there. At the time my mindset immediately switched to a kind of ""he's a very lucky guy, I'm happy for you both"" vibe and that initial feeling of attraction for her quickly petered out.

I didn't actually meet her fiancé until about 7 months later when I'd transferred to the same department as him. We also have a fair bit in common (mostly video games and sense of humor) and became fast friends. A couple of weeks later they invited me over to their house for a games night, which very quickly turned into a thing we do every single week.

Now this was first time that I have ever actually seen these two people together and it was *not* pretty. He kinda treated her like shit, talked down to her, minimised her feelings, and made a lot of jokes about foreign ethnicity which you could tell was upsetting for her. Ordinarily in this situation I'd go in with my feminist-ally guns a-blazing, but against my best judgement I held my tongue because I didn't want to make my work life any more difficult than it already was since I have to work with this guy.

A few months later they hit a big rocky patch, and they both invididually came to speak to me about their problems. From talking to them both (and honestly way before that) it was immediately clear that M's attitude was the main problem in their relationship. F did about 95% of work around the house despite the fact that they both work the same hours at the same place, while M spent most of his time gaming (a tale as old as about... 2003).

Now my advice to them has always been communication first. ""What you just said to me, you need to say to her/him because you two are just fumbling around in the dark at the moment."" But I always rounded it back to ""not a marriage counsellor, please speak to one"".

Things seemed better for a while, but then came to a head at the work Christmas party. M got very drunk despite not normally being a drinker, and must have spent a grand total of about 15 minutes with his wife throughout the whole party, so I basically ended up chaperoning her for the whole night, something that I was admittedly a little too happy to do.

We basically spent the entire evening, for lack of a better word, bitching about her husband. How he does nothing around the house, how he makes her feel small and insignificant because she likes to smoke a bit of weed (he can't stand the smell, fair enough) and that things just really weren't good in their marriage at the moment. Despite that I still feel we had a good night together, we snuck out for a joint and basically spent the whole party *away* from the party having a chat.

Work had arranged coaches to get people home, and F (who was pretty drunk at this point) had brought a bottle of wine with her and was dead excited about the fact. She grabbed a seat and I grabbed the one in front because obviously husband and wife are going to want to sit together when he eventually turns up. About 5 minutes later, F starts offering this bottle of wine to anyone and everyone getting on the coach, clearly decides she's had enough and doesn't want it. So I reached over the seat and said ""if you don't want it I'll hold it for you"" and... she just bit my hand. Not hard, like an affectionate nibble. I looked over the seat and her and she looked back with these big doe eyes and just slowly let go of my hand and said sorry. The next day I told our friend about this incident (the one who introduced us in the first place) and their response was ""oh shit, not good. Biting is like the number 1 sign of attraction / affection from her.""

Well, fuck.

Eventually M gets on the coach and the two of them don't really say much to each other, mostly just an ""are you okay? Yes, are you? Yes""

 I found out from them both the next day that they'd had a massive argument that night. She was upset that he'd abandoned her at the party, and he was upset that she was drunk and that she'd immediately left the house once they got home to go and smoke a joint. 

Shortly after M got himself into therapy and worked through a few of his own issues, but still no actual marriage counsellor. Things got better between them for a few months but then things inevitably came to a head again.

The main crux of this disagreement was children.

M is 100% deadset, absolutely certain that he is going to have children.

F is 100% deadset, absolutely certain that she is *not* going to have children. In her own words ""I want my shit scooped out ASAP"".

Now obviously to anyone reading this, that relationship is essentially doomed from the beginning. I only just learned this about them both, but apparently they've known that they disagree on ""kid problem"" since before they even got engaged. Neither of them are willing to compromise on this situation (rightfully so, compromising parents make fucked up children IMO).

So things have just been very shitty between them both for quite a while now, with major blowups once or twice a month, and usually I'm the one they come to talk to about it.

Fast forward a few months, and the group of friends that are involved in the weekly games night at M and F's place decide they want to go on a trip to Amsterdam. I immediately throw my hat in the ring for obvious reasons, as does F. And predictably M doesn't want to go since he despises the smell of weed. So we plan and book this trip, me, F and a 3 other people. A few weeks later M changes his mind and says he does want to go, but since we both do the exact same job at work we aren't allowed to take holidays at the same time.

So we go on our trip to Amsterdam and that's where my feelings for F really took off. We're the biggest smokers of the group we were with so we were together all the time, often splitting off from the rest of the gang to go and check out different coffee shops. Every single night ended with the 2 of us chain smoking joints on the balcony of the appartment we were in, talking about how much we loved the city and didn't want to leave. Sitting there with her, shooting (and smoking) the shit, was honestly the happiest I've been in a very long time, didn't want it to end. I want to clarify at this point that **nothing** sexual or romantic happened between us during this trip. Just my typical bullshit of developing feelings for someone I shouldn't have feelings for.

Well, I loved the trip so much that I decided I wanted to go back ASAP. I've never had an interest in solo travelling, but I just want back so badly that I'd go alone if I had to, but would rather go with friends. So I put out an open call to everyone I know ""I'm going to Dam on these dates, anyone is welcome to join, but I'm 100% going even if it's by myself"".

As you can probably guess, F is the only person who has said yes. So now we're going to a foreign country together without her husband, again. But this time its just the two of us... M says that he's okay with this (he was okay with the last trip) but this one is *obviously* different since its just the two of us.

And that finally brings round to the present. A couple of days ago M messaged me very much out-the-blue and just said ""I don't think me and F will still be married by the end of year."" Obviously helping them with their marital problems is really fucking tough for me considering the on-and-off feelings for F, but I've always tried to stay true to my convictions and be a helpful friend to them both. The absolute last thing I want is for them to divorce, my feelings for her come out, and then I get accused of intentionally trying to break them up for my own interest. Unfortunately, I've kind of fucked up in the opposite way...

He went on a long rant about how the two of them aren't compatible, how they have so little in common, that he feels the main reason they're still together is because it's the easier option since they live and work together. Now I know these people well enough to know that this simply is not going to work. They're fundamentally such different people with different fundamental values and ideals that I know their relationship will not work without one of them completely losing their individuality / identity. I'm usually the friend that tells it straight which is why people come to me with this stuff, but because I'm so afraid of the aforementioned scenario where I look like a manipulative asshole, I keep encouraging them to talk it out and try to work through their problems. If I didn't have feelings for F i would absolutely be encouraging both of them to start arranging a mutual divorce.

So yesterday they both sat down and had the big talk, and came to the conclusion that they're just gonna keep on trying to make it work. The conditions for a successful relationship that they themselves worked out are as follows:

M says that F needs to quit smoking weed and drinking in order to make the relationship work.

F says that M needs to accept and be okay with the fact that she occasionally likes to smoke weed and drink alcohol.

Yeah. Once again we're back to over-arching theme of their entire relationship - that their interests and values are incompatible, and that one or both of them will have to change some fundamental part of themselves in order to make it work, but they're both adamant that they won't be the one to change.

And here I am just stuck in the middle of all of it, not knowing what to say or what do anymore, not knowing how I'm supposed to find a positive outcome in this situation for myself. I have honestly have a very sacred view of relationships so I would never make any sort of move towards F while they're still together, but it just gets harder and harder to deal with every day. It gets harder to not pull them both aside and say ""look, just get a fucking divorce already"".

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

HELP! Nespresso CitiZ Platinum Stuck in Descaling Mode (Solid Orange Light)



Hey everyone, I'm at my wit's end with my machine and could really use some expert help from this community.

I have a Nespresso CitiZ Platinum (the model with the 5 buttons on top and no dedicated power button).

The Problem: The machine has a solid orange light and is completely stuck in descaling mode. It will not exit, i can brew coffee though 

What I've Done So Far:
I initiated a descaling cycle because the light was blinking orange.After running the descaling through, the light went solid. Now, no matter what I do, I can't get it to complete the cycle and reset.

Here is a list of everything I have already tried, all with a tank full of fresh water:

· Standard Reset: Held the Lungo button for 5+ seconds after the rinse cycle. This does NOT work—it just dispenses a shot of hot water and does not turn the orange light off.
· Full Hard Reset: Unplugged the machine from the wall for over 10 minutes to drain the capacitors. Plugged it back in and immediately opened/closed the lever. The orange light persists after this.


Has anyone with this specific 5-button, no-power-button CitiZ Platinum model encountered this? Is there a secret button sequence I'm missing? Or does this sound like a firmware glitch that requires a professional fix?

Any advice would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance.

I tried going to an http page and it did redirect me to the login page but then it said there was an error (I don't remember the code and I'm gone now). But it worked fine on my phone. 

So I'm just wondering if that's normal because every day at school I'll have to login to the wifi and I need this to work. Could it be a DNS thing? I switched it to cloudflare but haven't been to a public wifi yet to test it. Is it easy to switch to something other than iwd if that's the issue?

a few weeks ago, before college, we would see each other a few times a week, we'd text regularly and i was happy.

college started and it's like i'm single. i haven't seen him in 2 weeks, whenever i invited him out his excuses were ""i'm reading"" or ""i'm too tired after college.

additional info-i take driving classes, go to college, work a part time job and live an hour from the main city so i'm pretty fucking busy. the thing is i still make time for him and invite him out whenever i'm free. he doesn't have a job, doesnt drive and his only obligation is college. which JUST STARTED so we dont have any tests yet. i'm not trying to bash him, but all of that adds layers to my frustration with him.

i texted him my concerns because i'd text him and he would ghost me for 3-5 hours. he said sorry. the next day he did the same thing so i texted him again. he blew up on me and said some harsh things like ""sorry i cant come watch you work i have better things to do"" which really hurt me since i loved having him with me while on my job.

we fought and went out for coffee later, he apologised, said he really cares about me. i went from that coffee still feeling unhappy.

i decided to swallow my pride and ask him to meet again. i had a long day (woke up at 6 am for college, went to classes, had a pcr class for driving school) and i was so excited to see him. he then brought his random college friends and later invited more of his friends. i decided to just go home because i was too tired. i also noticed in those 20 minutes i got alone with him i didn't really have anything to say to him. i have a hard time pretending everything is fine when i'm sad, but we JUST got over the issue and i planned on apologising to him for not communicating better. him bringing others pissed me off again so i decided to just give up on that plan.

since then i'm initiating conversations and i'm feeling super confused. his actions show he doesn't care, but why is he still with me then? he got really mad at me when i said it seems like he isn't invested in our relationship. i'm on the verge of breaking up with him which makes me so sad. i don't know what to do, he's currently ignoring my texts again and i'm exausted.

i want to make this work but i feel like an idiot begging my boyfriend to want to see me. this is supposed to be our ""honeymoon stage"" but i'm feeling so sad almost every day, i don't have motivation for anything and when i do get a little free time i now spend it sulking and bedrotting. i don't know what to do.

TLDR my boyfriend isn't acting like one, i'm tired of begging for his attention and i don't know how to proceed because the last thing i want to do is break up.",0,1761323395.0,relationships,7,0.33,False

In her announcement, Roan wrote that The Midwest Princess Project will provide support and resources for transgender youths, as well as the LGBTQ+ community as a whole.

She added that she partnered with several LGBTQ+ groups during her latest tour and intends to donate additional money to at least six organizations, including several in New York City, Los Angeles and Missouri.

Mel Constantine Miseo is a board member at The Center Project, an LGBTQ+ community center based in Columbia and one of the intended recipients. They said it’s important that Roan is bringing awareness to Midwest community centers.

“I think it’s so awesome that she’s highlighting centers in the Midwest,” Constantine Miseo said. “There’s usually a lot of national attention toward centers on the coasts … but it’s also so needed here in the Midwest where we’re under political attack, where we don’t have as many resources to do, like, big things.”

The Center Project provides community resources, such as a basic needs pantry and a gender affirming closet, as well as opportunities for community gathering. Constantine Miseo said they host a queer youth group, a regular “Coffee with Queers” event, and a “Gender Blender” for trans and non-binary adults.

They said an influx of funding from organizations, such as The Midwest Princess Project, will allow the center to reach more people in mid-Missouri.

In 2023, Missouri passed a ban on gender-affirming healthcare for transgender minors, and Constantine Miseo said this has led to families driving to neighboring states for care and has negatively impacted the mental health of trans youths.

“Finding community is life-saving,” Constantine Miseo said. “To know that you’re not alone, to know that you don’t have to be hidden, that there are people who love you and support you and want to see you thrive and grow. That saves lives.”

Constantine Miseo said the funding from the Midwest Princess Project hasn’t come yet but could be used to hire an executive director and expand programming.

Aaron Schekorra is the executive director of the other Missouri organization Roan selected. The GLO Center is located in Springfield, Missouri — near Roan’s hometown of Willard.

He said they hope to use money from Roan’s Midwest Princess Project to start queer youth groups in the rural communities surrounding Springfield, such as West Plains, Miller, Branson, Joplin, Nevada and more.

“We feel that it’s our mission and our job and our obligation to reach out to those grassroots organizations,” Schekorra said. “(We want to) get into those spaces with them, figure out what it is that they need, how best we can support them to create something sustainable for their community.”

Schekorra said the majority of the GLO Center’s funding comes from private donations and local grants, which is why donations and awareness of the organization are both beneficial.

He said The Midwest Princess Project is especially exciting for the center because it isn’t just a one-time check but instead is creating the possibility of funding that is more “consistent and sustainable and long term.”

“Raising that awareness — like, it is hard to put into words the impact that her support has had, because it goes way beyond just that money,” Schekorra said. “It’s raising that awareness, having that conversation about the Midwest and about the queer culture and communities here in the Midwest.”

Schekorra said this is not the first gift Roan has made to the center. She donated $27,484 following several stops of her Midwest Princess tour last year.",57,1761323266.0,missouri,1,0.94,False

I will buy more and decrease my avg till I get as low as possible I suggest people with a high avg do the same as it will minimize your losses if we do go under which is unlikely because we’ve hit threshold and it’s holding steady

The only solid idea I have is the TV against the blank wall adjacent to the windows. Ideally I’d like to include a small space to eat/work, a couch, plants, coffee table, and potentially a desk space. 

And if I have visitors — the ability to maybe blow up an air mattress. 

Any ideas on how to best lay things out in this space? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! ☺️",1,1761323153.0,DesignMyRoom,1,0.67,False
