( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

(Please ignore my grammatical mistakes)

So, a few days ago I posted on reddit that ""I'm gonna quit writing for good"". But I couldn't doo that. I might've took help from chatgpt but I actually loved my story, characters and everything. That was my first story and I couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't just abandon it like this. 

So I decided to start from the basic again. But because I don't have anyone to discuss, I'm quite confused about so many parts. And I'm not going to chatgpt again, even for just discussing. So, I need help from real people. 

So if anyone here is intrested in discussing with me, just talking about writing, helping me write it, giving suggetions, passing time, chatting, or just making a random friend, please DM me here or on Instagram. 

Here's a part of my story I wrote, that'll give you an idea of what kind of personality my characters have. 


---

“Excuse me.”

A familiar voice came from behind him — low, steady. 

Noah almost dropped his cup.

Adrian stood there, dressed neatly as always, looking like he doesn't belong here. 

“You."" Noah looked up, almost relieved, but trying not to show it too much. 

Adrian’s lips quirked slightly. “Me.”

“You disappeared.”
“I was working.”
“For *three days*?”
“It happens.”

Noah squinted at him, unconvinced. Adrian looked… tired, somehow.Maybe he *was* working. 

“You could’ve said something,” Noah muttered, then instantly regretted it. It sounded too personal.

Adrian raised an eyebrow. “Would you have wanted me to?”

Noah stared into his coffee. “No. I mean—yes. I mean—shut up.”

A soft chuckle slipped from Adrian’s lips. It was quiet, genuine.

""You seemed lost.”

“I was *thinking*.”
“Dangerous habit.”

Noah’s lips twitched despite himself. He didn’t want to admit how relieved he felt seeing Adrian after three long days. He’d told himself it didn’t matter — but his mood had been strangely off since the last time they met.

Their conversation lingered between sarcasm and quiet comfort. Noah found himself talking more than usual — about college, his friends, and even a stray cat that had started following him home. Adrian listened, his responses short but attentive.

Noah reached for his sketchbook almost out of habit.

“I tried drawing you once,” he admitted, smiling shyly. “Didn’t work. You don’t stay still.”

Adrian leaned forward, eyes soft. “Try again.”

Noah blinked. “What?”

Adrian didn’t move back. His elbow rested on the table, head tilted slightly, that teasing glint in his eyes now replaced by something quieter — something that made Noah’s heartbeat skip.

The air felt heavier. Close.

Noah’s hand trembled slightly as he lifted the pencil. His focus wasn’t on the sketch anymore. It was on the way Adrian’s gaze held his, on how the space between them seemed to shrink without either of them meaning to.

Then the café door opened again. A couple came in laughing, shaking umbrellas, breaking the spell.

Adrian leaned back, exhaling softly. “You should finish that drawing.”

Noah smiled, cheeks flushed. “Maybe next time.”

1p2zimi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1p2zimi/another_formulation_of_the_logical_evil_problem/,Another formulation of the logical evil problem,"Why does Classical Theism have no God?

1)On the logical impossibility of the existence of libertarian free will (LFW)

(S1) You do what you do in any situation, the way you are.

(S2) In order to be ultimately responsible for what you do, you need to be ultimately responsible for the way you are, at least in some important mental respects.

(S3) But in no way can you be ultimately responsible for the way you are.

(S4) That is, you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.

Another formulation:

(S1) When I make the choice as a result of my desires, it seems like I have free will.

(S2) But I don't want my desires to be wanted, I don't want my desires to be wanted, I don't want my desires to be wanted, I don't want my desires to be wanted... need to.

(S3) In this case, either I am my own cause. So I'm not created. Or I have created myself out of absence. These 2 results are logically impossible.

p: God is the creator of everything.

q: God is not the creator of LFW.

Since p = -p, p \^ q = p \^ -p = 0.

2)Reformulating the logical evil problem

(S1a) God is completely good.

(S1b) God has infinitely high morality.

(S1c) God is infinitely powerful.

(S1d) God is infinitely knowledgeable.

(S2a) God gave the first factors to the universe.

(S2b) There is evil. (Religious texts, experiences...)

(S2c) God knew that the first factors would deterministically lead to evil.

(S2d) God could have prevented evil by changing the first factors. But he didn't prevent it.

(S3) (S1a,b,c,d)\^(S2a,b,c,d) = 0. Therefore, God does not exist.

3)Objections and replies to objections

3.1)The God is timeless argument

This argument doesn't change anything because the initial factors would deterministically change the universe.

3.2)God put LFW in the first factors and created the universe according to him, because he knew what we would do freely with his intermediate knowledge (molinism Let LFW(x) be, let x = final character;

LFW(a) = He would drink coffee freely at 9 o'clock. LFW(b) = He would not be able to drink coffee freely at 9 o'clock.

Even if God chooses LFW(a) here, this solution is still not valid. Because God is the one who grounds/chooses a.

If LFW(?) = a, then LFW(¿) = ? will be →. This goes on forever. Therefore, this defense is logically impossible. So, in order for me to drink that coffee freely at 9 o'clock, ∞ steps have to be taken. Or I have to be the first cause. Both of these are logically impossible.

3.3)Spiritual development defense

This is a weak argument. The evolutionary evil argument and the animal evil argument refute this. Also, according to most Theologies, animals do not have souls.

3.4)Skeptical Theism

This defense (S1a,b,c,d) makes my arguments ambiguous. That's why I don't think it would be the right choice. Such a God cannot be trusted.

3.5)Fideism (Revelation is superior to reason.)

This argument is also very weak. Because fideism will either lead to arbitrary religious exclusivism or religious pluralism. Arbitrary religious exclusivism is not a serious position. Religious pluralism is very weak. Because the normative moral rules of different religions contradict each other. If Buddhists say do not eat animals and Muslims say you can eat animals, there will be a conflict here.

3.6)The perpetrator's defense of causation

(S1) A perpetrator (A) ""chooses"" to perform action X at time t.

(S2) If A's choice of X is not due to A's previous states (his character, desires, beliefs) (which the Deceptive Causality claims), then there is no necessary connection between the choice of X and A's current state.

(S3) If there was no necessary connection, it was entirely possible for A to choose Y instead of X.

(S4) But why did X happen rather than Y, when all the conditions (inside and outside A) were the same?

(S5) The Pro-Agent Causality advocate says, ""Because the Agent wanted it that way.""

(S6) Rebuttal: This is not an explanation. The question ""Why did he want it that way?"" is asked again.

a) If there is a reason (because she liked X more), then we return to determinism (character).

b) If there is no reason, this choice is random (arbitrary).

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Last night, using the directions in the link as a base, I made my own applemoyse, tweaking a bit, omitting non-gastritis-friendly ingredients. It came out \*amazing\*. Even my mom, who doesn't have gastritis, couldn't get enough.

Original recipe based on recipe from the 1500s:

[https://www.lovebritishhistory.co.uk/2020/07/tudor-applemoyse.html?m=1](https://www.lovebritishhistory.co.uk/2020/07/tudor-applemoyse.html?m=1)

Here is my version:

You will need 3 apples, 2 egg yolks, a plant-based unflavored or vanilla coffee creamer you can tolerate, sugar, vanilla extract, stevia (optional), and cinnamon. Both brown and white sugar work. I used brown sugar.

Like the recipe, I used 3 apples. I peeled them and cut them into chunks, then brought them to a simmer in just enough water to cover the chunks. (The little bonus you get here is that after you've cooked your apples, you can pour the remaining water you cooked them in into a mug and drink it as an apple tea of sorts. It's sweet and delicious and tastes like a milder apple juice.) When the apple chunks are soft enough to mash, remove them from heat, transfer them to a mixing bowl, and mash them as smooth as you can. After mashing, I took the water out of my pot, put the mashed apples back in with the heat on, stirred in TWO egg yolkes, and added about 2 tablespoons of sugar and a few splashes of almond and coconut based coffee creamer​ (not too much now). Once the egg yolks are in, you need be stirring constantly, so if it's easier you can add these ingredients in when it's off the heat right after mashing. Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is nice and fluffy. Once you turn the heat off, stir in vanilla extract, maybe about a teaspoon. (The vanilla takes the place of the rosewater in the original recipe.) The recipe calls for sprinkling cinnamon \*and\* ginger over the top before serving, but I only used cinnamon. If you like it a bit sweeter, you can stir a little stevia into your own individual serving.

And a note: Don't worry about the egg yolks not being cooked enough. The heat from the mashed apples cooks them instantly. (You'll see them go from that darker, raw orangey yellow to a light, creamy yellow as soon as you stir them in.)",2,1763733778.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

1p2zeym,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1p2zeym/all_you_need_to_know_about_saber_to_use_it/,All You Need to Know About “Saber” to Use It Correctly,"“Saber” is one of the most common and essential Spanish verbs, but it’s not as simple as it may seem at first glance. You can’t just translate it as “to know” in English, it has specific uses and nuances, which I explain below. Learn these few rules and you’ll stop making mistakes when using this verb.

1 . SABER vs PODER

Basic idea

* SABER + infinitivo = to know how to do something (a learned skill).
* PODER + infinitivo = to be able / can because of permission, circumstances or current ability.

If in English you mean “know how to…”, use SABER, not PODER.

* Sé conducir. → I can drive / I know how to drive.
* No sé bailar salsa. → I can’t dance salsa (I don’t know how).
* Mi hermano sabe dibujar muy bien. → My brother can draw very well.

And *poder*, for example, is used in cases like these:

* Podemos quedar mañana si quieres. → We can meet tomorrow if you want.
* Hoy no puedo nadar, estoy enfermo. → I can’t swim today, I’m sick.
* ¿Puedo sentarme aquí? → Can I sit here?

❗ Important contrast

* No sé conducir. → I don’t know how to drive. (I never learned.)
* Sé conducir, pero ahora no puedo porque he bebido.→ I know how to drive, but right now I can’t because I’ve been drinking.

2 . SABER vs CONOCER 

 Basic idea

* SABER = to know information, facts or how to do something. Often goes with que, dónde, cuándo, quién, si…
* CONOCER = to be familiar with people, places or things (books, films, cities…). Use a before a person.

SABER in context:

* Sé que mañana no hay clase. → I know there’s no class tomorrow.
* No sé dónde está la estación. → I don’t know where the station is.
* ¿Sabes si el supermercado está abierto? → Do you know if the supermarket is open?

CONOCER in context:

* Conozco a tu hermana. → I know your sister.
* No conozco este barrio. → I don’t know / I’m not familiar with this neighbourhood.
* ¿Conoces esta serie? → Do you know / Have you seen this series?

3 . Saber**se** algo

Saber can also be used with the particle *“*se*”*, which makes it pronominal and slightly changes its meaning. In this form, it means to know something by heart.

* Me sé esta canción de memoria. → I know this song by heart.
* Me sé todas las capitales de Europa. → I know all the capitals of Europe (by heart).

4 . SABER “A” = to taste like 

In this structure, saber has nothing to do with “to know.” It’s used to talk about the flavor of food or drink.

* Tu pastel sabe a limón. → Your cake tastes like lemon.
* El café sabe a quemado. → The coffee tastes burnt.

Not even sure if the process of how it works is relevant or not, but I deleted my paragraph explaining it so I don't break sub rules, so if the details are important of how it works, and would help you guys help me get decent at sales, feel free to ask. 

NOW. I am NOT a avid phone caller, I ignore 99% of calls I get unless it's one of three people lmao, planning to work on this and grow some balls in order to speak with clients I gain interest from.

So, what advice would you give me to help land these sales. What would be the best method to use and how should I speak to someone, I don't know?

I have even started talking to myself, as if I am speaking to a potential client on the phone, trying to get them on board lmfaooo

Maybe something I should do prior, in the cold outreach stage? Should I try and gather as much info on these potential clients as possible?

My current idea, it to make them feel important (""I know you're a busy guy/woman, so I'll make this quick"") - (""Did you manage to check out the agent"") - sell them on time they could save (""So it will handle all the appointment booking, so you can enjoy that coffee or lunch break without people calling you asking for an appointment"") - (""Even booking appointments past closing hours, so you can relax abit more while you're at home"") 

Maybe ask some questions for yes answers, like (""Do calls bother you much while you're trying to chill out"") - (""Do you sometimes miss or lose clients cause you just can't pick up the phone""

When starting new classes, remember that your outlook on this school year can impact your performance all year. It’s much easier to earn an A if you do your best from the start instead of falling behind during the first few weeks and playing catch up the rest of the semester. Mentally prepare yourself to put your best foot forward in the first half of the semester. Try to stay ahead as long as you can. You may be surprised by how far you’ll go. 

# Create a Daily Routine and Stick to It

  
Put a finger down if you’ve ever woken up less than 15 minutes before heading out the door, leaving little to no time for getting ready, gathering your things, or eating breakfast. Put another finger down if you’ve ever been tardy. We get it. Sometimes, the alarm doesn’t go off. But have you ever noticed that the anxiety of being late or forgetting your homework can derail your entire day? Developing a daily routine will keep you refreshed and focused as you tackle your course load.   
  
This routine will vary depending on your grade level, school, extracurriculars, and any other commitments you have throughout the day (such as a part-time job). A few general tips for creating a daily routine: Set a designated time to wake up, get dressed, and eat breakfast. Follow your class schedule during the day, attending every class and activity.   
  
Remain committed to your extracurriculars, but understand there are limitations to what you can take on in one day. Avoid overloading yourself; communicate with your coach or program director if conflicts arise. Plan the evening to work on homework, projects, test prep, or college applications. Set a designated bedtime to ensure you get plenty of sleep each night. This may seem like common sense, but developing a routine that works for you is an art! Getting into the groove may take some time, but adding structure to your day can help. 

# Make a To-Do List

  
We recommend setting goals for each day, month, and year. This to-do list may include homework, chores, healthy habits, test prep, creative projects, goals, or other items you plan to accomplish during a specific time frame. Research shows that you are 42 percent more likely to achieve your goals when you write them down.   
  
Start by writing down your daily plans, and see if it helps boost your productivity. Some of our students successfully developed their school planners using the Bullet Journal method. The Bullet Journal is a creative notebook organization system to help you stay on track and better measure your daily successes. It’s also a lot of fun! 

#  Keep Track of More Than Just Homework Deadlines

  
As a high school student, you have a lot on your mind. That’s why we recommend you write down your deadlines in one place. In addition to homework due dates, your school planner should include your test prep schedule, upcoming test dates, extracurricular activities, and scholarship and college application deadlines (if you’re a senior). Try writing things down, and if that doesn’t work for you, explore free digital planning tools like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Trello, or other popular tools. 

#  Create a Comfortable, Distraction-Free Study Space

  
Rummaging through a cluttered desk or overhearing family members talking can easily break your focus. Find a quiet, clean space within your home to sit while studying or working on homework. If complete silence is hard to find, use headphones to drown out any background noise. If you lose focus quickly, keep all distractions “out of sight and out of mind.” This may involve placing your gaming console in a drawer, keeping pets in another room, or temporarily shutting off notifications for social media apps.   
  
Another tip is to make sure you are comfortable. Avoid sitting on the couch or in bed, as this may cause you to become sleepy or hold your body in uncomfortable and awkward positions. We recommend sitting at a desk or your kitchen table. Grab a comfortable chair with adequate back and neck support to avoid discomfort. Explore other options if all else fails and you can’t focus in your room. Coffee shops, libraries, and empty fast-food restaurants with free WiFi can also serve as study spaces. 

#  Communicate Your Schedule with Family and Friends

  
Spending time and making memories with your people is essential, especially since the high school years are so fast! But it shouldn’t take away from time spent working toward your college goals. Most of the time, your loved ones will understand if you have to focus on your homework before you can hang out. We recommend sharing your schedule with your friends and family.   
  
They can help plan around your priorities and support you when you’re overloaded with tasks. However, it helps to be considerate—your parents are busy too! Keep them happy by learning how to prioritize needs at home alongside your school schedule. Try looking at it this way: good time management is an important life skill you will need in college. 

#  Take Breaks

  
For some students, studying takes work. Sometimes, we need more focus, even when we carve time out of our day for it. If this sounds like you, try to trick your mind by pairing this not-so-fun task with something you enjoy. For every hour or so you spend working on a task, give yourself a little break to do things you love.   
  
For example, if you spend an hour studying for an upcoming math test, give yourself a pat on the back by enjoying your favorite snack, taking a short walk, or watching an episode of your favorite show. Breaking up your study time will prevent brain drain and help you avoid procrastination. But for this to work correctly, you must intentionally manage your breaks and ensure the task merits the reward. For instance, one hour of studying shouldn’t result in four hours of TV. 

#  Stay Engaged by Participating and Asking Questions

  
Attending classes day in and day out can be challenging for staying engaged. Writing your notes can help you follow along and remain alert throughout class. And don’t be afraid to speak up! Answering your teacher’s questions will help you retain what you’re learning, identify areas you need to spend more time on and support your teacher and classmates in remembering you.   
  
It’s a lot easier to get an extension on a research paper or find partners for group projects if I’ve been present and participated throughout the class. Remember, the more interactions I’ve had with a teacher, the more likely they’ll be willing to write me a letter of recommendation for my college applications. 

#  Ask for Help

  
Another benefit of getting to know your teachers is that I can go to them when I have trouble understanding a concept or need more direction on a school project or essay. If I’m struggling, don’t be afraid to ask for help! If you can’t catch them after class, send an email, see them before or after school, or schedule a time for you to work on a problem one-on-one.   
  
Remember, the sooner you ask for help, the better. If I recognize that I’m starting to fall behind early in the semester, there’s a better chance of catching up before the midterms or finals. Your teachers are experts in the subject and support you throughout your learning. Often, they’ll have a better grasp on the content than a parent who hasn’t touched trigonometry or calculus in over 20 years (but let’s give a shoutout to all the amazing moms and dads out there trying to brush up on complex subjects to help—we know it’s tough not always having the answers). 

#  Try to Socialize Every Day

  
A high school education should extend beyond academics. Knowing how to socialize and interact with others is an important skill many colleges and employers look for in applicants. Remember to try to communicate with your friends regularly or look for ways to make new friends. School clubs are a great place to start! 

#  Stay Involved

  
How you spend time outside school is essential to your college application. Many sports and student organizations, like debate or drama clubs, look for new participants yearly. Our best advice here is not to be afraid to try something new! However, be mindful of your ability to juggle multiple commitments. It’s okay to try many new extracurriculars during your freshman year of high school. Remember that as your courses become more challenging, the time will come to decide which ones you like best. 

#  Plan Ahead for the SAT®, ACT®, or PSAT Tests

  
While some colleges will not require a test score when submitting applications for general admission, the vast majority will still look at them when reviewing college applications. Several prominent colleges have returned to test-required admissions.   
  
Even if a college is test-optional for general admission, it may still require test scores for many of the more selective aspects of the admissions process, such as scholarships, in-state tuition, honors college placement, or admission to a competitive degree program.   
  
Since test scores will continue to play a significant role in college admissions, it’s essential to plan when registering for upcoming tests. At KD, we offer prep courses for the PSAT, SAT®, and ACT® tests to help students reach their college goals. 

#  Use Your Time Wisely

  
As mentioned, time management is an important life skill that impacts high school and college performance. During these formative years, small acts like learning how to show up on time or planning so you can follow through with your commitments will give you the discipline necessary to achieve goals throughout your life.   
  
Productivity can also happen in your free time. Learning a new skill, practicing a dance routine, exercising, working on arts and crafts, or taking a free online course are all productive ways to spend a weekend afternoon. Small activities like these can also help you find peace and positivity. 

#  Find Healthy Ways to Manage Stress

  
The high school years are stressful. In a 2014 study by the American Psychological Association, teens, on average, reported that their stress level during the school year far exceeds what they believe to be healthy. In 2020, the same organization reported that nearly half of teenagers said COVID-19 made them feel like it’s impossible to plan for the future. If you’re experiencing high stress levels, maybe it’s time to step back, take a deep breath, and evaluate your feelings. We all strive to be happy, but sometimes, that goal remains outside our grasp.  
  
For tips on better managing stress, check out our post “How to Be Happy Anywhere (Even School),” written by a former KD student. Sometimes, stress becomes more than we can handle on our own. There’s no shame in seeking help. If you need help and don’t know where else to go, start by taking advantage of these free mental health resources for teenagers. 

#  Explore Potential Majors and Career Paths

  
It seems unfair to force students to decide what they’ll do for the rest of their lives when there’s still so much to learn about the world. However, the college and job system rewards students who have matured enough to make this decision at 17 or 18. For example, competitive degree programs and career-specific scholarships want to know that you’ve decided on a college major.   
  
This choice becomes more manageable if you’ve dedicated time to trying new things and pursuing particular middle and high school interests. Some students know from a young age. Others must find inspiration through extracurriculars, contests, or a passionate teacher with a contagious appreciation for a particular subject.",1,1763733488.0,College_News,0,1.0,False

It keeps workers awake, focused, and ready to do their best. Today, most workplaces run fast. People join meetings, complete tasks, and handle deadlines. A strong espresso helps them stay active. That is why offices need a reliable, fast, and easy-to-use espresso machine.

This article explains everything in a simple way, without hard words. It will help you choose the best espresso machine for your office by looking at real data, expert opinions, and practical experiences.

The article includes four big sections:

1. How Coffee Supports Productivity and Office Energy
2. Key Features Every Office Espresso Machine Should Have
3. Best Machine Categories for Offices With Pros, Cons, and Data
4. Real Office Feedback, Expert Tips, and Easy Buying Recommendations

# SECTION 1: HOW COFFEE SUPPORTS PRODUCTIVITY AND OFFICE ENERGY

Coffee is more than a morning habit. It is a helpful tool that pushes people to stay alert, think clearly, and focus on work. Offices with a good espresso machine see happier, more energetic teams.

# 1. Coffee Makes Work Faster

Research shows that office workers who drink coffee complete tasks up to 12 to 20 percent faster. A cup of espresso wakes the brain and improves reaction time. When workers can get coffee quickly inside the office, they save time and start working sooner.

# 2. Coffee Improves Team Morale

A shared espresso machine becomes a small meeting point inside the office. Workers gather, talk, share ideas, and relax for a minute. These small moments help build stronger teamwork.

# 3. Coffee Saves Time and Money

Most people buy coffee from shops. That means waiting in long lines. One study found that workers spend more than 15 to 25 minutes daily getting coffee outside. An office machine reduces that time to under 1 minute.

Here is a simple cost comparison:

* Cafe espresso: 3 to 5 dollars
* Office-made espresso: around 0.40 to 0.50 dollars

If 25 people drink one cup a day, the office saves more than 1,600 dollars every month.

# 4. Coffee Helps With Afternoon Tiredness

Many workers feel sleepy after lunch. A shot of espresso gives quick energy without sugary drinks. Forty percent of workers say afternoon coffee helps them stay productive.

# SECTION 2: KEY FEATURES EVERY OFFICE ESPRESSO MACHINE SHOULD HAVE

Not all espresso machines are right for offices. Some are too small. Some are too slow. Some need too much cleaning. A workplace needs a machine that works fast and stays strong.

Below are the most important features explained in simple words.

# 1. Fast Brewing Time

Offices need a machine that makes espresso in less than 30 seconds. Slow machines cause long lines and wasted time.

# 2. Big Water Tank

A good office machine should have at least a 2-liter water tank. This reduces refill time and supports many cups throughout the day.

# 3. Easy, One-Touch Controls

Most offices do not want complicated buttons. A one-touch system makes it easy for everyone, even new employees. Anyone can get espresso instantly.

# 4. Strong Grinder and High-Quality Build

Machines with a steel grinder and metal housing last longer. Office machines run many times a day, so durability is important.

# 5. Quiet Operation

A noisy machine disrupts meetings or open-office spaces. Offices should pick machines that brew quietly.

# 6. Automatic Cleaning System

Offices need easy maintenance. Many machines rinse themselves automatically. This keeps the taste fresh and saves cleaning time.

# OFFICE ESPRESSO MUST-HAVE CHECKLIST

This section brings real user stories, expert opinions, and clear guidance.

# 1. Real User Office Experiences

# Story 1

A customer service office with 45 employees installed a super-automatic machine. Before that, workers spent long minutes waiting for coffee outside. After installing the machine, the morning rush reduced. Managers noticed faster login times and fewer late starts.

# Story 2

A small consulting office with 6 people used a pod machine. They liked how clean and simple it was. They said the machine kept their small space neat and made coffee breaks shorter.

# Story 3

A creative studio used a semi-automatic machine. Workers enjoyed making espresso with their own style. It improved mood and creativity, but during very busy days, the slower speed caused small delays.

# 2. Expert Advice in Easy Words

Coffee experts share these simple tips:

* The machine must match the number of workers.
* Automatic machines are the safest choice for most offices.
* Regular cleaning keeps the taste fresh.
* Always use clean, filtered water.
* Offices should avoid very small, low-power machines.
* Machines with built-in grinders make fresher espresso.

Experts also say that offices waste money when they buy a machine that is too small for their coffee demand.

# 3. Simple Buying Guide for Offices

This buying guide uses simple steps that anyone can follow.

# Step 1: Count how many people drink coffee

* 1 to 10 staff: Pod or small automatic

I didn’t kill Elise.

Yes, she died in my apartment.

Yes, I was by her side as her heart turned cold.

But God, no - I didn’t kill her.

It *may* look like we were alone, like no one broke in, but it’s a cruel trick. My fingerprints *may* be the only ones that were found on her body, but they didn’t need to lift a single finger to bleed her out.

So, I implore you - same as I’ve implored countless others - don’t write me off because it’s easy. Don’t send me upriver for the rest of my life because it’s convenient. 

Read what I have to say. Then, consider the blood.

Because the truth is in the blood.

Both mine *and* hers.

\- - - - - 

*That night, I heard her knocking at seven on the dot…*

I sit down the silverware I’d been unpacking, wipe a thick film of sweat from my forehead with the collar of my already drenched T-shirt, and walk to answer it. I must have been wearing my surprise like a pair of oversized novelty glasses, because the first thing out of her lips when she sees me is: 

*“You forgot about movie night, didn’t you?”*

I consider fibbing, but think better of it.

*“Sure did.”* 

Bowing as if in the presence of royalty, I hold the door open for her, gesturing inside my war zone of an apartment. A wolfish smirk creeps across her lips. She walks in, gives me a good-natured pat on the head, and tosses a family-sized bag of white cheddar popcorn onto my black leather sofa. A waft of perfume-soaked air whispers to me as she passes by; it smells of citrus and sea spray.

*“You’re a fortunate man, Mateo.”*

I nod. As the door’s deadbolt clicks into the lock, I find myself disagreeing with her. I've never felt like I've had much luck at all. I keep the sentiment internal.

She smells too nice to argue.

As we have sex, the wrathful Florida sun mercifully sets under the horizon, though that did little to cool us and the apartment, even after we were done.

Earlier that week, I’d begun moving into the townhome’s lower level, and - just my luck - the unit’s air conditioning wouldn’t turn on. I wasn’t entirely shocked. The row of newly constructed houses on the isolated strip of land looked like a rush job. Some were still only half-built, for God’s sake.

Far as I could tell, I was the only person living there, too.

There wasn’t a great alternative for cooling the apartment. Mitigating the boiling summer heat with dollar store plug-in fans, as the landlord had so graciously suggested before hanging up on me, was a *very* funny joke. 

Wasn’t keen on keeping the windows open either. 

Behind the house, a two-minute walk down a steep, overgrown hill, sequestered behind a rusty fence, there’s an abandoned reservoir. It’s the literal definition of a cesspool. A tub the size of a battleship filled to the brim with stagnant water, which of course meant it was a breeding ground for insects. The one time I cracked a window, a downright biblical swarm laid siege to my apartment within the hour. 

To keep out pests, I learned I had to maintain a tight perimeter.

I pull some fresh clothes from an open box in my bedroom. When I return, I apologize profusely for the stuffiness. Elise smiles. Dimples crest up her cheek like a stone skipping across the surface of a lake. She dismisses the apology with a wave of the hand, never one to pollute a quiet moment by dwelling on the unchangeable.

I loved that about her.

A few minutes later, we finally settle onto the couch. She opens the bag of popcorn. I pop on a movie. 

Whether out of grief, or longing, or some misplaced sense of responsibility for what happened, I replay the events of that night in my head every day, on an endless loop, over and over again until I start to feel physically sick. 

Every window was shut. The door was locked. I’m sure of it.

I have to be sure of it.

\- - - - - 

We’re reclining next to each other on the couch. It’s too hot to cuddle, but we’re still holding hands. Our feet are propped up on the coffee table.

It’s not perfect, but it’s damn close.

Exhaustion sets in. The move has been tiring. I’m fading in and out of sleep. The pearly light of the TV glitters against my tired eyes. All of a sudden, my body feels simultaneously hot and icy; a halfway point between being feverish and being drunk. 

I don’t mind the feeling. It’s not unpleasant; it’s just strange.

There’s this *whooshing* sound. It’s right next to my ear, but I can’t place what’s making it. The sound reminds of my baby sister using her asthma inhaler - sharp, breathy gulps - but it’s much, much quieter, barely audible.

My head leans back. We haven’t touched the remote for hours, so the TV clicks itself off.

I drift through a long, dreamless sleep. A cozy sort of paralysis.

Slivers of golden light needle my closed eyelids.

It’s morning. I start to stir.

I feel her hand before I see her. Woozy, vision focusing, I sort of think I’m feeling the couch: a palmful of cold, stiff leather.

But there are fingernails.

I turn to look at Elise.

Inches away, a pair of soulless, moon-tinted eyes stare back at me. Wilted skin wraps tightly around her skull. Makes the angles of her cheekbones look like two trapped elbows desperately trying to break free. Her craggy, shriveled lips are slightly pursed. There’s a slit across the side of her neck. Its pale edges are serrated and dainty: death-colored petals of a carnation blooming along the bank of the River Styx.

I stare back at her and wait patiently for this macabre dream to end.

My body is in the moment, reactive: heart galloping, breathing shallow, sweat torrential. My mind is anywhere *but* the moment: numb, emotionless, and nearly blank, save for one question:

*Where did all her blood go?*

It’s clearly not in her. It’s not on her, not even around the slit in her neck. I scan my apartment - the couch, the floor, the walls - it's all spotless. So, where the hell else could it be?

I review that damning peculiarity until, finally, my mind catches up.

This is no dream.

Then, the brain-splitting panic sets in.

I don’t have dreamless nights anymore. 

Now, every night, I dream of a ghost-white, bloodless Elise, lips pursed, perpetually about to speak.

But I always wake up before I hear what she wants to say.

\- - - - - 

My mind catalogued the day that followed into short, fragmented memories. A stack of blurry polaroids shuffled out of chronological order, but the story they tell always ends at the police station.

I’m sitting at a wobbly steel table across from Detective Frank. He’s quickly proven himself to be a real bastard, so when he demands that I address him by his last name, I make sure to call him Frank.

He has a small head on a narrow neck leading down to a monstrous, pulpy gut. His body is shaped like a tube sock stuffed with ground beef being held in the air, fabric sagging into a mushy ball as gravity fights to claim the meat. Either Frank or the interrogation room stinks of piss. No reason it couldn’t be both, I think.

He insists on asking me the same three questions:

*“Why’d ya kill her?”*

*“Where’d ya hide the knife?”*

and

*“Do you really see y’self gettin’ away with this?”*

By the time I’m being berated by Frank, I’m done earnestly pleading my innocence. Initially, I’d been appealing my case, saying things to dead-eyed police officers like: 

*“Why would I call it in if I was the one who hurt her?”*

or

*“I loved Elise.”*

or even

*“There should have been so much blood - where was all her blood?”*

No one believes me, though. No one has even *pretended* to believe me to save face. In a bitter, painful way, I’m not entirely surprised: a white girl was found dead in my apartment. Even if the mechanics of her death beggar belief, it doesn’t matter - I’ve been convicted by circumstance. Might as well have put a shotgun to her head in the middle of Times Square and pulled the trigger.

Eventually, Frank gets bored and starts to play dirty.

*“Would you say you have a history of violent behavior, Mateo?”* He doesn’t smile, but there’s an impish lilt in his voice. Frank is pleased because he knows it’s a trick question.

*“I didn’t hurt Elise.”* I mutter, bleary eyes fixed on a small crack in the table.

There’s a pause. My heart thumps indecipherable code against the back of my throat. All of a sudden, he shoots up from his chair like a puppet sprung from a jack-in-the-box and repeats the question with righteous zeal.

*“Would you say you have a history of violent behavior -* ***yes*** *or* ***no****?”*

Still, I don’t respond. I have no winning answer.

*“If you asked me…”* he starts, now smiling, *“…I’d say yes. Nearly blindin’ a poor young man with a broken beer bottle sounds pretty violent.”*

He wants me to bite, but I stay silent, gaze fixed on the crack in the table, dread bloating in my gut as I imagine all the ways it could have gotten there.

There’s a knock. 

I look up long enough to catch Frank’s dismay. His jaw is clenched tight enough to chip a tooth. He’s staring daggers at the steel door, but the person on the other side doesn’t wait for him to become civil; she enters.

Surprisingly, I recognize her. I’ve seen her interviewed on the news plenty, usually on the steps of the courthouse.

The woman is tall and slender. She has brittle, ancient-looking gray hair, but her porcelain skin is smooth, youthful, and confusingly wrinkleless. Her brown eyes are hard as stone. Her expression betrays confidence. The clunky, navy-colored vest strapped over her well-pressed Italian suit is the only piece of her that lacks poise, but the item is clearly one of necessity, not of choice. It’s gently vibrating against her chest. Plastic tubing connects the vest to a lunchbox-shaped machine resting atop a rolling metal cart behind her. A young man with tense, overly-slicked hair is standing beside the cart. I assume correctly that he’s an underling who’s been assigned the inglorious task of driving it. 

Her name is Danica. She’s a hotshot lawyer with an undisclosed lung disease - hence the vest. It vibrates to break up mucus or something. I have no idea what she’s doing in my interrogation room.

I didn’t call her, and whatever she costs, I certainly couldn’t afford her.

*“Same shit, different day - isn't that right, Frank?”* she booms.

He straightens his spine and sputters a few embarrassing half-words, none of which are worth mentioning.

*“Has this man even been to the hospital yet, Frank? I mean, for the love of God, he’s clearly injured.”*

She points a long, unpolished finger at my neck. I tilt my chin down to look to where she’s gesturing. To my profound bewilderment, she’s right: if I really crane my eyes, I can see the jagged corner of a cut peeking out from under my shirt collar. There’s a splotch of dried blood the size of a quarter next to the lip of it. I lift my hand and run a fingertip over the edges, feeling the laceration snake over my shoulder.

The area around the cut is swollen - absolutely ripe with trapped fluid - but it doesn’t hurt. Even when I press a trembling fingertip into the slit, feeling it plunge beneath my skin, so deep that I can appreciate the hot, spongy muscle lying at the bottom, all I sense is a dull pressure. Despite being open, the wound is dry. The sticky moisture of blood is completely absent. It's like the entire thing has been both anesthetized and clotted over.

How is *any* of that possible?

Before I can get too wrapped up in the question, Danica motions for me to follow her. I do as I’m instructed. I can feel Frank’s eyes crawling over my body as the door slams shut.

The hallway is buzzing with activity. My eyes squint against the phosphorescent bulbs overhead, which are blinding compared to the dim light of the interrogation room. The lawyer looms motionless in front of me, statuesque, her mechanical vest quietly pulsing.

*“I’ll be taking your case pro bono - do you understand what that means?”*

I nod slowly, though I’m not confused by the legalese; I’m confused why she’s representing me free of charge in the first place.

*“Great.”* She snaps her fingers. Her intern - an overeager twenty-something I’d later find out is named Tim - hands me her card.

*“First and foremost, get that cut checked out at the ER. Tim will call you tomorrow to set up a meeting. Do you have anywhere else to stay other than your apartment?”*

I do, but I lie.

*“No.”*

Her gaze narrows. She looks disappointed. Without another word, Danica turns and walks away.

I watch as she strides down the corridor, weaving herself through the crowd, nimble and elegant, never losing her pace.

All the while, Tim and her artificial tail struggle to keep up.

\- - - - - 

I sleep through most of the wait at the emergency room. 

I’m nudged awake by a nurse with a kind voice. I sit up straight, grimacing as I stretch. My neck is stiff. It aches from the awkward rest, body curled into a chair, head draped over its cushioned handle. In comparison, the deep, muscle-exposing gash in my shoulder still feels fine. No pain at all, and it’s barely bleeding. A few drops here and there. Nothing more.

I’m led by the nurse into an exam room that smells of days-old coffee and fresh bile. As I lower myself onto a hospital bed, a gruff physician with meteor-sized bags under his eyes stomps in after her. He inspects the wound with the tenderness of an MMA fighter, yanking and pulling the edges, out then in, lips open then closed, like he’s pretending to make it speak. I’m glad I can hardly feel it.

*“How the hell did you get cut like this?”* he barks into my ear.

I fabricate a story. Something about a construction accident. He grunts.

He draws a few blood tests to confirm I’m not in need of blood from the injury, which feels ass-backwards, taking blood to decide if I need *more* blood, but I don’t complain. Then, he sews the wound shut, and stomps off to see some other patients while the labs are cooking. I lay back on the hospital bed and try to relax.

While he’s gone, I think about the cut. 

Elise had an identically shaped cut across her neck. I figure it can’t be a coincidence, but that begs the question - why am I still alive? Why wasn’t I drained like she was?

As I consider the possible answers, misery digs its roots in deep. The chaos of being implicated in her murder led me to barricade my emotions in an act of self-preservation. Now, with the threat somewhat managed, that barricade was melting down.

Tears well. My chest feels tight. I’m scared, and I’m angry, and, God, I just don’t understand.

As if to comfort me, Elise materializes in my mind. Her bouncy, cocoa-colored curls. Her glacier-blue eyes. Her world-soothing smile.

The image flickers. Fades.

Then, all I can picture is her waxy, soot-tinted face and her soulless eyes; a pair of white grapes wilted to the size of raisins.

Dead Elise won’t leave, and I can’t get her to go.

Panic drips down my spine.

I leap up from the hospital bed and throw the sliding doors open. I hear the physician behind me. He’s attempting to flag me down. Something about my blood is off, he says. More tests are pending.

I’m not listening, and I don’t slow down.

Before long, I’m in an Uber, head leaning against the warm glass of the passenger side window, watching Miami dissolve on the horizon. When I step out of the car, the wrathful Florida sun is starting to set once again.

And there’s a humming in the air.

\- - - - - 

The evening devolves into an alcohol-fueled daze. 

I’m in my bedroom, slumped over my desk, head down. I lift the bottle from the floor and take a lazy sip. Whiskey burns a numb pleasure in the pit of my stomach.

I’m listlessly staring out the window that faces the hill behind my house. I can’t see the reservoir through the blackness, but I know it’s there. My neck feels tight and frozen, like someone is tenderly strangling me with an icepack, but my torso feels warm and full. There’s a gentle *whooshing* right next to my ear. None of this bothers me in the moment, not even when a human-shaped silhouette drifts into view outside the window, wearing the night like a shroud.

I squint, but I can’t make out their features. It’s just a blurry head with broad shoulders atop an unnaturally slender torso. The figure drifts closer. A rapid thrumming overwrites the *whooshing*. It sounds like the beating of helicopter blades.

Because of the sharp decline, it’s a fifteen-foot drop from that window to the ground.

How could anyone be standing there, and, more importantly,

where did Elise’s blood go?

\- - - - - 

I wake up gasping and terrified. 

I fall off the chair. My ass hits the floor with a painful *thump.* The half-empty whiskey bottle tips over in the commotion, clattering against the hardwood, spilling its copper contents into a small, sticky puddle.

It’s morning. No specter of death hovering outside my window - just harsh sunlight.

A groan mixed with a sigh billows from my lips. I’m about to get myself upright when I notice something odd. 

There’s a slight wetness beneath my shirt, but it’s not on the correct side. My healing cut is on the right shoulder, not the left, and it’s bandaged - it shouldn’t be leaking *anything*. 

I rip off the shirt, jump upright, and sprint to the bathroom.

When I flick on the light, there it is: 

another identical cut. 

A mirror image of the older one hidden under the white bandage.

It doesn’t hurt.

It’s barely bleeding.

And for some inexplicable reason, unlike Elise,

I remain unfortunately alive. 

\- - - - - 

Honestly, I expected Danica’s office to match her character. Lavish. Larger than life. A corner office at the apex of some monolithic skyscraper. In reality, the space is little more than a broom closet with a filing cabinet in the courthouse's basement. Tim has to wait in the hall to make room for me.

Her desk is cluttered with used coffee cups and haphazard stacks of jaundiced legal paper. She leans forward and asks me to recount the events of that night. Her gaze is intense. Minutes turn to hours, and she never seems to blink.

At first, I’m reluctant. I know the story sounds unhinged; I can hardly believe it myself. Danica was different, though. She didn’t sneer. She didn’t roll her eyes. Even when I show her the second cut, she remains neutrally attentive. It’s an incredible breath of fresh air.

*“Do you believe me?”* I ask.

*“That’s not really the point,”* she quips. There’s a pause. The soft buzzing of her vest fills the silence. After what felt like days of unbroken eye contact, her gaze floats away from me.

*“But I do, yes.”*

I watch the words stumble over her tongue; each syllable is slow and drawn out. Bathed in the piercing glow of the ceiling bulbs, her porcelain skin almost appears to gleam. It’s not as perfectly smooth as I first thought, though. Close up, I detect a few subtle creases both above and below her lips, crisp and thin like tally marks.

*“So, what’s next?”*

*“Well, the police will get a warrant to search your house. Presumably, they won’t find the murder weapon, but I don’t think that’ll steer them away from indictment, and they might elect to arrest you, regardless of what they discover. Do you have money to pay bail if they do?”*

I shake my head *no.*

*“Don’t worry. Just call me. I’ll see what I can do.”*

Danica is undeniably the single beacon shining in the depths of a very black night, but I don’t understand *why*, and the amount of things I just plain don’t understand are starting to weigh heavy on my chest like a load of bricks, making each breath shallow and agonizing.

*“What’s your angle?”*

She cocks her head.

*“I mean, why are you doing all this? What do you get out of helping me?”*

*“Do I need a reason to want to help someone? Someone who’s inches away from becoming just another martyr to a very old, very broken system?”*

I hesitate, but an answer eventually slips out.

*“Yes. I think so.”*

Tim knocks on the door and then swings it open.

*“Your two’o’clock is here, ma’am.”*

Danica forces a weak smile.

*“We’ll discuss this another time, Mateo. In the meantime, you need to be safe. If I were you, I wouldn’t go home. Call in a favor. Crash on someone’s couch. Just don’t skip town.”*

As I step out, she volunteers one more piece of unsolicited advice.

*“Might want to get that second cut looked at, too.”*

\- - - - - 

I make a stop on my way home, but it’s not back to the emergency room; it’s to the hardware store. The pair of wireless video cameras I can afford aren’t top of the line, but they’ll make do.

Just as the sun begins to set, I’ve finished installing them: one in my living room, one in my bedroom. I hop in my car, flip my laptop open in my lap, and drive until the feed starts to get hazy, which ends up being about halfway down the block.

Night falls.

The bitter sting of an energy drink trickles down my throat. I crush the can and lob it into the back seat. I have five more where that came from if need be.

I’m not sure what I think I’m going to catch, but my eyes remain glued to the screen in anticipation.

Hours pass. 

I chug another caffeine spritzer and wring my shoulders out. I wonder if paranoia is a known symptom of grief. I’m about to call off the amateur stakeout when I spot movement.

My jaw drops. I rub my finger so vigorously against the screen that it squeaks, but it’s no smudge, and it keeps moving, slithering through my house, searching for something.

Searching for *me*.

It came from under the door; pinched itself through the tiny space between the door and its frame.

A tube.

The front of it glides like an elephant trunk, fanning side to side, edges wrinkling like it’s sniffing the air, but it’s much, much longer. Five feet, ten feet, fifteen feet - the silent worm continues to elongate.

I can see it on the bedroom feed now.

My phone vibrates in my pocket. My entire body spasms. I yelp.

Clumsily, I retrieve it.

The name of the emergency room flashes across the screen. I silence the call and toss my phone into the cupholder.

I bring my eyes back to the feed. It’s rooting through a box of my clothes now. When it finds nothing, the head reappears, spinning in small, dizzy circles. Eventually, it springs forward and plunges into my laundry hamper, passing right by the camera lens as it does.

Paper-thin teeth line the rim. They’re shaped like candy corn. The tube itself is translucent. I can see the rest of my room through its diameter, though it’s blurry and distorted, as if you were to use an unwashed glass as a telescope.

All of sudden, I have an epiphany.

If it came from under the door, there should be *some* part of it lingering on my stoop, right? 

I try to look, but I can’t see my stoop from my position: there’s a mass of shrubs in the way. Setting my laptop on the dashboard above the steering wheel, I roll down the window, and shove my head out of the car.

With enough elevation, I see something. 

There’s someone standing at my door, facing away from me. 

They’re tall, and they’re naked. Their hair is long and uncut. Thin black strands dangle against the small of their back. 

My heart flutters wildly against my rib cage.

Movement on the video feed catches my attention. I throw myself back in the car and grab my laptop from the dashboard.

The snout of the tube is pointing straight up. The edges appear agitated, or excited; they’re expanding and contracting feverishly. From the size of a soup can to the size of a manhole cover and then back again, over, and over, and over.

Then, at a seemingly impossible speed, the tube retracts. 

It retreats from my bedroom to my living room to explode out from under the door like a bolt of lightning. 

I look up from the screen. 

My eyes bulge from their sockets. 

I launch myself back out the window.

There’s no one on my stoop anymore. 

A distant thrumming slinks into my ear. 

The sound is directly overhead. It’s eerily familiar, and it’s getting louder.

It’s getting louder, because *they’re* getting closer. 

A wave of panic surges through my skull. I ram the key into the ignition. My foot crashes onto the pedal. The acrid odor of burning rubber fills the air as I peel out, and I hope that masks my scent.

Because I think that’s how they found me in the first place.

\- - - - -  

I’m driving down the highway towards Miami. My body is depleted, but I don’t expect my mind will be ready to sleep for another few decades. I rack my brain, trying to place where I’ve heard that *thrumming* sound before.

Suddenly, a nagging question pops into my head.

How Danica know about the cut before I did?

I make a wild U-turn, nearly clipping a city bus as my car skids. 

The courthouse is in the other direction. 

\- - - - - 

*“Why did you kill Elise?”* I demand. 

Her overstuffed office feels like an oven in the early morning. Viscous globules of sweat pour from every inch of my body. My grip on the pocket knife becomes tenuous. I can feel the plastic handle sliding in my palm. Still, I point the blade at her like I plan on using it.

Danica doesn’t look frightened. She doesn’t look fazed at all, really.

She just sits at her desk, staring at me.

I decide to show her what I know.

I stomp around the side of her desk and begin ripping the tubes from her vest. I even slam my fist into the connected machine’s conveniently labeled *“OFF”* button for good measure. 

The vest stills. The machine powers down.

And yet, the *thrumming* continues, emanating from her chest, buzzing like the wings of some elephantine mosquito.

It was all just camouflage.

Guess she can’t control the noise. 

*“Why did you kill - “*

*“Not me,”* she mutters.

*“What…?”* I ask, not convinced that I heard her correctly.

She leans back in her chair and sighs. I shake the knife closer to her. It wobbles in my grasp.

*“You wouldn’t happen to know what was there before they built your housing complex, do you?”* She looks up and meets my gaze. Her sharp, bark-colored eyes bore vicious holes into me.

*“Of course you don’t,”* she continues. *“Well, it was an old slaughterhouse. A big one, too. A giant slaughterhouse perched above a massive reservoir. A strange pairing, but it worked just fine. Better than fine, actually. Plenty of blood dripping down that hill, and it all disappeared into the water.”*

The thrumming in her chest intensifies, becoming shrill, almost melodic.

*“It was a good system, Mateo. That arrangement held things in balance for nearly a century,”* she scowls, gathering the tubes and reinserting them into her vest with a glint of annoyance in her features.

*“But now, things are different: my nieces…my nieces are going hungry.”*

I step back, stumbling over loose papers on the floor. The corners of Danica’s mouth ripple. They extend a few centimeters from her face, and then quickly retract. Her teeth seem to swirl around her gums like shards of glass in a washing machine.

*“My one niece - Rossa - she’s a nasty, voracious little thing. I’ve seen her proboscis grow miles long, and boy, has she developed a taste for you.”*

I still have the knife pointed at her, and yet, she feels safe enough to turn away. She flicks the her fake appliance back on and begins tinkering with settings.

*“Your blood is different, she claims.”* Danica snaps her fingers. She’s trying to recall the word Rossa used.

*“Ah!”* she gasps, pivoting back to face me.

Leaning forward, she whispers: *“Sour. That’s what she said - ‘exhilaratingly sour’. Unfortunately, she can’t have very much at one time. Hurts her stomach. Still, she loves it. Unlike your partner, who was evidently quite bland in comparison, and not very filling…”*

My fear curdles into a seething rage. I squeeze the handle of the knife so hard that the bones in my fingers ache. I shoot towards her and place the edge to her throat. I expect her to recoil, but she tilts into my advance. The blade rests tightly on her skin.

*“Listen, Mateo - to answer your question from yesterday: yes, my desire to help you wasn’t purely altruistic. I suppose I feel partially responsible for your…situation. They are my kin, after all, and they haven’t developed self-control, or a place in your society, like I have…”*

She twists her neck. The knife draws blood. Delicate crimson dewdrops fall, sizzling as they contact the metal.

*“But don’t fool yourself. Killing me here changes nothing. In fact, I’d argue it would make your predicament substantially worse, because, at the end of the day, who will believe you? They didn’t believe you when you said you didn’t kill Elise. They didn’t believe you when you said you hit that boy with a beer bottle in self-defense.”*

She winks, then continues to whet the blade against her porcelain skin. More boiling blood sprays against the knife.

*“That ‘boy’ has been charged with multiple counts of assault since your encounter, by the way. I checked. A real bellicose individual, it seems.”*

Danica’s mouth narrows to the diameter of a straw. Like a tornado hovering over the earth, it skirts across the knife, suctioning the blood back into her gullet. I hear her shifting teeth clinking against the metal. It sounds like hail. 

Hot nausea licks at my tonsils. My entire body is becoming numb and heavy.

Once the knife practically sparkling, her mouth snaps back into its normal shape.

*“My question to you is this: why now? When you’re caught standing over my corpse, cradling a blood-drenched knife like it’s the only thing you have left in this world, why do you expect they’ll believe you* ***now****?”*

My grip on the blade loosens. Every painful emotion - all the terror, all the anger, all the hurt - seems to evaporate in my veins. They leak like steam into the stale air of her claustrophobic office.

Because she’s right.

I fold my knife inward, shove it in my pocket, and sprint from Danica’s office.

*“Only come back if you’re willing to cooperate,”* she shouts after me.

*“And if you see Rossa before I do, well, tell her I say hello.”*

And that brings me up to this evening.

I’ve thought long and hard about what Danica told me. Don’t know if her intention was truly one of guidance, but I’m thankful nonetheless. 

Like I mentioned, she’s absolutely right. As it stands, there’s no reason for anyone to believe what I have to say. It’s an outlandish story, and a pisspour alibi. The scales of logic and objectivity are weighted against me.

But that makes the solution simple. All I need to do is put my finger on the scales. Tip things back in my direction.

So that’s what I plan on doing. 

Right now, I’m sitting in my car with the windows rolled up tight, down the street from my house.

I just got off the phone with Detective Frank.

Told the poor bastard that I have *so much* to show him regarding Elise's murder. He can bring as many friends as he wants, too; he just needs to meet me here *now*.

If Rossa is truly as voracious as Danica claims, I figure she’ll make an appearance, flying up from the reservoir to get a taste of all this nice new blood. Either Frank will survive with the image of that human mosquito burned into the back of his eyeballs, or he won’t survive at all.

Seems like a win-win to me.

While I wait, I plan on listening to the message the emergency room left on my voicemail when they called last night.

The wrathful sun is beginning to set once again. 

Danica, if you somehow find this, I want to thank you for the wisdom.

I’m about to render that very same wisdom to sweet old Frank:

Seeing

truly is,

im about to start my espresso journey. First things first, I have to buy a setup.

Im from Germany, enjoying espresso and lattes equally. Most of the time I will be making 2 drinks at a time, twice a day.

My brother recently got his setup for about 600 Euros in total, and he is perfectly fine.

Im way more passionate about coffee in general, so im thinking about buying a more expensive setup.

Does is actually make a huge difference in taste or is it mainly about how long the setup will last/how the machine feels?

Here are my ideas for what I was thinking about to buy:

\- Ascaso Steel Duo PID V2 (1430 Euro on OTTO or coffeefriend) or Lelit Elizabeth (about 1000 Euro)

\- Timemore Sculptur 78s (720 Euro) or DF64 Gen 2 (about 400 Euro)

I just cant decide if its worth it or not D:",1,1763733383.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I didn’t kill Elise.

Yes, she died in my apartment.

Yes, I was by her side as her heart turned cold.

But God, no - I didn’t kill her.

It *may* look like we were alone, like no one broke in, but it’s a cruel trick. My fingerprints *may* be the only ones that were found on her body, but they didn’t need to lift a single finger to bleed her out.

So, I implore you - same as I’ve implored countless others - don’t write me off because it’s easy. Don’t send me upriver for the rest of my life because it’s convenient. 

Read what I have to say. Then, consider the blood.

Because the truth is in the blood.

Both mine *and* hers.

\- - - - - 

*That night, I heard her knocking at seven on the dot…*

I sit down the silverware I’d been unpacking, wipe a thick film of sweat from my forehead with the collar of my already drenched T-shirt, and walk to answer it. I must have been wearing my surprise like a pair of oversized novelty glasses, because the first thing out of her lips when she sees me is: 

*“You forgot about movie night, didn’t you?”*

I consider fibbing, but think better of it.

*“Sure did.”* 

Bowing as if in the presence of royalty, I hold the door open for her, gesturing inside my war zone of an apartment. A wolfish smirk creeps across her lips. She walks in, gives me a good-natured pat on the head, and tosses a family-sized bag of white cheddar popcorn onto my black leather sofa. A waft of perfume-soaked air whispers to me as she passes by; it smells of citrus and sea spray.

*“You’re a fortunate man, Mateo.”*

I nod. As the door’s deadbolt clicks into the lock, I find myself disagreeing with her. I've never felt like I've had much luck at all. I keep the sentiment internal.

She smells too nice to argue.

As we have sex, the wrathful Florida sun mercifully sets under the horizon, though that did little to cool us and the apartment, even after we were done.

Earlier that week, I’d begun moving into the townhome’s lower level, and - just my luck - the unit’s air conditioning wouldn’t turn on. I wasn’t entirely shocked. The row of newly constructed houses on the isolated strip of land looked like a rush job. Some were still only half-built, for God’s sake.

Far as I could tell, I was the only person living there, too.

There wasn’t a great alternative for cooling the apartment. Mitigating the boiling summer heat with dollar store plug-in fans, as the landlord had so graciously suggested before hanging up on me, was a *very* funny joke. 

Wasn’t keen on keeping the windows open either. 

Behind the house, a two-minute walk down a steep, overgrown hill, sequestered behind a rusty fence, there’s an abandoned reservoir. It’s the literal definition of a cesspool. A tub the size of a battleship filled to the brim with stagnant water, which of course meant it was a breeding ground for insects. The one time I cracked a window, a downright biblical swarm laid siege to my apartment within the hour. 

To keep out pests, I learned I had to maintain a tight perimeter.

I pull some fresh clothes from an open box in my bedroom. When I return, I apologize profusely for the stuffiness. Elise smiles. Dimples crest up her cheek like a stone skipping across the surface of a lake. She dismisses the apology with a wave of the hand, never one to pollute a quiet moment by dwelling on the unchangeable.

I loved that about her.

A few minutes later, we finally settle onto the couch. She opens the bag of popcorn. I pop on a movie. 

Whether out of grief, or longing, or some misplaced sense of responsibility for what happened, I replay the events of that night in my head every day, on an endless loop, over and over again until I start to feel physically sick. 

Every window was shut. The door was locked. I’m sure of it.

I have to be sure of it.

\- - - - - 

We’re reclining next to each other on the couch. It’s too hot to cuddle, but we’re still holding hands. Our feet are propped up on the coffee table.

It’s not perfect, but it’s damn close.

Exhaustion sets in. The move has been tiring. I’m fading in and out of sleep. The pearly light of the TV glitters against my tired eyes. All of a sudden, my body feels simultaneously hot and icy; a halfway point between being feverish and being drunk. 

I don’t mind the feeling. It’s not unpleasant; it’s just strange.

There’s this *whooshing* sound. It’s right next to my ear, but I can’t place what’s making it. The sound reminds of my baby sister using her asthma inhaler - sharp, breathy gulps - but it’s much, much quieter, barely audible.

My head leans back. We haven’t touched the remote for hours, so the TV clicks itself off.

I drift through a long, dreamless sleep. A cozy sort of paralysis.

Slivers of golden light needle my closed eyelids.

It’s morning. I start to stir.

I feel her hand before I see her. Woozy, vision focusing, I sort of think I’m feeling the couch: a palmful of cold, stiff leather.

But there are fingernails.

I turn to look at Elise.

Inches away, a pair of soulless, moon-tinted eyes stare back at me. Wilted skin wraps tightly around her skull. Makes the angles of her cheekbones look like two trapped elbows desperately trying to break free. Her craggy, shriveled lips are slightly pursed. There’s a slit across the side of her neck. Its pale edges are serrated and dainty: death-colored petals of a carnation blooming along the bank of the River Styx.

I stare back at her and wait patiently for this macabre dream to end.

My body is in the moment, reactive: heart galloping, breathing shallow, sweat torrential. My mind is anywhere *but* the moment: numb, emotionless, and nearly blank, save for one question:

*Where did all her blood go?*

It’s clearly not in her. It’s not on her, not even around the slit in her neck. I scan my apartment - the couch, the floor, the walls - it's all spotless. So, where the hell else could it be?

I review that damning peculiarity until, finally, my mind catches up.

This is no dream.

Then, the brain-splitting panic sets in.

I don’t have dreamless nights anymore. 

Now, every night, I dream of a ghost-white, bloodless Elise, lips pursed, perpetually about to speak.

But I always wake up before I hear what she wants to say.

\- - - - - 

My mind catalogued the day that followed into short, fragmented memories. A stack of blurry polaroids shuffled out of chronological order, but the story they tell always ends at the police station.

I’m sitting at a wobbly steel table across from Detective Frank. He’s quickly proven himself to be a real bastard, so when he demands that I address him by his last name, I make sure to call him Frank.

He has a small head on a narrow neck leading down to a monstrous, pulpy gut. His body is shaped like a tube sock stuffed with ground beef being held in the air, fabric sagging into a mushy ball as gravity fights to claim the meat. Either Frank or the interrogation room stinks of piss. No reason it couldn’t be both, I think.

He insists on asking me the same three questions:

*“Why’d ya kill her?”*

*“Where’d ya hide the knife?”*

and

*“Do you really see y’self gettin’ away with this?”*

By the time I’m being berated by Frank, I’m done earnestly pleading my innocence. Initially, I’d been appealing my case, saying things to dead-eyed police officers like: 

*“Why would I call it in if I was the one who hurt her?”*

or

*“I loved Elise.”*

or even

*“There should have been so much blood - where was all her blood?”*

No one believes me, though. No one has even *pretended* to believe me to save face. In a bitter, painful way, I’m not entirely surprised: a white girl was found dead in my apartment. Even if the mechanics of her death beggar belief, it doesn’t matter - I’ve been convicted by circumstance. Might as well have put a shotgun to her head in the middle of Times Square and pulled the trigger.

Eventually, Frank gets bored and starts to play dirty.

*“Would you say you have a history of violent behavior, Mateo?”* He doesn’t smile, but there’s an impish lilt in his voice. Frank is pleased because he knows it’s a trick question.

*“I didn’t hurt Elise.”* I mutter, bleary eyes fixed on a small crack in the table.

There’s a pause. My heart thumps indecipherable code against the back of my throat. All of a sudden, he shoots up from his chair like a puppet sprung from a jack-in-the-box and repeats the question with righteous zeal.

*“Would you say you have a history of violent behavior -* ***yes*** *or* ***no****?”*

Still, I don’t respond. I have no winning answer.

*“If you asked me…”* he starts, now smiling, *“…I’d say yes. Nearly blindin’ a poor young man with a broken beer bottle sounds pretty violent.”*

He wants me to bite, but I stay silent, gaze fixed on the crack in the table, dread bloating in my gut as I imagine all the ways it could have gotten there.

There’s a knock. 

I look up long enough to catch Frank’s dismay. His jaw is clenched tight enough to chip a tooth. He’s staring daggers at the steel door, but the person on the other side doesn’t wait for him to become civil; she enters.

Surprisingly, I recognize her. I’ve seen her interviewed on the news plenty, usually on the steps of the courthouse.

The woman is tall and slender. She has brittle, ancient-looking gray hair, but her porcelain skin is smooth, youthful, and confusingly wrinkleless. Her brown eyes are hard as stone. Her expression betrays confidence. The clunky, navy-colored vest strapped over her well-pressed Italian suit is the only piece of her that lacks poise, but the item is clearly one of necessity, not of choice. It’s gently vibrating against her chest. Plastic tubing connects the vest to a lunchbox-shaped machine resting atop a rolling metal cart behind her. A young man with tense, overly-slicked hair is standing beside the cart. I assume correctly that he’s an underling who’s been assigned the inglorious task of driving it. 

Her name is Danica. She’s a hotshot lawyer with an undisclosed lung disease - hence the vest. It vibrates to break up mucus or something. I have no idea what she’s doing in my interrogation room.

I didn’t call her, and whatever she costs, I certainly couldn’t afford her.

*“Same shit, different day - isn't that right, Frank?”* she booms.

He straightens his spine and sputters a few embarrassing half-words, none of which are worth mentioning.

*“Has this man even been to the hospital yet, Frank? I mean, for the love of God, he’s clearly injured.”*

She points a long, unpolished finger at my neck. I tilt my chin down to look to where she’s gesturing. To my profound bewilderment, she’s right: if I really crane my eyes, I can see the jagged corner of a cut peeking out from under my shirt collar. There’s a splotch of dried blood the size of a quarter next to the lip of it. I lift my hand and run a fingertip over the edges, feeling the laceration snake over my shoulder.

The area around the cut is swollen - absolutely ripe with trapped fluid - but it doesn’t hurt. Even when I press a trembling fingertip into the slit, feeling it plunge beneath my skin, so deep that I can appreciate the hot, spongy muscle lying at the bottom, all I sense is a dull pressure. Despite being open, the wound is dry. The sticky moisture of blood is completely absent. It's like the entire thing has been both anesthetized and clotted over.

How is *any* of that possible?

Before I can get too wrapped up in the question, Danica motions for me to follow her. I do as I’m instructed. I can feel Frank’s eyes crawling over my body as the door slams shut.

The hallway is buzzing with activity. My eyes squint against the phosphorescent bulbs overhead, which are blinding compared to the dim light of the interrogation room. The lawyer looms motionless in front of me, statuesque, her mechanical vest quietly pulsing.

*“I’ll be taking your case pro bono - do you understand what that means?”*

I nod slowly, though I’m not confused by the legalese; I’m confused why she’s representing me free of charge in the first place.

*“Great.”* She snaps her fingers. Her intern - an overeager twenty-something I’d later find out is named Tim - hands me her card.

*“First and foremost, get that cut checked out at the ER. Tim will call you tomorrow to set up a meeting. Do you have anywhere else to stay other than your apartment?”*

I do, but I lie.

*“No.”*

Her gaze narrows. She looks disappointed. Without another word, Danica turns and walks away.

I watch as she strides down the corridor, weaving herself through the crowd, nimble and elegant, never losing her pace.

All the while, Tim and her artificial tail struggle to keep up.

\- - - - - 

I sleep through most of the wait at the emergency room. 

I’m nudged awake by a nurse with a kind voice. I sit up straight, grimacing as I stretch. My neck is stiff. It aches from the awkward rest, body curled into a chair, head draped over its cushioned handle. In comparison, the deep, muscle-exposing gash in my shoulder still feels fine. No pain at all, and it’s barely bleeding. A few drops here and there. Nothing more.

I’m led by the nurse into an exam room that smells of days-old coffee and fresh bile. As I lower myself onto a hospital bed, a gruff physician with meteor-sized bags under his eyes stomps in after her. He inspects the wound with the tenderness of an MMA fighter, yanking and pulling the edges, out then in, lips open then closed, like he’s pretending to make it speak. I’m glad I can hardly feel it.

*“How the hell did you get cut like this?”* he barks into my ear.

I fabricate a story. Something about a construction accident. He grunts.

He draws a few blood tests to confirm I’m not in need of blood from the injury, which feels ass-backwards, taking blood to decide if I need *more* blood, but I don’t complain. Then, he sews the wound shut, and stomps off to see some other patients while the labs are cooking. I lay back on the hospital bed and try to relax.

While he’s gone, I think about the cut. 

Elise had an identically shaped cut across her neck. I figure it can’t be a coincidence, but that begs the question - why am I still alive? Why wasn’t I drained like she was?

As I consider the possible answers, misery digs its roots in deep. The chaos of being implicated in her murder led me to barricade my emotions in an act of self-preservation. Now, with the threat somewhat managed, that barricade was melting down.

Tears well. My chest feels tight. I’m scared, and I’m angry, and, God, I just don’t understand.

As if to comfort me, Elise materializes in my mind. Her bouncy, cocoa-colored curls. Her glacier-blue eyes. Her world-soothing smile.

The image flickers. Fades.

Then, all I can picture is her waxy, soot-tinted face and her soulless eyes; a pair of white grapes wilted to the size of raisins.

Dead Elise won’t leave, and I can’t get her to go.

Panic drips down my spine.

I leap up from the hospital bed and throw the sliding doors open. I hear the physician behind me. He’s attempting to flag me down. Something about my blood is off, he says. More tests are pending.

I’m not listening, and I don’t slow down.

Before long, I’m in an Uber, head leaning against the warm glass of the passenger side window, watching Miami dissolve on the horizon. When I step out of the car, the wrathful Florida sun is starting to set once again.

And there’s a humming in the air.

\- - - - - 

The evening devolves into an alcohol-fueled daze. 

I’m in my bedroom, slumped over my desk, head down. I lift the bottle from the floor and take a lazy sip. Whiskey burns a numb pleasure in the pit of my stomach.

I’m listlessly staring out the window that faces the hill behind my house. I can’t see the reservoir through the blackness, but I know it’s there. My neck feels tight and frozen, like someone is tenderly strangling me with an icepack, but my torso feels warm and full. There’s a gentle *whooshing* right next to my ear. None of this bothers me in the moment, not even when a human-shaped silhouette drifts into view outside the window, wearing the night like a shroud.

I squint, but I can’t make out their features. It’s just a blurry head with broad shoulders atop an unnaturally slender torso. The figure drifts closer. A rapid thrumming overwrites the *whooshing*. It sounds like the beating of helicopter blades.

Because of the sharp decline, it’s a fifteen-foot drop from that window to the ground.

How could anyone be standing there, and, more importantly,

where did Elise’s blood go?

\- - - - - 

I wake up gasping and terrified. 

I fall off the chair. My ass hits the floor with a painful *thump.* The half-empty whiskey bottle tips over in the commotion, clattering against the hardwood, spilling its copper contents into a small, sticky puddle.

It’s morning. No specter of death hovering outside my window - just harsh sunlight.

A groan mixed with a sigh billows from my lips. I’m about to get myself upright when I notice something odd. 

There’s a slight wetness beneath my shirt, but it’s not on the correct side. My healing cut is on the right shoulder, not the left, and it’s bandaged - it shouldn’t be leaking *anything*. 

I rip off the shirt, jump upright, and sprint to the bathroom.

When I flick on the light, there it is: 

another identical cut. 

A mirror image of the older one hidden under the white bandage.

It doesn’t hurt.

It’s barely bleeding.

And for some inexplicable reason, unlike Elise,

I remain unfortunately alive. 

\- - - - - 

Honestly, I expected Danica’s office to match her character. Lavish. Larger than life. A corner office at the apex of some monolithic skyscraper. In reality, the space is little more than a broom closet with a filing cabinet in the courthouse's basement. Tim has to wait in the hall to make room for me.

Her desk is cluttered with used coffee cups and haphazard stacks of jaundiced legal paper. She leans forward and asks me to recount the events of that night. Her gaze is intense. Minutes turn to hours, and she never seems to blink.

At first, I’m reluctant. I know the story sounds unhinged; I can hardly believe it myself. Danica was different, though. She didn’t sneer. She didn’t roll her eyes. Even when I show her the second cut, she remains neutrally attentive. It’s an incredible breath of fresh air.

*“Do you believe me?”* I ask.

*“That’s not really the point,”* she quips. There’s a pause. The soft buzzing of her vest fills the silence. After what felt like days of unbroken eye contact, her gaze floats away from me.

*“But I do, yes.”*

I watch the words stumble over her tongue; each syllable is slow and drawn out. Bathed in the piercing glow of the ceiling bulbs, her porcelain skin almost appears to gleam. It’s not as perfectly smooth as I first thought, though. Close up, I detect a few subtle creases both above and below her lips, crisp and thin like tally marks.

*“So, what’s next?”*

*“Well, the police will get a warrant to search your house. Presumably, they won’t find the murder weapon, but I don’t think that’ll steer them away from indictment, and they might elect to arrest you, regardless of what they discover. Do you have money to pay bail if they do?”*

I shake my head *no.*

*“Don’t worry. Just call me. I’ll see what I can do.”*

Danica is undeniably the single beacon shining in the depths of a very black night, but I don’t understand *why*, and the amount of things I just plain don’t understand are starting to weigh heavy on my chest like a load of bricks, making each breath shallow and agonizing.

*“What’s your angle?”*

She cocks her head.

*“I mean, why are you doing all this? What do you get out of helping me?”*

*“Do I need a reason to want to help someone? Someone who’s inches away from becoming just another martyr to a very old, very broken system?”*

I hesitate, but an answer eventually slips out.

*“Yes. I think so.”*

Tim knocks on the door and then swings it open.

*“Your two’o’clock is here, ma’am.”*

Danica forces a weak smile.

*“We’ll discuss this another time, Mateo. In the meantime, you need to be safe. If I were you, I wouldn’t go home. Call in a favor. Crash on someone’s couch. Just don’t skip town.”*

As I step out, she volunteers one more piece of unsolicited advice.

*“Might want to get that second cut looked at, too.”*

\- - - - - 

I make a stop on my way home, but it’s not back to the emergency room; it’s to the hardware store. The pair of wireless video cameras I can afford aren’t top of the line, but they’ll make do.

Just as the sun begins to set, I’ve finished installing them: one in my living room, one in my bedroom. I hop in my car, flip my laptop open in my lap, and drive until the feed starts to get hazy, which ends up being about halfway down the block.

Night falls.

The bitter sting of an energy drink trickles down my throat. I crush the can and lob it into the back seat. I have five more where that came from if need be.

I’m not sure what I think I’m going to catch, but my eyes remain glued to the screen in anticipation.

Hours pass. 

I chug another caffeine spritzer and wring my shoulders out. I wonder if paranoia is a known symptom of grief. I’m about to call off the amateur stakeout when I spot movement.

My jaw drops. I rub my finger so vigorously against the screen that it squeaks, but it’s no smudge, and it keeps moving, slithering through my house, searching for something.

Searching for *me*.

It came from under the door; pinched itself through the tiny space between the door and its frame.

A tube.

The front of it glides like an elephant trunk, fanning side to side, edges wrinkling like it’s sniffing the air, but it’s much, much longer. Five feet, ten feet, fifteen feet - the silent worm continues to elongate.

I can see it on the bedroom feed now.

My phone vibrates in my pocket. My entire body spasms. I yelp.

Clumsily, I retrieve it.

The name of the emergency room flashes across the screen. I silence the call and toss my phone into the cupholder.

I bring my eyes back to the feed. It’s rooting through a box of my clothes now. When it finds nothing, the head reappears, spinning in small, dizzy circles. Eventually, it springs forward and plunges into my laundry hamper, passing right by the camera lens as it does.

Paper-thin teeth line the rim. They’re shaped like candy corn. The tube itself is translucent. I can see the rest of my room through its diameter, though it’s blurry and distorted, as if you were to use an unwashed glass as a telescope.

All of sudden, I have an epiphany.

If it came from under the door, there should be *some* part of it lingering on my stoop, right? 

I try to look, but I can’t see my stoop from my position: there’s a mass of shrubs in the way. Setting my laptop on the dashboard above the steering wheel, I roll down the window, and shove my head out of the car.

With enough elevation, I see something. 

There’s someone standing at my door, facing away from me. 

They’re tall, and they’re naked. Their hair is long and uncut. Thin black strands dangle against the small of their back. 

My heart flutters wildly against my rib cage.

Movement on the video feed catches my attention. I throw myself back in the car and grab my laptop from the dashboard.

The snout of the tube is pointing straight up. The edges appear agitated, or excited; they’re expanding and contracting feverishly. From the size of a soup can to the size of a manhole cover and then back again, over, and over, and over.

Then, at a seemingly impossible speed, the tube retracts. 

It retreats from my bedroom to my living room to explode out from under the door like a bolt of lightning. 

I look up from the screen. 

My eyes bulge from their sockets. 

I launch myself back out the window.

There’s no one on my stoop anymore. 

A distant thrumming slinks into my ear. 

The sound is directly overhead. It’s eerily familiar, and it’s getting louder.

It’s getting louder, because *they’re* getting closer. 

A wave of panic surges through my skull. I ram the key into the ignition. My foot crashes onto the pedal. The acrid odor of burning rubber fills the air as I peel out, and I hope that masks my scent.

Because I think that’s how they found me in the first place.

\- - - - -  

I’m driving down the highway towards Miami. My body is depleted, but I don’t expect my mind will be ready to sleep for another few decades. I rack my brain, trying to place where I’ve heard that *thrumming* sound before.

Suddenly, a nagging question pops into my head.

How Danica know about the cut before I did?

I make a wild U-turn, nearly clipping a city bus as my car skids. 

The courthouse is in the other direction. 

\- - - - - 

*“Why did you kill Elise?”* I demand. 

Her overstuffed office feels like an oven in the early morning. Viscous globules of sweat pour from every inch of my body. My grip on the pocket knife becomes tenuous. I can feel the plastic handle sliding in my palm. Still, I point the blade at her like I plan on using it.

Danica doesn’t look frightened. She doesn’t look fazed at all, really.

She just sits at her desk, staring at me.

I decide to show her what I know.

I stomp around the side of her desk and begin ripping the tubes from her vest. I even slam my fist into the connected machine’s conveniently labeled *“OFF”* button for good measure. 

The vest stills. The machine powers down.

And yet, the *thrumming* continues, emanating from her chest, buzzing like the wings of some elephantine mosquito.

It was all just camouflage.

Guess she can’t control the noise. 

*“Why did you kill - “*

*“Not me,”* she mutters.

*“What…?”* I ask, not convinced that I heard her correctly.

She leans back in her chair and sighs. I shake the knife closer to her. It wobbles in my grasp.

*“You wouldn’t happen to know what was there before they built your housing complex, do you?”* She looks up and meets my gaze. Her sharp, bark-colored eyes bore vicious holes into me.

*“Of course you don’t,”* she continues. *“Well, it was an old slaughterhouse. A big one, too. A giant slaughterhouse perched above a massive reservoir. A strange pairing, but it worked just fine. Better than fine, actually. Plenty of blood dripping down that hill, and it all disappeared into the water.”*

The thrumming in her chest intensifies, becoming shrill, almost melodic.

*“It was a good system, Mateo. That arrangement held things in balance for nearly a century,”* she scowls, gathering the tubes and reinserting them into her vest with a glint of annoyance in her features.

*“But now, things are different: my nieces…my nieces are going hungry.”*

I step back, stumbling over loose papers on the floor. The corners of Danica’s mouth ripple. They extend a few centimeters from her face, and then quickly retract. Her teeth seem to swirl around her gums like shards of glass in a washing machine.

*“My one niece - Rossa - she’s a nasty, voracious little thing. I’ve seen her proboscis grow miles long, and boy, has she developed a taste for you.”*

I still have the knife pointed at her, and yet, she feels safe enough to turn away. She flicks the her fake appliance back on and begins tinkering with settings.

*“Your blood is different, she claims.”* Danica snaps her fingers. She’s trying to recall the word Rossa used.

*“Ah!”* she gasps, pivoting back to face me.

Leaning forward, she whispers: *“Sour. That’s what she said - ‘exhilaratingly sour’. Unfortunately, she can’t have very much at one time. Hurts her stomach. Still, she loves it. Unlike your partner, who was evidently quite bland in comparison, and not very filling…”*

My fear curdles into a seething rage. I squeeze the handle of the knife so hard that the bones in my fingers ache. I shoot towards her and place the edge to her throat. I expect her to recoil, but she tilts into my advance. The blade rests tightly on her skin.

*“Listen, Mateo - to answer your question from yesterday: yes, my desire to help you wasn’t purely altruistic. I suppose I feel partially responsible for your…situation. They are my kin, after all, and they haven’t developed self-control, or a place in your society, like I have…”*

She twists her neck. The knife draws blood. Delicate crimson dewdrops fall, sizzling as they contact the metal.

*“But don’t fool yourself. Killing me here changes nothing. In fact, I’d argue it would make your predicament substantially worse, because, at the end of the day, who will believe you? They didn’t believe you when you said you didn’t kill Elise. They didn’t believe you when you said you hit that boy with a beer bottle in self-defense.”*

She winks, then continues to whet the blade against her porcelain skin. More boiling blood sprays against the knife.

*“That ‘boy’ has been charged with multiple counts of assault since your encounter, by the way. I checked. A real bellicose individual, it seems.”*

Danica’s mouth narrows to the diameter of a straw. Like a tornado hovering over the earth, it skirts across the knife, suctioning the blood back into her gullet. I hear her shifting teeth clinking against the metal. It sounds like hail. 

Hot nausea licks at my tonsils. My entire body is becoming numb and heavy.

Once the knife practically sparkling, her mouth snaps back into its normal shape.

*“My question to you is this: why now? When you’re caught standing over my corpse, cradling a blood-drenched knife like it’s the only thing you have left in this world, why do you expect they’ll believe you* ***now****?”*

My grip on the blade loosens. Every painful emotion - all the terror, all the anger, all the hurt - seems to evaporate in my veins. They leak like steam into the stale air of her claustrophobic office.

Because she’s right.

I fold my knife inward, shove it in my pocket, and sprint from Danica’s office.

*“Only come back if you’re willing to cooperate,”* she shouts after me.

*“And if you see Rossa before I do, well, tell her I say hello.”*

\- - - - - 

And that brings me up to this evening.

I’ve thought long and hard about what Danica told me. Don’t know if her intention was truly one of guidance, but I’m thankful nonetheless. 

Like I mentioned, she’s absolutely right. As it stands, there’s no reason for anyone to believe what I have to say. It’s an outlandish story, and a pisspour alibi. The scales of logic and objectivity are weighted against me.

But that makes the solution simple. All I need to do is put my finger on the scales. Tip things back in my direction.

So that’s what I plan on doing. 

Right now, I’m sitting in my car with the windows rolled up tight, down the street from my house.

I just got off the phone with Detective Frank.

Told the poor bastard that I have *so much* to show him regarding Elise's murder. He can bring as many friends as he wants, too; he just needs to meet me here *now*.

If Rossa is truly as voracious as Danica claims, I figure she’ll make an appearance, flying up from the reservoir to get a taste of all this nice new blood. Either Frank will survive with the image of that human mosquito burned into the back of his eyeballs, or he won’t survive at all.

Seems like a win-win to me.

While I wait, I plan on listening to the message the emergency room left on my voicemail when they called last night.

The wrathful sun is beginning to set once again. 

Danica, if you somehow find this, I want to thank you for the wisdom.

I’m about to render that very same wisdom to sweet old Frank:

Seeing

truly is,

Deep house music in South Africa is much more than a genre; it is a vibrant fusion combining traditional African rhythms with the dynamic energy of electronic dance music. From its roots in South African townships to becoming a global phenomenon, South African deep house is distinguished by its deep connection to African culture, politics, and identity. This article explores the house music genre in South Africa, its most influential artists, and the evolution of a sound that has captivated audiences worldwide.







\\# Evolution and Unique Features of Deep House in South Africa







South African deep house blends traditional house music with influences from Kwaito and traditional African music, especially African rhythms and soulful vocals that give it its characteristic essence. Pioneer artists such as Black Coffee, Euphonix, and emerging producers like Verdagris and Thorne Miller mix African instruments like saxophone and piano with modern synthesizers, creating a sound that ranges between 80 and 160 BPM, maintaining a hypnotic and emotional vibe. This fusion is not just musical but cultural, reflecting social and political messages that have accompanied the scene since the post-apartheid era.







This evolution has fueled a vibrant underground scene with DJs and producers bringing the music to festivals and clubs both in South Africa and on international stages, contributing to the global Afro house phenomenon.







\\# Prominent Artists and Their Global Impact







Black Coffee stands as the most influential artist in this genre, having taken Afro house from Johannesburg clubs to major festivals like Coachella and Tomorrowland. Other notable talents include underground South African DJs like Vinny Da Vinci, Jullian Gomes, and Kid Fonque, who continue to shape the electronic dance music scene in South Africa.







Women have played a key role in this movement, with figures such as DJ Cndo, Bucie, and DJ Zinhle contributing significantly to the sound and culture of Afro house. The diversity and richness of South African deep house are reflected in its collaborations and rising popularity on global platforms like Beatport, where Afro house ranks as the fourth most searched genre worldwide.







\\# Cultural and Social Influences







South African deep house reflects the social and political realities of the country. Its development is linked to the post-apartheid context and the spirit of cultural resistance and freedom. In the townships, DIY production using tools like FruityLoops has enabled music to flourish independently, supported by informal distribution networks and community efforts.







Moreover, the music accompanies communal celebrations and parties, serving as a vehicle for important social and political messages in South African identity. African rhythms, singing in local languages, and influences from Kwaito further strengthen this connection.







\\# Frequently Asked Questions About South African House Music







\\# Who are the most popular South African house artists?







Black Coffee, Euphonix, DJ Cndo, DJ Zinhle, Vinny Da Vinci, Jullian Gomes, and Kid Fonque are among the leading figures in South African house music in 2025.







\\# How did South African house music emerge in the 1990s?







It emerged as a blend of global house music styles with traditional African rhythms and Kwaito from the townships, as a form of cultural expression and resistance during and after apartheid.







\\# What are the best classic South African house songs?







While classics include works from pioneering artists, new releases continue to energize clubs and festivals with timeless appeal.







\\# What influence does South African house music have on global music?







It has propelled Afro house to global fame, shaping international electronic genres and bringing African sounds to worldwide audiences.







\\# Where can I stream full South African house mixes?







Platforms such as Spotify, Beatport, and YouTube channels like Chill Gang offer playlists and continuous mixes featuring the best of South African deep house.







\\# Conclusion: The Cultural and Global Power of South African Deep House







South African deep house is more than just music; it is a living expression of African culture and South African history. Its social, political, and musical impact makes it a powerful tool for identity and liberation. The genre’s growing global popularity and the authenticity of its artists ensure that South African deep house will continue to thrive in international festivals and community life alike. For electronic music lovers, diving into this genre means experiencing African rhythms, profound messages, and an unmatched energy born from the fusion of tradition and modernity.

My partner and I are moving in together next month and we need to furnish the living room. I've been checking some sofas and I have a few possibilities. My question is, from the choices which one would be the most comfortable, easy to change placements and aesthetically pleasing? 

My thoughts for now are:

1. Love the pink chaise long but it might limit the placement of the coffee table and other furniture

2.The white one can turn into a bed which is a plus but I'm not sure about the linen fabric (I prefer soft fabrics like chenille)

3.White chaise long might be a good option but I lean more on the pink one to add colour to the space

4. The white one that looks like a cloud has a cool design but I'm not sure if it's gonna be comfortable

We have both been going to therapy and both Ben figuring out what caused this rapid decline, but more importantly how to be better and allow this to happen. 

I had been feeling wildly unconsidered, and on the back burner, but more importantly, feeling like when I communicate that to him, he can hear the words, but not truly understand or show any action to fix it. 

Until this morning….

here has a company potluck at work today, so last night he was baking a cake that he is known for at work. I’ve had this cake before, and it is truly delicious! He only made one cake, so I commented on how good it smelled, and how good it looked coming out of the oven, but I did not ask for a piece because who would bring in a cake with one slice taken out of it into work.

This morning, I made my coffee and I always sit in the same chair while I drink it. As I walked over to the chair, I noticed a container with a slice of cake in it. He thought about me. He didn’t care about taking that cake in with one slice missing. I didn’t have to ask. I was on his mind before he even went to work. 

So I’m sitting here eating a piece of cake and for the first time in a long time I can see the future.

1p2yyve,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p2yyve/my_espresso_journey/,My Espresso journey,"Hey all,

Wanted to share my brown beans journey with you all.  
I started when I moved to my appartment, I was alone and had a simple Black and Decker drip machine.  
It was ok, but taste was not there. FWIW I am in Canada and this was like 20 years ago.  
I asked (and received) a Moka Express for my birthday, I loved it and still have it.  
But it had 2 drawbacks:  
1- it was 6 cups only, a bit too much for a single person every morning....says the doc

2-My girlfriend thought the taste was too strong for her (I disagree)

We decided to keep the Bialetti for Camping, and use her Bodum French press afterward.

Clumsy as she is, she broke it, then broke another one, and another one...

We then got another drip machine. but with a grinder. Taste was better but still nothing close to Moka pot.

Then another issue arised!  
The dog got crazy whenever he heard the grinder, like batshit crazy. So we had to get rid of that.

I wanted to have that espresso taste back, for simplicity and flexibility's sake, we ended up with Nespresso.

Girlfriend could get less intense coffee, and I could get more intense. with a newborn child, it was super convenient to get 1 button coffee. But then 2 more issues:  
1- its noisy, making it difficult to get coffee when the kid is asleep or the other adult who was up all night.  
2-Cost!!! with 2 coffee each per day, this was all but economic!

So we went back to a drip... for the last 3 years

But, the espresso, to me, was still missing... and my girlfriend likes lattes

So yesterday I purchased a super automatic, noise is not an issue anymore since we have a more stable routine and my kid is older. and we now have flexibility

**\[Last Time, on Alien-Nation Z (many moons ago…)** Elias took Amilita’s son to the beach. That’s it. That’s about the bulk of what happened.

In the chapter before that, Gavin and Sullivan told him about a school in orbit that has military secrets aboard it, along with being attended by a lot of important people, and that he needs to apply there, try to get accepted, and then steal military secrets (e.g., metallurgical processes, military hardware schematics, etc.,). They’ll pitch in to try and help in various ways. This comes after they had an argument re: George in command of New Jersey’s rebellion, which has so far not been very successful. This is in contrast to some of the other neighboring states where they managed to suggest some candidates for leadership. (Vast oversimplification of matters, but I’m aware quite some time has passed.)\]

*****

\[**A/N 2:** I thought I’d get a little experimental and switch a bit of this up into Present Tense. At the time, I felt it had a good feeling to it, so I kept it over the version I cut out, which was in the more traditional style. I hope the style switch isn’t too jarring, please let me know in the comments what you think!\]

*****

Everything of the last week had been spent running myself ragged. Favors called and appointments set. They immediately turned into one great big blur of meeting people whose faces I’d never seen of outside of briefings from Verns’s election tracker. All of them went, in some fashion:

Smile. Get told ‘it’s a video, not a photo’. Another shake with the clammy aged hand, a feeling of frailty clinging to him even if the usual liver spots are surgically removed through some new process. Manage another smile and put a signature on paper. Measure those eyes, looking for some crinkle and hesitation that hints at what unspeakable thing Gavin and Sullivan did to arrange this if it was some sort of threat, or if they don’t know and think it happened organically. Hell, for all I know, it did. Wonder if this is what imposter syndrome feels like.

Wonder what happens to the paper that now bears his signature- it’s not in a language most Shil’vati can read. Actually, of what use is it to the shil’vati? How *did* they sign documents? Was I going to get a second copy and wave the stack of them I now had in front of some bored alien’s face and pretend they meant anything to her? Wonder how many would be ‘enough’? Alter my musings to wonder how many of these papers it would take for an insurgent to walk onto a base, full mask on and everything.

Realize I am so absorbed by the image of this theoretical insurgent driving a forklift forward to one very alarmed shil’vati gate guard that I have now been staring where I last set my eyes- straight into his own dead ones, a soulless gaze that has me instinctually release my grip on his hand. “Thank you,” I say for what feels too reflexive to be genuine. Feel as though the place around me is already rubbing off on me, or rather peeling away parts of me until I am nothing more than the man in front of me. “I won’t let you down.” A lie, told to someone I hate, yet I cannot bring myself to think it an honorable thing to do even in the pursuit of a good cause.

Whether he believes me is irrelevant so long as I walk out of here with a piece of paper, right? Little stamped pieces of paper are what matters in this world and I cannot wait to gather the final two pieces. Those ones at least, I can put a face and a name to.

This lasted until I ran out of names on the list I’d been given.

At last, I am done. Two more to go, but they need to be last, to be presented with a demonstration of all my hard work. For, of all the human bureaucrats I have met, not all of them combined amount to the value of either’s signatures.

## Sharing the News

I was still sitting a little ill-at-ease from the bit of sunburn I’d caught between riding all around Delaware attending these meetings and Rehoboth Beach. I’d tanned over the spring, but not enough to compensate for forgetting to lather up and now was suffering the consequences.

Jacqueline at the dinner table was positively beaming. “I got in,” she finally dropped the news, and traded a look with Dad. He greeted the announcement with a jolt upright from his usual slouch and a cheerful, suddenly energetic: “Hey-Ey!”

He leaned across the table, giant hand slapping against her palm in a hi-five before clapping twice and leaning back in his wooden chair, the fine thin beams that made its backing flexed as he looked skyward in praise. Then he glanced around the table at our reactions, expecting jubilation and only finding an uncertain happiness from me.

“I got an internship in Pennsylvania,” Jacqueline explained. “Penn Medicine’s pre-entry program.” She looked back over at Dad, who beamed with pride.

“Those references I lined up really helped out, huh?” He asked.

“Yeah, guess so,” she said, almost dismissive. She seemed convinced she’d done it all herself, no connections needed. I was somewhat more doubtful, and I suppose she picked up on that because her smile turned to a sneer when she spotted me from the corner of her eye. She held it there, rubbing in how she was still at least father’s golden child.

I looked over at Mother. What could she do for me, then? I already had a clean bill of health from Doctor Harriet, and she’d certainly had no hand in arranging that beyond taking me there. Mother was looking back at me, too, as if expecting me to pipe up with some achievement of my own. Or evaluating me.

“I uh,” I started.

The thing was, I didn’t really have anything to point to. The viewership numbers for my latest video had tanked. All I’d been told was that it was ‘something about not wanting to promote Delaware anymore’. I could guess that the Interior, some regional power, or maybe even the Grand Poo-Bah that Sullivan had mentioned had finally realized that making the state’s peace into some kind of positive example was the wrong sort of thing to do.

I could feel the oppressive weight of expectation pressing down on me. ‘I went to New Jersey earlier,’ wouldn’t mean much. Neither would how I’d spent the day hanging out with Amilita and her son. I’d been less surprised at his attitude and more by the base-standard outfit he’d been wearing, I thought he would have brought his own. “I met the new Governess.”

“We know,” Jacqueline rolled her eyes. “You brought her here.”

I guess Old News didn’t cut it.

Mother’s eyes bulged out of her head- but stared right at me, not Jacqueline.

“She seems nice,” I tried something inoffensive.

“That’s it?” Mother asked, railroading right over me. “Aliens visit our house, including the Governess herself, and that’s all you have to say? ‘She seems nice’? I hope you were polite to her, at least, more polite than you were to me! I had no idea what you were saying to them the entire time.”

I wanted to snap: *It’s not like they wanted to visit* you *or anything!* I’d made the connection to Amilita through Natalie, and now to Cre’sin through Amilita. Hell, Mother could have made use of my school omni-pad to translate, if she had ever bothered learning to use one.

“She came by because General Amilita likes me, it’s not that complicated.”

That was the wrong thing to say. Mother cocked her head slightly, and those bright blue eyes stared right into my soul.

“Have you ever considered that she only came by because of your videos?”

I hadn’t, actually. I’d never thought that, ever. But it cut right to an anxiety I had been consciously avoiding. Larry’s advice that people sometimes did things for each other had let me ignore it. I’d been able to operate on faith, kindness.

“How do you know she even really likes you?” She followed up to my lack of an answer, compounding the worry, the fear. The agitation. “What else makes you so special to her?”

“Well,” I hesitated. It was a bit premature to announce this. “It has been suggested that I apply to a shil’vati school.” They didn’t need to know that the suggestion hadn’t come from either Amilita or Cre’sin.

I smiled a bit at my mom’s startled expression. Then I glanced around the table, measuring the others’ reactions. My father’s face was stunned. My sister’s was…well, unsurprising, given that I’d since learned she didn’t really loathe me for either weakness or incompetence, but something else. Still, I’d settle for what I’d won myself: A moment’s respite.

“But your grades,” My mother breathed. “I was going to assign you a life coach to help you get organized since you kept losing your homeworks.” Great. Just wonderful. More folders and binders to contain things I had less than zero interest in completing.

“They’re fine,” I answered, already having found Talay’s midterm reports in the library’s filing cabinet and swapped them out, per Gavin’s suggestion. Her eyes only widened at my surety as she gripped the table’s rough planks with a tension normally reserved for uprooting stubborn ferns.

She locked her eyes onto mine, as some spark entered her mind, some new line of attack in the guise of a question. “Do you speak the language well enough? Do you *really?* Do you know their units of measurement? They’re different to ours, I hear. What if you get them wrong in something like chemistry? And what about all the formulas in math, surely those are different enough to where you’ll fail there, too? What if they teach completely differently? Are boys safe up there?” The blitz came, each interrogative on the heels of another faster than I could even think to answer, even if I’d known.

I felt like a pinned down, slimy little cockroach under a limelight. I was a fraud. Gavin and Sullivan had changed my grades to help my cause. Already my earlier confidence was now but vapor, dissipating and mixing with the faintest whiff of ozone after the barrage.

Mother had the unique ability to undermine any courage I’d had in any endeavor until I was left doubting whether I should have bothered trying, or even thinking of it in the first place. This was ‘just her way of showing interest’, she always said. I found it more like trying to pin me down and henpeck my logic and decisions until I could only scream: ‘I don’t know, I guess I’m not that clever, I guess I’m not good enough and never will be!’

A year ago I’d have said she was just worried ‘as mothers do,’ but now I knew better. Mary-Anne saw the smile I’d donned as inside my armor cracked and failed, and as mine died hers took on life, like a vampire draining the life from me. Hers was the mocking sneer of a victor, tinged with the slightest hint of something worse than sympathy: Pity.

Had I tried to rise too far, too fast? Perhaps Jacqueline felt I hadn’t put in the real work, either, and that was why she loathed me. Didn’t deserve to go.

My father’s face was grim, something unpleasant behind it as he glanced between mother and me, as if begging to know how I’d come to be as I was. Left wanting, in some way. Perhaps if he’d spent an iota of the time with me that he spent on Jacqueline, perhaps with his connections, with his help, with his tutoring, I could legitimately have tossed my hat in…but no, all that was old stuff, wasn’t it? None of it would have mattered, and crying over spilt milk wasn’t going to help either.

I wanted to turn back into that scared little boy I’d been, when last Jacqueline was here. I forced myself to remain still, give no sign that they’d had this effect on me.

I’d have thought they’d have all been happy at the news. More esteem to the family. They wouldn’t have to pay for tuition to St. Michael’s.

Wait, did Vanguard cost anything to attend? How could I pay, if it did? How would we pay for it? God, I was such an idiot.

Why did it matter? As long as I went up there, took the information, then who cared why I was doing it?

*We will do what must be done, because no one else will.* I heard Larry’s words and felt my resolve steel and clung to it like a wire.

If I didn’t go up to that school, some other poor kid would. Someone with an even worse grasp of the language, who didn’t have the experience of pulling apart their technology and adapting it into railguns, gravity belts, and more.

Someone else who didn’t have the need or intention to use it to save humanity, leaving us reliant on someone whose loyalty was in doubt, and might double-agent us. They might feed us information that would lead to disaster.

Whatever it took to bring those stolen prizes down to the surface of the Earth, I’d do. Even if I found myself chained to a mountain with my [liver plucked out for the sin of it for all eternity](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Prometheus_and_Atlas%2C_Laconian_black-figure_kylix%2C_by_the_Arkesilas_Painter%2C_560-550_BC%2C_inv._16592_-_Museo_Gregoriano_Etrusco_-_Vatican_Museums_-_DSC01069.jpg/800px-Prometheus_and_Atlas%2C_Laconian_black-figure_kylix%2C_by_the_Arkesilas_Painter%2C_560-550_BC%2C_inv._16592_-_Museo_Gregoriano_Etrusco_-_Vatican_Museums_-_DSC01069.jpg).

I was tired of sitting around. Enough pieces were in place, tagging along with Amilita and her real son had been the cherry on top. I saw the score yesterday. I was the spare. Like how with Jacqueline around again, I might be relegated from ‘surrogate’ down to ‘something useful.’ Not anything *real.* It was time that changed. Time I went and *did something.*

I stood from the table. “In fact,” I dabbed at the corner of my mouth with the fine cloth napkin, making a show of the manners mother had always tried drilling into me and locking eyes for the briefest moment as I rose to my fullest height. Now I stood over them all. I refused to cower and let them make me feel small anymore. “I’m going by the Raktens later to discuss it. Have a good rest of dinner.”

*****

# Leap Before You Look

My message had been brief and unprompted. Three words: *I’m coming over.*

The Raktens and I were close enough to where I didn’t need to bother waiting for a response. Much to my disappointment, they didn’t go out much these days, not even with the passes I’d printed. Instead, some kind of mix of homeschooling and finishing school for Natalie had been the order of each and every day since the peace. I felt somewhat guilty for that, truthfully. 

The pearlescent purple dome house loomed as I vaulted the ancient stone wall at the usual spot where I knew they were still well set, afraid to dirty my unusual clothing choice- the shil’vati outfit I’d been gifted by Amilita during my tour of their base from over a year ago. Though I’d been distracted by the terror of being picked up by the aliens and popping up on their radar, I swore it didn’t feel like it was being stretched to the strangely stretchy fabric’s limit.

I also knew just by the weight it was slightly different to the actual military uniforms they wore, and the colors were a brighter sky blue than the stripes the Marines usually were detailed with. Even so, I felt it stretch unnaturally and I clipped the edge, just barely managing to stumble instead of fall and cover myself with grass stains.

Recovering neatly, I trotted up to the ‘front’ door that judging by the trampled path I’d worn being the only one, suggested I was the only one to use it. Made sense, as this place didn’t have a driveway per se, and they only ever left by using their flying car.

Still, if I was going through all this extra effort to do this ‘officially’ then I wanted to do this ‘right,’ not through the back door like some thief. I wanted to feel like I’d earned my place, even as anxious as that made me, knowing full well I only wanted to get there to steal what they had.

Maybe I *should* try for the back door…

My hesitation had me beat down the grass they somehow kept at shin height. I wasn’t sure whether it was out of consideration for local custom, or an understanding that while Lyme had a cure now, it still wasn’t yet eradicated and *definitely* would have still sucked to get, no pun intended.

I crested the small hill their house was plopped atop of, and came around the- well, the house had a few corners, few bits jutting out from the domed building for either structural or other unfathomable reasons. And there, several dozen feet from what might be some sort of patio equivalent, was my girlfriend.

The Shil’vati girl was standing in the middle of a field of flowers, wearing a traditional shil’vati outfit that for once complemented her fine, glossy dark hair. She was dutifully reciting something in High Shil to her omni-pad while Morsh kept a watchful eye, cutting Natalie off, who in turn either said or did something that made Morsh’s frown deepen a bit. Morsh irritatedly gestured at me and shut the omni-pad’s projector off, seemingly releasing Natalie from her daily lesson on ‘How To Be A Proper Lady 101.’

I had to admit that Natalie had at least started sort of looking the part, even if the effect was utterly ruined by her reaction to my arrival. The moment the shil’vati girl caught sight, she came running toward me, full-tilt, long legs churning and ripping out any flowers that caught in the creases and joints of the ornate, pseudo-militaristic greaves of noble fashion.

I spread my arms out and charged in with them held out at my sides, even though it had only been a week since we’d last spent time together. All the pent-up tension of what I was about to ask and undertake cracked with the impact and us wrapping arms around each other, its wisps dissipating as the alien scent mixed with wildflowers filled in the broken container, and the sensation of her long nails tracing their way around the back of my neck drew out the last dregs. I found my chin pressed into her shoulder as she drained me of nervousness.

Spending forever like that sounded nice. I could see how people might lose themselves in a shil’vati’s arms with no greater aspirations than this.

She broke the moment first, pulling back to take me in as her mind ditched whatever lessons were being imparted via omni-pad and Morsh’s tutelage in favor of observing my unusual clothing. Well, unusual for me, at least.

“Going somewhere?”

“I might be,” I said cagily. “Mind if we take a walk for a bit?” Morsh cocked her head slightly to the side. “If it helps, please tell Lady Rakten that I would like to talk with her.”

Morsh took her order only when Natalie gave a dismissive wave. With the lesson now over, it seemed, the power had reverted to what the Shil’vati might have called ‘natural order.’

“What is it?” She asked, a nervousness cracking through her otherwise winsome smile. “Something’s up.”

“I’m uh,” I started, before my confidence finally broke. I’d pushed it as far as was wise, knowing full well where hubris had damn near taken me the last time I’d flown off on a half-cocked plan. “What can you tell me about Vanguard Academy?” At least this time I would get a tiny, little bit more information first, even if it felt like I wasn’t trusting of Gavin and Sullivan’s intel. They seemed to have come up with it rather suddenly, after all. What if there was something they’d missed?

Oh, sure, in the brief seconds I had spare, I’d tried researching via the omni-pad I’d been given, but I was clunky on the interface, and there was so much assumed knowledge and conflicting information that I concluded I was wasting my time by conceding to my uncertainties.

“Didn’t you look it up?” Natalie asked. A completely reasonable question, gesturing to the omni-pad shaped bulge in my bag, safely contained.

“You’re still my eyes and ears on the broader Shil’vati universe.”

More than once, I’d caught myself holding it like it might rear up and try to take a chunk out of me. Some holdover from the one time I had peeped back into the little keyhole through which I offered the rest of the galaxy to view a glimpse of Earth and myself. I’d seen so many licentious eyes staring right back through that tiny abyss that I’d been once-bitten-twice-shy about it ever since. No, I’d convinced myself that my life was chaotic and troublesome enough without opening that little [Pandora’s](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-was-pandoras-box-118577) Faraday Cage. Even if it made me look ungrateful for her gift.

“Which you haven’t even asked about.”

I’d told myself I’d worry about the galaxy later, forgetting that Earth was now ‘a part’ of that galaxy, no matter how much we all wanted it to very much not be. Trying to manipulate the outcome felt like it would be certain to change to whatever I didn’t want, just by observing it, in some weird sort of [Quantum Mechanics](https://i.imgur.com/jCmfIlC.jpeg) meets [Murphy’s Law](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/murphy-s-law) sort of way. Only now I was stepping into it, and I’d have to do that with my eyes open, observing and taking a measure of the infiniteness of space.

“Yeah. Sorry.” Already, I felt I should have asked and gotten from her all she could think to tell me days ago, and let whatever else she thought pertinent to mention come staggering along in fits and bursts, as so often her cultural lessons in the library back at Talay had gone.

No use crying over spilt milk, but would it have killed me to have sent her a text or two asking about it so I could digest it before taking the final plunge and running around the state, calling in every favor I had?

Probably.

Trying to get in, brush up on half-remembered academics, and research the thing I was trying so damn hard to get into had me feeling like I was building the road I was rolling along at highway speed. If the fear of failure hadn’t been there to motivate me, I wasn’t sure I’d have found it in me to keep going while knowing so little about the road I was on.

As it was, unhelpfully, I couldn’t even slow down. The time to apply was apparently *now.* Something that I was sure was completely coincidental with how it aligned to our new school year, which didn’t seem to align to Earth Years anymore.

The terrible thing about hindsight when it came to finally vaulting over the core of your anxiety was that you found yourself cursing your own inhibitions, only to become painfully aware of the true scope of your foolishness when coming down the other side.

Natalie sucked in a breath that did distracting things to the skin-tight outfit she wore in a time when I really, really needed to be paying attention. I managed to bring my eyes back up as she finished her first sentence, and the fact that I was missing pertinent information at last registered.

My ears managed to fill in the gaps of what I’d not gotten, though my eyes suddenly found themselves torn between looking *at* Natalie, or looking everywhere but at her- and certainly not meeting her eyes, which I’m sure were adorably inquisitive as to why my cheeks were burning. “Just uh, you know, the basics? I’m thinking about going there.”

“Elias,” she gave me the kind of tone that stopped all my foolishness dead in its tracks. This kind of chastisement was reserved for when I suggested something deeply inappropriate. “This isn’t the sort of place you can ‘think about going’ to. You have to work hard. Very hard. And there’s the matter of what the place is -”

Something about the seriousness of her let me get over my own awkwardness and knuckle down. I had to finish this, fast, before Morsh got back. “It has military secrets aboard, doesn’t it?”

The Shil’vati girl didn’t answer right away, weighing my odd question’s merits after probably having spun up some answer to gloss over the basics. And then calculating what damage I might do with such secrets, doubtless, and then whether it was worth lying, unfortunately.

“It would,” she admitted. “I’m uncomfortable with you going up there, though. At least, alone.”

So it was like that, then. Probably wanted to sit over my shoulder, then, and make sure I didn’t get the juicy tidbits. That, or caught. If I went down, after all, then she would too. Or maybe she genuinely cared. Had Amilita’s real son and Jacqueline returning affected me more than I’d thought? I’d been displaced twice, given sharp reminders that I was, in fact, a surrogate. A spare. A second best.

“Elias?” She asked, and I realized I’d made a fist and stopped listening again, this time for entirely separate reasons, and just in time to unclench and put back on my smile as Morsh led Lady Rakten to the backyard.

Well, whatever I’d missed, it would be my fault- and- of all people, there was General Amilita, who fixed me with a big smile. I’d already submitted my request. Surprise spoiled, then. Amilita must have read my next move.

Lady Rakten’s face was inscrutable. 

“Good Evening, Lady Rakten,” I greeted her first and kept my body posture slightly forward in a formal bow, both hands forward, palms out and to the side in a Shil’vati pose. I had learned long ago to swallow my pride and present as someone closer to what the shil’vati all hoped I would be.

After the requisite time and the slight signal of an almost royal nod, I stood straight again and came closer as she stepped back, and for once offered a more formal greeting to Amilita as well, as was customary for anyone in the company of a noble, though it would have been a grave breach of decorum to greet the commoner officer first.

The love of their military only extended so far, after all.

“I beseech you for your boon.”

The raised eyebrow was her practically screaming: *‘Oh?’* You just had to know her to realize that.

“I intend to attend Vanguard Academy,” I added. I dug into my backpack and pulled out the manilla envelope I’d stolen from my father’s filing cabinet, and handed it over. A week’s worth of frantically gathering signatures and more had produced a shockingly slim stack when compared to a year’s worth of notes, but I flipped through where I’d put the paper clips, one after another, announcing each’s recommendation.

The elegant matriarch didn’t make a pretense at expressing either surprise or hesitation, nor deign to recognize the Mayor or newly appointed senators’ signatures, waiting patiently for me to realize this and to sheepishly tuck it back away into my bag. What a waste of a week. Maybe worse, when I thought about the trouble we’d gone through to get most of them elected.

“I presume you intend to join my daughter. I’ve warned her to not let you become a distraction.”

So it was like that.

I could take the slight, or make her squirm in front of her friend. I had the whole family over a barrel.

Lady Rakten had already seen me- the *real* me. Braggadocious in my rapid string of victories that night, calculating and willing to send someone into the merciless clutches of the Interior. A statement that I was someone who knew their friends from their enemies.

Best not to tempt her to poking back. She might not know the full depth, but revealing to the General that I had connections to Myrrah that gave me some strange, undue sway over the impossible-to-nudge-off-course Interior Agent would be a world of trouble. That was the kind of influence that even a whole series of well-connected Noblewomen hadn’t been able to muster to save their own necks with all their credits, fame, and power. If nobles were to attend, maybe it would raise my station, but just as likely it’d cause Amilita to start second-guessing her support and impression of me. The former would be a mission failure that would compound to the insurgency’s aims, the latter would be a more personal disaster.

“Then I must ask for your…personal assistance as well.”

“Oh?” Her expression unfroze into one of moderate interest.

“Not to minimize what it takes, being a noble, a hero. I could not be a true noble in the limited time before classes commence, yet I might cover the worst, most damning gaps to ensure I do not embarrass you or your family name through association with me. When I search for tips, the DataNet assumes I already know so many things that come from a frame of reference that I do not share. Worse, disentangling rumors from truth is difficult as well as possible regional differences persisting. How do I know which to trust? In truth, there is one Noble family I trust above all. Even asking this to any other noble or Shil’vati is out of bounds. Would they invest in me if not to extract something in return, which would shame your family? I do not believe so, and so it is to you alone I must ask this.”

Tutoring, in other words. Just like Natalie had been getting. Begging for financial assistance felt like a bridge too far at this point- I was sure they wouldn’t want me indebted to anyone- such a position would be even more severe than getting advice on the DataNet, but why bundle up all my asks when I wasn’t even sure if it even charged tuition? [*Better to keep my mouth shut and be suspected a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.*](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/17/remain-silent/)

“Morsh!” Lady Rakten’s slender face turned to a slight leer.

The family bodyguard stepped into view, smiling as if Christmas had come early. “Help prepare the boy, too.”

“Prepare him?” Morsh asked, though it was to my surprise that she turned to Amilita instead of the Matriarch. “There’s one part that’s still a mystery, isn’t it? And if the instructions are remedial, there’s a difference unless he decides to Come Ashore.” The way she said it implied it was some sort of turn of phrase, rather than something literal. The word was also borrowed from High Shil’, which the scarred up bodyguard practically never spoke.

Morsh eyed me in a way that lacked the usual lustful glances a Shil’vati gave. This was far more analytical, the kind that a wary Marine at a checkpoint might give at the peak of the state’s tensions.

“I already received his request for a recommendation,” the General finally had dispensation to speak, even if it hadn’t been granted by the Lady. “I’m certain he’s already made up his mind, though.” Her smile was expectant.

“I…” I had to play coy. I didn’t know what she was talking about. What? I’d put in so much effort, but this certainly seemed damned important. What on earth had Gavin and Sullivan forgotten to tell me?

I felt Natalie’s hand on mine give it a squeeze- practically crushing it. We’d had barely a few seconds to talk about the place. Was she about to step in and rescue me from this?

“Well? Spit it out. Which branch? Marines, or Navy?”

*****

I'd outgrown my brain seizing up.

Instead, I used a word that had been drilled into me to stop me from target fixating on the bike: *Break now!*

And suddenly I could breathe.

With breath came several revelations, and a conclusion.

*“If* I get in…” I said, drawing out the moment and bringing everything to a crescendo, and quickly checking my mental math.

I needed to make a decision *now.* I could work on everything else later. Even choking Gavin and Sullivan for their obvious omission.

The Navy came with the accolades. Many of the top, most important nobles went into it. Cerebral decisions upon which the lives of billions might depend. Power ran through that.

I broke from looking at Lady Rakten, who actually did look a bit interested, over to Amilita’s broad and expectant face.

The Marines got the glory, though. Space was a later issue to focus on. For now the battle would be planetside, namely here on Earth. Whatever technologies, techniques, and anything else I’d pick up would have the most utility-

“Marines,” I answered, hoping the heartbeat hadn’t been too long to cross from suspense to

With a triumphant shout the General broke from where she stood to close the distance. I hadn’t even had time to calculate the obvious likelihood of a reaction, I was taken completely by surprise. I stepped on Natalie’s foot and bumped into her on some belated instinct to dodge, and before I could disentangle myself I was scooped up by under my arms and spun around, back and forth roughly as everyone started talking loudly at once.

Everyone was talking at once, and she set me down and fussed my hair, then gave me another big hug.

From where I could see, Lady Rakten was visibly calculating the effect of my answer, when Natalie jumped in. “Me too!”

“Nataliska!” Her mother snapped. “That is *not* what you have been training for.”

“I…” she took a breath. “I mean I can Leap Into Orbit, right?”

“That’s a lengthy process, rarely pulled off well,” Nive sounded doubtful, but Natalie took the lack of a ‘no’ as permission.

“Can I do it during training, then?”

“It will add to your training regimen,” Nive’s frown turned thoughtful. “If your grades stay good, and you’re alright with taking the extra time, then…well, I suppose,” she was clearly not thrilled with the prospect though, and seemed to narrow her eyes at me slightly. The smile she forced seemed a bit thin-lipped, given the otherwise happy moment.

“Didn’t think you had it in you,” Morsh had waited, and clapped me on the shoulder. “You should have said you were in the Navy, though, because I’m going to be your instructor.”

All I could do was smile stupidly. “Well, we don’t have too much time to waste, then, do we?”

# Deep House Music South Africa: The Heartbeat of Afro House Culture in 2025

Deep house music in South Africa is much more than a genre; it is a vibrant fusion combining traditional African rhythms with the dynamic energy of electronic dance music. From its roots in South African townships to becoming a global phenomenon, South African deep house is distinguished by its deep connection to African culture, politics, and identity. This article explores the house music genre in South Africa, its most influential artists, and the evolution of a sound that has captivated audiences worldwide.

## Evolution and Unique Features of Deep House in South Africa

South African deep house blends traditional house music with influences from Kwaito and traditional African music, especially African rhythms and soulful vocals that give it its characteristic essence. Pioneer artists such as Black Coffee, Euphonix, and emerging producers like Verdagris and Thorne Miller mix African instruments like saxophone and piano with modern synthesizers, creating a sound that ranges between 80 and 160 BPM, maintaining a hypnotic and emotional vibe. This fusion is not just musical but cultural, reflecting social and political messages that have accompanied the scene since the post-apartheid era.

This evolution has fueled a vibrant underground scene with DJs and producers bringing the music to festivals and clubs both in South Africa and on international stages, contributing to the global Afro house phenomenon.  

## Prominent Artists and Their Global Impact

Black Coffee stands as the most influential artist in this genre, having taken Afro house from Johannesburg clubs to major festivals like Coachella and Tomorrowland. Other notable talents include underground South African DJs like Vinny Da Vinci, Jullian Gomes, and Kid Fonque, who continue to shape the electronic dance music scene in South Africa.

Women have played a key role in this movement, with figures such as DJ Cndo, Bucie, and DJ Zinhle contributing significantly to the sound and culture of Afro house. The diversity and richness of South African deep house are reflected in its collaborations and rising popularity on global platforms like Beatport, where Afro house ranks as the fourth most searched genre worldwide.

## Cultural and Social Influences

South African deep house reflects the social and political realities of the country. Its development is linked to the post-apartheid context and the spirit of cultural resistance and freedom. In the townships, DIY production using tools like FruityLoops has enabled music to flourish independently, supported by informal distribution networks and community efforts.

Moreover, the music accompanies communal celebrations and parties, serving as a vehicle for important social and political messages in South African identity. African rhythms, singing in local languages, and influences from Kwaito further strengthen this connection.

It emerged as a blend of global house music styles with traditional African rhythms and Kwaito from the townships, as a form of cultural expression and resistance during and after apartheid.

My boyfriend was the one who pursued me starting the beginning of October. It was really passionate and fun, we have a lot of the same interests, we love watching movies together and we're highly sexually compatible. He lives around the corner and would try to see me and sleep over pretty often. He then said he wanted the relationship to become serious, so we became official around Nov 5th. I tend to be a bit insecure in the beginning of relationships and I think he thought I was the cool one, so slowly my image changed I think. I would have talks with him about the relationships and boundaries, never anything super serious and I never got mad, but I think he didnt love the talks. 
Around the same time we got together he started a job as a store manager that made him work a ton of hours, very early shifts (1-4am) and he'd be exhausted. He would have the days free but he needed most days to recharge and be alone after a while. He would sometimes visit me for a couple of hours saying he needed affection but then would leave, so I would ask why he would leave so early when he lives just around the corner. But he was tired. That was my bad. 

Eventually he would stop by less and less and stay home napping and just getting his alone time in. This made me feel a little insecure since he lived so close, why not see me even for a bit? So I would bring it up more often than I'd like to admit and it mightve pushed him away. I told him and I like him just as much as I did at the start of the relationship and he said he did too, but I probably came off as very insecure. But his personality type/ behavior kinda made me feel that way, so maybe we are mismatched in that area. 

I took him out to dinner last week and it was really nice.  We have plans to make a long drive back home for Thanksgiving next week (not spending it together but our hometowns are close to each other) and other plans in the future as well. But this past weekend he didnt stop by to visit me once (Fri - Sun) then he canceled our sleepover on Monday (he still came over and stayed late but said he wanted to wape up inbhis own bed on his day off for the first time in a long time) This of course made me think and it led to a phone call on Sunday that made him pretty frustrated. After that, his entire tone changed. This whole week hes been texting me coldly - constantly updating me about what hes doing, sending me selfies even, but he dropped the pet names. For a month it was ""good morning handsome"" ""good night boyfriend"" ""sorry bf"" but this week its just ""morning"" ""gn"" and in general a lot less enthusiasm. 

Ive decided to respond to him as I normally would, still using his pet names but he isnt mirroring me. I'm convinced he might break up with me after the thanksgiving drive since we're already locked in for that. But he does talk about spending time together in December positively,  so it could be my paranoia.

I just find it way too soon for him to be acting so coldly when just last week he was being so cute and fun in his messages. The honeymoon phase is supposed to be several months but he already seems used to me and not very excited to come over. He did reach out to see me for coffee on Tuesday and then for a walk on Wednesday, but very short. His dad is visiting this week from out of town so he has little time, which is fine. At the end of those short hang outs he did peck me and said bye bf, and he did call me bf twice yesterday, but his tone is still withdrawn. 

It makes me sad because I know this was my fault and I ruined it. I plan on working on myself and trusting his word more and not having heavy relationship talks for a long time, especially about him needing his space. I want to give him all the space he wants. I just hope it isnt too late to salvage. What do you guys think? I know if he sticks through it we are going to be great together, I just hope hes not thinking of ending things already.",1,1763732270.0,gayrelationships,1,1.0,False

(2014) We’ve met due to another friend, so we met up in a bar. Of course I was nervous but he made me feel at home. We talked about our past experiences. Over time we talked—and fell in love. We did have breaks due to us not being ready to be together yet. Until July 17th we officially started to be together.
 
Overtime everything was official. He treated me amazing, pure out of his heart. He always gave me flowers, sweet texts, and was there on my worse days. He was everything I’ve ever hoped for since I had bad relationships in the past, he took me in with loyalty and trust.

Flash forward now. I still question our past. I shouldn’t care but I do. I’ve seen red flags but I didn’t want to believe them. Before we broke up in 2020, there was off days between me and him. I want to share the weird things he’s done.

When me and him were watching a movie. He would be texting beside me, but made sure his phone was tilted away from my view. When I got up, he fixed his posture to straight again. I didn’t think of it, but it lingered in my mind. I was scared to question since he always gets defensive.

He’s a traveler. He’s go visits other states. He usually brings his best friend which isn’t a problem since me and her got along years ago. But I found three tickets to Florida, and I wonder who the other ticket belonged to. (Which was found in the living room on the table) it was in the open. I asked, “Are you bringing another friend?” He just looked at me irritated and told me, “yeah, why is it your business? Why are you snooping around my stuff anyway?” I wasn’t trying too but they were laid out on the coffee table. I was curious, and he never treated me that poor before.

So I was alone those few days. On social media there was another man beside him, I didn’t know him at all. I tried to shake it off that’s just a new friend but something was off. 

After that there wasn’t anything of that guy again. When he arrived home after a week, i decided to ask him questions once he’s comfortable at home. When I asked who that guy was, D replied, “Oh, he was an old co-worker. We got back talking.” I believed him. He didn’t hesitate either.  D always remained irritated with me  every-time I questioned. 

I realized he used to leave frequently. Hiding his phone, and acting aggressive towards me. I was tired and wasn’t feeling happy in this relationship anymore. Being an influencer, I felt drained to even continue posting. This man was supposed to be my lover for life, somebody to help me. He helped me produce a show that meant a lot, only to take every credit as if he created it. It was like he despised me. Which yes we have arguments but I always fixed it, so did he. Now he shifts everything on me.

I broke up with him and he lashed out blaming me. He didn’t care to even fix things, he left and I cried for hours. Few months, my friend showed me a photo of D and that old co-worker constantly posting about each other. I didn’t see to care since I moved on, but it keeps in mind all the red flags I’ve seen…

It gained popularity after a trade show appearance in China, selling out on JD.com and Taobao, but reviews are mixed, and scientific backing for its alertness claims is weak.

Hey all. This has probably been Beaten to death but the more I research the more I’m getting conflicting information. I just bought a decent espresso machine (Lelit Victoria $999) after coming from a Nespresso Virtuo for the last 4 years. I figured since I have an espresso every morning for the gym I should get a good machine and dump the daily 1-2$ cost of those pods. I have the machine dialed in decently but my 40$ Amazon grinder leaves everything to be desired. One click it does magnificent 30 second pulls, next click finer…no coffee. Next click coarser…5second pulls. I have it dialed in on that one click but it seems like I probably should get a better grinder that can offer at least some ability to dial in further and more accurately. If I change beans I have to use a different number altogether. The more research I do the more confused I’m getting. I just want a grinder that will help me make a nice full chocolaty espresso, I don’t think I need one that releases fruity notes of light coffee etc. I do one double shot at a time and that’s it so single serving is fine.

Here is the fix.,"We need to be honest: Most physical DAOs (like Coffee DAOs) have failed. Why? Because we overcomplicated them. We tried to put every decision - from buying milk to fixing the toilet - on the blockchain.

But the goal of a DAO shouldn't be to reinvent management. The goal is simple: **Take capital ownership away from Banks and VCs and move it into the hands of the middle class.**

I’ve been brainstorming a ""Manager-First"" DAO model that bridges the gap between a traditional LLC and Web3. I want to roast/test this idea with you all.

**The ""Manager-First"" Model** Imagine I want to open a coffee shop, but I don’t have $50k.

* **The Old Way:** I go to a bank (high interest) or a VC (they take 50% equity + control).
* **The DAO Way:** I write a business plan and post it here.

**How it works mechanically:**

1. **Crowdfunding:** We do a token presale for $50k. This represents, say, 49% of the profit rights. I (the operator) keep 51% (or similar split) so I have ""skin in the game.""
2. **The Legal Wrapper:** I take that USDT, off-ramp it, and register a standard LLC. I sign a lease and buy equipment.
3. **Centralized Operations:** I run the shop. I hire baristas. I buy beans. I don't ask the DAO permission to buy oat milk.
4. **On-Chain Governance (High Level Only):** The DAO only votes on big issues: *Should we expand to a second location?* or *Should we distribute dividends vs. reinvest in a new espresso machine?*
5. **Profit Distribution:** When the shop makes a profit, I pay taxes legally, then use the remaining cash to buy back the DAO token or send USDC to the treasury.

**The ""Trust"" Solution (The Open Book)** How do you know I’m not lying about expenses?

* We use **Open Book Software**: Every receipt and income entry is logged publicly.
* **Daily Hashing:** At the end of each day, the software hashes the log and anchors it to the blockchain. I can't go back and edit last week's numbers without breaking the chain.
* **Audits:** We don't need trust; we need verification. An independent auditor (incentivized by the DAO) can spot-check the physical shop against the digital logs.

**The Elephant in the Room: ""But that's a Security!""** I know. In the US, this likely fails the Howey Test. But hear me out:

1. **Laws are not Physics:** Laws are made by people and they can be changed. The only reason the SEC cracks down is that we haven't built a model that works safely yet.
2. **The Meme Coin Hypocrisy:** Retail investors are losing millions daily on meme coins with zero utility. Why is it ""legal"" to gamble on a dog coin, but ""illegal"" to crowdfund a coffee shop that actually generates revenue?

We are trying to build a blueprint for decentralized franchises. A model where 1,000 people pitching in $50 is better than one bank loaning $50k.

**Roast me:** What breaks this model? Why hasn't this worked yet?",1,1763731283.0,dao,2,1.0,False

1p2yf6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1p2yf6o/420_days_streak_and_going_on/,420 Days Streak and going on,"Dear all,  
  
A bit of background on me. I am 37 years and 8 months old. Grew up in Asia. Had a traumatic and abusive childhood. Got used by the servant for his pleasure(No penetration), just fondling. Constant touching of genitals and nipples growing up. Learnt about masturbation at the age of 6. Had been ejaculating regularly till the age of 36. Previous streak was 6 months last year. Current streak is 420 days. 

Got severley addicted to masturbation and used to stay aloof with poor emotional regulation with family members. Was shy to talk to girls at school. Severe impulsivity, anxiety, anger issues growing up. Had irregular eating habits. Poor physique. Thin bones , less muscles. Constantly used to check myself in the mirror. A lot of fantasizing about school teachers and school crushes. 

Mother(passed away 12 years ago) was the man of the house. Father is an addict. He lost multiple jobs. Feels like he is too naive and people used him for money. Moreover, he gives a very cowardly look and just sits in the window gazing outside the house. I feel pathetic looking at him and have already had several fights with him. I have also swore(pretty disgusting words) at him. 

Currently live in europe for the past 10 years. Lost my virginity at the age of 28 with a woman who approached me. Mostly did not have the guts to talk to women. But all my hook ups have been initiated by the woman. 

  
Previous streak of 6 months:

Was in a on-off dating scene with this girl. She came across as a succubi. But I too was immature as most of my relationships were long-distance. Always used to fantasize about us having sex but in reality never felt like that with her. Maybe, I was not so used to handle real intimate relationship. Started the streak on 31st Dec 2023 as I saw I was having alopecia areata (hair fall condition). 

During the streak, i gave up alcohol(once in two months). No coffee, artificial sugar and PMO. Also, during this time, felt random blisss twice, cleaner mind but still bouts of anger against father and aunt (who used to drag and lock me inside a dark room for misbhaving). Voluntarily decided to relapse on 30th Junne 2024. Had the chaser effect for the next three months. Simultaneously, lost the interest in the girl I was dating. 

  
Current Streak: Start on 29.09.2024

During this streak, felt no major differences, except some random blissful moments. Moreover, confronted my father for molesting me as a child and my aunt for locking me inside the dark room. 

Some Habits I follow:  
  
1. intermittent fasting ( mood dependent)

2. Talking to random girls on the street , just so that I get used to the female nature a bit more.

3. Exercise 5 days a week.

4. I read a lot and try to apply what i read, in daily life.

Changes I Noticed:   
  
POSITIVES

1. Better skin

2. Pink Nails

3. Rear skull shape change

4. Cleaner mind

5. Heightened Awareness

6. Heavier voice

7. Stronger Gaze

8. Small criticisms do not faze me.

9. Increased risk taking behavior at work.

10. Less hunger ( 2 meals a day)

11. Can workout for 2.5 hours at the gym and still have energy

12. Notice women looking at me ( but i do not know if in a positive or Negative way), probably because i am brown skinned living amongst white skinned people.

13. I look 10 years younger, almost everyone says that.

14. I walk slowly and decreased compulsive head movement.

15. I have faced heightened sense of limerence during blissful days.

16. I have lost interest in music, dancing, futsal during winter (I prefer football).

17. Slight increase in memory retention.

18. My diarrhoea has gone away permanently. Always have hard sausage like stool unless i have constipation.

19. Genitals have more vigor and verve to them. 

20. My spine cracks a lot.

21. My left jaw tension has increased during night sleep and I crack it as soon as i get up.

22. Alopecia has gone away. However I do face hair fall, maybe due to stress. 

NEGATIVES

1. Increase in left jaw tension

2. I feel saturated by self improvement.

3. I hardly have friends except at work ( 1 or 2 guys).

4. I feel the need for connection but i do not feel like talking to my family.

5. I am quite judgemental because of negative experiences and Do not feel like adding new habits as I do not get the results I expect. 

6. I am at an age, where I should be dating or at least getting married but reading and watching a lot of podcasts about women, dating , money, I guess I am overanalyzing my life. 

7. My spontaneity exists but there aren't many people to share that with. 

8. I overthink my interactions with women and I would like to talk to them at a human level.

9. I wake up at the middle of the night and get these bouts of loneliness, where the mind says, you are too old, you are alone, you will never get a woman that you like. But then I think I so not want the woman who my family chooses ( maybe my egoistical nature), but I do believe if I am not physically attracted to her, what is the point. Also I do not want to seek any help from family members as they have helped me a lot financially and I feel like a loser if i get their help. 

10. Biggest negative factor : my mind is very insecure, I am very insecure about the way i look and try to make up for lost health and intelelct. But then I face the problem of age and running out of time. 

  
Summary :  I want to self improve but at what cost. If my loved ones are not there to see me develop, what is the point of self improvement. But if i do not sel-improve , i will not be happy amongst loved ones. Your suggestions will be helpful. Pardon my grammar. i did not proof read as that way you will get a sense of how my brain works.

1p2yatd,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1p2yatd/ang_bait_talaga_ng_kaklase_ko/,Ang bait talaga ng kaklase ko,"
Kanina nag-take kami ng exam sa isang major subject namin since magiging super busy na siya next week and lalo na next month. After ng exam, sobrang saya ko kasi halos lahat ng ni-review ko lumabas talaga sa test! Mas masaya pa ako kasi yung irreg kong blockmate, na tinulungan ko mag-review, pumasa rin at halos lahat ng pinag-aralan namin lumabas din. Masaya ako kasi lahat ng natutunan ko sa subject na put ko na in-practice and I can say na effective kasi may natutunan yung classmate ko, pwede na ako maging teacher eme

Pagkatapos ng exam, sinabi niya sa akin na ililibre daw niya ako bilang thank you. Sa una, tumanggi ako kasi nahiya ako– hindi naman din kasi kami super close. Pero nag-insist talaga siya, kaya sabi ko, “Kahit yung tinapay na may palaman tapos choco drink sa coffee machine, okay na yun.” HAHAHA

Pero ayaw niya. Sabi niya, “’Wag yun, may mas masarap pa dun lol”
Next thing I know, dinala na niya ako sa mall… tapos bigla kaming pumasok sa JCO.

Doon na ako nanigas.
Like, hala baka di ako pwede dito?!
Hindi ko na plantsa blouse ko, tas madumi pa sapatos ko. Mukha akong naligaw sa sosyal na lugar HAHAHA

Sabi niya, “Pili ka na.”
Sagot ko, “Kung ano kukunin mo, yun na rin sakin, first time ko dito haha”
Ayun, nag-order na siya tapos nagkwentuhan kami habang hinihintay yung order. Yung in-order niya parang malamig na Milo pero parang mas matapang yung lasa? Tapos donut na may white na palaman, hindi ko alam yung pangalan guys, wag nyo ako i-judge HAHAHA. Pero legit masarap.

She comes from a well-off family, pero super bait, super humble and hindi kagaya sa  iba kong classmates na same background sa kanya pero ang tataas ng tingin sa sarili. Unlike them, She treats everyone nicely kahit sino ka pa.

Thank you po again A! I hope you never stop being kind! 🩷

1p2yano,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1p2yano/st_thomas_nevada_was_flooded_in_1938_every_year/,"St. Thomas, Nevada was flooded in 1938. Every year it rises again… and it keeps what it catches.","The Town That Refuses to Drown

We were supposed to be celebrating.

Third-year med school was finally over. Four of us—me, Elena, Jonah, and Priya—had fled Las Vegas with cheap tents, cheaper beer, and the kind of bone-deep exhaustion that only finals can carve into you. Lake Mead was mostly desert now, a cracked white graveyard of what used to be water. The perfect place to disappear for one night before residency swallowed the rest of our lives.

We picked a spot halfway between the bones of Callville Bay marina and the bathtub ring that circled the lake like a scar. Far enough from the highway that the only light came from the stars. Jonah, our structural-engineering tag-along who still swore the reservoir would “refill any day,” kicked the dry silt and declared it solid. “Just compaction,” he said. “Nothing’s moving down there.”

Elena laughed and kissed me while we wrestled with tent poles. Her hair smelled like hospital soap and hot wind. She whispered that after this trip we should pick a city, pick a life, finally live together. I said yes before she finished the sentence.

We drank. We took stupid pictures on the dry lakebed. Around 2 a.m. the wind quit entirely and the silence pressed in like wet cotton. That was when we saw the lights.

Not stars. Lower. A soft amber glow on the horizon, the color of porch bulbs left on for children who never came home.

Jonah thought it was a rave. Priya thought Border Patrol. Elena thought it was beautiful.

By sunrise the town was simply there.

Brick buildings two stories tall, laid out in a perfect grid. A white clapboard church with a steeple that caught the light like bone. A Texaco station with round pumps and glass globes no one had made since the fifties. A diner whose neon sign buzzed PIONEER CAFÉ though there wasn’t a power line for fifty miles. Telephone wires hummed between poles that stood straight and proud. The air smelled like wet cottonwood and river water, impossible in the middle of the Mojave in June.

And people. Hundreds of them on the sidewalks in feed-sack dresses and suspenders and newsboy caps, waving like we were family coming home from war.

A woman in a calico dress and sunbonnet stepped forward. She looked thirty, maybe, but her eyes belonged to something that had watched canyons form.

“Welcome to St. Thomas,” she said. “You’re right on time. Call me Mrs. Whitmore.”

Elena’s hand found mine and squeezed until the bones ground together.

We tried to leave the instant the sun cleared the ridges.

Jonah reached his truck first. The hood was warm, but the key turned and turned and did nothing. Priya sprinted back the way we’d come; the tire tracks ended at a white picket fence that hadn’t existed the night before. A hand-painted sign leaned against it: WELCOME HOME.

Jonah punched through the fence in his truck. Wood exploded in every direction—and the truck rolled to a gentle stop in someone’s front yard, lake water glugging from the tailpipe.

Elena and I ran east toward open desert we could still see shimmering. The faster we ran, the farther the horizon slid away, until we stood panting on the courthouse lawn while Mrs. Whitmore watered petunias in impossible colors.

“Running burns calories,” she said pleasantly. “Breakfast is almost ready.”

We met in the middle of Main Street, four panting, sunburned idiots in yesterday’s clothes, surrounded by people who smiled like they’d waited decades for this exact moment.

That was when Jonah lost it.

He charged the nearest porch, grabbed a little boy by the suspenders, and screamed, “Where’s the goddamned road?”

The boy looked up with perfect calm. “You’re home now, mister.”

Mrs. Whitmore appeared beside them, faster than anyone that age should move. “Jonah, dear, we don’t hurt children here.”

He laughed, wild, as if tempting to burst the vein in his forhead and snatched a polished double-barrel shotgun that he had on his tailgate. He racked it once and leveled it at the child’s head.

“Then let us fucking go.”

The street went still. Even the wind quit.

Mrs. Whitmore sighed the way a mother sighs when her toddler throws peas and raised one hand.

The shotgun exploded in Jonah’s grip. Barrels peeled open like a steel flower, shrapnel ripping through his throat and chest in a red mist. He dropped without a sound, knees first, then face-down in dust already turning to mud.

Priya screamed. Elena dropped beside him, hands pressing the ruin of his neck, shouting for a trauma kit that didn’t exist yet. Blood pulsed between her fingers in thick, hopeless ropes. I stood frozen, smelling gunpowder and pennies.

Mrs. Whitmore knelt, smoothed Jonah’s hair back from his forehead, and whispered, “There, there. First time’s always the hardest.”

The townspeople began to sing. Soft. An old hymn I half-remembered from childhood. “Shall We Gather at the River.”

Three hundred and sixty-four days later the sirens sang, the water rose, and Jonah walked out of the church smiling, shirt crisp and clean, no mark on him, calling us lazy for sleeping in.

The calendar on the diner wall never flips past 1936, but we remember every loop. The town learns. After Jonah complained, a single glowing router appeared behind the counter—password pioneer1935. The movie palace started running films that haven’t been shot yet. Elena opened a clinic; the medicine works better than physics should allow. People still break legs, still deliver babies, still die when the flood comes—only to stand up smiling the next morning when the streets are dry again.

They’re happy.

Jonah married a girl who drowned at nineteen in 1938. Priya teaches school and has three children whose parents walked away decades ago and never looked back. No one ages. Children stay children. The old stay old. Elena and I stay twenty-six.

I’m the only one still trying to leave.

The first year I was polite about it. Walked west at dawn with a canteen and a map. Eight hours later I stepped out from behind the Texaco station, boots full of the same red dust. Mrs. Whitmore handed me lemonade like I’d been gone five minutes.

The second year I got angry. Stole a rowboat, rowed until my palms split. The lake narrowed into a river, the river into a creek, the creek into a puddle, and then I glided under the Pioneer Café’s front window while Priya waved from a booth.

The third year I tried science. Jonah helped me build a drone from parts the hardware store suddenly stocked. We flew it north until it was a speck. The feed showed real desert, Highway 93, cars. Then the drone turned around on its own and landed on the courthouse lawn. The memory card held one still image: four empty chairs around our usual diner table.

Year four I tried dying. Slit my wrists in the claw-foot tub on Bonelli Street. The water ran red, then pink, then clear. I woke in clean sheets with Elena stroking my hair, whispering, “We don’t do that here, love.”

Year five I tried forgetting. Drank peach brandy that tasted like every good summer I ever had. Let Elena love me until I couldn’t remember why I wanted out. It worked for three hundred and sixty-four days. On the morning of the flood I was standing at the edge again, shoes in hand, note already written.

I stopped counting after that.

Every method just teaches the town a new, gentler way to bring me home. The paths loop. The water forgives. The dead smile and offer pie. Love grows roots through your ribs while you’re not looking and then asks, very politely, why you keep trying to tear your own heart out.

Nothing works until the flood.

Last cycle I almost made it. When the sirens began and the water rose, I ran for the edge where desert should have been. I felt dry air, saw headlights on Highway 93. Then Elena tackled me, sobbing into my shirt. “Just one more year,” she begged. “Stay with me.”

I stayed.

This time I won’t.

The sirens will start in eleven minutes. I can smell the river already.

Elena is asleep in our little house on Bonelli Street, hair fanned across the pillow like spilled ink. Jonah and Priya are at the church social, dancing to music that won’t exist for seventy years.

I left a note on the kitchen table. Told her I love her. Told her I’m sorry. Told her some stories aren’t meant to loop forever.

I’m walking away from Elena’s sleeping face, from Jonah laughing at a joke he’s told a thousand times, from children who will never see a new year.

Behind me, St. Thomas is singing—hundreds of voices raised calm and glad, ready for the wave that kills them and saves them at once.

I don’t look back.

If you find this—if this note washes up on some future shore with my name still legible—listen:

Don’t trust the town that refuses to drown.

They’ll smile and pour you coffee that never cools, and eternity tastes sweet until you realize the cup never empties and the door only opens inward.",4,1763730879.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

We’ve launched **AroundU 3 months ago**, built right here in the city, and honestly, the response has been wild. Tons of people are already hosting runs, coffee meetups, house parties, study groups, board-game nights, F1 screenings… all by actual users, not random spammy “events”.

And before someone says Meetup exists, yeah, but let’s be real:  
You can’t host anything meaningful on Meetup unless you pay a subscription. And even then, all you see there now are webinars, seminars, and corporate workshops. The fun, spontaneous, local stuff? Dead.

That’s why we built AroundU:  
A place where anyone can host or join something instantly. No fees, no drama, no begging friends to show up. If you have an idea, a chai run, a badminton match, a midnight drive just start a lobby and people join.

We’re also rolling out a bunch of features that make this way more exciting than anything out there, can't wait for you to try it out

Try it out and tell me what you think, good, bad, whatever. We’re building this for the city, and it’s only getting better from here.

I've also realized 2 weeks before this happened i had a BIG panic attack, i thought i had skin cancer and i literally remember crying and fixating on it so much like i generally thought i was gonna die i was like crying to my parents. But for some reason i STILL cant believe this is going on, This goes on all day, There have been a few days where i havent fixated on it or looked at it and it hasnt happened, and the pain usually stops after 15-30 minutes, sometimes if i fixate on it itll just start off with small pressure, then pain, back to pressure, then pain then stop when i stop fixating on it.

I can't take it. The constant reminder I am a deficient thing, the self-humilation ritual. I've done it all. Apps? Not a single match. Talking to people in person? Been there, bars, coffee shops, the gym, meet up activities. Every time the same thing. I chat with women, have a descent conversation, ask for their number, and generally respectfully get told ""no, sorry"". Im not off-putting in conversation or weird. I have pretty strong social skills. I read cues, if she isn't into the conversation I make a gracefull exit, if she is I press on. But it always ends the same. I know Im atleast someone charming because I almost never get hostile rejections or reactions of disgust. Its always just ""nice talking to you but no"". Which is fair on its own. But a lifetime of it has just ruined me mentally. Dating and single events? Same things. Good conversation and interactions. But in the end, I've never had a single match. Im just hideous, and that's all there is to it. I make good money, have traveled the world. I have hobbies, go to concerts, I have skills, I read, I work out 4 to 5 days a week, I can cook and take care of myself. I dont listen to weird alt-right podcasts, people generally think Im funny, I don't sit around playing video games all day (unless a new one came out I really want to play) or watching streamers. Im the opposite of a home body. I spend most of my time out and about doing things and seeing things. Im not boring. And I do all that because I want to. Not to try and draw women. I live what so many would consider a full life, and I know so many people who are jealous of what I have. I have my youth, money, freedom, time, hobbies, experiences, career and health. But none of it matters. I still feel empty. All the things your friends tell you to do, that people online tell you to do, that women tell you to do. None of it matters if your just straight up ugly. I see and hear people talk about dating, or sex, or whatever it may be and I want to die. I'd give up everything I have in my life for that. I'd trade it all. I never had a chance, despite everything Im just viewed as an evolutionary dead end. Malformed and unwanted. No amount of effort can ever overcome being born wrong. My existence is an error. So I give up. I will continue doing the things I like to do. I won't stop. But I will never be a whole person. I will always be just a vestige of one, I will leave this world alone, and unwanted despite all my efforts. And before you even say it, yes I see a therapist. But they can't fix this. Noone can. It was predetermined the moment I entered this world. I will never be wanted, I am too wrong for that. ",7,1763730470.0,Adulting,32,0.63,False

If I didnt answer a chat in five minutes, there was a comment. If I blocked time for deep work, I would get a message asking why my status was on busy. My tickets were always done, but it felt like no matter what I did I was behind some invisible standard. At some point I started to believe it. Maybe I really was slow, maybe everyone else was doing twice as much and I just could not see it through the screen.

This spring they announced we were going hybrid, three days in the office. The official line was that it would ""boost productivity and collaboration"". I was low key terrified, because if I was already seen as underperforming at home, I imagined it would be even more obvious in person. First week in the office was a shock, but not for the reason I expected. A huge part of the team spent half the day on coffee runs, smoke breaks, long chats in the kitchen. People disappeared for forty minutes because ""the line at the cafe was crazy"". Meetings started late because someone was still microwaving lunch. I was sitting there doing the same thing I always did at home, just with more noise around, and suddenly I realized I was not the lazy one at all.

Now when my manager hints that I should ""show more presence"", I push back. I point at finished work, not at how many times I walked past his desk. I even told him once that if I took as many breaks as some folks, he would really see a drop in my output.

1p2y2pz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1p2y2pz/another_formulation_of_the_logical_evil_problem/,Another formulation of the logical evil problem,"Why does Classical Theism have no God?

1)On the logical impossibility of the existence of libertarian free will (LFW)

(S1) You do what you do in any situation, the way you are.

(S2) In order to be ultimately responsible for what you do, you need to be ultimately responsible for the way you are, at least in some important mental respects.

(S3) But in no way can you be ultimately responsible for the way you are.

(S4) That is, you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.

Another formulation:

(S1) When I make the choice as a result of my desires, it seems like I have free will.

(S2) But I don't want my desires to be wanted, I don't want my desires to be wanted, I don't want my desires to be wanted, I don't want my desires to be wanted... need to.

(S3) In this case, either I am my own cause. So I'm not created. Or I have created myself out of absence. These 2 results are logically impossible.

p: God is the creator of everything.

q: God is not the creator of LFW.

Since p = -p, p \^ q = p \^ -p = 0.

2)Reformulating the logical evil problem

(S1a) God is completely good.

(S1b) God has infinitely high morality.

(S1c) God is infinitely powerful.

(S1d) God is infinitely knowledgeable.

(S2a) God gave the first factors to the universe.

(S2b) There is evil. (Religious texts, experiences...)

(S2c) God knew that the first factors would deterministically lead to evil.

(S2d) God could have prevented evil by changing the first factors. But he didn't prevent it.

(S3) (S1a,b,c,d)\^(S2a,b,c,d) = 0. Therefore, God does not exist.

3)Objections and replies to objections

3.1)The God is timeless argument

This argument doesn't change anything because the initial factors would deterministically change the universe.

3.2)God put LFW in the first factors and created the universe according to him, because he knew what we would do freely with his intermediate knowledge (molinism Let LFW(x) be, let x = final character;

LFW(a) = He would drink coffee freely at 9 o'clock. LFW(b) = He would not be able to drink coffee freely at 9 o'clock.

Even if God chooses LFW(a) here, this solution is still not valid. Because God is the one who grounds/chooses a.

If LFW(?) = a, then LFW(¿) = ? will be →. This goes on forever. Therefore, this defense is logically impossible. So, in order for me to drink that coffee freely at 9 o'clock, ∞ steps have to be taken. Or I have to be the first cause. Both of these are logically impossible.

3.3)Spiritual development defense

This is a weak argument. The evolutionary evil argument and the animal evil argument refute this. Also, according to most Theologies, animals do not have souls.

3.4)Skeptical Theism

This defense (S1a,b,c,d) makes my arguments ambiguous. That's why I don't think it would be the right choice. Such a God cannot be trusted.

3.5)Fideism (Revelation is superior to reason.)

This argument is also very weak. Because fideism will either lead to arbitrary religious exclusivism or religious pluralism. Arbitrary religious exclusivism is not a serious position. Religious pluralism is very weak. Because the normative moral rules of different religions contradict each other. If Buddhists say do not eat animals and Muslims say you can eat animals, there will be a conflict here.

3.6)The perpetrator's defense of causation

(S1) A perpetrator (A) ""chooses"" to perform action X at time t.

(S2) If A's choice of X is not due to A's previous states (his character, desires, beliefs) (which the Deceptive Causality claims), then there is no necessary connection between the choice of X and A's current state.

(S3) If there was no necessary connection, it was entirely possible for A to choose Y instead of X.

(S4) But why did X happen rather than Y, when all the conditions (inside and outside A) were the same?

(S5) The Pro-Agent Causality advocate says, ""Because the Agent wanted it that way.""

(S6) Rebuttal: This is not an explanation. The question ""Why did he want it that way?"" is asked again.

a) If there is a reason (because she liked X more), then we return to determinism (character).

b) If there is no reason, this choice is random (arbitrary).

1p2y1ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1p2y1ah/how_to_build_a_morning_routine_that_makes_you/,"How to build a morning routine that makes you BULLETPROOF (yes, even if you're not a morning person)","Everyone thinks successful people are “morning people”. But most of them weren’t born that waythey \*trained\* for it. What’s really happening? People are overexposing themselves to TikTok skits of 5 AM billionaires, ice baths, and perfectly aesthetic journaling sessions that look more like set designs than real life. Behind the scenes, most people hit snooze 3 times, doomscroll, and then panic-rush into the day wondering why their brain feels like mashed potatoes.

This post is not about those unrealistic routines. It’s a research-backed breakdown of what actually workscurated from top-tier books, peer-reviewed studies, and podcasts with legit experts, not self-proclaimed “ceos of their bedroom”. If you've ever felt like chaos is winning before 9 AM, this one's for you.

Here’s the bulletproof (and BS-proof) way to build a morning routine that actually boosts focus, reduces anxiety, and makes your mind WORK like it should:

\- Wake-up time matters less than \*\*wake-up consistency\*\*. According to Harvard Medical School’s Division of Sleep Medicine, the key to reliable energy is a consistent wake-up timeeven on weekends. This stabilizes your circadian rhythm, which regulates everything from digestion to mood.

\- Light is your real alarm clock. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman explains on the \*Huberman Lab Podcast\* that getting sunlight in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking boosts dopamine and cortisol in a \*good\* way. Cortisol in the morning = alertness. Cortisol at night = insomnia. Aim for at least 5–10 minutes outside or near a window.

\- Drink water before coffee. When you wake up, you're already dehydrated and your brain's running on fumes. According to the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, even mild dehydration can impair mood, memory, and attention. Hydrate first, caffeinate second.

\- Avoid your phone for the first 30 minutes. Dopamine researcher Dr. Anna Lembke (author of \*Dopamine Nation\*) notes that grabbing your phone first thing hijacks your reward system and leads to more scattered focus. The first thing you interact with programs your brain's baseline for the rest of the day.

\- Movement is non-negotiable. You don’t need a full workout. A brisk 10-minute walk or a few rounds of mobility/stretching signals to your body that it’s time to be awake. A study from the \*British Journal of Sports Medicine\* found that light morning movement improved cognition and working memory all day.

\- One minute of mindfulness > 20 minutes of doomscrolling. Studies from UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research Center show that even 60 seconds of intentional breathing helps reduce morning anxiety and sets a calmer tone for decision-making.

\- Pick ONE anchor habit. Don’t build a 15-step morning routine all at once. Atomic Habits author James Clear recommends starting with one keystone behaviorlike journaling, stretching, or reading for 5 minutes. That one win builds momentum. If you try to do everything, you’ll end up doing nothing.

\- Prep the night before. Professionals don’t “decide” in the morning. You decide at night. Lay out clothes, plan your breakfast, set your alarms. According to \*Thinking, Fast and Slow\* by Daniel Kahneman, decision fatigue hits hard in the morning. Eliminate friction.

\- Eat real food before sugar or nothing. No breakfast is fine if you’re intermittent fasting \*on purpose\*. But skipping food because you’re late leads to crashes and impulsive eating. Balanced breakfasts (protein + fat + fiber) stabilize blood sugar, shown in data from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

\- Don’t aim for perfect. Aim for repeatable. A study from Stanford’s Behavior Design Lab found that people are most consistent with routines that feel “too easy to fail.” So keep your expectations low, but your consistency high. Build reps, not rituals.

Building a powerhouse morning routine isn’t about aesthetic vlogs or 4 AM gym sessions. It’s about creating a sequence of low-resistance behaviors that compound. When done right, your morning doesn’t just “optimize” your dayit \*protects\* you from the chaos, anxiety, and distractions waiting to hijack your brain.

You don’t need a miracle morning. You just need a \*repeatable one\*.",2,1763730164.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False
1p2y12n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1p2y12n/my_regime_that_took_me_from_an_empty_shell_of_a/,My regime that took me from an empty shell of a human who could barely go outside to living a mostly normal life with Hashimoto's. Thought this might be useful for newcomers.,"My issues were mainly from the inflammation aspect of Hashi's as opposed to the thyroid/metabolic effects. I had very bad anxiety, faintness, insomnia, migraines, depression and serious brain fog.   
  Here's what I did:  
  a) Gluten-free - not 100% strict on this but avoid gluten where I can. Things like soy sauce and even some beers are fine even though they aren't GF. I tested negative for coeliac and find that gluten gives me tinnitus, insomnia, migraine and body aches.   
  b) Vitamin C - 1000mg a day to support my adrenal system. 2000mg a day when sick also seems to help recover faster (note that I very rarely get sick)  
  c) (Controversial) I upped my salt intake. I used to get very faint and feel like I was going to pass out. I had fairly low blood pressure and my doctor said to me ""you know, in the old days we'd tell you to eat more salt but we're not supposed to sayt ath any more, *wink*"". This seemed to work and the faintness is gone now.  
  d) Other supps/vitamins: Vit D, B12, turmeric, Omega 3. These seem to help inflammation.  
  e) Avoid caffeine. The aftenoon crashes when I drank coffee and even tea were terrible. 2 weeks after quitting I felt more awake all of the time and felt much better.  
  f) (Controversial) Nicotine in the form of pouches seem to keep inflammation down. I stopped for a week and felt worse but not sure if this was related or possibly a temporary flare.  
  g) I generally avoid too much processed foods. Going gluten free is much easier nowadays but it's easy to just keep buying GF versions of junk/processed foods. I eat as fresh as I can and make meals from scratch.  
  h) A lot of people with Hashis have to quit dairy but it doesn't affect me. Similarly to alcohol. I actually tolerate alcohol pretty well now I know what to avoid.  
  i) Getting my TSH to around 1. I always aim for 1 or just under. I fine tune my dose to the 5 mcg to achieve this often taking alternating doses or fixed dose changes on particular days of the week.  
  j) I walk my dog at least 6000 steps per day and climb once per week. I find that the walking is enough to keep me active and weight training is detrimental to how I feel. I read that weight training is quite inflammatory and this does not feel good for days after.  
  k) Sleep for 8 hours per night. I am able to acheive this despite being a night owl. Sometimes I struggle to fall asleep but magnesium helps.  
  l) I tracked my symptoms daily at my worst with a spreadsheet. I put in my symptoms, blood test results, any changes I made and a rating of how good I felt out of 10. This allowed me to track the changes and see how they corrolated.  
  m) Ensure your breakfast is protein-rich enough. Eating cereal would make me ravenously hungry and shakey by 11am. This was caused by the sugar/carb crash so I switched to yogurt and nuts with my cereal (rice krispies) which keeps me full for longer. Weirdly, skipping breakfast entirely makes me feel full for longer than when I have cereal and milk and I often skip breakfast when I'm not that hungry",5,1763730148.0,Hashimotos,3,0.86,False
1p2y0zp,https://i.redd.it/gu4b3uc8zl2g1.jpeg,Trouble in Paris[short story below],"""But you just fixed the door last month! Why won’t it lock?” Bram’s outburst seeped quietly through gritted teeth, five degrees quieter than the words echoing in his head. Does she not UNDERSTAND that she needs to LOOK AFTER the building she rents out? He pressed his lips together, forcing himself to stay silent.

His elderly landlady’s voice crackled through the phone, sharp and unpleasant. Something about it being his mistake, and how young people these days couldn’t use a door lock with grace. Bram sighed, but then caught the faint creak of wood before he could respond.

Yelping, he ran to shut the window by the stove. The smell of his food had lured the neighborhood cat—a terrible tabby with sharp, calculating eyes that seemed to patrol his apartment like it owned the place.

“What is that awful noise?” the old woman barked through the phone.

Bram side-eyed the chimney, purely decorative from day one, and clicked his tongue. If only it worked, he could keep the windows closed and no cats could get in. And maybe he could finally get the AC to function. But he knew better than to hope for more than one complaint at a time.

“I assure you, ma’am, I use locks just like any regular person,” he muttered, grabbing his lampshade and swinging at the cat.

The tabby darted out onto the balcony, scattering pigeons in a furious flutter. “Shoo!” Bram yelled, watching as the birds revealed fresh droppings on the tiles.

“Excuse me, young man?” The phone vibrated against his ear, the elderly voice growing indignant.

“Not you, ma’am…” He buried his fingers in his golden-blonde hair, shut the double French windows, and strode briskly out the front door.

Living in a beautiful Haussmann-styled Parisian building had sounded like a dream from his small-town imagination, but reality was far less glamorous. A better job might finally let him escape this aging piece of history.

“I’m sorry, but I always pay my rent on time. I deserve a working lock. Please have it checked!” He finally barked, glaring at the stubborn mechanism before cutting the call.

""Merde..."" He cursed under his breath kicking the door. It clicked shut. 

He blinked, rattling the handle. 

""Oh, son of a-"" 

He was locked out. The keys were sitting on the coffee table inside his apartment.

In disbelief at his luck, he reluctantly dialed on his phone one more time.

The old woman picked up, the smug smile evident in her voice,"" I thought the lock didn't work?"" 

""Please, isn't there anything you can do?""

""It will take time.""

""How much time?""

""Two hours."" 

He heard a click, followed my beeps.

Bram sighed, his face sinking into his hands. ""Just my luck.""

***

Three polite knocks landed on a wooden french door. Around the door were well kept flowers that oozed out of their pots. Bram scrunched up his nose, pupils dilating as a honeybee buzzed around him.

He heard the clacking of metals before the door opened.

In front of him stood his neighbor. A pretty girl he’d only ever exchanged polite smiles with in the hallway, and had seemed friendly enough.

""Oh, hey! Gomer, was it?"" She asked as she smiled at him.

He smiled awkwardly at her, slightly thrown off. ""Gomer? Who did you hear that from?""  Where the hell did she even get that?

She giggled shaking her head, purple ringlets bouncing against her face, ""Nowhere, I just guessed. You looked like a Gomer."" 

He laughed along, eyebrow twitching, ""It's Bram. And I couldn't catch your name.""

""Piette."" 

""Piette..."" He repeated, trying his best to make his dimples and crows feet visible as he smiled, ""Ms. Piette could I trouble you for a second? I got locked out of my apartment and I need to get to a job interview in a few hours. It's very important and I just wish I could take a quick shower before it."" He raised his eyebrows expectantly, attempting his charm at her. It worked with most women.

""Ahh, you want to put your best foot forward!"" Piette nodded. ""Sure! Come in.""

As Bram stepped foot inside the apartment, he raised an eyebrow.

The floor was covered with large sheets of paper with geometric lines and scribbles everywhere. Walls were decked in framed sketches and paintings of buildings.

Behind him, Piette shut the door with a fork contraption.

""I see your lock hasn't been working either."" Bram smiled. Piette nodded, laughing. ""Yep, it's fun to diy this stuff though.""

The windows were ajar in the living room. Pigeons pecked on the balcony floor, picking up grains with their beaks. And on the low couch, a familiar tabby sat flicking his tail. 

""The cat!"" Bram pointed out of reflex, before spotting the bowl of milk beside the couch. ""Is...that your cat?""

""That's Gomer!"" Piette smiled, pushing the papers aside with her toes as she walked in a precise movement as if it a daily activity. "" Technically he's not mine. But he likes to visit often.""

""Ahaha, so..that's Gomer?"" Bram bit his cheeks to fight a retort.

Piette blinked,""Oh!"" She chuckled,""Yeah, I named him Gomer. Sorry, I just thought looked like him.""

Bram scrunched up his eyerbrows as he stared at the mean eyed cat trying to dig out any sense of similarity.

Finally, he decided that the sooner he was out of this weirdness the better, ""Ah... could I get a towel?""

***

The loofah rubbed across his tan skin, the soap lathering up a foam, ""Can't believe she feeds that demon. She's the reason why it doesn't leave the building."" He muttered to himself, running his hands through his wet hair.

He turned open the shower and water streamed down his back. He sighed. ""And she says I look like the thing? As if! If i were a cat I'd at least be a Maine coon or a Russian blue!""

Suddenly he saw something scurry in the corner of his eye. 

""AHH!” he screamed, scrambling onto the commode, twisting the towel around himself in a panicked mess.

""WHAT IS IT?"" Piette slammed the bathroom door open, eyes wide, a broom in her hands.

""M-m-mouse!"" He pointed at the shower stand, standing on one leg.

Piette quickly look away, eyes flickering to him.

Only then did he realize what state he was in. Covered in white foam from head to toe with only a towel to cover his lower half.

He suddenly heard a sniffle of laughter but she quickly covered her mouth. ""I'm sorry, Gomer must have chased it in."" She pressed a fist into her lips, ""On second thought, you're very little like a cat.""

""Get out."" Bram snapped at last reaching over to snatch the broomstick from her. ""And lock the door or the papers will fly in. Or keep it open its not like the drawings can get any worse. ""

""Excuse me?"" Piette raised her eyebrows, scoffing. Bram stepped down and grabbed the door handle. ""Apologies."" He shut the door on her face.

""Unbelievable!"" He heard her yell from the other side. ”Well, that’s one way to say ‘thank you for the hospitality!'""

***

After having washed off, Bram had cooled off significantly. He walked out of the bathroom, wiping his hair with the towel when saw Piette with his back to him, sketching on her drawing table.

""Thank you..."" He smiled awkwardly, ""for the shower."" 

Piette waved her hand without looking back seemingly focused on her work.

Bram glanced at the drawing. Complicated lines and shapes and numbers were scribbled around them. Not quite artwork.

""Are you an architect?"" Bram continued, hesitation in his voice.

Piette glanced at him, "" Nope, just someone who makes bad art in her living room.""

Bram sighed, flustered, ""Look, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I didnt mean to offend you.""

""No problem-o."" Said Piette flatly, as she still wouldn't face him.

Bram internally groaned.

***

All Bram could think about that day was the incident with Piette. Even after his job interview and his first day as a barista, she kept seeping into his mind.

When he got back to the old apartment building in the evening, the lock had been fixed. He saw her window open and warm golden light glowing from within.

He bit his cheeks and ducked into the liquor store nearby.

***

Three polite knocks landed on a wooden french door for the second time that day.

Once again, the purple haired girl opened the door but only slightly. Her eyes widened at then narrowed as she saw him.

""I got the job!"" He raised the bottle of red wine with a smile. ""Care to join me, Piette?"" He noticed that the lock contraption had changed, it was now tied with a white shoe lace.

""Um,"" She looked at him up and down.

""Please?"" Bram smiled expectantly.

""Sure."" She said after a pause. She unhooked the shoelace to open the door fully.

Warm fairy lights were hung on the walls, the papers on the floor had been moved. 

""It would be a nice break. A bit of wine."" Said Piette as she brought two glasses from the kitchen. 

""You’ve been at it all day?” Bram asked, eyeing her drawings. The chaotic scribbles were slowly taking shape, forming sketches of buildings.

""Yep, that's what an architect does."" She smiled, shrugging.

""So I did guess correctly."" Bram raised an eyebrow cheekily.

""Well, I am a intern currently. I want to go into restorative architecture.""

""Well this building would be the perfect start.""

Piette chuckled, ""It has it's own charm though, don't you think?""

She bent down to remove a sheet from the balcony floor with bird droppings, folding it and keeping it aside, revealing the spotless marble underneath.

""Wow,"" said Bram, ""Why didn't I think of that?""

She laughed, pouring them both a drink as he leaned on the wrought iron railing. 

The street below glowed under the soft amber of streetlights, cars drifting past in a steady stream, their headlights casting fleeting shadows on the cobblestones.

""You can see the eiffel tower from here,"" said Piette, handing him a glass and leaning beside him.

""Really?"" Bram squinted his eyes as he took a sip.

""There,"" Piette pointed with her finger, ""The tip of it.""

In the distance, the pointed tip of the tower could be seen, a pinprick of light.

Bram laughed, ""I do see it."" 

Suddenly something soft brushed against his leg. ""Oh look who it is,"" said Piette kneeling down to pick up the feline.

""Gomer."" Bram replied, ""The master of mischief.""

They exchanged laughter, petting its soft fur as it snuggled in her arms.

""So, what was the job interview for?"" inquired Piette, placing the cat down gently.

""Barista at Cafe Marquise,"" said Bram, ""It's only a temporary job though. I'm trying to complete my portfolio for a fashion firm.""

""You're a fashion designer?"" Piette's eyes sparkled under the lights.

""Yep."" He said and, noticing her look him up and down, scrunched his eyebrows in amusement, ""Come on, I don't waste designer clothes in a rundown place like this. I want the best of the best to wear my designs."" He confessed, a decisive look flickered in his eyes as he gazed at the Eiffiel tower's spire peaking through the skyline,""I'm going to be on Paris fashion week one day."" 

Piette gazed at him with a smile, and then looked away taking another sip, ""You're a cool guy Bram. I admire you.""

""Just a small town guy who came to Paris with big dreams."" Bram sighed,""I'll get out of this place. Soon.""

""So this job and this apartment are just a stepping stone to you?"" Piette hummed, swirling the glass. ""But why do you wait for your environment to change to be who you are.""

Bram glanced at her, shifting his weight.  

""You already could be living the dream."" She added, a small smile playing on her lips.

He watched her, the wind teasing purple locks across her face, the red scarf brushing against her pink cheeks, and the faint aroma of flowers weaving through the evening air. The tabby cat purred softly between them.

""You are, aren't you? Living the dream, right here."" Said Bram, breaking the short silence.

She shrugged, ""It's all in how you sketch it."" She winked at him and burst into a laugh. ""And how you sketch it is a choice you make.""

The DIY lock, the makeshift dropping catcher, the pigeons and cats. The same things that hassled him, were part of what made her day brighter. A practice canvas she could make anything of.

They lived in the same building, yet worlds apart.

Yet somehow their worlds had collided.

Bram refilled their glass. Piette held hers up, ""To living the dream!""

Bram smiled, a genuine dimply smile, ""To living the dream,"" He added, ""Right where we are.""",0,1763730141.0,writers,1,0.5,False

Moringa oleifera—often called the ""miracle tree""—has become one of the most talked-about superfoods lately, and for good reason. But with so many brands on the market, how do you know which one to choose?

In my opinion, and based on extensive user data and performance evaluation of **Rosabella Moringa Capsules** , I'd rate this at **3.5/5** – there are some inconsistent results,  and limited transparency in third-party testing—also many users experiencing no noticeable benefits even after consistent use.

I would rather recommend [**Organic India Moringa**](https://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/organicmoringa.php) **(rated 4.5/5) instead**, which has better consistency in reliable results thanks to its certified organic status, regenerative agriculture practices, rigorous heavy metal testing, and proven track record of user satisfaction across energy, immune support, and overall wellness.

**What Is Moringa Oleifera?**

The moringa leaf powder comes from the Moringa oleifera tree, sometimes called the horseradish tree, which grows primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, and modern research is now validating many of its health claims.

Moringa is genuinely impressive when it comes to nutritional density. It contains a remarkable array of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and amino acids—all in their natural, plant-based form. We're talking about significant amounts of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, potassium, iron, and protein, which is why moringa is often called ""nature's multivitamin.""

**Rosabella Moringa Capsules: What's Inside?**

Rosabella positions their product as pure moringa powder in capsule form, highlighting that each serving (2 tablets) delivers 800mg of moringa. According to their marketing, this includes:

* 27 essential vitamins
* 9 amino acids
* 46 antioxidants

Rosabella Moringa is manufactured in the USA with globally sourced ingredients and claims to be third-party tested for quality and purity. The capsules are vegan, and the company states there are no fillers, binders, or synthetic additives.

On paper, this sounds promising. The moringa dosage of 800mg per serving falls within the typical range for moringa capsules, and the emphasis on purity is certainly what you want to see in any supplement.

**Real User Experiences with Rosabella Moringa**

Based on feedback from individuals who have tried Rosabella Moringa Capsules, the results are decidedly mixed—and this pattern is something I see frequently when evaluating supplements that may not meet the highest sourcing and quality standards.

**The Positive Experiences**

Some users reported genuinely positive changes after taking Rosabella Moringa regularly. One woman described feeling more consistent energy throughout the day without crashes, noticing brighter and healthier-looking skin, and experiencing improved digestion. She felt like her body was finally getting nutrients it had been missing and made the capsules a daily habit she didn't want to skip.

Another user found that just one capsule daily (rather than the recommended two) worked well for her, providing increased energy levels, eliminating brain fog, and improving sleep quality. This suggests that for some people, even a lower moringa dosage can produce noticeable effects.

A woman in menopause shared an interesting experience: after two months of use, she noticed deeper, longer sleep, felt calmer about life's challenges, and observed changes in her belly fat composition and overall weight. She attributed these improvements to better digestion and became such a fan that she set up an auto-subscription.

**The Disappointing Results**

However, not everyone experienced benefits. One user took the capsules as directed for three weeks without seeing any noticeable changes. Another person specifically bought them hoping for help with energy but noticed no difference even after a full month of consistent use.

One individual was hoping moringa would help with arthritis symptoms but found it provided no relief in that area.

This inconsistency in results is telling. While individual responses to any supplement will always vary, when you see a pattern where some people experience nothing while others have positive outcomes, it often points to issues with product quality, sourcing, or potency.

**Rosabella Moringa Benefits for Women**

Many women are drawn to moringa supplements specifically because of benefits that matter to female health and wellness. Let's look at what moringa can potentially offer:

**Energy Without the Crash**: Unlike caffeine from coffee or energy drinks, moringa provides natural energy by helping your body convert calories from food into fuel rather than storing them as fat. For busy women juggling multiple responsibilities, this steady energy boost without jitters or afternoon crashes can be genuinely life-changing.

**Skin Health and Glow**: The high levels of antioxidants, vitamin A, and vitamin C in moringa support skin health from the inside out. Several women reported noticing brighter, healthier-looking skin after consistent use. The anti-inflammatory properties may also help with skin conditions affected by inflammation.

**Hormonal Balance and Menopause Support**: The woman who reported improvements in menopause symptoms—better sleep, reduced stress, and changes in body composition—highlights moringa's potential role in supporting hormonal balance. While more research is needed, the nutrient density and adaptogenic-like qualities of moringa may help women navigate hormonal transitions.

**Digestive Comfort**: Moringa leaf powder contains fiber and compounds that support digestive health. Women who struggle with bloating, irregularity, or general gut discomfort may find relief with consistent moringa supplementation.

**Lactation Support**: Some breastfeeding mothers turn to moringa hoping it will help increase milk supply. While individual results vary (as one mom's experience with Organic India Moringa showed), it's a popular natural approach worth considering, though you should always consult with your healthcare provider first.

**Nutrient Support for Active Lifestyles**: For women who exercise regularly, are vegetarian or vegan, or simply want to ensure they're getting adequate nutrition, moringa's impressive profile of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids can fill nutritional gaps.

That said, experiencing these benefits depends heavily on the quality of the moringa supplement you choose.

**Why I Recommend Organic India Moringa Over Rosabella**

After years of working with clients and evaluating supplement quality based on user outcomes and manufacturing standards, I consistently recommend **Organic India Moringa** as the superior choice. Here's why:

**Certified Organic and Regenerative Agriculture**

Organic India uses regenerative organic agriculture practices and sources their moringa from native landscapes where the plant naturally thrives. This matters more than you might think.

Moringa is often grown in countries where soil contamination and production standards can vary significantly. Heavy metals, pesticides, and other contaminants can end up in your supposedly ""healthy"" supplement if sourcing isn't carefully managed.

With Organic India's certified organic moringa, you're getting a product grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, in soil that's been verified as meeting organic standards. Their commitment to regenerative practices also means they're improving soil health over time rather than depleting it.

**No Fillers, Binders, or Stearates**

While Rosabella claims to be pure moringa without fillers, Organic India explicitly states their product contains no fillers, binders, or stearates. Based on user feedback patterns, the consistency of positive results with Organic India suggests their purity claims hold up in practice.

**Third-Party Testing for Heavy Metals**

One user specifically mentioned appreciating that Organic India's moringa was tested for heavy metals—a crucial quality marker that should be non-negotiable for any supplement you put in your body. Given that moringa absorbs nutrients readily from soil (which is part of what makes it so nutritionally dense), it can also absorb contaminants if grown in poor conditions.

**More Consistent User Results**

Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from actual user experiences. The feedback on Organic India Moringa shows more consistent positive outcomes. Users report benefits like improved immune support, better energy levels, easier breathing and phlegm clearance, and general wellness improvements.

One long-term user has been returning to Organic India's moringa capsules for years, specifically choosing capsules over moringa powder because they dislike the taste but want the benefits. She noted feeling confident in the brand's quality and safety standards—trust that comes from consistent positive experiences over time.

Another user felt the product was helping with cortisol levels and immune system support, and planned to increase her dosage after several weeks of positive results. She appreciated the clean taste (no unpleasant moringa flavor), natural formulation, and the brand's high standards.

**Better Value for Quality**

While you might find cheaper moringa supplements, the consistency of quality with Organic India justifies the investment. As one user noted, buying in bulk when possible makes it more affordable, and the peace of mind knowing you're getting a genuinely beneficial product is worth it.

**Moringa Powder vs Capsules: Which Is Better?**

If you're deciding between moringa powder and moringa capsules, here's what you need to know:

**Moringa Powder** is versatile—you can add it to smoothies, juices, or foods. However, moringa has a distinctly earthy, slightly bitter taste that many people find unpleasant. If you don't mind the flavor or can mask it well in recipes, powder gives you flexibility in dosage and use.

**Pure Moringa Capsules** offer convenience and eliminate the taste issue entirely. You can take them with water anywhere, anytime, without worrying about mixing or flavor. For most people I work with, capsules lead to better compliance because they're simply easier to take consistently. Organic India Capsules can be twisted and pull-opened and you can mix the powder to any smoothie or drink.

The most important factor isn't the form—it's the quality of the moringa itself. Both Rosabella and Organic India offer capsule forms, but based on sourcing standards and user outcomes, Organic India's capsules deliver more reliable results.

**Understanding Moringa Benefits: What to Expect**

This green superfood has legitimate benefits backed by research, but it's not a magic cure-all.

**Energy and Vitality**

Moringa is an effective caffeine alternative, providing steady natural energy without jitters or crashes. The B vitamins, iron, and amino acids support your body's metabolic processes and energy production efficiently. However, if your fatigue stems from underlying health conditions or sleep deprivation, moringa alone won't solve the problem.

**Immune Support**

The antioxidants in moringa—including quercetin, chlorogenic acid, and beta-carotene—provide genuine immune system support by protecting cells from oxidative stress. Users of Organic India Moringa noted feeling stronger immune function, which aligns with its rich vitamin C, vitamin A, and anti-inflammatory compounds.

**Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Moringa contains anti-inflammatory compounds that may benefit those dealing with chronic inflammation. However, one user found no relief for arthritis, showing that while moringa has anti-inflammatory properties, it works better as a preventive supplement than treatment for acute conditions.

**Blood Sugar Support**

Research suggests moringa may help with blood sugar regulation by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing post-meal spikes. If you're dealing with pre-diabetes or metabolic syndrome, moringa is worth considering—but always consult your healthcare provider, especially if you're on medication.

**Skin Health and Detox**

The high antioxidant content, particularly vitamin A and vitamin C, does support skin health through collagen production and cell repair. While moringa detox claims are overstated (your liver and kidneys handle detoxification naturally), it does support these organs by providing nutrients and antioxidants.

**Weight Loss Expectations**

Moringa isn't a weight loss supplement, but may support weight management indirectly by providing steady energy, supporting blood sugar control, improving digestion, and providing metabolic nutrients. Without addressing diet, exercise, sleep, and stress, you'll likely be disappointed if taking moringa purely for weight loss.

**Moringa Dosage: How Much Should You Take?**

Most moringa capsules provide 400mg to 1,000mg per serving. Rosabella recommends 800mg daily (two capsules), but one user found even 400mg daily effective. I recommend starting with a lower moringa dosage to see how your body responds, then adjusting as needed.

Research studies have used doses from 500mg to several grams daily with good safety profiles. The key is consistency—taking moringa regularly matters more than large sporadic doses.

If you're pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking medications (especially for diabetes or blood pressure), consult your healthcare provider before starting any moringa supplement, as it can interact with certain medications.

**The Importance of Third-Party Testing**

Third-party testing separates quality supplements from questionable ones. Organic India's commitment to testing for heavy metals and contaminants is crucial, especially for moringa which absorbs extensively from its growing environment.

Third-party testing means an independent laboratory verifies the product contains what the label claims, contaminants like heavy metals, pesticides, and microbes are within safe limits, and quality standards are met. Without this verification, you're trusting the manufacturer's word—unfortunately not always warranted in the supplement industry.

 

**Other Moringa Brands Worth Mentioning**

While I'm specifically recommending Organic India Moringa over Rosabella, I should mention a couple of other reputable brands in the moringa space:

**Kuli Kuli Moringa** is another well-known brand that emphasizes sustainable sourcing and women's empowerment in the communities where they source moringa. They offer both powder and bar formats.

**Pura Vida Moringa** is popular among those who want to support fair trade practices. Their products are organic and they work directly with farming communities.

**Making Moringa Part of Your Wellness Routine**

If you decide to try moringa—and I think most people can benefit from adding this nutrient-dense superfood to their routine—here's how to set yourself up for success:

**Start with Organic India Moringa capsules** rather than Rosabella. The superior sourcing, organic certification, and consistent user results make it the smarter choice.

**Be consistent**. Take your moringa daily, preferably at the same time each day. Benefits typically become noticeable after 2-4 weeks of consistent use.

**Don't expect miracles**. Moringa is a supportive, preventive supplement that works best as part of a healthy overall lifestyle. It won't compensate for poor diet, lack of sleep, or chronic stress.

**Listen to your body**. If you notice any adverse reactions, reduce your dose or discontinue use. While moringa is generally very safe, everyone's body is different.

**Combine with other healthy habits**. Moringa works synergistically with good nutrition, regular movement, adequate sleep, and stress management. Think of it as one piece of your wellness puzzle, not the whole solution.

**The Bottom Line: Is Rosabella the Best Moringa Supplement?**

Based on my experience coaching clients and analyzing user data across moringa products, I cannot recommend Rosabella Moringa Capsules as the best option on the market.

While some users experienced positive results with Rosabella, the inconsistency of outcomes raises concerns about quality control and sourcing. Organic India Moringa demonstrates consistently positive user experiences, certified organic standards, regenerative agriculture practices, and explicit third-party testing for contaminants—making the choice clear.

Organic India Moringa offers superior quality, more reliable results, and peace of mind with genuinely pure, properly sourced moringa capsules. The moringa miracle tree offers real benefits—improved energy, immune support, nutrient density, and overall vitality—but only with a quality product.

Hello Carrboro!

We’re in the very early stages of preparing to sell our home in downtown Carrboro. It’s a well-maintained 3BR/2BA house, near Lanza’s Coffee and down the block from Town Hall and the fire station. 

Built in 1990 and owned/occupied since 2010, it has been lovingly cared for and extensively upgraded. 

I’ve put a huge amount of work and cost into keeping this home in great shape and making many major improvements. I’m happy to share details via direct message. I’m also glad to arrange a personal showing for anyone who’s seriously interested.

Why post this on Reddit?
Because we’d love to sell directly to an individual or family through a simple FSBO (for sale by owner) transaction. Skipping real estate agents means both the buyer and seller can avoid hefty commission fees; roughly $30K-$40K savings overall.

I’ve sold a property in Carrboro without an agent before, and it was surprisingly easy. We’d use a straightforward contract from LegalZoom and a local closing attorney (for a relatively low fee) to handle the official paperwork. 

By avoiding agent commissions, the buyer pays less for the house and I earn more on the sale; an actual win-win.

We’ve truly loved living here, and it’s a great home in a great location. Walkable to everything Carrboro has to offer. If you’re a serious buyer looking for a downtown Carrboro house, please feel free to send me a message. I’m easy to work with, and selling without agents simply requires both sides to be reasonable, communicative, and low-drama.

Timing: Ideally, we’d like to have the house under contract in December or January, with closing on either March 1 or March 15.  

This is a rare opportunity to buy an awesome house in a great location in the best small town in North Carolina. 

Thanks for reading, and please reach out with a direct message if you’re interested. 

(For privacy reasons, I will not be sharing the address or other specific details on this thread, so please send a direct message for more information.)",12,1763730009.0,carrboro,9,0.83,False

Sharp, disconcerting raps that suggested something inside was either breaking or attempting to escape...","Good morning! We tend to take our modern conveniences for granted—at least until they decide to stage a dramatic collapse. My printer, purchased nearly twenty years ago for the princely sum of $49.99, had faithfully churned out thousands of pages. It had been a loyal workhorse, though admittedly a somewhat noisy one in its later years.

There had been warning signs. Grinding. Clanking. Sharp, disconcerting raps that suggested something inside was either breaking or attempting to escape. Each time I pressed “Print,” I crossed my fingers and hoped for a small miracle. But eventually the old trooper reached the end of its journey. No amount of troubleshooting, fiddling, coaxing, or pleading would revive it.

Thankfully, a relative had recently replaced her printer and offered me her old one. Crisis solved. I removed the freshly installed ink cartridges from my deceased machine—one of many last-ditch efforts to save it—in case someone else could use them. Then I carried the lifeless printer to the tool bench in the garage, where it would await the next chapter of its afterlife.

As I made my way there, I felt something damp running down my side. Odd. When I set the printer down, the truth became clear: in that brief walk across the house, the poor thing had leaked the last of its life’s blood all over me. Apparently, its life’s blood was black ink—and quite a lot of it.

I had already taken a shower that morning, but since I didn’t want to leave dark smears on everything I touched for the rest of the day, I took another one, scrubbing with enough soap to clean a small whale after being rescued from an oil slick. My clothing, however, was past redemption. My wardrobe is minimal, and I don't have much in the way of extra clothing, but fortunately those garments were already well past their prime. I stuffed the sacrificial outfit into the printer’s insides to stem the flow of ink until it could be responsibly disposed of. I can only imagine the thoughts of the person who eventually opens the machine at the recycling center. 

Anyway, my new-to-me printer is now in place and ready to roll. It works beautifully and—best of all—without the drama. No ominous clunks, no groans, no gears that sound like they're grinding coffee beans. Just a nice, crisp printed page. Peaceful. Quiet. Almost suspiciously so.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞 ",1,1763729787.0,u_Read_an_ice_age_saga,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

She hasn't aged a single day.,"The title of this post is something I have whispered to myself for over a decade, but never dared to type out. People worry about your mental health when you talk about ghosts. They worry even more when you tell them you are living with one.

But I’m thirty-six now. I’m established, I’m stable, and I’m far enough away from the event to look at it clearly. I need to get this down, because I looked at her this morning—really looked at her—and I realized the truth is undeniable.

To understand what I have now, you have to understand what I lost.

It started fifteen years ago. I was twenty-one, living in a cramped, drafty apartment in Montreal with the love of my life, Marianne. We were young, stupidly in love, and perpetually broke. Marianne was everything I wasn't. I was quiet, anxious, and prone to overthinking. Marianne was a firecracker. She was loud, she laughed with her whole chest, and she had the most piercing, impossible blue eyes I have ever seen on a human being.

She was my anchor. Until the night I let her drive away angry.

The argument was stupid. It’s the cliché of every tragedy, isn't it? We fought over money. We were short on rent, and she had spent a little extra on concert tickets for my birthday. I should have been grateful. Instead, I yelled. I told her she was irresponsible. I told her she didn't take our future seriously.

The last words I said to her were, ""Just get out. I can't look at you right now.""

So, she did. She grabbed her keys, her eyes swimming with tears that made that blue look like a stormy ocean, and she slammed the door.

Two hours later, the police were knocking. Black ice on the highway. She had lost control of our beat-up Honda and went over the guardrail. She died on impact.

The weeks following the funeral are a blur of gray. I don't remember eating. I don't remember sleeping, really. I just remember laying in our bed, staring at the empty spot beside me, smelling the fading scent of her vanilla shampoo on the pillowcase.

The guilt was a physical weight. It sat on my chest like an anvil. I had killed her. I convinced myself of that. If I hadn't yelled, if I hadn't kicked her out, she would be safe in bed. I was a murderer.

That was when the activity started.

At first, I welcomed it. It began small. I would come home from my waitressing job to find things displaced. A picture frame turned face down. The cabinet doors in the kitchen wide open. The temperature in the apartment would plummet, leaving my breath visible in the air despite the radiator clanking away at full blast.

My grieving mind didn't register fear. It registered hope. “Marianne?” I would whisper into the darkness. “Is that you?”

I assumed she was back. I assumed she wanted to tell me she was okay. But the atmosphere in the apartment wasn't comforting. It was heavy. It felt oppressive, like the air pressure before a tornado.

Three weeks after the funeral, the activity shifted from passive to aggressive.

I was in the kitchen making tea. I had the kettle on the stove. Suddenly, the burner dial snapped from low to high on its own. The gas flared up with a whoosh. I jumped back, my heart hammering. I reached out to turn it off, and a mug from the drying rack flew off the counter. It didn't just fall; it was thrown. It shattered against the wall inches from my head.

I stood there, shards of ceramic at my feet, trembling.

“Marianne?” I cried out, tears streaming down my face. “I’m sorry! I’m so sorry!”

I thought it was her anger. I thought she was trapped here, furious at me for the way we left things. I deserved it, I told myself. If she wanted to throw things, let her. I deserved every bit of it.

But it got worse.

The nights became unbearable. I would wake up at 3:00 AM to the sound of heavy, wet breathing right next to my ear. Not the soft breath of a sleeping partner, but a raspy, guttural sound. When I reached for the lamp, the bulb would pop with a deafening crack, plunging me back into darkness.

Shadows began to pool in the corners of the room, taller and darker than they should have been. They seemed to stretch toward the bed. I stopped sleeping. I became a ghost of myself, dark circles under my eyes, shaking through my shifts at work.

The culmination happened on a Tuesday in November. It was a month after the accident.

I was lying in bed, fully dressed, because I was too terrified to change into pajamas anymore. I was staring at the ceiling, waiting for the sun to rise. The silence in the apartment was deafening. Then, the temperature dropped. It wasn't gradual; it was instant. The air went freezing cold, so sharp it hurt my nose to inhale.

I squeezed my eyes shut. “I’m sorry, Marianne,” I whispered, my mantra of guilt.

Something grabbed my ankles.

It wasn't a gentle touch. It was a vice grip, strong and painful, like two bands of steel clamping down on my bones. I gasped, my eyes flying open. I tried to kick, but my legs wouldn't move.

With a violent jerk, I was ripped down the mattress.

I screamed. I clawed at the sheets, desperate for purchase, but the fabric just bunched in my hands. I was dragged off the foot of the bed, my hips slamming hard onto the hardwood floor.

The grip didn't let go. I was being pulled across the floor of the bedroom, toward the open closet door. The closet was a gaping maw of darkness.

“Marianne! Stop! Please!” I shrieked.

I grabbed the leg of the heavy oak dresser as I slid past. The friction burned my palms, but I held on. The force pulling my legs was immense, threatening to dislocate my hips. I was sobbing, hysterical, kicking wildly with my feet against empty air.

Suddenly, the grip vanished.

I didn't wait. I scrambled up, scrambled into the corner of the room, and curled into a ball, hyperventilating. I stayed there until dawn broke, watching the closet, waiting for her to come back and finish me.

I looked at my ankles in the morning light. There were bruises. distinct, finger-shaped bruises. But they weren't the size of Marianne’s hands. Marianne had small, delicate hands. These marks were large. The fingers were too long.

A cold realization settled in my gut. That wasn't Marianne.

Marianne had a temper, yes. She could be fiery. But she was never cruel. She would never hurt me physically. She loved me. Even in our worst moments, she loved me. Whatever was in my apartment, whatever was dragging me toward the dark, wasn't the woman I loved. It was something else. Something that fed on misery. And I was an all-you-can-eat buffet.

I was terrified to go back to the apartment, but I had nowhere else to go. I spent the day walking around the city, freezing in the November wind, dreading the sunset.

That evening, as I approached the front steps of my building, I saw something sitting near the communal trash cans.

It was a cat.

It wasn't scrounging for food, and it wasn't fleeing from the noise of the street. It was sitting perfectly still, its tail wrapped neatly around its paws, watching me. It was a calico, mostly white with patches of orange and black.

I stopped at the bottom of the stairs. The cat stood up and let out a soft mrrp sound. It walked right up to me, winding through my legs, rubbing its cheek against my shins. I reached down automatically to pet it. The fur was soft, surprisingly clean for a stray.

Then, the cat looked up at me.

The breath caught in my throat. The eyes. They were blue. Not the greenish-yellow or amber typical of cats. They were a deep, striking, impossible electric blue.

They were her eyes.

I fell to my knees on the sidewalk, ignoring the cold concrete. I stared at the cat, and the cat stared back with an intelligence that felt jarring. It bumped its forehead against my nose, purring—a sound like a small engine.

“Hey,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The cat didn't run away. When I stood up and unlocked the front door of the building, the cat trotted inside ahead of me as if it owned the place. I hesitated, then followed. It climbed the three flights of stairs to my apartment door and sat there, waiting for me to turn the key.

I opened the door. Usually, the dread would hit me the moment I crossed the threshold. The heavy, malicious atmosphere.

The cat walked in first. It strutted into the center of the living room, sat down, and let out a long, low hiss. It wasn't hissing at me. It was staring at the dark hallway leading to the bedroom. The fur along its spine stood up in a rigid ridge.

I stood by the door, paralyzed.

The cat held its ground. It let out a growl that sounded too deep for its small body. Then, it strode forward, into the hallway, into the bedroom. I heard a thump, like something heavy falling, and then silence. The cat came trotting back out a moment later, its tail held high, looking relaxed.

It walked over to the couch—Marianne’s favorite spot—jumped up, curled into a ball, and went to sleep.

For the first time in a month, the apartment felt… empty. But in a good way. The heavy pressure was gone.

I didn't kick the cat out. I named her Marianne. It felt sacrilegious to anyone else, I’m sure, but it felt like the only option to me.

Things changed after Marianne the cat moved in.

The supernatural activity didn't stop immediately, but it changed. It felt like a war was being waged, but I was no longer the soldier. I was the civilian being protected.

One night, I was watching TV. The air grew cold again. The familiar scent of ozone and rot began to creep in. I tensed up, clutching a pillow.

Marianne, who had been dozing on my lap, instantly woke up. She leaped off the couch and stood in the center of the room. She stared at an empty corner near the ceiling. Her ears pinned back flat against her skull. She let out a scream—that specific, yowling caterwaul that cats make when they are about to fight.

The lights flickered. The TV turned itself off.

Marianne launched herself at the wall. She literally ran halfway up the drywall, claws out, swiping at the empty air. I saw—and I swear this is true—a dark, misty shape recoil from her.

She landed on her feet and hissed again, spitting, her blue eyes blazing. The cold air dissipated instantly. The TV flickered back on. Marianne sat down, licked her paw, and looked at me as if to say, 'It’s handled.'

This happened a few more times over the next month. Whatever that thing was, whatever dark parasite had latched onto my grief, it was trying to come back. And every time, Marianne was there. She was a sentinel. She slept on the pillow next to my head every single night. If I shifted in a nightmare, she would place a paw on my cheek, grounding me.

I started to notice things about her behavior. Things that made the hairs on my arms stand up.

My human girlfriend, Marianne, had a very specific hate for olives. If a pizza came with olives, she would pick them off with surgical precision and stack them in a pyramid on a napkin.

One night, I ordered a supreme pizza. I was eating at the coffee table. The cat jumped up. She sniffed a slice. She delicately used her claw to hook an olive, fling it off the pizza onto the table, and then nudged it away with her nose. She did this to every olive on the slice before trying to steal a piece of the pepperoni.

I just stared at her. ""Really?"" I asked.

She blinked slowly.

Marianne, the human, also had a habit of tapping her fingers when she was impatient. The cat, when waiting for me to fill the food bowl, would tap her left paw rhythmically against the floor tiles. Tap, tap, tap.

She didn't like cat toys. I bought feathers, laser pointers, fake mice. She looked at them with disdain. But she loved watching reality TV. She would sit on the back of the couch, eyes glued to the screen, head moving back and forth as the people argued. Human Marianne used to say it was her ""trashy guilty pleasure.""

Slowly, the fear in my life evaporated. The dark entity gave up. It couldn't get past the guard dog—or rather, the guard cat. By the time spring arrived, the apartment was just an apartment again.

But I was never alone.

I talked to her. I know that’s what “crazy cat ladies” do, but this was different. I told her about my day. I told her I was sorry about the fight. I told her I loved her.

Whenever I apologized for the accident, for the argument, she would butt her head against my mouth to silence me. She would purr so loudly it rattled her ribs. It was forgiveness. I knew it.

Life went on. I moved out of that apartment two years later. Marianne came with me, obviously. I went back to school. I got a degree. I started a career in graphic design. I dated a few people, though it never really worked out. It’s hard to bring someone home when you feel like your dead ex is judging them from the top of the cat tree.

And that brings us to today.

I was sitting on my porch this morning, drinking coffee. Marianne was sunning herself on the railing.

I realized the date. October 14th. It has been exactly fifteen years since the accident. It has been fifteen years minus three weeks since I found the cat.

I looked at her.

Fifteen years is a long time for a cat. A cat at fifteen is usually slowing down. They have gray hairs around their muzzle. Their eyes get cloudy with cataracts. They sleep twenty hours a day. They have trouble jumping onto high surfaces.

Marianne looks exactly the same as the day I found her.

I mean exactly. Her fur is pristine, silky and vibrant. There is not a single white hair on her black and orange patches. Her eyes are that same crystal, piercing electric blue, clear as a summer sky.

She jumped from the porch railing to the roof of the garage this morning—a six-foot vertical leap—to chase a squirrel. She moves with the agility of a kitten. She eats with the appetite of a lion.

I took her to the vet last week for a checkup. The vet, a new guy, looked at her chart.

“Born roughly fifteen years ago?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Yes,” I said. “I found her then.”

He examined her. He checked her teeth, her heart, her joints. He looked perplexed. He took an X-ray just to check for arthritis.

“This is bizarre,” he told me, showing me the scan. “Her bone density, her teeth… if you didn't tell me she was fifteen, I’d say this cat is maybe two years old. Maximum. There’s zero sign of aging. Absolutely none.”

I nodded. I wasn't surprised.

I came home and looked at old photos. I found a picture of human Marianne from her 20th birthday. She’s laughing, looking at the camera. The look in her eyes is defiance and joy mixed together.

Then I looked at the cat, sitting on my desk, watching me write this.

I don't think she’s a cat. I mean, she is a cat, biologically, I suppose. But the spirit inside? The thing looking out through those blue eyes?

The entity that attacked me fifteen years ago wanted to hurt me. It was drawn to my guilt. But Marianne? She fought it off. She came back. She found a vessel that would let her stay.

I’ve read about this kind of thing. Reincarnation, possession, spiritual attachment. Usually, spirits move on. They fade. Or, if they stay in an animal, the animal eventually ages and dies.

But she isn't aging.

She isn't leaving.

I stroked her head a few minutes ago, running my thumb over her ears. I whispered, ""You're not going anywhere, are you?""

She let out a short, sharp meow. It sounded like No.

She bit my thumb gently—another thing human Marianne used to do when she was being playful—and began to lick my hand with her sandpaper tongue.

I’m not scared. I should be, probably. It defies every law of nature. I’m living with a creature that is effectively immortal, inhabited by my dead girlfriend who refuses to cross over because she thinks I can't handle myself alone.

And the honest truth? She’s probably right.

She’s looking at me right now. She wants me to stop typing. She’s tapping her left paw on the desk. Tap, tap, tap.

I guess I better go. She hates to be ignored.

1p2xrg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1p2xrg7/you_dont_need_to_be_an_activist_to_restore/,You Don’t Need to Be an Activist to Restore Rainforests - You Just Need Wi-Fi,"Welcome to our **RainforestLand review** (previously **Treeferral**).

In our world where climate change and environmental degradation are becoming increasingly urgent concerns, many of us are seeking ways to contribute positively to the planet.

The idea of planting trees as a means of **biodiversity restoration** and carbon offsetting is appealing, but finding a reliable and impactful service can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.

**Treeferral**, now rebranded as [RainforestLand](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/rainforestland-official) claims to be one of the **best ways to offset carbon emissions**. But does this service really make a difference, or is it just another drop in the ocean? Let's dig deeper and see if this is the solution that's right for you.

# Product Overview: What is RainforestLand?

RainforestLand is a **reforestation service** dedicated to making it easy for businesses and individuals to contribute to environmental sustainability. The service offers a subscription model where your contributions automatically fund tree-planting projects across the globe, focusing on areas that [desperately need reforestation](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/rainforestland-official).

Through partnerships with NGOs and local communities, RainforestLand ensures that your money is well spent, supporting both the planet and the people who inhabit it.

This service isn’t just about planting trees—it's about **restoring biodiversity**, fighting climate change, and creating a greener future. The team at RainforestLand has made it their mission to make the process as seamless and impactful as possible, offering detailed **environmental impact reports** so you can see exactly how your contributions are making a difference.

# Product Analysis Deep Dive

RainforestLand’s **automated tree planting** service is a major player in the crowded field of **environmental sustainability** platforms. With a simple subscription, you can start making a difference without lifting a finger.

The service takes care of everything, from selecting the best sites for reforestation to partnering with reliable NGOs to ensure that the projects are both effective and sustainable.

One of the things I appreciate most about RainforestLand is its transparency. Every subscriber receives **impact reports** that detail the number of trees planted, the carbon offsets achieved, and the positive effects on local biodiversity. These reports are not just fluff—they're backed by hard data, giving you peace of mind that your contributions are genuinely making a difference.

Moreover, [RainforestLand's focus](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/rainforestland-official) on **forest conservation efforts** ensures that your contributions are not just planting trees but also protecting critical ecosystems. These efforts are essential for maintaining the delicate balance of our planet’s environment.

# Personal Experience: My Journey with RainforestLand

I’ve been using RainforestLand for the past six months, and I have to say, it’s been a rewarding experience. There’s something genuinely satisfying about knowing that my small monthly contribution is helping to restore a forest somewhere in the world.

The impact reports are a nice touch—seeing the number of trees I’ve ""planted"" and the corresponding **carbon offset** is motivating.

One day, I received an update that a new project had been started in Madagascar, an area known for its critical **biodiversity**. I felt a surge of pride knowing I was part of that effort.

However, I did find myself wishing the reports were a bit more frequent. Still, the **environmental impact** my contribution has made far outweighs this minor inconvenience.

# Positive Impact Platforms: A New Wave of Environmental Action

RainforestLand is part of a growing movement of **positive impact platforms** that make it easy for individuals and businesses to contribute to **environmental sustainability**. These platforms are not just about feeling good—they’re about making real, measurable differences in the fight against climate change.

By choosing a service like [RainforestLand](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/rainforestland-official), you’re not just planting trees; you’re participating in a global effort to restore our planet’s **biodiversity** and protect the ecosystems we all depend on.

# Pricing Options: What’s the Damage?

RainforestLand offers a variety of subscription plans, catering to both individuals and **eco-friendly businesses**. Prices start as low as a cup of coffee per month, making it accessible for almost everyone.

Higher-tier plans, which are great for **green business solutions**, come with more comprehensive impact reports and additional perks like branding opportunities.

This makes it an attractive option for businesses looking to enhance their **corporate social responsibility** while contributing to **environmental sustainability**.

* Seedling Plan: **$7.99** /month - 36 trees /year
* Garden Plan: **$10.99** /month - 60 trees /year
* Rainforest Plan: **$19.99** /month - 120 trees /year

You also have the option of choosing your own number of trees to plant per month, priced at **$2.99 per tree /month**. Although I'm not sure they've thought this through because it would be cheaper to sign up for multiple yearly packages.

# Sign Up For RainforestLand ...

If you're ready to contribute to reforestation and **climate-positive initiatives**, I strongly recommend purchasing your subscription [directly from the official RainforestLand website](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/rainforestland-official).

1p2xpk4,https://i.redd.it/umjyrv9hwl2g1.png,5 Reiki Practices That Saved My Mental Health During Toronto Winter,"*What to do when -25°C weather meets cultural isolation and you’re just… not okay*

It’s 3 PM on a January afternoon in Toronto, and the sun’s already giving up. I’m in my basement apartment, staring at my laptop, and I can’t remember the last time I felt actually awake. Not just caffeinated and functional — awake.

I’m Arjun, 28, four years into the Canadian immigrant dream. Came from Gujarat with the standard plan: work hard, get a degree, good job, bring family over eventually.

But nobody warns you the winters will mess you up. That you’ll end up sleeping 12 hours straight, ordering takeout at 2 AM, feeling absolutely nothing.

This is how Reiki — yeah, energy healing — pulled me out of that darkness. Not in some magical way, but in a “holy shit, I can breathe again” way.

# The Part Nobody Posts on Instagram

My first Canadian job wasn’t tech — it was Subway on Yonge Street. Morning shifts before class, evenings after. That bread smell lived in my hair. My parents in Ahmedabad saw CN Tower selfies. Never saw the 6 AM alarms or my manager who just called me “buddy.”

But you push through, right? That’s what we do. I graduated, landed a junior dev position, got my work permit. On paper, I was winning.

# When “Making It” Feels Like Shit

By my third winter, I had everything I’d worked for — stable tech job, better apartment in North York, decent paycheck.

And I was completely hollow.

Sleeping until noon on weekends. Ordering butter chicken at 2 AM because I was too exhausted to cook. Drinking alone because the quiet was too loud. Weekends blurred together. I stopped video calling home — couldn’t fake energy anymore.

My coworker Priya noticed first. “Dude, you okay? You seem off.”

I wasn’t depressed — I had a job! I wasn’t struggling — I had money! Just… winter tired. That’s all.

# When Everything Cracks

February. My mom calls — Dad’s not doing great, nothing serious, just getting older. Can I visit?

I looked at my calendar. My deadlines. Ticket prices. My empty apartment.

Something broke. Not dramatically. Not visibly. I just sat on my IKEA couch and felt completely empty. Four years in Canada. Career but no peace. Success on paper, nothing in my chest.

I called in sick. Then again. I wasn’t physically ill, but I wasn’t well either. Stuck in this weird in-between — functional enough to work, too numb to live.

# How I Found Reiki (On Reddit, Of All Places)

Someone on r/TorontoLife was talking about seasonal depression alternatives. Reiki kept coming up. Energy healing, chakras — stuff my engineer brain wanted to dismiss.

But I was desperate enough to try anything.

The idea made sense though: energy gets stuck, blocked, heavy. And you can clear it. I was definitely blocked. Definitely stuck. Definitely heavy.

I found [coto](https://app.coto.world/0YkiL5WAtYb) a platform with quick [5-minute Reiki sessions](https://app.coto.world/0YkiL5WAtYb). Didn’t have to leave my apartment or commit to hour-long things. Perfect for skeptical-but-desperate me.

First session was weird. Video call, practitioner guided my breathing while doing energy work. No lightning bolts. No dramatic moment. Just… pressure lifted off my chest. Pressure I didn’t know was there.

I booked another session. Then another.

# The 5 Practices That Changed Everything

Over three months, I built five practices into my life. Nothing complicated. Just consistent.

# 1. Five Minutes Before Logging On

Every morning before opening my laptop: hands on chest, breathe, set intention. Sounds too simple, right?

It became the difference between dragging myself to work versus choosing to show up. The darkness outside didn’t change. Still freezing. But something inside shifted. I had a practice that was mine, that worked whether the day was good or terrible.

**The shift:** Went from hitting snooze five times to waking up 10 minutes early for this. That alone told me something was working.

# 2. Root Chakra Work for Feeling Grounded

A practitioner explained my root chakra — energy center for safety and groundedness — was basically empty. Made sense. I’d uprooted everything, moved across the world, lived in survival mode for four years.

We did grounding visualizations, red light meditation, affirmations about safety and belonging. That constant buzz of anxiety started fading. I felt less like I was floating in space, more like I had solid ground under me.

**The shift:** Started making decisions faster. Stopped second-guessing everything. Felt like I had a right to take up space.

# 3. Lunch Break Energy Resets

Those 5-minute Reiki sessions became my lunch ritual. Quick stress release at my desk. Coworkers probably thought I was napping. I was clearing morning meeting stress and code review tension before it accumulated.

These micro-sessions stopped the buildup that used to wreck me by 6 PM. Instead of collapsing after work, I had energy to cook. To call home. To actually live.

**The shift:** Stopped needing three coffees to get through afternoons. Had energy left at end of day — hadn’t felt that in years.

# 4. Heart Chakra Healing for Loneliness

Being far from everyone who knew me before I became “Indian tech guy” was killing me quietly. I started sessions focused on heart chakra work — releasing isolation, opening to connection.

Things shifted. I said yes to coworker invites. Joined a cricket group in Scarborough. Had real conversations with my parents instead of “yeah everything’s fine” updates.

Reiki didn’t create community, but it cleared whatever was blocking me from reaching for it.

**The shift:** Made three actual friends. Not just work acquaintances — people I text randomly, grab dinner with, complain to about winters.

# 5. Evening Energy Boundary Practice

Before bed, I learned to “seal” my energy — create a boundary between work stress and rest. Sounds mystical, but practically it meant: visualize light around yourself, release the day’s garbage, call back your own energy.

Stopped scrolling until 2 AM. Stopped stress-eating at midnight. Started actually sleeping — real restorative sleep, not exhausted collapse.

**The shift:** Sleep quality changed everything else. Woke up less tired. Made better decisions. Had patience for things that used to irritate me.

# What’s Actually Different Now

Six months later, I’m not saying everything’s perfect. But here’s what changed:

I wake before my alarm most days. Meal prep on Sundays. Haven’t rage-ordered Skip at 2 AM in two months. Got promoted to intermediate developer in March. Saving money monthly for my parents’ move.

But the real thing? I feel like myself again. Not the old Ahmedabad version, not just “stressed immigrant guy.” Someone integrated — the dreamer and the builder, who also knows when to rest.

Dad’s health thing turned out fine. I’m planning to bring my parents to Vancouver next year. And I’m actually excited — not desperate, not anxious. Excited. Because I have energy to imagine that future clearly.

# If You’re Reading This From Your Basement Apartment

If you’re in Toronto, Vancouver, anywhere in Canada where winter feels endless and work feels meaningless — this is for you.

You don’t have to stay in that overwork-oversleep-overeating-overthinking cycle. You don’t need to wait until you’ve “made it enough” to take care of yourself.

Reiki isn’t magic. [It’s intentional energy work](https://app.coto.world/0YkiL5WAtYb). Making space for yourself in a life that demands everything.

I’m still working hard. Still building toward family reunification. Still dealing with Canadian winters. But I have practices now that keep me steady, clear, present.

The cold’s still cold. The dark’s still dark. But I’m not drowning anymore.

And that changes absolutely everything.",1,1763729220.0,u_cotoapp25,0,1.0,False

Via apps, they all say nice things and that they want to meet but they take days to answer back and in most cases we never end up setting up a date because they just stop answering. I always propose coffee/ going for a walk dates...


In the office, is in a work setting so of course I try to be careful with what I say. I generally speak with everyone and people tend to say I'm funny and I can talk a lot but some other times I'm just drained and I may seem rude or uninterested.

I sometimes try to have one on one conversations with girls I find interesting. Most of the time is just conversations for a few days until the moment I really feel like asking them out on a date.

Typically I wait a few days before I actually ask them out. Only when I feel the moment is right I do it.

Maybe that's a mistake on my side? Because typically I wait until I get some kind of feelings towards them and then I get nervous while asking them out....

I still do, but they tend to answer that they are busy or whatever but never propose an alternative plan or anything. I don't mention the word date typically. Also I'm not sure if it would make a difference. But just because they kinda shot me down I just stop trying anything with them and move on to someone else.

I may still say hi or talk, but with less interest.

This same situation has happened with several girls. It really frustrates me, I'm just tired of dating. What can I do?

1p2xmop,https://i.redd.it/we9f7orpvl2g1.png,Mediatek Dimensity Auto Cockpit: Brain of Modern Cars,"Okay so I don’t usually get hyped about car tech. Most of it feels like the same stuff with a new name. 

But when I saw the title ""**Mediatek Dimensity Auto Cockpit C-M1**"", it actually made me pause and go, “wait… this is kinda cool.”

Maybe it’s because I spend a lot of time in my car. Long drives, traffic jams, random late night coffee runs.... my car is basically a second room at this point. So anything that makes that space smarter instantly catches my eye.

The C-M1 feels like the kind of upgrade that would actually make a difference in daily life. It lets the car run **AI** right inside the dashboard, so you can literally talk to it like you talk to your phone. 

I love the idea of asking my car, “Hey dude where’s the nearest open coffee place?” and actually getting a **quick answer** without the awkward silence.

And the **graphics** part? Listen… I’ve had enough of laggy car screens. If this makes everything smoother (from maps to music to whatever the kids watch in the back) I’m all for it.

What really got me though is how it can **recognize who’s driving** and **adjust things automatically**. I can’t tell you how many times someone borrows my car and messes up the seat, mirrors, everything. If my car can fix that for me? Take my money!!!!!

The whole point of this dimensity auto cockpit CM1 is simple.... make the car feel more personal, more aware, and way less dumb.

1p2xj31,https://www.reddit.com/r/ramdass/comments/1p2xj31/ram_dass_a_reluctant_explorers_appreciation/,Ram Dass: A Reluctant Explorer’s Appreciation,"Hello Satsang, Hello Friends,

I want to start by saying I’m writing not as a teacher, or as anyone with any particular wisdom. I’m writing in the spirit of sharing a part of my journey, having found so much comfort in Ram Dass’s teachings and in the community that grew around him and Maharaji.

In other words, I’m approaching this as the Roman philosopher Seneca once wrote, “not as a doctor prescribing a cure. But as a patient in the bed next to you, describing his symptoms.”

I’m curious, too, to know if folks here have experienced something similar to what I’m going to share.

I’d been interested in Buddhism since I was a teenager. When I got to college at eighteen, I had the opportunity to try psilocybin. But the day I was to have my experience, I picked up a book on yogic practice from our community coffee table. The line that stood out to me was “You can’t pull the skin off a snake.” 

Reading that, I realized I wanted the psilocybin experience too much. I wasn’t ready. So I dropped out of the evening, and I didn’t think about psychedelics for a while.

In the time between then and now, I got deeper into meditation, discovered Ram Dass’s books and talks, got married, and started a family. One of the joys of my life has been learning about my wife’s religion and practicing with her. She’s Hindu, was born in India, and we’re raising our daughters in a HindJew family. Ram Dass’s own relationship with the religion of his birth and the religion he arrived at deeply influenced the openness we’re imparting to our daughters.

Then two years ago, at thirty-eight, I had another opportunity to take psilocybin. This time, I didn’t feel like I needed to try it; instead, I felt curious. There wasn’t a craving, only interest.

So I talked it over with my wife, set aside a weekend when she and the girls would be elsewhere (visiting family in India), invited a trusted friend over to mind me, and experimented.

I don’t think I have the eloquence to describe the experience itself. I also suspect that such descriptions can be tiring to read to those who haven’t taken hallucinogens and can feel obvious to those who have. What I will share, if you’ve been kind enough to stick with me so far, are three realizations I had while on my trip.

The first two were figure-ground reversals.

First, I had the overwhelming feeling that I was giving permission for everything to exist exactly the way it was. And that’s a real ego trip, right? To think I’ve control over that. Then, the feeling reversed itself. I understood that if I was giving permission for everything to be exactly as it was, then everything was giving me permission to be exactly as I was. It was a moment of unconditional acceptance. It moved me to tears.

Second, although I knew what I was seeing and experiencing was an illusion, it felt very, very real. If that were the case, then my everyday, waking experience, which felt very, very real, was as much a hallucination. Only, it was the only illusion I’d known up until that point.

Third, and finally, the notion that I was just a wave being temporarily expressed by the ocean moved from something I understood intellectually to something I felt experientially. It migrated from my head to my heart. So there was no need to fear embarrassment, isolation, or death. I wouldn’t seek these things out, but when it’s time for my wave to break against the shore, I now know that it’s okay. Everything’s unfolding as it should, and I’m not going anywhere, even though “I” won’t be around.   

When I came down, and tested myself by boiling a pot of chai (Jivraj-9 with masala) for me and my friend, I felt incredibly grateful for the experience. And yet even today, two years on, I’ve no desire to take another trip. Maybe that’ll change, but for now I don’t feel hooked. It’s like Alan Watts said, I got the message, so I could hang up the phone. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’m curious to read any experiences from the community or thoughts on this. And I’m deeply grateful to Ram Dass and this satsang for providing a framework and space to voice my experience.

Appreciatively,

When we were heading back he was constantly looking at me - you know that type of an blank stare men give when they want to kiss you. It was nothing bad, it was nice he let me know he was interested, even tho he looked like a horny teenager. We said goodbye and I was planning on meeting again 😎

We were sending each other memes on IG, he turned out to have a bit more of a crass humor in general than me and then send me this post on ig:

I told him that i really value good manners and I'm not comfortable being send such reels at this point of a relationship.
He played dumb (in my opinion) and said it's just a pig.
I told him the pig clearly sniffs around private areas of the lady in the video.
He then send me a normal video of that pig but I stopped answearing. We lost contact. 🐷

Trying to determine if we need to let our nanny go. She’s been looking after my 2 kids ages 1 and 3 for about 4 months. She’s here 2 days/week for 5 hours each day. We pay $29/hour regardless of if she watches one or both kids- sometimes I take one of the kids for the day for 1 on 1 time. She isn’t expected to clean anything up or do anything besides watch the kids (obviously). She is a mom in our neighborhood and watches a few other kids here and there. She drives my kids to the library, coffee shop, toddler gym and playground. 

- She really doesn’t like taking them outside, and they’re very happy to go outside, but it’s okay and I understand not wanting to be out with our chickens and ducks and stuff. 

- she gossips a LOT, last time she was here she was on the phone standing on the porch and my toddler opened the door for her and she came in and talked on the phone for a few more mins, then hung up and told me all about the lady on the phone, it was a mom on her kids sports team who wasn’t prepared for something  

- we had agreed on the places she’d take them too, all in our town. One day I found out she was at a store in the next town over and I had no idea. She’s also stopped at her house and left the kids in the car to get stuff like socks for the toddler gym and just told me about it afterwards 

- so we had a talk confirming that she needs to let me know if she’s taking them somewhere new. Anywhere we’ve talked about (library, gym, coffee, etc.) are fine but there are some sketchy areas I don’t want them going to. Then yesterday she texted me while at the library with my kids that her son forgot something he needed for a project by 12pm and she needed to drive to her house (15/20 mins from the library) leave my kids in the car and look for/get the stuff bc she has a giant dog that my kids have never met, then to his school (20 mins from her house) and then return to babysitting activities. Since they had to leave the library early they ended up getting to the class at the toddler gym like 40 minutes early and just walked around the sidewalk of the strip mall for a half hour. 

- I have an AirTag in my baby’s diaper bag bc I keep $ and keys in there. I checked it once and she was at a random store she never told me about. I told her again no more out of town outings unless you run it by me first. I checked the location last week and it was in a random elementary school parking lot next to the library. This morning I was packing the diaper bag for myself for the day and found the AirTag was moved out of the usual spot in the first aid kit, and into a completely different place in the bag. She knows where it is bc I showed her a while ago. No idea why it got moved. 

- she insists on taking them to a gym class that her friend runs. It’s $40 per class during a time there’s a free library class at the same time. She says my kids prefer the gymnastics and I feel like i can’t really argue against it 

- she calls my 1 year old a ‘scutch’ and says stuff like he’s fake crying for attention, ‘oh stop’ and is sometimes snappy with my toddler. Not mean but like mean girl attitude with him sometimes. 

If so, how do I fire her? She’s in my community, is friends with the librarians, etc. And it’s the holidays :/",2,1763728129.0,Mommit,10,1.0,False

I'm a little hesitant to post here but I think it is the case with all of the students. I'm also a student and I have to travel a lot because of studies and I also love travelling. But every time I find myself searching on Google 'is this place safe to go' and I end up with generic reviews and years old threads. There is not a single method to know is place is actually safe and should I visit. This is the case with almost all students who leave their home town for studies.

I remember during my first year I skipped plans because most of my friends were day scholars and I don't want to come back my pg alone . I was so literally so frustrated and have to come back to my pg before 7 most of the times. Every time I want to explore somewhere new or plan a trip, it's the same anxiety: checking five different sources, asking random people, still not knowing for sure. I don't have a big friend group just me and my 2 friends and that's why it still a problem for us!

**Here's what I realized:** nobody tracks the information that actually matters for solo travelers especially women. Not which cafe has good coffee, but whether you'll get harassed walking there alone at 7 PM.

Therefore I'm building a product called Safe or Not, it is a very simple product just type in the location and get women safety, transit safety etc. reviews from crowdsource data. You also have access to latest scams and recent news so you don't have to juggle between posts.

But I need your help to build the community, so you guys can support us if you genuinely like the product by dropping a signup if you can!

[Safe or Not](https://www.safeornot.space/location/44bcd0ef-0f50-482e-8845-ef966cf4c0f2)

Try searching for Delhi or Mumbai and see the magic 🪄

We’re still early (around 123 signups and growing), but what excites us most is building a **community** that helps each other stay informed and safe.

If this resonates with you, I’d love for you to check it out and share your thoughts , especially if you’ve faced similar struggles in a new city.

I left Korea just before Covid and now have returned to find that the wonderful lady and her daughter who used to own that spot no longer are there and it seems to have changed hands. She used to give me a free coffee and let me sit just inside the doorway during rain and cold winter days, to eat my toast and chat with them. Now, it’s an impersonal order kiosk screen at the counter, no personal connection at all, and the toast recipes aren’t as good anymore. Sort of a bummer. Just a fast food takeaway. 
I’m looking for a street cart vendor who does toast in this area. 20 years ago there was a lady in front of that old brick bank building in Insadong down the street from the temple. She’s long gone too. To this day, she made the best toast I’ve ever had.

To be honest I’m feeling okay since I’ve got money that I don’t rush to spend since I have no idea when I will be able to start making money in a healthy manner, but I’m not restricting myself either. Today I bought a coffee, something to eat and tobacco since I’m a smoker disgracefully.
Right now I actually taking things in my hands and I’m getting ready to get my docs in check.
I honestly was living without the documents since I had no idea what I needed them for. Nobody has ever informed me that I had the right to get economically helped by the state, not even the people that were fully informed and receiving the help. I don’t know why they kept quiet. Maybe not to judge me or because they didn’t want to see me doing well. But it doesn’t matter, I don’t blame them. Even though this thought pops up once in a while when n my head.
At the end one has to do everything by herself but it’s ok.
Anyways, I have the right to live a normal life so I will get it. I don’t dream of boats and luxury parties anymore. Honestly I’ve been to some and I never felt good being there so I would drink myself unconscious because it was pretty on the outside but those places usually had the most toxic vibes that I’ve ever seen. It really depends on the context, not judging boats or the luxury, but if it’s a place where the book “girls” it has usually nothing good behind it.
I just want to be able to have a roof over my head, food in my fridge, a stable job that I’m good at and access to the university. Maybe one day I’ll meet the love of my life but honestly from all this trauma I can’t even look men in the eyes nowdays.
Another minus of sex work is that you get disgusted my any man who tries to love you. I’ve had several men try to get with me but I’m disgusted by the fact that they even imagine me without anything on or the fact that I would have to get in bed with them. FOR FREE.
To be honest a fact that not every client would like to read is that during that whole process I hated sex and I still do. I find it disgusting and that’s why I would blur do it for money. Everything that you would see was a mask. A role. I remember lying to my last client how much I’m enjoying sex and how necessary and fun it was for me. It’s so funny. I realised what a good actress I could be if I really need it. 🤣
I have not enjoyed the act. Not one single time.
I stopped enjoying sex since the day that my ex fiancee has raped me while he was high on drugs. I’ve totally shut down after that day.
I’m sorry.

Hi! I’m looking for a dedicated writing partner for a slow-burn story in 3rd person, where replies are usually 3–5 sentences. The goal is a gradual, tension-filled dynamic between two characters whose personalities clash but evolve over time. I write on Discord.

Scene Setup:
The story begins in a cozy, slightly run-down bookstore in a small town. The bookstore owner, organized and introverted, prides themselves on a quiet, calm space for readers. Recently, the shop has added a small coffee counter run by a new barista, whose energetic and messy style clashes with the owner’s orderly routines. The two meet on the first morning the barista arrives: the barista is setting up their station while the owner nervously checks inventory, already irritated by the noise and smell of coffee. Both characters are immediately frustrated with each other, and the tension sets the stage for slow-developing interactions.

Opening scene :

The bell above the shop door jingled far louder than it should have in a place meant for quiet, and (your name here) winced at the sound. She stood behind the front counter with a clipboard tucked under her arm, double-checking inventory while trying to ignore the sudden hiss of the espresso machine warming up. The smell of coffee, rich and intrusive, drifted through the aisles of old paper and dust—an unwelcome guest filling the shop faster than the morning light. She cast a wary glance toward (my name here), the new barista, who was unpacking supplies with noisy enthusiasm, scattering napkins and metal tins across the counter as though chaos were simply part of the job. Jaw tightening, she cleared her throat. “Could you… maybe keep it down a bit? Some of us open the shop quietly.”


Story Goals:
The focus is on how these two very different people navigate sharing the space, their misunderstandings, arguments, and gradual respect. The progression is meant to be slow and detailed, showing character growth and the subtle shifts in their relationship.

If this setup interests you, please message me! I’m looking for someone ready to explore the dynamic and develop the story organically.",1,1763727535.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,0.99,False

The most-awaited top-magazine cover for Ahaan has been completely mishandled. One major opportunity — wasted due to avoidable missteps.

1. Restructure the Current Team

It’s time to replace the outdated approach.
Hire a team that understands Gen Z, digital culture, and modern audience behaviour.
This is not the 90s or 2000s — the industry landscape has changed, and so must the strategy.

2. Stop Trying to Control Natural On-Screen Chemistry

Every iconic Bollywood pair has been loved on screen and off screen.
Trying to control or restrict this only backfires.
Let the organic sentiment breathe — it strengthens audience connection and boosts brand visibility.

3. Conduct an Internal Strategy Meeting

Sit down with a clear head, coffee, and a whiteboard.
Create a proper promotional plan and even a structured PPT for:

Brand Ahaan

Brand Aneet

The Ahneet pairing’s marketing roadmap


One mishap should not lead to panic-driven decisions or sudden pr driven articles,looks fake

Your mismanagement is directly affecting Ahaan’s brand value — and by extension, Aneet’s.
Please think through the repercussions and avoid situations or interview questions that could create unnecessary chaos.

I really hope it’s okay to post this. I read through the rules before posting and I don’t think I’m breaking any, I’m really sorry if I do. 

I’ve been a stay at home mum for a long time, and hadn’t worked in nearly 20 years (since I was a teenager). I Was diagnosed earlier this year with autism and adhd. My family of four have been living off my husbands income forever but it’s just not sustainable anymore, our finances are so bad we never have more than $100 in savings and it’s always gone by the end of each pay week. 

I’ve spent the last year and a half getting my official diagnosis (after suspecting for years), so I could try to access some government funded disability support, like a disability employment service and access to more mental health care and support. I was rejected because apparently I don’t need enough support because I’ve “managed” 30-something years without it?

Anyway, I decided to try to get a job on my own. I have a little experience in retail, ideally I would’ve liked to try packing or stacking shelves or something with minimal human interaction but I kept getting rejected. So I resorted to applying at fast food places. More rejections, then finally I got an interview at pretty popular fast food chain. The interview was three weeks ago. 

The manager liked me and called me in for a second interview, and the next day they offered me the job. They said I would be starting on registers and packing orders, then drive thru, then frying/kitchen, and eventually hoping to work up to a day shift manager. 

First shift on Monday evening, packing orders and taking a few orders at the counter, and cashing a few drive thru orders, learning the registers and what items come in what meal. It was a lot to handle, but I coped okay and thought, yep shouldn’t take long to get used to this, in a couple of weeks I think I’ll feel much more at ease. 

Second shift on Wednesday, more of the same, except triple as busy. But I still coped okay and started feeling more confident in what I had already learned and less intimidated by what I still had left to learn, but struggled to function at home after. Didn’t seem to be able to speak to my husband or kids at all for the rest of the night. 

Third shift on Thursday…. They put me on drive thru. With a headset. During peak dinner rush. My trainer goofed and didn’t follow the bosses instructions with having me only on drive thru for the night, my trainer threw me out at the front counter, as well as expected me to be aware and responding to cars approaching the drive thru. 
Boss told my trainer off and sent me back to the drive thru. 

Along with my autism, I have to deal with auditory processing disorder. I had to ask every customer in the drive thru to repeat themselves at least twice, sometimes even more. When ordering a roast chicken meal one meanie goes “A LEG PIECE, GENIUS!” after I said “I’m so sorry, I’m learning, would you mind repeating that one more time?” But I didn’t even freak out at the rudeness. I brushed it off and moved on (very unlike me)

But the noise. Every time I misheard or couldn’t hear a customer, my brain would scream louder and louder. By the end of my shift I was having to squeeze my shoulders into my chest to stop my whole body shaking and bite the insides of my cheeks to stop from crying every time I saw a car approach the speaker. I felt more and more like I was going to vomit or fall to the ground with each customer. 

Then the boss told me that as of next week, I’ll be doing all of it (for longer shifts) and won’t have a trainer. There will be one other person around to help but I would be expected to be able to serve customers at the front checkout (using a register I’m obviously not very familiar with at all and have no idea yet what each meal includes when people ask “what can I get with a roast and vegetables or what packs come with fried chicken and mash potato, sweet potato and peas or whatever else), pack those orders, keep track of and pack uber online orders and hand them out to the drivers assigned to that order (there can be up to 7 different orders and uber drivers at a time) take, cash, pack and hand out drive thru orders all while this headset is screaming in my ear constantly and my brain is screaming even louder. AND learning all the cleaning jobs around the restaurant as well and learning when and how they need to be done and coordinating that amongst all the serving at two different spots and packing and internal screaming. 

I walked out the door at the end of my shift to where my husband was parked waiting to take me home and just cried. This was 9.15pm last night. It’s now 9.17pm the following night and I’ve not stopped crying since for longer than 20 minutes at a time. 

All last night I kept waking myself up crying in my sleep. Woke up this morning with instant fear of going back tonight for my next shift. Not just dread of having to go to work, full on fear and feeling like if I walk into that building again I’ll die. 

Did what I had to do to get my kids off to school, came home and had a coffee with my sister, then she went home and I sat on my couch for a couple of hours and tried to play my comfort game. Ended up just staring at a wall for ages. 

Some loud noise outside snapped me back to present. I got up to see what happened and saw on the clock that it was only 5 hours until I had to go back. I started screaming and fell to the floor. The last thing I remember is messaging my sister to say please help me. Next thing I know she’s there with me wiping my face with a cold cloth and holding a huge pile of my hair. She said she had been there for a while before I actually seemed to notice her and stop scream-crying. She found me on my chair rocking and screaming and clawing at my arms with a bunch of my hair ripped out all over me and the floor.

She stayed with me a while and I eventually started to calm down a bit but when she asked if I thought it will get easier in time, I started screaming again don’t make me go back don’t make me go back. She just said okay, I think you need to message your boss. 

After a bit when I could actually use my hands properly again I messaged my boss and apologised for wasting her time but I don’t think I can come back as I’m not coping. She said no worries and wished me well. But I still just keep crying. 

The panic or whatever the heck that was today has eased, I still have this overwhelming feeling of wanting to go home (even though I am home??)  the last three weeks are such a blur. I’ve only ever experienced a panic that intense once before right after my mum died, and even that wasn’t as bad as this was. It was the most horrible thing I’ve ever experienced. 

I have no idea what I’m hoping to accomplish with this post. Validation? Advice maybe? Will it be like this with any job or was this type of job just incompatible with my mental health or whatever? I just want to help provide for our kids and keep a roof over our heads. Now I feel like everything’s completely hopeless. That because of me we will never stop struggling financially because I can’t figure out how to function like everyone else. ",14,1763727264.0,AutisticAdults,5,0.9,False
