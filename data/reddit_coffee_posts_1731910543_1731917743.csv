I‚Äôm 29 (F) I‚Äôve been with my high school sweetheart since our senior year, and we married in 2022. A few years ago I started questioning my sexuality 

I was raised to be a christian and later realized all the times I felt my thoughts about masc-presenting girls were ‚Äúsinful‚Äù so I suppressed those feelings. One time in high school my two friends who are lesbian told me that I have gay vibes and I‚Äôll never forget trying to process that and googling ‚Äúam I gay.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve become more comfortable in my bisexuality since then, so I came out to my husband. He was/is very supportive. I explained to him that it sucks I‚Äôll never be able to experience being with a girl. He quickly said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not true‚Äù and we later agreed that he‚Äôs comfortable with me kissing/dancing with other girls platonically. 

A few years later, in walks my new coworker. She is so attractive and I really want to kiss her. She has good vibes and tattoos and everything :))). We get along very well at work (we work in a coffee shop). We keep telling each other the other is cute in subtle ways and send each other funny reels on instagram often. 

My question to you is.. I don‚Äôt know how to be open about my sexuality to her when she knows I‚Äôm married to a man. I‚Äôve not yet confirmed her sexuality (she keeps alluding that ‚Äòmen are trash‚Äô and recently got out of a relationship with a man???) and yet her vibes with me are really flirtatious. Also being coworkers crosses a boundary too. So what do you think, should we keep things the way they are (flirty and cordial as coworkers) or try to cautiously and consensually cross the boundary?

Been drinking daily for 15 years, and since 2021 I‚Äôve tried quitting thousands of times, giving up at day 4. 

I don‚Äôt know how this time was different, but I picked a date to stop, had my ‚Äòfinal farewell drink‚Äô and somehow it stuck. 

In 7 weeks I‚Äôve had bad days in work, celebrated a birthday, lost a loved one and had the funeral (big family of drinkers so everyone got drunk after the funeral) and hundreds more things that I would‚Äôve used as an excuse to drink. 

Weirdly, the hardest time for me so far was getting my results from the doctors. I recently had blood work and an ultrasound on my liver, and was told last week that all my levels had come down to normal range and my liver was just ‚Äòslightly fatty‚Äô. That day I had the strongest urges to drink because ‚ÄòI am now fixed‚Äô. To celebrate the news, my wife and I ordered an Indian takeaway. When I went to pick it up, I walked into the restaurant and the owner said ‚Äúoh hello Chubby313! While you wait I‚Äôll get you a pint!‚Äù (Every time I pick up my Indian takeaway, he always gives me 1 or 2 free beers while I wait)‚Ä¶ I hesitated and said ‚Äúno, no thank you, working early tomorrow!‚Äù. 
Turning down that free drink was the biggest personal achievement for me, especially coz while I was making my way there, I knew it was going to happen and I wasn‚Äôt sure how I was going to handle it.

I took a selfie on day 1, I was 15 stone (95kg). I took a selfie this morning and weighed myself, I am 13 stone (82kg). My face is no longer bloated and I‚Äôve made new notches in my belt. (I‚Äôve also been eating healthier and cut out sugar all together. Black coffee is actually nice now)

My bank account looks amazing, the day before payday I‚Äôm usually cutting it, but I‚Äôve got a few hundred left over this month, plus I‚Äôve bought extra Christmas presents and paid off all the credit I used to have. Wish I started this years ago now, my life and financial situation could‚Äôve been so much different. 

Writing this so I can come back a read how positive I‚Äôm feeling today, if I start doubting my decision to stop drinking

She has almost all of the same values and perspectives as me and will try and be there for you when you need it. Her one thing, that drives me up the wall, is she is possibly one of the least generous people I've ever met.

First time I noticed it was I threw a drinks and dinner night at mine (5 minutes drive from hers, 15 from the city centre where the rest of our friends are coming from). Everyone got quite drunk and when trying to figure out how to get back to the city, she offered her boyfriend to drive them back for ¬£15, the cost of a cab. I remembered thinking that was a bit much to charge your drunk friends to get home safe, but figured it was the bf.

Next time we went out, everyone bought each other rounds, except for her. Told myself it was just money related.

I asked her to come feed my cats one night (less than 4 miles away from her) and she said she would do it for ¬£15 (not a professional sitter).she has since not once popped by to help with the cats, even when offered 20+ for it, just because of the inconvenience of driving over and feeding them üôÑ

Finally, my car has been having issues recently. It broke down and cost me ¬£500 to fix. A week later, and my engine light has come back on. Her boyfriend owns a diagnostic reader and it would take him 45 seconds to tell me the problem, saving me a ¬£70 garage visit just to diagnose it. Again, despite living less than 4 miles from me, it's just not possible for them to take less than 10 minutes out of their day to help.

I come from a family (and culture) where generosity is really important. You drive your friends to the airport, you show up on moving day with a packing box, you always make sure they're fed and happy and you definitely offer your expertise if it can help. I'm having such a hard time understanding how someone can be so kind in other ways, but so unwilling to give in others. I didn't blink when she was in a car accident and needed someone to pick her up, I've never second guessed getting her a coffee when I get mine, even if I don't have much money to spare.

1gtzni3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gtzni3/aitah_for_calling_my_coworker_lazy/,AITAH for calling my coworker lazy?,"A little back story, I am 30 yrs old (female) and I work at a very known hotel in the state/town I live in. It is one of the most popular hotels in my town, usually full even during the slow season. I work overnights at the front desk. I have been with this company for about 4 months. When I first started this job, this hotel recently got bought by a new company. With new companies there are always new changes. I know this due to past experiences. 

Every day I work, I set up breakfast for the breakfast attendants due to most of the items needing to be out by 3 am. I don't mind setting things out. The issue I have is the weekend breakfast attendants. Every Sunday night that I come to work, I go to set up breakfast and there is a mess left in the kitchen. I am talking dirty dishes that have been sitting out all day, the sink never being washed out so think of slimy, stinky, old hard food and grime sitting at the bottom of a giant sink covering the whole bottom. Then there is the breakfast area that things get left out all the time. Usually, the signs for the breakfast items, and often the half and half container with the milk still in it gets left out all day. There are mor issues, but these are what I can think of at the moment.

I know a lot of this sounds superficial and not a big deal; but when you have to do this so often you start getting irritated by it.

Well, I decided to find out who was causing most of these issues. I found out who it was in 2 weeks because they worked on a weekday where we don't usually have more than 1 breakfast attendant and the exact same issues happened on those days. We will call the person Bob (not real name). 

I started documenting the messes and issues to show my manager and when I did, I was told to ""just don't worry about cleaning up after those messes."" ""Just worry about your work and ignore those messes"". ""They are new JJ (Me, not real name), it's going to take them time to get the hang of everything"". I reminded my manager that I cannot ignore these issues because I am unable to do my job unless these things are done/clean. Also, this person started working here 2 weeks after I did, so no, they are not new.

My manager asked me to let her deal with this, so I did. After another month passed of these things happening, I stopped doing the things I needed to that involved cleaning up after this coworker. My manager did not seem to care either way. Thankfully, I rarely ever saw this guy due to the days he worked never matched the nights I worked. (He would work Sunday morning, and I would work Sunday night, but he never worked Monday morning and so forth.) 

Unfortunately, our main breakfast attendant just had a baby and was out on paternity leave, so, Bob was covering a couple shifts, which meant, I had to actually see him. I decided that I was going to be civil and remain calm. That morning was a pretty slow morning for both of us, but I had a guest ask about more cups and coffee from the coffee station and I let them know that I would find the breakfast attendant. I found Bob in the storage closet trying to close a play pen. Out of curiosity, I asked him what he was doing and if he needs any help. He then goes, ""Why are you always asking me fucking questions, it's fucking annoying"". Now this confused me because we never work in the mornings together, so I was unsure what he meant by always asking him questions and I told him that I like to ask questions while keeping my composure. He then tells me that he's trying to get the playpen out of his way. I said, ""isn't that playpen usually there""? (Due to the last 4 weeks of it being there). Bob then says, ""No it's not usually fucking here; I work every fucking day"". (No, he does not work every day, he only works 3 days a week). 

I completely understand being irritated and cussing, but I am not okay with someone cussing at me. So, I went off in a very creepy calm way. I told him that if he worked here every day, then I would be more miserable because I would have to clean up even more due to him being too lazy to do his job and that he should be worrying about getting coffee and cups out there for the guests and not worry about a playpen. Then I walked out.

Not just lonely, but truly, utterly alone. I‚Äôve never had a friend to call my own. My father died when I was eight, leaving my mother to raise me on her own. There were no siblings, no distant cousins, no extended family dropping by to fill the empty spaces. To this day, I‚Äôm not even sure if anyone else in my family exists outside of her.

She was all I had, and she never let me forget it. ""The world is dangerous,"" she would say, her voice low and firm, as though even speaking too loudly might invite unseen threats. That was her excuse for keeping me isolated, for not allowing me to have friends. Not that it mattered‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt exactly attract people anyway. At school, I was the outcast, the one everyone avoided, like they could sense something was wrong with me. Something broken.

The day after my high school graduation, cancer finally claimed her. It was slow, silent, and inevitable, like the world had decided to erase her in the same quiet way it had erased every other connection in my life. And with her gone, I was truly alone.

I tried to make a life for myself, but it was like patching together a broken mirror‚Äîevery reflection of me was distorted. I hopped from one odd job to the next: baggage handler at the supermarket, flipping burgers at the diner, delivering meat for a factory. None of it stuck. None of it made me feel any less invisible. I thought maybe working around people would force me to connect, but no one even noticed me. I felt like a ghost, drifting between the living.

My last job‚Äîcleaning animal excrement‚Äîwas a fitting end to that chapter of my life. It was, quite literally, a crappy job. I was fired after three months, but honestly, I didn‚Äôt care. By then, I had stopped expecting anything from life.

That‚Äôs when I saw the ad online.

*Looking for a sharp eye and discretion. No experience required. Join Undercover Inc.*

I didn‚Äôt even think twice before applying. The job was to follow people. That‚Äôs it. Tail them, watch them, report back. It should‚Äôve raised a few red flags, but at that point, I wasn‚Äôt fazed by much of anything. What should it matter? I was just a nobody anyway.

The interview was held in an unmarked building on the outskirts of the city. Its exterior was unremarkable‚Äîgray walls, no signage, and windows tinted so dark they felt more like voids. I almost walked past it, thinking I had the wrong place, but the text on my phone confirmed the address.

Inside, the air was thick, the kind of silence that swallowed sound whole. A receptionist, who barely looked up from her desk, pointed me toward a single door at the end of a long hallway. I don‚Äôt know why, but every step I took made my stomach churn a little more.

The room I entered was small, with stark fluorescent lights that buzzed faintly overhead. A man sat behind a desk, wearing a suit that seemed one size too big for him. His face was pale, his hair slicked back, and his eyes‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt blink as much as they should.

""Take a seat,"" he said, motioning to the only chair in the room.

I sat. The chair creaked beneath me, loud enough to make me flinch.

He leaned forward, his thin lips curling into a smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach his eyes. ""You‚Äôre here for the position?""

I nodded.

He glanced at a paper on the desk, though it seemed blank from where I was sitting. ""No experience, I see. Perfect. We don‚Äôt like people who know too much.""

I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond, so I stayed quiet.

His gaze met mine, sharp and unwavering. ""Tell me, have you ever felt like you‚Äôre being watched?""

The question caught me off guard. ""Uh‚Ä¶ not really.""

""Interesting,"" he murmured, scribbling something on the blank paper. ""And do you believe in coincidence?""

I hesitated. ""I‚Ä¶ I guess?""

He tapped his pen against the desk, the rhythm irregular, almost agitating. ""You guess. Hmm. Tell me, if you had to follow someone for weeks, months even, and they started to‚Ä¶ notice you, would that scare you?""

I blinked. ""I don‚Äôt think so?""

His smile widened, showing teeth that were just a bit too straight, too white. ""Good. Fear complicates things.""

""Is this‚Ä¶ normal for the job?"" I finally asked, unable to keep the unease out of my voice.

""There‚Äôs nothing normal about life, wouldn‚Äôt you agree?"" He leaned back, his shadow stretching across the desk like it was alive. ""Last question. If the person you were following looked directly at you and asked, Who are you? Why are you here?‚Äîwhat would you say?""

I froze, the hypothetical question feeling heavier than it should. ""I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.""

He clapped his hands together once, the sound echoing too loud in the tiny room. ""Perfect answer. You‚Äôre hired.""

""Just like that?""

""Just like that,"" he said, standing up and extending his hand. His grip was cold, like shaking hands with a mannequin. ""Welcome to Undercover Inc. Your first assignment will arrive tomorrow. Don‚Äôt worry about the details‚Äîyou‚Äôll get them when you need them. Just be ready.""

I left the building with the strangest feeling, like I‚Äôd just signed a contract without reading the fine print. And a

s I stepped back into the city‚Äôs bustling streets, I couldn‚Äôt shake the sensation that someone was already following me.

The next morning, my phone buzzed with a new email. It was from Undercover Inc.,

I opened it immediately, half-expecting more cryptic questions or vague instructions. Instead, it was surprisingly straightforward:

Details:

Name: Henry L. Newman

Age: 46

Occupation: Accountant

Address: 218 Waverly Drive

Assignment Duration: 7 days

Objective: Document his day-to-day activities. Submit a report at the end of each day.

Compensation: $22/hour

Note: Do not approach the subject or engage in conversation. Maintain distance and observe discreetly.

$22 an hour. I couldn‚Äôt help but let out a low whistle. That was more than I‚Äôd ever made at any of my previous jobs, and all I had to do was follow some guy around? Easy money, or so it seemed.

The email also included an attachment‚Äîa photo of Henry. It was a grainy image, like something taken from a security camera. He looked average: thinning hair, glasses perched on his nose, and a slight slouch to his posture. There was nothing remarkable about him, just an ordinary man in an ordinary blazer.

Still, something about the lack of information gnawed at me. Why was I supposed to follow him? Why him, out of all people? But the email had been clear‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt paid to ask questions.

I clicked on the address link, which opened a map. Henry lived in a small suburban neighborhood about 20 minutes away from me. I didn‚Äôt have a car, but the bus route was direct enough. I jotted down the directions and set a reminder for tomorrow morning.

The rest of the day felt surreal. I kept rereading the email, trying to glean some hidden meaning, but there was nothing there. The instructions were almost clinical in their simplicity.

Who was Henry L. Newman?

And why would anyone care about his ""day-to-day activities""?

I looked up the address on my laptop. 218 Waverly Drive was part of a quiet cul-de-sac, lined with trimmed hedges and identical white mailboxes. Perfectly normal.

Maybe he was under investigation? Maybe someone thought he was hiding something? But if that were the case, wouldn‚Äôt this be a police matter? My mind spun with possibilities until I finally forced myself to stop. None of it mattered. All I had to do was watch, report, and collect my paycheck.

For the first time in years, I felt a small flicker of excitement. Sure, it was a weird job, but it was something different. Something I hadn‚Äôt done before. And the money wasn‚Äôt bad, either.

Tomorrow, I‚Äôd meet Henry L. Newman‚Äînot literally, of course. Just from a distance. I‚Äôd watch his life unfold for a week and, hopefully, learn nothing more than what I needed to know.

The next morning, I was up before my alarm. A mix of nervousness and curiosity pushed me out of bed earlier than usual. After a quick breakfast, I grabbed a notebook and pen‚Äîtools I hadn‚Äôt been instructed to bring but figured might be useful‚Äîand headed for the bus stop.

The ride to Waverly Drive was uneventful, the kind of quiet suburban scenery you see in real estate brochures. By the time I got off the bus, the sun was creeping higher in the sky, casting long shadows over the pristine neighborhood.

I found 218 Waverly Drive easily enough. It was exactly as Google Maps had shown: a modest, two-story home with beige siding, a neatly trimmed lawn, and a single, leafless tree in the front yard. A black sedan was parked in the driveway. Nothing about the house stood out‚Äîno glaring oddities, no ominous vibe. It was just... normal.

I settled on a bench at the small park across the street, positioned behind a pair of large oak trees that gave me a clear view of the house while keeping me hidden.

At 8:07 a.m., the front door opened, and Henry stepped out.

He was even more unremarkable in person: a middle-aged man with an average build, wearing a beige jacket and slacks. He carried a brown leather briefcase in one hand and a travel mug in the other. He walked to the black sedan, got in, and backed out of the driveway with the precision of someone who‚Äôd done it a thousand times before.

I followed him by bus as best as I could, keeping track of his movements through the streets. He drove to a small, nondescript office building downtown and disappeared inside. I noted the time‚Äî8:37 a.m.‚Äîand decided to hang around.

For the next eight hours, Henry did exactly what you‚Äôd expect an accountant to do.

I watched from a caf√© across the street as he sat at his desk, visible through the large office window. He worked on his computer, shuffled papers, and occasionally answered the phone. At noon, he stepped out to grab a sandwich from the deli next door, then returned to eat at his desk.

By 5:15 p.m., he left the building and drove straight home. No stops, no detours. Once inside, he pulled the curtains shut, and I lost sight of him.

I scribbled my notes into the notebook and emailed the day‚Äôs report:

Subject: Day 1 Report

Time Observed: 8:07 a.m. ‚Äì 5:37 p.m.

Notes: Subject left residence at 8:07 a.m., arrived at workplace at 8:37 a.m. Routine office work observed. Lunch break at 12:15 p.m. Returned home at 5:37 p.m. No anomalies.

It felt... mundane. Almost too mundane. I‚Äôd expected something to stand out‚Äîa suspicious meeting, strange behavior, anything. But Henry‚Äôs day was painfully average.

As I lay in bed that night, my thoughts spiraled. Why did someone want me to follow Henry? What was the point? It didn‚Äôt make sense.

Still, it was just the first day. Maybe tomorrow would reveal more. Or maybe I‚Äôd find out that normalcy itself could be the most unsettling thing of all.

The week following Henry L. Newman was mind-numbingly dull‚Äîat first. Each day began the same way: he‚Äôd leave his neatly kept home on Waverly Drive at precisely 8:07 a.m., briefcase in hand, travel mug at the ready. He‚Äôd drive to his bland office downtown, where he‚Äôd sit at his desk, immersed in spreadsheets and phone calls. By noon, he‚Äôd grab a sandwich from the deli next door, eat at his desk, and continue his work until clocking out around 5:15 p.m.

The first few days felt pointless. Henry seemed utterly ordinary, almost frustratingly so. But by midweek, something shifted.

Wednesday, instead of heading straight home after work, Henry turned off the main road and parked outside a dimly lit motel on the edge of town. My heart raced as I watched him exit his car and walk briskly to Room 214. Fifteen minutes later, a woman joined him‚Äîblonde, younger, and definitely not his wife. They stayed inside for an hour before leaving separately.

Thursday was a repeat performance. The woman arrived at the motel before Henry this time, dressed in business casual but with a certain air of secrecy. I jotted down every detail, my stomach twisting as I realized what I was witnessing.

By Friday, their routine was clear: the clandestine meetings weren‚Äôt a fluke. Henry had built a double life, his mundane facade hiding something far more complicated.

Each night, I submitted my reports, carefully leaving out the affair. Something about it felt... wrong. Was this really the purpose of my job? To expose secrets that weren‚Äôt mine to uncover?

By the end of the week, I didn‚Äôt just know Henry‚Äôs patterns‚ÄîI knew his lies. And I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that someone was watching me just as closely.

My next assignment was for Marcy L. Durant. The file painted her as a chameleon‚Äîa fraudster and con artist who changed identities like others changed clothes. From fake charities to elaborate romance scams, Marcy left a trail of empty bank accounts and shattered lives. The email offered little else: a photo of a smiling brunette with sharp eyes, a list of addresses that spanned three states, and a single instruction‚Äî""Track her movements. No direct contact.""

She wasn‚Äôt too much exciting, just a mere fraudster. But the more the most exciting assignment for me after three or four more assignments was the one for a guy named Ethan Cross. He was a creepy guy. This is what the email showed me.

Details:

Name: Ethan Cross

Age: 38

Occupation: Unknown

Address: (REDACTED)

Assignment Duration: 7 days

Objective: Follow and document his day-to-day activities. Report any irregular or suspicious behavior.

Compensation: $30/hour

Note: This assignment is different. Trust your instincts. Keep your distance and observe discreetly, but be cautious‚Äîsomething about this subject doesn‚Äôt sit right. We don‚Äôt have any concrete evidence of criminal activity yet, but we suspect there‚Äôs more than meets the eye. You‚Äôll understand why soon enough. Do not approach or engage with the subject.

The first day I followed Ethan Cross, I felt a sense of unease, though I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint exactly why. He looked normal‚Äîalmost too normal. A tall, well-dressed man with slicked-back hair and a black overcoat, like someone stepping out of an old noir film. The kind of guy who would command attention just by walking into a room. He exuded an effortless charm, greeting everyone with a smile that felt a little too practiced, a little too perfect.

Ethan's routine was oddly structured, almost mechanical. He left his house promptly at 8:00 a.m., grabbed a coffee from the same caf√© each day, and always spoke with the barista by name, as though they were old friends. Yet, there was something off about it. His interactions were too smooth, his gestures too rehearsed. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was playing a part‚Äîa role he‚Äôd perfected over the years.

I followed him to his office building, a sleek, glass-and-steel structure downtown. He wasn‚Äôt listed as an employee there, yet he walked inside like he owned the place. I waited outside, watching as he disappeared into the lobby, not once glancing over his shoulder. Hours later, he reappeared, briefcase in hand, his demeanor unchanged, as if nothing had happened.

I continued to follow him the next few days, noting his frequent visits to a nearby hotel. Each time, he seemed to be checking into a different room, leaving after a few hours with the same calm demeanor. Who was he meeting? What was he doing there?

On the fourth day, I saw him leave the hotel with a woman‚Äîher features hidden by a dark scarf‚Äîbut I caught a glimpse of her face as she entered the black sedan with him. She looked... frightened. And that‚Äôs when I started to realize that Ethan Cross wasn‚Äôt just charming‚Äîhe was dangerous. The cracks in his perfect fa√ßade were starting to show, and I was beginning to wonder if I was just a witness, or if I was becoming part of something far darker.

By the fifth day, the unease in my gut had turned into something far more intense. Ethan Cross‚Äôs charm was no longer just a performance‚Äîit was a mask. A carefully constructed front that hid something far more sinister. The more I observed him, the more I noticed things that didn‚Äôt add up. Small things, like the way his reflection in the store window never seemed to match his movements exactly, or the strange way his voice would fluctuate when he spoke to certain people, as though he wasn‚Äôt entirely present.

The hotel visits were becoming more frequent. But it wasn‚Äôt just the oddity of his schedule that unsettled me‚Äîit was his demeanor. Every time he returned to his car, there would be blood on his coat sleeve, a faint smear at his collar, like he had been handling something he shouldn‚Äôt have. I wanted to believe I was imagining it, but when I started to follow him further, I couldn‚Äôt ignore the growing evidence.

On the sixth day, I followed him again, but this time, I made sure to stay farther back. He led me to an abandoned building on the edge of town‚Äîan old warehouse with rusted metal doors and boarded-up windows. I watched from across the street, too far to be seen but close enough to catch the faintest of movements. Ethan entered the building, and I waited, my mind racing with possibilities.

Two hours later, I saw him leave, but he wasn‚Äôt alone. A woman stumbled out of the building, disoriented and shaking. She was wearing the same dark scarf I‚Äôd seen before, but this time, it was covered in blood. Her eyes were wide with terror, and her clothes were torn, as though she‚Äôd fought to get away. Ethan, his usual calm demeanor unwavering, calmly walked her to his car. As he opened the door for her, I saw it. There was no fear in his eyes, just something... hollow. As if he were detached, performing a task, not as a man, but as something else entirely.

I followed him again that night. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was on the verge of uncovering something far darker than I could comprehend. As the hours passed, I kept seeing the same patterns: women, often from the same hotels, disappearing into that warehouse. But something in the back of my mind kept nagging at me.

When I reported my findings back to my employers, Ethan Cross was gone. He seemed to have vanished into thin air, like he never existed at all. There was no trace of him, no sign that anyone had ever seen him. The warehouse was abandoned, desolate. It was as if the world had wiped him from its memory. But it wasn‚Äôt just him. Every single person I had been tasked with following‚ÄîHenry Newman, the fraudster, the woman I had watched, the others‚Äîhad disappeared too. Like they were nothing more than figments of my imagination, erased from existence.

I sat there, staring at the computer screen, a strange emptiness settling in the pit of my stomach. I scrolled through the reports, trying to make sense of what had happened, but there were no answers. The assignments had just‚Ä¶ ended. No more updates, no more instructions. Like everything had been scrubbed from the records.

But it didn‚Äôt matter to me. I had done my job. I had followed the orders, observed every detail, documented the patterns. It wasn‚Äôt my responsibility to figure out the why, the how, or the what next. My employers paid me for my discretion, for my ability to follow without asking questions. They didn‚Äôt pay me to care. They paid me to work, to remain anonymous, to keep my head down and do as I was told.

And that‚Äôs what I did. No questions, no thoughts about the strange disappearances, the eerie feeling I had whenever I looked back at my notes. It was over, and I had my paycheck. That‚Äôs all that mattered. It was just another assignment, another job done.

I shut down my computer, grabbed my coat, and walked out into the night. The city felt colder than usual, but maybe that was just me. Either way, I didn‚Äôt care.

I've been doing this job for a while now, long enough that it‚Äôs become a part of me. Not just something I do to pay the bills, but something I‚Äôve woven into the fabric of my existence. I‚Äôve become so good at it that it no longer feels like work. It feels like living in the shadows‚Äîwhere no one can see me, and I can see everything. Like a ghost, I move unnoticed, slipping between people and places without leaving a trace.

I don‚Äôt even think about it anymore. I‚Äôve mastered the art of blending in, of becoming invisible. It‚Äôs a skill, one that I‚Äôve honed over time. The art of observation, of moving without being noticed, of being present without ever being acknowledged. People look right past me now. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not even there. Sometimes, they‚Äôll glance behind them, a flicker of suspicion in their eyes, but by the time they turn around, I‚Äôve already disappeared into the crowd, swallowed up by the dark. They never really see me. They just feel something, a fleeting sense of something there, and then it‚Äôs gone.

I‚Äôve become a shadow, a part of the background. And in a strange way, it‚Äôs comforting. I don‚Äôt need to be seen. I don‚Äôt need to be remembered. I don‚Äôt even need to exist in any meaningful way. I‚Äôve become a master of my own disappearance. I‚Äôm not even sure if I care about anything anymore.

This job‚Äîit‚Äôs consumed me. It‚Äôs all I have now. I follow, I observe, and then I report. I don‚Äôt ask questions. I don‚Äôt question why I‚Äôm doing it. There‚Äôs a numbness to it, an emptiness that I‚Äôve come to accept. And the more I do it, the more I sink into it, the more I feel like I‚Äôm slipping away. Like I‚Äôm fading, becoming less and less of a person, more of a presence, a faint outline in the corners of the world that no one notices.

I‚Äôve learned to embrace it. This life in the dark. It‚Äôs my world now, the only one I know. And as long as I keep moving through it, I‚Äôll stay invisible. Unseen. Unnoticed. A ghost in the crowd.

1gtzl0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1gtzl0l/how_can_i_tell_if_this_girl_is_romantically/,How can I tell if this girl is romantically interested in me or not?,"So theres a lot of context behind this, if you're interested or have a question about it just comment and I'll provide additional information if that helps to answer the question.

  
So this girl and I had a first ""date"", I had never been on a date before or even spoken to somebody in a romantic context, I'm a bit socially inept, I'm autistic and have a hard time adapting to unfamiliar social situations, I'm fine when interacting with platonic friends and in a professional environment, but I had never been in a romantic situation before so I was kind of lost haha.

  
So it's hard to say this without giving full context, but we had an argument while trying to schedule a date because she has a very dynamic work schedule, like changing day of. She never communicated that with me and I thought she was toying with me when she kept cancelling and not giving me days that worked for her schedule and got a little pissy about it, we resolved it and she said she'd be cool with just being friends and seeing if something develops from it, so we end up talking for about a week as friends. Eventually, I ask if shes free sometime during the week to get a cup of coffee, and she said shes actually free in a couple hours so we make it happen.



On our first date we got coffee and walked through a local nature reserve, we kind of talked about random stuff, work, hobbies, aspirations, and childhood trauma, which we really connected with. My parents used to physically abuse me until I was 13 and my older brother protected me by threatening to kill my parents then himself. Shes the eldest sibling and did a similar thing, her sister had been cutting and her parents had no idea, so she threatened calling cps, (her parents were also abusive). We both felt like we really bonded during it but we never had any physical contact during it, but that was likely because I was too awkward to try going in for a hug after she said she wanted to hug me after I talked about my parental situation lmao. She said she'd be down to go out another time as well.

  
After about 4 days of trying to find times that work for both of us, I randomly get a call from her in the middle of my shift (she had never called me before) asking if I was busy, which I was, so she said damn nevermind. after my shift (which ended at 10pm) at like 2:30 in the morning while I'm gaming with friends, I get a text from her asking what I was up to. she was planning to ask me if I wanted to join her at her friends house party about 2 hours away, but she went with one of her other guy friends instead because I was busy (also because her car is in the shop atm). he bailed on her because he didn't like her friends after about 10 minutes and just left her stranded 2 hours away. Honestly I thought it sounded fun and do random impulsive stuff all the time, so I decided to drive down and pick her up, I get there at like 5 am, shes drunk, we get some mcdonalds and talk on the 2 hour drive back.

  
We talked about a bunch of random shit, but she said at one point that she was resisting the urge to call her ex while she was drinking, I said something about how I wish I had an ex, she said that shes had like 8 exes and that she regrets every single one of them, she had 2 long term ones and 6 short term ones she wasn't serious about, and that she wished she was still a virgin and didn't sleep with any of them. I said something along the lines of ""I wish I had at least experienced being in a relationship. I feel so lonely sometimes and feel like I can't share my feelings with my guy friends, it's kind of out of the scope of male friendships if that makes sense "" she said that even after being in 8 relationships, she feels the same way, that she hasn't had a real connection with somebody and that she also feels lonely. Then she said that she felt like we had a special connection, that she liked spending time with me, which gave me the warm and fuzzy feelings a little bit, but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to interpret that. Is that like a romantic thing to say? or just a close friend kind of thing to say?

  
Does that mean she sees me in a romantic way? I have always had self esteem issues and can't see myself in a romantic light, or imagine someone else seeing me that way. She did say before that she'd be cool proceeding as just friends so I'm not sure if we had crossed that boundary from platonic-romantic, neither of us really specified. I'm not even sure if she considers our nature walk a ""date"", but maybe I'm just too unfamiliar with romantic situations? Should I just ask her if she sees me as a relationship interest? is that too forward? otherwise I could just ask something tomorrow like ""sushi date later today?"" (I'm assuming shes off work because of her car issue) and see if she reacts positively to that or corrects me saying that were just friends?

as a single mom working full time, in school, and with a couple of side hustles my days rarely consist of any relaxation lol. My days off work are full of running errands and trying to clean the house and then I doomscroll after my baby goes to bed as my ""me time."" today I decided to enjoy the day with my girl and did the bare minimum of work and it was awesome. 

Today, my LO woke up at 4am but I was able to put her back down after a bottle and she slept until 8am (latest I've gotten to sleep in since she was born!) then we spent a couple of hours playing with toys and watching Gilmore girls in bed (my comfort show rn). I Doordashed my favorite bagel and we shared some of that. Then we took a 3 hour contact nap and we both woke up in the best mood! Normally I would be so stressed that she napped that long but I decided not to think about it today. Went to my favorite coffee shop and then Costco for diapers and she waved at a stranger for the first time! Ate some leftover Friendsgiving food, gave her a bath, and put her to bed (which was relatively easy compared to how she normally is!) I put away all of our laundry, cleaned up a bit, packed our daycare/work bags, decorated my Christmas tree, drank a ton of water (something I've been horrible about lately), and did some minimal doomscrolling, and now i'm in bed before 12:30am :) 

I got a little behind on one of my side hustles, spent a little too much money, and the house isn't perfectly clean BUT I did enough to not feel stressed out and I don't have the looming guilt of not spending enough time with my baby on my day off.

10/10 day. I would kill to have this type of day everyday. Back to the grind tomorrow. My goal moving forward is to have one *mostly* lazy day a week and spend quality time with my girl.

Be ready with your popcorns and and your ICED coffee coz y'all are gonna be mad at me at some point during this story.

I, (29F) was engaged to my now ex-fianc√©, let's call him Asher (29M), in 2020. We were bestfriends up until we started dating in our second year of high school. We dated for only 3 days and I broke it off immediately as I was too scared of being in a relationship while trying to maintain my academic standings in school. (For context, we're asians and asian parents are a bit more strict especially when it comes to school). We stopped talking for a few months until we became bestfriends again. After him, I had been in a physically and mentally abusive relationships (2 abusers to be exact). Asher and I eventually rekindled our romance on my last year of college.
All of my friends were very happy for me as they said this has been the best relationship decision I have done so far. Well, they're in for a surprise. ü•¥

Asher and I had a smooth relationship for a year up until I had to take my licensure exam. A day before travelling to the exam center, I went over to his house and we were just hanging out, watching movies and all until his mom came over to us and asked him if he has told me yet. And he said no. I was so confused that time but Asher just brushed ot off. After an hour, his mom asked to talk to me alone inside his room. I remember feeling so scared and started overthinking like maybe l've done something wrong.

She started off by asking if I knew of this certain girl, let's call her Michelle. From what I knew, Michelle was an ""acquaintance"" of Asher from his training club. And I told her mom, yes I knew her. Her next sentence almost made me lose my head. She said Michelle just gave birth and reached out to them coz she was claiming Asher got her pregnant. I was at a loss for words. She said the baby was born with a medical condition that puts his life at risk. His mom said she wanted to let me know as Asher didn't have the guts to tell me but she emphasized that Asher STRONGLY DENIED being the father. She gave us the chance to talk and to sum things up, I believed him.

The next day, I was already on my way for my licensure exam (2-day intense exam), when I received a message just as I was about to enter the exam room. It was from Michelle. She was asking me to take pity on her child and to convince Asher to pay for child support since the child is currently fighting for his life at the hospital. I didn't get the chance to reply as I was already seated and the exam was about to start. The exam is an 8-5 exam with only lunch break allowed. I tried my best to get it out of my head as this exam was to make or break the entire course of my life. I managed to keep my cool until the end of the second day and I talked to Asher immediately about what Michelle told me. He said his parents already sent some money to her out of pity for the child but not because he admits he's the father. Which was kinda sus but whatever, it wasn't my money. I then responded to Michelle saying how sorry I was about her and her baby's situation and that l've tried talking to Asher but he's still denying it and I wouldn't get involved any further because I am just a girlfriend. I told her l'd pray for her and her baby. She still kept bothering me through messages but I didn't know what to say to her at that point. Sad thing was, the baby died a few days after that which totally broke my heart.

Fast forward after the Michelle drama, I passed the exam amidst the stress of it all. Asher and I were still together and he went back to college. (He started later than me because he got addicted to video games) Our whole relationship was a long distance one after that where we only get to talk to each other every weekend and see each other on christmas and new year because he's in a military school. And even after all the time constraints, he still managed to cheat on me. MULTIPLE TIMES. Too many to count on my fingers. And the funny thing is, I stayed. Yes I stayed. (I am probably a walking red flag myself because of this)

After 3 years into the relationship, I decided to move abroad for a job opportunity. I didn't think it would be much of a problem for us as we were already in a long distance relationship for quite awhile. And boy was I wrong about that. A month after moving abroad, I had a this feeling that I get whenever he's cheating on me. (Mind you, for all the times he's cheated on me prior, I would always catch him in the act. Like I probably would make a good FBI agent at this point). I couldn't shake it off. I shared my thoughts to the wife of his bestfriend (let's call here Eve) who I became friends with after we got together. She told me to look for more signs. Until one morning, as I was getting ready to go to work, Eve messaged me and before I opened her message I already had this feeling it wouldn't be a good news.

She said, she knew who he's cheating with and she sends me a photo of them in a mirror selfie to a place where we once went for vacation too. I was at a loss for words on who the girl was. She is the star of this story. Let's call her Megan.

Megan was the mistress of ASHER'S BESTFRIEND. Yes. Eve and I are flabbergasted. We had no idea that our partners were so close that they managed to screw one girl and make them their mistress. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Asher's bestfriend had her first and a year after that, Asher. I was furious and did something petty as that photo Eve showed me was posted on facebook. I commented and tagged Asher's mom and said this is what he was doing when he asked for your permission to go to his senior in military. Immediately after that, Asher started calling me nonstop and kept gaslighting me that I was crazy. I broke up with him after that. His whole family was consoling me but nothing eases the pain. What's worse, i learned about the affair a few weeks before taking another licensure exam for the country i moved to. I still fortunately passed the exam and stopped communicating with Asher way before i took it.

Fast forward to 7 months after that, Asher and I started talking again. He was apologizing until eventually we got back together (I am beyond stupid at this point ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). Our relationship was okay for another year but I could tell the damage was already there. He then proposed to me online, in a very public facebook post where he tagged me and our parents with a photo of a ring and mushy messages asking me to marry him as we were still in different countries. And I stupidly said yes. ü•¥

A few more months after that, I was already nearing the end of my contract in my workplace and planned to go home to my home country and have our wedding. We started wedding planning and all with the help of my besties who I knew were secretly questioning my sanity because of my decision to say yes to his proposal. He was also in another country due to the nature of his job and said we'd meet in our home country in a few months but his contract ends earlier than mine. Everything was great up until he arrived home. He started messaging less. And I started to get the ugly feeling again. Whenever i brought up the icky feeling he would gaslight me saying he's only been back for a few days and had just started hanging out with the dudes and i was just overthinking.

Well, my female instincts never failed me. I caught him cheating. AGAIN. And guess what? With MEGAN. AGAIN. Yes, it's her again. At that point I was already so fed up and so tired. I called off the engagement and blocked him on all social medias he could try to contact me with. Even email. I started going to therapy and hanging out with my friends and tried to make myself better until i reached the end of my contract.

A few weeks before my flight back home, I met this guy from our hometown (let's call him Mark) and we started talking to each other. He was nice and started making plans of what we'd do once I arrive home. Shortly after I finished my contract and flew back home, Mark and I were still talking and were very much interested with each other. I didn't get to see him until 10 days after my arrival as it was covid times and i had to undergo mandatory quarantine. Mark was a nice guy. He treated me far differently as how Asher did. We started dating. I was happy and stress-free. Or so I thought.

When I arrived at our hometown, I met with Mark and we started hanging out with my friends and we were all happy. One day, Mark started being shady about his whereabouts. I asked him if he wanted to hang out but he said he was sick and would rather stay home. I started to have the ugly feels again but i brushed it off thinking it was the trauma my past relationship gave me. And then, Me and my friend had plans to go out. I didn't have my own car yet so i used a public transport. When they tell you God has His favorites, I must be one of them coz as I stepped in, lo and behold, it was Megan. And boy was I not surprised when I heard she told the driver to drop her off at guess what? In front of Mark's house. ü§ê She tried to whisper it but girl I have good hearing and so after I heard that, I told her, ""Oh you're going to see Mark? Tell him to feel better soon"". 

Mark and I broke up after that. He was still trying to make amends and tried to make stupid excuses but i wasn't having it anymore. I told him to f*ck off. Next thing I heard was Megan and ""her friends"" were spreading rumors that I was the one who stole her man (Asher) that's why they broke up and that stealing Mark was her getting back at me. I was so speechless at this point I didn't even gave the rumor an ounce of my energy. I was a bit confident brushing off the rumors coz our whole hometown knew how long Asker and I have been together so nobody would believe all the sh*t she's been spewing around. Asher reached out to me saying he and Megan broke up coz she was screwing another guy (what a shocker üòÇ) who was apparently my boyfriend. I didn't reply.",3,1731915194.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

Tldr/ questions: how long is tea supposed to steep for?/ is 10-30 sec too short  (I cant remember the tea type and Im in bed right now) and how many times can you steep a tea bag?

If you're like me‚Äîpermanently running a little too warm, even in the middle of January‚Äîyou know the struggle of finding the **best comforter for hot sleepers**. Most options either feel like a sauna or so thin you might as well be using a paper towel. Enter the [EASELAND Cooling Comforter](https://amzn.to/4eurBTe).

I‚Äôve been using this for about six months, and let me tell you, it‚Äôs changed my life. First night under it, I woke up dry. DRY. As in, no weird middle-of-the-night peel-the-sheets-off-my-skin moment. My dog, who usually flees to the floor to escape my body heat, even stayed in bed! It was a win for both of us.

Here‚Äôs what makes it stand out:

1. **Light but cozy:** It‚Äôs not a sad, flimsy blanket‚Äîit feels substantial enough to be comforting but not suffocating.
2. **Temperature magic:** I don‚Äôt know what kind of wizardry EASELAND uses, but this thing somehow keeps me cool without making me cold. (And yes, I tested it in July during a heatwave when my AC decided to go on strike.)
3. **Machine washable:** A big deal when you spill iced coffee on it while binge-watching Netflix.

**BTW I GOT MINE FOR REALLLYYY CHEAP** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/4eurBTe)

For real-life context, I live in a 2nd-floor apartment with old windows that trap heat like it‚Äôs their job. This comforter keeps me comfortable through all of it. Even my partner, who‚Äôs basically a human furnace, stays cool. We used to fight over the thermostat; now we fight over who gets to burrito themselves in this thing.

If I had to nitpick, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not the most *aesthetically exciting* comforter‚Äîit‚Äôs more practical than Pinterest-worthy. But honestly, I‚Äôll trade the Instagram vibes for uninterrupted sleep any day.

So, if you‚Äôre hunting for the **best comforter for hot sleepers**, the[ EASELAND Cooling](https://amzn.to/4eurBTe) Comforter is worth it. It‚Äôs affordable, effective, and has saved me from melting into my mattress. Plus, my dog approves, and she‚Äôs pickier than I am.

Anywho. I want advice on how to mentally let go of all the bad stuff I‚Äôve been through with my mother in law. I‚Äôll include some 
1. The biggest one: because of her depression and what not she doesn‚Äôt leave the house ‚Äúlie‚Äù so I‚Äôve been married to him for over a year and I haven‚Äôt even seen her not once 
2. Lied about attending the wedding & had us instead of doing a destination wedding come do it in the US. with the hope she‚Äôll come. Never showed up. We ended up cancelling the whole damn thing 
3. She scares my FIL & SIL from ever meeting me. She‚Äôs abusive towards the whole family pretty much 
4. Talked about my honor, and tried to tell my husband that I wasn‚Äôt a virgin. Which I was. 
5. When FIL was in the hospital, she texted my husband saying that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre dying since the day she entered our life‚Äù 
6. We eloped & got married abroad without her & her psycho attitude. She did a smear campaign against my husband and I. To the entire family. 
7. My husband was thinking about purchasing a home together, she called him screaming not to

I could really keep going. Anywho. Recently 8 weeks ago or so. She had a whole attitude change. Sent me some designer bags???? But when I texted to thank her, she ignored my text. Very odd. Then she suggests to my husband that we should move in WITH THEM!! ahahaha omg. Anyway. My husband is trying to implement better boundaries. Goes over there once a week, on the weekend for a few hours. But that‚Äôs still insanely triggering for me. Because I remember how she‚Äôs made sure I‚Äôm excluded from the family. Hubby says she stopped saying anything bad about me. My FIL is nice but wouldn‚Äôt dare grab coffee with me or even see me. 

I had a massive crying session today about the future of this marriage. I love my husband so deeply. And he loves me too.  He married me against all of their wishes & the obstacles they put up. I don‚Äôt wanna have kids in such an environment. We‚Äôre waiting a few years anyway. But it scares me. I don‚Äôt wanna lose the man I love just because the family has repeatedly hurt me. I‚Äôm in therapy for this + we do couples counseling 

Side note: she‚Äôs on anti depressants & anti psychotics and such for over 20 years now. So I know she‚Äôs crazy. How do I build a wall so that I can just block her out of my life mentally & emotionally. 

Help please. I don‚Äôt wanna leave him but it‚Äôs been making me incredibly emotional & depressed lately. I‚Äôve put up with her bullshit behind my back for almost 2 years now. My husband tries all the time to shut her down and tell her you can‚Äôt talk like this about my wife. FINALLY it got through to her and she stopped in the last few months.

How do I rebuild trust?,"Basically we‚Äôve been having a rough few months. Lots of stress for both of us form work and financial pressure. I thought we were saving up to move but for a couple of months my gf would end up telling me she spent her half of the savings and had nothing. So this was making me really frustrated and sad, like feeling taken advantage of and misled etc, so I would say I had started to go abit cold maybe or just the tensions could be felt subconsciously 

Anyway, that‚Äôs the context. What happens next is what scared me the most. We had been have fights and I had been asking her like, given the above and all the stress, are we ok? Are you actually still happy in the relationship, have you been talking to someone else or something? I was confused why she would act likes this - basically saying one thing eg we‚Äôre planning to move, we‚Äôre happy and working toward the future etc, but then acting different, not actually saving anything, stressing at me, on her phone all the time etc

It turns out she had met twice with an old male friend who had been in town for a few days for work. He‚Äôd just got divorced. She had a day off work and met her girlfriend for lunch - she sent me a picture of her and her friend together at lunch whilst I was at work, to be like ‚Äúlook what a nice time we‚Äôre having‚Äù I was happy.  I want her to have friends and enjoy herself. What she didn‚Äôt tell me is that after that lunch she went to meet with this guy and went for coffee and showed him some shops.   

Then that weekend I had booked us cinema tickets to see a film together when she finished work on Sunday ( she works retail, I work 9 to 5 so we often don‚Äôt have weekend together anymore) she turned up pissed off about something and was angry at me immediately even though. 

Monday was her day off again. Turns out she wnet to meet the guy again for coffee and gave him a present and a card (some funny socks) I was at work 


Now the sad part is, how do I know this? Well I got really anxious a few weeks later after another fight and I looked at her phone when she was in the shower because I was thinking something is definitely wrong. Messed up I know but well there the messages were. Her saying how she has a day off and can meet, her saying did you like the card? Weird jokes about how he‚Äôs on dating apps now etc‚Ä¶
Like wtf? 

Personally I‚Äôm fine with my partner having friends. I have some female friends too, but it‚Äôs like, I‚Äôm not naive. I know male and female friendships always have a tension and some innocent flirting goes on, but secret meetings? Thats scary 

I asked her about it. We had a massive fight and alsmot broke up. I thought she had lied about who she was meeting and was really upset how she handled it. She said it‚Äôs my fault that I‚Äôm stressed and that‚Äôs why she couldn‚Äôt tell me because she knew I would react this way ( this has never happened before) 

We talked at length over the next few days and she was patient and answered all  questions. It‚Äôs just a friend from home, he lives in the USA now, he did try to date her when they were younger but she wasn‚Äôt interested, giving a small gift is just a cultural thing, she will talk to me more now, I will think about some trust issues etc


But still it‚Äôs on my mind like this was so close to cheating. Basically the only thing a that didn‚Äôt happen was anything physical, but it scared me because now I know that she can do something like that behind my back and I‚Äôm now not feeling secure or like really trust her tbh

This year, webneed to write a term paper. And because im really easy to sweettalk, i decided to write it about the Discworld and Terry Pratchett.
The Thesis would be : ""Terry Pratchett's view on organized religion as presented in Small Gods"".
Now, ive never heard about the discworld beforehand, but i thought it sounded cool.
I am already done with my mid-presentation, which is about the Discworld-Worldbuilding.
As i said, i find the discworld and its novels very cool, and the question i have for ya'll is:
Do you know about any essay about the Disc/Pratchett i could use for sources?

I already have Small Gods and the Guide, but i can't
find anything else that would be of any use. Like nothing.

If any of you could Help, that would be much appreciated.

Ps: Sorry for any typos etc, im not a native english speaker (Germany, and my paper will be in english) but the main reason may be me currently working on 2 Cigarettes and a coffee.

Tldr; Need sientific/serious sources about Pratchett

1gtz8nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/austinfood/comments/1gtz8nk/san_gin√©s_disaster/,San Gin√©s Disaster üá™üá∏üçøüá¶üá∑,"I preface my review by saying that I was thrilled San Gin√©s was opening their first location in Austin. I‚Äôm a Spanish citizen and have been to many San Gin√©s locations in Madrid. I love the brand, concept, and food! The opportunity to add another (authentic) Spanish place to El Raval and Kalimotxo in Austin was exciting. 

Now for the review‚Ä¶ even though I rooted hard for this restaurant, I went there today for an early evening bite and the place was a complete dumpster fire. It was a chaotic and terrible first experience. 

First the place: it seemed nice upon entering and even had a somewhat Spanish feel, but it was hard to navigate your way inside and outside the restaurant. The only way to order food was at two food trucks outside and you couldn‚Äôt tell which truck served what, or even where to place your order. The patio itself was nice, but was cluttered and the layout impeded the flow of traffic. I expected much more from the restaurant. 

Second: the drinks and food. We arrived at 6pm and the first thing we heard once we entered was a rude woman screaming ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not selling any more coffee, hot chocolate or drinks‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî at a Chocolater√≠a ü´†ü´†ü´† ‚Äî like what? And at a prime time hour. We also ordered churros and papas bravas. The churros were terrible. They were stale, oily, and had no flavor. The accompanying cup of chocolate was skimpy and not great either. Additionally, the papas bravas didn‚Äôt come out for 30+ minutes, and we just left. Utter disappointment. All of this said, you‚Äôd be better going to Starbucks, ordering a basic hot chocolate and dipping a butter croissant in it. Seriously. 

Third: the service. The woman screaming was a very bad first impression. Add to this that the two food trucks weren‚Äôt labeled (Tapas and Churros like they should have been) and the way the servers would deliver orders was super chaotic. There were at least 10 servers running around at all times using their phone flashlights to check customer orders. It was a fully chaotic and stressful experience. 

Fourth: the parking. I parked my car in the San Gin√©s lot and the way the lot is designed led me and others who parked in legitimate spaces to get blocked in. Markings and parking blocks were misleading and inappropriately placed, leading to confusion and guests leaving cars in places that were not in fact parking spaces. Because of that, myself and others were parked in and we had to wait 10 minutes to leave. The manager himself had to come out of the restaurant and ask people to rearrange their cars. He did not apologize and was arrogant, insisting that the issue was a lack of common sense among his clientele and not the obviously poor lot planning. Terrible, terrible customer experience. Incompetence from the design and management of San Gin√©s. They couldn‚Äôt plan ahead and see that parking was going to be an issue? 

I really hope that the San Gin√©s team reads this review (as well as others) and improves the experience. A complete rethink in strategy needs to take place! ",6,1731914003.0,austinfood,0,0.88,False
1gtz7j1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gtz7j1,Longest Run Sunday: My First Big Milestone,"Hey everyone! It‚Äôs been 2 months since I started running, and I‚Äôm finally chasing a goal I set for myself earlier this year: to complete a Half Marathon (HM). At first, I didn‚Äôt take it seriously. I did a 6 km fun run back in February, but had to walk the first 2 km because there were so many people. By the end, my hips and chest were screaming. Honestly, I thought to myself, ""Who actually enjoys running?""

I‚Äôve always been into gym workouts and casual football with friends, but running just didn‚Äôt seem like my thing. Fast forward to September ‚Äì I was talking to a friend about goals for 2024, and it hit me: I told myself I‚Äôd run a Half Marathon this year. Like many of us, I‚Äôd gotten addicted to the idea of setting big goals without actually committing to them. But that moment changed everything. I told my friend, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to run a Half Marathon before 2024 ends.‚Äù And I signed up for one in December.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve never run more than 4-5 km at a time in my life. So, I started training using Hal‚Äôs plan, focusing on gradually increasing my distance and stamina.

Yesterday, I ran my longest distance EVER without stopping. The pace wasn‚Äôt fast, and I was struggling ‚Äì my legs were heavy, my lungs were burning, but when I crossed that mental finish line, the feeling was indescribable. And a big, satisfying breakfast with coffee at a local cafe afterward made it all worth it!

To anyone who feels like they can‚Äôt do it or is struggling ‚Äì trust me, just KEEP SHOWING UP. You‚Äôll have days where it feels impossible, but the rewards are beyond worth it. Keep pushing, and you‚Äôll never regret it.

I used to stock up on them because my ex loved drinking Milo in the mornings. Whenever she stayed over, I‚Äôd make sure to get up before her, prepare her a glass, and wake her up with it. She didn‚Äôt eat breakfast, but a cold glass of Milo (not even warm‚Äîjust plain with cold water) always made her happy.

But we broke up. Because reasons. She won‚Äôt be staying over anymore, and now I‚Äôve got these sachets of Milo staring at me, along with an unopened bag of Lay‚Äôs BBQ chips we bought together but never ate.

The thing is, I don‚Äôt even drink Milo. It‚Äôs not part of my water-coffee-beer trifecta, and I‚Äôm not a chips person either. It‚Äôs kind of a familiar situation for me‚Äîhaving leftover food or snacks that I stocked up on for someone who‚Äôs no longer in my life. (Another ex loved Pocky Strawberry, Minute Maid Apple Juice, and Lotus Biscoff. We lived together, so I ended up with *boxes* of those things after we broke up, and it was a chore to finish them.)

It‚Äôs funny how these little remembrances can make moving on feel longer. I‚Äôm not the type to throw food away, even if it comes with some emotional baggage, but maybe I need to rethink how I stock up for people. Or maybe I need to learn how to be less of a biatch and make people stay.

Bowling, arcades, mini-golf, etc. It should be either a walking distance or a short drive from our first spot.

If you're looking to revamp your space with eco-friendly options that don‚Äôt compromise on aesthetics, here are some tips and ideas to create a greener home with a touch of elegance.

**Why Choose Sustainable Home Decor?**

Incorporating sustainable decor means making choices that are kind to the planet and your living space. From renewable materials to artisanal craftsmanship, eco-friendly home decor minimizes environmental impact while enhancing your home‚Äôs style. Whether you‚Äôre upgrading your living room or creating a serene bedroom sanctuary, sustainable pieces ensure you‚Äôre making a difference.

**Eco-Friendly Choices for Every Room**

**Living Room: Organic Textures and Timeless Accessories**

Ceramic Vases: Handcrafted [ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/ceramic-vases) are a timeless choice for sustainable decor. Made from natural materials, they bring elegance to any room while reducing the carbon footprint of synthetic alternatives. Use them to display fresh flowers or as standalone statement pieces on shelves or coffee tables.

Home Decor Accessories: Opt for items made from recycled or upcycled materials, like cushion covers crafted from repurposed fabrics or woven throws made from organic cotton. These not only look stylish but also tell a story of conscious design.

**Dining Room: Sustainable Dining in Style**

Choose reclaimed wood for dining tables and chairs to add rustic charm. Pair them with [home decor accessories](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration) like recycled glass candle holders or bamboo placemats for a cohesive, eco-friendly look.

Statement lighting can elevate your dining space. Look for pendant lights made from natural fibers such as rattan or jute for a warm, inviting ambiance.

**Bedroom: Create a Cozy Sanctuary**

Use sustainable textiles such as organic cotton or hemp for bedding and curtains. They‚Äôre breathable, durable, and free from harmful chemicals.

Add greenery with ceramic vases placed on nightstands or dressers, filled with dried flowers or small plants to purify the air.

**Bathroom: Minimalist and Natural**

Replace plastic bathroom accessories with bamboo or ceramic alternatives. Soap dispensers, toothbrush holders, and trays in natural materials add sophistication while being environmentally friendly.

Introduce elements like reclaimed wood shelving or recycled glass jars to store essentials stylishly.

**Outdoor Spaces: Eco-Conscious Retreat**

Furnish patios with weather-resistant pieces made from sustainable materials like teak or recycled metal.

Use pots and planters made from terracotta or ceramic to add natural charm to your outdoor greenery.

**Sustainable Home Decor in Dubai**

If you‚Äôre searching for [home decor Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) enthusiasts love, you‚Äôll find plenty of sustainable options that merge global trends with local craftsmanship. From handcrafted ceramic vases to eco-friendly home decor accessories, there‚Äôs no shortage of choices to create a stylish and environmentally conscious home.

Dubai‚Äôs growing emphasis on sustainability has led to an increase in stores offering ethical home decor products. Shopping for sustainable furniture and decor locally not only reduces carbon emissions but also supports artisans and small businesses.

**Tips for Embracing Sustainable Living**

1. Buy Less, Choose Wisely: Invest in high-quality, timeless pieces instead of mass-produced items.

2. Upcycle and Repurpose: Give old furniture or decor a new lease on life with a creative makeover.

3. Shop Local: Explore markets and stores that prioritize sustainability and eco-conscious practices.

**Final Thoughts**

Sustainable home decor is about making choices that reflect your values while enhancing your living space. From ceramic vases that add elegance to home decor accessories crafted from natural materials, every choice contributes to a greener planet. If you‚Äôre in home decor Dubai, explore the city‚Äôs offerings for sustainable and stylish designs to transform your home, one eco-friendly piece at a time.

TLDR: Please back us if you like the idea, we need your help to get this over the line!

We're not exactly off to a flying start, but I think (and hope) that's down to a few reasons:

1. We prioritized making sure we were going to deliver the product, and we also have an option which will deliver at the end of the campaign, and before christmas, which I thought was cool for a kickstarter. What this means is we've already invested in some of the smaller tools, so our advertising budget is pretty small! So, for example, we already have first samples of the parts for the lid and blades, and they're looking great (a few small cosmetic issues that will be fixed in production)

https://preview.redd.it/2q8ry602vl1e1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34ed56ca0d0cc6c8483f4354c5ba4e7349a0486c

2. We haven't given it to anyone for review. Seems like a big miss, but we only made 4 samples to test with our local community, in hindsight we'd have made a few more to send these out to all the learned folk who could put Iris through it's paces. We've added some units to the first CNC run and we'll be sending these out for testing. 

3. We haven't been teasing and seeding this for months. I now understand why this happens, building interest early and involving the community not only lets you build a pre-order list, but get's new and valuable feedback. We won't make this mistake again.

To that point, I got so many great comments from the community already, and I want you to know I've listened. These were my main takeaways:

1. You want to see science! And who doesn't?! Initially I thought most of the testing around shaking was out there, but I feel we have something to say on the subject now, and I'd like to do some work to be able to make some bold claims. Expect a separate post to pop up from me for input on designing my experiments!

2. You want magnets! Again, makes sense. I'm getting pricing for adding in magnets, they aren't necessary, but they're obviously a nice addition. BUT, it has to be said I probably need a few more orders before I feel comfortable we've got the demand to justify adding cost!

3. You care about retention. I can see how with the current style of blind shaker this could be a problem. Iris is different, since there is less surface area and no shelves for grounds to get stuck to, once the blades retract the walls are near vertical. This means that any persistent coffee grounds amount to a light dust, and shouldn't be anywhere near enough to register a difference in weight. Again, something I'll try and back up with numbers.

So, if you read all of that, thanks, please continue to give your thoughts and comments, and if you feel like you're interested in giving Iris a try, you know where to find it!

They had a deal with bank dhofar to provide pre-paid cards, but now they have launched their card system. Like a coffee, you can grab a bank card that can work like other cards. You can connect it to that thawing wallet. 

I add this card to all food delivery aggregators, online purchases, and basically everywhere. When I need to pay my Canva subscription bills, Google Pay subscriptions, or server payments, I just recharge this wallet from my bank Sohar or bank Muscat account.

Prepaid cards from the bank are expensive; this one is cheap and handy and available in all Omanoil stations/ Ahlain stores. ",1,1731912728.0,Oman,3,0.67,False

1gtyu42,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gtyu42/how_to_choose_furniture_that_matches_your/,How to Choose Furniture That Matches Your Lifestyle,"Your furniture is more than just functional‚Äîit reflects your lifestyle, preferences, and the way you interact with your living space. Whether you're furnishing a cozy apartment, a spacious home, or a vibrant outdoor area, the right pieces can make a world of difference. Here's how to choose furniture that perfectly aligns with your lifestyle.

**1. Understand Your Needs**

Start by evaluating how you use each space. Do you host frequent dinner parties, or do you prefer quiet evenings with a book? For an entertainer, a large dining table with comfortable chairs or versatile [stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools) can be ideal. If you‚Äôre all about relaxation, a plush sofa or ergonomic armchair may be your go-to.

Outdoor Enthusiasts: If your balcony is your sanctuary, opt for stylish and functional [balcony furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor). Think compact seating with weather-resistant materials to withstand the elements while adding charm to your outdoor retreat.

**2. Prioritize Functionality**

Multi-functional furniture is a game-changer, especially for small spaces. Look for dining tables that double as workspaces, or stools that can be tucked away easily when not in use.

Rattan Outdoor Furniture: This type of furniture combines elegance and durability, making it ideal for versatile outdoor settings. Use rattan chairs and tables to create a relaxed yet chic ambiance, whether it‚Äôs for al fresco dining or lounging by the garden.

**3. Align with Your Aesthetic**

Your furniture should match not only your lifestyle but also your personal taste. Do you gravitate toward minimalist designs, or do you prefer bohemian vibes with layered textures and earthy tones? 

Outdoor Spaces: If you love spending time outdoors, [rattan outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan) with cozy cushions can bring an inviting, natural feel to your patio or balcony. Pair with lush plants and ambient lighting to enhance the aesthetic.

**4. Consider Maintenance**

Choose materials that suit your maintenance preferences. Leather or synthetic upholstery may be better for families with kids, while upholstered furniture might appeal to those who love soft textures and comfort.

For outdoor spaces, prioritize low-maintenance options like rattan outdoor furniture, which is easy to clean and highly durable against weather changes.

**5. Adapt for Flexibility**

Furniture that adapts to your needs over time is essential. For example, stools can serve as extra seating when hosting guests or as side tables when you need a convenient spot to place your coffee.

**6. Think Long-Term**

Invest in timeless, high-quality pieces that will grow with your changing lifestyle. A well-made rattan outdoor furniture set or durable balcony furniture can be a cornerstone of your home for years.

**Key Takeaways**

Choosing furniture is about more than filling a space‚Äîit's about creating an environment that supports your daily habits and enhances your quality of life. Whether it‚Äôs stools for a flexible seating option, balcony furniture to optimize your outdoor space, or rattan outdoor furniture for a blend of style and durability, the right choices can transform your home into a sanctuary that reflects you.

I am a nerdy 40-year old Asian male, 5'7"", 210 lbs seeking a FWB, with an emphasis on the F. Big plus if you're into the student/teacher dynamic since this prof is looking for a naughty teacher's pet. What type of F would you like to be?

Friend--As I mentioned, I am nerdy homebody that enjoys puzzles, board games, card games like Magic The Gathering (been wanting to learn Pokemon TCG too, so maybe you can teach me), and even video games. I also consider myself a Foodie (another F), and enjoy trying out new restaurants, although it is quite expensive eating out in the Bay Area.

Fantasy/Foreplay--I am realizing that I have been sheltered (sexually) in my younger years and want to explore my kinkier side. Some kinks I would like to explore are CNC, exhibitionism, voyeurism, and teacher/student roleplay. Whether you are experienced or just exploring like me, I hope you are patient, so we can exploreand enjoy each other.

Fingering--Let's get you off by allowing me to Flick your bean, and then inserting one Finger, or maybe two Fingers, or my entire Fist if you're into that. I'd like to take my time with you and make sure you cum First, and if you're too exhausted from these series of F's, I'll keep myself edged for next time.

F*ucking/Fuck Buddy--Needless to say, this is the ultimate F. Missionary? Doggy? Cowgirl? Reverse cowgirl? Spooning? Who cares. Let's do what feels right and go with the flow--safe and protected, of course.

Maybe Fate brought you here. Unlikely, but maybe you'd like to turn that F grade into an A? There are many F's to choose from, so which one(s) will you choose?

Thank you if you've made it through my corniness. You may be wondering what I'm looking for, so here goes. First, Females (what, another F. Ok, I'll stop now) only between the ages of 18-60 (curious about age gap, younger or older). Big plus if you are college-aged or in college as I am a teacher who fantasizes about the teacher/student dynamic. I am also more attracted to petite, but please don't let that stop you from getting in touch.

Finally, to make sure you've actually read this essay, tell me your favorite F, and please put some effort in your response. I am hoping to meet soon, since I'd love to destress after a difficult and long semester, but I should mention that I will NOT be sharing pics to verify my identity. There have been too many scammers (or maybe just rude, immature ghosters) that just disappead after I send my pic.

Lower belly despite healthy diet and exercise","Hi, I (21F) weigh 114 lbs and measure 5'2 and I switched to a paleo diet combined with intermittent fasting 4 months ago after being sick of my lower belly for too long. I have had the exact same lower belly pooch since I was 13 years old. I have disliked myself and how my clothes fit every single day since. I am generally skinny everywhere else though (although my thighs could be smaller), and my belly from the front looks skinny but as soon as I turn to the side it is a different story.

Here is the best way I can describe my belly without an image: My belly has an indention horizontally making my stomach from the side almost look like the capital letter ""B"". With the upper half being flatter than the lower half. My lower belly from the side pokes out almost as much as my chest does.

Since I started my diet, I have also been doing exercise mostly through cardio but also common exercises like lunges, push-ups etc. When I do cardio, I have an incline and I usually do 30 minutes as 3mph steady walking. Recently, I tried to step it up and do 45 minutes, so I did that for 2 days straight. After the 2 days, the next morning I noticed a slight loss of belly fat, however, the nextday after that, it was right back to where I started. I am fine with doing 45 minutes of walking until the lower belly goes away completely, but what is the point if it will come right back despite me cutting out all sugar and processed foods?!?

The paleo diet consists of only organic whole food ingredients with meats like grass-fed beef, chicken and salmon. My fruits are mainly berries as well as bananas, apples, grapes, etc. My vegetable intake is mostly spinach leaves, microgreens and zucchini. The only liquids that I drink are water, black coffee, kefir, ACV and wheatgrass juice. Breakfast is usually 3 eggs for protein, some carrots (in the hopes that it will flush hormones), some fruit and kefir. Dinner is usually focused on meat with a homemade shake which is 3/4 spinach and the other 1/4 being berries, a little lemon juice and a little ginger.

I don't feel stressed out ever, I don't have a full-time job, I am an online college student that doesn't give their grades a thought. I never ""worry"" about things and I am a very calm person who doesn't get anxious over small things. It takes a whole lot to get me worried or angry. But there are so many hormonal belly videos saying that it could be high cortisol but I genuinely never feel stressed.

I get a full night's rest every single night, no interuptions. 8 hours always.

My intermittent fasting is from 10 AM to 5 PM, so that is my eating window. With the fasting, instead of 3 medium meals a day, I have 2 bigger meals a day now.

It isn't genetics because all of my sisters eat whatever and whenever they want, all hours of the night and don't gain a single ounce and are the skinniest people I know. For this reason, it is even more frustrating, because here I am trying to take care of my body by cutting out junk food and my sisters do whatever they want and still are skinny.

Maybe it could be hormonal? I don't know but I am just so frustrated and I just want to look like all of the girls that I see everywhere around me. I just want to wear nice clothes and not have to worry if my pooch roll is showing. So for the past few days, I have been sitting in the sun as soon as I wake up for 10-15 minutes in hopes that that will correct anything hormonal if that is the issue.

I have never worn perfumes or anything like that, I even stay away from endocrine disruptors like anything scented in the hopes that it will change something.",2,1731911014.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,0.75,False
