There are usually too many differing opinions on decision-making, I don't like sharing my space, and I prefer my own bed. Now, I'm planning a trip with three other girlfriends, and knowing the type of traveler I am, I decided to get my own room. I know I need alone time and a clean space—I'm too old to be on vacation and listen to someone snore, deal with the bathroom, or live with a mess. Plus, I wake up very early to read, have my coffee, and work out—these women do not operate that way.

The travel logistics are a bit more complex than usual: airport > 3-hour car ride > boat > arrival. We're just a few weeks away from the trip, and I've been the only one to do thorough research and provide options for us to agree on. They consistently ignore the information I've gathered and put off booking, but they do respond about outfits?! I made the executive decision to book the car for the first day (which they agreed to), but the return is still uncertain because they aren't offering input. I would have booked a round-trip, but I know they have a habit of missing flights. I've never missed a flight myself and consider myself responsible, especially since we've been discussing this trip for about six months. On top of that, two of the girls haven't even renewed their passports yet.

I'm starting to feel like pulling out and just going somewhere solo. I'm tired of having to follow up on basic arrangements for the trip. None of my bookings affect them since I have my own room and flight.

I wanted to post on here to hear other peoples experiences but also to document mine for people in this situation looking for other peoples experiences of coming off the pill. 

Just to preface as well I'm vegan (also 10 years), I take supplements of Omega 3, Quercetin Gummies (vitamin C, Zinc and Elderberry), Iron with vitamin D, Ginseng and Co-Q10 as well as get dopa supplements (its a lot i know but has helped me due to my adhd. As well as that i have lions mane in my coffee (half caf) everyday too. 

I exercise every morning but deffo need to more but i'm working towards that because i hate exercise lol 

On to the pill.. 

I stopped taking it two weeks ago and have had a withdrawal bleed last week. This week I have been very tired but also not been able to sleep as well as I usually can, its led to a few tension headaches.

Right now, I have a headache again and my muscles feel a little tense, i'm still able to get some work done luckily but I do feel not great. 

I will update this once I've had my first period, please do let me know all your experiences with coming off birth control below!

1) they always left me behind and walked without me. (Justification: maybe.. It's because I'm really short and I was wearing heels so couldn't walk as fast as them)

2) whenever we clicked pictures, they took one together always and when it's my turn, I have to ASK one of them to click it with me or else I'm clicking a picture with me. (Justification: honestly it's always me who goes like, 'hey let's click a picture' so maybe they're not interested in clicking a pic??)

3) at dinner table, the table behind us ordered black coffee. And I made a comment, 'dang who even buys black coffee it's literally overpriced coffee with water and bitter "" Cause I hated bitter stuff but I was obviously joking. They literally started attacking me after this with one comment after other. (Justification: idk maybe they didn't get the joke?..)

4) I had to leave early. And none of them even walked with me. They just kept talking to each other. (Justification: they said bye. So ig they weren't supposed to walk with me towards the exit?)

5) also at dinner, they kept talking about sports which they know I'm not interested in and don't know much. (Justification: they also talked about other stuff but not thay much.. Idk)

6) somehow, if there are different opinions among the group, I'm always the odd one. (Justification: idk. Maybe my opinions happen to be different?)

I’m living in one of the busiest cities in Asia, working a corporate job that is very stressful and 10 more weeks until my maternity leave. My husband and I own our house, fully paid. We are minimalists so our expenses are quite low. He earns 75%, I earn 25% of our combined income. Monthly expenses are around 15-20% of total income, the rest are saved and invested. We got a piece of land in the countryside that we plan on building a house then permanently move there in the next 3-5 years as it’s our dream to live a simple quiet life surrounded by nature.

I will have 6 months of paid maternity leave, then I’ll need to decide whether going back to work or become a stay at home mom. Actually SAHM is our only choice at the moment as we don’t have family support, my husband works from home but has long hours, and I have to work from office with 1.5hr commute daily. We don’t want our child to go to daycare that early.

I always know corporate is not my cup of tea, and I want to explore baking (casual home baker, I also cook a lot) and running a coffee shop. But I’ve been working so hard to get the credentials and climb up the corporate ladder that it scares me so much to get out of it. So many things can go wrong, especially with what happened to my brother (he quit his banking job, ran a start-up with a friend and got fraud and now under a huge debt that my parents have to help him for the past 3 years).

I know I’m different from my brother. We have enough cash for the next 5 years if we both don’t work. We live below our means, no debt, and will pay for the new house in cash. we don’t even have credit cards. Yet I’m still so scared of not earning a relatively stable monthly income, just in case something happens so my husband’s job.

We are going to have a baby soon, and I’m in another dilemma. I want my child to have a childhood with plenty of time for fun and nature (hence countryside). Yet at the same time I’m afraid if my child doesn’t study hard like those in the cities, they will struggle later in life. Still, I don’t want my child to study too much, Asian education system is crazy, so many kids are anxious and depressed and hate their lives, I am the prime example of that. I used to study from 6am until 12am, daily. I have lived my life thinking my worth is how others perceive me - my grades, my job, how much money I earn, and I have been suffering so much because of it.

Our plan is to move for a few years, and if things go south we can always go back to the city - we will keep the house here for rent. I do think we have everything figured out, the only thing that is in the way is my anxiety. The default path (the rat race) is so well embedded in my mind that it is safe (actually not that safe and stable anymore in this economy) that I just keep coming back to the decision again and again.

1jhbiuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1jhbiuw/jack_barrington_a_renobased_audio_mixer_making/,"Jack Barrington, A Reno-Based Audio Mixer Making Bands Sound Just Right","Jack, a local audio engineer and owner of *Mixed By Jack*, holds a custom-engraved microphone he uses to record both touring and local clients. This microphone has become a signature tool in capturing the sounds of the artists he works with.

Jack Barrington’s passion for mixing audio began at a young age, driven by a fascination with how sound shapes experiences. He recently achieved his dream of opening his own mixing business, producing music for local and touring bands.

At just 15 years old, he started experimenting with audio production on GarageBand, spending hours perfecting every bit of sound. This early hobby sparked a deep interest in audio production, pushing Jack to explore the technical side of mixing and editing.

During high school, Jack’s skills progressed significantly. While attending Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, he was given the opportunity to create the official news intro song for the school’s daily newscast. 

Now in his senior year of college at the University of Nevada, Jack has turned his passion into a budding business. As a local audio engineer and owner of a company called *Mixed By Jack*, he specializes in recording both live and studio sounds for Reno's emerging local band scene. 

In above photo, Jack listens intently as he fine-tunes the backing tracks for local band FKA Fingers, recorded live during their Halloween show on October 28th at Midnight Coffee Roasting. Since he’s mastering the recording for a CD release, streaming loudness normalization isn’t a concern. This gives him the freedom to push the loudness beyond Spotify’s standard -14 LUFS, achieving a richer and more impactful sound.

Dedicated to supporting new and upcoming talent, Jack works closely with artists to capture their unique sound, blending technical precision with creative artistry.

Lately he’s been experimenting with his brand-new Fairchild Compressor plug-in. This powerful tool reduces the dynamic range by compressing loud signals and enhancing quieter ones, resulting in a more balanced, warm, and polished final mix.

 His SSL console helps him combine multiple audio signals into a cohesive stereo or surround mix. Each channel strip allows precise control over volume, panning, EQ, dynamics, and routing.

For now, Jack keeps his operations grounded, editing tracks in his cramped bedroom in a shared apartment located in East Reno, carefully storing all his equipment in a modest closet setup. His journey from experimenting on GarageBand to producing live recordings for local bands reflects his determination, resourcefulness, and commitment to honing his craft.

Kim Soohyun's fault was to date her when she was minor and indeed that's criminally wrong but her family too didn't take action that time.
Some rumours say that he forced her to take loan.

This is just getting messier and messier. My views about him are completely changed but if he is one of the reasons why Kim Saeron had this huge debt then Karma will itself pay him.
But do you really think he is one of the reasons for her death?

Saw another post where they dragged Choi Hyunwook regarding his posts about Kim Saeron showing gratitude to her for sending coffee truck.
I just feel like either they are trying to save Kim Soohyun by making rookie actors the scapegoat or Knetizens are just finding another victim to bully.

1jhbbog,https://odysee.com/@ProgressiveTruthSeekers:3/Autism-and-Vaccines:e,THIS Is What SILENCED Robert De Niro Over Autism and Vaccines,"In 2016, Robert De Niro says he regrets pulling the film linking the MMR vaccine to autism after his son changed 'overnight' following his son's vaccination.

The veteran actor and founder of the Tribeca Film Festival came under fire after announcing he would screen Vaxxed: From Cover-up To Catastrophe. He reversed his decision.

The 72-year-old said, at that time, he made the decision as he did not want the backlash to affect the film festival but insisted that 'the movie is something that people should see.'

'All I wanted is for the movie to be seen and people can make up their own judgment but you must see it,' he said.

'Let's find out the truth, let's just find out the truth.'

De Niro, who has an 18-year-old Elliot son with autism, said he had hoped that screening the film could have started a 'discussion' about the link between the vaccine and autism.

It is connected via the MDB cable, and everything seems to be working fine. However, for some payments, after tapping the card or device, a green checkmark appears with the message ""Payment Accepted,"" but immediately after, a cross appears, and the payment is declined.

At first, I thought this issue only occurred with digital payments (phone, smartwatch, etc.), because my physical card worked without problems. But according to customers, some experience the opposite issue—payments work on their phone, but not with their physical card.

This issue happens randomly, without any clear pattern. I have no idea what to do. Nayax support told me that the terminal is fine, while the coffee machine supplier told me the issue is with the terminal.

Has anyone else encountered this problem? We already ran diagnostics with Nayax, updated the firmware, and tried ignoring the message during product dispensing, but nothing has helped.  
Sometimes payment works on 2nd or third time.

1jhbay1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestationSecrets/comments/1jhbay1/positive_manifestation_techniques_for_increased/,Positive Manifestation Techniques for Increased Productivity,"I've often wondered whether our thoughts truly shape our reality when it comes to productivity. Through years of research and personal experience, I've discovered that **positive manifestation** isn't just wishful thinking - it's a practical approach backed by **cognitive science** and **behavioral psychology**. If you're struggling to reach your full potential, the techniques I'm about to share have helped countless professionals transform their work habits and achieve breakthrough results.

# Harnessing the Power of Daily Affirmations

While many dismiss affirmations as mere wishful thinking, these powerful statements can fundamentally reshape our mindset and behaviors when practiced consistently.

Through **affirmation journaling** and positive self-talk, you'll gradually shift from negative thought patterns to solution-oriented thinking that serves your goals. Additionally, regular journaling can [enhance self-awareness](https://paulvangelder.com/discover-50-inspiring-journal-prompts-for-self-growth/), allowing you to better understand your motivations and desires.

>Daily affirmations and self-talk transform negative mindsets into empowering thoughts that align with your vision and propel you forward.

I've found that combining multiple techniques amplifies the impact. Create a **vision board** with inspiring images and statements that resonate with your aspirations.

Complement this with **guided meditation recordings** to reinforce your daily practice. As you embrace these tools, you'll notice **increased confidence** in your professional abilities and reduced stress levels when facing workplace challenges.

The key is replacing **unproductive habits** with intentional behaviors that align with your vision of freedom and success. Regular practice helps [cultivate positive thinking](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/affirmations-for-productivity) that naturally reduces anxiety and stress in the workplace.

Your mind will naturally gravitate toward solutions rather than dwelling on obstacles.

# Visualizing Success Through Immersive Techniques

Because visualization gains power through engaging multiple senses, I recommend creating an **immersive experience** that transports you into your desired reality.

Through **sensory details** and immersive imagery, you'll break free from **limiting beliefs** and step into your highest potential. Regular practice of [mental rehearsal exercises](https://www.corexta.com/visualization-techniques/) builds your confidence and reduces anxiety before important events. Additionally, [self-reflection and introspection](https://paulvangelder.com/how-do-i-start-self-growth/) can enhance your visualization by helping you align your visualizations with your core values and beliefs. Let's **amplify your manifestation practice** by engaging all five senses:

* Feel the texture of your success - whether it's the smooth leather of a new office chair or the weight of an achievement medal
* Hear the sounds of your accomplishment - applause, congratulations, or the hum of your dream car
* Smell the distinct aromas tied to your vision - fresh coffee in your corner office or ocean breeze at your beach house
* Taste the flavors of celebration - champagne bubbles or victory dinner
* See yourself vividly living your **ideal life** \- **confident posture**, radiant smile, accomplished presence

# Setting Clear Intentions for Goal Achievement

Positive\_Manifestation\_Techniques\_for\_Increased\_Productivity\_0001.jpg

Since manifestation requires purposeful direction, setting **clear intentions** serves as your roadmap to achieving your goals.

I've found that intention clarity emerges when you structure your desires using the ""if-then"" framework, making your path forward crystal clear and actionable. This structured approach can enhance your [personal development plan](https://paulvangelder.com/setting-personal-development-goals-for-success/) by clearly outlining your strategies for success.

To release your potential, break down your goals into **micro-actions** that align with your deepest values.

When you pair **goal specificity** with environmental cues, you'll find yourself naturally flowing toward your desired outcomes.

Research shows that [cognitive mechanisms](https://leantime.io/how-to-use-implementation-intentions-to-reach-your-goals/) significantly boost goal achievement through enhanced cue accessibility.

I recommend creating **implementation plans** that anticipate obstacles - this way, you're ready for any challenge that comes your way.

Remember to integrate your intentions into **daily routines** through simple, consistent actions.

# Cultivating Gratitude for Enhanced Focus

The **profound link** between gratitude and focused manifestation stems from powerful neurobiological shifts in our brain. When I practice regular **gratitude exercises**, my medial prefrontal cortex activates, enhancing my **decision-making abilities** and concentration. Research shows that [four weeks later](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_gratitude_changes_you_and_your_brain), practitioners begin experiencing noticeable mental health improvements. Engaging in [mindfulness techniques](https://paulvangelder.com/boost-your-growth-self-development-activities/) can further support this process by deepening self-awareness and reducing stress.

I've discovered that combining appreciation rituals with visualization amplifies my **manifestation power** exponentially.

* Start each morning writing three things I'm grateful for
* Take mindful breaks to appreciate my immediate surroundings
* Express verbal gratitude to strengthen relationships and personal power
* Practice future gratitude by thanking the universe in advance
* Reframe challenges by finding **hidden blessings** within them

# Aligning Mindset With Productivity Goals

Mastering **productivity goals** requires a mindset deliberately aligned with your deepest aspirations.

I've found that true productivity alignment begins with integrating **SMART principles** while maintaining flexibility in your approach. Start by visualizing your success daily and creating **vision boards** that reflect your professional dreams - these mindset shifts will help embed your goals into your subconscious. Engaging in [mindful goal setting](https://paulvangelder.com/real-life-personal-development-activities-you-can-try/) fosters a deeper understanding of personal growth and keeps your focus on what truly matters.

Research shows that [self-assessment practices](https://www.jointhecollective.com/article/aligning-personal-and-professional-goals-for-leadership-success/) through journaling can significantly enhance your ability to articulate and achieve goals. I recommend seeking **mentor feedback** regularly to identify where your mindset might be misaligned with your objectives. Break down your larger goals into manageable chunks, and practice **daily gratitude** to stay connected with your purpose.

Through consistent self-assessment and **positive affirmations**, you'll develop an unshakeable mindset that naturally flows with your productivity goals. Remember, it's not just about working harder - it's about aligning your inner world with your outer achievements.",1,1742658154.0,ManifestationSecrets,0,1.0,False

I trust the medical advice I've received, I'm just concerned that the “wait and see” approach takes time whilst the symptoms don't improve. I don’t want to discover later that it was something more serious so just keen to ensure I'm continuing to ""act"".

36M.

My primary symptom is a constant discomfort in the LUQ. Initially, it felt like I’d swallowed a tennis ball and it would come and go. Over the last few months, it’s been constant, usually around a 2/10 on the pain scale, but frequently it flares up. Sitting can become uncomfortable, and it always feels as if something is “stuck” or ""blocked"" there, but there are no functional issues that agree with that. Just as a sensation. I once thought certain foods or drinks (like milk or coffee) made it worse, but now I’m not sure it ever fully goes away regardless. It is very uncomfortable and I really mean constant. I have to sleep in certain positions, it hurts when I'm sitting etc.

It recently has developed into dyspepsia and I have trouble burping unless I move around to force it.

I’ve had multiple blood tests. Overall, they’ve all been within normal ranges, but I’m on the low end of normal for folate and ferritin, with a high B12, a white blood cell count that’s 0.1 below normal, and a mildly elevated IgA. I purely put this for any context, as more than one doctor agreed that these levels, in context, weren’t alarming. The B12 score has been consistent in older blood tests. Appear I always have had a high B12.

I have maintained my weight, and lost no more than 1 or 2 pounds throughout.

At a recent appointment, my doctor did a thorough physical exam and found nothing palpable in my LUQ, although I did wince slightly when she pressed on the area where the esophagus meets the stomach. I don’t notice pain there day-to-day. Otherwise, everything else seemed normal. We did discover a small, tender lymph node in my groin (about half a centimeter), but I can’t even find it myself. The doctor noted it could be related, or it could just be noticeable because I’m on the thinner side. No other abnormal lymph nodes were detected.

The plan was to try a different PPI for four week (this previously had no effect) then possibly get an ultrasound before seeking a gastroenterologist referral. I’ve been on the new PPI for about a week, and while my dyspepsia seemed to improve at first, it has flared up again. Though the fact it did anything is different to previous PPI use, so that's something. The LUQ discomfort remains unchanged.

Unfortunately, the hospital disagreed with my PCP and said the ultrasound was not required here. I understand there’s a rationale for that, and I'm not a doctor. Would it be worth pursuing that privately to at least just have it done? I don't know why it's not required.

Also any ideas on anything to try in relief or even to help them diagnose? I think my overall feeling is that I understand it's a diagnostic process, but at some points it has been a ""see if it gets worse in X time"" but I'm not actively doing anything to try and reduce or improve symptoms - which never go away.

I continue with the doctor, just any advice or views - really welcome. Struggling with it. Thanks.",1,1742657901.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

My husband and I argue a lot and about everything. He pays for everything and I am a sahm to our 16month old, if you were to ask me what my issues are it’s that he doesn’t care to spend time with me or do things as a family, he doesn’t do anything at all for me, not make me a coffee, not even remember my favorite flower, not considerate at all, everyone we argue he is just so dirty and disrespectful with his mouth, he’s said things like “get out of my* house I pay for everything so it’s mine” he has taken gifts and locked then in his safe saying they’re his since he paid for them, he will ignore my phone calls, won’t try to communicate unless I force it and even then it turns into an argument and he wants to to apologize and say everything is my fault, I’m not joking when I say this man has not done something genuine or kind for me in forever (he thinks cleaning up dinner with me is doing me the biggest favor on earth when it’s the only thing he does)
I do all the house cleaning, I have to ask him to bring clothes to the laundry room multiple times to get him to do it, I actually have to nag multiple times to get him to do anything I need, forget about a want. 
I do all of his laundry, do everything for the baby, clean the whole house, he’ll make dinner maybe twice a month but don’t clean up after himself ever* when he is with the baby he is such a good father, he loves her so much but he doesn’t check to see if she puts something dangerous in her mouth and he doesn’t really engage in playing or reading to her, he’ll watch tv while she’s around him playing. 
If you ask him about me, I’m completely ungrateful and selfish for what I think is not bending over backwards and kissing his feet bc he pays for everything, he always brings up that he works and pays for everything when we argue because that is all he does, he doesn’t plan dates and the last two dates we had for Valentine’s Day and our wedding anniversary got canceled since our girl was sick both times but he never thought about reschedule or making up for it and I mentioned it and his excuse was “I made reservations so you can’t say I didn’t make an effort” yeah but they fell through so why not reschedule for the week after?
I have never taken something away or even threw gifts in his face that I got him, I’m never nasty with my mouth I dont call him anything worse than an asshole, he has called me every name in the book

He’s always saying “this is who I am” but it wasn’t when I met him. 
I have become very short with him and not as lovey but I can’t help it, who wants to fake being so lovey to someone who doesn’t even ask them how their day was? Someone who constantly says “I can’t do xyz or take care of baby I have to go in the basement and work” when he just came home from work… I don’t think he’s cheating he just literally doesn’t want to help at all, he doesn’t feel like he should be doing anything at home except being treated like a king
I have to beg him to stay in the same room as me when I’m cleaning up or doing something just so I don’t feel alone and he maybe does it 20% of the time? 

Truly I just feel like he hates me, when we met he was head over heels a dream man! And I’ve always been with him and my past relationships a lover girl, I’ve always been so thoughtful and have never missed a holiday to buy gifts (which he makes it very obvious he doesn’t like some of my gifts and he doesn’t even thank me half the time and I call him out on it often) he didn’t get me anything for vday or our anniversary bc he bought me a very expensive Christmas gift so we agreed it would roll over but I honestly expected something super small, like a pajama set or anything just to show appreciation but he thinks I don’t do anything for him, he doesn’t see my effort he doesn’t see anything, he thinks bc he works the baby the house should ALL be my job, every single bit of it
He’s become this insanely mean disrespectful person I would have never married and I hate that our relationship is like this. 

When he’s good he is SO good but I do feel as if he is never there even if he is physically there

I replaced the motor with this one (I think it's from Philips).

Since replacing the motor, I have thoroughly cleaned and lubricated the brew group and replaced the gaskets on the main plunger on the brew group and boiler pin. I also did the steam-out program to try and reset things. I don't think it's the grind settings since it seems like the machine just isn't dosing enough grinds to make a puck.

Since replacing the motor, I have been unable to make coffee or espresso. When I attempt to make a drink, the machine seems to sound like it's supposed to, but the result is incredibly watery coffee and ground coffee soup in the dump box. I'm tired, uncaffinated, and I need help.

1jhb2n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/1jhb2n3/looking_for_bathroom_recommendations_along_the/,Looking for bathroom recommendations along the peninsula.,"I commute from San Francisco to the South Bay pretty much every day.  I usually take 280 south to 380 and then cross over to take 101 down to about the 237 interchange in Sunnyvale.  Yeah it’s a long drive.  I happily pay the toll to use the express lane when events warrant.  

I also am in recovery from surgery for colorectal cancer.  As a result, my digestive tract is now shorter and holds less.  So I now poop a lot.  Sometimes 15 times a day.  A good day for me is only 5-7 times.  And the urge to poop can go from 0 to 60 really fast.  Mornings are typically very busy for me.  I’ll wake up poop brush my teeth poop do some morning stretches poop shower poop etc etc.  Maybe a few more poops mixed in there.

So you can imagine that successfully making the drive from SF down to the South Bay in the morning rush can be quite an adventure.  And let me say that s***ting yourself on the way to work is not as fun and edgy as it might seem.  So I’ve learned many of the signs my body is telling me about whether it thinks I’ve got a poop-free hour ahead of me in order to make it to work stress- and mess-free.  My work is fortunately flexible enough that I can shift schedule and wait to drive down until I’m feeling a bit more confident, or else work from home when I need to.  But I don’t always judge things correctly and then find myself in a pickle somewhere along the peninsula.

So I’ve had to divert for bathroom emergencies on several occasions.  Up north I’ve found the Target at Serramonte is conveniently right off of 280 and is open and not crowded during the morning commute.  It has multiple stalls in a restroom right near the entrance and I don’t feel like I’m intruding when I rush in.  I’ve also rushed to the Philz Coffee at the Westborough exit in San Bruno.  But their bathroom is a single stall so there’s a risk it’s occupied.  And the place is small so I feel a bit conspicuous and guilty for using their facilities without buying something.

But once I cross over to 101, I don’t really know where to go.  And so I’ve come here looking for recommendations.  Preferably it’s adjacent to a southbound 101 freeway exit, between 380 and 237.  And it has plenty of parking and will be open in the morning hours.  Ideally it’s not just a single stall so there’s no queue and is kept in good shape.  Hopefully I can just blend in with the crowd and not feel the glare of suspicious eyes when I rush in off the street and make a beeline to drop a deuce.

1jhb1yz,https://v.redd.it/k9oxl8hef9qe1,How can practicing gratitude reshape your outlook on work & life?,"Practicing gratitude can rewire your brain, boost productivity, and improve leadership. Discover science-backed benefits of gratitude in work and life—with tips to make it a daily habit.

Gratitude: it’s not just for Thanksgiving dinners and motivational mugs. It’s a scientifically-backed, career-elevating, stress-reducing powerhouse that transforms your mindset and performance in powerful ways. Whether you're leading a team, launching a business, or surviving your inbox, practicing gratitude can shift your reality from “just getting by” to thriving with intention.

Let’s explore how gratitude reshapes your brain, your work, and your life—without requiring a Himalayan retreat or a gratitude crystal (though hey, no judgment if that’s your vibe).

1. Gratitude Reprograms Your Mind
Keywords: gratitude and mental health, benefits of gratitude
Gratitude triggers dopamine and serotonin, the “feel-good” chemicals that make positivity a natural state—not something you fake for Zoom meetings.

Boosts Positivity: Strengthens mental pathways to focus on opportunities, not obstacles.
Builds Resilience: Reduces cortisol (the stress hormone), helping you bounce back faster from setbacks.

Quick Tip: Start your day by noting two things you’re grateful for. Coffee counts. So does waking up on time without snoozing six alarms.
 

2. Amplifies Productivity and Engagement
Keywords: gratitude at work, employee engagement
Gratitude isn’t just good vibes—it’s good business.

Enhances Performance: Employees who feel appreciated are 50% more productive.
Improves Team Dynamics: Grateful teams collaborate better and feel more invested.

Real Example: Outdoor giant Patagonia fosters a culture of appreciation, leading to low turnover and high morale. Turns out, thankfulness is better than turnover charts.
 

3. Elevates Leadership and Connection
Keywords: gratitude and leadership, emotional intelligence
Gratitude doesn’t just make you likeable—it makes you effective.

Cultivates Trust: Leaders who express real appreciation build loyal, high-performing teams.
Boosts Emotional Intelligence: Regular gratitude makes leaders more empathetic and respected.

Leadership Insight: At Adobe, leaders openly express gratitude, which increases retention and performance. No trust falls required.
 

4. Reduces Stress and Burnout
Keywords: gratitude and stress relief, workplace wellness
Gratitude helps shift your mindset from obligation to appreciation.

Improves Recovery: Viewing challenges through a gratitude lens speeds up emotional recovery.
Lowers Stress: Regular gratitude practice can reduce stress hormones by 23%.

Practice Prompt: At the end of the day, reflect on a tough moment and ask, “What’s one good thing that came from this?” If your coffee didn’t spill during chaos, that counts.
 

5. Helps Navigate Failures Effectively
Keywords: growth mindset and gratitude, gratitude for challenges
Gratitude turns failures into lessons instead of losses.

Fosters Growth Mindset: Reframes failure as feedback, not defeat.
Sustains Confidence: Grateful people recover quicker, with their optimism intact.

Case in Point: Author Stephen King kept every rejection letter, grateful for the progress. Imagine turning rejection into décor—now that’s perspective.
 

6. Turn Gratitude into a Habit
Keywords: daily gratitude habits, how to practice gratitude
Gratitude is powerful—but only if you practice consistently.

Gratitude Journal: Note daily wins, big or small.
Immediate Thanks: Don’t delay—acknowledge effort as it happens.
Reframing: Ask, “What can I learn or appreciate here?”

Example: Media mogul Arianna Huffington credits nightly gratitude reflections for her clarity and resilience. You could too—without the empire (for now).
 

Final Thought: Gratitude Is Your Daily Multiplier
Gratitude multiplies everything you want: positivity, productivity, resilience, and better relationships. One small act of thanks today can set the tone for your week, your work, and your well-being.

Challenge:
Identify one overlooked thing today that deserves your appreciation. No need for grand gestures—sometimes the Wi-Fi not cutting out during a meeting is a small miracle worth celebrating.

Want to ask better questions—and get better answers—in every area of life? Follow Question-a-Day to boost your curiosity, creativity, and conversation game. 

Bookmarked for You: 

Because sometimes, the answers actually are in the back of the book — or at least in one of these three.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jhazst,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1jhazst/why_do_people_overexaggerate_how_cheap_chicago_is/,Why Do People Overexaggerate How Cheap Chicago Is?,"I'm from DC and moved to Chicago for grad school. People over exaggerate how affordable Chicago is and are in denial about how it's continuously getting more expensive. Every time there is a headline about how inflation is bad in the city or someone posts about how expensive rent is getting, way too many people defend the city and say ""it's not NYC prices."" To put it as nicely as possible, the prices in Chicago aren't as high as the prices in NYC because amenities in Chicago such as transit, food, accessibility, cultural attractions, transit, economy, incomes, and racial integration don't compare to that of NYC. It's a no brainer that Chicago is cheaper than NYC. And before people come here saying I'm only talking about Lincoln Park, River North, Lake View, Gold Coast, and Wicker Park, I'm not.

Nobody ever calls DC an ""affordable"" city even though rental prices in Chicago and DC are pretty comparable at this point in neighborhoods that are similar to each other. And unlike in Chicago, people in DC actually have the incomes to support those rental prices.

[You can get numerous brand new studios and even 1 beds in DC for $1.8k a month in neighborhoods like NoMa, Navy Yard, and the Wharf](https://www.apartments.com/washington-dc/max-1-bedrooms-under-1850/washer-dryer/). All of them have in unit washer and dryers as well, which is considered a ""luxury"" in Chicago, and many are advertising 2 months free. [When you search for apartments for rent in DC with in unit washer and dryer for less than $1.85k a month in DC, you get over 1,000 results. When you do the same on Chicago,  you get less than 800 results](https://www.apartments.com/chicago-il/max-1-bedrooms-under-1850/washer-dryer/) even though Chicago is a much larger city than DC. 

In Chicago, neighborhoods that are comparable to NoMa, Navy Yard, and The Wharf in DC like West Loop, South Loop, and Fulton Market, newer units are going for $2,500 to $2,900, and they often won't let you park in their $400 a month parking garage if you're ""only"" renting a studio or ""only"" paying $2,300 a month in rent. I toured a building in West Loop called the Elizabeth which is literally next to absolutely nothing but abandoned lots and crumbling buildings with graffiti on them, and they were asking for $2.2k a month for a tiny studio and $3k a month for a 1 bed, $400 a month in parking (which you couldn't park in with only a studio). This seems common throughout the whole neighborhood. 

It's not just in neighborhoods around the loop that are popular or trendy either. I'm a graduate student and live in Hyde Park (which is supposed to be more affordable), and rental options are really bad here as well. Your life depends on mac or ivy, both of which blatantly price gauge UChicago students and severely overprice their units. Roach infested and old buildings with no in unit laundry like Regents Park are being advertised as ""luxury"" and ask for $1.7k to $1.9k a month for a studio--the same price as new apartments with all the bells and whistles in popular new neighborhoods in DC. The studio I'm renting in HP for $2.1k a month was only $1.4k a month 5 years ago. The actual new apartments like 5252 and Solstice are all $3k a month for a one bedroom, and even $1.5k a month limits you to ivy buildings that have no dishwasher, roach infestations, and numerous reviews of people saying their roofs caved in.  

People are in massive denial about how outrageously expensive this city is becoming for renters, and it's extremely frustrating. The other day, I just read an article about how even UIC students with full ride scholarships had to take out $$$ in students loans to support the cost of living in West Loop over 4 years.  

Chicago is arrogantly overpriced. From the rents, to the street parking, to the taxes, to the numerous mid coffee shops with pastries they bought from Costco charging $20 for a muffin and a coffee. And people who think that a bunch of Google and consulting bros are going to hand over their money are in denial and need a reality. The incomes and white collar industry in Chicago are not anywhere near as high/expansive enough to support the COL, and vacancies in these apartment buildings asking for $2.8k a month are high. 

Stop gaslighting people into thinking that it's not actually bad and that they're the problem because they didn't consider looking for an apartment in Englewood or all the way deep in the South Side with the Indiana border. 

This is not meant to be a diss on Chicago. Chicago is a large world class city with some of the best ethnic food in the whole country and great people, but I'm just sick of people acting like the current trend of pricing in Chicago is okay and normal when it's outrageous.

These two squads played each other just recently and barely cracked 200 points. Now to be fair, Tyrese Haliburton sat that last game out due to a back injury – and he remains ‘Questionable’ for this evening. In any case, I imagine they’ll be trying to limit his minutes if he does suit up. To boot, the last 3 straight meetings between these two squads have limboed under 220 points. If the stats from Brooklyn & Indiana’s last meeting are any indication (Brooklyn only hit 35% of their FGs…), tonight’s encounter should be a low-scoring one. I’m on the Under to hit, friends.

1jhayvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/regularcarreviews/comments/1jhayvs/my_pgrated_hate_letter_to_honda_crvs/,My PG-rated hate letter to Honda CR-Vs,"I've refrained from bringing this up because frankly it makes me sound absolutely insane, but I've gotten well past the point of being privy to confirmation bias, so now I'm going to say something about it.

What the hell is up with Honda CR-Vs? 

Why is it that every time I'm stuck behind someone in the left lane on the highway, it's always a CR-V? 

Why is it that every time I'm on a one lane city road behind someone going ostentatiously slow who clearly has no idea where they're going, it's a Honda CR-V? 

Why is it every time I spot an awful parking job, it's a Honda CR-V? Just kidding, it's usually the pickup truck drivers (RAM 2500s, you know who you are), but still.

There is something about that stupid god damn SUV with those grossly tall, abhorrent tail lights that attracts the most insufferable buyers. If you put a face to the back of the car, the tail lights make it look as if the car itself is crying because of the person driving it, and I don't blame it.

The Honda CR-V is the embodiment of ""would you still love me if I was a worm?"" Its drivers thrive on irrationality and unbridled chaos, catering to the most unreasonable driving maneuvers. If a 'Live, Laugh, Love"" wall ornament drove a car, it'd be a CR-V.

I've experienced this EXACT scenario TWICE on the same highway in just the past 72 hours alone:

You've been behind a Honda CR-V camping in the left lane on a busy highway for several miles now. Finally, you see a clear gap about to appear on the right. Once there's enough room to switch lanes, you move over and try to pass the CR-V. Once its driver sees a potential overtaker in their peripheral vision, the competitive primate gene developed by countless generations of natural selection kicks in, and they inexplicably floor it, because god forbid someone go faster than them on the highway. No, they are the king of the road. You are in the domain that they preside over, so you cannot pass without their word. The 200 pound husk of decaying flesh being piloted by a monkey brain guns it to 20mph+ over the speed they were going before, JUST so that you can't pass them. Once you dejectedly merge back into the left lane after they close the gap, the CR-V lets off the gas pedal and decelerates back to the same speed as before (which is matching the speed of all the other lanes), and you're back to square one. Rinse and repeat until your destination (or theirs). 

This phenomenon is not exclusive to CR-V drivers, and it tends to happen primarily in the city, but when the perpetrators are disproportionately represented by CR-Vs, you can't help but start to notice a trend.

When driving on country backroads with a dashed yellow line, I almost never have trouble trying to pass someone. Rural drivers are typically sympathetic and will even help you pass at times. But every now and then, you come across someone who swerves into the oncoming lane to arbitrarily prevent you from passing. It's that same primate brain taking the wheel as before. They cannot even begin to comprehend the fact that there is someone (typically everyone) who wants to go faster than them. Therefore,  you are nothing but a malicious instigator acting in bad faith to them, and it is their sworn duty to enact their asinine version of ""justice"" and prevent you from legally passing them for going 43 in a 55.
The individual behind the wheel of that car—the helpless slave to their primate instincts and inhibitions—JUST SO HAPPENS to be driving a GOD. DAMN. HONDA. CR-V. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

See a car flying through 4 lanes narrowly avoiding 10 other cars to make their exit at the very last second? You know the ""I turn now, good luck everybody else"" type of scenario? CR-V

Walking to a crosswalk and there's a car well past their white line and blocking your path directly on the pedestrian walkway? CR-V

Sitting at a red light in the left turn lane and a car coming from the right cuts a bad turn and almost sideswipes your front bumper when pulling onto the road you're on? CR-V

The car in front of you in the right turn lane abruptly stops at a green light because... there is a pedestrian 1500ft from the crosswalk? CR-V

Passing someone on a bendy multi-lane road during a curve, and their complete and utter lack of spatial awareness causes them to drift into your lane, forcing you to slam your brakes to avoid a collision? Kia Soul. Just kidding, of course it's a CR-V. I feel nothing but pity in the presence of a Kia Soul. For CR-Vs though...

It doesn't even matter what year it is. Whether it's the small ugly garbage can from the 90s with the spare tire on the rear or a brand spankin' new 2025 model year, their behaviors are the same regardless.

It's gotten to the point where things have gone full circle, and the pavlovian conditioning I've been subject to by CR-V drivers has caused me to fall victim to my own monkey brain; I feel a deep rooted, carnal vitriolic rage upon the sight of that disgusting vehicle.  I have never personally met a CR-V driver that hasn't seriously rubbed me the wrong way. Literally every single CR-V driver I have personally met has an incredibly abrasive personality rife with hypocrisy that's shrouded by superficial virtue signaling and moralistic grandstanding. If your HR manager was a car, they'd be a Honda CR-V. 

I wouldn't even wish physical harm upon CR-V drivers. They deserve nothing less than a lifetime of non-debilitating but constant pain, a lifetime of successive inconveniences hindering their way of a comfortable life. Let no toe go unstubbed, let no knee approach a coffee table without an unintended impact, let no ankle go unrolled. May all floor-bound Lego pieces find the foot of a CR-V driver.

The following is my final verdict, and should only be read by CR-V drivers:

Skin conditions are your body’s way of telling you that something isn’t right inside. Something we are eating or doing causes the inflammation. You can absolutely take drugs for it and continue eating or doing the things that cause inflammatory - but that isn’t getting to the root cause. These drugs can often damage your body in other ways through side effects. 

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian medical system that is more than 5,000 years old. Rosacea can be treated by healing digestion and cooling the body with diet, herbs and external applications.

*ROUTINE:*

*HERBS* - taken 2 - 4 times a day depending on which herb. 

Neem: Known for its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.
Amla: this scrapes away natural toxins. 
Avipattikar: cleanses and supports the liver.
Manjistha: A potent blood purifier that helps clear skin inflammation.
Brahmi: another anti inflammatory herb that helps with purifying the pancreas.
Ashwaganda: a natural way to lower cortisol (stress hormone), manage stress and help with sleep. 


*DIETARY CHANGES*

I cut out trigger foods and ate more of cooling and anti-inflammatory foods. 

*CUTTING OUT TRIGGER FOODS:*
I avoid these rosacea-aggravating foods: Spicy foods, sour foods, caffeine, and <u>alcohol: Particularly red wine, which dilates blood vessels and worsens redness. </u>
Pungent and strong hot beverages like coffee. Instead have green tea or matcha. 
Processed Foods: Often contain additives and preservatives that can trigger inflammation.

*INCREASING INTAKE OF:*
Cooling Foods: Cucumbers, melons, and leafy greens. 
Fatty Fish: Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce inflammation.
Green Leafy Vegetables: Packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties.
Berries: High in antioxidants, which help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation.
Nuts and Seeds: Contain healthy fats and antioxidants
Bitter and Astringent Foods: Kale, spinach, and pomegranates.

*LIFESTYLE*
Stress Management: Practicing yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises.
Avoiding Triggers: Identifying and avoiding foods and environmental factors that trigger flare-ups.
Skin Care: Using gentle, natural skin care products and avoiding harsh chemicals. I use the ordinary’s fermented rosehip oil and Shiseido night creams. I also cleanse my skin with coconut oil which I thought would be too heavy but Ayurveda studies show it’s good for rosacea prone skin due to its cooling properties. 
Vitamins supplements: Vitamin A, Zinc, Magensium, Biotin and Iron.

I’m 28M and I’ve been with my husband (29M) for 7 years, married for almost one. This has been a genuinely good relationship. I love him deeply, and we’ve built something I’m proud of. He fits in great with my family, and I’ve always felt at home with his. I’m close with his younger brother and his girlfriend, but the person I’ve always felt the strongest connection with is his mom.

A few years back, I went through a rough depressive episode, and she was one of the only people who truly showed up for me. She didn’t treat me like “her son’s partner,” she treated me like family. I’ve always loved her for that. I’m close with my FIL too, but with my MIL, it always felt like more of a friendship.

Then, everything flipped. Just after Christmas, my FIL sat us all down and told us that she had been having an affair, and that it wasn’t the first time. He said he tried to make things work, but he couldn’t do it anymore. He was heartbroken, and it shattered the whole family. My husband and his brothers were crushed. They all cut contact with her, and she moved out soon after.

I get it. Cheating is a betrayal, especially after decades of marriage. I’m not trying to excuse what she did. But I also couldn’t ignore the fact that, during one of the worst times in my life, she showed me care and kindness when I felt like I had no one. That stayed with me.

A few weeks ago, she reached out to me directly. She said she was running low on rent and didn’t know who else to ask. She sounded anxious and desperate. I helped her. It wasn’t a huge amount, and she was incredibly grateful. She asked if I’d be willing to meet her for coffee. I said yes.

When we met, she broke down. She told me she’d tried reaching out to her sons, but none of them responded. I listened. I didn’t try to defend her or fix anything. I just tried to be there for her, the way she once was for me.

Later that evening, I told my husband about it. He completely lost it. He said I betrayed him and went behind his back, and he left the house. The next day, I tried to explain where I was coming from. I told him I wasn’t trying to choose sides. I just reacted to someone I care about being in a tough spot. He didn’t say much, just told me not to do it again.

When his brothers found out, they were disappointed in me too. They said I crossed a line and should’ve respected their decision to cut contact.

Now I feel stuck. I understand why they’re upset. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone. I just couldn’t turn my back on someone who once didn’t turn her back on me. I wasn’t trying to undermine their pain. I was trying to act with compassion.

1jhamna,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jhamna/day_one_again/,Day one. Again.,"Hey folks,

Long and short, I've been drinking pretty heavily for longer than I'd care to think about. More or less since my early 20s, and I'm pushing 40.

The last few years have gotten pretty bad, though. I'm not a big dude and got to a point where I was pounding 1/2 to an entire bottle of whiskey a day, which...yeah. I don't recommend that. For a long time, I was able to mostly convince myself I was being a normal functional human, at least during the daytime hours. Gatherings / bars / nights in general were a different story, of course.

Last year, I got pretty hammered one night, went to bed and blackout/sleepwalked into a nasty leg wound (tripped and fell into an open computer I'd been working on in my home office). I actually didn't come to until she'd got me to the bathroom to try and staunch the bleeding. Had to have like 13 stitches. The whole ordeal got me on my first real attempt at quitting.

I made it to a bit past 60 days before the world and personal circumstances got to me and I started back up with even more vigor. This has caused a ton of strain in my marriage, my friendships, and my work life. Even my hobbies have fallen off the wayside. 

These are all at least still salvageable now, but I'm pretty damn sure if I keep up with the bottle that lines are going to start getting crossed that I can't come back from. Thankfully I don't have kids, but I sure as hell haven't been there to support my wife when she's needed it, or rationally talk things out if we have a disagreement.

Add in the fact that I'm really starting to feel the health effects and general brain-fog in the few hours where I'm not drinking, I really need to get a handle on this.

During the previous attempt, I had found this sub but was only lurking, so I'm gonna try and use this crusty old alt account to be more active here in hopes it can help provide a good routine for me to check in with myself on my progress, get help, and help others (sorry if the account looks sus, but I don't want to use my main for this and Reddit won't let you skip giving an email anymore so here we are).

All that said, today is the first day in months that I've woken up without a hint of a hangover. I was able to get up and actually *enjoy* a cup of coffee and start my Saturday without battling the nausea, which is a great step in the right direction.

I sent her a letter expressing my love and asking for another chance, but she said that she didn’t loved me anymore and that we should both move on. 

But since then, she keeps texting me here and then :
- she wished me a happy valentine’s day with my date (i had none) 
- she wished me good success in an exam im taking in September
- she asked me if I wanted her notes for the said exam
- she randomly called to check on me once
- and last night, she texted me at 3AM a pic of her saying that she was very pretty and that I was ugly, called me an asshole and saying that she hated me  (referring to this one time where I said she was mid as a joke (1year ago!).  

All of the previous times, I gave in and asked her out for a coffee or a movie, but she always said no rather harshly, with a complete switch of tone like I had been texting first.

Last monday, I asked her explicitly what she to wanted, to which she answered : « I want peace ». I obliged and left her alone.  

So i was surprised by her random text at 3AM last night, and called her this morning to check on her. She said that she was drunk and that there’s nothing else. 

So i asked her to stop that bc i’m not a disposable that you can throw and take back whenever you want. 

Then everything went south : she called an opportunistic asshole bc she said that I was happy to talked to her for a class notes, but not for the rest??? 
She then hang up on me and blocked me.

I posted a few weeks back about wanting to start up a ""coffee outside"" group bike ride, something a little bit slower-paced than the rides put on by the local shops and cycling clubs.

A few folks were interested and I started a Strava club called ""The Ramble"" to organize.

I somewhat arbitrarily chose this Sunday to be our first ""Bikes & Coffee"" ride (First Sunday in spring? Why not?!) It's going to be a bit brisk, but the first ride will be tomorrow (Sunday March 23) at 11AM, leaving from Bronson Park.

If you're interested, here's the link to the Strava club, with more details (and where future rides will be organized)

https://strava.app.link/lRywPdKMWRb

I also whipped up a quick website, if you're not interested in joining Strava, this will have up to date info on whatever the next ride is:

https://ramblekzoo.com/


TL;DR 
Quick hits:
- Start from Bronson Park
- 15-20 mile loop
- Pit stop mid-way to brew up some coffee in the woods
- If you've got the gear to make coffee outside, bring it, but I'll have a few steep-able bags of Factory Coffee to share",5,1742656297.0,kzoo,0,1.0,False

I tried four of the new Bees and the sampler set (all four) of the new Nui's Favorite Things. I was *sure* I'd love one of these new ones (and so I did), but I also had an unexpected true love from among the others as well. There were also some marvelously gourmand ones (a precursor, I suppose, to the forthcoming April Fools collection of all gourmands coming this Friday!).

Nui Cobalt Bees represent the start of spring for me. This collection has so much delicacy, airiness, honey-sweetness, and, of course, its stunning florals (and some darker, more resinous scents too, for folks who love those). For anybody who is newish to indies, Nui Cobalt's Bees collection features honey in various different forms (whipped, spiced, floral blossom-tinged) and I can say from experience that even if honey notes from other houses don't work on you, it's very well worth giving these a try. Honey can be a difficult note in perfume, often smelling like cat pee (with which it shares several chemical compounds), but NCD's don't have that problem. They've said outright that they create ""fantasy"" honey accords that evoke the smell and idea of honey but without the urine-like elements. Personally their white whipped honey is my favorite! But all of their honey accords - and they have at least four or five different ones - are all really special. And along with the Bees comes the smaller partner collection, Nui's Favorite Things, and we also still get the return of **Liquid Luck** from the long-ago collection Celtic Treasures.

**Ordering specs:** [Nui Cobalt's website](https://nuicobaltdesigns.com/) is easy to navigate, shipping is very affordable at $3.45, items come very securely packed, and customer service is always spectacular. I don't think I've ever placed an order that took more than 2-3 business days to ship (and recently it has usually been literally the very next day). Samples are generous - 1.15 mls at least - in vials with wand caps. Each order comes with one free sample, chosen by them (there’s no box to insert requests).

**Nui Cobalt's typical annual schedule of releases:** (I \[and especially Nui Cobalt\] make no promises, of course, that these collections will recur; this is just *in my experience*)

* Late January - Valentines (Philias, Crushes, Les Désirs Dangereux, and Babalon Exalted)
* Late February - Bees, Favorite Things (formerly also Celtic Treasures)
* Late March - April Fools
* Late April - Critters
* Late May - Fae Folk
* Late June - Big Island, Dances, Vision
* Late July - Witches' Utility Blends
* Late August - Autumn 1
* Late September - Autumn 2
* Late October - Astronomy, Whole Being, Astrology (formerly also Ascended Masters, Good & Evil)
* Late November - Yule/Nutcracker
* Late December - Geeks & Gamers

**A note about my preferences:** I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (especially honeysuckle, plumeria, tiare, and tuberose; though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn’t usually work on me). I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, leather, dragon’s blood, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general.

These perfumes were provided as press samples by Nui Cobalt in exchange for an honest review.

# Bees

**Empress Bee** \[White iris and creamy gardenia entwined with honey-drenched almond\] - If you love **Queen Bee** \[Creamy white gardenia and fluffy whipped honey\] (and I do!), this is a no-brainer! It's that same almost fizzy honeyed gardenia of **Queen Bee** with some extra muskiness from the almond and iris (I know it says ""white iris"" but to my nose it's definitely a purple iris). This is the same honeyed almond as in **Silver Fox** \[White tea with honey and rice milk, almond macaron, soft grey cashmere and cool woodland musk\], husky and creamy and altogether lovely (and not at all cherry-ish). And the addition of the almond and purple iris make make **Empress Bee** much more grown-up than the youthful **Queen Bee** (I could swear there's aldehydes in **Queen Bee** \- maybe that's what makes its honey ""whipped""?). **Empress Bee** is sophisticated and undeniably regal. I blind-FSed this and regret nothing. I *knew* I'd love it!

**The Thriae** \[Creamed honey, Shea butter, oats, sacred benzoin, and clean skin musk\] - Gently honeyed oats and cream, specifically oats rather than cooked oatmeal, with an undertone of powdery shea and orris. This is so soft and gentle and cuddly, very much in the same vein as **She Stopped to Pet a Bumblebee** \[Cocoa butter and shea, cotton flower, silk tree, apple blossom, wildflower honey, bee balm, and heliotrope\]. This will land in my ""my skin but better"" section. It does dry down even softer than it starts, one of my most skin-hugging, low-sillage scents.

**Aristaeus** \[Green grapes, benzoin, and bergamot converge with nectar gathered from linden blossom, cistus, and flowering thyme\] - Sticky-sweet, thick and syrupy honey, along with a sharp, strong grape that has an acidity similar to grapefruit (that must be the additional bergamot amping that, now I think about it), and an amber base. Sniffing my wrist right up close, I can make out some faint florals to the honey, but I don't get them from farther away. These florals are slightly dusty and herbal, not bold white florals or even greenish aquatic florals. I'm not familiar with flowering thyme (is it different from the dried thyme herb I cook with?) but either I'm not getting any savory herb vibe here, or it's floral enough that it's mixing with the linden and cistus.

**Protect Our Pollinators** \[Thorny brambles of red raspberry, a snap of rhubarb, dark honey spiced with clove bud and Indonesian mace, and delicate shade-grown violet\] - In the vial, it smells of dark spiced honeyed raspberry, but on my skin the raspberry and rhubarb combine to smell more like a syrupy black cherry (happily, not a cough-syrupy cherry). Joining it are an *intense* clove that reads like a hit of patchouli, and a woodsy-sweetness like maple wood (Husband says this reminds him of the maple syrup vibe of **Little Brown Rabbit**, one of his favorites on me). Often when Nui Cobalt has ""brambles"" listed in the notes (like in **Oath of Vengeance** or **Purple People Eater**, and here in **Protect Our Pollinators**), it manifests as a dark berry musk similar to **Alkemia Blackberry Noir**.

# Nui's Favorite Things

**Birdsong** \[Slender oak branches, yellow freesia, barely budding lilac, feather musk, and a bright spritz of petitgrain\] - The softness of lilac and the same feather musk as in my beloved **Snowy Owl** \[Dried coconut flakes, pale woods, frozen tuberose, vanilla orchid, and fluffy feather musk\], on a fainter base of wood and greenery. I was worried about the petitgrain, and while it does indeed go on a bit bitter, it settles very quickly, and creates a really beautiful, natural world-feeling base for this birdsong-themed perfume. The lilac is soft and gentle and less overtly musky than it can be, and gosh I *love* Nui Cobalt's feather musk. Altogether this is a beautiful and barely-there scent, incredibly pretty in an understated way. This feels incredibly ""spring"" and incredibly ""cottagecore"". Cottagecore for the introverted girlies. I love it and will definitely consider a FS!

**Birthday Cake for Breakfast** \[Fluffy vanilla cake adorned with weightless almond frosting and served with a hot cup of coffee\] - This could easily be an April Fools scent! It's gloriously gourmand, and very much evokes the feeling of cake for breakfast. I'm not normally wildly into coffee notes, but I fell in love last spring with **Parisian Apiary** \[Cherry blossom, silver linden, white pear, and cafe au lait sweetened with French honey\], and this is the same sort of coffee note - milky and creamy, without any hint of burnt or bitter. With this milky coffee is a thick slice of extremely vanilla white cake, fluffy and sweet, made with almond flour (I'm getting almond flour, specifically, rather than any cherry-ish almond extract type of scent, nor is it a honeyed almond like in **Silver Fox** or **Empress Bee**). This is where this perfume loses me; it's too sweet and much too ""cake"" for me, but I can see this one being a really huge hit with the gourmand-lovers. Here's hoping Forest does more with this cafe au lait note in future; it's really lovely.

**Clare's Homemade Chai** \[Ceylon cinnamon, white cardamom, nutmeg, star anise, allspice, clove bud, and coriander simmered in a smooth base of Madagascar vanilla\] - This isn't a chai latte or even a chai tea - there's no black tea; it's just the chai spiced simple syrup. One summer, we made a batch of spiced simple syrup by simmering a bunch of spices on the stove, then I added it to cold milk and it was just \*chef's kiss\*. This brings back memories of that summer! It's a suuupuer spicy mix, with a strong and almost savory kick from the coriander and peppercorn. A lot of American ""chai"" that you might get in a coffeeshop is mostly sugar plus some pumpkin spice, but this is bold and zesty and unapologetic. I tried layering it with **Blarney** \[The warm, tannic comfort of a proper Cuppa sweetened with a touch of raw honey and smoothed with fresh cream\], which is my perfect ""plain cup of tea"" scent, to see if I could create a really fantastic chai tea scent, and I thought it would work beautifully...but actually, **Clare's Homemade Chai** completely overpowered **Blarney**. It really is that audacious!

**A Constellation of Kindred Stars** \[Tropical ylang, golden amber, a glimmer of pink grapefruit, and smooth Moroccan musk\] - Incredibly smooth Egyptian musk, quite silky and a little bit salty, and this ""Moroccan"" musk is less, well, *musky* than their usual Egyptian musk. Here it's paired with golden amber (which smells very prominent in the vial but not so much on my skin) and a vibrant grapefruit that does well to add some acidity to the musk and amber (much like adding a garnish of lemon zest can brighten up an otherwise bland pasta dish). I haven't always gotten along with NCD's ylang ylang, but I don't notice any here.

# Personally...

I knew I'd love **Empress Bee**, and it didn't disappoint. I *didn't* guess I'd love **Birdsong** as much as I do! It's *so* pretty and *so* springlike, and it makes me want to sew a dress in a pastel lavender purple, maybe with a floral print, something delicate and understated, specifically to match it. I sew all my own dresses, and I often love matching my dress to that day's perfume. It takes a really *special* new perfume find to make me want to sew something new just to more perfectly suit it!

Gourmand-lovers, take note of **Birthday Cake for Breakfast** and **Clare's Homemade Chai**!

Hey everyone, I could really use some outside perspective.

I’m 28M and I’ve been with my husband (29M) for 7 years, married for almost one. This has been a genuinely good relationship. I love him deeply, and we’ve built something I’m proud of. He fits in great with my family, and I’ve always felt at home with his. I’m close with his younger brother and his girlfriend, but the person I’ve always felt the strongest connection with is his mom.

A few years back, I went through a rough depressive episode, and she was one of the only people who truly showed up for me. She didn’t treat me like “her son’s partner,” she treated me like family. I’ve always loved her for that. I’m close with my FIL too, but with my MIL, it always felt like more of a friendship.

Then, everything flipped. Just after Christmas, my FIL sat us all down and told us that she had been having an affair, and that it wasn’t the first time. He said he tried to make things work, but he couldn’t do it anymore. He was heartbroken, and it shattered the whole family. My husband and his brothers were crushed. They all cut contact with her, and she moved out soon after.

I get it. Cheating is a betrayal, especially after decades of marriage. I’m not trying to excuse what she did. But I also couldn’t ignore the fact that, during one of the worst times in my life, she showed me care and kindness when I felt like I had no one. That stayed with me.

A few weeks ago, she reached out to me directly. She said she was running low on rent and didn’t know who else to ask. She sounded anxious and desperate. I helped her. It wasn’t a huge amount, and she was incredibly grateful. She asked if I’d be willing to meet her for coffee. I said yes.

When we met, she broke down. She told me she’d tried reaching out to her sons, but none of them responded. I listened. I didn’t try to defend her or fix anything. I just tried to be there for her, the way she once was for me.

Later that evening, I told my husband about it. He completely lost it. He said I betrayed him and went behind his back, and he left the house. The next day, I tried to explain where I was coming from. I told him I wasn’t trying to choose sides. I just reacted to someone I care about being in a tough spot. He didn’t say much, just told me not to do it again.

When his brothers found out, they were disappointed in me too. They said I crossed a line and should’ve respected their decision to cut contact.

Now I feel stuck. I understand why they’re upset. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone. I just couldn’t turn my back on someone who once didn’t turn her back on me. I wasn’t trying to undermine their pain. I was trying to act with compassion.

So… was I wrong? AITA?",46,1742656172.0,AmItheAsshole,46,0.85,False

Watch the video tutorial below:

The scariest part? It did the job better than most freelancers I've hired.

Here's the shocking truth: That $500 task you're paying someone to do? An AI just did it for $1.30 while I sipped coffee.

And I'm going to show you exactly how to set it up in the next 5 minutes.

# The Browser-Controlling AI That Changes Everything

What makes these one-click AI agents with RooCode and Claude different is simple:

They can control your actual browser with all your logins.

Think about what that means:

Your AI can now log into ALL your tools. It can interact with ANY website. It can automate EVERYTHING you do online.

I didn't believe it either until I watched it happen right in front of me.

In the demo, my AI agent:

* Opened Chrome with my logins
* Wrote a complete blog post in Google Docs
* Ran detailed keyword research in Ahrefs
* Built and deployed a website in Bolt New
* Created a calorie tracking system in Google Sheets
* Had a conversation with ChatGPT (AI talking to AI!)

All from simple instructions like ""go to Ahrefs and do keyword research for my SEO agency.""

# The 60-Second Setup Anyone Can Do

The best automation is the one you'll actually use.

That's why I love this setup - it takes less than a minute:

1. Download Visual Studio Code (free)
2. Install the RooCode extension (free)
3. Run ONE terminal command (I provide it)
4. Connect your Claude API key

That's it. No coding. No complex setup. No technical knowledge required.

I've seen people spend entire days trying to configure AI agents with complicated code and terminal commands.

With this setup? You'll be watching your AI work in less than 5 minutes.

# Why These AI Agents Outperform Human VAs

Let's be real about virtual assistants:

* They need training on each tool
* They make consistent mistakes
* They work limited hours
* They cost thousands per month

These AI agents?

* They figure out ANY tool instantly
* They follow instructions perfectly
* They work 24/7, including weekends
* They cost pennies compared to human labor

I watched in disbelief as the AI navigated to Bolt New (a tool it had never seen) and immediately figured out how to use it, create a website, and deploy it.

No tutorials needed. No training required. It just works.

# Keyword Research: 5 Minutes vs. 5 Hours

SEO agencies charge hundreds for keyword research.

With this AI agent setup, I simply said:

""Go to [Ahrefs.com](http://Ahrefs.com) and do some keyword research for my SEO agency""

The AI:

* Navigated to Ahrefs
* Logged in
* Found the keyword explorer
* Entered relevant search terms
* Analyzed search volumes and difficulty
* Compiled a complete report

Total time? 5 minutes. Total cost? Pocket change.

And the results were just as good as what I'd get from a professional SEO researcher.

# AI vs. AI: The Ultimate Showdown

One of the most mind-blowing moments was watching Claude talk to ChatGPT.

I simply told my AI agent:

""Go to ChatGPT and start having a cheeky conversation with it""

What happened next was surreal.

Claude navigated to ChatGPT and started challenging it about how many tennis balls can fit in a limousine, then proceeded to critique ChatGPT's answer.

I was watching two AI systems have a conversation, with my AI controlling the browser.

This is the future, happening right now on your computer.

# Quality Control Is Still Key

One important thing to remember: AI isn't perfect.

While these agents can automate almost anything, you still need to check their work.

The good news? Reviewing AI work takes seconds compared to doing the work yourself.

I recommend starting with smaller tasks, reviewing the output, and gradually increasing the complexity as you build trust.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Do I need coding knowledge to use this?

None! If you can copy and paste, you can set this up.

# Is this better than Manus AI?

In many ways, yes. Manus runs in a virtual environment, while this runs in your actual browser with all your logins.

# Will this work with my specific tools and websites?

If it works in Chrome, the AI can automate it.

Looking for a roommate to join me in my apartment in North Park Slope on April 1st. This is a unique layout where you'd get two rooms for the price of one. Ideally looking for a 12 month commitment, but possibly flexible.

* Main bedroom is spacious with two windows in the rear of the apartment.
* The office/extra room is a sizeable room (has been used as a bedroom) you can use for anything you want (well, within normal shared apartment etiquette). This is perfect for a WFH set up, freelancers, or anyone who wants the luxury of having some private space separate form their bedroom.
* Utilities about $75 most months.

Neighborhood

* Laundromat is right on the corner (literally a two-minute walk)
* Atlantic Avenue subway station is a seven-minute walk. That's the most connected station in Brooklyn with 2/3/4/5/B/D/N/Q/R access.
* There's also another 2/3 stop slightly closer.
* The neighborhood has almost everything within walking distance: barbers/salons, hardware, grocery, bodegas, several restaurants, coffee, thrift stores.... There's a new bookstore and a record store nearby.

About Me: Male in my 30s. Professional, clean, and respectful. Work a 9-5. Enjoy art, exploring the city, going to the gym, and music. Gay (so LGBTQ+ friendly apartment, obviously,).

I came to Canada as PR on March 31st, 2024, and started working by the end of April. Since then, I’ve been doing a few odd jobs—mostly as a gas station cashier at Petro-Canada and 7-Eleven, and currently working as an Uber Eats driver.

There was a period where I was out of work for about a month or two, during which I received Ontario Works benefits to stay afloat. I'm extremely meticulous with my spending—I’ve saved receipts for literally every purchase I’ve made: coffee, gas, groceries, clothes, prescription medications, humidifier, etc. If I spent a dollar, I kept the receipt.

Now before anyone assumes I came here just to rely on the system—I’m a licensed dentist from Pakistan, and I didn’t move here to settle for odd jobs. I’m currently working on getting my Canadian dental license, which is a long and expensive process (thousands already spent on exams and thousands more to go).

I only bring this up because every time I share my situation online—PR holder, doing odd jobs, Ontario Works benefits —people start judging me, calling me a parasite or saying I’m leeching off the system. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Canada invited me here as a healthcare professional because of the dental workforce shortage. I’m actively working toward contributing to that system—I just have to get licensed first, and that takes time.

I hope to get my dental radiography license by May, which will open the door to dental assistant roles while I continue the path to becoming fully licensed here.

So, back to my actual question—this is my first-ever tax season in Canada, and I want to make sure I do things right.

I have no major assets besides my car, which I financed, and I haven’t done any other work aside from what I mentioned.

So here’s what I need help with:- 

(1) Should I file my taxes myself, or is it better to get a tax agent or broker?

(2) Would all the receipts I saved actually help in any way?

Any tips or recommendations for newcomers filing taxes for the first time would be hugely appreciated!

We are meeting again this Sunday 10:30 at Collab coffee. 

Who’s invited: anyone who is watching their country being destroyed.  Veterans, educators, women, people of color, library lovers, social security receivers, those in enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid, those who want there to be preschool for their kids not just the rich kids, those who think it’s insane to even talk about deporting Americans instead of using our own justice system, those who are devastated that they are taking pictures of women out of every government office like they don’t exist, those who want there to be fema when a tornado comes through Tulsa, the list goes on. 

Many of you think you can wait this out, that it isn’t that bad, that there is nothing you can’t do but our efforts are already making an impact. What we need is people, we need voices. We need the internet warriors and the outspoken. We need the quiet watchers and the creatives. 

Such a small percentage of Oklahomans voted for trump. And an even smaller percentage are actually trump cultists. We outnumber them but not if we stand apart. 

You don’t have to agree with everything,  but if you show up Sunday I’ll help connect you to people who are passionate and working to solve the same issues you want solved.

For debloating, I ran Chris Titus's utility, uninstalled anything I wasn't using, and removed all the Asus/Armoury Crate junk to replace with G-helper. 

While this isn't on the level of Mac's battery life, it is still amazing and plenty enough for many's needs.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’ve been documenting my TMS journey for over a year, and I wanted to share my experience starting with the first few days of treatment almost 2 years ago. If anyone here has advice or can relate, I’d love to hear from you.

Day 1 (28 June 2023): Mapping Appointment Day  
I had told the office I didn’t want to start treatment until after my marathon and family trip. But when I arrived, the technician thought I’d start that day. We explained my concerns about missing three weeks of sessions, but the doctor assured us it would be fine and convinced me to begin treatment.  

The mapping itself wasn’t terribly bad, but it was uncomfortable. However, the first electromagnetic pulse during the session was excruciating. It felt like an ice pick being slammed into my brain. I told the doctor the pain was a 8 or 9 out of 10, but the session continued for the full 19 minutes. Afterward, I was in intense pain, disoriented, and emotional. I burst into tears once exiting the office and stared and drooled at the wall when I got home. 

Day 2 (29 June 2023): Second Round of TMS 
I returned for Day 2, but we made it clear that if the staff didn’t address our concerns, I would stop. The one who introduced herself as the ""more experienced tech"" reduced the intensity to 45% from 50% explaining that was the lowest it could go and adjusted the coil. The pain was still terrible. Despite feeling spacey afterward, I felt a bit reassured that the staff was listening. I was also told this tech and the doctor would be in the office the next day to help. 

Day 3 (30 June 2023): Third Round of TMS 
On Day 3, neither the experienced tech nor the doctor were there. The younger tech that took my session was indifferent and just stood by the computer with little interest, and the pain was worse than Day 2—like Thor hammering my brain. I also developed motor coordination issues, like knocking over a coffee mug when trying to place it on a bedside table. I immediately burst into tears, which was abnormal. 

Looking back at these 3 days, I learned several mistakes that were made by the staff as a result of consulting the manual and overall, reflecting on how they handled my situation. 

1. Allergic Reaction. Before treatment I was prescribed gabapentin and I was told that it would help TMS be more effective. Upon taking this, my whole side of my face went numb and I was sluggish. I could not get ahold of the doctor, but I told her staff. The day of mapping, she had no idea of my adverse reaction. 

2. Pressure to Begin Immediately. The pressure to start treatment immediately after mapping should have been a red flag, and I deeply regret caving to this pressure. 

3. Improper Mapping. During the mapping, I understood we were supposed to be finding movement in my thumb, but after trying the mapping along the motor cortex on the left side of my head moving forward and back, the only digit that moved was my ring finger, no where near my thumb. The doctor said this was odd but we should try moving forward from where they saw my ring finger move. 

3. Improper Protection. We were never offered ear protection. The manual specifically outlined wearing ear protection due to the loudness and proximity to the machine pulsing. 

4. No Option to STOP. In thr mannual, it specificall mentions stopping due to SEVERE pain and this was never offered as an option, but instead I was told, ""they have never seen this level of sensitivity"" and ""I should get used to it"". I was also offered a silk cap to wear during my third session as if fabric would prevent further damage. 

5. Missing Doctor. After I was told that the experienced tech and doctor would be present on Day 3, and there was no explanation to their whereabouts, this should have been more of a red flag.

Imagine waking up to a tax audit notice or realizing you’ve overpaid thousands in taxes—just because of sloppy bookkeeping. Scary, right? Unfortunately, this happens more often than you think.

For small business owners, freelancers, and entrepreneurs, bookkeeping might seem like an administrative chore. But here’s the harsh reality: poor bookkeeping isn’t just an inconvenience—it’s a silent business killer. It leads to lost profits, tax penalties, cash flow nightmares, and even business failure.

Your competitors are already optimizing their finances. Are you keeping up, or are you falling behind? Let’s uncover the hidden costs of poor bookkeeping and, more importantly, how to fix it before it’s too late.

**The True Cost of Poor Bookkeeping**

**1. Lost Revenue & Missed Opportunities**

If your books are disorganized, you’re likely losing money in ways you don’t even realize.

❌ Unbilled Work – Forgetting to invoice clients means working for free.  
❌ Missed Deductions – Poor expense tracking means overpaying on taxes.  
❌ Overestimated Cash Flow – Thinking you have more money than you do can lead to overspending.

*Case Study:*  
Emma, a freelance graphic designer, realized she had forgotten to invoice a client for a $3,500 project—three months after completion! By implementing automated invoicing, she never missed a payment again.

 Fix It Fast: Use invoicing tools like QuickBooks or FreshBooks to track payments automatically.

2. Tax Penalties & Nightmares

The tax authorities doesn’t care if your bookkeeping is a mess. If you file late, underreport income, or miscalculate deductions, you’ll face hefty penalties.

 The Risks:

* Late tax filings = penalties + interest fees
* Incorrect deductions = red flags for an audit
* Poor record-keeping = missed tax refunds

Real-Life Example:  
A small business owner misclassified expenses and underreported revenue. Result? A tax audit and a $10,000 fine.

Fix It Fast: Keep organized financial records and work with a bookkeeper to ensure accurate tax filings.

**3. Cash Flow Crisis & Business Instability**

Your books should help you make smart business decisions. If they’re inaccurate, you’re flying blind.

🔴 Scaling Too Quickly: Hiring staff or expanding before your finances are stable.  
🔴 Overspending on Non-Essentials: Without proper tracking, you may not see where you’re bleeding money.  
🔴 Loan Rejections: Banks require clean financial records for approvals.

Example:  
A coffee shop owner expanded to a second location without realizing that cash flow wasn’t strong enough. Within six months, both locations struggled, leading to financial disaster.

Fix It Fast: Review financial reports monthly and forecast cash flow quarterly.

**4. Payroll & Vendor Payment Disasters**

Employees and vendors expect to be paid on time. Poor bookkeeping can destroy relationships.

Common Issues:

* Late payroll = unhappy employees & potential lawsuits
* Missed vendor payments = damaged credit & supply chain problems
* Incorrect tax withholdings = IRS fines

Illustration:  
A digital marketing agency forgot to pay a key freelancer on time. The freelancer stopped working with them, delaying a major client project.

Fix It Fast: Use automated payroll systems like Gusto or ADP to avoid payment mistakes.

**How to Fix Poor Bookkeeping (Before It’s Too Late!)**

1. Get Organized Today

Start with the basics:  
✔ Go Paperless – Use tools like Dext to store receipts digitally.  
✔ Separate Finances – Have a dedicated business bank account.

***Businesses that automate their finances save 10+ hours per week—while those that don’t are stuck in financial chaos.***

3. Hire a Professional (Before It’s Too Late!)

* Saves time so you can focus on business growth

Me and my friends thought it was a bad idea ( and it actually was) but then we came up with the idea that this is one in a life time experience so we went into the house . The second I stepted at this house I was ready to vomit there was around 5-6 dead dogs with sheep's and a cranium of a person. We ran out imideantly 
And with some masks we went in just to double check what we saw was right. We were actually right all of these were there . We ran again and went to the lake 30 minutes after we went again just to see that everything was missing. It wasn't even passed that much of a time. It started raining and we heard a voice mimicing a human one but it was like metal we ran and never came back. from what I remember the thing that talked to us had an strange aura like a wendigo.

by c.w. cobblestone



Aunt Sheila ended up staying with us for a month, and by the time she said goodbye, she’d accomplished her goal of indoctrinating me to enjoy my servitude, having purged all negative thoughts from my sissy little brain. While doubt and resentment about my situation still occasionally surfaced for a second or two, my cognitive processes had been completely rewired, thanks to the regime my master’s aunt had subjected me to: Sleep and food deprivation, constant confusion and relentless negative reinforcement. 



I even came to embrace the idea of getting breast implants and becoming a eunuch, which was an indication of how powerful the old lady’s brainwashing methods were. In my new way of thinking, if my betters wanted me to have boobs and no balls, then it simply had to be a good thing. There was no room for any other possibility. 



I had made inroads toward acceptance before, fervently vowing to be the best maid possible before falling into despair after some new hardship or humiliation took the wind out of my sails. But I knew I’d arrived in a different place a few days before Aunt Sheila departed, when she called me up to her room, and instead of thinking, “Ugh, what’s the old bitch want now?” I found myself hoping she would use and even punish me. I got my wish.



She pegged me with that ridiculously huge strap-on, and then went to town with the cane on my ass and back while I worshipped her pussy — and I loved every minute of it. I still felt the pain, but no longer hoped for it to stop. As I was being pegged and flogged, I kept telling myself, “You’re providing Aunt Sheila with an outlet for her frustrations. It’s a wonderful thing!” And each time she farted in my face while I licked her, I said a silent thank-you.



I’d tried such mental gymnastics before, although this time, I actually believed myself.



Previously when I’d snap out of sub space, I’d spend hours berating myself for being such a spinless wimp. But I had reached a different plateau; a place where such self-loathing didn’t exist. All that mattered was serving my betters, and making their lives easier. It felt like I had been given some kind of mood-altering drug, because no matter what happened, nothing fazed me.



Mia’s finger-snaps no longer felt humiliating; they prompted me to provide quicker, more respectful service.



When I brought Liz and Cody coffee each morning, I prayed my master would allow me to serve as his urinal — and I usually got my wish.



Even seeing my beloved mistress cuddling in her lover’s muscular arms no longer caused jealousy. Instead, I was glad Liz had reunited with the love of her life, who made her a lot happier than I ever had as her so-called husband.



After Aunt Sheila went home, our household settled into a routine that satisfied everyone’s needs. Mia, Liz and Cody continued being rude to me. Brooke, while treating me kindly, had no problem working me like a dog if she wanted something. Behind closed doors, Cody still sexually abused and debased me, alone and in front of my smirking Mistress. He still pissed in my mouth almost every morning. And we still operated under the check mark system, with my Friday night punishments becoming a family tradition.



But eventually my betters, including Mia, toned down the nastiness. Sometimes, one of them might be in “a mood” and punish me for no reason, but for the most part, while I still faced discipline for infractions, rarely were check marks meted out “just because.”



My operations were successful. Aunt Sheila’s doctor friend/client was indeed a genius, and by the time he finished with me, I passed for a thirty-something maid with bee-stung, Botox-filled lips, 34-C silicone boobs and a phat plastic ass that Cody loved slapping and reaming at the same time.



Despite my brainwashing, it took time to adjust to life as a eunuch, although one immediate benefit was being able to ditch that cumbersome chastity cage, since there was no need to keep me horny. Eventually, though, I came to cherish my status as my masters’ sexless sissy slave.



Liz and Cody tried, but were unable to conceive, which my master blamed on being exposed to truck full of chemicals while serving in Afghanistan. 



Professionally, though, things improved for my masters. After Raul performed his behind-the-scenes magic, Mrs. Carrington was squeezed out Liz was named CEO of her firm. Cody, after becoming bored sitting around all day sexually using me and collecting an Army pension, opened a small tackle store near Lake San Cristobal.



The next few years zoomed by. Brooke, captain of the equestrian team during her senior year, graduated from Central High with honors, and was awarded the Plateau Horseman's Hall of Fame Scholarship, which earned her a full ride to Colorado Mesa University. After Mia graduated from high school two years later, she eschewed college and used a loan from her parents to open a vintage clothing shop in Lake City. Since the store and college were nearby, both girls continued living at home.



When my duties weren’t needed at the homestead, Mia used me for free labor at her store, where she enjoyed showing off for her three employees and customers who shopped at the edgy outlet. It gave me a thrill to be able to provide Miss Mia the opportunity to boost herself at my expense.



I was perfectly content in my life by that point, although my mental outlook was considerably better than what was happening to me physically, as I began to wear down from overwork, and felt tired all the time.



But when my mistress wandered into the living room one night holding a small pen-like device in her hand and a shocked expression on her face, I knew my workload was about to increase exponentially. 



“It’s positive,” she announced to the family. “I’m pregnant.” She beamed at Cody. “We finally did it.”

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the MLS, where the drama is as unpredictable as a soap opera, and the goals are as rare as a polite New Yorker in rush hour. This weekend, we have a clash of the titans—or perhaps more accurately, a clash of the ""trying really hard""—as Los Angeles FC takes on Sporting Kansas City.

Los Angeles FC is currently on a three-game losing streak, which is about as comforting as a lukewarm cup of coffee on a Monday morning. Despite their valiant efforts, they've managed to score just four goals in four matches. It's like they're trying to win a game of soccer with the power of positive thinking alone. Meanwhile, Sporting Kansas City has finally secured their first point of the season with a thrilling 3-3 draw against Minnesota United. It's a classic case of ""better late than never,"" but hey, at least they're fighting, according to their head coach, Peter Vermes.

Now, let's talk odds. The bookmakers have this match tighter than a pair of skinny jeans after Thanksgiving dinner. FanDuel has LAFC at 2.45 and Sporting KC at 2.65, with a draw priced at 3.4. The odds are so close, you'd think they were trying to predict the outcome of a coin toss.

Given the underdog win rate in soccer, and the fact that LAFC is struggling to find the back of the net, my best bet is to go with the draw at 3.4. It's like betting on two tortoises to finish a race at the same time—slow and steady, but ultimately, nobody really wins.

So, grab your popcorn, sit back, and prepare for a match that could very well end in a thrilling 0-0 draw. Or, if we're lucky, maybe someone will accidentally score a goal. Either way, it's bound to be an entertaining 90 minutes of soccer.

Part of it is the actual food (shocking), but it goes beyond that— when we take food vouchers, we speak to the person, ascertain allergies, dietary requirements, preferences and if they need any non-food items, and we see if we can redirect them to anyone who can actually help, like housing and financial advisors or mental health advocates. For rough sleepers or people without a permanent address, it can be difficult to run safeguarding without it, and I love my job.

It’s a good job. I see all sorts of people. Part of my job is making and serving hot drinks, which matters plenty especially when it’s cold outside— I serve tea, coffee, hot squash, water, and I can be convinced to do a little hot chocolate although we hardly ever have enough. I also hand out biscuits and I like giving extras sometimes.

Anywho, the other day, someone came in and asked for eight sugars in their tea. Eight! If you want to do the maths, that’s fourty five grams of sugar, or just under a quarter of the cup! Obviously, I obliged, and I hand counted each teaspoon, but was I gobsmacked? Absolutely! It didn’t stop me from giving the guy a biscuit, but there you are.

On the same day, we had a family come in, with two of the politest children I’ve met. One of the kids asked me for a tea, and because he was so little, I asked him if he wanted it strong or weak— he didn’t get it, so I asked him if he wanted the tea a dark brown or a light brown. He said dark. And then, for the second time that day, he asked for eight spoons of sugar! But he was so nice about it, I obviously couldn’t help but do it for him, and more biscuits.

Writing this all out, I’ve just remembered a third client that day. He asked for tea with two sugars, but later came up to the counter and asked for two more. Four isn’t a crazy amount, so I spooned them in, but he didn’t even let me stir it! He just took it and drank it, satisfied. Satisfied with what, seeing as all the sugar went straight to the bottom of the cup, I’ll never know! 

I don’t know what happened that day. We were overrun by sugar fiends. And I love sugary drinks, I like syrup and sugar and hot chocolate. I’ve got an incredible sweet tooth and my enamel resents me for it. But even I was absolutely flabbergasted. Floored. Knocked for a loop, if you will.

1jh9mun,https://www.reddit.com/r/FruitsBasket/comments/1jh9mun/ill_never_get_over_the_valentines_day_omake_in/,"I'll never get over the Valentine's Day omake in Fruits Basket Another Volume 4! I love it to bits, and this is why:","I've put a Spoiler Warning on this post, since it is dealing with Fruits Basket Another content and I include imagery from the final volume of Fruits Basket Another. That being said, I won't be using spoiler tags when talking about all of this in the post, since there is already a spoiler warning on the post itself.

Anyway, getting to the actual post and its contents:

It's quite common to hear fans talk about how they wish there had been more queer rep in Fruits Basket. I'm sure all of us here have heard these discussions before, usually it often involves Ayame and the thought that he was a missed opportunity to explore a gay Zodiac Member/gay couple, etc. But, I'm not here to really talk about that, I'm here to talk about the very short Valentine's Day omake at the very end of Fruits Basket Another Volume 4.

This omake is completely textless with the exception of a text message that Tohru gets. But what I really want to talk about here is what is said, or rather implied, within this textless omake (though, I will also be talking about that text, lol). 

In this omake we see Shiki baking cookies with the help of Mutsuki's family. Mutsuki is the son of Yuki and Machi and we see other members from Yuki's family there like Chizuru (Ayame and Mine's son). It's been a while, but I also want to say that the boy in the black sweater is Kou (Kakeru and Komaki's son), please correct me if I am wrong about that though!

https://preview.redd.it/6wwtmpzbo8qe1.png?width=306&format=png&auto=webp&s=377f9d32930e768129230c79c38a5b44648caed5

We see Mutsuki with his phone out, taking photos and maybe a video as well. And while it isn't shown here in the image (another part of the omake shows this) but Shiki is making cookies (a sort of white/vanilla and chocolate cookie). The omake then shows us what Sawa, the FMC of the series (a non-Sohma) is doing:

https://preview.redd.it/lf9bnjoto8qe1.png?width=309&format=png&auto=webp&s=94258858f840e5b7e1a1cf0a83118003d2471755

She's baking chocolate cupcakes with her friends from school. Sora (Haru and Rin's daughter) is there as is Hajime (Kyo and Tohru's oldest son). We then get an image of Sawa and Shiki meeting up and then:

https://preview.redd.it/xh6sr8axv8qe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58cf653f15a3b905c507d3fb7fd30e18f1cb3f9e

We are shown images of Sawa and Shiki exchanging the cookies and cupcakes they made for each other, Akito and Shigure enjoying the same cookies that Shiki made with each other (along with some other sweets and tea or coffee), and then...we see Hajime and Mutsuki eating the sweets too (let's put a pin in that). 

The text message is one that Tohru gets (and the whole Kyoru family checks it out along with Tohru). At first I thought it was from Hajime, since it is Tohru that the message is being sent to, and I also briefly thought that it might have been sent from Mutsuki because he is shown with his phone out while Shiki was making the actual cookies, but then I realized it was from Akito. There's a photo shown just above the text:

https://preview.redd.it/p05lzrrmw8qe1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8f45dfbf4a36883fb1bccc210b8f513917c471c

That shows the other sweets that Akito and Shigure are eating together in their image. So the text message is from Akito and states: ""Shiki made Valentine's cookies for the girl he likes."" That's the only text we are shown or given throughout this whole omake. Everything else is shown and expressed through visual storytelling. So what does that mean for Hajime and Mutsuki? 

Well, first let's talk about how we are seeing a less ""traditional"" Japanese Valentine's Day scenario playing out in this omake. Both Shiki (a boy) and Sawa (a girl) are making treats (and not just chocolate) for *each other* for Valentine's Day. In Valentine's Day there are different kinds of chocolate: 

Tomo Choco - Friend Chocolate - Chocolate that friends give to each other (usually girls).

Giri Choco - Obligation Chocolate - Chocolate that female workers usually give to their male co-workers.

Honmei Choco - True Feelings Chocolate - Chocolate that a girl/woman gives to a man that she has genuine feelings for (a crush, a boyfriend, husband, etc.). 

It would be one thing if we were seeing a more traditional Valentine's Day scene with only the female characters presenting chocolates to the male characters and then we were getting shown examples of the different kinds of chocolates that are given (Tomo, Giri, Honmei), but we aren't. We are just shown examples of Honmei Choco (Shiki and Sawa as potential boyfriend and girlfriend, Shigure and Akito as husband and wife), and then we have Hajime and Mutsuki. It really seems to be implying that Hajime and Mutsuki are boyfriends or like each other romantically.

Some may argue that this is just meant to be an example of Tomo Choco, but we aren't given any other examples of that and the juxtaposition is definitely meant to mean something, imo. Hajime and Mutsuki are shown having some relationship subtext in Another (Mutsuki watching over Hajime sleeping is similar to Kyo watching over Tohru sleeping or Haru watching over Rin sleeping, or Mutsuki stating that even if he and Hajime are physically apart from each other because of Hajime moving away for college ""our hearts will always be close.""). There's quite a bit of subtext, Mutsuki is also shown to be similar to Ayame in many ones - one of which is that he likes to dress up in dresses, and Takaya-sensei also goes out of her way to confirm things on Twitter like ""Mutsuki doesn't end up with Kyo and Tohru's daughter,"" and ""the man we see at the end is Kyo and Tohru's second son and his wife and family, not Hajime."" So...there's groundwork there for this reading and interpretation.

It's still not an out and out canon gay or queer couple in Furuba, but I feel like Hajime and Mutsuki are meant to be interpreted like that - especially with the Valentine's Day omake. That felt like a soft-confirmation of the reading that they are gay and are in a relationship together. It's still open to interpretation, but it still makes me really happy and giddy to think about that one image of Hajime and Mutsuki exchanging Valentine's Day chocolates together! I just think about it on occasions sometimes and often write about it over on Tumblr, so I just wanted to share my thoughts on it here on this subreddit too. I also like to headcanon that the cat and mouse stuffed animals we see Kyo and Tohru's granddaughter holding are gifts from her gay uncles Hajime and Mutsuki, lol. But yeah, sorry this post is so long and feel free to share your thoughts on this! Or just to appreciate Hajime x Mutsuki as a pairing!",4,1742653643.0,FruitsBasket,2,0.84,False

I met a really cool neighbor and we made plans last month to hang out but then I got COVID. We tried to reschedule and then she got sick. We finally agreed to go to lunch right down the street and I made reservations. Last night I ended up getting one hour of sleep because of my chronic illness and my body constantly being in “fight or flight” mode. I really didn’t want to cancel on her because it had been the third time trying to make plans and I don’t have many friends where I live so I was willing to push myself. I asked if we could grab a quick cup of coffee and explained to her that I didn’t sleep last night but didn’t want to cancel. She suggested a place 20-30 mins away when we were originally going down the street. I asked her if we could go to the coffee shop literally 500 ft from where we live since I didn’t sleep and I didn’t want to cancel on her. I felt bad asking already and then I saw her text and she said she doesn’t like that coffee shop so we should just reschedule.

he Is such a respectful gentleman. over the time ive gotten to know him under the pretence as friends, im slowly developing a crush because he is mostly what I look for in a partner. at car meets he’ll hang around me and make sure im okay and when trucks/cars are passing by he’ll even move me out of the way. recently he’ll call me here and there and we speak for about an hour on the phone each time, and he’s opened up to me about some emotional/deep things.

well, in one of these phone calls he said he wanted to meet for dinner, and that I wouldn’t have to worry about driving and that he ‘d pick me up, and that he’d throw a rock at my window so that i know that he’s there (I thought that was so cute omg). mind you, we met for coffee and dessert a few times before this and he would pay every time. every time we hang he's always staring at my lips - does this mean anything? and when we went out for dinner and he wouldn’t let me pay, and on our way back home we were sharing and exchanging our music tastes, and he kept taking detours and the longer way back home so that he would listen to my favourite tunes. during this meeting he told me he was getting a lot of pressure to get married from his family.

well, fast forward to today, I post a cute prayer on my instagram story saying that hopefully by next year we’re all with our spouses in houses filled with love and blessings. he replied to it saying “We need to find you a husband!” and I was so shook - what could he mean by that???

Generally speaking, a lot of these sorts of posts relate to lighter roasted, higher quality coffees and users are experimenting with different gear, water, and brewing approach to get the most out of those coffees. I’m really curious to know what level of extraction people are targeting. A lot of competition recipes are designed to produce punchy high strength low extraction brews, while some modern brewers are optimized to blow past the ceiling of the SCA recommended zone at 22%. Of course taste is king, but I do think understanding %EY and what you’re going for is a huge tool for comprehension and repeatability, and the tools for calculating it are more accessible than ever before.

Personally for the longest time I was shooting for between and EY between 22-27%, utilizing ratios between 1:18-1:20 and deploying fine grinds and high temp in zero bypass brewers,  with tools like the melodrip to really push extraction. I have found a few brew profiles that I really love and return to from these exercises—particularly on the Tricolate. But as of late I’ve been playing with slightly stronger ratios around 1:16.5-1:17.5, grinding coarser, using cooler water, and targeting EY between 20-23% and have really been enjoying the results.

For reference I use a ZP6, zero water with my own soft Lotus profile, and brew with the CAFEC flower, Orea porcelain, and the Tricolate. Occasionally I use a melodrip. I use the DiFluid refractometer and find it’s well calibrated to VST.  I primarily brew SEY, but play around with other roasters from time to time.

I worked in the industry for over a decade and am in an adjacent one now, but it’s still a lot of fun to play around with these things. I’m curious how others approach this as well, especially because I think it’s an essential piece of context when sharing or troubleshooting recipes and results. ",1,1742653261.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Feedback in comments,"I will only do more Springbok puzzles found at thrift stores or exchanges. For me, full price would not be worth the cost. Also, I would not recommend them for people who have dexterity challenges.

PROS: I liked the colorful image and enjoyed the way random cuts made assembling the more difficult areas easier. It was a nice change.

A puzzle with distinct areas with many individual features like this has is always my preference. I enjoyed that aspect.

Passes the lift test, though it curls. 


Cons: 

The pieces were a bit thin. The puzzle doesn't lay flat and required 2 handed manipulation and significant pressure to place many of them. Fully assembled, it still doesn't lay flat. Building it was similar to the Dollar store 100 piece ones I have, but with sturdier pieces.

I was concerned that the pieces would be crumbly due to the initial large amount of dust. It was more than any of my Ravensburgers, which I've seen many negative comments about. I was pleased that gently rubbing handfuls of pieces, then shaking them in a colander took care of it.
