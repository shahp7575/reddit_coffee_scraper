Whether true or not, some studies have shown something like a teaspoon of cinnamon a day can help with insulin sensitivity. 

But overall, im not looking for a miracle cure or a fast win. I just like cinnamon and im happy enough to try having more a day.

Trouble is finding ways that are tasty of getting it inside of me, so far I typically try to have some with a coffee or tea but it clumps, it can be horrible.

How could I get cinnamon in me, in a healthy tasty way?",1,1743790286.0,diabetes,2,1.0,False

1jrijph,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1jrijph/my_doctor_just_told_me_my_cane_will_make_me_worse/,My doctor just told me my cane will make me worse üòí,"I‚Äôm not diagnosed with POTS, but I‚Äôve been having symptoms that seem to point towards it for a few years, and have found that the at-home forms of treatment that POTSies mention as helping their symptoms, also alleviate mine, so I‚Äôve been trying to build up my courage to pursue a diagnosis, or if nothing else, diagnostic tests that can rule it out and figure out what is actually going on. You get what I mean. Anyway, I had a severe respiratory infection in September, and my symptoms have been worse since then, so I‚Äôve been walking with a cane to help with my fatigue, occasional dizziness, and my hypermobility (used to roll my ankles 1-3 times a week, all my life. Truly thought that was a normal experience for people, or that I just had weak ankles or smth. I haven‚Äôt rolled an ankle since September, when I started walking with the cane). 

I don‚Äôt go to see my doctor very often, partially because I‚Äôm fat, and I‚Äôm aware of how eager medical professionals are to attribute any and all of my symptoms (POTS or otherwise) at any given time to that factor, even though many of these symptoms are new and I‚Äôve been big all my life, as has my mom, who doesn‚Äôt experience most of my symptoms. The other part is that my doctor is kinda the type to send me for a test (for example, I had a 24hr ambulatory blood pressure monitor last year) and then when it comes back normal, she says, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre good!‚Äù And then. Sends me for no further follow up. And so I convince myself it‚Äôs nothing. Today, I had an appointment to see her, and I explained that/why I‚Äôve been walking with my cane, and she told me that a cane won‚Äôt help with my dizziness, that I should walk with activator poles instead. Yknow. Those ski-pole looking things that ppl use while hiking. And. Yeah I‚Äôm not doing that shit. It‚Äôs enough of a pain to have one thing permanently taking up my hand when I‚Äôm walking. Activator poles would mean that I can never check my phone while walking, carry a coffee, whatever. And to be quite frank, I think they look stupid. It‚Äôs taken so much work to feel comfortable being in public with a cane, to not feel like a total freak, to not wonder if everyone is staring at me and making judgements about who I must be based on what they can see, and I literally cannot imagine myself being able to be comfortable walking with activator poles in public, nor do I think they‚Äôd help me more than my cane. I think I‚Äôm just so tired of feeling unheard. She leaves me to fend for myself for years, and then has opinions about my choice of mobility aid. Ughhh. I‚Äôm so tired. I just wanna go home and cry. 

She‚Äôs sending me for a bunch of diagnostics, though. So that‚Äôs a win. And she‚Äôs referring me to see someone about my hypermobility. So that‚Äôs exciting. I just want it to be over. I just want to feel okay again. I miss the body I used to have, that let me do heavy lifting without having to lay down for days afterwards. I miss being able to just go do stuff, go for walks without worrying if I‚Äôm going to overdo it and strand myself somewhere, not be able to make the walk back. She said she ‚Äúusually sees those kinds of symptoms in people who are deconditioned, usually they‚Äôre older.‚Äù She said it like it‚Äôs not possible, but I heard it almost as an accusation. I probably am becoming deconditioned. I‚Äôm nearly 23. I shouldn‚Äôt feel old. If I could move more, I would. If I could get up and walk around more, I would. She has no idea how unstoppable I would be if I could just get up and move around as much as I want, or even move around enough to get all my household chores done in a week. If I could move as much as I want, I wouldn‚Äôt have been in her office today. I HATE having to lay down for hours and hours of my waking day, but lately, with the combination of my symptoms and a dozen stressors actively happening in my life, that is what I have to do, because even sitting up is hard a lot of the time. I get up, I go to school for as little time as possible, I go home, and I am so tired that all I can manage to do is to lay down. I get up to use the bathroom or to get food, and I go lay down again. I eat laying down. I do my work laying down. Sometimes when I‚Äôm at school, I have to take some time to lay down, so I can feel better and get through my day. I have forced myself to lay down for longer BECAUSE I have overdone it and sent myself into flares by trying to resist laying down. So yeah, when I can walk, I walk with a cane because yes, I‚Äôm probably becoming deconditioned. Is that not a red flag to you, Doctor? Do you care? Do you have any ideas at all about what can be done about it?? Because I‚Äôm open to basically anything. Other than frigging activator poles. ",1,1743790220.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

1jriifo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jriifo/sage_barista_express_not_reaching_pressure_sage/,Sage Barista Express not reaching pressure [Sage Barista Express],"Hi all,

Hoping someone will be able to help me with this issue. Since running a cleaning cycle on my Sage Barista Express, it has been struggling to grain sufficient pressure. I can only reach an appropriate level of pressure when switching to the double walled basket. This is obviously not ideal, and the coffee is watery and thin. I have used the allen key on the group head and tried to check for blockages but couldn't see anything wrong, although I don't know if I even would know what I'm looking for.

The strange thing is however: I had pulled a shot earlier in the day without issue, and after cleaning (I do a cleaning cycle twice, once without the cleaning tablet to make sure all is clear), I could no longer reach pressure. The dial would literally not be able to move at all. Same beans, exact same set up- finest grind, Lavazza Oro beans. I know these beans are mediocre, but budget constraints are real üòÖ I don't think the type of bean is very relevant anyway as it changed after cleaning.

I'd really appreciate it if someone had some ideas on what could be occurring. Thanks in advance",1,1743790128.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1jrii1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1jrii1x/why/,WHY....,"As a trans woman who lives her life full time in this god forsaken world. Why do some people see us as either mentally ill men dressed up as women or monsters? Men see me as a sex object to be thrown away after they are done. Some women look down on me as some sort of monster to hurt them, I am not that, if anything I want their help to understand what I need to do to help all of us. Why do politicians demonize trans women, most if not all of us just want to live our lives. We never wanted to be a political pawn. Ten years ago most of the general public had never heard of transgender people and now it's all that politician talk about. WHY?

I have been dealing with how I feel for my entire life. Growing up looking in the mirror and seeing my beard start growing as a teenager and my face becoming more and more masculine was a absolute hell to deal with. I had a father that never listened to me and just told me to ""grow up and be a man"", that was the last thing in my mind I wanted to do. So for years and years I did what society expected me to do, play sports, join the military, get married and have a family. Guess what, none of that made me feel any better. I still hated who I was on the outside, I hated the refection in the mirror.

For decades I have dealt with thoughts of ending everything but I have always stopped because I had a family and later I had a son and I didn't want to hurt him. It wasn't till I was 48 and I was sitting in my room looking down a barrel of a gun that I finally gained enough strength to reach out for help. I searched and found a therapist and psychologist to help me understand why I felt the way I did. After a long time of speaking with them, they came to the conclusion that I was suffering with gender dysphoria. My therapist brought me to her office one day. In her office is a large coffee table. On this day the table was covered in all of her notes from my sessions with her. She asked me to start reading all the notes on the table, so I did. It took me awhile to read all the notes. Once I had finished reading I sat back in the chair I was sitting in. She looked at me and said one thing to me "" What do you see in all the notes?"" I sat there for a few minutes and I said ""I'm a woman."" and started to cry. She consoled me and said that over the last couple months that she had come to the same conclusion and had to find a way for me to see it for myself without someone directly telling me who I was. I told myself in that office, on that day, who I really was.

So to all the men out there who look at trans women as simply object for you to use, I find it to be disgusting. I am a human being who has had to come to terms with who they are at their core. Give us the respect that we deserve. I don't understand why you feel that way and probably never will.

To all the women, who see trans women as some monster coming to hurt you. That is the last thing I want to do. I want to help and be helped. I never was allowed to grow up as little girl with a mother to show me and help me with everything. I'm having to figure everything out on my own. I do have some female friends who have helped over the years and I will be forever grateful to them.

To the politicians that are here, I know you are here I've seen a few of you. Why did you decide to turn the spotlight onto such a small part of the the population? We are less than 1.5% of the population of the United States. We never did anything to hurt anyone. Yet there are hyperbolic stories made about us. Someone like me who has been on HRT for years has no advantage in sports whatsoever, if anything we are at a disadvantage in sport due to the loss of muscle mass. Did you simply do do this for political votes? There are so many different things that could have been your focus instead of us.

In the end I will probably never know WHY people hate and fear trans people. We are simply people born differently than everyone else. We never asked to be this way. We had to take steps to help ourselves, so we could simply survive. If you lack the empathy to understand this I feel sorry for you.

So as a final thought here for you is this, WHY DO YOU FEEL THE WAY YO DO TOWARDS TRANS PEOPLE? Please take a had long look as to the reason why",1,1743790099.0,trans,1,1.0,False

1jrifd9,https://i.redd.it/bls3lcfdyuse1.jpeg,Carnival Spirit Review: Barcelona to Miami (March 2025),"My wife and I were offered a free two-week cruise on the Carnival Spirit, cruising from Barcelona, Spain to Miami, Florida with stops in Malaga, Cadiz, the Azores Islands, and Bermuda. To keep things relatively brief I'll try to just hit the highlights and lowlights but if you have any questions or would like more details on anything, please let me know!

On our last Carnival cruise we earned a couple thousand points in the casino mostly by winning money and then giving it right back to them. Based on that behavior we received several offers for free cruises, including this one. I guess the Spirit was in dry dock for 45 days in Barcelona and our cruise was the first voyage back to Miami. Our offer included free drinks, but only while in the casino. More on that later.

While I have no way to verify numbers, the ship seemed relatively empty. Every time we went to the buffet there were available tables everywhere. We got a seat in Serenity every time we went. There were always seats available in the casino. That part of the cruise was nice.

OUR ROOM

Our free offer was for an inside room and we paid to update to a balcony room (6th floor, right next to the elevator). For being in dry dock for 45 days, we discovered MANY issues with our room. First, neither of our sliding closet doors latched. We put in a request to get them fixed (it just required a screwdriver, which I didn't have) and it took two days but it was fixed. The problem was, none of our neighbors seemed to get theirs fixed and so every time the boat rocked to one side or the other could hear all the doors sliiiiide open and closed. Our bed mattress deflated every night and a coupe of our overhead LED lights flickered like strobe lights. We requested to get the lights fixed but it never happened so we just used other lights. 

One thing that has changed is that I brought my CPAP with me which, in the past, nobody seemed to notice or care. This time I got a phone call asking me if I had one (I don't even know how they knew) and then they delivered a heavy duty power strip with a super long cord that reached all the way across the room. So that was new (to me) and a nice touch. 

We paid for the best internet and like always it was just good enough for me not to demand a refund. Maybe because we were near the elevator, but I could not get WiFi access from the desk area. From the seat/couch I could get okay signal, from the bed it was hit or miss, and from the desk and balcony (as usual) I could not see the WiFi. It worked fine in the open public areas. 

Halfway through our cruise, the clean water purification ship broke for the entire ship. Carnival offered every passenger one of those gigantic bottles of water for free (pick up at any bar). The system was fixed within a few hours.

CASINO AND DRINKS

The casino is one of the things that was updated while in dry dock. We really liked the layout. The touch pads on many of the machines in high traffic areas were difficult to work, but the ones on inside walls and such worked great. Nothing was broken broken.

We were excited to receive a free drink package for drinks in the casino... and then we learned they've removed the bar in the casino. To get drinks we had to wait on servers to come by. During slow times there might only be one server on the floor and getting a drink was impossible. During busier times there were multiple servers but they were all busy and so getting service was hit or miss. We found ourselves constantly frustrated and I told me wife that each ""free"" drink was costing me $50. I ordered an Irish coffee one day and was told the server would have to go to one area to get coffee and another bar to get alcohol and basically he talked me out of it. When the system worked it worked, but I don't think there would be enough hours in the day to get anywhere near that 15 drink maximum (not that that was our goal or anything). 

WATER, WATER, EVERYWHERE AND OFF LIMITS

By the time we left Spain, the captain announced that we were heading into choppy waters. Pretty much all the open areas of the ship were shut down (all the pods in Serenity were off limits, for example). Because of all the rocking, all the pools were closed for the majority of the cruise (water was sloshing and splashing constantly). At one point the hot tubs were reopened but the one in Serenity was broken most of the cruise. My wife and I spent a lot of time hanging out at the tables back there and watched day after day as maintenance workers scratched their heads in an attempt to get the tub working. We saw people in it a few times, but it was off limits for most of the cruise.

I don't think the water slide was ever open, and if you want to see what bored and lonely look like, we saw several life guards walking around pools that were never open. So sad.

ENTERTAINMENT

We saw five different comedians perform on the ship. I'm not here to bash specific performers but on a scale of 1-10 I would say the best one we saw was a 6 and every other one was a 4 or less. We saw a couple of the performers twice and almost all of them repeated material. I'm a pretty hard guy to offend I will laugh at just about anything but a lot of the material was about how bad buffet food is, how crazy it is that kids have cellphones today (is is 2010?) and how great it is to be cruising after COVID (it's been a few years now). One of the performers played a country song talking about how he accidentally picked up a transgender guy at a bar and I saw a few people walk out. Another guy did a long, long bit about black stereotypes. Again, I wasn't offended by any of it but I just wasn't laughing and neither was anyone else.

There was supposed to be a juggler performing on the ship but because the boat was rocking so hard that people were having a hard time standing, he did not perform.

We attended the Epic Rock show and thought it was fantastic. A solid hour of classic rock with stellar performances. Tons of lasers and lights and pyrotechnics (on a ship!). Top notch.

Of course they had all the traditional trivia and exercise classes and dance lessons. I won one of the 80s trivia contests but I literally run blogs dedicated to 80s nostalgia so it was a bit like shooting fish in a barrel.

Our favorite performer on the ship was a man named Tim Tamashiro, who offered various presentations on photography skills, his time as a monk, a guided meditation session, and a few others. Tim's presentations were a delight to attend and a highlight of our day.

FOOD

Not too much to say. The Iguana Burritos were great for breakfast and the sushi restaurant is always a highlight. The buffet was the buffet. The only truly bad food experience we had was at Guy Fieri's Burger Shack. My wife and I ordered hamburgers and the meat had large chunks of inedible gristle throughout them. It was probably a one-time deal, but they were inedible in the true definition. We had the Chinese food on the buffet one day and it was really good.

EMBARKING AND DISEMBARKING

We chose the latest embarking time (3PM I think) and it may be the smoothest embark we've ever done. We walked right onto the ship when called, no lines, and that was that. Disembarking was just as smooth. We self-disembarked and were ready for all the pushing and shoving and running and... it never happened. 

PORTS AND EXCURSIONS

Cadiz / Tio Pepe: In Cadiz we took a bus tour through town and then went to the Tio Pepe Bodega for a tour and wine tasting. We enjoyed everything about the bus ride, the tour, and the wine tasting. 

Azores Islands: We took a bus to tour the islands, see the Blue Lake and Green Lake, and then walk around a small town area. It was low impact and not super exciting but very beautiful to see.

Bermuda: We did a boat tour of Rich and Famous Homes. Most of the homes belong to people in Bermuda we had never heard of, but it was fun nonetheless. They serve drinks on the tour (cash or card) and our tour guide is also a local music director and the captain was a singer so we got lots of free entertainment and some local knowledge, too. After the tour we were able to explore the area for several more hours before the ship left and so we ate at a local restaurant, did some shopping, and visited the official northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle. We felt safe the entire time -- very nice area to explore.

Malaga: We took a bus tour of the area with a planned one hour time to explore downtown. The tour went completely off the rails as people wandered away from the group, people split off, the tour guide lost people and later his cool. I can't blame the company or excursion on what happened but things were so bad it was comical. At the agreed upon meeting time we were supposed to have 42 people and we only had like 28. Some wandered off to find the bus on their own and my wife was actually double checking her phone just to make sure Uber could get us to this ship in case we got ditched. Somehow they were able to find everybody (I think) and get us back, but it was pretty sketchy. 

OVERALL

The Carnival Spirit is a relatively small ship, especially for a 14 day cruise. Toward the end of the cruise people were experiencing Sea Madness, but we made it and in a year or two we'll all be back.

I wanted to know from your point of view, I always saw people saying that they intend to use it and others that they would relax.  
  
I'll be honest, I'd like to use it a lot less. In environments like public transport, hospitals and some very crowded environments I will continue to use it, but I would definitely like to live a ""normal"" youth, like going to parties, going to restaurants and bars, flirting with someone with my smile, going on cute dates in coffee shops. I don't know, it's sad that this was taken away from us, and I'm sorry for those who have conditions that don't even allow them to get out of bed. I hope in the future HIV-like retrovirals, mucous membrane vaccines, greater ventilation and clean air.

I've seen people comparing it to seat belts and condoms, which I understand, after all they are all prevention tools. But the belt and the condom do not require so much individual sacrifice, you can have a ""normal"" life and use these two. Just, the isolately catches a lot, you know? Again I am sorry to those who have disabilities or are immunocompromised, I know that I have a huge privilege, but I saw that the nasal vaccine is scheduled to launch in 2025. Having a date, even if not so concrete, makes me relieved. Maybe I haven't accepted the state of grief, but I don't know if I can do what I do forever. I know I'm a very short-sighted person, but ""forever"" is too long. I don't want to think that I will be isolated from society, again, I am sorry for those who are. I just don't know, maybe I'm too privileged and I don't know how to deal with issues that some people deal with since they were born. I'm really sorry, I know that no one deserves loneliness.",1,1743789869.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,2,0.55,False

Every time it feels like I'm doing something ""smart"", it fails.

I had an external harddrive fail.

Couldn't remember what exactly I had on it, I just found out by what what was missing when I opened my cloud service and searched for the pics I needed.

My first child's first year of pictures.  Gone.  All of them.

The recovery team/company said I had platter damage, didn't charge me for it, got the hard drive back.  I'm probably going to ask another company for help, see what can be done.

The first year of pics that I had meticulously culled from my other pics on my internal to save to the external because they were so precious and they are all gone.  I was going to make a coffee table book.

I'm always late in doing things, so I thought I was ahead this time.  Get those pics saved so I can do the project later even if my internal harddrive fails (like I've had happen before).

AARrrrrrgh!

I have asked family and friends for their pics in hopes to save a few good ones.  I'm just so sad and angry.

Amex Killer credit card.","Hi all,

Yonder is a lifestyle credit card which provides points to spend on ‚Äòexperiences‚Äô such as restaurant meals, flights, hotels, coffee, beer at pubs, flowers, delivery food services, trips away (such as log cabins and Wellness retreats) and much more -**it changes every month**!

If you sign up via my referral link (here:¬†[https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)) you will get 10,000 points (worth approximately¬†**¬£50 in credit**¬†towards various experiences, dependent on experience chosen, in cities of London, Manchester, Birmingham Bristol and Bath, or towards the¬†**online experiences**¬†such as flights, food deliveries, flower deliveries etc - therefore can be used in any city, no matter where you live!).

Some good examples of redemptions I've personally used / I am planning on:

* Fancy massage parlour
* Various restaurants for lunches and dinner
* Ocean Bottle (akin to Chilly's) as a gift
* Freddie's Flowers

On top of this, some other perks of the card and referral include:

* you will be able to claim 3 months¬†*premium*¬†membership for¬†**free**¬†which provides¬†**worldwide family travel insurance**¬†when booking travel on the card and also 5 points per ¬£1 spent.
* From my rough calculations, this correlates to somewhere in the region of 2 to 3% cash back dependent on the experience
* You‚Äôll also be able to get Mastercard foreign exchange fees (i.e essentially the best fees you can get when abroad, akin to cards like Chase/Monzo/Revolut) and purchase protection, which is a¬†**huge perk**¬†and means you can get 2-3% cash back on¬†**holiday spends**!

To sign up, you can go through the referral link (or any referral link!) and follow the steps.

**Application Process**¬†(Including Hard Credit Check)

1. Download Yonder App using the¬†[referral link](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)
2. Verify Your Email & Details: Provide accurate information for verification.
3. Give some initial info and it performs a soft credit check to determine if you are eligible. If not, it will say so, so no need for a hard check.
4. Link Your Main Bank Accounts: This step ensures Yonder can offer you an appropriate credit limit.
5. Complete Identity Check: Take a quick selfie and provide a valid government-issued ID.
6. Undergo a Hard Credit Check: As with any credit card application, a hard check will be performed on your credit report.
7. Done

You can also cancel before the 3 months premium ends to avoid the subscription renewing and once you‚Äôve spent all the points on experiences, and switch to a free card or just cancel the card.

On the whole I‚Äôm really enjoying Yonder and hope you will too! I‚Äôm enjoying so much so that I‚Äôm I've continued using the subscription after my first 3 months premium free (and I also use it on top of my AMEX). The nice thing is it tends to be¬†**accepted everywhere**¬†that AMEX is not (because it's Mastercard) and you can spend abroad without a transaction fee.

It's a brand new coffee shop (no alcohol served) that is open in the mornings Sun-Thurs (till 3) and morning and evening Friday/Saturday till 9pm.  If you remember the old Joe Beans it has that vibe - friendly coffee place, with a nice stage setup for performances and a cozy atmosphere. It does not have a ""coffee bar"" area, instead a counter service and lots of seating at tables, with a central stage.

The owner (Elvio Fernandez) is the drummer for Daughtry and his partners are friends through music.  Elvio also owns a music education organization called Rockstar Academy - and envisions this as a potential performance space for students getting their start on weekend evenings.

The coffee is roasted by Wade Reed (roaster for AM/FM Coffee downtown and roaster at Aporia Coffee - formerly roaster for Joe Beans and Fifth Frame downtown.   They offer a number of interesting lattes and variants, have sandwiches and bagels, some pretty delicious baked goods and smoothies and tea for the non-coffee folk.  I had a nice espresso and the pull was a good one and they offered either dark or medium roast - unusual for an espresso joint. They also had drip, lattes, and various types of specialty milk and milk alternative drinks.

It's great to see a new coffee shop that is open in the evening and will feature some entertainment. I'm not much of one for bars or beer places and miss the Joe Bean Vibe.  I still get my bag coffee for home from them and AM/FM - Aporia. The staff seemed friendly and helpful, though as with any opening day they were still ironing out some of the kitchen workflow, and knowledge base about coffee. Opening day was a family affair - lots of parents, grandparents and relatives and other associated folk with a smattering of Daughtry fans.  I am looking forward to visiting again.

One accessibility note. The ordering area is ""behind the stage"" so to speak which occupies the center of the seating area and there is a small easy to navigate step up to the stage area to get to it with no ramp.  If you are wheelchair bound you may need assistance with that, and even if you're not you should BE AWARE and be careful not to trip. It's just one step but..... The bathrooms and entry are both wheelchair accessible.

There is plenty of free parking, and it looks like it could seat around 20 comfortably with a combination of tables and booths.  To the best of my knowledge this is counter service only - no wait staff.",2,1743789287.0,Rochester,1,1.0,False

Today we spent the morning together and I let him relax with no bandages or anything on his foot. It was dried out nicely and scabbing. I rewrapped it with gauze and tape, and left for 25 minutes to visit the very nearby local book store/coffee show. When I got home he had torn off the gauze and tape and the foot was dripping blood.

In the 2/3 ep she had already guessed that Maryrose was Robe-same, that Christopher was dead and that Rosemary purposely ate an Ember. 

She got some theories wrong but got most of them right.

I remember watching it and finding out who Robe-same was in chapter 56 or 60, which I think are equivalent to ep 6 or 7. And I only thought that Christopher was dead in ep 9 (I had forgotten he existed) 

And I never thought about the sugar cubes. So my point is, the anime made it so obvious who Robe-same was, either I'm just a bit slow or this girl is very good with theories (I think it's the last option, I personally don't think I'm that slow)

Without thinking, he poured his bottle, his only source of water, over his head.

‚Äò‚ÄôGood for you, I don‚Äôt know how to stop talking.‚Äô‚Äô Sam sipped some coffee. Though he was staring at his cup, his thoughts were focused on the tremors in the earth. He sensed the footsteps of the patrons, a strange whirring sensation, but he also felt something heavier approaching. Each step accompanied by a thud. Many lighter steps followed. People were running. Screams.

Looking up from his coffee, Sam saw a crowd, chased by a mechanical bull, hastily running down the street. The large monster, undoubtedly the Colchis Bull, smashed anything in its path to the side. A red Volkswagen exploded, causing even more panic among the people of Washington.

‚Äò‚ÄôBig truck,‚Äô‚Äô mumbled the barista, voice drifting off. ‚Äò‚ÄôHey French dude, we should hide‚Ä¶ dude?‚Äô‚Äô

The ‚ÄòFrench dude‚Äô had already bolted, to do what he did best: being an idiot.

‚Äò‚ÄôHEY!‚Äô‚Äô shouted Sam, appearing behind the bull. ‚Äò‚ÄôYou‚Äôre an ugly bull! I bet someone with no hands made you, that‚Äôs why you are so ugly! And you stink too!‚Äô‚Äô

It wasn‚Äôt Sam‚Äôs best work, but his insults had their desired effect. Steam erupted out of the bull‚Äôs nose. Its bronze muscles tightened, and a murderous gleam focused on the son of Poseidon. The bull bellowed and charged.

Sam ran as fast as his short legs allowed him to, his awareness of the earth allowing him to have a vague idea of how close the Colchis Bull was to turning him into mush. There was still enough distance between them for Sam to come up with a plan. Unfortunately for him, every plan he could think of involved a painful death. Sam dove behind a transformer box, the bull charging past him.

He rummaged through his bag, looking for anything that could be of use. A soccer ball? No, not unless the bull wanted to play petit pont-baston with him. A bag of Sour Patch Kids? Delicious, but useless. His hydroflask and the shield Sebastian had forged him? Now we were talking!¬†

Sam attached the flask to his belt, transformed his watch into his spear, and slung his backpack over his shoulders. Kicking up, catching, and equipping the shield, he was ready to fight.

As the bull circled back to charge him again, Sam made a run for it. There was a nice, quaint - soon to be not so nice and not so quaint - park just around the corner from where he was. If he could make it there without getting pinned by the monster‚Ä¶ Yeah, that sounded like a terrific plan.

Though Sam ran as fast as he could, he felt the fiery breath of the bull on his neck, and right as he arrived at the park entrance, a loose paving slab caused Sam to trip. He shielded his face and rolled away to narrowly avoid being stepped on. Too close, way too close. Standing back up, he chased the bull into the park.

The Colchis Bull came to a standstill on a grassy field surrounded by blossoming trees. It sniffed the air, bellowing as it locked eyes with the son of Poseidon, who was nursing a bloody nose.

‚Äò‚ÄôFucking bull.‚Äô‚Äô Sam groaned after arriving on the scene and glaring at the bull. That thing‚Äôs charge was deadly: he needed to do something about it. As he felt the shield in his left hand, Sam got a dumb idea. As the bull began to wind up its charge, dragging its feet across the grass, Sam would throw the shield at the bull‚Äôs legs. Like he was Captain America.

Stupidly enough, the plan worked and the bull was knocked out of balance. Sam saw his chance, grabbed kataig√≠da with both hands, and ran at the bull, intending to stab its eyes out. He closed in on the monster, almost there‚Ä¶ Stupidly enough, Sam forgot there was more to bulls than the ability to charge.¬†

They had horns too.

Too late Sam noticed the incoming headbutt. The bull‚Äôs head hit him full force, sending him flying into a tree. CRACK! Sam felt something break, but he was not sure what. The world spun and it wouldn‚Äôt stop, nausea took hold of him and his head pounded like a marching band. Sam‚Äôs breathing grew irregular and he felt the uneasy heat he felt when he got angry. He had really pretended he could fix this with a plan, he really thought he could act chill.

As he struggled back to his feet, Sam saw how the bull charged to finish the job. How about no? He took a stand, feet solid on the ground. Beneath him, the earth roared and as the monster came close, Sam raised his fist in the air: ‚Äò‚ÄôFuck off!‚Äô‚Äô he yelled. As he pumped his fist, a rock suddenly erected from the ground, slicing the bull‚Äôs head open.¬†¬†

Where did that thing come from..?

Sam didn‚Äôt have time to question how, why or what as the Colchis Bull‚Äôs mouth started glowing an orangish red and soon erupted with flame, the bull spitting an inferno at the son of Poseidon.

***

Behind Sam, the rock shattered into many pieces. The bull‚Äôs crash had bought Sam some time to properly run away this time and actually come up with a plan for once. He booked it out of the park, onto the Washington streets once more. He wouldn‚Äôt be able to use his surroundings here, but it was either that or risking that the bull set the park on fire. An easily made choice.

As Sam ran, he could hear the monster bellow in the distance. Each time Sam‚Äôs sneakers hit a drain cover, he could feel the water underneath them. Water he could use. He got another risky idea.

Sam stopped running, placing his foot on the drain cover. He tensed his muscles, taking hold of the water with his thoughts and starting to manipulate the pressure in the water. In the distance the bull appeared, running fast at the son of Poseidon. A couple seconds more‚Ä¶¬†

Five‚Ä¶ four‚Ä¶ three‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ one..!¬†

Sam removed his feet from the drain cover, diving backward as the cover was blasted into the sky. It promptly hit the Colchis Bull‚Äôs head, blasting it off. The street overflowed with water. The robot struggled, letting out a dying sound as it collapsed. ‚Äò‚ÄôTold you,‚Äô‚Äô Sam said with a yawn. ‚Äò‚ÄôJust fuck off.‚Äô‚Äô¬†¬†

The son of Poseidon then returned to Argus with the question of whether he could load the celestial bronze bull onto the camp bus. What a day.

1jrhwxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1jrhwxl/need_your_advice_with_adhd_and_95/,Need your advice with ADHD and 9-5,"Hi everyone, I'm really sorry if this post becomes long. English is not my first language, and I'm using AI to help refine my thoughts. But everything I‚Äôm about to share is true, and I really need your advice based on your experience.

I'm 28M and work in the creative field‚Äîmostly graphic design and video editing. I‚Äôm confident in my creativity, but when it comes to academics and structure, I‚Äôve always struggled. In school, I was consistently underperforming, and I only passed major exams by hyperfocusing in the last week using pattern recognition and shortcuts.

Later, I went abroad for higher studies and completed both my bachelor's and master's. Looking back, I realize that I got through by procrastinating and pulling intense all-nighters. For example, sometimes I stayed up for 33‚Äì34 hours to complete work just before deadlines. This became a pattern, especially during my master‚Äôs thesis. I did it in about 5‚Äì6 days under immense stress. My professor even thought I‚Äôd fail, but I somehow pulled it off. Even though I succeeded, I always felt like something was wrong with me for not being able to start earlier. That‚Äôs when I came across ADHD and started to see how well it matched my experiences.

After returning to my home country, I started working remotely‚Äîmostly freelancing and doing short-term projects. Working from home actually suited me because I could stay up at night and sleep during the day. This was already my natural routine, and I was used to relying on energy drinks to hyperfocus whenever I needed to finish something. I knew it wasn‚Äôt healthy, but it helped me ‚Äúclick into‚Äù work mode.

Eventually, I decided to see a psychiatrist. I explained my experience, and after listening for just 5‚Äì6 minutes, she said I likely had ADHD. She asked me if I wanted medication. I was unsure, but curious‚Äîespecially after reading about how helpful ADHD meds could be. I was worried about side effects, but the doctor said it would be fine at my age and prescribed me 5mg of Ritalin, with instructions to take it only on important workdays (one dose in the morning, one in the afternoon).

At the time, I had no fixed routine and was still working from home. I took the medication on random days when I needed to work‚Äîand surprisingly, it helped me focus. But over time, I noticed I was becoming agitated and angry more easily. It felt like my mood was off. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was because of the medication, but I assumed it was. That‚Äôs when I started reducing how often I took it. Eventually, I stopped completely. I still had some pills left, and I started using them like I used to use energy drinks‚Äîjust when I needed to power through a task. After that, I went back to using energy drinks instead of the meds because they felt safer and more familiar. Plus, they tasted better.

But I never went back to the psychiatrist. I kept putting it off. My work was still inconsistent, and I didn‚Äôt have a structured routine, so I managed things the same way I always had: waiting until the last minute, then relying on coffee, energy drinks and hyperfocus.

Fast forward to now‚ÄîI recently got hired by a well-known advertising agency. It's a huge milestone for me. But the challenge is: it‚Äôs a 9-to-5, five-days-a-week job. The work is fun and creative, and I genuinely like the environment. But I‚Äôm starting to fall back into my old patterns. Some days, I don‚Äôt feel like working at the office and tell myself I‚Äôll do it later at home‚Äîwhich ends up with me staying up all night again and going to work without sleep.

There are also many meetings, a lot of documentation, and so much information shared that I sometimes can‚Äôt process everything quickly. I enjoy being involved, but I often forget what was said in the last meeting or struggle to respond quickly when asked questions. I feel like my brain can‚Äôt keep up like others do.

So here‚Äôs where I need your advice:

Should I go back to medication or not? Do I really need it? I afraid that both of them is unhealthy for me, maybe I'm wrong.

Part of me feels like I was wrong to stop. Maybe meds could help me be more consistent and organized. But I also have concerns. I‚Äôm afraid of getting dependent or addicted, especially since I‚Äôve had a habit of abusing things like weed occasionally when ever I had access in general, and energy drinks or in this case meds when I feel they help me perform better. I'm also scared about long-term health effects, especially if the dosage increases over time and will get dependant on it. All the side effects that can be. And honestly, I don‚Äôt even know if I ever used the medication the right way.

At the same time, I feel like if I don‚Äôt take medication, I can survive‚Äîbut it‚Äôll always be through stress, exhaustion, and very unorganized manner. I might never reach 100% of my potential.

So what do you all think? Is it worth trying medication again, this time with better structure and guidance? Or should I stick to my old coping mechanisms‚Äîeven if they‚Äôre not healthy‚Äîand just find other non-medication strategies to manage ADHD? Is it even possible?

Thanks for taking time to read this. I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts.

The oxen didn‚Äôt speak.

Not in words. Not aloud. But they *communicated*, in the way ancient trees lean toward sunlight, or wolves coordinate their hunt with glances and breath.

On the third night past the border, as the caravan moved through pine-covered hills, the snow began to fall heavier ‚Äî slow at first, then in sheets that swallowed their lantern light. Featherstone warned them to make camp early, despite Mouse‚Äôs instinct to press on.

‚ÄúThere's a change in the air,‚Äù the old owl murmured, his feathers ruffling under his cloak. ‚ÄúA flavor I haven‚Äôt tasted since Prague. Old-world hexwork. Salt won't help you here.‚Äù

They pitched tents near a frozen river, the water silent beneath the ice. Minx kept first watch, sipping thick coffee and sketching the oxen by firelight. She noticed the larger one ‚Äî the bull ‚Äî standing perfectly still, nose pointed toward the woods. Not sleeping. Not blinking.

When Blue Puppy joined her, he frowned at the drawing. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs the bull got markings like that? Those aren‚Äôt spots.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù Minx replied. ‚ÄúThey're brands. Old ones. Like sigils.‚Äù

Featherstone stirred awake. He spoke without opening his eyes.

‚ÄúIn the Black Forest, there are creatures called *Waldhexe* ‚Äî forest witches. They curse not with death, but with legacy. Make things grow in unnatural ways. Make *descendants* carry the punishment. You think you're free of it, but then your child is born... taller than a barn, and cursed to outlive mountains.‚Äù

Blue Puppy shivered. ‚ÄúThat's oddly specific.‚Äù

Featherstone cracked an eye. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always oddly specific.‚Äù

That night, the snow hissed as it touched the ground.

Mouse, meanwhile, dreamt of the past ‚Äî though he had no memory of living it.

In his vision, the two oxen were tethered in a stone stable, surrounded by torchlight and a crowd chanting in an archaic dialect. A figure in a tattered red cloak dipped a branch into a basin of black sap and marked their foreheads. A language unspoken in a thousand years burned through the air:

> *‚ÄúLet your line be known to all seasons ‚Äî  
> Let it grow, and grow, and grow ‚Äî  
> until no shelter holds it,  
> no master names it.‚Äù*

Mouse awoke with a gasp. The fire had gone out. The oxen were still.

But just beyond the trees, the snow whispered in a tongue no one had taught him.

It is quite possibly the worst breakup of my life....and I have been in a really bad place.  My therapist has recently concluded that I suffered from what used to be referred to as a ""nervous breakdown"" starting in November.  My mental health was in a severely bad place, and my relationship issues drove it to a full-on breakdown that I didn't even recognize until she clarified this. 

left my job in August - which is really what started things in the bad direction.  It was painful for me because of the situation - my boss (attorney) lied to save himself from a department head's anger over our changed approval of a catalog cover (we revoked the approval due to a potential infringement issue).  He's such a p#ssy that he instead threw his paralegal under the bus to save himself from some sharp words.  Anyway, I had proof of his involvement and thus dishonesty, and requested separation.  The General Counsel agreed because ""once trust is lost....there's no getting it back"" - so I got a good severance package and I felt pretty good about it.  I really did not think I would have a hard time finding a job, so I set out to take a break with my severance, and get a remote job.  So I didn't start looking until October, and most hiring gets frozen in the last quarter - so that was dumb on my part to not think ahead.  Regardless, I went into a full-on panic tailspin.

  
I sold my duplex and moved into my boyfriend's house - at the time his son (M25) and his girlfriend (F22) were living there, and his teenager would come a week at a time....so that was difficult for me being an empty nester for 10 years.  His teen was not awesome to deal with - so I laid down the boundaries that I would take no part in parenting, but I would of course take care in other ways (cooking, rides, etc).  As time went on, he and his ex broke down that boundary because my ex did NO parenting whatsoever and the kid knew he would come to that house for a week and have no parenting.  That took its toll on me - he treated the house like a hotel, me like the staff, and threw clean loads of laundry on the floor when he wanted to do his own.  After a few years of my ex not addressing these issues, resentment built.

My ex is also the neediest man I have ever known.  He does nothing for himself and after a few years of this, I was somehow turned into his personal staff.  I get up early, so I would get up and take care of things that nobody else did...and made coffee.  Then I brought him his coffee every damn day...among other things.  I literally did everything for him.  I bought him all new clothes, re-furnished the house so it could feel like home to me too...and when I hit my mental health crisis, he was NOT there for me.  Instead, he would say things like ""Your problems are not my fault"" and left me feeling abandoned and uncared for.  When I went with him to Vegas in November, I hit a low when he spent no time with me there...and found myself sobbing in the middle of the Venetian the night before we left.  Then Christmas came and went...and when I did not get the job I was interviewing for and thought I had in the bag (January), I went off the deep end when he didn't even ask me about it.  

I left him on Valentines day.  First I moved into another room, and when he was doing nothing to resolve and continued to proclaim his innocence in any wrongdoing, I had to leave.  I was having panic attacks, insomnia, could no longer eat, and when I overheard him on speaker phone talking to his 25 year old daughter about my mental health (and they were both low-key laughing about it), I had to leave him completely.  I had nowhere to go - so I had to stay with friends and then my father over the next month.  I still had hope that he would do something to show me he loved me...but that never came.  The relationship is over - mostly because my red line was him involving his adult children in our relationship issues....and he refused to stop.  

We have finally now gotten to a point of being able to text again - but only about logistics, splitting assets, etc.  We do not speak.  I told him in a text about my mental breakdown diagnosis and he ""read"" it, but no response.  If that's not the cherry on the sundae...I don't know what is. :(

I am in week 3 of my new job and apartment hunting while I stay in a room at my friend's house.  My life sucks so bad. ",1,1743788147.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False

I‚Äôm looking for a platonic long term friend (age 30-116, Google says there‚Äôs a gal named Inah who is 116) who likes to chat or email (maybe exchange letters or do phone calls once in a while).

All of these options apply to me: I‚Äôm 37, F, married, have small kids, smaller dogs, talk too much, similarly write too much, but if you need to vent I can listen.

I run on coffee, I run in the street for exercise, I run from social gatherings. I tend to write with horrible grammar. Not bragging about it. I write for a living, but do technical writing and my brain switches off after work in needing to be coherent.

I love music, reading, movies, television, travel, wine, beer, most sports, most spirits, the paranormal or the liquoral, no it‚Äôs not a word but you know what I mean, games (again literal ones not the mind game ones). I mostly do mobile games, board games and some RPGs. Fandoms, too many to list. I of course like knitting and run on sentences.

I‚Äôd ideally like someone who prefers to chat daily, share pics of your projects, coffee, nice birds, yeah I was serious about the boring part, have started birdwatching. 

But also if you have a variable schedule where you might be out of pocket for a day, or days, that‚Äôs also me. 

Also enjoy talking about politics, law, science, morality and the unknown, like aliens or the paranormal. I also can get down with reality TV, so I‚Äôm super complex (is a joke the complex part I do like reality TV).

I‚Äôd love to hear about you as I know I spent way too much space writing about me, but I enjoy folks who similarly write a lot. Who wants to be friends folks (and develop mild arthritis together from typing too much here and at work)?",4,1743788084.0,MakeFriendsOver30,3,1.0,False

1jrhojo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/1jrhojo/colposcopy_story_for_anyone_with_anxiety/,"Colposcopy story, for anyone with anxiety","Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm 29F who had a routine Pap smear that came back as LSIL. This was my first abnormal pap after having my first one at 25 that came back normal. My doctor suggested I get a colposcopy bc in my age range that is the next step for an LSIL Pap. I just want to preface this by saying I know that colposcopies are different for everyone. Just like a pap is, some people find them to be really painful and some don‚Äôt really mind it at all. It is entirely subjective that varies person to person, we‚Äôre all different. However I‚Äôd like to share my experience in hopes it will help someone as I was very freaked out and felt very scared of this whole process and knew no one who has had this done so I was in the dark figuring it out on my own. The colposcopy itself is literally just like a step up from pap, it‚Äôs essentially the same tools, just using magnifying glass and some other tools to take samples from your cervix. If you have a biopsy taken, it can be a little uncomfortable but for me I literally felt absolutely nothing. Idk if it‚Äôs bc she had me cough while she was doing it or if I‚Äôm just one of those who doesn‚Äôt feel as much pain down there. She took two biopsies back to back and didn‚Äôt feel them at all. The ECC to me is the most uncomfortable part bc it‚Äôs literally exactly like someone is pushing a long tool up to the top of your cervix and slowly pulling it out, doesn‚Äôt really hurt just feels super weird and uncomfortable. After a while bc it‚Äôs longer than a pap, for me my vaginal walls kinda started getting sore from being held open for so long but not that bad, some cramping during the ECC but nothing crazy or even super noticeable. And that‚Äôs it, last maybe 10 minutes. However that varies depending on how many biopsies they need to take. A lot of people bleed after, which my OBGYN told me is totally normal, however for some reason I didn‚Äôt really bleed. Also super normal to have weird brown or coffee ground like discharge, just from the silver nitrate they use to stop any bleeding.
Now for me, the scary part was waiting for the results. My doctor was kind of elusive about if she saw anything and basically told me she didn‚Äôt but couldn‚Äôt guarantee anything until biopsy bc they really can‚Äôt say what degree of dysplasia there could be just by looking at it. My results came back in 3 days and they came back as benign, with some metaplasia (which I think is like inflammation) but benign. My doc said she will see me in a year to follow up and see what it looks like and then we will test for HPV. She also said she noticed a lot more paps are coming back as abnormal despite people testing negative for HPV, which said could be attributed to some labs being more sensitive and cautious with their results. I wanted to make this post to say if you are freaked out by your abnormal pap like I was, literally having the most anxiety and reading every reddit post/website you can find about it, try to calm down even tho it‚Äôs easier said than done. If you are keeping up with your paps, and your doctors aren‚Äôt overly concerned, then you should take that for what it is and not turn into something more until you know more. I‚Äôm not saying there isn‚Äôt the 4% of people who do have something 
more sinister going on, and my heart will always go out to them bc that could be any one of us. But your doctors do see these things often enough to know the red flags, and they will guide you to the best resolution. If you feel like your doctor isn‚Äôt doing that or isn‚Äôt addressing any concerns, find someone else!! Not everyone is like that and they should be following the proper follow up protocols bc every OBGYN follows the same protocol when it comes to this for the exact reason of preventing anything scary happening and catching things early. Keep up with your routine pap screening, and you should be just fine. You just have to keep reminding yourself of that! I‚Äôm hoping within the next year any changes I had can clear up and come back normal, but if not then that is why we do these uncomfortable little tests called paps!",2,1743788012.0,HPV,2,1.0,False

1jrho1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/1jrho1g/my_pitch_for_a_antman_4/,My Pitch For a Ant-Man 4,"
The Basis of this pitch is inspired by the theory that Scott is not where he isn‚Äôt meant to be. Kang is a closed chapter but where Scott is / was is still
Ambiguous. I got inspired by the Truman show, inception and the dream walking concept from doctor strange 2. 

Felt that the 4th installment would be perfect if it was set before secret wars as it perfectly sets in so.

I wanted to make it look like Scott was in an another universe where after the events of quantumania the Family gets a change of heart and moral and everyone turns against Scott etc etc. Plot armor is that a nano-virus from the quantum realm affected them except Scott. Which would justify and explain my choice of tone later.

Check it out 

Act 1 : The Cliche Start

Scott Lang is running around the streets of San Francisco with The Beatles‚Äô here comes the sun playing in the background, enjoying his time and everyone around him waving back at him as he is infamous and is regularly active in San Fran like how Spider-Man is in New York. 

He sees a store robbery happen on the way. He grins and then a whole montage of Antman fighting and belittling these robbers is shown and then he gets a free Apple as a gift of appreciation, he is seen walking out to the store to a cafe which seems familiar as the music plays along.
The plan is simple once a week he does a podcast and a vlog it has been 4 weeks since he started so.

He grabs his coffee and donuts from the same guy we saw in quantumania and then he is later showed walking to his house. He enters the hallroom and gazes at the TV covered by a cloth and then greets Hope and Cassie
(who is about to leave for a trip to Pasadena for an ""invite"").

As Cassie leaves Hope asks Scott about his plans for the day after sharing a kiss and asks him about his physiotherapy after exposed to certain levels of radiation through the portal scene in the ending fight of quantumania. 

He replies with a ""yea it‚Äôs alright,it has been working out I guess"" and then he explains his plan for the day which consists of taking down minor minuscule villains who have been popping up in the city and so on. Hope replies with ""someone‚Äôs been watching neighborhood watch"" humorously both laugh.

Hope leaves the premises and Scott waits for her to leave the driveway. The moment that has been done he walks to the hall room and the tone is a little eerie and weird as Scott stares at the TV after he removes the cloth to reveal a huge cracked open hole and then we focus on his fingers which seems scarred from scratching on something sharp. Implying that there is something wrong here.

Scott gets his phone camera out and starts recording himself in a vlog style format.
He starts doing things out of the ordinary which seem odd like exhausting his suit from pym particles in a way it glitches but then it just malfunctions while talking slack to his ""viewers"" just for him to be sent flying towards the wall due the malfunction.

He goes to Hank Pym‚Äôs House for his radiation therapy and Hank asks him how‚Äôs he been since the last visit. He ensures it‚Äôs alright. 
Then he takes his medications and injectables after being scanned.
Janet also talks about how she relates to the exposure of the quantum realm and adjusting to earth again.

He leaves the premises and gets pizza delivered to his home. Comically he records his pizza ""mukbang"" talking about his experience explaining how after a few days after quantumania he had a lot of problems in his body that made him feel as if he was being dragged towards something and something was being dragged towards him before he could form another concerning thought the doorbell rings and it‚Äôs Hope looking worried for a split second but fine very next second.

They both share pizza and finalize discussions about their marriage till they talk themselves to sleep.

Act 2: something‚Äôs wrong 

As he sleeps, Scott enters a dream, He goes to the usual cafe but something is strange, people see him and are terrified and surprised and they start screaming Some even leave and then he rushes outside as he hears screams but no one‚Äôs screaming. Suddenly a whole horde of people are seen running towards him. He starts running away from them as they scream in terror as something vague seems to be in the background. He is almost crushed by the stampede of the crowd but then he is teleported to a corner of an alley as his vision gets blurry and a white clothed and white skinned entity with a pitch deep voice in an English accent says ""where have you been Scott Lang?"" As he is teleported away in pain and agony. He regains his vision and walks past the alley exit but stops just to see a ""Scott Lang missing"" poster which terrifies him. As he tries to touch it a swarm of ants start covering his hand and then his arm like a symbiote and they cover him entirely and then he wakes up.

Scott wakes up terrified, Hope has already woken up. He brushes his teeth and checks the newspaper just to walk up
To the hall and see a perfectly spotless TV. He asks Hope what happened to the TV and ""has it always been like this?"" She humorously denies his claims of the TV being broken and then he shrugs it off as she leaves. The door closes and it all seems fine until he sees his fingers. They are unharmed. No scratches,no scars.

He vigorously starts puking until he finally stops and noticed an ant in the puke and then he feels a sting on his back and he removes his shirt to reveal a minor 3-4 ant bite cluster nothing too gorey just spots.

then the camera focuses on the medication on the table. He only took one of the two pills. He keeps his mouth shut and experiments with the probability of him not taking or taking the pills In a pattern.

He tries calling up Sam Wilson and whichever avenger is available to his service to help him with something but they‚Äôre all busy. 

He goes out and sees a bunch of protestors talk about lies open and truths hidden, they use a slogan called ""show us the real world"" slogan. Scott realized that Luis is also a part of this and he catches up with him and realizes that the last time he didn‚Äôt take his medications he saw them and also the The last time before that. He keeps all this patterns in mind and writes them down and records monologues related to this for his ""viewers"".

He takes the last pill and everything goes normally again. He fights robbers, catches up with friends, does his things etc. 

The routine goes on for A whole week and there‚Äôs no weirdness for a whole week.

Scott goes for one of his last few check ups for the ""radiation"" therapy and Hank gives some specifications bout how the injectables and pills work and help his arm which has been the most affected.

He goes home and checks his piece of technology to assess his condition more precisely as there‚Äôs no major damage. He sees an Ant go inside his monitor but pays no mind. the same routine goes the same but this time he takes neither of the pills nor the injections.

He faints in the middle of the night as he is home alone but instead of ""falling asleep"" he falls into a void looping itself until he genuinely faints. This time he wakes up in a San Francisco that‚Äôs withering and his right arm is slightly withered down. This time he has an Ant-Man suit, he fights a group of rebels who demand for his flesh but he subdued them nevertheless then he sees the rubble of downtown San Fran and skeletons but the moment he turns back he is brought back to the same cafe and he sees a semi burned version of the cafe guy who asks him where has he been and  it‚Äôs been ages Before Scott could ask more he is seen to be floating possessed mid air levitating in pain as a dark Smokey green mist is surrounding him and the guy dies next to him asks him to save him.

We are shown Scott floating mid air in his room as Hope and is seen rushing towards him forcefully injecting the medications and the two pills followed up. He wakes up and confronts Hope asking her if something has been hidden from him all along and the whole arguement turns rash as Scott‚Äòs paranoia shows out even more.

Hope stops reasoning saying ""this could‚Äôve been easier if you didn‚Äôt ask too many questions"" and the next thing shown is hope pushing a button and Scott blacks out.

The entirety of ACT 1 plays again but ACT 2 is as if it‚Äôs looped aswelll but perfectly  altered to the point where it fades to 
"" a loop later "" Cue card.

ACT 3: breakthrough

Scott is seen finalizing dates with Hope and The family in the house with Cassie aswell for his final grand wedding. They get interrupted by the news and they see a crime happening. The Antman and Wasp rush to the scene. 

Scott is seen fighting a copycat version of ghost and a bunch of ""technology stealing bandits"" they‚Äôre taken care of until one of them injects something into scott‚Äôs leg and he starts puking microbots again and then these ""bandits"" look familiar as they are actually the same protestors forgotten about. The last one removes his mask and his disguise and  it‚Äôs revealed that it‚Äôs Luis and he‚Äôs wearing a TVA outfit and he was sent of a mission to retrieve him. As he embraces Scott he is shot from the back and his body slowly falls down to the ground. It is revealed it is Hope who shot him which causes him to scream at her ""why!!!!"" She screams back and asks him to shut up claiming that this all would‚Äôve been easier if he never doubted and she is about to shoot him aswell.

Before she could do anything Hope is seen being shot from the back and instead of blood there‚Äôs electricity and blue blood coming out as she is subdued and another Antman but with a more futuristic suit is seen Scott screams and tries to fight him in confusion but this Antman pleads him to stop and he aswell injects more of that injectable anti-venom like thing and Scott starts puking out microbots that move back and forth again. The other ant man claims ""Scott we must leave now, this place isn‚Äôt what it seems"" as he grabs the tempad and connects it to his apparatus.

He uses the tempad but realizes they need another major pym particle sample to make the jump to safety . Both of them stare at each other Hope brings herself up  
And in a deeper robotized voice she claims ""two birds one stone, now I‚Äôll be needing both of you"" as they see her have the particle they need they have no option but to fight her.

Hank pym and Janet van dyne come out of nowhere in a Yellowjacket suit with Cassie in a version of it aswell followed by a whole swarm of people who were once dead except the ""technology stealing bandits"".

They all swarm them and start fighting them but Janet sides with the two Antmen and she gets killed in the process.

Both are almost beaten to a pulp but they both stop holding back their punches.
the both end up killing all of them now only hope and Hank are alive brought to near death. Scott asks them ""who really are you guys?"" Before Hope answers she malfunctions and bursts into an explosion.

Hank replies in a sinister tone ""you don‚Äôt belong here Scott, but as long as you have it in you, you will never escape from me, from us"" and then he stares at the other ant man and claims ""this one could‚Äôve been more useful if he didn‚Äôt run away from us, too bad you are all we need"" as he grabs and locks his arm to a machine that starts extracting his blood.

The other Antman regains himself and goes micro to stop the motors from working and then he resizes and slashes Scott‚Äôs arm off and kills the evil version of Hank.

Scott is in shock and is in pain but he sees his arm wither and then slowly turn into a ant arm like shape with a metallic color and an injured and reasoned with Cassie is seen ripping the arm in half and using it to start fighting.

The Antman and Scott start walking towards her but she isn‚Äôt gonna listen. The fellow ant man says ""she‚Äôs gone now you‚Äôre better off not knowing who she really is now."" Scott asks him ""how do you know this?"" But the other Antman focuses on the fight instead and they both work on subduing Cassie instead of killing her. After a very vigorous fight. Cassie is defeated but not until she slashes the fellow ant man‚Äôs stomach and he is left bleeding and then something takes control of Scott and he loses his consciousness for a split second just for an electric blue blooded Cassie is shutting down infront of him.

The other Antman says ""it had to be done"" as he drags himself and cries to himself.  The other Scott claims ""this was my universe, I was meant to be here but after quantum realm something changed in all of them their therapy was a lie, it was a conversion.""

Scott grabs him with his only one arm to check on him and asks him how did he find him.

The Antman says ""you puked me out, you couldn‚Äôt see that coming?"" And the gets a flashback of everything he saw an ant around his house and he realizes what broke his loops constantly. 

The Antman mentions the ""vlogs"" in a mocking manner and he realizes who the ""viewer"" really was.

He thanks him and tells him this won‚Äôt be in vain as he cries to himself looking at the devastation and trauma caused at the scene.

The other Antman frankly tells him ""you don‚Äôt belong here, we switched places.
Your universe needs you.
This isn‚Äôt your universe Scott""

Scott is terrified and shocked as he realizes whatever doubt he ever had was right and he has always been right bout it all along and something had been keeping him here all along.

The other ant man says ‚Äúyea about that I sense that something took care of that"" and as he is struggling to gain himself he gives his mechanical arm to him which is shaped like an mechanical ant hand. Scott realizes that his blood isn‚Äôt red it is rather greenish.

He opens his mask just to see an ant‚Äôs face and hey says ""look out for the big guy"" as he laughs and opens a portal/tear in reality for him before the universe collapses. The last thing he tells him is ""I‚Äôve lost my world you still have a time, this is an incursion. Warn them of this. Warn them of everything that will happen."" 

The life fades off his eyes as the whole world around him starts fading away in light. Scott rushes and makes out of the portal in time as he takes the tempad and equipment from that antman.

He faints as he is exhausted. He is woken up by the sight of biomechanic pair of eyes staring at him.

As he wakes up and rushes up to stand he sees an almost torn White Vision, star lord  and some of the  west coast avengers waking Scott up but he sees the destruction and realizes it‚Äôs too late.

He is escorted to him house to find Janet Van Dyne dead, Hank pym injured and Hope in a beaten down suit

He asks ""where‚Äôs Cassie?"" As he cries to the sight of this and vision ensures she is safe with trusted people (young avengers).

He gets to call her from someone else‚Äôs phone and he cries hearing her voice as she implies he has been gone missing for a very long time. He hangs up and looks at the sight of the skyline getting destroyed. 

The last words he says are ""It‚Äôs way too late"" as a green force destroys a huge skyscraper in the distance from the window.

The End.

1jrhm54,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBusinessMix/comments/1jrhm54/new_starbucks_ceo_brian_niccol_was_already/,New Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol was already worried about high prices. Now tariffs have suddenly added a bitter ingredient to his plans,"President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, placing high taxes on imports from dozens of countries and a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports to the U.S. The president hopes his drastic actions will nudge businesses to buy supplies from American producers and make products in the U.S.. For coffee retailers like Starbucks, however, the levies will be impossible to dodge given that less than 1% of coffee consumed in the country is made domestically.

‚ÄúStarbucks is either going to have lower margins and keep the prices where they are, or they'll be forced to raise prices,‚Äù says Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College.

1jrhkga,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1jrhkga/success_story_treating_lpr/,Success story: Treating LPR,"Hi everyone. I've been struggling with silent reflux for the past year or so. I sought treatment after waking up in the middle of the night to a full blown laryngospasm. My symptoms before improving included choking awake on acid at night, throat clearing, dry cough, itchy throat, and globus sensation. I saw my primary care doctor and ENT.
Anyways, I almost never experience these symptoms any more and wanted to share what worked for me. I got a lot of tips from other posters along the way and thought I'd put in my two cents for what was effective on the off chance it helps someone else!

Medication: 
1. My doctor told me to take pepcid AC before bed every night for a month. I did this, but I'm not sure if it did much. I don't take any meds currently.
 
Lifestyle changes: 
1. Stress management. Easier said than done, but this flared up for me in the midst of prolonged severe stress. 

2. Wedge pillow. I still sleep on this. 

3. No eating before bed for 3 hours. I used to always eat before bed. This was a hard transition. If I get hungry before bed I'll eat something very small and light like some crackers just so I can fall asleep. I literally can't fall asleep hungry!

Diet changes:

For the first month I did a really strict diet. I read the acid watchers book and tried my best to follow it, although I am vegetarian so I had to make some adjustments. After the first month, I started to trial foods back in and found just a few culprits.

1. Chocolate. Omg I get immediate reflux from this. Worst offender. Can't have any.

2. Too much fat. I love fats. Nut butters, oils, etc. I still eat these but started limiting the amount I use and also avoid fried foods.

3. Spicy stuff. No surprise there.

4. Weirdly, bananas. 

5. Coffee has to be dark roast and needs to be with breakfast, not before it.

*Some triggers that are common but I didn't eat before anyways so are also excluded from my diet include alcohol, red meat, and soda.*

I hope this helps someone! It felt really overwhelming to me at first with all of the things you can't eat or do, but I am able to eat some of the things that are on the no list still. I don't feel super restricted with these changes and am much healthier and happier and get better sleep. Best of luck to everyone! Feel free to ask any questions.",2,1743787732.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

That made me realize that I'd feel ashamed for giving into my cravings and I didn't want to have to work my day around this one big calorie expenditure when I have already bought groceries, had set out a meal plan, and definitely have food and coffee at home.

I also know that going for that chocolate croissant would set me up for an insulin rollercoaster and *more cravings* later on.

I'm so proud of myself! I ended up making a protein chocolate chia pudding with chopped strawberries (345 cals) and a coffee (70 cals). I feel so accomplished! üòä

It can be a struggle. I understand ""food noise"" has recently become apart of many people's vocabularies, but it is so helpful to do yourself that favor of building and exercising self-discipline. If you're wondering how to build that discipline, you must understand that it is linked to mindfulness. To increase mindfulness, you can meditate and journal daily. I'm sure there are other ways, too.

1jrhg4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jrhg4f/the_insecurity_i_have_and_the_situation_i_had_to/,The insecurity i have and the situation i had to put myself in inorder to make that person live a happy life by hurting that person a little.,"So everything was fucking perfect until i joined college. I was all joyful ready to make new friends and ready have a girlfriend and have a fucking change in character. I was excited to live the college live i dreamt.
Then comes the 2nd sem of my college, the day that took all from me ( well not actually all but a part of me ü§£ ). In january, 2020, on a beautiful day i was watching web series in my room i was at home. I had this sudden pain and it was increasing and was getting more painful minute by minute. I thought fuck it should eventually went away. The biggest mistake it didnt, i told my mother regarding this she immediately called my father and my father took me to a hospital but at that time it was night and the doctor was not there. So i took a pill and slept. Second day the pain arose and it was killing me. We went to the hospital, i knew jack shit bout what was going to happen and boom i went into the surgery room. I came back with one of my testicle removed. My father told me everything is fine and my sex life will be good and there is nothing to worry bout. I might be in so much shock that i didnt thought of it much. I was bed rest for couple of weeks. I went to college after a month and let everyone believe that i had a severe fever and everyone believed me. But deep down to cope up with the insecurity of having only one testicle i started to focus my time gaming and smoking so that i can forget bout it. I never talked bout it nor my family did. Actually if i want to talk bout it with my family they will hear me and i know everything is fine with me and all but still i cant let this escape me. I made no female friends and was always ignoring everyone and keeping myself in solitude.

Then one day after my college was finished i got a job. While working there i got my eyes on this beautiful girl, fcking great nature and perfection at its best, felt like i can wife her. I asked her out we dated for a month and got into relationship. Two months were soo smooth that i hardly recalled that i thought that i had only one testis. This was the first time i saw a girl and be with one who made me feel like it. I never told her that i have only one. One day she asked me for a commitment, the day, that took away everything from me. That day made me remember what i have and it is not right for me to be with a girl who loves me and i love her to give her commitment without telling her the secret. I had this insecurity that if i tell her she will leave me. So, i decided to do the opposite, i tried to push her away whenever i got the opportunity, made myself crybaby in front of her so that she loose interest in me and she feels like i am not ambitious and what not. Well it worked. I even tried to tell her that i had nauseas for 3 years and we have suffered the same i can feel what she goes through and what not, but she never asked me why and i couldn't tell her directly bout my insecurity.
Then one day she said she is leaving, we chatted bout this for a week and she said she is afraid of loosing people she loves and i said its alright to loose people you love, if the person loves you they will come back to you no matter what. After that week we went for a coffee, the vibe was too dry for me, i could see her walk away but fcking i couldn't tell her that i just want you to ask me why and would have told her everything but courage is what i lack. On 31st December at night, she wrote a message to me and we broke up. I was happy and sad at that time. I was happy because i sacrifice my joy for her but sad because i believe that i want to be with the women who chooses me disregard of what i have( the insecurity).

Well she had still not blocked me yet, so for a month i did all this weird kind of posting stories on insta and all, all to tell her bout my situation, but she was not ready to listen, so one day i let my anger out on her so that she just blocks me, and she didü•≥. She said she is deleting me forever and good bye and no bad intentions intended. I wrote wrong things to  her in anger that she wasn't even in the slightest form.

The thing is now it has been 3 months and 4 days from the break up day and 2 months from getting blocked. But you see i never saw her face these months not even her pictures to relive the moments and all. But somehow she still comes in my dreams and that day makes me sad alot. She is still the first thought i have when i wake up and the last thought before sleeping. I tried to keep myself busy to forget her but it cant happen. I seriously cant forget the women who made me forget bout my insecurity that i had these years without even knowing. I cry everytime i go for a bath, it has become like a routine for me. I cry everytime i go to sleep. I might have loose 10 kgs in weight and the dark circles has become too dark because of not getting proper sleep. 


The thing is, is it the right thing i did of letting her go knowing she is perfect for me or i made the fcking worst decision of my life by not communicating. Well, i tried to date other girls but it is impossible for me to because of the insecurity or it could be her. Either way i cant date. People and friends around me have girlfriends and some are even getting married. I want to get married with the women whom i love, the love marriage i want, cause arrange marriage is out of box cause i dont want a women who has to decide that without knowing me.

I still think of just calling her and tell her but too scared cause i might be violating the boundaries and also sacred to know if my number has been blocked or not. 
I have this delusional thought that if i get successful i can just go to her house and ask her out to try again with me, but this time telling her what is was and why i was holding back. Getting all this delusional thoughts at night and day which makes me cry more. Fck i have never cried this lot in my entire life and it doesn't stop. 

Is it alright to make a girl make this decision to be with me? Is it even right thing to do?

I am financially not stable right now so i am working on it but by the time i will be wont it be too late for me to have a loving girlfriend that turns into marriage but it is the only option i have.

Life is doomed for me, but have to move on untill i laugh to the situation and not cry bout it, untill all the tears are dried up.",1,1743787431.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1jrhf41,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyBreakRoom/comments/1jrhf41/am_i_being_unreasonable/,Am I being unreasonable?,"So for context I have worked with my current NF for approximately 3.5 years! I have loved working with the kids for the most part however currently I have really been struggling with them the past couple of months. For reference MB never releases me on time and multiple times a week I‚Äôm asked to stay past my hours. Which is fine for most days because I do get paid for overtime for most of my time except when it‚Äôs like 10-30 minutes after I was suppose to already be off. This is also in part because I‚Äôm like what your gonna pay me $10 for the 30 minutes to me that‚Äôs pointless. So instead I just show up the next day like 10 minutes late because in my mind that makes since. If I leave late I‚Äôm starting late especially when MB loves to tell me 5-10 minutes before I‚Äôm getting off to be like hey my meeting is done which really means it‚Äôs going to be another 45 min. MB also is frequently out of town at least once a week which means in those days I have to work from 7am-9PM. I‚Äôm always asked by DB like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna need you to work late tomorrow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if you can. And of course I have to because if he can‚Äôt work then obviously I don‚Äôt get paid. 

I‚Äôve also noticed that as of recently DB has been asking me to do a more things that aren‚Äôt in my contract. Like Tuesday I came in and his first words were ‚Äú you might need to unload the dishwasher I didn‚Äôt get time to do it. ‚Äú Mind you he is saying all of this with a cup of coffee in hand while standing in front of the dishwasher. Like why would I need to unload a dishwasher that I didn‚Äôt load nor did I dirty up the dishes that were in there. Nor is it in my contract. 

Then this is where it gets really beautiful üôÉ. This week we have had like a week straight of severe thunderstorms which have required the family to take shelter in what is essentially my work space which is fine. However when I arrived I was told ‚Äúhey sorry about the mess in the area we had to take shelter so the kids made a big mess and we weren‚Äôt able to clean it up. Cool. So I clean up the mess and carry on my merry way. The following day one NK told MB that he wasn‚Äôt feeling well so she allowed him to stay home. I found this out once I arrived because they never tell me that the kids are sick until I show up for work. Which is irritating in itself because why do you think it‚Äôs ok to put me at risk for also getting sick? Especially when I don‚Äôt have health benefits included in the job so if I get sick I have to pay out of pocket and we all know how expensive American health care can be. NK who is 11 pretends to be sick all day right up  until his friends come home from school and then suddenly his sickness is gone! How shocking.  So yesterday I took the kids to an adventure center near us as they were begging to go since they didn‚Äôt have school due to severe weather. MB said it was ok so I took them DB currently wasn‚Äôt home which is who normally the one who pays me back whatever we spend on our fun days. On the way to the adventure center I texted DB and told him where we were going and that i would pay with my card and that he can just send me back however much we send and he said ok. The afternoon comes and I send him the receipt. He never says anything back but later that night messages me about baby monitor because he couldn‚Äôt find it. Again never says anything about my sending me my money back even though I know he saw my message as my message was directly above  the message where he asked about the baby monitor.  

Which now brings us to today. As soon as I walk in this morning I‚Äôm met with soo NK who is 12 is staying how because now they are sick even though we spent the whole day prior out of the house and at the adventure center. Now I‚Äôm not saying they too are faking but as soon as dad is relaying the message to me that NK is going got be staying home NK is standing behind with a smirk because their sibling pulled the sick card earlier in the week and now they are too. I was also met with yet another ‚Äúhey sorry for the basement again! We took shelter in basement again last night due to severe weather again‚Äùwhich is true yes because we did have severe weather but it‚Äôs not that hard to make the kids clean up their giant messes prior me getting there. The kids are definitely old enough to do so. Especially since I always clean the space at the end of the day but every morning I come back to it destroyed by the kids. So what do I do ? I clean it up of course. Then I come back up the stairs and he‚Äôs like also ‚Äú Can you do some of their laundry it‚Äôs upstairs. I go up the stairs and guess whose laundry is also thrown in with the kids‚Ä¶DB of course. The final and last straw this morning was since he has yet to pay me back for taking the kids to the adventure center I  decided to physically hand him the receipt in hopes that that would remind him that he still hasn‚Äôt paid me back. I give him the receipt and he‚Äôs like ‚Äú thanks I‚Äôll put it in my office ‚Äú.  That was 5 hrs ago and he has yet to send me my money in addition to the money that I‚Äôm owed for overtime. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is the beginning of what burn out feels like or if it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs Friday and I‚Äôm irritated at this whole week and I‚Äôm just ready to go home in addition to still waiting to get my money back. Someone please tell me do you think I‚Äôm being dramatic and unreasonable? How do you address this?",3,1743787360.0,NannyBreakRoom,1,1.0,False

I occasionally have a midday decaf coffee.

Dinner is a rotation of meats and some veggies. 

I use carb manager to track everything and weigh most of everything I am going to eat.

We had been together for one year prior to that. We fought a lot but also had great moments together. We were both willing to work on our issues and even agreed to go to counseling to put in the effort. However, after his father passed away, he said that everything was just too much for him, and he didn‚Äôt want to work on the relationship anymore. He told me he‚Äôd like us to meet sometime in the future to talk about life and maybe reconnect. I told him I needed no contact to heal. He broke that rule a few times, but eventually, he understood that I was serious about needing space.

At first, I felt his actions were selfish because they hindered my healing process, and he didn‚Äôt respect my boundary. But I focused on working on myself through therapy and moved forward with my life.

Fast forward to a year after the breakup: he reached out to me, and since I missed him as a person (I still loved him and missed him, but I was aware the relationship wasn‚Äôt ideal), I agreed to meet up for a catch-up. I thought that his dad passing away must have been traumatic for him, so I felt more sympathy for the breakup and thought that if he felt better, we could possibly work things out and have a healthy relationship. When we met, I realized I still had feelings for him, but I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be meeting again after that. However, he began to regularly reach out (he was reaching out, not me), and we saw each other almost every weekend (it felt like dating; we went for coffee, long walks, and to the cinema). One time, he started kissing me and tried to initiate sex. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to have sex unless it meant some sort of commitment and an effort to fix the relationship. He was really surprised and started acting distant toward me. When I brought this up, he said I was overthinking it and that he was only being distant because he needed to calm himself and keep his emotions in check.

After that, we met a few more times, and again, he initiated intimacy. Please understand, it was really hard for me to resist, so I engaged in it. I know I should have stuck to my boundary, and I messed up. However, I repeated that it would hurt me if it didn‚Äôt lead to something meaningful. Since he was still initiating things, I thought maybe he wanted a commitment. I told him I still had feelings for him, and he said he also had feelings for me. I was planning to talk to him about it, but I kept delaying it (over the next two weekend meetups) out of fear of losing him.

Then, one time, I gave in and we had sex, but afterward, he didn‚Äôt reach out for a week. When we met at a dinner organized by mutual friends, it was very awkward because we hadn‚Äôt spoken since the night we had sex. I left early, and afterward, he called me to ask if everything was okay between us. He said he was aware we crossed a boundary, and he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me. He then told me that he didn‚Äôt want to build a serious relationship right now. He said he didn‚Äôt want to block me from pursuing other relationships but still wanted to remain friends and maybe reconnect in the future, though it would be too much pressure to expect it. I expected this, but it still hurt. I asked why he hadn‚Äôt told me sooner, and he said he didn‚Äôt know. I think he did know, but he just wanted to have a good time with me anyway. He admitted he could have communicated better, but he also said I could have said no to him, and if it helped me, I could blame him. But he didn‚Äôt agree that he did anything wrong.

The conversation wasn‚Äôt a fight, it was pretty calm, but the next day, I was in a really bad mental state. I cried all day. We texted a little afterward, but I decided I couldn‚Äôt continue communicating with him. I haven‚Äôt replied to his messages for a few days.

I want to conclude this situation maturely and not leave him on read. I‚Äôm planning to send a message saying I needed time to process everything, but I will need to cut off contact with him moving forward. I want to keep it short, amicable, and to the point. But it breaks my heart.

What do you think about this situation? I feel used and that he didn‚Äôt care enough to protect me. It seems like he preferred his own pleasure over considering my feelings, but I don‚Äôt think he sees it that way. I‚Äôll discuss this in my next therapy session. It doesn‚Äôt seem like he cares much about my feelings, and when I expressed that, he said it wasn‚Äôt true and that he called to clarify that he doesn‚Äôt want a serious relationship right now, but he will respect any decision I make about us talking. However, he would be glad if we could figure it out and have each other in our lives.

You should hear him ramble about stuff he likes- its adorable.

ANYWAY

we have 1 mutual friend who apparently TOLD him abt my feelings and he didnt say anything back, just smiled silently for the rest of the class. which could be nothing i mean everyone likes hearing that someone likes you right? Apparently this guy does simple small things with me that he doesnt do with others, an example being that I had to send a message to another class and i had asked if i can bring someone along- (that being my crush) and after a tiny bit of pleading he came !! I told the mutual friend abt it during my ramble and she says how he never does that with her and their friends. Couldve just been him trying to be nice but idk

Hes just always really sweet and plays games with me. I love it hes just so dorky URGRGRGGR.

ALSO, he takes this class where you do barista and like take coffee orders from teachers and hand them their drinks while theyre teaching, He has this when im doing a practical class so i never get to see him during his wraparounds of my class. BUT my friend claims that when i wasnt looking at him HE was looking at ME. She swears this isnt a joke but idk wether or not to believe it or to even THINK that he might like me.

I‚Äôm weight and height proportional, muscular but not a total gym rat. Don‚Äôt have a body type but do require weight and height proportionate, slightly chubby is fine.

I‚Äôm a nerdy gear head that loves machines as well as food and coffee. I‚Äôm a man‚Äôs man but very emotionally intelligent. I also love to be in the kitchen, whether it‚Äôs cooking or baking. Also coffee, I love coffee and matcha. 

I‚Äôm  also not a big drinker and don‚Äôt need alcohol to have fun. I‚Äôd rather be fully present with someone I care deeply about. 


Hoping to take it slow and swap pics, and if there‚Äôs a connection, meet for coffee.

I‚Äôve got a bit of a wild theory that I thought I‚Äôd share with you all, and I‚Äôm curious what you think. In the 2012 Three Stooges movie, there‚Äôs a scene where their pet mouse, Nippy, goes ‚Äúeeb eeb eeb eeb eeb!‚Äù ‚Äî a catchphrase that was classic Shemp in the original films. Now, hear me out‚Ä¶

What if Shemp didn‚Äôt just disappear after his time with the Stooges? What if, in some weird, Stooges-style twist, he reincarnated as Nippy the mouse?! ü§Ø

Think about it: Shemp was the replacement for Curly, and in the movie, he‚Äôs notably absent. But the mouse, who makes that unmistakable ‚Äúeeb eeb eeb‚Äù sound, could be a subtle (and totally ridiculous) homage to Shemp‚Äôs character, without the Stooges ever realizing it! They might be reunited with Shemp in this completely unexpected form, but the guys are none the wiser.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: throughout the movie, Nippy is mostly held by Moe and Curly, which makes total sense since Moe, Curly, and Shemp were brothers in real life. Maybe, in this odd reincarnation, Nippy is being ‚Äúheld‚Äù by the brothers once again, as if Shemp is reunited with his family in a totally bizarre way!

I know this sounds kind of out there, but it feels like something the Stooges would totally do, right? Let me know if you think I‚Äôm onto something, or if I‚Äôve just had too much coffee today! üòÇ",3,1743786377.0,threestooges,0,0.8,False

I know it‚Äôs been a while, but some wounds don‚Äôt scab over, they just stay open quietly, tucked beneath the surface. I still write to you, even if these words never make it past the paper. Maybe I just need to believe you‚Äôre somewhere out there‚Äîstill listening, still watching over me with those eyes that once made the whole world hush.

I wonder if you‚Äôd laugh at me now, seeing how often I talk to the wind like you‚Äôre in it. I can almost hear your voice teasing me, calling me dramatic, maybe tossing a pillow at my head like you used to when I got too lost in my thoughts. God, I miss that‚Äîthe soft, silly chaos of you. I miss *you* in the small things most: your half-hummed songs in the kitchen, the way you‚Äôd get too emotional watching animated movies, how you'd bury your cold feet under mine at night and grin like it was a truce.

Do you remember the night we sat on the balcony with that bottle of cheap red wine and counted planes like they were stars? You said if you ever left before me, you‚Äôd haunt the wind chimes so I‚Äôd know it was you. I hung them up last month, and they moved‚Äîjust once‚Äîwhen the air was still. Maybe it was nothing. But maybe it was you. I choose to believe it was you.

You always believed in the poetic‚Äîeven when life didn‚Äôt deserve it. You gave meaning to the mundane. I remember you pressing my hand to your chest once and saying, ‚ÄúEven if I leave, this‚Äîthat love‚Äîwon‚Äôt.‚Äù And you were right. It hasn‚Äôt. Not for a single moment. It‚Äôs burned on, through every tear-stained morning, through every hollow laugh I forced out to make people believe I was okay. They ask how I‚Äôm doing. I say, ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù like a lie dressed up in polite clothing. But inside, I‚Äôm still reaching for you in the dark.

The bed‚Äôs still too big. Your side‚Äôs still untouched like I‚Äôm holding the space sacred in case you walk through the door and ask me what‚Äôs for dinner. I still cook your favourite pasta sometimes. I cry every time. It tastes like missing you.

Everyone tells me grief softens with time. Maybe they‚Äôre right, but maybe I don‚Äôt want it to. If the pain dulls, will the love, too? Because loving you‚Äî*even now*‚Äîis the truest thing I‚Äôve ever done.

I live in a world that no longer holds you, and yet you are everywhere. In the smell of old bookstores. In thunderstorms. In the first sip of morning coffee. In music that hits just a little too close to home. I heard that one song you loved the other day, and I completely lost it. I sat in my car with the engine running, sobbing like a fool in a grocery store parking lot. And then I laughed because you always said I was too dramatic to cry quietly.

I hope you‚Äôre somewhere warm, somewhere full of music and light, where your body no longer aches, where your soul can dance without gravity. I hope you found your peace‚Äîbut selfishly, I hope you kept a piece of yourself for me. Because I‚Äôm still here. Still love you. Still writing. Still waiting.

One day, when my own heart grows quiet, I‚Äôll come find you. And we‚Äôll pick up right where we left off‚Äîmaybe in a place where no one leaves, where time doesn‚Äôt matter, and where love is never something we have to lose again. 

  
And when at last my time comes, when Death extends to me her chill, pale hand, I shall not fear her. For I shall know‚Äîbeyond her threshold, you are waiting. And I shall come to you, swift as the wind, unburdened at last by grief or time. I shall find you amid the stars, in that golden garden beyond the reach of sorrow, and fall once more into your arms.

Till then, my beloved, I remain‚Äî

I (29/M) am planning a \~10 day trip to Wales in late July/early August. I'll be starting in Newbridge as I have prior arrangements there but I'd like to hit Pembrokeshire, explore the park and walk the coast as much as possible and then hit Snowdonia and end the trip with a relaxing couple of days enjoying Brecon Beacons before I take the train back to Cardiff  to fly out. For reasons I won't explain, I couldn't fly out of Manchester so I've accepted the loop just is what it is. 

  
This is my first time backpacking, and so I'm looking for any and all advice. I'm preparing to be able to do 20mi/day walks but obviously will be taking the train/bus as needed to make this possible in 10+ days. I'm extremely nervous for the progressive journey. Basically making sure I have lodging accommodations and planning out distances properly. Also, hostels during this time of the year is no less than 100 euros a night! What the heck! 

  
My plan for food was to carry essentials to keep my energy high during the hikes, but end each night with a hearty meal at a restaurant before heading into my hostel. Is one big meal a day sufficient? Should I be starting my trek as early as I can or do I want to wait and hit some local shops for breakfast and coffee before I go on my way. Are you guys bringing tons of gels/bars and how do I best balance packing light while being sufficiently prepared?

  
I've always wanted to try something like this, but never had the courage to send it. Spacial awareness is not my strong suit and so doing this solo is a bit uncomfortable, but I'm turning 30 during this trip and it might quite literally be my last chance to do something with my unexpected freedom in this chapter of my life. Hoping you guys can give me a push so I don't flake on this! I want this to be a carefree and spontaneous trip, but I don't want to go unprepared for the things that shouldn't go unprepared!

My recent r4r post stays true: 

Looking for a cute guy (or anyone, I'm bi) who knows what he wants.

I don't have time to fix anyone anymore‚ÄîI need someone who already knows what they want: me. If that's not you, no hard feelings. Just keep scrolling. I have pics on my feed, so l'd like to see yours if you want to talk.

You should love food (l'm a foodie who creates content about cheap travels) and like coffee (cause I can't live without it). I hope you're nice and never condescending-rude mansplaining dudes irk the life out of me. I like tall guys who look clean and smell good. Love that BDE.

Please, please be patient because I tend to overthink, I'm intense, and I need someone who won't make me feel bad about it. I write, binge-watch, read, and bake a lot. I'm a leftist, have bipolar disorder, and also my family's breadwinner. I'm not expecting you to provide for me, but if you are the type who'd spoil their partner, then I'm not one to complain.

Decided to stay in Da Nang by the end of the year since I can work from anywhere. So if you can also work remotely and want to see the world with me, even better.
In bed? Use me as you please. But more than anything, I crave attention and cuddles. I'm down for NSFW but I'm ultimately a hopeless romantic who still believes love can be easy. So please don't be too naughty when you approach.

As cringe as it may sound, I just want someone to do life with. And be their favorite.

Since I‚Äôm creating content, it‚Äôs a big deal when you show support as you follow my socials. I don‚Äôt have discord or snap. But will gladly give my number for WhatsApp or iMessage if we vibe :)

1jrgx1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jrgx1b/reconnected_with_ex_and_i_feel_used/,Reconnected with ex and I feel used,"My ex-boyfriend (30M) and I (30F) broke up after his dad passed away. We had been together for one year prior to that. We fought a lot but also had great moments together. We were both willing to work on our issues and even agreed to go to counseling to put in the effort. However, after his father passed away, he said that everything was just too much for him, and he didn‚Äôt want to work on the relationship anymore. He told me he‚Äôd like us to meet sometime in the future to talk about life and maybe reconnect. I told him I needed no contact to heal. He broke that rule a few times, but eventually, he understood that I was serious about needing space.

At first, I felt his actions were selfish because they hindered my healing process, and he didn‚Äôt respect my boundary. But I focused on working on myself through therapy and moved forward with my life.

Fast forward to a year after the breakup: he reached out to me, and since I missed him as a person (I still loved him and missed him, but I was aware the relationship wasn‚Äôt ideal), I agreed to meet up for a catch-up. I thought that his dad passing away must have been traumatic for him, so I felt more sympathy for the breakup and thought that if he felt better, we could possibly work things out and have a healthy relationship. When we met, I realized I still had feelings for him, but I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be meeting again after that. However, he began to regularly reach out (he was reaching out, not me), and we saw each other almost every weekend (it felt like dating; we went for coffee, long walks, and to the cinema). One time, he started kissing me and tried to initiate sex. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to have sex unless it meant some sort of commitment and an effort to fix the relationship. He was really surprised and started acting distant toward me. When I brought this up, he said I was overthinking it and that he was only being distant because he needed to calm himself and keep his emotions in check.

After that, we met a few more times, and again, he initiated intimacy. Please understand, it was really hard for me to resist, so I engaged in it. I know I should have stuck to my boundary, and I messed up. However, I repeated that it would hurt me if it didn‚Äôt lead to something meaningful. Since he was still initiating things, I thought maybe he wanted a commitment. I told him I still had feelings for him, and he said he also had feelings for me. I was planning to talk to him about it, but I kept delaying it (over the next two weekend meetups) out of fear of losing him.

Then, one time, I gave in and we had sex, but afterward, he didn‚Äôt reach out for a week. When we met at a dinner organized by mutual friends, it was very awkward because we hadn‚Äôt spoken since the night we had sex. I left early, and afterward, he called me to ask if everything was okay between us. He said he was aware we crossed a boundary, and he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me. He then told me that he didn‚Äôt want to build a serious relationship right now. He said he didn‚Äôt want to block me from pursuing other relationships but still wanted to remain friends and maybe reconnect in the future, though it would be too much pressure to expect it. I expected this, but it still hurt. I asked why he hadn‚Äôt told me sooner, and he said he didn‚Äôt know. I think he did know, but he just wanted to have a good time with me anyway. He admitted he could have communicated better, but he also said I could have said no to him, and if it helped me, I could blame him. But he didn‚Äôt agree that he did anything wrong.

The conversation wasn‚Äôt a fight, it was pretty calm, but the next day, I was in a really bad mental state. I cried all day. We texted a little afterward, but I decided I couldn‚Äôt continue communicating with him. I haven‚Äôt replied to his messages for a few days.

I want to conclude this situation maturely and not leave him on read. I‚Äôm planning to send a message saying I needed time to process everything, but I will need to cut off contact with him moving forward. I want to keep it short, amicable, and to the point. But it breaks my heart.

What do you think about this situation? I feel used and that he didn‚Äôt care enough to protect me. It seems like he preferred his own pleasure over considering my feelings, but I don‚Äôt think he sees it that way. I‚Äôll discuss this in my next therapy session. It doesn‚Äôt seem like he cares much about my feelings, and when I expressed that, he said it wasn‚Äôt true and that he called to clarify that he doesn‚Äôt want a serious relationship right now, but he will respect any decision I make about us talking. However, he would be glad if we could figure it out and have each other in our lives.

Do you have any advice on how to send him a message to wrap this up? Thank you for reading. I really appreciate any insight you can offer.",1,1743786112.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I tried writing a TLDR version first but unfortunately there‚Äôs just too many details. I wrote about it in another sub, but I wanted to write about it in more depth. Not just to help myself heal, but also to hopefully help others who might be struggling with their marriages. I also want to let victims of childhood SA know that you don‚Äôt have to hate yourself. You don‚Äôt have to let that self hatred destroy your family. You‚Äôre not alone. You can heal and become a better person, no matter how old you are or how bleak your situation seems. But you can‚Äôt do it alone. Reach out to someone.

I‚Äôll start at the beginning. When I was around 4 (my therapist thinks I was probably a little older) I remember going to an office pool party at one of my mother‚Äôs coworker‚Äôs house. I remember the pool, the backyard, and the yellow house vividly. One of the older kids, late teens, maybe early twenties, took me into one of the bedrooms. He forced me to perform oral sex on him. He then took off my bathing suit and sodomized me. I remember crying out in pain and begging him to stop. It was a sobbing heaving cry that a young child would let out when they are in excruciating pain, and unable to comprehend what is happening to them. When he was done using me for his sick evil pleasure, he told me to put my bathing suit back on and go outside and play. He also warned me not to tell anyone or something bad would happen to my parents. I don‚Äôt remember much else about that day. 

A little later, from the time I was about 7 until i was around 10, we would go to visit another family friend about 4 times a year. They had an older son, early twenties, who would take me into his bedroom and force me to perform oral sex on him while the adults were in the living room. 

This led me to a very troubled childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. More than anything else I was filled with self hatred and unprovoked rage at other people, especially people who loved me. I loathed my parents for allowing it to happen to me. Especially my father who was an alcoholic and drug addict and who I blamed for not being there to protect me when I was the most vulnerable. I was a delinquent. I started doing drugs at 14.  I acted out at school and either got suspended or didn‚Äôt bother going. I got into a lot of fights. I hurt a lot of people, physically and emotionally.  I had a lot of learning disabilities and barely passed high school. 

I met my wife in 2000, when she was 18 and I was 22. I fell in love with her instantly. I have blonde hair and blue eyes, and she is the most beautiful Spanish woman I have ever seen. She‚Äôs beautiful, classy , exotic, and intelligent. She has a magnetic beauty that drew me in the second I saw her. The attraction was mutual and intense. At the time I wasn‚Äôt doing drugs, but I was drinking very heavily. It was the only way I knew of to bury the pain. I never physically abused her, and I never cheated on her. But I never treated her the way a man should treat his woman, the love of his life, his soul mate. 

In 2001, we found out we were having a daughter, and we got married. My daughter was born in 2002. It was the most beautiful thing that had ever happened in my life. By the time I was 25, I changed my life completely. I stopped drinking. I got a full time job. I worked on becoming the type of father I always wished I had growing up. We had my son in 2009. I gave my kids the type of childhood every child deserves. They grew up free from abuse, in a loving stable home, with 2 parents who loved them and provided for their every physical and emotional need. 

But I never treated my wife the way she deserved. The self hatred that I thought I had buried was always there. Sometimes under the surface and sometimes consciously. I thought I wasn‚Äôt worthy of her love. I thought as soon as she found out what happened to me, she would be disgusted at me, stop loving me, and leave me. I thought, even if she doesn‚Äôt know what happened to me and never finds out how COULD she love me?  I was just a disgusting piece of discarded (white) trash. Any act of kindness from her would be met with contempt from me. I knew I was sabotaging our marriage but I didn‚Äôt feel like I deserved to be happy. I started drinking again and it created a cycle of getting drunk, allowing my simmering self hatred to boil over, taking my self hatred out on my wife, hating myself more, taking it out on my wife. It was a cycle that lasted about 20 years. 

Last year my father started having a lot of medical problems. He always had, but this time it became apparent that my mother would not be able to take care of him. He needed to be in an assisted living facility with professional medical staff. He became bedridden, which is common for people with late stage Alzheimer‚Äôs. Their brains stop being able to send signals to their legs. We never had any kind of relationship. We were never close. We never spent a second of quality time together in 47 years. When he was admitted to a facility close to my house I made a commitment to myself that I would visit him every day. I wanted to work on forgiving him. I wanted to have some kind of relationship with him before he died. I didn‚Äôt want to let him die alone. Forgiveness wasn‚Äôt about him. It was about me trying to heal myself. Holding onto all those negative emotions was like drinking poison and hoping it hurts someone else. 

But the visits were gut wrenching. He told me that I gave him a reason to want to live. That he had nobody in the world, and if I wasn‚Äôt coming to visit him he would kill himself by stabbing himself in the throat the next time they bring him a steak knife to eat dinner with. He became agitated with everyone and would rage-scream at the nurses trying to help him. He would have vivid hallucinations and scream in terror. Nothing I said could calm him or make him realize that it wasn‚Äôt real. As much as I was trying to forgive him, the only thing I could feel for him was pity, mixed with disgust for living a wasted life that led us to where we were. I was trying to heal, but it was making me worse. In order to deal with it, I would drink and smoke marijuana. That would start the cycle of self hatred and emotional abuse all over again.  This time I escalated it to a higher level than ever. 

A couple months ago she finally had enough. I yelled at her in front of my son and dared her to hit me. I could see the hopelessness in her eyes as she took her ring off and said we were through. It wasn‚Äôt one incident. It was the culmination of 20 years of abuse. It was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. I didn‚Äôt mind. Because of all the hatred I felt for myself, I didn‚Äôt feel like I deserved to be happy. I felt like it was only a matter of time until she found out what happened to me and leave me anyways. I might as well leave her first. Two days later I went to Walmart and bought some moving boxes, packed up some things, and went to live in my mother‚Äôs house. 

After living at my mother‚Äôs house for a week, my emotions boiled over. I felt an immense sadness like I had never felt before. It felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest and I cried for about an hour. I begged my wife to let me move back in, and she allowed me to. But we were living together as strangers. It was gut wrenching. I asked her if she wanted to work on our marriage and all she would say is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet.‚Äù  I saw that as a no which made me resent her more. 

I was with my father when he passed away peacefully. He was in a vegetative state, but I told him I love him and I could see on his face that he heard me and understood. He passed away less than a minute later. To be honest I don‚Äôt know if I love him. But I do know that I truly forgive him. I also know that he suffered from some horrific abuse as a child, and I empathize with him. I don‚Äôt know if it was sexual or physical. But I understand that he didn‚Äôt choose to be the person he was. He was born in a different time and the only reason I didn‚Äôt turn out like him was because I had the love of a beautiful woman. 

I was yearning to start working on fixing my marriage, but my wife wouldn‚Äôt talk to me (not that I blame her). My stomach was in knots. I couldn‚Äôt eat. I was sleeping 1 or 2 hours a night. I‚Äôd be up the rest of the night crying. My work life was suffering. I finally decided that I couldn‚Äôt live like that anymore. I was on the verge of having a nervous breakdown. I came home from work, and I said to her that I need to know right now if you want to stay married. If not I needed closure. At first it looked like it was going to lead to another argument and she was going to tell me she wanted a divorce.  But she opened up to me and told me that when I would get drunk and yell at her, it reminded her of the physical abuse she suffered as a child. We both started crying. I told her about my sexual trauma and how it caused me to take my self hatred out on her.  We talked for an hour and she finally said the words my soul had been yearning to hear for so long. I love you unconditionally. I want to be married to you forever. That being vulnerable with her, and sharing my trauma with her deepened her love for me. We hugged and kissed. We truly forgave each other. A couple days later we made love for the first time in months. It was the most amazing experience of my life. It wasn‚Äôt about the physical pleasure. It was the closeness we felt in our souls for each other. I can‚Äôt put it into words. The emotions I felt were indescribable. 

I‚Äôm in therapy and I‚Äôm trying to work through my trauma. I‚Äôm committed to becoming a better man. I want to be the husband she deserves.  The one I was capable of being the whole time. If I had just reached out to her and told her and realized I can‚Äôt do it on my own. I‚Äôm learning about Attachment Theory and Love Languages. Her love language is acts of service. So I‚Äôm trying to do something thoughtful for her every day. Something as simple as making her coffee or cleaning her car when I have free time.  I love my wife with all my soul. I‚Äôm so grateful to have the chance to spend the rest of my life with her. I know I don‚Äôt deserve her. I know I took her for granted for 25 years and losing her is a real possibility. I‚Äôm going to work on strengthening our relationship every day for the rest of my life. She has shown me what unconditional love is and I‚Äôm truly humbled. 

We had our talk on a Thursday. There was probably no more than a 1 percent chance of saving our marriage. I truly believe that she was planning on taking the next Monday off to go file the divorce paperwork. If you‚Äôre struggling with your marriage or your mental health, don‚Äôt ever give up. Don‚Äôt ever stop fighting. Love is worth it. Your family is worth it. You‚Äôre worth it and you matter. ",8,1743786056.0,Marriage,6,1.0,False
1jrgvmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NativePlantGardening/comments/1jrgvmj/building_up_raised_beds_will_adding_the_leaves/,Building up raised beds - will adding the leaves I've been collecting harm the overwintering bugs?,"Hi all, not strictly native plant gardening but I always appreciate the advice in this sub. The tl;dr of my question is - will moving the leaves we left into a raised bed and covering with soil essentially wipe out any overwintering bugs?

Context: I am building raised veggie beds (18 in. high) and the advice I've gotten is to use layers of leaf mould/compost near the bottom and top of the beds. Early last fall, I raked leaves into a makeshift chicken-wire ""bin"" as they fell, with the intent of using them for the raised beds. That pile now is probably 90% leaves, 10% veggie scraps/coffee grounds, maybe 1.5cu yd in size, and only just starting to decompose. The bin quickly ran out of space, so I just left the rest of the leaves that fell and they basically arranged themselves into a long pile against my fence. Tbh, it's our first year in this house and I didn't expect to have so many leaves lol 

We're going to fill the raised beds within the next 2 weeks, around our avg. last frost date. Temps are warming up but still chaotic (had an 80 degree day followed by a high-30s night last week). Will it be harmful to add the leaves - either those we left aside or those in the ""compost"" bin - to our beds if we move them \*gently\*? Like maybe this is a stupid question, but would the bugs be crushed under the soil? Would they get lost, or still be able to find their way out...? lol

For additional context, I live in a dense suburban hellscape (aka New Jersey) where every neighbor seemingly has a generations-deep vendetta against any sign of life beyond fresh-cut grass (and God help it if a blade steps out of line!!) They will literally leaf blow their 8'x10' front lawn 3 or more times per day. So what I'm saying is I hesitate to just ask for their leaves as I'm assuming there is some heavy pesticide use around here. ",4,1743786023.0,NativePlantGardening,1,0.83,False

***Somewhere a new direct-to-stream drama is missing its opening scene ‚Äì April 2023***  
A cold breeze rolled through the city as Adrian Sloane adjusted his coat. The rhythm of New York: horns blaring, conversations blending, hurried footsteps against pavement was something he found grounding.

He had been walking toward the subway station when he saw two uniformed NYPD officers pinning a man against a brick wall, cuffing him. The arrest itself wasn‚Äôt unusual, but the moment Adrian caught sight of the suspect‚Äôs face, his breath hitched.

He knew this man.

Not personally, but from somewhere else, though he could not put his finger on it.

As he kept walking, his mind went back and forth and back to‚Ä¶ last week when he had been flipping through an archive of historical paintings at Columbia University. One in particular had caught his attention: an 1891 oil portrait of a man in a charcoal-grey suit, standing near a gas-lit street corner in what was then a much younger New York. The artist had captured the subject‚Äôs sharp features, the intensity in his stare, the way his lips pressed together as if he held some unspoken truth.

And now, that same man, unchanged and unaged, was being shoved into the back of an NYPD RMP.

Sloane‚Äôs pulse quickened. This wasn‚Äôt just a trick of the mind. He had studied that face for minutes, absorbed in the painter‚Äôs meticulous details. There was no mistaking it.

His eyes flicked to the suspect‚Äôs wrist as the officers cuffed him. A tattoo peeked from beneath the frayed edge of his sleeve. It was faint, but Sloane recognized the design instantly: a single watching eye, surrounded by a broken circle.

He had seen that symbol before, and the chilling warning that had come with it.

Sloane stood frozen for a moment, the image of the man‚Äôs face burned into his mind. This wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. It couldn‚Äôt be. He needed proof, something tangible. He turned on his heel, walking fast, his destination already set.

***Back into the archives***  
The archives at Columbia were silent except for the soft hum of the security lights overhead. Sloane sat hunched over his laptop, fingers tapping rapidly as he fed an AI facial recognition program the images of the historical portrait and the local news footage of the arrest.

The results were chilling.

The same face appeared over and over again.

In an 1853 daguerreotype of a crowd outside a courthouse. In a 1921 Prohibition-era police photo. In a blurry 1957 shot of a subway station. Always the same man, never aging. His name changed each time, but his features did not.

A newspaper clipping from 1952 detailed the arrest of a man with no verifiable identity, detained after being caught in a restricted government building. He had been booked, held overnight in a cell‚Ä¶ and by morning, he was gone. No forced entry, no signs of escape. The report was buried under police bureaucracy and quietly forgotten.

His thoughts drifted back to the symbol on the man's wrist. He had seen it before and it had come with a warning. Heart hammering, Sloane grabbed his notes and left, heading for the one person who might help him.

***A Skeptic‚Äôs Resistance***  
‚ÄúYou expect me to believe this guy‚Äôs been alive for over a hundred years?‚Äù Carter tossed the folder onto his desk, arms crossed as he leaned back in his chair. His office smelled like old paper and coffee gone stale, the blinds half-drawn to block out the setting sun.

‚ÄúI expect you to investigate‚Äù Sloane countered, standing over him.

Carter exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. ‚ÄúJesus, Sloane.‚Äù He picked up one of the grainy photographs, scanning it. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt proof. It‚Äôs a coincidence.‚Äù

Sloane leaned in, tapping a finger against one of the images. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs just a coincidence that the guy I saw arrested today is in this painting from 1891? In this newspaper from 1952? In a police report from a century ago?‚Äù

Carter didn‚Äôt answer right away. His gut told him to reject it outright, but‚Ä¶ something in Sloane‚Äôs expression made him pause.

‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù Carter finally muttered.

‚ÄúI want you to get me real proof. There‚Äôs a deli across the street from the precinct. Their cameras would have picked him up before the cops got to him. Maybe it‚Äôll show us where he was coming from, what he was doing before they grabbed him.‚Äù

Carter shook his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a badge anymore, professor.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou still know how to get things done.‚Äù

Carter sighed, grabbing his coat. 'Come on. But if this is a waste of my time, I‚Äôm sending you my bar tab.

The grounds stick to the filter, so you have to rinse them off anyways.

Start out by adding enough water to cover the plunger.  Then when you pull the plunger out, the water will rinse off most of the grounds stuck to the filter and leave them in the carafe. 

Now you can swirl the water and grounds in the carafe and dump them in a strainer.  A cheap reusable permanent coffee filter basket ($6 USD) works much better than any kitchen strainer.  From there, you can shake that out into the trash or compost, minimizing mess and the amount of ground going down the drain",14,1743785991.0,LifeProTips,25,0.64,False

It's not even a lot, honestly 42k would have me singing. No customer service for me though, just hours of busy work. Mind melting but I don't mind. I'm just happy to have a degree that got me somewhere where I don't have to tangle with people who don't know how to act. No grease, no cleaning chemicals, just a mundane office job. 

Friday is coming! I'm so excited. I have to let my son know so he can prepare. He loves seeing Grandma and Grandpa at their nice bungalow with a backyard. He likes catching up with his cool uncle who is 19 and has a car so they can take rides to Sam's Club for a hotdog or pizza slice. My partner is already pre-planning fun stuff for us to do over the weekend while in my parents city. I miss my hometown. Maybe this time we can go to a cool Museum or theme park and then catch some alone time at an adult event late Saturday night. We plan to surprise my parents Sunday morning with coffee and donuts as a treat but we also plan to cook them a full breakfast just for fun. Our son makes a great mini omelette, with supervision of course. 

We come back home Sunday night. I ask our son if his homework was done. We go over it one more time before I give him free time to hang before bed. My partner and I unpack the car and stuff and watch a show into the late night. When our son is asleep maybe we take a little THC gummy and get frisky. I wake up Monday morning, maybe a little more tired than usual, but just happy I got to have some fun. I peek in our son's room as I get ready to go to work for the day and smile at a crayon drawing he's left on his bed or floor or desk. 

This is the dream life I want. I could've easily had this in my hands if I'd just been raised with caring and emotionally mature parents. Instead I have a weak enabling mother who taught me that we all as women have to be useless doormats, and my stepfather is a very mean spirited Narcissist who is slowly taking himself and his fortunes to the grave. My future children will never meet them. I have no career or salary paid job. The ONE I managed to get ended up closing down after not even 5 months of me being paid at a rate that would've been $42k annually. It was $700 a week but it meant EVERYTHING to me. I have no support network or system. I left my homestate to get the hell away from my parents. I hate my life. Everyone else around me seems to have these wholesome family moments or people they can rely on to JUST BE THERE for major milestones and I have nobody but my partner who is in the same boat as far as bring cursed with a shitty set of predatory and transactional parents. I could've been raised more well adjusted but my parents decided to ignore and blatantly disregard my AuDHD so I've been just goofing it with no medicine or nothing my whole life. I just barely figured my diagnosis out so I can't get disability because I've already proved I can work, despite almost every customer facing job I've had causing me to end up heavily suicidal and contemplating jumping to my death. People are too stimulating. I HATE ATTENTION FROM CREEPS. Especially the customers that won't take fucking no or go away as an answer when they keep trying to shoot their shot. I want a reset.

It's unfathomable to me to think about how my best friend, is no longer my best friend. I can't make him (33M) do anything. I've made the mistakes I've made, I'm experienced the way I'm experienced. And he's done with it. I've exhausted him and blame myself every day. 

I'm in therapy, I've beginning to find answers to heath issues, I'm in a healthier living situation, still doing school full time while raising my daughter as best I can, I've switched to eating much more ancestorial foods to help my body, tried juijitsu (just can't afford or have the time anymore), quit coffee, been game planning and stocking up on end of the world type supplies (lol), being intentional in friendships, gaining awareness of my thresholds and where I might need to reign things in.

How do I harness this beast within myself when my anger and passion rages? How do I wield this sharp tool? When have I overdone in and how do I regulate? I think of a video I saw about movies and color theory on blue specifically. They mentioned Hades ""calm"" was blue, but the moment he raged, he was more red and orange. Blue is a hotter flame, yet he appears composed-- meaning Hades is constantly regulating his intense emotions. 

I really don't know what I'm saying at this point. I'm just trying to figure out my life after my ex wants nothing to do with me because I have issues and made mistakes. I don't even think really reaching out for help or advice. Just writing I guess. 

I'm working on forgiveness and having more compassion. Which actually compassion and affection have been such a big part of my being, so like how the hell did I lose that with him? I remember so many times reaching out or wanting closeness. I think I'm kind of coming to this idea or conclusion that maybe he actually secretly wanted this the whole time but has been emotionally broken down because 1. I pushed the first domino and 2. It hurts to separate from someone you love regardless. 

It's more than a hard pill to swallow. It's feels like an anchor being thrown into your chest cavity by a machine. I've never felt this much guilt, shame, and disappointment in my life. And there's times I want to disappear. Anyway. That's that. ",4,1743785562.0,Divorce,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been living with and caring for my nana, who‚Äôs is a mum to me 75, smoked since she was 15. In December, she had a scan that found something on her lung. She just had another two scans in March, and it‚Äôs grown by 3mm. The doctor told us today that it‚Äôs more than likely cancer. It looks like a hollow with a thick lining not a cyst on her left lung but no where else. But they can‚Äôt do a biopsy because she has emphysema and her lungs are too fragile. She will continue to smoke, i can use patches on her but she currently sleeps in a room that she smokes in as she cant get upstairs.

They‚Äôre doing a team meeting this Thursday to decide on the stage and next steps, but he said they won‚Äôt be offering treatment like chemo because her body likely wouldn‚Äôt handle it he said it would kill her doing a biopsy so I'm assuming its the same with treatment. So they‚Äôre working on a clinical diagnosis based on scans and symptoms.

Right now, she:

* Lives downstairs in her living room in a hospital bed (bathroom is upstairs)
* Uses a commode toilet in the kitchen as its a council home and theres no toilet downstairs
* Can walk very short distances (like to the kitchen to make coffee), but can‚Äôt cook or do much else
* Has a very low immune system, and we‚Äôre worried about her breathing getting worse

I know the basics‚Äîkeep her comfortable, be there for her‚Äîbut I wanted to ask:

* Is there anything I can give her or ask for that would help with her breathing? we have a nebuliser, i dont mind splashing the cash if it makes her breath better (We‚Äôre in the UK)
* Are there UK services (NHS or otherwise) that can support people in this kind of situation at home?
* Has anyone else been through this how did you cope emotionally, and what helped your loved one most?
* Any equipment or home adjustments I might not know about that could help her live more comfortably?

I just want to do everything I can while I still have her. I feel scared, helpless, and like I‚Äôm already grieving. She‚Äôs strong and doesn‚Äôt like to cry, so I try to stay strong too but I‚Äôm breaking inside. I would really appreciate any advice or shared experiences.",2,1743785008.0,lungcancer,2,1.0,False

A simply spectacular, historic, hand-made primitive sign pointing people toward the first publicly attended Ken Kesey Acid Test in late 1965, at which the Grateful Dead performed live for the very first time, ever, under that new name (changed from the Warlocks). The date was Saturday night, December 4, 1965, the city was San Jose, California and the location was... just somebody's house. But the Dead played, and Heritage has wonderful provenance to support this out-of-this-world poster. Namely, an interview with the high school girls who fetched the poster that night, now in their 70's.

This innocent crayon-drawn sign, surely created by a Merry Prankster, simply and mysteriously reads, ""Can you pass the Acid Test?"" and then gives an address: ""38 S. 5th St."" But it likely wasn't just posted around town, because virtually nobody would come. No, local Stanford graduate student Kesey and the Pranksters targeted people pouring out of two Rolling Stones concerts in San Jose (see the next lot for that poster). Their Acid Test was taking place in a large residential house less than a mile away. Walking distance! There were two Stones concerts that night, so what a perfect target audience to recruit party animals from... probably exiting the hall around 9:00 PM and then again at 11:30-ish. But that's OK, because the Acid Test went until around 3:00 AM.

So how did this poster happen to get saved? It's not exactly an artifact that many would think to hang on to. Well, Heritage was able to speak on the record with the two sisters who were right there on the scene, and who saved this poster along with other artifacts. We're not using their last names nor showing their present-day faces to honor their request for privacy.

It all starts when younger sister Betsy was taking guitar lessons from none other than a young Bob Weir at a local guitar shop in the Palo Alto/Menlo Park area on the San Francisco peninsula (see photo). The ladies remember it best as Guitars Unlimited in Menlo Park, right down from Santa Cruz Avenue.

""We were in high school,"" Betsy tells Heritage. ""My girlfriend's Mom was a real estate agent in downtown Menlo Park. And her place of work was around the corner from this music shop. So us being curious teenagers, we went around to this music shop, and found out they were giving guitar lessons. And that was Bob Weir. They were the Warlocks at that point.""

The Warlocks played at Magoo's Pizza Parlor in Menlo Park starting in May 1965. As older sister Kathy tells Heritage, ""The first time he [Weir] told my sister that he was going to be playing there that night. So we went, loved the music and just kept going."" Kathy, who was a high school junior or senior, saw the Warlocks a lot more than Betsy, who was a freshman or sophomore.

And how's this for a twist: ""We were very disappointed when they changed their name,"" Kathy adds with a knowing grin. ""We knew them as the Warlocks, and didn't want them to change.""

But right after the name change came the San Jose Acid Test on December 4, 1965. But ultimately, despite driving there, the sisters couldn't bring themselves to go in. ""We got there that night, but then the Merry Pranksters showed up. We were very innocent, and mainly wanted to go for the music. So we got a little spooked and left. But my sister took two of the hand-drawn signs that said 'Can You Pass the Acid Test.' I kind of remember [the poster] on a telephone pole... but again, this was a long time ago. But I think it was."" (This Heritage offering is for the poster; the other one she's referring to is smaller in size, what we'd call a handbill, which you can detect in our photo.)

Why didn't Kathy go to one of the Stones concerts at the San Jose Civic Auditorium, we wondered? ""Because they were going to be at this party!,"" she recalls with a laugh. ""That's what we had heard. I think Bob Weir had told Betsy they [the Stones] were going to be at the party. So hey - we were just going to see them there. But then it all just got to be too much.""

We also like the way Kathy puts it in her accompanying Letter of Provenance, which is included with this lot: ""The first Acid Test [Bob Weir had] told us about was in San Jose. A group of us went down there because we thought the Rolling Stones, who were playing [in] San Jose, were going to be at the Acid Test. We arrived there and were a little intimidated by all the people. Just as we were arriving, Ken Kesey's bus pulled up and a bunch of Merry Pranksters piled out and went inside. We were still in high school, and too nervous to go in. Before leaving, my sister ran across the street and took down a hand-drawn poster to bring back with her, [as well as] another smaller one laying on the ground.""

It's unknown how many people showed up for this unknown entity called an Acid Test, but in his famous book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, author Tom Wolfe estimated about 400. Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman has said in his books that Keith Richards and Brian Jones dropped by, and future Rolling Stone magazine publisher Jann Wenner has stated he was there. Meanwhile the newly christened Dead set up their equipment in various adjacent rooms, and provided the soundtrack to the multi-media craziness that were the Acid Tests.

To explain exactly what an Acid Test was, we love the way the Grateful Dead: The Illustrated History coffee-table book explained them: ""The dozen or so Acid Tests were held around the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Oregon between December 1965 and October 1966. Admission was a dollar, which got you a paper cup to dip into the celebrated Kool-Aid, and the party typically went on until dawn. Neal Cassady often served as a ringmaster of sorts, while the Kens - Kesey and Babbs - overlaid their own cosmic rap. Pranksters 'played' the Thunder Machine, and no Acid Test was complete without movie projectors, microphones, tape recorders and various sound-manipulating devices feeding into and out of the PA.""

Wolfe's Kool-Aid book nicely explains how this big, random house was selected for the historic event: ""For three or four days the Pranksters searched for a hall in San Jose and couldn't come up with one - naturally. It really seemed natural, and almost right, that nothing should be definite until the last minute. [So] at the last minute, Kesey talked a local boho figure known as Big Nig into letting them use his old hulk of a house."" (The Urban Dictionary defines ""boho"" as ""socially unconventional; bohemian."")

""Kesey had hooked up with a rock 'n' roll group, the Grateful Dead,"" Wolfe continues. ""So they move PigPen's Hammond electric organ into Big Nig's ancient house, plus all of the Dead's and Pranksters' electrified equipment.""

So it wasn't like the Dead showed up on a raised stage and everyone gathered around to watch; not at all. As Jerry Garcia told Jann Wenner in a Rolling Stone interview years later, ""It was in a house, right after the Stones concert, the same night. We went there and played but... you know, shit, our equipment filled the room, damn near, and we were like really loud and there were guys freakin' out, and there were hundreds and hundreds of people all around, in this residential neighborhood, swarming out of this guy's house.

""So our trip with the Acid Test was to be able to play long and loud. Man, we can play long and loud, as long and loud as we wanted and nobody would stop us.""

Garcia also told journalist Gene Sculatti, ""Every person was a participant and everywhere was the stage. We didn't have to entertain anybody. We were no more famous than anyone else.""

The Dead were so fresh to their new name that only one month earlier, on November 3, they had recorded six demos for Tom Donahue's Autumn Records under the name of... hang on for this... ""The Emergency Crew."" Wow!

We asked Kathy if she, Betsy and their friends ever thought the Warlocks would break through to the big-time. ""No,"" she replied firmly but with a laugh. ""We were in high school, just loved the music and dancing... we didn't see the big picture then.""

In conclusion, the phrase ""a piece of rock 'n' roll history"" gets tremendously overused in today's collectors' world, but if it ever applied to a piece that Heritage has ever offered, this would have to be in our top five items... ever.

First time or two, I hit the reset button and all was good. But it keeps happening. 

One time, I noticed it's been a bit rainy lately and thought maybe there was an outlet on the outside of the house that water was getting into. Can't find one out there. No signs of water ingress anywhere in the house either to be causing this intermittent problem. 

The part that's confusing me though is when I decided to unplugged and plugged the devices back in without resetting the outlet, and they work. They will not come back to life on their own, so it's not like the outlet is simply losing power and regaining it or anything like that. The outlet remains hot, but the items plugged in lose functionality. We've moved the items to other outlets and this is not a problem, and have also plugged in known-good items into this questionable outlet and the problem repeats itself, so it's been troubleshot to the outlet. 

While I'm pretty handy around the house, electrical is admittedly my weak point. I cannot think of any reason devices would stop working while the outlet remains hot, and then by plugging back in and not resetting, the work once more.

I hope my review helps.

From April 2023 0 -> B2 Dec 2024 while working a full time job and having a life

My partner is native and his family speaks only German, so I am in for a treat every coffee and dinner, so you understand my motivation is intertwined with desperation, I am also looking for a job here in Germany after immigrating from my Eastern European home and quitting my job and confort zone in the name of love.

My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day.

Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.

What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:

Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.

3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.

4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.

5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.

As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.

If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link(with discount code): [https://www.l16sh94jd.com/BK76FN/55M6S/?\_\_efq=Jra9uagPp9Rnev2\_qdXL1-9wpMHMUeNa1qll772BMvA](https://www.l16sh94jd.com/BK76FN/55M6S/?__efq=Jra9uagPp9Rnev2_qdXL1-9wpMHMUeNa1qll772BMvA)

I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.

No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a free 30 mins presentation from my account of their possibilities and my honest B1.2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",1,1743784699.0,DuolingoFrench,0,1.0,False

If I got an OL machine, the Lungo size would be somewhere between the size of the gran lungo and double espresso right?

I've been having a strange phenomenon in the last three days. Everytime I have a few sips of Walmart brand Starbucks cold brew: My lower left cheek, closer to my mouth and my jaw, goes numb. I was just downing 3 cups of this stuff a month ago no problem. Took a two day break from any caffeinated coffee. Now this. I feel horrible as I'm writing this. Pain and tingling in left arm. Tingling and sharp nerve pain radiating everywhere including my toes. Tightness in left arm. Don't want to go the er because the EkG always comes out normal. I'm having the worst anxiety rn. This morning I was sipping on it pretty vigorously but I'm nowhere near close to being done. I just put it away because I'm not going to risk it. 

I am a female. 29 years old. 5'6"". 138 lbs. On hydroxyzine 25 mg twice a day 12 hours apart. Partake in medical cannabis concentrate from a vape. I only vape at night before bed and never without waiting an hour for hydroxizine to kick in, or else I feel like I'm seizing out. Horrible reaction if I have them at the same time. Newly diagnosed with Graves disease. My anti bodies have been through the roof for over three and a half years. I was just having three cups of this iced coffee per day a month ago.

I didn't even realise I had a migraine until I rolled out of bed, turned on my bathroom light and realised I couldn't open my right eye. It was almost glued shut.

Then it hit me. All at once. Dull, throbbing pain behind my right eye, nausea, and then, of course, I threw up. A lot. Vomiting is never a pleasant experience, but it's medieval torture when you have a migraine. The pressure in your head is almost indescribable and unlike most illnesses, vomiting doesn't relieve migraine \[at least for me\]. It intensifies it.

I staggered to the kitchen and smashed several teacups while retrieving my pot of Sumatriptan. 2x 50mg down the hatch then wandered back to bed and prayed for sleep. That was nine hours ago. I just woke up and made a cup of coffee. Most of the pain is gone but I'm still unsteady on my feet and the vision in my right eye is still only about 30%. 

The best part? I forgot to call in sick to work. As many of you will know, when you're deep in the clutches of a migraine, the ONLY thing on your mind is trying to escape the pain. 

So now on Monday I need to have the 'but it's only a headache' conversation and resist the urge to go postal on anyone who suggests I just 'take a paracetamol' and push through next time a migraine hits.",46,1743783762.0,migraine,8,0.99,False

He is a lot older than me and also married. Our relationship has always been kinda odd. We have a lot of banter and harmless flirting. We went out lastnight for a catch up.. just me and him. A setting we‚Äôve never really been in before. It was more personal and back to our normal dynamic.. flirty comments etc. But last night, there was a lot of longing looks with eachother and his eyes were looking at me different. He made a lot of comments. I was dressed up quite nice and his attention was on my legs and breasts quite a lot. I was looking at myself in the car window to check I looked okay before we went into the pub and he said ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry.. you look beautiful‚Äô.

1jrfxdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonomicon/comments/1jrfxdg/n_is_for_nazi_economics/,N is for Nazi Economics,"**Nazi Economics**

Nazi economics was a blood splattered house of cards‚Äîstacked fast, stacked high, and doomed to collapse. It was never about sustainable prosperity or genuine recovery‚Äîit was a temporary illusion powered by military expansion, forced labor, looted wealth, and media control. The system was inherently unsustainable, ethically bankrupt, and structurally fascist.

On paper, it looked like a miracle: unemployment dropped from 6 million in 1933 to under 1 million by 1939. But only if you ignore the fine print: women were pushed out of the workforce to raise children as future cannon fodder; Jews were barred from most professions; and millions were absorbed into conscription, state-sponsored ‚Äúmake-work‚Äù projects‚Äîlike the macho but largely unnecessary Autobahn‚Äîor outright militarization.

Of course, numbers don‚Äôt lie‚Äîunless they‚Äôre dressed in uniform.

By 1939, 23% of Germany‚Äôs GDP was going to the military‚Äîa steroid injection with a ticking clock. And that steroid came with side effects: inflationary pressure was mounting, foreign reserves were drying up, and domestic consumption was stagnating.¬†

The Nazis cooked the books with creative accounting, hiding military expenditures in layers of bureaucracy and shadow budgeting that even some insiders couldn‚Äôt fully track. The illusion of prosperity depended on strict media control, fabricated statistics, and the absence of dissent.

Critics were silenced not just by propaganda, but by prison. Economic truth was an enemy of the state.

In Nazi Germany, the financial winners included industrialists, military elites, and party insiders who reaped vast rewards. Steel magnates and arms makers bankrolled Hitler early and were paid back handsomely through state contracts and the use of slave labor. Companies fattened their bottom lines by leasing concentration camp laborers from the SS at bargain rates. High-ranking Wehrmacht officers were bribed with tax breaks, estates, and cash to reward loyalty to Hitler, while SS elites enriched themselves through the plunder of Jewish property and occupied territories. Government ministries, especially Finance, played middleman‚Äîseizing assets then laundering them into public wealth.

The Nazi economy was shaped by a coalition of technocrats, ideologues, and profiteers who fused authoritarian control with industrial ambition. Schacht, a banker, gave Hitler his illusion of solvency, covering up the true extent of the military spend. Speer made the machine run faster, smoother, deadlier‚Äîfactories running on slave labor, bombs falling as output rose. Funk sat at the Reichsbank and counted the stolen gold. Meanwhile, the industrialists did not plan it, but they knew how to profit. They met the regime halfway, then asked for more. Profits didn‚Äôt just enrich the elite; they also bought silence and support from ordinary citizens whose living standards were propped up by systemic plunder.

Why import coffee when you can invent a cheaper lie? And who needs coffee when you have Pervitin meth pills at home for both military and civilians? Ersatz coffee was made from roasted acorns, chicory, or other fillers. Ersatz goods are counterfeit comforts‚Äîcheap substitutes made to mimic plenty in a system built on scarcity and spin. Under fascism, human pleasure is expendable; war-readiness is paramount. Autarky is an economic system aimed at national self-sufficiency by minimizing reliance on foreign trade‚Äîsynthetic rubber, counterfeit coffee. It favored high tarrifs and quotas for inputs, with domestic substitutes encouraged.

Nazi propaganda framed their policies as a nationalist virtue, a closed-loop economy. Imports were slashed, but not abandoned‚Äîautarky was less a policy than a performance. Behind the curtains, they traded actively and selectively, maintaining strategic trade relationships‚Äîeven with its future enemies. American firms like IBM, General Motors, and Coca-Cola stayed in business to varying degrees in the 1930s. Some companies have been accused of helping optimize Nazi operations‚Äîfrom census-taking to supply chains. Companies deny any wrongdoing.¬†

Free enterprise? Smothered. The Third Reich didn‚Äôt merely regulate the economy‚Äîit shackled it. Small businesses, once the pride of German industriousness, were obliterated; by 1936, a third had vanished. Consumer goods evaporated from store shelves as the economy retooled for militarism. Though it appeared to preserve private ownership and market mechanisms, the Nazi economy was functionally a command system. Business owners became ‚Äúshop managers‚Äù who retained the formalities of enterprise‚Äîhiring, selling, borrowing‚Äîbut followed strict state directives. The economic ministry dictated what to produce, where to buy, to whom to sell, and at what price. Wages, prices, and interest rates were all set from above, rendering market exchange a fa√ßade. Behind the illusion of capitalism, every transaction was a government order in disguise.

Small farmers under the Nazi regime were both idolized and exploited. Propaganda painted them as the backbone of the Volk‚Äîthe noble peasant safeguarding German blood and soil (Blut und Boden). But in practice, they were locked into a rigid system of state quotas, price controls, and forced deliveries that stripped them of autonomy. The Hereditary Farm Law of 1933 froze farms in family lines, forbidding their sale to non-family or division, effectively turning farmers into feudal serfs on their own land. The Party told them what to grow. Inputs like fertilizer and machinery were diverted to industrial and military uses, and food requisitioning left many rural communities under-supplied. Romanticized in posters, rationed in reality‚Äîsmall farmers were another cog in the machine, praised loudly and squeezed dry.

Propaganda told farmers and workers that being overworked and underpaid wasn‚Äôt unfair‚Äîit was patriotic.

On May 2, 1933‚Äîjust one day after Labor Day celebrations meant to lull the masses‚ÄîNazi stormtroopers raided union offices across Germany, seizing assets and arresting organizers. The message was unmistakable: worker solidarity would either be repurposed for nationalist obedience or eradicated. The newly formed German Labor Front, which supplanted all independent unions, didn‚Äôt negotiate wages or protect workers. Instead, it orchestrated mass rallies, mandated morale-boosting holidays, and published glossy magazines praising the dignity of labor‚Äîwhile silencing any voice that dared question factory conditions. Labor became loyalty, or else.

The Front was pure theater‚Äîa simulacrum of worker representation, stripped of rights and bargaining power. Workers were no longer citizens with agency but tools of the state. And when labor ceases to serve its own interests‚Äîwhen it becomes loyalty instead of livelihood‚Äîyou no longer have an economy. You have a cult.

The ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù? Austria and Czechoslovakia were looted to prop up Hitler‚Äôs books‚Äîfactories stripped, gold seized, resources redirected. As the Reich expanded, so did its economic appetite. Poland was ransacked‚Äîits agricultural output redirected to feed German soldiers and civilians, its industries cannibalized. France was bled dry through occupation costs, forced loans, and systematic plunder of its art, gold reserves, and industrial goods. Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark were similarly drained, their economies warped to serve the Nazi war machine. In the East, the looting turned genocidal. The Soviet Union‚Äôs occupied territories were stripped of grain, oil, and raw materials, often leaving local populations to starve. Ukraine was gutted for its wheat; mines in the Donbas fueled German industry. Even Greece, small and impoverished, was squeezed for every drachma, triggering famine.

Slave labor was the engine of the Nazi economy. By 1944, nearly eight million forced laborers worked within the Reich‚Äîaccounting for more than 20% of the entire German workforce. Most were civilians dragged from occupied Eastern Europe, especially Poland and the Soviet Union, though others came from France, the Netherlands, and even Italy after its surrender. About half were women, many of whom endured not only brutal labor but also systematic sexual abuse. Jews, Roma, political prisoners, and other persecuted groups were enslaved in camps where survival was often measured in weeks. Starved, beaten, and worked to death, they kept German industry alive while General Winter turned German soldiers into frozen scarecrows on the Eastern Front.

After the war, several American companies that had operated in Nazi Germany‚Äîsome with troubling pre-war ties to the regime‚Äîreceived compensation from the U.S. government for wartime damages. These firms, including giants like Ford and General Motors, had built factories in Germany before the war that were later repurposed by the Nazis for military production.

When Allied bombing raids destroyed those assets, the companies filed claims‚Äînot against Germany, but with the U.S. government under wartime insurance programs. In a twist of capitalist irony, they were reimbursed for damages to facilities that, during the war, had been producing vehicles and parts for the enemy.

Profits under fascism. Payouts under democracy.

Moral disengagement is the mental sleight of hand that lets people do bad things without feeling bad. It‚Äôs a psychological exit ramp from conscience‚Äîa way to dodge guilt by rewriting the script. Harm is reframed as necessary, blame is outsourced, victims are dehumanized, and suddenly, the villain feels like the hero. Slavery, theft, and occupation were framed as necessary for national greatness. Citizens were encouraged to view expropriated goods, jobs, and resources as ‚Äúreclaimed‚Äù or deserved, absolving them of guilt.

Groupthink greased the gears of Nazi economics as much as steel and stolen gold. Groupthink refers to the social dynamic where individuals suppress dissenting opinions for the sake of cohesion or perceived unity. Dissent didn‚Äôt just vanish‚Äîit was metabolized into conformity. In a system where questioning the plan made you an enemy of the people, consensus wasn‚Äôt earned; it was enforced.

 Authority bias turned uniforms into truth and orders into moral absolution‚Äîif the F√ºhrer willed it, it must be right. This short-circuits ethical deliberation. *Obedience becomes a virtue*, not a weakness. System justification theory filled in the gaps, convincing citizens that their sacrifice and suffering was orderly, necessary‚Äîeven virtuous. People defended the regime not despite its cruelty, but because they‚Äôd been conditioned to believe the system was just, the economy strong, and the prophesied future near.

There is a clear warning here about the dangers of centralizing economic and political power, erasing labor rights under the guise of unity, cloaking plunder as patriotism, and turning human beings into fuel for ideological machines.

Conquest was the business model. It was never sustainable. When expansion stalled‚Äîand the tanks stopped rolling‚Äîthe engine seized. By the early 1940s, the Nazi economy was running on fumes, forced labor, and delusion. It ended in fantasy, fire, and fiscal suicide.

1jrfuls,https://theshtf.app,Origin Story,"In 2024, a **former Microsoft anthropologist** who‚Äôd spent a decades studying human behavior and societal trends, couldn‚Äôt ignore the cracks anymore. She‚Äôd seen it all‚Äîglobal supply chain failures, escalating natural disasters, and a digital world teetering on the edge of chaos. Her years dissecting how civilizations adapt (or fail to) told her one thing: the world was shifting faster than people could keep up. But she wasn‚Äôt one to just sit back and watch.

She turned to her husband, a grizzled **Microsoft engineer** with a knack for building secure resiliant systems. Over late-night coffee in their kitchen, she laid it out: ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt ready. They need something practical, something real‚Äînot just another tech toy.‚Äù He, who‚Äôd spent years coding solutions for corporate giants, saw the challenge in her eyes. He was in.

Together, they dreamed up **The SHTF App**‚Äîa prepper app born from her deep understanding of human survival instincts and his tech wizardry. It wasn‚Äôt about doomsday bunkers or tinfoil hats. It was about **empowering regular people**‚Äîparents, small-business owners, even city dwellers like them‚Äîto take control in a world that felt increasingly out of it. She mapped out the psychology: what people need to feel secure, what they‚Äôd overlook in a crisis. He built the guts: real-time alerts, offline resource guides, and a community feature to connect preppers without the paranoia.

The tipping point came in early 2025. A freak storm knocked out power across the Pacific Northwest for a week and Los Angeles Firestorm leveled two cities. Friends who‚Äôd laughed at their ‚Äúprepper talk‚Äù were suddenly texting: ‚ÄúHow do I purify water?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best backup heat source?‚Äù ""How do I protect my home against fire?"" They had answers‚Äîbecause The SHTF App had.

Now, they‚Äôre on a mission: to **make preparedness as common as a weather app on your phone**. ‚ÄúThe state of the world isn‚Äôt a conspiracy,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wake-up call.‚Äù he adds, ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre here to make sure you‚Äôre not fumbling in the dark when it rings.‚Äù",1,1743783453.0,theshtfapp,0,1.0,False

I was having coffee with some buddies this week (reasonably switched on and educated group) and one of them were on about how they believe Smith‚Äôs long game is to become the next US state. 

It hit me - sort of right between the eyes. What if TBA‚Äôs long game (cause we all know the bobble head isn‚Äôt making the plan) is to get a larger number of seats in parliament? If they‚Äôve learnt from QC they know they can‚Äôt separate (AB would strand BC similar to QC stranding the maritimes) but they probably have also realized this game of ‚Äúwe‚Äôll take our ball and go home‚Äù has an expiration date. 
1. Attack the pension plan - whole some Albertans are in favour the vast majority realize what a mess this would be. 
2. Provincial police - how are we going to stand up a law enforcement group anywhere near the value of the RCMP without spending massive money (see point #1). 
3. Sucking up to rightwing American politicians and pundits - again selling the misdirect. 

I now believe that they want to put the screws to Ottawa and force them to give Alberta (they don‚Äôt care about anyone else) more seats in parliament to try to break the ON/QC lock on votes. If they‚Äôre clever they‚Äôll point out that Carney will win based on that block alone. 

I hate conspiracies but I can‚Äôt shake this one. 

PS - if I disappear TBA has buried me in the backyard for breaking this story. ",20,1743783426.0,alberta,35,0.8,False

My partner and I have been together nearly 2 years he seems to be saying more and more lately how he feels unsupported. 


He has childhood trauma and abandonment wounds. He is a musician and lives an hour and a half train journey from me. 90% of my weekends I pay ¬£30 train fare to travel to him because he normally has a gig somewhere near where he lives. By default I'm helping him load and unload the car for gigs.

He has ADHD and struggles to keep his house tidy. So there's obviously the typical 50/50 you cook I'll wash up things sure. Which we do. Twice in our relationship I have spent hours and hours tidying his whole house from top to bottom, folding clothes, putting them away, washing dishes, putting things back in bags etc. in this time he has been getting ready/practicing for gigs etc. 

He regularly says how he feels like he needs a parent figure to swoop in and help, like he needs so much help and someone living with him would help him be accountable yet says he knows that would be unhealthy with a partner. But he does want to live together. 

I have also spent hours doing free art for posters. Helping him with make up looks, validating and taking pictures of new outfits. Staying up late doing this. (We both have fun doing the make up part but a lot of validation and pics of him). I've also dyed his hair, he had never done that before. I have also written out a couple of to do lists for him. Once we were in a cafe and he had his laptop, I didn't realise I was meant to be helping him, I randomly mentioned that I felt tired. He went quiet, didn't like the noise in the cafe etc. Later on he said how the child in him feels like it doesn't matter if I'm tired, when someone needs support and help you support them. I said why don't we set aside a time for me to help you and we can go through everything you need to do together. This bothered him and he said everything is always put off to a later date. That he has done that all his life. That he needed the support right now. But I had no idea how to do that. He says that he is so good at supporting others but noone supports him. Noone cares. Obviously when I've done any of these things he's always really, greatful, says thank you etc. 

He has particularly struggled at times and talking through It all and saying he needs support, he needs someone to be enthusiastic about what he does. Anything less than that and he feels like he might as well not bother. He has also admitted he really struggles to manage and handle any disappointments. 

I suggested to  him putting whiteboards up and he said he already had tried that but can't bring himself to use them (ADHD) I said what if I message you every morning and ask you to tick something off/write something on? He said yeah but will you actually do that, though?

His mum paid for a PA for him and he complained and said it's sad someone needs to be paid in order for him to feel supported. If the pa doesn't have much time he gets sad and says he feels unsupported. 

He's worried about money, I offered to help him look for a temporary job while he's doing this. He said he needed to just be sad and that that wasn't helpful and he needed to just be held and supported emotionally first before suggestions. Before when I've not made suggestions, he has felt unsupported because I wasn't offering suggestions.

Maybe I am not as excitable and jumping up and down with joy enough for him at every turn. I have definitely been like this with new outfits/make up but I'm often tired from my own job and weekends and maybe don't sound enthusiastic enough about his new ideas I don't know. Is there any realistic way to actually help him to feel supported?

He says how much he does for me, makes me endless cups of tea, buys or makes coffees in the mornings, cooks (i also cook for us), drives me to work (only from his if he is also working nearby or if he stays at mine and it's a ten min drive from there) that's all great and fair enough but I have never asked for any of those things. I hate relying on others and get on with doing what I do. He says he feels like a lost little boy.

TLDR boyfriend repeatedly saying how he feels unsupported and can't handle disappointments. Says feels like a lost little boy. We both do things for each other. Not sure how to help him with this
