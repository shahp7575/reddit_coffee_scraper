this morning i woke up w alllll the motivation (you know when ur brain tricks u like ‚Äútoday we are Productive‚Ñ¢‚Äù). i made coffee, opened my laptop... and then somehow its 3pm and i realized i spent 5 hours reorganizing every single file folder on my desktop instead of doing the actual assignment due tonight.

fine. deep breath. not the end of the world. so i tell myself ‚Äújust heat up waffles, eat something quick so u can focus‚Äù. but then i open freezer, see the waffles, and have a 20-min mental battle about whether they¬†*taste freezer-burnt or just normal*¬†and then decide idk, and somehow im now on the floor eating shredded cheese from the bag bc waffles felt ‚Äútoo complicated.‚Äù

like HOW. how do simple tasks snowball into a full dramatic saga in my brain. one second i‚Äôm writing an essay, next second i‚Äôm a goblin sniffing a frozen waffle like it‚Äôs fine wine.

I just added my first beta users to the prototype (via TestFlight).

I paid a developer to build it. He works full time and did this on the side. Not only is he an amazing developer, but what I value most is he‚Äôs an amazing person. I asked if he‚Äôd like equity and the role of CTO, but he‚Äôs risk-averse (understandably) and declined. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to leave his job, but still, it‚Äôs not for him.

I also had an awful experience with a UX/UI designer who claimed to be very experienced in startups. At first, he seemed incredible and I thought he might be a potential partner. Then he started acting out and quickly became a nightmare to work with, so I fired him.

Because of that, I‚Äôm now hesitant to bring on a stranger (my close friends work blue-collar jobs, so they‚Äôre not in this world). The last thing I want is to give someone equity, even with vesting, and then have the relationship/venture blow up.

I don‚Äôt feel I need a partner right now, but I want to start pitching to investors, and everything I‚Äôve heard says investors like teams. I recently met someone through Y Combinator‚Äôs Co-Founder Matching. He‚Äôs experienced and seems like a good person, but anyone can make a good impression over coffee. He is someone I am thinking about asking to join. 

So here‚Äôs my question:
-What should I do?
-How do you protect yourself when bringing on a stranger? I know vesting helps, but is there anything else?
-Should I push harder with the developer I already work with?
-Do I actually need a team to pitch?

I'll mention some details below and if anyone is interested then I'll think about moving forward with it. 

I'm a graphic designer. I don't have experience in designing assets for episode stories but I want to give this a try and see if it goes anywhere. I work with softwares such as photoshop, illustrator and can a. 

‚Ä¢ first of all let me mention the stuff I can try to do - (1) overlays for food etc (but NOT body parts because I have not done anything similar to that before). (2) templates for mini games, buttons and other screens/backgrounds which you may require. (3) any other design related help you might need, anything except for body part overlays.

‚Ä¢ it will be a donation based service which means there won't be any fixed charges. If you're a young writer and can't afford to buy, this will be beneficial to you, ofcourse it won't be limited to just young ones. I have buy me a coffee account so you can donate whatever amount you can so basically it's a free service in a way. 

‚Ä¢ how will it work? You will have to give me details about your story, characters, what kind of stuff you want to be designed and how you have visualised it (colors, fonts, objects, etc). I'll make 2 or 3 variations and it will be open for any changes and revisions. To keep it easy, I won't be taking more than 1-2 project at a time. I will let you know how many days I will require beforehand. And don't worry, we will be communicating on Instagram, not here, I'm just not keen on sharing my Id in a public post so if you reach out in my dm here, I will share my insta Id then and you will be able to see my design work too. 

‚Ä¢ communication is the key üóùÔ∏è, more clearer you are more easy it will be for me to deliver the designs you have envisioned. 

‚Ä¢ I'm sure you must be curious as to why I'm offering this basically for free? Firstly, this is my way of supporting authors when I fall short on with donating gems. Secondly, as I mentioned above that I'm a graphic designer, this is completely different than the work I do professionally (which is branding and social media posts), this will a fun way for me to try out new things and learn stuff while making it more meaningful (since I will be helping out authors). 

‚Ä¢ lastly, please do not take this as something to misuse, I genuinely want to help out, learn things and maybe earn something too.

I'm back with another tale from the graveyard shift at a convience store. This is something that happened over a course of 2 or 3 weeks, give or take.

I was in the middle of refilling the coffee beans in the coffee machines when a kid with curly hair and a girl who'd I'd assumed is his girlfriend came in. The girl walked suspiciously close to the beer cooler while the guy walked up to me and claimed he needed a band aid and asked if I could grab him one from the first aid kit. 

I went to the first aid kit in the back area to grab him one and got it back to him. He thanked me and walked out while out of the corner of my eye, I saw the girl just walk out with two 12 packs of Twisted Teas behind him. They took off running the moment they exited the store.

I can't believe I fell for that. Well, the two dumb kids try coming in again a week or two later. Tried the same routine. The guy asked if I could grab him a Bandaid while the girl was suspiciously close to the beer cooler. 

Well, I didn't fall for it this time. I told him I wouldn't be giving him a bandaid and that he and his girlfriend could leave. I kept a very close eye on him and the girl to make sure they didn't try snagging anything on their way out. My guess is they didn't think I would recognize them from the first time and hadn't seen them steal that time as well. 

Well, about an hour after that, the idiots tried coming back in again. I was working on baking the cookies when I heard the little door chime we had on the beer cooler go off. I honestly didn't really think anything of it. I thought initially it was just an actual customer coming in to buy some booze. 

But then when I saw the kid walk out of the beer cooler carrying a pack of White Claws and Twisted Teas, I knew that wasn't the case. As he was walking towards the door, I stormed up to him and told him to give me the packs of booze and that he could leave.

He tried to convince me that he was going to pay for them but I knew that wasn't true. I admittedly probably shouldn't have said this but I said "" Sure you are. Now, give me those White Claws and Twisted Teas and get the hell out."" He gave them back and reluctantly left.

I spent a good amount of time looking at different options, testing them out, and reading up on reviews. The best one to come out of all that research is the [MuellerLiving French Press](https://econsumerproductreviews.com/dp-B07JGBK6XV). The 34oz size is perfect for making a decent amount of coffee without being too bulky, and the double insulation keeps your coffee hot for a good while. One of the things I like is how versatile it is‚Äînot just for coffee, but you can also use it for tea or hot chocolate if you're in the mood for something different.

The design is pretty straightforward, and the 4-level filtration system makes sure that your coffee doesn‚Äôt have a bunch of grounds floating around. It‚Äôs also super easy to clean, which is a huge plus, especially if you're not into spending too much time maintaining it.

I did look into a few other options like the Bodum or Secura French presses. The Bodum is great, but it‚Äôs kinda fragile, and Secura‚Äôs good for durability but doesn‚Äôt have the same insulation, so your coffee cools off faster. So it‚Äôs a bit of a trade-off.

1nid4qw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nid4qw,[Product Request] F33 Need Skincare Advice on a Budget,"Firstly, I never posted on any skincare reddits because I have been so terrified people will make fun of my skin and looks but I *need* to learn to ask for help or I‚Äôll never get help and only get worse.

So‚Ä¶I have NO idea what the hell I‚Äôm doing and have NO knowledge on skincare, AT ALL so treat me like it‚Äôs an eli5. I also listed out a few things I think might help with deducing what products I should use. I suspect the BHA acid thing from Paula‚Äôs Choice might be drying my skin out REALLY bad as you can see in the photos I attached. After the photos I moisturized and it looked a LOT less dry and frail. But I‚Äôll let the experts here determine rather than me guessing.

# ¬†History/Information:

**‚ô¶ I am in the process of losing weight rapidly (Hopefully)**  
I‚Äôm exercising and eating healthier, but am still learning how to prepare a nutritious diet without falling back into disorderly eating. So I have NO idea if I am getting adequate vitamins until I can figure that out I plan on using multivitamins. Any cheap recommendations for vitamins/collagen would be immensely appreciated.

**‚ô¶ Going to get bloodwork done**  
This will tell me if it‚Äôs hormonal/vitamin problems which I hear can REALLY mess your skin up royally and will provide more answers. For the meantime though, until that happens I just wanna see what y‚Äôall think.

**‚ô¶ Use-to-be sidesleeper**  
I‚Äôm working on sleeping on my back now due to seeing asymmetry in my face (nose/resting mouth) hoping that it‚Äôll help go back to normal or something or if y‚Äôall know of any shapers/exercises I could do to help fix the crookedness. (Do nose cartilage straighteners work over long periods of time or are those a sham?)

**‚ô¶ I am trying to drink up to 2L of water a day**  
Sometimes I forget (AuDHD) but I assume missing a day or two of intake wouldn‚Äôt cause my skin to look immediately haggard or maybe I‚Äôm ignorant and it really does affect it that much.

**‚ô¶ I was a smoker for 7 years, in those last few years a heavy chain smoker.**  
I am now 1 year nicotine free cold turkey.

**‚ô¶ Didn‚Äôt wear sunscreen. Ever.**  
I came from a borderline homeless environment and those negligent habits of not buying sunscreen (Seen as a luxury/pointless when you can‚Äôt buy food) bled into my entire 20s leaving my skin not taken care of ever in the sun.

Good thing is though: once I could, I became kind of a locked inside-the-house gamer, so despite not wearing sunscreen ever, I almost never was outside to begin with. And I mean to levels of that of a hikikomori. But I had instances of wanting to fit in with beauty trends where a small handful of times (1-5???) in my life I tried tanning in the sun and got burned.

**‚ô¶ Drink a lot of caffeine**  
We‚Äôre talking like, 10 calorie energy drinks OR coffee with/without creamer. I heard this affects skin quality. Half of people say it‚Äôs horrible for skin and the other half say it‚Äôs great for skin. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs right.

**‚ô¶ Have to run dehumidifiers 24/7**  
Me and my partner live in a basement apartment, so we HAVE to run the dehumidifiers per the landlord. So this MIGHT be contributing to my skin texture. We keep the machines at 45, which online tells me it‚Äôs leaving the room with 45% humidity and that 40%-60% is the healthy range to not be too moist or too dry. But I could be wrong and maybe it‚Äôs affecting my skin.

**‚ô¶ I work graveyard shift**  
I almost never see sunlight hence why I am so pale in the pictures and sickly looking. Can‚Äôt tell if this is enhancing discoloration/dark under eyes due to contrast or translucent skin. I‚Äôm scared to be in the sun and worsening my skin, I‚Äôm acting like a total vampire lately lol

# Products I‚Äôm currently using:

I don‚Äôt have a full list for AM and PM and maybe we can work off it or find cheaper dupes so I‚Äôm not breaking the bank to keep up. Please let me know if I‚Äôm applying something wrong too. This is the order I do it.

**= CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser**  
I rub this on for a few seconds with my clean hands on a wet face and immediately wash it off. I try and do this when I wake up and go to sleep every day.

**= I'm From Rice Toner**  
I shake it and then I put a tiny bit on my clean hands and rub it on my cheeks and try and dab the leftover under my eyes. I MIGHT be doing too little, not sure.

**= Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng¬† Rejuvenating Cream**  
My sister gave me her small 5mL pot. I take my finger and poke the product so that a small amount is on my finger (To conserve it) so I‚Äôm probably not using enough, but anyway I poke dots of the product all over my skin and gently rub it in. I use this whenever I get antsy, so it‚Äôs very‚Ä¶flip floppy. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm suppose to use it AM and PM or‚Ä¶?

Someone on here from a post a long time ago said you can get it for cheaper on Stylevana but I have NO idea if they‚Äôre legit so any input on that would be great otherwise any dupes that work too would be so appreciated.

**= Paula‚Äôs Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**  
My sister also gave me this and I read to use it one day, skip a day, then use it the day after etc etc. Is this an AM or PM one cus I saw on here Retinol/Tretinoin HAS to be used as PM cus of sun stuff. I think maybe this is what‚Äôs making my skin look SO dried out in the pics??

**= Vaselin Intensive Care Soothing Hydration**  
And you guys can crucify me for this and I would fully understand lol, but this is what I use to moisturize my face since I don‚Äôt have an actual moisturizer, YET. Hoping to find one after this post.

# What I‚Äôm looking for:

‚ô¶ Budget friendly solutions

‚ô¶ Remove or lessen dark eye bags (Possibly iron deficiency idk we'll hopefully find out)

‚ô¶ Lessen how large/visible the pores look

‚ô¶ Remove sallow look to my entire face

‚ô¶ Lessen visible wrinkles

‚ô¶ AM/PM list of budget friendly but effective products in the order they are to be used in, how to use them, and how often to use them

I‚Äôve heard of Niacinamide serums, Tretinoin creams, Retinol, Matrixyl serums, vitamin c serums, and peptides but I have no idea what they do and what order to use them all in nor what/if they have trustworthy budget friendly products so I‚Äôm at a loss.

I just feel absolutely horrible whenever I look at my skin and the messed up part is it looks 20x worse in photos on my iPhone than in the mirror irl but all I can see are bags, dark circles, wrinkles, discolored skin, sickly...like I feel like I look HELLA older than what I am",1,1758016353.0,SkincareAddiction,4,1.0,False

Photo 1-3 are of a 440c kiritsuke blade with a black coat on top, I got it as a ""funny"" gift for a friend so I picked the most edgy item on the catalog. The handle is 3d printed in wood pla and designed to pressure fit without glues (I might still add a bit of beeswax to be safe), I initially thought of painting it with wood colors to make it more convincing but I actually love the solid coffee cream color of the unfinished handle and feel like it contrasts well with the black finish on the blade.  
The cad files for the handle are procedural so I can tweak new handles to the blade specifics and tune the weight using infill% and simple geometry changes.   
My original plan was to make a funny handle with a fish head biting the blade but it interfered with the pinch grip, now I'm considering printing a second handle with engravings on the faces and some extras.

Photo 4-6 are of an allegedly 65+HRC custom alloy blade (they claim to have added tungsten to the alloy), the handle is the cheapest handle I could grab from AliExpress, it's a bit too wide for the blade but I'll be able to fix it with glue and wax.

Both blades came functionally sharp but feel a bit too thick behind the edge, since both are gifts for friends/family I agreed with them that they'll first try them out as they are and then give them back to me for some sharpening and reprofiling if they feel like it's needed.

I mostly go alone for movies and stuff. Wondering if anyone would like to give me company this weekend? I have not planned much. Perhaps a walk in the park, a movie, coffee, watching football or the dog park.

I am not looking for dating because it‚Äôs been a while I‚Äôve been that phase üòÖ got too comfortable being single. I just needed someone to hangout with. Females are cool too!

Well last night, I was pretty stressed out by a presentation I have to do today, so just like when I was still in university, I would jack off before any stressful events and it usually works 100%. I just love that post nut clarity and calm.

Now that I'm married, instead of rubbing one out, I usually just initiate sex with my wife. We have a rule that every night for the first 5 minutes before going to sleep, we hug and kiss and then go to  our sides of the bed to sleep or if we heat up, we'd do it. 

Well tonight, she said no after hugging and kissing, she said she's tired and sleepy and it was my fault as I did not go to bed right away when she called me.( I was busy prepping my presentation). 

I tried to sleep it off but for some reason, I woke up at 12 am with a big honer and couldn't go back to sleep, I feel the pressure, I got to have a release. So I did what any normal man? Would do, I jacked off. 

Well, I was getting close when she suddenly wakes up and yelled at me, WTF are you doing? I said, I told you I need to release this shit for me to be cool tomorrow. It's my first time getting caught masturbating, and I felt shame like a teen. Lol. 

Well, surprisingly, she told me to come close to her and she'll just blow me. But I refused as my boner was totally gone. She gave this look of disgust. Lol.

Now I'm awake, having coffee, getting ready for work, but the pressure is still there. ",2,1758016005.0,AITAH,6,0.75,False

1nid0a2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nid0a2,"Stock Aeropress 1:2, 15.2g in, 30.1g out, ~9.6% TDS. This is NOT a semantics discussion. Hear me out! Help is appreciated.","I'd like to preface by saying that I'm NOT debating on what is espresso or not espresso. I've learned my lesson after posting a video with a title ""Espresso and Americano with Aeropress"" before I even got my refractometer. However, ever since I got my refractometer, I've been playing with the variables to master the brewing technique that I've developed, and I've finally been able to brew espresso-strength coffee with just Aeropress! No hard presses, no pressure, just 60s percolation. This was the tastiest shot I've ever made, so I just really want to share it!

To be transparent, I dropped my Brix refractometer, so I had to fix the scale; it's not perfectly aligned, there's a slight 0.5-1 degree angle. Also, I did not filter the coffee. I used 11.4 Brix for my calculations, but even if we were to say that it's overestimated and it's closer to 10 Brix, it is still 8.5% TDS, which is espresso-strength.

What I'd like to do is to ask you to examine the puck: how well did I managed to percolate? Was the extraction even? Can you tell that there's some channelling? I have zero experience with espresso, so I wouldn't know.
Any help is very much appreciated! I want to improve my brews before I can afford to get into espresso.

I'd also like to invite you to try out the recipe (https://youtube.com/shorts/SZ6U7m6QbH4) and compare it with your espresso! I'd like to hear your thoughts on it. The difference is that I used finer grinds (0.7 on ZP6), lower dose (15g) and ratio (1:2), as well as soaked with boiling water.

1nicyrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nicyrc/i_killed_someone_in_a_story_cops_just_found_the/,I Killed Someone in a Story. Cops just found the Body.,"I‚Äôve been a writer for quite some time now. I can still remember being a kid in elementary school and hearing my first scary story. Man, from that moment on, I was completely hooked. I looked for these stories like crack, and very quickly they became the only thing I was listening to constantly.

Naturally, already excelling at English, once I discovered these new forms of creative expression, it was only a matter of time before I tried my hand at it myself.

I felt as though I had a general grasp on what a good story should look like; I knew to pay attention to pacing, make things natural, and, most importantly, felt I knew how to paint an artful, albeit graphic picture.

That being said, I recently wrote a story regarding murder. More specifically, the murder of an elderly jogger who just so happened to be a key witness in the story. He was set to testify against some important people in court, and I was tasked with tying up some loose ends, if you know what I mean.

Listen, I was trying to write a crime novel, alright? I‚Äôm not Agatha Christie, I just figured I‚Äôd give some mystery writing a try. Anyway, I‚Äôm getting sidetracked.

Basically, as he ran his normal route, as he did every morning; I drove up about a mile ahead of him and set up some ultra-thin metal wire that stretched from one tree to another horizontally across the path. Directly at the neck level for our ‚Äúkey witness‚Äù.

As I mentioned, I was trying to write a crime novel, so I had written my character as this sort of private eye/ mercenary type deal- listen, I already told you I‚Äôm not Agatha Christie, I‚Äôm a horror writer at heart- but I say this because I made my character do research, right? I made him know his stuff is what I‚Äôm saying.

More specifically, I made him know that this elderly jogger ran at an average pace of 6 miles an hour and that his neck would be exactly 5 feet and 4 inches from the ground.

All that ‚Äúknowing‚Äù I did, yet, as I watched the jogger slam into the wire and get clotheslined to his butt, the blood wasn‚Äôt coming out at nearly the speed I thought it would.

In fact, the jogger just sat there, rubbing his neck and becoming absolutely flabbergasted as he drew his hand back from his throat revealing watery red blood coating his palm.

In a state of animalistic fear after noticing the wire, his eyes darted around wildly as he rose to his feet.

Afraid of my target's escape, I quickly jumped from the bush where I hid, waiting to take a picture of him upon the job's completion.

His eyes lit up with fear as I knocked him back down to his back, quickly analyzing the area to make sure no one was around.

As the old man struggled to get up, I unhooked the wire from one of the trees and wrapped it around his neck.

I pulled as hard as I could and heard flesh tearing and veins ripping as the man's struggling grunts turned to gurgles, and the sound of wet flopping filled the air.

Once his feet stopped kicking and his body went completely limp, I removed the wire from around his neck. He was nearly decapitated as he lay there on the vacant walking trail. The sounds of nature continued, and birds sang to the backdrop of gently trickling water from a nearby stream as the man's blood leaked further and further down the concrete.

As I said, my character had to take photos upon the job's completion, so that‚Äôs what he did.

I snapped a few shots from various angles before rolling up the wire and hurrying back to my old Volkswagen, completely covered in blood.

Again, I AM NOT A MYSTERY WRITER.

Like, I didn‚Äôt even put the effort into thinking about all the DNA evidence to be collected from the scene, the amount of witnesses that could‚Äôve been around in such a public space, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the fact that he just, what? Left the old man there on the trail for people to find and alert authorities? Fuck, man, like pick a lane, right?

See, that‚Äôs exactly what I thought too.

And that‚Äôs exactly why I DELETED that story. Moved it to the trash bin immediately after reading it, utterly ashamed of myself, I must say.

I 100 percent planned on just calling it a night, and picking up on a new horror story the next day.

As I lay in bed and drifted into sleep, it felt as though my eyes were closed for mere moments before the booming sound of knocks came thumping from my front door. Sunlight filled my room, and as I groggily made my way towards the door, the rhythmic knocking abruptly stopped.

I crept up and checked the peephole to find no one there.

When I opened the door, there wasn‚Äôt even anyone in the hallway; however, there were some Polaroid photos placed carefully on my welcome mat.

They were of the old man, exactly how I had imagined him and exactly how I‚Äôd mutilated him. All taken from the exact angles as the story.

I couldn‚Äôt even move for a brief moment as I stared down at them, disgusted at how they decorated the mat.

I quickly gathered my thoughts, however, and scooped up each of the 6 photos.

Lying them out on the coffee table, I sat down on the couch with a ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt possibly be happening‚Äù look on my face, and my head fell into my hands as the realization hit me.

I flipped on the TV and turned to the news just in time to see the headline:

KEY WITNESS IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE FOUND DEAD ON WALKING TRAIL IN ATLANTA

‚ÄúWelp,‚Äù I thought to myself. ‚ÄúIt was fun while it lasted.‚Äù

As we know, Cambodia is a one party authoritarian state cosplaying as a democracy, we could see this from the many... mishaps and misdoings of Hun Sen, the 1997 coup, 2013 false election scandals, silencing a peaceful protest using force, and also jailing or even killing opposition leaders or critics, Cambodia isnt the place you want to be in right now as a vocal critic of the government.

  
as you know, corruption runs rampant in the country and is integrated into daily life, like paying a police officer ''a little bit'' more cash to let him buy himself some coffee or get a free pass. this also severely affected roads, funding for their shitty school systems and other stuff, such as their lack luster military still using cold war era gears and wearing flip flops. Dont even mention abandoned buildings in sihanouk by greedy chinese investors who dipped after covid. All i can say is that this country is in a sad state of limbo.



However, in asia, we could notice some sort of spring happening, indonesian protests and riots about unfair bonuses , Nepalese revolution that brought down the corrupt government and instated a new one, now philipines is also on the verge of mass protests. something i like to call, the ''Asian spring'' because it bares a little bit of resemblance to the arab spring. I was wondering the chance of the protests spreading to cambodia. But note, this isnt cambodia's first time having protests.

  
2013-2014 protests in short was about a mix of electorial fraud, refusal to raise wages and a sprinkle of anti-vietnamese statement, you might ask ''but why do they hate the vietnamese? didnt they liberate them?'' well they did but the vietnamese were no heros either, check out the K5 Plan

(Taken from wikipedia)''They were angry at having to abandon their farms in order to dedicate time to clear the jungle, heavy toil they perceived as useless and unfruitful.[^(\[7\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K5_Plan#cite_note-Soizick_Crochet_1997-7)¬†Their resentment grew in time as they perceived the forced labor to be, albeit without the killings, very similar to what they had experienced under the Khmer Rouge.[^(\[8\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K5_Plan#cite_note-ReferenceB-8)¬†Owing to unsanitary conditions and the abundance of¬†[mosquitoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquitoes)¬†in areas of difficult access, badly fed and badly lodged workers on the K5 project fell victim to¬†[malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria)¬†and exhaustion.[^(\[9\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K5_Plan#cite_note-9)

Many of the mines remain to this day, making the vast area dangerous. The K5 zone became part of the great landmine problem in Cambodia after the end of the civil war. In 1990 alone, the number of Cambodians that had a leg or foot amputated as a result of an injury caused by a land mine reached around 6,000.[^(\[)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K5_Plan#cite_note-10)'', 

but in short, its because they often thought Hun sen was a vietnamese lackey (and even King sihanouk before said Hun sen was a ''One-eyed lackey of the vietnamese'') But that was besides the point. the main point for these protests happening was because of refusal to raise wages and due to alleged electorial fraud, it used to be peaceful protests but lets see here, using electric cattle prods and batons to deal with protesters, along with water cannons and even live rounds, killing 4 and injuring 27, genius move.

As I mentioned, I was trying to write a crime novel, so I had written my character as this sort of private eye/ mercenary type deal- listen, I already told you I‚Äôm not Agatha Christie, I‚Äôm a horror writer at heart- but I say this because I made my character do research, right? I made him know his stuff is what I‚Äôm saying.

More specifically, I made him know that this elderly jogger ran at an average pace of 6 miles an hour and that his neck would be exactly 5 feet and 4 inches from the ground. 

All that ‚Äúknowing‚Äù I did, yet, as I watched the jogger slam into the wire and get clotheslined to his butt, the blood wasn‚Äôt coming out at nearly the speed I thought it would. 

In fact, the jogger just sat there, rubbing his neck and becoming absolutely flabbergasted as he drew his hand back from his throat revealing watery red blood coating his palm.

In a state of animalistic fear after noticing the wire, his eyes darted around wildly as he rose to his feet. 

Afraid of my target's escape, I quickly jumped from the bush where I hid, waiting to take a picture of him upon the job's completion. 

His eyes lit up with fear as I knocked him back down to his back, quickly analyzing the area to make sure no one was around. 

As the old man struggled to get up, I unhooked the wire from one of the trees and wrapped it around his neck. 

I pulled as hard as I could and heard flesh tearing and veins ripping as the man's struggling grunts turned to gurgles, and the sound of wet flopping filled the air. 

Once his feet stopped kicking and his body went completely limp, I removed the wire from around his neck. He was nearly decapitated as he lay there on the vacant walking trail. The sounds of nature continued, and birds sang to the backdrop of gently trickling water from a nearby stream as the man's blood leaked further and further down the concrete.

As I said, my character had to take photos upon the job's completion, so that‚Äôs what he did.  

I snapped a few shots from various angles before rolling up the wire and hurrying back to my old Volkswagen, completely covered in blood.

Again, I AM NOT A MYSTERY WRITER. 

Like, I didn‚Äôt even put the effort into thinking about all the DNA evidence to be collected from the scene, the amount of witnesses that could‚Äôve been around in such a public space, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the fact that he just, what? Left the old man there on the trail for people to find and alert authorities? Fuck, man, like pick a lane, right? 

See, that‚Äôs exactly what I thought too. 

And that‚Äôs exactly why I DELETED that story. Moved it to the trash bin immediately after reading it, utterly ashamed of myself, I must say. 

I 100 percent planned on just calling it a night, and picking up on a new *horror* story the next day. 

As I lay in bed and drifted into sleep, it felt as though my eyes were closed for mere moments before the booming sound of knocks came thumping from my front door. Sunlight filled my room, and as I groggily made my way towards the door, the rhythmic knocking abruptly stopped. 

I crept up and checked the peephole to find no one there. 

When I opened the door, there wasn‚Äôt even anyone in the hallway; however, there were some Polaroid photos placed carefully on my welcome mat.

They were of the old man, exactly how I had imagined him and exactly how I‚Äôd mutilated him. All taken from the exact angles as the story.

I couldn‚Äôt even move for a brief moment as I stared down at them, disgusted at how they decorated the mat.

I quickly gathered my thoughts, however, and scooped up each of the 6 photos. 

Lying them out on the coffee table, I sat down on the couch with a ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt possibly be happening‚Äù look on my face, and my head fell into my hands as the realization hit me. 

I flipped on the TV and turned to the news just in time to see the headline:

KEY WITNESS IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE FOUND DEAD ON WALKING TRAIL IN ATLANTA

‚ÄúWelp,‚Äù I thought to myself. ‚ÄúIt was fun while it lasted.‚Äù 

Look, I‚Äôm writing this now because I‚Äôm not sure when my next story will be. I can hear the tactical boots of a SWAT team rushing up the stairs in my building, and I‚Äôm sure I know exactly where they‚Äôre headed. I‚Äôm not sure what else to say, other than thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed.

I found the following recipe to be exceptionally good even compared to other v60 filters. 

Generic recepie for light roasts:
-10 grams of ground coffee
- grind size identical as 15 grams recipe using hario regular filters. (45 on df64 gen 2 stock burrs)
-95c water temp
- bloom of 30 ml water
- start pours after 1 minute: Two pours, each of 65-70 ml water (130-140 overall)
-pouring speed should be atmost 2 ml/grams per second
-160-170 ml water overall
- should take around 3:30 minutes

The most important things here are maintaining low agitation.

Notes:
- If your grinder produces lot of fines, increase the grind size. I used 45 setting on df64 gen2 with df stock burrs.
- swirl at most twice. Avoid making much agotation since the filters are sensetive to fines.
- do not mix with a spoon or anything like it!!!

1nicm0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nicm0x/i_took_a_sewing_job_at_a_remote_textile_mill_now/,"I took a sewing job at a remote textile mill, now I'm afraid of needles.","It was the beginning of summer in Ohio, the weather had just stopped flip flopping between warm afternoons and cold rainy mornings. I was driving an old beat-up ford id acquired when I was 18 as a graduation gift. I was enjoying the drive on the back roads of rural Ohio. They were beautiful this time of year, a yellow filter seemed to layer a haze over the various fields of greenery I passed, the song of the cicadas like a quilt of sound reaching out over empty fields. I was heading out to a textile mill a friend had told me about. I‚Äôd been out of a job for about two weeks, the retail job id had previously had gone under, didn't get much but a boot out the door after the last of the product had been liquidated, the warehouse I'd come to known as a second home seemed so empty and silent on my last day there. I was excited though; to try something new, the hustle and bustle of customer service had begun to wear on me the last couple of years.¬† the textile mills name was Bees in the Basket, cloth and loom co., my friend had promised they‚Äôd take in anyone who knew how to use a sewing machine, they‚Äôd teach you how to do anything else on the job. The building was mostly known for repairing old boat covers and mass-producing bean bag chairs. It seemed like a chill place to work.¬†¬†

Upon pulling up into the driveway of the old textile mill, big Betsy's tires swallowing the gravel into the large groove of her tires, I noticed what looked like an old one-horse town out behind the building, it looked forgotten in time compared to the mill. The mill itself had been recently painted a bright yellow, tasteful brown shutters over large bay windows, a field of sunflowers full in bloom off to the left, that must've been owned by some local farmers. The town behind was lost though, a water tower, a small school, and what looked like an old bar, all boarded up so long ago that the wood had aged to grey some falling off the windows. I parked the truck one of her belts whining as she slowed down to park.¬†

As I approached the building I noticed their logo a black graphic of a bee on a yellow board, a dotted line following the bee in a large circle, inside were the letters B&B in an ornate font. Upon entering the place it had the familiar smell of a large warehouse, id entered a large waiting area with normal padded office chairs you'd see anywhere lined up, there were a couple other people there, an elderly couple, a man in a brown suit and a janitor messing with what looked like an elevator. I approached the woman at the desk, who seemed absorbed in whatever she was typing, she noticed me and looked up.¬†

Politely she said, ‚ÄúHello how may I help you?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúI called last Tuesday; I'm here for an interview.‚Äù¬†

She sat up looking excited ‚ÄúOh, nice to meet you I‚Äôm Marice, we haven't gotten someone so young in some time, usually elderly woman, not many young'uns interested in the trades.‚Äù¬†

Marice started going through some papers in her filing cabinet, she pulled out a small pamphlet. ‚ÄúAlright ill need you to fill this out, and there is a drug test, if you head down the road about 10 miles, there's an urgent care there, they‚Äôll take care of everything and send it down to us.‚Äù¬†

Marice handed me the pamphlet ‚Äúyou seem like a good kid I'm sure Barney will be excited to have you on board.‚Äù¬†¬†

I sat down and started filling out the pamphlet, it was standard fair other than a few questions that stuck out to me, have you ever had any fear of needles, have you had any fear of the color yellow,¬† then back to normal questions, are you comfortable lifting over 25 pounds for extended periods of time, are you comfortable working long hours inside etc. Those two questions seemed to stick out to me, odd but not a deal breaker. Why would someone applying at a textile mill be afraid of needles?¬†

About a week later my drug test had come back and id gotten a call to come back in i went to talk to Marice she perked up seeing me.¬†

‚ÄúOh, hello young man, Barney is upstairs and to the left he‚Äôll see you now, don't tell anyone but he seems excited.‚Äù¬†

I headed up the stairs the back of the building didn't have the flair of the front just brick walls painted white a normal office door with a fogged glass window. Barney was sitting behind his desk the only things in the office were a desk a fax machine, a coffee machine, and a sewing machine sitting in the middle of the room.¬†

Barney waved me over and held out his hand for a handshake. I shook his hand; he had a tight and slightly sweaty grip.¬†

Barney released me from the handshake and looked over to the sewing machine ‚Äúsorry about the sewing machine, you don't have any training on it specified in your resume, just wanted to make sure you're comfortable with the machine.‚Äù¬†

I replied ‚Äúsorry most of my know how is from my grandma, I haven't done it in any professional capacity, mostly just fixing dresses for my sisters or fixing up some old stuffed animals. I was told there'd be on site training.‚Äù¬†

Barney waved towards me in an assuring manor ‚ÄúWe all got to start somewhere, just want to see where you stand.‚Äù¬†

Barney pulled out a spool of yellow thread from his desk, he sat it next to a square cloth with a fringe of black around the outer edge. ‚ÄúI need you to use this spool to make a square yellow box about three inches from the center of this cloth.‚Äù¬†

I sat at the machine and did the things the way my grandma had taught me I used the measurement tools on the machine to begin my stitch, and started the machine, it had been some time since the last time id used a sewing machine and I was used to my grandmas machine, but I felt I was doing good, I moved the cloth going with the flow of the machine, before I noticed Id almost finished the first stitch and was feeling good, the second stitch and third went just as smooth. I was focused and I had an audience, so I felt the need to do good work. The final stitch was going smoothly I felt almost like I was in a trance when I noticed a scarlet red color blotting on to the pure white cloth, I finished the final stitch but realized I had gotten myself.¬†

I licked my finger where the needle had gotten me.¬†

Barney chuckled ‚ÄúThats a good job their son, The machine gets us all sometimes, you didn't freak out though. I've seen people pass out from the sight of their own blood.‚Äù¬†

I felt like an idiot, I needed this job and had made myself look foolish, the iron from the blood stung my tongue.¬†

Barney sat at his desk ‚ÄúWell I'll give you call in a couple days if we select you for the position, you did good though don't feel down about that little mishap.‚Äù¬†

I was angry at myself leaving that day, Betsy showed she still had some kick left in her tearing up those back roads that day.¬†

It had been about a week since the interview at Bees in the Basket, I'd had a hard time, I applied at McDonald‚Äôs, rock bottom I would imagine. My friend who had told me about the mill passed away he‚Äôd overdosed, he‚Äôd had a long battle with drugs, and he‚Äôd finally lost. It was hard facing his mother; I had walked that path with him once when we were younger, but our paths had diverged. He had gotten into harder stuff and id backed off I was never going to touch anything that involved a needle. My thought process was that he was a grown man and could make his own decisions. I wish now that I had gotten involved, but that kind of guilt always follows in sad situations like these.¬†

I attended the funeral with my friend's mother, watching a parent bury their child is heart wrenching.¬† They lowered him into the ground, and he‚Äôd never been dressed as nice as he was now a black suit and tie. The whole situation was mildly grandiose he would have hated it; his hair was parted to one side completely different from how I had always known him, with his messy bed head covered by a Carhart beanie. I said goodbye to his mother as I was leaving, she gave me a limp hug, her tears wetting my shoulder.¬†

I woke up late the next day me and couple friends had been out drinking in my friend's honor, stupid and bullish but a traditional way for the midwestern to mourn. Doing burn outs around a bonfire and falling asleep under the stars unpolluted by the inner city's light pollution can be beautiful in the moment but painful in the morning. I woke up around noon and wiped some gravel off my exposed back my shirt being pulled up about halfway. I noticed id had two missed calls one at six thirty, and one at ten both were from Bee‚Äôs in the Basket. I fumbled with my phone the mid-day sun piercing my eyes and called them back. Marice answered the phone.¬†

‚ÄúHello Bee‚Äôs in the Basket, is this a personal project, or business related?‚Äù¬†

I replied groggily ‚ÄúI had an interview a week or so ago, you guys called earlier, but I missed them. I was dealing with a family issue.‚Äù¬†

I heard some loud typing on Marice's end ‚ÄúOh no problem sweetheart, do you have time to come in today sometime before five o‚Äôclock, so we can get you worked in to the schedule, and iron out some details like your banking info and such?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI got the job.‚Äù I replied confused.¬†

Marice seemed chipper ‚ÄúYes of course honey, Barney was very impressed by your interview. Sorry it took so long to get back to you, your drug test took a while to get back must have been lost in the mail.‚Äù¬†

I was excited, I had been worried about the drug test, id smoked some weed with friends two weeks before, let alone how bad I‚Äôd felt the interview went.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there in 45 minutes, thank you both, this means a lot to me.‚Äù I replied feeling a sort of relief fall over me, it was nice to have something work out for me considering the week I'd had.¬†

‚ÄúOk darling well be here and were glad to have you.‚Äù Marice hung up the phone.¬†

I went into my friend's bathroom and gave myself a whore's bath, threw some water on myself wet down my nested hair and borrowed some of his body spray. I hopped in Ol Betsy and spent some rubber flooring it to the mill.¬†

I‚Äôd been working at Bee‚Äôs in the Basket for about six months, summer had left us all behind and the Ohio chaos had begun. It was November and the weather swapped between a baron grey landscape of naked trees and dead fields at seventy degrees and a snow scape with a thin layer of white like a sheet blanketed over the backdrop of the once flourishing farmland. Bee‚Äôs in the Basket stayed the same though no matter the background, a large yellow building with a monotonous fog obscuring the forgotten town behind it.¬†

My time at the mill was uneventful, my coworkers were mostly elderly women who seemed like they‚Äôd been working there for a while. They were all obviously more tenured than me. They mostly kept to themselves; I had no doubt they gossiped amongst themselves, but I wasn‚Äôt making any waves. My days were spent fixing patches in boat covers and I found I enjoyed the sewing more than I thought I would. It felt like a connection to my grandma who had passed slightly after I finished high school. I thought at least this would make her proud. The money was good, and it was a full-time job. I was doing better than I had in some time. I stopped by my friend's grave twice both times felt overwhelming. Just before he passed, he‚Äôd helped set me up and got me out of bad situation. I wondered how he even found out about Bee‚Äôs in the Basket. It was so out of the way, an odd find.¬†

After the second visit to his grave, I spent some time with some of our mutual friends at a bon fire at their house. This mutual friend lived out on some old farmland he‚Äôd never moved out of his parent‚Äôs house. He just helped around the farm, so he didn't have much to do in the colder months.¬† Me and him sat around the fire trying to absorb some of the warmth into our extremities.¬†

‚ÄúYou have any idea how Drew knew about Bee‚Äôs in the Basket?‚Äù I asked looking over and rubbing my hands together.¬†

My friend chuckled ‚ÄúHe was obsessed with that place; he never told you about it?‚Äù¬†

I shook my head ‚ÄúHe always made fun of me for helping my grandma with sewing and stuff like that.‚Äù¬†

I felt a chuckle escape me remembering Drew ‚ÄúCalled me gay all the time.‚Äù¬†

My friend laughed ‚ÄúYep, real homophobic bastard.‚Äù¬†

I replied squinting ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gay.‚Äù¬†

He slapped me on the back ‚ÄúNo no, he wasn't interested in sewing or anything. He loved these like local ghost stories. You ever hear of the stitcher?‚Äù¬†

I was confused Drew had never talked about any like that with me.¬†

‚ÄúNo, I didn't know he was interested in stuff like that.‚Äù¬†

My friend was looking into the fire ‚ÄúYeh he was super into that stuff. In the 1930s There was supposedly a guy there who would fix clothes and stuff in that old town behind that mill and he was good at it. It being the great depression no one could afford his services, so he worked for cheap. He became a local hero of a sort for lowering his prices. Anyways a hard winter hit that town. Back in those days there wasn't anything else around nowhere for the townspeople to go.¬†¬†

I interrupted ‚ÄúAw man this reminds me of history class, you ever think about teaching after they fix your brain.‚Äù¬†

My friend waved his hand at me ‚ÄúShut up and let me tell the story alright. Ok where was I? These people where stuck in a storm, they had no food didn't have clothes for the weather. So, these people were cold and starving like that group of people that got stuck on that mountain.‚Äù¬†

I interrupted again ‚ÄúSo they ate each other scary.‚Äù¬†

He rolled his eyes ‚ÄúDo you want me to finish? you keep interrupting, sure sounds like your scared.‚Äù¬†

I replied, ‚ÄúScared of some bullshit, I'm shaking in my size 12 boots.‚Äù¬†

My friend pawed at his forehead exasperated.¬†

I put my hands up ‚Äúfine, fine finish. I‚Äôll stop.‚Äù¬†

He looked off again ‚ÄúSo there's more to it than them eating each other, so this stitcher guy would take the skin of those they ate, he made sure they saved the skins, made coats and boots and other things out of those they ate. Sounds fake as hell but Drew loved that shit.‚Äù¬†

I laughed ‚ÄúSo Drew sent me to get skinned and turned into a nice fur coat.‚Äù¬†

He chuckled ‚ÄúYour Balding ass would be a Duster or something, no fur involved.‚Äù¬†

I rolled my eyes.¬†

My friend put his hands in his pockets ‚ÄúI think he wanted to get into the basement of that mill; he said those places were connected with underground tunnels. He probably thought you'd be able to get him in there after a while.‚Äù¬†

I spent the next couple of months working normally at Bee‚Äôs in the Basket I was doing well there. I‚Äôd gotten a new truck, and Barney had bought Old Bertha off me she was being used as a work truck moving boat covers around, Barney seemed to take a pride in her he kept her close to the main entrance when she wasn't in use. I‚Äôd been there almost a year, mostly I had forgotten about that story my friend had told me around the fire, just a goofy ghost story. I would occasionally hear that elevator ding while I was working. Barney would storm off cursing.¬†

‚ÄúMarice that damn elevator is going off again ‚Äú¬†

Marice would reply ‚ÄúOh Barney the repairman said there might be a draw somewhere in the building giving it power.‚Äù¬†

Barney would storm off ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get this whole damn building rewired.‚Äù¬†

Barney had put a lot of trust in me and had given me a key to lock the building up if there were any days I felt like working overtime to finish a project or finish cleaning up.¬†

I‚Äôd caught Barney during lunch sometime in May, I asked him about the elevator and why it upset him so much.¬†

Barney clasped his hands together ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a damn safety hazard, there's a basement floor down there, but it's filled with stagnant water. If someone fell in there I‚Äôd be up to my ass in lawsuits.‚Äù¬†

I tapped the table ‚ÄúWhy not just have it walled off?‚Äù¬†

Barney looked at me ‚ÄúThe city, it‚Äôs a code violation of some sort, can't even have it filled with cement. Why so interested?‚Äù¬†

I shrugged ‚ÄúYou guys have helped me out a lot, I‚Äôve got a little bit of electrical experience. I could head down there could be a junction box or something causing the draw.‚Äù¬†

Barney put his arm over my shoulder ‚ÄúNo, there's no need for that, we got professionals who look into that kind of thing. I know I get upset but don't you worry about it.‚Äù¬†

I left that conversation content, it didn't feel like Barney was hiding anything, but it did bring to mind Drew, his final wish on this earth was to get into that basement and I had everything I needed to sneak in there.¬†

I waited a couple weeks till we had a large project a local lake had needed multiple boat covers to be finished within a week. The old ladies were throwing a fit but working hard none the less. It gave me the perfect chance to investigate that elevator. I‚Äôd finished two boat covers during the day and was working on a third. I told Barney I was going to stay late he thanked me told me to lock up on the way out.¬†

You could see the dark country night through the large windows that normally lit the sewing room floor. The darkness was an ichor like the whole building had been swallowed by the sea. The only light coming from the flickering tube lights hanging from the ceiling. I finished the boat cover and cleaned up. I made my way to the elevator. It was stuck shut and looked to be stuck between two different floors. I stuck my fingertips into the edges and tried to pry it open, but it wasn't budging. I leaned back and sat on the floor trying to come up with a plan of action. I‚Äôd sat there maybe 15 minutes or so when the elevator dinged. The yellow light above the elevator flickered and the elevator came to life. The elevator box moved erratically opening and closing leaving a small gap. I went and grabbed one of the metal push brooms meant to clean the sewing room floor. I pushed the broom stick into the small gap and managed to pry the door open just enough to push myself in.¬†

The Elevator was very spartan on the inside, mostly just caged metal a small grate on the bottom a yellow caution light flashing underneath. I pulled out a pin and opened the grate it creaked and whined like it hadn't been opened in a long time. I pulled myself through and fell knee first maybe four feet, in the darkness I had a hard time judging the distance, it was going to difficult to pull myself back up into the elevator. My knees were wet but there wasn't much more than a puddle at the bottom, a small channel of [water.as](http://water.as) I looked up at the end of what looked like a long utility hallway a caution light moving in a circular pattern. At the end of the hallway, I swore I saw Drew.¬†¬†

I called out ‚ÄúHey you stuck down here, need any help?‚Äù¬†

The person didn't respond. I stood up and as I did the person at the end of the hall opened a metal door and ran off. The door slammed shut, the screeching of the door was like nails on a chalkboard, the sound bouncing off the confined metal walkway was deafening. I walked down the hallway, it was the only path to take, I didn't realize from looking but the hallway was at a slight decline and was a lot longer than I had originally thought. The sound of my footsteps echoed it almost sounded like someone else was walking behind me matching my stride, I looked over my shoulder every couple steps, for an old utility hallway this place felt ominous. I figured the person I saw was my mind playing tricks on me, the place smelled strongly of iron, I figured there must be a significant amount of rust somewhere lower down. The door must have been set to a timer a slight draw on the power grid wouldn't be fully powering this area, Barney must have hired a craigslist handyman or something. I reached the end of the path and realized along with the declination of the path, the ceiling was also lower my head was touching the ceiling. I had to crouch to reach the door. The door itself was odd; there was a cylindrical hole with a T shaped handle on the other side, the older kind like you would use to open a sluice gate. I looked around and waited with hope that¬†the door would open based on a timer. After about fifteen minutes I figured it might be set to an eight-hour timer like some of the old mines and I didn't have time.¬†

I felt along the inside of the cylinder, it didn't feel rusted at all, strange. There were some small holes along the inside of the cylinder I didn't understand what use there would be for them to be there. I slowly fished my arm through the cylinder, I was in an awkward position, crouched over my arm completely stretched out, I could barely reach the handle my fingertips brushing it. I had to take a knee and push my arm to reach the handle. I quickly turned the handle towards the twelve o‚Äôclock position.¬†

I heard a large thunk sound and the door opened as it did twelve needles shot out of the cylinder piercing my arm, my white shirt sleeve became speckled with multiple spots creating a webbed network of red.¬†

‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù¬†

The needles had stopped as soon as they drew blood, barely entering the skin, but it was still excruciating being pierced by so many foreign objects.¬†

‚ÄúFuck fuck fuck.‚Äù¬†

The needles remained where they were, my animal brain ignored the ridiculousness of the situation and was more focused on the fact that if the needles didn't retract, I was going to have to pull my arm and hand through the needles.¬†

The yellow caution lights in the hallway had turned red. I was starting to freak out. I'd been rabbit hunting before seen the leg of a white rabbit bone and sinew pure white invaded by red. The rabbit hadn‚Äôt gotten far dead behind the tree, but being trapped had given it the will to remove its own limb to survive. That old idiom, an animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to survive.¬†

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù I breathed mumbling.¬†

I started taking deep breathes to calm myself, figure a way out that didn't involve mutilating myself. I reached back towards the handle firmly grasped it and returned it to its original horizontal position. A large thunk and the door slammed shut screeching as it returned to its original state. The needles retracted. I had sunk to the floor panting my arm resting in the cylinder. The caution lights dulled returning to a yellow swirl.¬†

I removed my arm from the cylinder nursing it. Then made my way back to the elevator. I felt a strong need to get the hell out of the place. I jumped towards the grates on the bottom of the elevator smacking my ribs on the grates, the pain shot through me, but I pulled myself up. Light pierced the gap in the elevator doors blinding me. I pulled myself out of the elevator the sun was rising, I‚Äôd entered the elevator around midnight there was no way I‚Äôd been down there six hours.¬†

I shut the elevator behind me pushing it shut with the broom, locked the building then limped to my truck. My arm was leaking, and I‚Äôd remembered there was that urgent care down the street. It took me 15 minutes to get there riding the pedal, trying not to get blood everywhere.¬†¬†

The urgent care was empty; I made my way up to the desk my head was pounding. The receptionist was absorbed in a book.¬†

‚ÄúHey mam, I scratched myself up a little bit working on my truck, I think I might need a tetanus shot.‚Äù I said trying to get her nose out of her book.¬†

She looked up ‚ÄúOh. Yes, fill this out for me, I‚Äôll let the doctor know your here‚Äù¬†

The receptionist scurried off and I filled out the form.¬†

The receptionist returned about 5 minutes later ‚ÄúHere let me take you to the doctor, sir.‚Äù¬†

I didn't have to wait long for the doctor, he came in asked me about the wound, I told him I was trying to get the manifold off an old truck at home and got my arm stuck. He poured some peroxide over my arm and wrapped it with gauze.¬†

The doctor spun towards me in his chair ‚ÄúThe wounds are mostly superficial; you got pretty lucky. I‚Äôd say. I‚Äôll still give you the tetanus shot just to be safe. You afraid of needles at all.‚Äù¬†

I rubbed my temple. ‚ÄúNo not particularly doc.‚Äù¬†

The doctor walked across the room grabbing a packaged needle out of the cabinet. ‚ÄúHow did that job interview go by the way?‚Äù¬†

I was confused. ‚ÄúPretty good, I‚Äôve been working there about a year. Why do you ask?‚Äù¬†

The doctor chuckled grabbing a small bottle. ‚ÄúWell, I know I‚Äôm not supposed to look, but there was a little Willie in that pee. Come to think of it, they never even sent me the ups packaging to ship it.‚Äù¬†

The audacity of this doctor was blowing my mind.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said confused by the whole situation.¬†

The doctor sat in his chair and pulled up next to me. ‚ÄúDon't pay it no mind, seems like they may have been impressed by you, don't look a gift horse in the mouth, or so they say.‚Äù¬†

The doctor flicked the needle. ‚ÄúAlright you're going to feel a little pinch.‚Äù¬†

The drive home was strange, the whole situation had me on edge. My arm ached and I was starting to digest everything that had happened. I felt eyes on me. Backroad drives usually calmed me down but at the moment nature itself seemed to be dancing, mocking me as it swam by. I should never have gotten into that elevator.¬†

I called in to tell Barney I wouldn't be in that day, I told him I‚Äôd hurt myself working on a friend's car after I left work. He was upset but told me to get better and not to push myself too much. I fumbled my keys into my front door lock, shut and locked the door behind me, stumbled to my bedroom and fell in my bed. The exhaustion hit me all at once my bed consumed me. I was laying on the quilt that I'd always had as the top layer of my blanket tapestry. My grandma had made the quilt for me when I was 6, it was larger than a king size blanket, she told me I'd grow into it big and strong. It was a white quilt, with deer head motifs stitched into it, green flowers bordered the edges. My eyes flickered as I breathed in the smells and safety of home, then I noticed something that had never been there before. A small yellow stitch was woven into a large square making a border around the quilt.¬†",1,1758014382.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

He was the first man I really fell in love with, some fallout happened between me and my friends, one thing led to another and I got really sick so that left me stranded at his place for a month and then I just never left. Why? I was quite literally too sick to move for a month and then afterwards he kinda expected me not to go to my apartment and I don't know how to say no. Tbh I mostly stayed because a) we'd be spending a lot of time together anyway and b) I didn't want him to think I was only using him when I was sick.

In the meantime I made up with my friends only to realize how much I preferred my life before. I love him, he loves me, but I am bored. Our routine became monotonous. We don't really don't do anything or go anywhere other than watching TV, drinking coffee and taking walks in the same places. Plus, he lives in a small town very near the city my apartment is at and it's too small for me. That's where we are fundamentally different, he doesn't like people and even this is too big for him. He hates the city so I never even suggest us going there.

I feel like I have no space to be goofy or energetic the way I am, not that anyone is stopping me, I'm just not really feeling it. We went through a period of stressful situations and I did NOT like the way he dealt with them - he was grumpy, nagging about life for 3 months straight and every little thing would keep him immersed in his cloud of negative thoughts for DAYS on end (btw just normal life things nothing too dramatic not too big of a deal, nothing unusual). I was doing my best to make him feel better and to be patient but eventually it got to me too. I don't deal with stress like that - I am the opposite. If it cannot be fixed in the moment I'm not gonna feed into the negativity of it.

Then when I finally snapped from feeling miserable because of it it took him longer than expected to realize my point - that I was sharing how I feel too and that my feelings also need validation and that it has nothing to do with his oil pan being broken (that got fixed the next day and he knew that) and that it's not the end of the world. We argued a few times after that over some other things that triggered me, and I started noticing more things too that I did not like.

For example, he left McDonald's because the ordering screen was broken and messed up and we couldn't order what we wanted. So got out, loudly nagging, not waiting for me PLUS letting a gate close on me when I ran after him. His reasoning was he told me he wanted to get out and didn't wanna be there if he couldn't order what he wanted. We argued for a couple hours because he kept repeating how annoying it was not to be able to order properly and would not hear me when I said multiple times I felt disrespected. Then he invalidated it by saying he felt hurt (he moved from a very good country here, very bad country where nothing works).

Anyway that and two other situations are the only arguments we ever had. But it's not even about that, I love him but I don't always want to be feeling down and negative and I don't only wanna sit around all say talking how I wanna go and do things without getting up and doing it. I don't always want to be watching movies in the dark like a bat or listen to ""she's a whore. she's also a whore. he's on drugs"" every time I leave the house or put music on or ANYTHING. Like I get it, most of them really are but I couldn't care less!

I hate to admit it to myself but I feel like this relationship is draining me out. I feel like I'm losing my spark and I gained weight. I feel like I am losing who I am, like a part of me is missing. What I can't accept is why if you love someone and if it's the wrong person why do you start loving the wrong person? How do you know if you should walk away and how do you even walk away?

Feeling Overwhelmed by Spanish Vocabulary? Learn Smarter, Not Harder.

Are you tired of memorizing endless vocabulary lists, only to find you‚Äôre learning words you‚Äôll rarely use or could have easily guessed? Do you feel stuck, unable to move past basic greetings into real, everyday conversations?

Traditional Spanish vocabulary books are often bloated and inefficient. They waste your precious time with obvious cognates (importante, animal, naci√≥n) and complex grammar words better learned through practice. It‚Äôs a slow, frustrating path to fluency.

There is a better way.

Mastering Basic Spanish Vocabulary isn't just another dictionary. It's a strategic and highly efficient learning tool designed specifically for English speakers. We‚Äôve done the hard work for you by meticulously curating a list of the 1000 most frequent and essential Spanish words, then filtering it to create a powerhouse vocabulary builder that respects your time and intelligence.

Inside this book, you will discover:

A Core Vocabulary of 1000 Words: Build a rock-solid foundation with the words you absolutely need to understand and speak Spanish in everyday situations, from ordering coffee to sharing stories.

Maximum Learning Efficiency: We've removed the fluff! This list excludes obvious English cognates and basic grammar words, ensuring that every word you study is a word you genuinely need to learn. Stop wasting time on what you already know and focus on what will truly expand your skills.

Learn in Context, Remember with Ease: Vocabulary is useless without context. That‚Äôs why every single word is paired with a short, simple, and practical Spanish example sentence. You‚Äôll see exactly how words are used, making them easier to remember and apply in real life.

Crystal-Clear Translations: No guesswork needed. Every Spanish word and its corresponding example sentence is followed by a direct and clear English translation, making this book perfect for self-study.

Reinforce as You Go: The example sentences are intentionally designed to use other words from the list, creating a powerful cycle of reinforcement that helps vocabulary stick in your long-term memory.

This book is perfect for:

Absolute beginners looking for the most effective starting point.

Intermediate learners who feel stuck and want to rapidly expand their active vocabulary.

Travelers who need practical language skills for their next trip.

1nic6au,https://www.reddit.com/r/demonhatstories/comments/1nic6au/chapter_5_you_are_one/,Chapter 5: You Are One,"The hospital doors hissed open and Elisabeth stepped outside.

For a moment, she closed her eyes and let the air fill her lungs. Not the sterile, recycled oxygen of corridors and waiting rooms, but air with texture, damp with exhaust, hot with sun, salted faintly from the sea.

Then came the noise.

Horns, engines, brakes shrieking, the world's impatient orchestra slamming back into her body.

She pushed her hands into her coat pockets. The yellow fabric felt comforting. But something was wrong. A sharp edge. Something that didn't belong.

Her fingers found it: a small, folded paper packet.

She pulled it free, unfolding carefully. Inside: a black USB stick. On its back, written in block letters, almost like a child's scrawl:

**THE SUBSTANCE.**

A smaller scrap of paper fluttered out with it. Crumpled, barely legible.

*It changed my life.*

She stared at it while traffic howled around her, as if the chaos of the city had momentarily hushed into a private silence.

Then‚Äî

""Lizzie?? Lizzie Sparkle??""

Her head jerked up.

A man was squinting at her from the sidewalk. Fifties, balding except for a thin ring of hair, cheap glasses sliding down his nose. His grin was too wide, too eager.

""OMG, I can't believe it!"" he said, hurrying toward her.

Elisabeth blinked. Nothing. A blank file in her memory.

""Fred! From 10th grade homeroom!""

Recognition didn't come, not really but she forced her face into a polite mask.

""Oh‚Ä¶ Fred. Of course.""

He laughed and ran a hand over his bare scalp. ""Yeah, baldness runs in the family. No escaping it.""

""Oh no, that's not what I‚Äî""

""You, however,"" he barreled on, ""haven't changed! Still the most beautiful girl in the world. I've followed your career. What a success! Wow, wow, *wow!*""

She smiled faintly, her hand closing around the USB stick in her pocket. He didn't notice.

""And the funny thing is,"" Fred continued, leaning a little too close, ""my mom used to buy your toothpaste. So every Christmas when I went home, brushing my teeth, I'd think about you.""

Elisabeth froze. Her smile didn't move.

""Oh‚Ä¶ that's‚Äî""

""She's dead now.""

The words dropped between them. A beat too long.

""‚Ä¶creepy,"" Elisabeth thought, though she only nodded.

A taxi screeched to a stop at the curb then Fred brightened.

""Oh, that's for me! Hey, why don't we go for a drink sometime now that we've reconnected?""

She opened her mouth, but he cut himself off: ""Oh, I'm stupid. Of course you're super busy‚Ä¶""

""Why don't you give me your card?"" she offered, polite reflex.

""I'm not a *card* guy, but‚Ä¶"" He plunged a hand into his pocket, producing a crumpled sheaf of papers. Not business cards, medical test results.

He fumbled with them, searching for blank space to write on, while Elisabeth's fingers curled tighter around the USB, as if it might vanish.

Fred dug into the pile of test results, flipping through them with clumsy fingers until he found a blank corner.

""What do we have here‚Ä¶ okay, this'll do.""

He scribbled a number in hurried strokes, then glanced up at her sheepishly. ""Please don't look at my cholesterol levels. They're a disaster.""

Before she could reply, he ripped off the corner of the page with his number scrawled across it. The flimsy scrap caught in a gust of wind, fluttered like a wounded bird, and landed face-down in a puddle of murky water.

""Oh God‚Ä¶""

Fred bent down, groaning as he fished it out. The soggy paper clung to his fingers. He wiped it against his shirt with an awkward laugh.

""Programmer's hands,"" he muttered. ""Not much good away from the keyboard!""

The taxi behind him blared its horn.

Flustered, he shoved the damp fragment into Elisabeth's palm. His touch was clammy. ""Now you've got it!""

He chuckled at his own pun, delighted, then leapt into the backseat of the cab. Through the window, he mimed the telephone gesture, thumb to ear, pinkie to mouth.

*Call me.*

And then he was gone, swallowed by traffic, leaving Elisabeth alone on the hospital steps, a wet scrap of paper in one hand, a USB in the other, the cacophony of the city roaring back around her.

\---

The late-afternoon light bled gold across the city, pouring through the oversized picture window. Elisabeth stood there for a long moment, her silhouette etched against the glass, as if she were nothing but an outline waiting to be filled.

Behind her, the apartment looked immaculate, curated. A life arranged for appearances: the sleek lines of the furniture, the tasteful art, the framed poster of herself that loomed like a monument. In it, she smiled with predatory brightness, hips cocked, wrapped in a blue leotard that now felt like someone else's skin.

On the coffee table sat a bouquet of flowers, still in its crinkling plastic. A small card dangled from it:

*Thank you for all these years with us. You were amazing!*

Her eyes snagged on one word. *Were.* It landed like a slap, harder than any car crash.

She tore her gaze away, slid the USB into the side of her television, and sank into the couch.

The screen went black. Utterly black‚Äîso black it seemed to draw the room into itself.

A man's voice emerged. Deep. Slow and Measured. Beneath it, a faint static crackle, like the sound of a radio tuned just off frequency.

""Have you ever dreamt of a better version of yourself?""

Elisabeth blinked. The question lingered in the air, as if addressed only to her.

The screen remained empty. Nothing to distract from the words.

""We are merely the expression of a genetic code frozen at a precise moment. But your DNA conceals billions of other possibilities. Inside you, there is another you. Or should I say‚Ä¶ billions of other *you's*.""

Her throat tightened. She glanced up at the poster on the wall, the immortal Elisabeth Sparkle. The words wormed their way under her skin.

""One single injection unlocks your DNA, starting a new cellular division that will release another version of yourself. Younger. More beautiful. More perfect.""

A tremor moved through her. Younger. More beautiful. The words struck like both temptation and threat.

And then it came:

The words blazed across the void of the screen in stark white letters, timed to the voice that resonated with finality‚Äî

**THE SUBSTANCE.**

Elisabeth sat frozen on the couch. The screen reflected faintly in her eyes, twin black mirrors filled with promise, with menace, with something she wasn't sure she wanted but could no longer ignore.

The title hung on the screen like a wound. **THE SUBSTANCE.**

Then, silence.

Elisabeth sat there, her breath shallow while waiting. The letters dissolved into blackness. The screen became a mirror again, showing only her reflection. For a long, empty beat, she wondered if it was over.

And then, an image.

A yellow lump of putty appeared on a white surface, filmed from directly above. It looked crude, dented and ordinary. Not gold, not glowing, just a cheap piece of blu tack under harsh laboratory light.

A man's voice returned, steady, almost reverent: *You are the matrix.*

Two hands entered the frame. Male hands. They grasped the putty and began pulling. Slowly. Painfully. Stretching it out until a fragment tore free.

*Everything comes from you.*

The detached piece was rolled between the palms into a second, smaller sphere. Smooth. Perfect. Its symmetry made the first lump seem grotesque, disfigured by comparison.

*And everything is you.*

The hands cradled the two balls, one in each palm, as if presenting twin offerings.

*This is simply‚Ä¶ a better version of yourself.*

Elisabeth swallowed hard. She could almost feel her own body being pinched, pulled and reshaped.

*You just have to share.*

The left hand closed. The left ball vanished. The right remained.

*One week for one.*

Then the left hand opened again as the right closed.

*And one week for the other.*

The camera lingered. Two balls, side by side. Identical, yet not. Perfectly balanced.

*A perfect balance of seven days each.*

A pause. The silence deepened, heavy with unspoken consequence.

*The one and only thing not to forget‚Ä¶*

Words blazed across the screen:

**YOU ARE ONE.**

The camera returned to the two balls. The voice dropped lower, almost a whisper:

**YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FROM YOURSELF.**

And then, with brutal suddenness, the hands smashed the two spheres together. A wet smack. The screen went black.

Elisabeth remained motionless on the couch. The silence of her apartment pressed in on her. She stared at the blank screen until her eyes burned, then rose. Without hesitation, she pulled the USB from the slot, carried it into the kitchen, and dropped it into the trash.

It landed with a dull clatter against porcelain plates and crumpled paper.

For a moment she stood over it, waiting for something.

Nothing came. Only the faint hum of the refrigerator.

And then, faintly, as if underwater, came a muffled noise. Distorted. Indistinct. Something that might have been a memory‚Ä¶ or a warning.

I will share more about the story in time. For now, here is the first draft of Chapter 1 \[PS - there will be a prologue scene prior to this\].

**Chapter 1**

‚ÄúYou know what I like about you, Priya?‚Äù

I looked up at my boss, Ankan Banerjee, just as I was about to take a big bite out of my chicken roll. The afternoon sun streamed through the glass windows into the office, catching the faint streaks of grey at his temples. At thirty-six, Ankan carried himself with a thoughtful dignity that made him appear both approachable and authoritative. That image that people have of the typical gentleman ‚Äì Ankan is that man. His eyes, behind thin-framed spectacles, were a warm dark brown, always crinkling at the corners when he was about to make a point, as if he were sharing a secret with you alone. His features were calm and composed, with a gentle demeanour capable of introducing a sense of tranquillity to any room.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really hungry.‚Äù

I slowly put down my chicken roll on the table in front of me. There was a small grease stain that I hoped Ankan hadn‚Äôt noticed.

‚ÄúNo, no, not like that,‚Äù he almost jumped to clear any inadvertent misunderstanding. He had almost finished his double chicken roll already ‚Äì to be fair, he could eat way more than I ever could. ‚ÄúI mean, you are hungry to chase down important stories. The Salt Lake Mayor‚Äôs Club expos√© is a testament to your abilities and, more importantly, your tenacity.‚Äù

I relaxed and smiled at him while picking up my roll again. I felt a warmth of pride spread through my chest. ‚ÄúThank you, Ankan Da.‚Äù

We both shared a sense of pride and satisfaction over that expos√©. It was easily my biggest piece till date, and honestly, it had terrified me. For three weeks, I'd followed paper trails through municipal offices that reeked of stale cigarettes and corruption, interviewed entitled babus with strong political backing, and combed through financial records to eventually uncover a major corruption and extortion racket being run by a local party leader. The piece had been run on Tuesday. It was now Thursday, and the aftershocks were being felt across the city.

‚ÄúEven though it‚Äôs a big story,‚Äù I said, while digging back into my chicken roll. ‚ÄúMost people will never know exactly how big a deal it is.‚Äù

It was true. There had been plans to expand the racket across the state within a few months. Eventually, it could‚Äôve spread across the country. Multiple political parties had their dirty fingers in that pie. We‚Äôd uncovered evidence of connections that went to the very top of the hierarchy. Fortunately or unfortunately, we did not have enough proof to publish that. But the expos√© had, as far as we knew, put a halt to the entire operation.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Ankan smiled. ‚ÄúI know. You know. Maybe one day, we‚Äôll have the opportunity to tell others as well.‚Äù

I scoffed, my mouth half full. ‚ÄúI doubt it. It‚Äôs probably best if most people never know what a circus our nation is and what clowns those running it are.‚Äù

Fine, I was a bit disillusioned with everything at the moment. It wasn‚Äôt like I did not know the state of corruption in our country. I wasn‚Äôt living under a rock. But seeing it at such close quarters for the first time, feeling the weight of implied threats whispered through anonymous phone calls, watching powerful men casually discuss destroying lives over lunch‚Ä¶ it had left an impact.

In truth, I was fortunate to be working with Ankan and The Feed. Most of my college friends had either given up on journalism altogether or were grinding out SEO-optimized clickbait for media houses that had sold their souls long ago.

Ankan had started The Feed as a simple blog site back in 2020, bang in the middle of the pandemic. He was the only writer back then, publishing investigative pieces from his one-bedroom flat in Jadavpur while the world fell apart around us.

It still astounds me how he managed to grow The Feed into a website with tens of thousands of daily readers. Journalism is dead or, at the very least, dying in India. All major media outlets have essentially become mouthpieces of the political establishment. Some bent willingly to the political will for simple monetary benefits. Some were bought over by businessmen or industrialists who are in bed with the ruling establishment. Others were forced to bend following more heavy-handed coercion.

Journalism is a dying art globally as well ‚Äì thank you, Google! Quality journalism is not profitable anymore. It‚Äôs all about the SEO now, following the whims of Google‚Äôs stupid algorithm. Media houses have to play Google‚Äôs game, ensuring at every step that they never run afoul of their holy algorithm.

Before joining The Feed, I had interviewed with another media outlet that cheerfully informed me I would have to pump out 60 articles every month. If you‚Äôre thinking they had a few screws loose, you are not alone. I had had that thought too, and told them as much. The response was I do not need to produce high-quality articles because it was an SEO growth project, and what was most important was producing a high volume of articles with the right keywords, which I would have been promptly provided by their overpaid SEO team. And the infuriating thing is, this approach has become the norm across the media industry, because it‚Äôs what makes money and polishes up the quarterly balance sheet.

It was precisely in this environment that Ankan started The Feed. From the beginning, he never shied away from inflammatory or controversial topics. If he felt something merited attention, he dove in headfirst. He faced a lot of pushback, a few subtle threats from powerful people, an avalanche of not-so-subtle threats ‚Äì including straight up death threats ‚Äì from a constant army of Government-backed social media trolls, organized smear campaigns designed to discredit him, and a lot more. Somehow, he fought through it all, The Feed kept growing and eventually, he was able to hire others to join his mission.

I‚Äôd been fortunate enough to join The Feed in September 2023. Technically, I was still on probation and did not have a permanent contract yet.

There were 13 of us presently, including Ankan. We were working in a hybrid model. Work from home was actively encouraged. To be honest, the three-room office in a converted garage in Ballygunge got pretty cramped if everyone showed up on the same day, which thankfully rarely happened.

Things changed in April 2024 when The Feed received funding worth 6 crore rupees. I still remember the day Ankan had gathered us all in the cramped office, grinning like a kid who'd just been handed the keys to a chocolate factory. For the first time, he had funds to spare. We would move to a bigger office space next year. More personnel would be hired, too. Most importantly, Ankan could pursue stories without financial barriers and protect his staff better. That protection was incredibly valuable given that we didn‚Äôt shy away from any story.

Earlier in the month, Hassan ‚Äì amazing guy, tremendous journalist, and most importantly, the best biryani chef I‚Äôve met ‚Äì had written an extended piece on the recent electoral bonds scam. The day the piece was published, a popular Twitter account sympathetic to the Central Government and followed by members of the ruling party, posted a picture of Hassan accompanied by his full name, address and email, followed by the caption, ‚ÄúSo these antinationals are the people who write such articles for The Feed‚Äù. The implication was clear. They were attacking Hassan‚Äôs religion, his identity as a Muslim. The reply section was inundated with death threats from troll accounts: ‚ÄúWe know where you live now‚Äù, ‚ÄúBe careful on your next morning walk‚Äù ‚Äì for context, several journalists who have not sufficiently towed the Government narrative have been killed on morning walks in recent years.

We were used to this by now. It was intimidation, meant to shut down any straying voices. It was still unnerving every time it happened, but at The Feed, we had kind of accepted that we would need to deal with such things on a regular basis. But this time turned out different. This time, the noise stopped within a couple of days. Ankan‚Äôs policy usually was that if an article elicited personal threats, the person on the receiving end would lay off overly controversial topics for a couple of weeks. Hassan, because of his religion, was considered particularly vulnerable and had been temporarily taken off sensitive assignments before. But this time, Ankan had just smiled and told him, ‚ÄúKeep up the good work, you‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù

And he had been. We realised the investor money was a game-changer. We were playing in a higher league now, with resources to match Ankan‚Äôs ‚Äì and our ‚Äì ambitions.

‚ÄúYeah, a story like that can be overwhelming,‚Äù Ankan laughed, finishing his roll and wiping his hands on a paper napkin. ‚ÄúI have an easier lead for you now.‚Äù

I frowned. Ankan had decided that I should focus on some smaller and easier stories for a while. I recognised he was looking out for me and I appreciated that. But I still wasn‚Äôt thrilled about it.

""You know I appreciate the concern, but I didn't get into journalism to write easy puff pieces,"" I said, unable to keep the frustration out of my voice.

Ankan chuckled. ""Trust me, this is valuable work and I need someone I can trust to do a job with it.‚Äù

Ankan had a little pet project ‚Äì one of a gazillion, honestly ‚Äì where he wanted to bring to light a lot of the social work going on throughout Bengal. He not only wanted to bring the spotlight on these activities, but also hoped that it would firstly, encourage more people to get involved with social work, and secondly, drum up interest to get more funding for the social organisations.

He leaned forward, and I could see the sincerity in his eyes. ""Look, Priya, corruption stories are important, but so are the people fighting the honest fight at the grassroots level. Sometimes, it‚Äôs more valuable to shine a light on what's actually working than to expose the darkness.""

I sighed. He had a point. Or maybe he was just good with words. Probably both. ""Okay, what‚Äôs your lead?""

Ankan reached into his backpack and fished out the battered Classmate notebook he took everywhere. I had spent decades of my life across school and college filling these Classmate notebooks. Now, the mere sight of them just gave me PTSD.

The edges of the notebook were curled, corners dog-eared, the cover dotted with the occasional coffee stain. He turned a couple of pages with his forefinger and drew out a crumpled sheet that he slid across the table towards me.

I scanned through column after column of names, hand-inked, some underlined, almost all unfamiliar. ‚ÄúSrimani Youth Initiative‚Äù, ‚ÄúEast Bengal Care Society‚Äù, ‚ÄúPadma Ladies‚Äô Trust‚Äù. My eyes snagged on a neat, English phrase wedged near the bottom right, circled and written in slightly larger letters. It was clearly meant to catch the eye. ‚ÄúBright Futures International School.‚Äù

‚ÄúEuropean NGO,‚Äù Ankan said, noticing where my gaze had settled. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got solid funding these days. The school is in Salt Lake, Sector III. Their students are mostly orphans and underprivileged kids. I would recommend you start there, the principal‚Äôs supposed to be very hands-on.‚Äù

A rooster call interrupted the conversation. Ankan smiled, he was familiar with my WhatsApp message tone by now. I glanced briefly at my phone. ‚ÄúMa‚Äù, I announced, bracing myself. I had a feeling I knew what was coming as I opened my WhatsApp.

Right on cue, there was a photo of a grinning, nerdy-looking guy about my age in a plaid shirt, arms awkwardly at his sides, posing next to a car. The caption underneath was, ‚ÄúLooks settled and good job in IT! I showed him your photo.‚Äù

My parents had gone into overdrive, my mom even more so. I was twenty-eight already, and they had to get me hitched with a nice man before I turned into an old unmarriageable hag in two years‚Äô time.

I let my phone drop back onto the table, screen down. ‚ÄúI swear, Ankan Da, I don‚Äôt know what to do with these photos. She tells me nothing except ‚Äògood job‚Äô every single time.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it is, and you know it,‚Äù he said, grinning. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her get to you. And don‚Äôt worry about the ‚Äòget married before thirty‚Äô deadline, lots of people are getting married after thirty nowadays.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. But,‚Äù I lifted my arms for dramatic effect. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told her this. Telling me a guy has a job or a degree tells me nothing about the guy. She keeps sending me nouns, I need at least some adjectives for crying out loud.‚Äù

\*\*\*

A couple of hours later, I was hunched over my Lenovo ThinkPad in the stuffier-than-usual chaos of the Ballygunge office. While outside, a typical humid Kolkata afternoon crawled past to the tune of persistent honking, inside our garage-turned-newsroom, I found the energy oddly soothing ‚Äì the clack of Chandan‚Äôs frantic typing in one corner, the sweet-salty whiff of milky tea brewing somewhere or the other, the faint echo of a biscuit packet rustling open. I felt comfortable here, in my element as they say.

I typed ‚ÄúBright Futures International School‚Äù into Google, expecting some grainy photos or dry PDFs. Instead, I was directed to a slick website with a modern design ‚Äì soft blues, international logos, pictures of children smiling beneath polka-dot banners. Their mission statement read like it had been run through five PR rinses. ‚ÄúEmpowering global youth through holistic, student-led approaches in a digital-first world‚Äù. As a journalist, I recognised it for what it was ‚Äì fashionable words with zero substance.

Sudip, our hairy, sardonic features editor, ambled by clutching the battered office kettle. He peered over my shoulder, grinning. ‚ÄúAh, look! Our star reporter is slumming it with the softies. So what‚Äôs next on your agenda ‚Äì annual day at a Montessori?‚Äù

I gave him my most withering stare. ‚ÄúAt least they‚Äôll give me a juice and Winkies for my troubles.‚Äù I turned back to the screen. It was all extremely neat ‚Äì glossy videos, staged testimonials, even some drone footage. But there was zero specificity on what they actually did.

After nearly fifteen minutes, I finally found a half-hidden mention in some local e-paper. Six months ago, Bright Futures had received a ‚Äúsignificant international donation to initiate a special arts program for underprivileged children.‚Äù The article was just a fluff paragraph accompanied by a photo of serious-looking men shaking hands.

In my experience, the more real money was involved, the less anyone wanted to say.

I jotted the phrase ""special arts program"" at the top of my notepad, next to a fresh grease stain from the earlier chicken roll. I really had to work on my roll eating technique as we seemed to do that a lot here. Just one of those occupational hazards of working at The Feed!",3,1758012186.0,story,0,1.0,False

More often than not it isn't clear what even defines as ""complete"".

Made up example: A new point of sales software is due and you have tons of requirements. One is of course that VAT needs to be calculated into the net price.
Welcome to my country: The VAT system is ridiculously complex. The government wants to guide society behavior by  adding different VAT values for ""good"" or ""bad"" things. To put the correct VAT on a christmas tree you need to do about 7 checks first, the VAT on a cup of coffee can change with the amount of fat in the milk in it or if you drink it at a table or take it with you 

So if I would test that software, I would  have some tests prepared on this, even if it's likely that the whole VAT system is not written explicitly in all detail in the reqs of the new UI. To be fair, this sometimes causes issues in projects as nobody expects the QA to mark software as incomplete or non shippable even if it fullfills (technically) the given reqs.

But especially in agile environment I sometimes doubt if I don't cause to much trouble and ""shortcuts"". The reaction of DEV and PO is often to just hack shit into the code fast for the missing parts. Still not updating the req. So the overall quality of the project sometimes feels deteriorating.
Maybe I shouldn't just let it go and then have a new iteration of that item.


So:

Do you do stuff like this? Do you feel responsible for implicitly QAing the requirements as well?


Or do focus on your work, so test exactly what is in the requirements, trusting that they will be complete or that other quality gates / processes will cover that?",0,1758012138.0,softwaretesting,2,0.5,False

1nibys7,https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfreeuk/comments/1nibys7/whats_with_restaurants_asking_me_if_my_gf_choice/,What's with restaurants asking me if my GF choice is an allergy,"I'd understand it if what they meant was ""are you going to get ill from traces of gluten, or is some cross contamination okay?"" but the way they phrase it makes me question whether it's safe to eat there.

I had this conversation at a pub recently when I asked for the GF version of a dish, and I was asked if it's an allergy, I said "" kind of, it's an intolerance"". He told me they have to record if it's an allergy or just a preference, and I paused again, and told him "" it's not just a preference"". Since when is eating GF just a preference, do they think it's the same as asking for almond milk in your coffee?

At a different venue before, I tried to respond to the same allergy question, with stating whether I'm celiac or non-celiac, I got blank stares like it's the first time they hear those words. 

Am I expecting too much thinking people in the food industry should know the difference? Otherwise what's the point of the question about allergies? If I said no, are they going to ignore health and safety? Shouldn't they be cooking my food as I asked regardless?

But then if I call it an allergy and they do it wrong, I won't be swelling up or foaming in the mouth the second I touch the bread, I will just get very ill a few hours later, for several days, and they won't know about it. So whatever belief they might have had about it ""just being a preference"" will be confirmed, and they won't take it seriously the next time either.

How does the rest of the UK gluten intolerant population handle this? Do you attempt to explain the difference and hope they don't roll their eyes at you? Do you just call it an allergy and hope they take you seriously? Do you make all your food at home and avoid the risk?  ",3,1758011900.0,glutenfreeuk,15,0.8,False

1nibxvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1nibxvj/the_neighbors_upstairs_are_constantly_drilling/,The neighbors upstairs are constantly drilling something.,"Ever since we moved in like 4 months ago, the neighbors upstairs who have never been quiet to begin with are constantly hammering or drilling something, and they especially love to do it on Saturday when people want to sleep in. We have always wondered what the hell they're doing upstairs since it is CONSTANT, ever since we moved in, at least once a week.

And now, it's gotten even worse. They left a note in the hallway asking for patience and understanding as they're apparently redoing their bathroom and it will take about two weeks. Every single day I am woken up by drilling right above my head that is so loud I can hear it through my ear plugs. I usually can't hear anything through them, but this is like someone is drilling through my brain. I'm disabled and chronically ill, I'm unemployed and my sleep schedule is completely messed up, so when I finally manage to fall asleep, I don't get more than a few hours until they wake me up. I think what I hate the most is that they drill in smaller increments, for like 20 minutes and then stop completely for the rest of the hour and then do it again.

I will share more about the story in time. For now, here is the first draft of Chapter 1 \[PS - there will be a prologue scene prior to this\]. 

I would love to hear your feedback. To receive future updates on this novel and all my works in general, feel free to follow me and r/NeilMannWrites :

**Chapter 1**

‚ÄúYou know what I like about you, Priya?‚Äù

I looked up at my boss, Ankan Banerjee, just as I was about to take a big bite out of my chicken roll. The afternoon sun streamed through the glass windows into the office, catching the faint streaks of grey at his temples. At thirty-six, Ankan carried himself with a thoughtful dignity that made him appear both approachable and authoritative. That image that people have of the typical gentleman ‚Äì Ankan is that man. His eyes, behind thin-framed spectacles, were a warm dark brown, always crinkling at the corners when he was about to make a point, as if he were sharing a secret with you alone. His features were calm and composed, with a gentle demeanour capable of introducing a sense of tranquillity to any room.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really hungry.‚Äù

I slowly put down my chicken roll on the table in front of me. There was a small grease stain that I hoped Ankan hadn‚Äôt noticed.

‚ÄúNo, no, not like that,‚Äù he almost jumped to clear any inadvertent misunderstanding. He had almost finished his double chicken roll already ‚Äì to be fair, he could eat way more than I ever could. ‚ÄúI mean, you are hungry to chase down important stories. The Salt Lake Mayor‚Äôs Club expos√© is a testament to your abilities and, more importantly, your tenacity.‚Äù

I relaxed and smiled at him while picking up my roll again. I felt a warmth of pride spread through my chest. ‚ÄúThank you, Ankan Da.‚Äù

We both shared a sense of pride and satisfaction over that expos√©. It was easily my biggest piece till date, and honestly, it had terrified me. For three weeks, I'd followed paper trails through municipal offices that reeked of stale cigarettes and corruption, interviewed entitled babus with strong political backing, and combed through financial records to eventually uncover a major corruption and extortion racket being run by a local party leader. The piece had been run on Tuesday. It was now Thursday, and the aftershocks were being felt across the city.

‚ÄúEven though it‚Äôs a big story,‚Äù I said, while digging back into my chicken roll. ‚ÄúMost people will never know exactly how big a deal it is.‚Äù

It was true. There had been plans to expand the racket across the state within a few months. Eventually, it could‚Äôve spread across the country. Multiple political parties had their dirty fingers in that pie. We‚Äôd uncovered evidence of connections that went to the very top of the hierarchy. Fortunately or unfortunately, we did not have enough proof to publish that. But the expos√© had, as far as we knew, put a halt to the entire operation.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Ankan smiled. ‚ÄúI know. You know. Maybe one day, we‚Äôll have the opportunity to tell others as well.‚Äù

I scoffed, my mouth half full. ‚ÄúI doubt it. It‚Äôs probably best if most people never know what a circus our nation is and what clowns those running it are.‚Äù

Fine, I was a bit disillusioned with everything at the moment. It wasn‚Äôt like I did not know the state of corruption in our country. I wasn‚Äôt living under a rock. But seeing it at such close quarters for the first time, feeling the weight of implied threats whispered through anonymous phone calls, watching powerful men casually discuss destroying lives over lunch‚Ä¶ it had left an impact.

In truth, I was fortunate to be working with Ankan and The Feed. Most of my college friends had either given up on journalism altogether or were grinding out SEO-optimized clickbait for media houses that had sold their souls long ago.

Ankan had started The Feed as a simple blog site back in 2020, bang in the middle of the pandemic. He was the only writer back then, publishing investigative pieces from his one-bedroom flat in Jadavpur while the world fell apart around us.

It still astounds me how he managed to grow The Feed into a website with tens of thousands of daily readers. Journalism is dead or, at the very least, dying in India. All major media outlets have essentially become mouthpieces of the political establishment. Some bent willingly to the political will for simple monetary benefits. Some were bought over by businessmen or industrialists who are in bed with the ruling establishment. Others were forced to bend following more heavy-handed coercion.

Journalism is a dying art globally as well ‚Äì thank you, Google! Quality journalism is not profitable anymore. It‚Äôs all about the SEO now, following the whims of Google‚Äôs stupid algorithm. Media houses have to play Google‚Äôs game, ensuring at every step that they never run afoul of their holy algorithm.

Before joining The Feed, I had interviewed with another media outlet that cheerfully informed me I would have to pump out 60 articles every month. If you‚Äôre thinking they had a few screws loose, you are not alone. I had had that thought too, and told them as much. The response was I do not need to produce high-quality articles because it was an SEO growth project, and what was most important was producing a high volume of articles with the right keywords, which I would have been promptly provided by their overpaid SEO team. And the infuriating thing is, this approach has become the norm across the media industry, because it‚Äôs what makes money and polishes up the quarterly balance sheet.

It was precisely in this environment that Ankan started The Feed. From the beginning, he never shied away from inflammatory or controversial topics. If he felt something merited attention, he dove in headfirst. He faced a lot of pushback, a few subtle threats from powerful people, an avalanche of not-so-subtle threats ‚Äì including straight up death threats ‚Äì from a constant army of Government-backed social media trolls, organized smear campaigns designed to discredit him, and a lot more. Somehow, he fought through it all, The Feed kept growing and eventually, he was able to hire others to join his mission.

I‚Äôd been fortunate enough to join The Feed in September 2023. Technically, I was still on probation and did not have a permanent contract yet.

There were 13 of us presently, including Ankan. We were working in a hybrid model. Work from home was actively encouraged. To be honest, the three-room office in a converted garage in Ballygunge got pretty cramped if everyone showed up on the same day, which thankfully rarely happened.

Things changed in April 2024 when The Feed received funding worth 6 crore rupees. I still remember the day Ankan had gathered us all in the cramped office, grinning like a kid who'd just been handed the keys to a chocolate factory. For the first time, he had funds to spare. We would move to a bigger office space next year. More personnel would be hired, too. Most importantly, Ankan could pursue stories without financial barriers and protect his staff better. That protection was incredibly valuable given that we didn‚Äôt shy away from any story.

Earlier in the month, Hassan ‚Äì amazing guy, tremendous journalist, and most importantly, the best biryani chef I‚Äôve met ‚Äì had written an extended piece on the recent electoral bonds scam. The day the piece was published, a popular Twitter account sympathetic to the Central Government and followed by members of the ruling party, posted a picture of Hassan accompanied by his full name, address and email, followed by the caption, ‚ÄúSo these antinationals are the people who write such articles for The Feed‚Äù. The implication was clear. They were attacking Hassan‚Äôs religion, his identity as a Muslim. The reply section was inundated with death threats from troll accounts: ‚ÄúWe know where you live now‚Äù, ‚ÄúBe careful on your next morning walk‚Äù ‚Äì for context, several journalists who have not sufficiently towed the Government narrative have been killed on morning walks in recent years.

We were used to this by now. It was intimidation, meant to shut down any straying voices. It was still unnerving every time it happened, but at The Feed, we had kind of accepted that we would need to deal with such things on a regular basis. But this time turned out different. This time, the noise stopped within a couple of days. Ankan‚Äôs policy usually was that if an article elicited personal threats, the person on the receiving end would lay off overly controversial topics for a couple of weeks. Hassan, because of his religion, was considered particularly vulnerable and had been temporarily taken off sensitive assignments before. But this time, Ankan had just smiled and told him, ‚ÄúKeep up the good work, you‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù

And he had been. We realised the investor money was a game-changer. We were playing in a higher league now, with resources to match Ankan‚Äôs ‚Äì and our ‚Äì ambitions.

‚ÄúYeah, a story like that can be overwhelming,‚Äù Ankan laughed, finishing his roll and wiping his hands on a paper napkin. ‚ÄúI have an easier lead for you now.‚Äù

I frowned. Ankan had decided that I should focus on some smaller and easier stories for a while. I recognised he was looking out for me and I appreciated that. But I still wasn‚Äôt thrilled about it.

""You know I appreciate the concern, but I didn't get into journalism to write easy puff pieces,"" I said, unable to keep the frustration out of my voice.

Ankan chuckled. ""Trust me, this is valuable work and I need someone I can trust to do a job with it.‚Äù

Ankan had a little pet project ‚Äì one of a gazillion, honestly ‚Äì where he wanted to bring to light a lot of the social work going on throughout Bengal. He not only wanted to bring the spotlight on these activities, but also hoped that it would firstly, encourage more people to get involved with social work, and secondly, drum up interest to get more funding for the social organisations.

He leaned forward, and I could see the sincerity in his eyes. ""Look, Priya, corruption stories are important, but so are the people fighting the honest fight at the grassroots level. Sometimes, it‚Äôs more valuable to shine a light on what's actually working than to expose the darkness.""

I sighed. He had a point. Or maybe he was just good with words. Probably both. ""Okay, what‚Äôs your lead?""

Ankan reached into his backpack and fished out the battered Classmate notebook he took everywhere. I had spent decades of my life across school and college filling these Classmate notebooks. Now, the mere sight of them just gave me PTSD.

The edges of the notebook were curled, corners dog-eared, the cover dotted with the occasional coffee stain. He turned a couple of pages with his forefinger and drew out a crumpled sheet that he slid across the table towards me.

I scanned through column after column of names, hand-inked, some underlined, almost all unfamiliar. ‚ÄúSrimani Youth Initiative‚Äù, ‚ÄúEast Bengal Care Society‚Äù, ‚ÄúPadma Ladies‚Äô Trust‚Äù. My eyes snagged on a neat, English phrase wedged near the bottom right, circled and written in slightly larger letters. It was clearly meant to catch the eye. ‚ÄúBright Futures International School.‚Äù

‚ÄúEuropean NGO,‚Äù Ankan said, noticing where my gaze had settled. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got solid funding these days. The school is in Salt Lake, Sector III. Their students are mostly orphans and underprivileged kids. I would recommend you start there, the principal‚Äôs supposed to be very hands-on.‚Äù

A rooster call interrupted the conversation. Ankan smiled, he was familiar with my WhatsApp message tone by now. I glanced briefly at my phone. ‚ÄúMa‚Äù, I announced, bracing myself. I had a feeling I knew what was coming as I opened my WhatsApp.

Right on cue, there was a photo of a grinning, nerdy-looking guy about my age in a plaid shirt, arms awkwardly at his sides, posing next to a car. The caption underneath was, ‚ÄúLooks settled and good job in IT! I showed him your photo.‚Äù

My parents had gone into overdrive, my mom even more so. I was twenty-eight already, and they had to get me hitched with a nice man before I turned into an old unmarriageable hag in two years‚Äô time.

I let my phone drop back onto the table, screen down. ‚ÄúI swear, Ankan Da, I don‚Äôt know what to do with these photos. She tells me nothing except ‚Äògood job‚Äô every single time.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it is, and you know it,‚Äù he said, grinning. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her get to you. And don‚Äôt worry about the ‚Äòget married before thirty‚Äô deadline, lots of people are getting married after thirty nowadays.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. But,‚Äù I lifted my arms for dramatic effect. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told her this. Telling me a guy has a job or a degree tells me nothing about the guy. She keeps sending me nouns, I need at least some adjectives for crying out loud.‚Äù

\*\*\*

A couple of hours later, I was hunched over my Lenovo ThinkPad in the stuffier-than-usual chaos of the Ballygunge office. While outside, a typical humid Kolkata afternoon crawled past to the tune of persistent honking, inside our garage-turned-newsroom, I found the energy oddly soothing ‚Äì the clack of Chandan‚Äôs frantic typing in one corner, the sweet-salty whiff of milky tea brewing somewhere or the other, the faint echo of a biscuit packet rustling open. I felt comfortable here, in my element as they say.

I typed ‚ÄúBright Futures International School‚Äù into Google, expecting some grainy photos or dry PDFs. Instead, I was directed to a slick website with a modern design ‚Äì soft blues, international logos, pictures of children smiling beneath polka-dot banners. Their mission statement read like it had been run through five PR rinses. ‚ÄúEmpowering global youth through holistic, student-led approaches in a digital-first world‚Äù. As a journalist, I recognised it for what it was ‚Äì fashionable words with zero substance.

Sudip, our hairy, sardonic features editor, ambled by clutching the battered office kettle. He peered over my shoulder, grinning. ‚ÄúAh, look! Our star reporter is slumming it with the softies. So what‚Äôs next on your agenda ‚Äì annual day at a Montessori?‚Äù

I gave him my most withering stare. ‚ÄúAt least they‚Äôll give me a juice and Winkies for my troubles.‚Äù I turned back to the screen. It was all extremely neat ‚Äì glossy videos, staged testimonials, even some drone footage. But there was zero specificity on what they actually did.

After nearly fifteen minutes, I finally found a half-hidden mention in some local e-paper. Six months ago, Bright Futures had received a ‚Äúsignificant international donation to initiate a special arts program for underprivileged children.‚Äù The article was just a fluff paragraph accompanied by a photo of serious-looking men shaking hands.

In my experience, the more real money was involved, the less anyone wanted to say.

I jotted the phrase ""special arts program"" at the top of my notepad, next to a fresh grease stain from the earlier chicken roll. I really had to work on my roll eating technique as we seemed to do that a lot here. Just one of those occupational hazards of working at The Feed!",2,1758011693.0,NeilMannWrites,0,1.0,False

* Tremor Tusk
* Apex Tremor Tusk
* Apex Thunderjaw
* Apex Slitherfang

I wore a level 4 Tenakth Dragoon (Machine Master) for buffing it.

I only fought the Tremortusk with this little Kodiak of mine for testing it out.

He slaughtered the rest of list with ease in **single combat**.¬†While Aloy sat in the nearby bushes and me on the bed with a coffee mug in my hands.

Jesus...what an amazing design!

A morsel before breakfast, to soothe the waking up.  
A sprinkle in your pap, like rain upon the soil.  
A clutch with your ten o‚Äôclock coffee, bold as a bell.  
A powdered dusting across your sandwich, hidden strength at noon.  
A few slices with your afternoon coffee, shadows lengthening.  
A portion beside your dinner, steady as bread and salt.  
A sliver with your evening tea, soft as twilight‚Äôs hush.  
A midnight mouthful, secret as a thief of dreams.",2,1758010442.0,Biltong,0,1.0,False
