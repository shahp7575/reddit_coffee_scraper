1qxe423,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1qxe423/i_found_boozed_through_the_ages_in_a_dumpster/,"I found ""Boozed Through The Ages"" in a dumpster behind my university library","So I'm a grad student working on my thesis about historical narratives and academic gatekeeping (riveting stuff, I know), and last week I'm taking out recycling behind the campus library when I spot this book in the dumpster.

It's called ""[Boozed Through The Ages](https://a.co/d/0jj6VPfs): A Slurry of History from a Shitfaced Scholar"" by Arthur Vandelay. The cover's stained with what I HOPE is coffee and bourbon. There's a Post-it note on it that says ""UNACCEPTABLE FOR CIRCULATION - Dr. Peterson.""

I take it home. I start reading. It's a drunk history professor narrating 14 billion years of human civilization from various dive bars while his editor (Brenda) leaves increasingly desperate notes in the margins trying to stop him from getting sued.

This man calls the Crusades ""My Invisible Friend is Better Than Yours"" and describes the Industrial Revolution as ""Children in the Gears."" He gets progressively drunker through each chapter. By the French Revolution he's drinking absinthe. By the Cold War he's been kicked out of his original bar and moved to a place called ""The Gutter Lounge.""

The historical facts are ACTUALLY ACCURATE though? Like between the profanity and bar fights, he's citing real sources? His chapter on Mesopotamia has better analysis than my $400 textbook?

I mentioned it to my thesis advisor yesterday. She went pale and said ""Where did you find that?"" Apparently Dr. Peterson (yeah, THAT Peterson who threw it away) tried to fire a professor three years ago for assigning it to undergraduates.

I'm using it as a primary source in my thesis about why academic history writing is deliberately boring. My advisor says I'm ""committing career suicide"" but also asked to borrow it.

The scooter was still there. The keys were safe.

PAPER EVERYTHING

ditch google calendar- you NEED to be able to see what is due and prioritise, get a paper semester calendar from uni or a year long wall calendar and write down every quiz, assignment, exam, social event, appointment, tutorial, training day and public holiday.  PUT it directly above your desk so you’re face to face with it everyday.

HAND WRITTEN NOTES- if you want typed notes scribble notes in lectures and go back home afterwards and use your scribbles to remind you what you learnt then fill in with the lecture slides

Physical flashcards- active recall is the best medicine for a leaky mind, hand the deck to your partner, study buddy, mum, dad, sister, brother! bonus points if you use past papers to format the questions- ai can be helpful but use critical thinking and use it for ideas. however you don’t have to reinvent the wheel, google course code-quizlet and someone may have created a very useful resource already

DUE DATES

if you are burnt out do the bare minimum, 

QUIZ- that 5 point multiple choice quiz with 10 questions can be the difference between passing and failing, don’t overlook it, so again write down the due dates, if it’s a recurring quiz do it the same time every week.

assignment- put the prompt through AI, get it to format and create a reference list. Then using your brain write the assignment based off the format annnd google the reference- it likely doesn’t exist but it will direct you to a reliable source that you can read and site- and REFERENCE AS YOU GO!!!! PLEASE!!!!! If you’re procrastination king write one sentence the day it comes out… trust the motivation of one sentence is wild.

EXAMS

Past papers are your best friend, do all of them, there usually 3-5 available from previous years. if this is all you do you will probably pass

spend time talking to teachers they want to help ask them for guidance and direction in your revision 

listen ALL THE TIME. recorded lectures, youtube summaries, audiobooks, this will be your best chance to passively study in between active study, it will consolidate what you’ve already learnt, and prime you for what you’re going to learn. if you’re driving, working out, walking between classes, cooking, cleaning or in the shower, stack the task make it a chance to revise or prime with very little effort. 

ROMANCE- 

HOME-light a candle, pour a glass of champagne or a mug of warm coffee, dimly lit room, wrapt up in a blanket. get cozy with your laptop and notes and trust you’ll concentrate bc you’re senses aren’t overwhelmed and you’re still getting the dopamine. 

CAFE- cute fit, favourite coffee order, favourite pastry, and your headphones, perfect motivation 

library- comfy cloths and fully charged laptops, study group with friends is accountability.

CONCLUSION

there are more effective methods but this is what worked for me, math/coding/practical subjects will require you to sit down and practice but content heavy subjects like anatomy shouldn’t be hard, just time consuming with lots of revision. 

Spaced repetition, regular exercise, 7-10hours of sleep, balanced meals (with fruit, veg, protein, healthy fats), socialising and time for hobbies are essential for success. when i was studying to be a vet (i transferred after some terrible placement), i had a 5.8gpa (7pt scale), worked two jobs (30ish hours total) and never missed a deadline.

When I first met him, I actually found him pretty annoying because he micromanaged everything I did at work. Instead of taking it personally, though, I tried to learn from it. I worked harder, became more focused, and over time we started bonding over how much we both worked.

Since I don’t know how to drive, he eventually started giving me rides home. My parents would complain about picking me up late or not knowing exactly when I’d be done, so his help made things a lot easier for me. Those rides slowly turned into conversations, driving lessons, and hanging out as friends. That went on for about 9 months, and we got really comfortable around each other.

Later on, my relationship with my parents got really strained, and they stopped giving me rides to school and work altogether. I felt stuck and overwhelmed, and when I vented to him about it, he took the initiative to help. He started picking me up for college, taking me to work, and bringing me home. He didn’t make me feel like I was asking for too much, which meant a lot to me. He would always say “Stop overthinking, you are not a burden to me.”

To help take my mind off things, he’d take me out to eat or grab coffee with me, and we’d talk about life, work, and whatever was going on. Before work we’d go to bakeries or cafés, and after work we’d sit in his car, rant about our shifts, or watch YouTube. It all felt very natural and easy, and that’s when I realized how close we had become.

One day, after I got into a bad fight with a coworker who was also my friend, I broke down while talking to him. He helped me think through how I might fix the situation and how to rekindle our friendship, and during that moment we ended up cuddling for the first time. After a bit of silence, he asked me if it was true that I liked him. I hadn’t planned on admitting it, but I said “yeah”. He told me he liked me too and asked what I wanted to do moving forward. I honestly didn’t know.

He said we could be boyfriend and girlfriend if that’s what I wanted, but he made it clear he didn’t want to pressure me. He said the decision was completely up to me and that he’d give me time. For now, he suggested something like friends with benefits, but with the intention of still going out together and being affectionate. I agreed.

The next day, everything felt surprisingly normal. He took me to work like usual, and I liked that sense of normalcy. After work, we cuddled again and ended up hooking up. Since it was my first time, I enjoyed it, but afterward I felt a little unsure and started wondering if that was always his intention or if I was overthinking it.

Still, today he took me out again to eat, to a bakery, and then shopping and he treated me the same way he always has… respectful, attentive, and kind. It didn’t feel awkward or distant, which made me even more confused about what I should do.

I really care about him, and I can see him in my future. Our long-term goals line up we both want marriage, a family, and to eventually move out and build a life. At the same time, I can’t ignore the concerns. The age gap worries me, working together complicates things, and relationships at work technically aren’t allowed, even though we’re close with management and they’d likely be okay with it as long as it doesn’t affect work.

I feel kinda torn between what feels right emotionally and what makes sense logically. I don’t know if pursuing this would be a mistake or something meaningful, and that uncertainty is what’s been weighing on me the most. :(",1,1770373166.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone, Ray here from GadgetHyper. Since the Vader 5 Pro hit the scene last November, it's been a bit of a hot topic in our community. While the controller itself is a beast, the stock back buttons have definitely sparked some... let's call it ""passionate debate."" Some of you found the ergonomics a bit off, and others were genuinely worried about the long-term durability of the plastic.

I've previously shared my thoughts on the official Flydigi ""Blade"" buttons and those sturdy metal 3rd-party replacements (you can catch that recap here). But today, I'm shifting gears. A fellow enthusiast recently pointed me toward a boutique shop specializing in 3D-printed (FDM) mods. I couldn't resist—I bought the entire catalog: 4 back button designs and 8 D-pad variations.

**Full Disclosure:** These are my ""first impressions."" I haven't spent weeks with each one yet, but I wanted to give you a quick ""coffee-table chat"" style breakdown of how they feel right out of the box.

# Part 1: The Back Button Experiments1. The ""Long"" Version (Maximum Leverage)

https://preview.redd.it/6fdlgg1aluhg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efcc2003e8a9cd4efd19094fb1266eab17e38f02

# 1. The ""Long"" Version (Maximum Leverage)The Feel

https://preview.redd.it/641gjwegluhg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5c7ac435f9a3fb20582244628515d4789e6c0ca

**The Feel**

This one immediately stands out. It extends perfectly to where your middle finger naturally rests. The leverage is fantastic, giving you an incredibly crisp, tactile click.

**The Trade-off**

Being FDM-printed, tolerances can be a bit finicky. On my unit, the right button has a slight downward ""wobble"" when pressed. It's not a dealbreaker, but it's there. Also, while it technically doesn't block M1/M2, using your ring finger to reach around it feels a bit ""un-ergonomic"" for most hand sizes.

# 2. The ""Medium"" Version (The Balanced Choice)

https://preview.redd.it/zlzx870kmuhg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63f71cd9842b42df2a4fd9268a63c389938c4000

**The Feel**

This is probably the ""Goldilocks"" zone. It provides enough surface area for a solid middle-finger grip, but because it's shorter, you can easily pivot your finger to hit M1/M2 without feeling like you're doing finger gymnastics.

**The Trade-off**

The tactile snap feels just a hair softer than the ""Long"" version, likely due to the different physics of the shorter lever.

# 3. The ""Short"" Version (The Minimalist)

https://preview.redd.it/biinesunmuhg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=727865c2e84c116aa5579c092d0835aa67c74b31

**The Feel**

These remind me a lot of the PS5 DualSense Edge or the Beitong KP series—small, rounded nubs.

**The Reality**

If you have smaller hands like mine, this might be a tough sell. My fingers only barely touch the very top edge of the button. To get a proper press, I have to shift my entire grip forward, which honestly takes away from the comfort of the Vader 5 Pro's excellent shell.

# 4. The ""Stock+"" (Standard Shape)

https://preview.redd.it/4hl41dirmuhg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdd8b12938d9f891cc781749bddb20cfb7d1ed41

**The Feel**

This design is very similar to the original Flydigi layout but with an ""upward-flare"" design. It's meant for players who prefer a traditional 4-finger back-button grip.

**The Reality**

While it feels familiar, I found the spacing between M3/M4 and M1/M2 to be a bit too tight. I ended up with more accidental ""double-presses"" on this set than any of the others.

* ⚠️ **Quick Note on Logistics:** If you use the official charging dock, please note that none of these (except the ""Stock+"" version) will fit on the dock while installed. On the bright side, the FDM material feels surprisingly robust—not nearly as ""brittle"" as I initially feared.

# Part 2: The D-Pad Buffet (8 Styles)

I've categorized these into ""The Classics"" and ""The Quirky Ones.""

https://preview.redd.it/8saoayjymuhg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b36e6560c3911efb256d9f07473386e07b8b38ce

# The ""Classic"" Clones (Top 4)

These are essentially 3D-printed homages to the Xbox Elite-style D-pads.

**The Verdict**

If you love that concave, satellite-dish feel, you'll be right at home. They are great for general navigation. However, for fighting game enthusiasts (Street Fighter, I'm looking at you), the FDM texture can feel a little ""slick"" during high-intensity quarter-circle inputs.

# The ""Special"" Editions (Bottom 4)

**The ""Deep Dish""**

https://preview.redd.it/xi7xfw82nuhg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=718265e13a557452938fc3af3cdbc4ded30305ee

This is the star of the show. The inward curve is much more pronounced than the others, almost ""cradling"" your thumb. It provides excellent directional feedback and feels incredibly agile.

**The ""DIAMOND"" & ""Cross""**

https://preview.redd.it/wowdo1v5nuhg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c120d70dce94004c5233ea0ad6eabe3d672f5709

To be honest, these were a bit underwhelming. The ""Diamond"" one feels a bit too much like pressing a blank tile—no clear directional tactile feedback. The ""Cross"" is a standard design we've seen everywhere; it's functional, but doesn't really ""add"" anything to the experience.

**The ""Oreo""**

https://preview.redd.it/jlgcpby7nuhg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5ee041bab7c266d1b19d96736866e2053341447

Okay, I have to give the designer props for the humor here! It's literally a D-pad with Oreo cookie textures. While it looks hilarious and provides massive grip, it's a bit ""scratchy"" on the thumb. I'd call this one a ""fun conversation starter"" rather than a daily driver.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, that's the beauty of the controller community—seeing how independent creators try to solve the little ""issues"" we have with our favorite gear. While not every one of these 12 pieces is a home run, they offer a level of customization that's really exciting to explore.

I hope this quick look helps you decide which direction you might want to go with your own Vader 5 Pro. I'm always hanging out in the comments, so if you have questions about the texture, the fit, or how they compare to the metal versions, let's chat below!

Thanks for reading, and happy gaming.

I have a good relationship with my parents but not super close, and I was an only child. For my entire life all I’ve ever wanted is to have one person to do things with, talk to, go to the beach, grab food, see a movie, anything. I have core friends from childhood (8-10 year friendships) but after 15yrs old or so I’ve asked them regularly (I’m not pushy at all I would hate to be around someone that doesn’t want to be around me) to hangout and will maybe get a yes a couple times a year. I get that people are busy, I am too, but I lived with two of my friends recently (both known one close with for 8 years)  for a year and they couldn’t even cut 10 minutes out of their day to have a conversation with me, and I would ask them regularly. On top of a few of them regularly hangout out with all their other friends but never implying in any way that they’re uninterested in being friends or behaving differently in conversation with me.

(Everyone in my life forgets my birthday or gets the wrong day at least once every 2 years as well ?)

I’d like to add that throughout my life I’ve made friends extremely easily in bigger city’s or places with more diversity .

None of my friends like to do any activities, all of them prefer to lay in bed on their phones, and will act miserable if they’re forced to do anything outside of that with me so I don’t even bother and have spent years settling doing nothing with them, but am pretty independent so I end up alone doing the things I’d prefer to do most of the time, not that they hangout with me anyway.  

I’ve never made a friend that likes to do the same things as me (except one and our personality’s clashed) and I don’t think my hobbies are abnormal. I like to thrift, have picnics, see music venues or concerts, hike, camp, day trips, night drives, find new food spots, reading, truly anything besides sitting at home. 

I’ve prayed every day for a year now and subconsciously my entire life and still not a single friend. I have no one to talk to, everyone acts like I don’t exist. 

I’ve asked multiple times through the years why I’m pushed to the side and had a couple sit down conversations when it got bad, but it always results in dodgy non- answers. I put all my effort into being nice to everyone and loving and attentive toward my people without being a push over or allowing myself to be disrespected. I love giving compliments (bc my friends are gorgeous and amazing) gifts, quality time (of course) I’m super accountable and would always prefer to fix the situation and communicate. Im not perfect of course and I have my moments but not any more than anyone else does or they do by any means ? 

I’ve tried hobbies, churches, music shows, every outside group I can get into w out being a pro athlete. No one wants to be more than instagram mutuals and maybe get coffee each solstice. 

I also am a black woman and live in a small secluded majority white town and get profiled + racist experiences regularly so I’m planning on moving sometime this year to a city outside of LA to hopefully get more diversity ? I’m not visually political which I feel is important to note with that context. I’ve felt crazy and alone anytime I’m not traveling to a big city- has anyone gone through this or is this one of those blind posts where they clearly are the problem ?? Please I need honesty 🤍",4,1770372813.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

The results are drinkable, but it feels odd that I have to stay at 19, which seems fairly coarse. If I go any finer than that, I barely get any flow at all (sometimes even no espresso at all) when pulling a shot.

Getting around the city is just too hard.  Phucket felt overated and I just don't like Chiang Mai at all.

If Thailand was closer I'd come back for a much shorter time. It just didn't provide a good enough experience at a good enough value to justify a 22 hour flight by itself.  Now I understand why so many people seem to be here as a part of touring Asia. 

The small business owners are very very pushy. I probably would have spent even more money but I honestly felt harassed in many small shops.  They do not allow you to browse in peace.  

It's not a bad place but it seems overrated. People kept talking to me like it is a cheap paradise. It's not that cheap.  Outside from its natural beauty, which is amazing but not unique, it's far from a paradise.  I'd sit on a plane for 16 hours for paradise, but not for Thailand.

Heck I was somewhere once and they added sugar to plane water.  8 year old me would have loved it.  Just a pitcher of sugar water. I used it in my coffee to cool it down.

1qxdquc,https://www.reddit.com/r/famouschaliz/comments/1qxdquc/the_heartbeat_of_the_island_coffees_sacred_role/,The Heartbeat of the Island Coffee’s Sacred Role _,"

To speak of Jamaica is to invoke a symphony of sensations: the rhythm of reggae, the warmth of the sun, the scent of salt air and spice. Yet, woven into the very fabric of the island’s identity, rising with the mist into the Blue Mountains, is the deep, profound aroma of coffee. Here, coffee is more than a morning ritual; it is a cultural touchstone, an agricultural legacy, and a source of national pride that resonates far beyond the cup.

Jamaica’s relationship with coffee is a story written in geography and history. The journey began in the 18th century when coffee was first cultivated, finding its destiny in the unique terroir of the Blue Mountains. These peaks, some soaring over 7,000 feet, provide the ideal conditions for coffee magic. Cool, misty mornings give way to sunny afternoons, while volcanic soil, rich and well-drained, nourishes the beans. This slow, deliberate maturation at high altitude allows for a complex development of sugars and acids, creating a profile that is the antithesis of bitterness. The result is a liquor celebrated worldwide for its extraordinary smoothness, bright acidity, and nuanced flavors—notes of mild chocolate, sweet herbs, and a clean, almost floral finish. It is a coffee that doesn’t shout but rather, whispers its elegance.

This cultivation is not merely an industry; it is a testament to patience and craftsmanship. The steep, rugged terrain defies large-scale mechanization, meaning much of the work, from planting to selective picking, is done by hand, passed down through generations of farmers. This intimate, human connection to the land infuses the crop with a value that transcends economics. Coffee farming supports communities, preserves a way of life, and sustains the breathtaking landscape that defines the island’s interior. It is a pillar of rural life and a cherished heritage.

When the conversation turns to the pinnacle of this heritage, one name is spoken with reverence: Blue Mountain Coffee. This is not merely a brand but an appellation, a legally protected designation for coffee grown in a specific region at specific elevations. It is a standard of excellence guarded with fierce pride. Among the estates that produce this legendary coffee, one consistently stands as the benchmark for quality and prestige: Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee from the Wallenford Estate. For centuries, Wallenford has been synonymous with the very best of the harvest. Their coffee embodies the ideal—a perfectly balanced, aromatic, and mild cup that has captivated connoisseurs and royalty alike, becoming the most sought-after and iconic representation of Jamaica’s coffee crown.

To enjoy a cup of genuine Blue Mountain coffee, especially from a legacy estate like Wallenford, is to taste the essence of Jamaica itself. It is to taste the care of the farmer, the kiss of the mountain mist, and the patience of a slow-growing bean. It is a luxurious experience, yes, but also a deeply authentic one. It connects you to the soul of the island in a way no other product can. In Jamaica, coffee is not just a drink. It is a story of place, a labor of love, and a quiet, steaming testament to the fact that the island’s greatest treasures are often grown, not mined. It is, in every sense, the heartbeat of the highlands, a rhythm as steady and vital as the reggae that drifts from the coast below.",1,1770372480.0,famouschaliz,0,1.0,False

I was at a small family gathering, nothing fancy,  just coffee, snacks, people half watching TV. At some point someone asked what my plans were for the next few years. Not rude, not loaded, just casual. I said I dont really have a big plan, I like how my life looks right now. There was this small pause, like a buffering moment. Someone  smiled and said “wow must be nice to have no real responsabilities”. They even laughed a bit, but it felt off, like I’d said the wrong line in a play. 

After that I started noticing how differently we talk about time. Everything for them is framed around “later”. Later this, after that, once something else happens. Conversations always jump ahead. For me, now is already the point. I plan small trips, quiet weekends, random hobbies I might drop in a month. I enjoy  empty evenings. When I talked about that, it sounded to them like I was floating with no direction. To me it felt full, intentional, enough. Same words, totally different meaning. .

That moment stuck with  me more than any obvious bingo ever did. There was no judgement, no pressure, just a quiet disconnect. They genuinely couldnt imagine a life that isnt constantly preparing for the next role. And I  walked away feeling strangely calm. For the first time it clicked that my version of normal isnt missing a chapter, its just written on a different timeline.

I took a screenshot of a random attractive woman I found on Pinterest. Instead of describing her manually, I clicked the “Image to Prompt” button directly inside the prompt textarea (there’s literally a button for it).

No written description. No editing. No guiding the AI.

Just upload → Image to Prompt → generate.

It automatically analyzed the image and wrote a full technical prompt: lighting, lens type, skin details, facial structure, vibe, styling everything.

Then I used that exact generated prompt to recreate the image.

The recreation was honestly scary close.

What impressed me:

It captured the exact Pinterest aesthetic.

The lighting breakdown was way more detailed than I would’ve written.

It understood the influencer vibe without me typing a single word.

For people who struggle with writing good prompts, this feels kind of broken.

Here’s the exact prompt it generated:

A high-resolution, full-body mirror selfie with a vertical orientation, captured with a professional-grade smartphone camera, exhibiting a fashion editorial aesthetic. The central focus is a young woman with a slender, toned physique and an hourglass silhouette, standing in a classical interior. She has long, straight, dark hair parted in the middle that cascades down her shoulders. Her face features a refined bone structure with high cheekbones and a defined jawline. Her expression is subtle, with slightly parted lips and a direct gaze toward her reflection in the mirror. She holds a large, white-backed smartphone with a multi-lens camera array in her left hand, positioned at chest height, while her right hand is raised near her face with fingers lightly touching her chin and lips, showcasing long, almond-shaped manicured nails in a soft pink hue.

The subject is wearing a coordinated two-piece ensemble in an antique gold and bronze palette. The top is a strapless, tight-fitting, low-cut corset-style bodice that accentuates the bust. It is constructed from intricate floral lace and sheer mesh, embellished with 3D fabric flowers, sequins, and small pearls that catch the light. The bottom is a matching low-rise mini skirt made of a textured, shimmering metallic fabric with horizontal rushing and a raw, scalloped hemline that sits low on the hips. Her skin has a smooth, sun-kissed tan with soft highlights on the collarbones and shoulders, reflecting the ambient indoor light.

The setting is a luxurious, traditionally styled room. Behind the subject is a large, white-painted ornate fireplace mantel with neoclassical moldings. On the mantel sit decorative brass or bronze candle holders. To the left, a dark wood cabinet with shutter-style doors is visible. In the background, a low-profile velvet or suede chair in a deep rose or mauve tone sits on a large, intricately patterned Persian rug featuring deep reds, blues, and creams. A circular glass-topped coffee table with a decorative wrought-iron base is positioned in the mid-ground. The lighting is soft and diffused, likely from an overhead source or large window, creating gentle shadows that define the subject’s musculature and the textures of the fabrics. The color temperature is warm, emphasizing the gold tones of the outfit and the rich woods of the furniture. The depth of field is slightly shallow, keeping the subject in sharp focus while the background elements have a soft, natural blur. The overall image quality is sharp with minimal noise, characteristic of a high-end mobile sensor in well-lit conditions.",7,1770372031.0,AiGeminiPhotoPrompts,1,1.0,False

Honestly I love how it makes me feel, kinda just feels like a strong cup of coffee that persists all day but it also makes me a worse person.

I have some other bad addictions like gambling & smoking weed & when I take Vyvanse it seems like those amp up to a level which I would never have gotten to without Vyvanse. I feel like Vyvanse completely strips the ""consequence"" side of my brain. Even if I know something is bad, I will just completely overlook it with 0 remorse.

This has led to me losing unfathomable amounts of money gambling,(Basically everything at this point) & feeling so angry that I can't sleep, eat or talk to people. I snap at the smallest things when I've always been a very shy and timid person & while the anger does come from losing money gambling, it also feels amplified 50x by Vyvanse where I will scream at someone for every being in my way.

Currently as I write this I've been awake for 3 days straight with no sleep, I've taken 140mg of Vyvanse everyday for those 3 days plus 2 monster energy drinks & a shit ton of coffee. Part of me is addicted to the stress & high heart rate & chaotic lifestyle but I also hate everything at the same time. But even though I hate the person I've become on Vyvanse, I absolutely love the way it makes me feel. Feeling angry all the time doesn't sound ideal but on Vyvanse I just feel electric & unstoppable. Almost like no one can fuck with me & I feel intimidating.

ome notes on the last few achievements I got:

Prairie King & Fector's Challenge: It wasn't too bad, although I quit and saved after every boss. It made it kind of fun because it reminded me of playing a soulslike and running back to the tavern every time I died (I bought the key to the city so I could enter before 12pm).

Craft Master: This was easily the most annoying for me simply because I didn't realize there was an option in settings to have your crafting menu show how many of an item you have crafted. I spent way too much time crafting things and running back to the walnut room to see if the % had changed before I realized there was a setting I could toggle.

Joja: I just don't like this achievement because I would never choose to do the Joja route, so being forced to replay a new save for hours just to get the last achievement was just tedious and boring since I was so used to having all of my tool upgrades and all of my extra movement speed with horse/books/coffee. This one achievement felt more grindy than my entire normal playthrough ever felt. The movement speed on a new save is brutally frustrating when you've spent the last two weeks playing the game with everything that remedies that.

I took a screenshot of a random attractive woman I found on Pinterest. Instead of describing her manually, I clicked the “Image to Prompt” button directly inside the prompt textarea (there’s literally a button for it).

No written description.
No editing.
No guiding the AI.

Just upload → Image to Prompt → generate.

It automatically analyzed the image and wrote a full technical prompt: lighting, lens type, skin details, facial structure, vibe, styling everything.

Then I used that exact generated prompt to recreate the image.

The recreation was honestly scary close.

What impressed me:

It captured the exact Pinterest aesthetic.

The lighting breakdown was way more detailed than I would’ve written.

It understood the influencer vibe without me typing a single word.


For people who struggle with writing good prompts, this feels kind of broken.

Here’s the exact prompt it generated:

A high-resolution, full-body mirror selfie with a vertical orientation, captured with a professional-grade smartphone camera, exhibiting a fashion editorial aesthetic. The central focus is a young woman with a slender, toned physique and an hourglass silhouette, standing in a classical interior. She has long, straight, dark hair parted in the middle that cascades down her shoulders. Her face features a refined bone structure with high cheekbones and a defined jawline. Her expression is subtle, with slightly parted lips and a direct gaze toward her reflection in the mirror. She holds a large, white-backed smartphone with a multi-lens camera array in her left hand, positioned at chest height, while her right hand is raised near her face with fingers lightly touching her chin and lips, showcasing long, almond-shaped manicured nails in a soft pink hue.

The subject is wearing a coordinated two-piece ensemble in an antique gold and bronze palette. The top is a strapless, tight-fitting, low-cut corset-style bodice that accentuates the bust. It is constructed from intricate floral lace and sheer mesh, embellished with 3D fabric flowers, sequins, and small pearls that catch the light. The bottom is a matching low-rise mini skirt made of a textured, shimmering metallic fabric with horizontal rushing and a raw, scalloped hemline that sits low on the hips. Her skin has a smooth, sun-kissed tan with soft highlights on the collarbones and shoulders, reflecting the ambient indoor light.

The setting is a luxurious, traditionally styled room. Behind the subject is a large, white-painted ornate fireplace mantel with neoclassical moldings. On the mantel sit decorative brass or bronze candle holders. To the left, a dark wood cabinet with shutter-style doors is visible. In the background, a low-profile velvet or suede chair in a deep rose or mauve tone sits on a large, intricately patterned Persian rug featuring deep reds, blues, and creams. A circular glass-topped coffee table with a decorative wrought-iron base is positioned in the mid-ground. The lighting is soft and diffused, likely from an overhead source or large window, creating gentle shadows that define the subject’s musculature and the textures of the fabrics. The color temperature is warm, emphasizing the gold tones of the outfit and the rich woods of the furniture. The depth of field is slightly shallow, keeping the subject in sharp focus while the background elements have a soft, natural blur.

You could say that the 1st and 2nd albums show Yorushika’s musical direction extremely well.

That’s because, based on the foreshadowing and story about “reincarnation” built up through Mini Albums 1 and 2, they began creating a full-fledged concept album where the two male and female protagonists properly take center stage.

Oh, did you know? Elma and Amy from albums 1 and 2, and the “music thief” from album 3, all share connections.

I’m not sure whether I’ll write about the Mini Albums 1 and 2 later, but those mini albums tell the story of a man and a woman with a stubborn bond who end up separated by death for some reason, and then reunite after passing through many reincarnations.

In terms of the flow of time, the stories of albums 1 and 2 are one of the many reincarnation “routes” mentioned in Mini Album 2 (負け犬にアンコールはいらない).

Album Story.

A young man named Amy, who dreamed of becoming a pianist and a novelist but ultimately could not achieve his dreams.
And Elma, a woman who learns music, piano, and life from him.

Their story begins on a rainy day, at a café in Sekimachi, Tokyo.

On her way to her grandmother’s house, Elma takes shelter from a sudden rainstorm and enters a small nearby café.

There, Amy was exhausted from writing music on paper and had fallen asleep face-down on the table.

Elma, by chance, opens and looks at a sheet of music he had written—only to meet his eyes.

That is how they meet, and they become teacher and student.
Amy teaches Elma composition, how to write poetry, and how to play the piano. They spend time playing an upright piano near the station, or writing songs with a guitar at Amy’s home.

As time passes, Elma’s piano skills eventually surpass Amy’s, and Amy gradually distances himself from piano performance.

He holds Elma in high regard, often saying that he can see “moonlight” within her.

Meanwhile, Elma becomes increasingly dependent on Amy, and she starts to resemble him—his way of speaking, his mannerisms, even his writing style.

Amy even gave her the name “Elma” in the first place.

One day, Elma confides that she hates how weak she is. Amy takes the initial letters of her original name and names her “Elma,” encouraging her to become more confident.

They were bound together by an especially deep and tender bond—but one day, Amy leaves town without saying a word.
The reason was illness.

After being told he had a terminal condition, and realizing he had little time left, Amy quits his job, rents a room, and packs his belongings so he can live the remaining year as an artist.

With only a fountain pen and ink, a camera, an acoustic guitar, a wooden box containing poems and sheet music, and a single bottle of Paris green for the end.

he heads to Sweden, where he spent his childhood, to live out the final year of his life.

(It’s said that n-buna actually lived in Sweden during his childhood.)

Lund, Linköping, Stockholm, Gamla Stan, Gotland, Fårö,
and then back again to the docks of Stockholm.

Amy records the scenery of his travels through photographs, poems, and songs, and he writes letters to Elma containing his thoughts and memories.

On March 14, Amy begins his journey after writing the first letter.

Amy was an extremist aestheticist.
He firmly believed Oscar Wilde’s idea that “It’s not that art imitates life, but that life imitates art.”

To him, art wasn’t something that reflects or copies reality. It was something far too beautiful something that changes life, something that cannot even exist in reality.

That’s why Amy believed that “a god” dwells in a work.
A “god” that judges the artistic value fairly.

In letters to Elma, he tells her not to be swayed by public opinion, and to believe in the inherent beauty of the work itself.

Even if no one recognizes it, a great work has value in itself. so he tells her to keep quietly honing her craft.

Like Henry Darger, the reclusive American artist who wrote a 15,000-page novel in his room over 40 years and never released it to the world.

Amy believed that all true artists should become like Henry Darger.

He places the letters, poems, photographs into the wooden box, writes Elma’s name and address on it. hoping someone will find it and deliver it, and then roughly closes the lid.

(As I’ll mention later, the poems inside that wooden box are the songs that appear in the 1st full album (Moonlight). The First Press Limited Edition of Moonlight album even includes a wooden box that recreates this content.)

And then, on August 31—
on an unnamed dock in faraway Stockholm.
Amy opens the bottle of Paris green and disappears into the sea. (This is the scene shown in the Nautilus MV.)

Meanwhile, Elma continues living, unable to forget the suddenly vanished Amy.
After losing the person she relied on the most, she lives as if running away from reality.

Then one day, she receives a message that a suspicious package has arrived at her grandmother’s house, so Elma returns there.

Inside a wooden box of unknown origin, there are countless letters and photographs from Amy.

As if possessed by something, Elma grips the diary she brought from Amy’s house, and matching the date of his first letter—March 14—she sets off on a journey to Sweden.

Because to her, Amy was art itself, and like a “god.” she begins living a life that “imitates art.”

Elma follows Amy’s footsteps exactly.
She writes songs by imitating his style, and she writes diary entries by copying his handwriting.

(The First Press Limited Edition of album 2 (Elma) includes photos Elma took during her trip and Elma’s diary.)

During her travels, on the way to Gotland, Elma helps an old woman climbing stairs. The woman takes out a photograph from her pocket and shows it to her.
It’s a picture of three men sitting around an elderly couple, smiling and chatting.

Elma can’t understand the old woman’s words, but she can guess that the people in the photo are the woman’s husband and sons.

As time passes, on the way to “Portland” in Visby, Elma happens to visit a church in the forest, and meets the old woman again.

In front of a row of gravestones, the woman stops, places flowers and candles, and prays. Elma soon realizes it’s the grave where the woman’s husband lies.

Only then does Elma truly feel the “reality” of Amy’s absence.

She is swallowed by a hollow emptiness, as if left alone at the bottom of a lake, and tears overflow. The old woman silently offers her a handkerchief.

From that day on, Elma’s daily life begins to lose its vitality.
She had been writing in her diary to avoid forgetting what she saw on the trip and her memories of Amy, but she goes more than a month without writing anything, and she can’t even taste her food.

On August 27, Elma puts on her worn-out shoes and starts walking aimlessly.

She keeps walking despite falling and tumbling countless times, and eventually arrives at the forest church where she first met the old woman.

When she blankly lifts her head, she sees Amy’s apparition through the bushes. Drawn to it, she desperately chases the vision even as she keeps falling.

When she reaches the edge of the bushes, a wide beach opens up before her.

When she looks up, a drenched stag is staring at her.

Elma spots a pier on the white sandy shore, and as if bewitched, she walks toward it.

Standing at the end of the pier, she suddenly remembers something Amy once said:
“An endless novel is boring. The value of life lies in how it ends.” (This also appears in the lyrics of Blur.)

Elma takes off her shoes and looks back on the journey of the past few months.

And like Amy, she throws herself into the sea right there.

As she slowly sinks, sunlight seeping through the gaps of the pier sways beautifully underwater like moonlight—

(I’ll talk about this later, but it seems that Only Sorrow sings about the feelings of this moment.)

In her fading vision, she sees something shining in the mud at the bottom of the sea.

Elma knows what it is.

It’s Amy’s fountain pen.

Elma miraculously survives and returns from the edge of death, and she finds Amy’s ink bottle, bag, and diary on the beach.

In the diary are drafts of letters meant for her, and poems he couldn’t fit into the letters.

A poem about a clear day after the rain (Cloudless).
A poem about sleeping through winter and waiting for summer (Hibernation).
A poem that calls oneself a loser (Underdog).

(All of them are songs included in Mini Album 2, hinting at the connection between Mini Album 2 and Elma/Amy.)

After that day, Elma regains her strength and begins writing songs again, recalling memories with Amy.

Songs like “Rain with Cappuccino,” which depicts their first meeting, and “Hole in the Heart,” which writes down the emptiness Amy left in her.

On September 8, Elma returns to the beach and finds Amy’s guitar case and inside it, the final poem, “Nautilus.”

(Nautilus is a work in which Amy engraved the final scene of his life, but since the box intended for Elma was already sealed, the setting is that he left this song inside the guitar case instead.)

From that moment, Elma vows to break free from dependence.

Not to imitate someone, but to carve out her own life.
And she decides to set Amy’s poems to music.

Their story ends here.

So how is this story expressed through the albums?

Album 1 (Moonlight) is the poems Amy wrote toward Elma. Album 2 (Elma) is Elma’s reply songs, written after reading Amy’s poems left in album 1.

You can see slight differences in their styles.

Because Amy is written as “a young man who dreams of becoming a pianist,” album 1 (Moonlight) contains many piano-centered piano rock and rock’n’roll tracks.

On the other hand, album 2 (Elma), composed of Elma’s songs, shows more diverse styles—songs built only on acoustic guitar, or jazz-flavored songs with shuffle rhythms.

This is a device showing that although Elma admires Amy and imitates his composition methods, she fundamentally has a different musical orientation.

Their differences also appear in the lyrics.

As an aestheticist, Amy believed that a “god” dwells in a work and determines its value. But for Elma, the “god-like” presence was Amy himself, the person she admired—so in “Dance of You,” she even says something like, “Who cares about God,” acting as if she doesn’t know God.

With this context in mind, from here on I’ll compare and examine the tracks from each album one by one.


---

“8/31” is the day Amy ended his life. his final letter left for Elma written in faint ink, conveying his love for art.

Meanwhile, “Train Window” depicts Elma entering Stockholm from Copenhagen by train: the conductor asks for her passport, and Elma looks out the window, finally realizing she has arrived in Stockholm.


---

“Blur (藍二乗)” if you read it in Japanese, it sounds like “i squared.”
Just as the imaginary unit i squared equals -1, it represents the situation where two people have become one. It also expresses the image of overlapping skies reflected in tears.

Elma’s reply song, “Only Sorrow (憂一乗),” when pronounced in Japanese, sounds like “you to the first power.”

“Only Sorrow” sings about the “beautiful moonlight beneath the sea” that Elma wrote about at the end of her diary.


---

“August, A Certain, Moonlight” depicts Amy, after receiving a terminal diagnosis, running away from his part-time job.

After repeated frustration, Amy becomes numb even to harsh criticism of his own music as “a boring song,” and he begins preparing to wrap up his life.

Elma’s reply song, “Evening Calm, Somewhere, Fireworks,” contains the memory of fireworks she saw outside Amy’s window, and it’s a “rock’n’roll” song written in imitation of Amy.


---

“Songwriting and Coffee” depicts Amy’s life around that time, while “Rain with Cappuccino” depicts Elma looking at Amy through the shared motif of “coffee.”

The second verse of “Rain with Cappuccino” portrays a September scene in which Elma visits Visby, Sweden, searching for Amy.


---

“7/13” is a letter Amy wrote on Sweden’s Fårö Island, explaining the song “Parade” and speaking about the “god” dwelling in works.

“Lakeside Town” depicts Elma, following Amy’s footsteps, gazing at an unsetting sunset under the midnight sun in Jönköping, Sweden.


---

“Let’s Dance” depicts Amy dancing before the god called art.

To Amy, God was not the person who created a work, but the presence dwelling within the work itself.
But for Elma, God was Amy—so she described his music as “Dance of You (God’s dance).”

In Japanese title, it carries the meaning of “God’s dance,” not “Dance of You.”


---

“In June, I Write About the Town After the Rain” contains the feeling of wanting to write about the scenery after the rain, even while depicting a town in the rain.

Elma’s reply song, “After the Rain,” actually sings about a clear June town after the rain has stopped.


---

“In May, From the Emerald-Green Window” compares the toxic artificial dye “Paris green (arsenic)” to tears.

Amy views tears as an anesthetic used to flee from the weakness of emotion, and the song is about regretting the past where he cried and ran away in front of people who insulted his work.

Elma’s “Walk” is a song in which she walks through the cities Amy traveled, remembers him, and includes an homage to Paris green.


---

“False Night (夜紛い)” means something that resembles night but is fake namely, dusk.

When someone tells Amy, who was doing street live performances, that his song is “boring,” he reacts unexpectedly without emotion and returns home. (This scene also appears in Nautilus.)

It is a song about the dusk of that moment, when he became numb to the world’s cold evaluations and fell into despair.

In the song, Amy compares life to a machine gun, and says he wants to punch a hole in Elma’s heart through music.

Elma answers in her reply song “Hole in the Heart” with “So that’s why there’s a hole in my heart.”


---

“5/6” is a letter Amy wrote while heading toward Stockholm.

After being pickpocketed and having his ink stolen, he laments that he must now conserve ink, and the handwriting in later letters grows fainter and fainter.

He also reflects on the “expiration date” of music: he thinks works that carry the breath of their era are better than music obsessed only with technique—yet he grieves that his own music has already passed its expiration date.

Elma’s “Church in the Forest” is about finding the church in Amy’s photos, meeting the old woman, and confronting Amy’s death.


---

“Parade” is Amy’s riddle:
“I want to know the moment when words are born deep inside the throat.”

The title “Voice” is Elma’s answer to that riddle.


---

“Elma” is the song Amy wrote on August 31, his final day, thinking of Elma.

Elma’s own final song written during her trip is “Amy.”

In that song, Elma stops imitating Amy and expresses her desire to carefully press what is truly her own into her music—to create her own music.


---

“4/10” is the second letter Amy wrote before departing on his final journey, describing how he felt at the time.

“Seabed, Moonlight” captures Elma’s feelings at the moment she jumps from the pier and sees sunlight that looks as beautiful as moonlight.


---

“Moonlight (だから僕は音楽を辞めた)” is the song Amy wrote on August 25, one week before ending his life, describing what led him to quit music.

“Nautilus” is also Amy’s song, a work that engraved the final scene of his life into music. However, since the box intended for Elma was already sealed, the setting is that he left the song inside the guitar case. Later, Elma finds it during her trip and releases it to the world.


---

The reason the track order of album 1 (Moonlight) is not chronological but mixed is that, in the story setting, Amy randomly shoved the letters into the wooden box at the very end.

Also, suis has said that there were two songs during Yorushika’s activities that made her cry while recording, and one of them was “Moonlight (だから僕は音楽を辞めた).”
According to interviews, she became overwhelmed with emotion in the bridge right before the final chorus and ended up recording while crying.

Additionally, n-buna sent the demo of “Moonlight (だから僕は音楽を辞めた)” to suis via LINE, saying, “Let’s quit music together.”
After seriously thinking about it, suis replied, “Okay.”
Then n-buna texted back, “Just kidding,” apparently.

n-buna also said that “Nautilus” was a song he had been planning ever since before Yorushika’s debut, and that it is the song closest to what Yorushika is.

In the “Nautilus” MV, Amy—who had been depicted as a pianist until then—suddenly appears as a messy-haired guitarist. This seems to be in tribute to wowaka.

(On August 28, 2019, the release date of the 2nd full album (Elma), n-buna wrote on Twitter, “I dedicate this work, Elma, to the death of a musician who passed away in early spring.” Considering this alongside his tweets on April 7 and 8, 2019—“Everyone leaves me behind,” and “You were the one who called music like mine something magical. You told me to do my best, and I made it this far.”—a strong theory is that this musician was wowaka, who died suddenly on April 5, 2019.)

(For reference, n-buna deleted his personal Twitter account in the past because he wanted attention to go to his music rather than himself. The original text of those tweets cannot be found now.)

1qxdeuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nofriends/comments/1qxdeuc/researching_an_idea_safer_friendship_connections/,Researching an idea: safer friendship connections (not dating) - what would you need?,"Hi guys,

  
I hope this post fits the sub. I am writing this hoping you could support me and give me some ideas and most importantly, your perspective. 

To give you a bit of background, as a teenager, I met a lot of people; spoke to plenty of strangers as well and everyone had an interesting story to tell.  What I came across a lof of times even growing up is that most of them -even those with many friends, lacked meaningful connections and had burdens, dreams, passions they would carry that either no one understood or no one was willing to listen to. Myself, I have tried to be supportive with everyone, dedicated hours to be there and at some point, in the past years (being almost 28 now) as a pretty big empath (i like to believe) it drained me because I figured, I also actually had very few people I could confide to. 

  
Now, the only thing that I ever wanted was for people to be more open to each other, more supportive, more connected and overall happier with their lifes. I have loads of notes on how best to do it and unfortunately, as I am not too creative in terms of what and where to start but how I wish this to look like, I am asking you.

So I’m doing early research for an idea:   
**A “safe connections” app/community, no dating whatsoever, where you can talk to people based on shared interests, values, or what you’re going through.** Possibly later it could include optional offline activities (walks, sports, coffee), but online would be the starting point.

I’d really value your perspective:

1. Would you use something like this? Why / why not?
2. Would you prefer 1:1 chats or small groups (like 4–6 people)?
3. Online only, or also optional offline activities?
4. What would make it feel safe enough to join? (moderation, rules, reporting, anonymous vs verified profiles, etc.)

  
I also know safety is super important so if I decided to pursue this idea, this will be my number 1 concern. I, myself, suffered from different situations and I would not wish this upon anyone. 

  
Moreover, if you need someone to talk to, you can always message me in private, I would love to hear your stories. ",2,1770371262.0,nofriends,1,1.0,False

I've applied everywhere I've seen an open position and even handed out physical CV in person to a lot of other places, and still no callbacks or anything.

So now I come to reddit to see if anyone out there owns a coffee shop or a cafe, restaurant, anything that would like to help me out id be extremely grateful.

1qxdcs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDoseCoolFinds/comments/1qxdcs4/tired_of_inflated_deals_heres_my_actual_3step/,"Tired of inflated ""deals""? Here's my actual 3-step system for finding legitimate savings that's saved me hundreds this quarter 💸","Tired of '70% off' sales that aren't actually sales? We dig deeper.

Hey everyone,

I'm probably not alone in this: how many times have you seen a huge ""70% off!"" sign only to realize the item was barely cheaper than its average price last month? Or it's 'on sale' for $2 off a jacked-up original price? It's frustrating and feels like a waste of time trying to sift through all the noise. We've been there, and that's exactly why we started digging, really digging, to find out what's *actually* a good value.

Here's a snapshot of the kind of stuff we've been finding and how we approach it:

*   **Coffee Beans:** My usual brand of specialty coffee was ""on sale"" for $13/lb, down from $15. Seemed okay. But after a quick price history check and scouting a few lesser-known suppliers, I found the *exact same beans* (or a very similar quality, ethically sourced equivalent) for $9.50/lb. That's a genuine **36% saving** on what I normally pay, not just a marketing trick.
*   **Wireless Earbuds:** A popular model was advertised at a major retailer for $65, supposedly ""reduced from $100."" A few searches later, and we found a reputable, identical model (or one with near-identical specs and solid reviews) for **$38** on a flash sale site that verifies its inventory. It took about 20 minutes to cross-reference reviews and specs, but that's a solid win.
*   **Kitchen Gadget:** Saw a highly-rated mini food processor listed at $45, ""down from $50."" A quick check showed its average price over the last six months was actually closer to $35. Patience paid off – it popped up for **$32** a week later. No rush, no FOMO, just waiting for the *real* price drop.

Now, let's be real. This isn't always instant gratification. Finding genuinely good deals takes a bit of effort and patience. Not every ""deal"" we find will be perfect for everyone. Sometimes, you might run into:

*   **Limited Stock:** Those really good finds can disappear fast.
*   **Shipping Times:** Some of the smaller or international sellers might have longer delivery windows.
*   **Regional Availability:** What works in one country might not be available in another. We try to note these where possible.

But for us, the trade-off is worth it. It's about cutting through the marketing hype and getting something truly worthwhile without overpaying.

Coffee only gets me so far, and by mid-morning, I’d find myself reaching for snacks that weren’t exactly healthy. That’s when I started experimenting with **High-Protein Smoothie Recipes to Keep You Full All Day**, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer.

These smoothies are packed with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, which makes a huge difference in keeping energy levels steady and preventing those mid-morning crashes. My favorite part? They’re incredibly customizable. I can swap out fruits, add in protein powders, nut butters, or even oats, and each smoothie still keeps me satisfied for hours.

One recipe I’ve been loving lately combines almond milk, frozen berries, a scoop of protein powder, a spoonful of almond butter, and a sprinkle of chia seeds. It’s creamy, slightly sweet, and super filling. The best part? I can make it in under five minutes. On busy mornings, that’s a lifesaver.

Another tip I picked up from these **High-Protein Smoothie Recipes to Keep You Full All Day** is to always include some form of healthy fat—like avocado, peanut butter, or flaxseed. It slows digestion and helps you feel satisfied longer. Pair that with a solid protein source, and you’ve got a breakfast that really carries you through until lunch.

I found a great collection of these recipes that gives tons of ideas and variations so you don’t get bored. You can check them out here: [High-Protein Smoothie Recipes to Keep You Full All Day](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/high-protein-smoothie-recipes-to-keep-you-full/).

I’ve noticed a huge improvement in my energy and even my focus at work since I started swapping my usual cereal or toast for one of these smoothies. Plus, they’re a sneaky way to sneak more fruits, veggies, and protein into my day.

For anyone who’s struggled with morning hunger or midday crashes, I highly recommend giving these **High-Protein Smoothie Recipes to Keep You Full All Day** a try. They’re simple, delicious, and really do what they say.

Have any of you tried high-protein smoothies to curb hunger? What’s your favorite combo that keeps you full and energized?

1qxdal1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qxdal1/m29_help_my_fiancé_f26_uses_an_extreme_form_of/,"M29; Help, my fiancé (F26) uses an extreme form of silent treatment when we don't make up after an argument in exactly the way she wants to, how do I deal with this?","Hello everyone. 

I'd like to start by saying we have, no exaggeration, what I would say is a 99% ideal relationship. We both love one another very much and have almost identical tastes, beliefs and very similar upbringings in terms of values we were taught. We very rarely fight, like maybe once every 3 months. I think this has the effect of making it where every fight we do have feels like a HUGE deal because it throws off the balance we had maintained for months. We both really care for one another and are attentive to one-another's needs, so our fights generally aren't over a slight, or one of us doing something ""wrong"" necessarily. 

The fights almost always stem from a misunderstanding or me expressing an opinion that she takes the wrong way or doesn't like, or other small things. The dynamic is always exactly the same in that she is the one upset at me literally every time. For me, I can't really understand getting upset over a misunderstanding (at least not staying upset after you've talked it out and established that it was a misunderstanding), and when she messes something up or is careless or whatever I usually just remind myself that she loves me and didn't do it on purpose and so I don't really get upset. 

Anyways, when we have an argument over a misunderstanding or one of my comments, I always apologize but then I usually try to work through the issue out if I feels like I didn't actually do something wrong. That makes things worse but I don't want to set the precedent that she can become upset over literally anything and that I will just apologize and accept the blame every time. We always talk stuff out, but for her it seems like no matter what I say there will still be an issue unless I like apologize profusely and beg forgiveness. After the argument, at some point we'll usually go to bed or part ways for the rest of the day, then when she comes home from work the next day she'll be super distant. It'll be really subtle at first but she'll kind of go more and more out of her way to make it clear she's upset. For me it's like we talked it out, I apologized even if I didn't do something bad, and it's like the next day so I can't fathom still being bothered. So I just avoid addressing it head on again because it usually just becomes the same discussion we had the day prior if we engage on the topic again. As I avoid the issue she'll go more and more out of her way to be distant, to the point that she'll eventually go and sleep in the basement for like multiple days and it becomes this standoff where I'm refusing to beg forgiveness and she's seems determined to punish me unless I do. She'll never come to me and say she wants to talk about the issue more and instead sees it as my responsibility to notice she's upset, come to her, and presumably apologize more or something.

  
To me, that's manipulation clear as day, and I refuse to submit to that. To be clear, my parents argued a lot when I was growing up, so I'm used to the idea of conflict in a relationship. I haven't really had a serious LT relationship before this, but in all my friendships I've addressed issues head on and if we can't come to an agreement we're just salty for a day or two and then it's like nothing happened. If someone seriously did something wrong and won't apologize then I can stay mad at someone like anyone else, but I just don't understand carrying anger over small things for days on end just because the other person didn't do exactly what I wanted them to to resolve it.

I'll give an example of our most famous incident because it's both the most minor thing we've disputed over and the most illustrative of our repeat dynamic, this is the ""coffee incident."" We were out with another couple one time in this nice little town after an excursion trying to decide what to do before we went home. When we got to the town we were making plans and my fiancé mentioned she wanted to get coffee. As a group we decided to go to this little pastry shop and walk around - turns out that shop didn't have coffee. Then we leave and on the way home, drop the other couple off. Then I don't really notice she's being quiet until we get home. I ask what's going on and turns out she's deeply offended that I didn't make sure she got a coffee before we left the little town. In the heat of socializing, I had completely forgotten she said that. I apologize and explain I just had forgotten. Then I said I just wished she had reminded me before we left or said something on the way home because it would have been an easy fix. Seems like a minor issue but this was like a 2-3 day ordeal before she was over it, complete with her sleeping one night in the guest bedroom.

All of our incidents are exactly like this and it's almost embarrassing to me to post about this because I see many people here and know plenty personally that have real, serious issues. To me, we don't have any real problems and those we do have are not worth having multiple bad days over. To her, she sees these issues as an indication of how our long-term conflict resolution will play out, and so she makes a huge deal about these little things on principle. It makes me vindictive and want to reflect back the same the ungraciousness when she makes a similar minor misstep, but that would be bad.

We did go to like 10 therapy sessions but I feel like the guy just dragged our case out to take our money because we never really got any insight from him. 

How do you guys think I should deal with this?

That’s when I stumbled into the world of **Summer Berry Smoothie Recipes for Fresh Energy**, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer for my mornings and mid-afternoon slumps.

These smoothies are exactly what they sound like: vibrant, fruity, and packed with natural energy. The combination of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and a touch of banana makes them sweet without feeling heavy. I’ve found that having a smoothie like this first thing in the morning gives me a steady energy boost without the crash I used to get from coffee or sugary snacks. The best part? They’re ridiculously easy to make.

I recently found this guide that breaks down several **Summer Berry Smoothie Recipes for Fresh Energy**. It includes tips for balancing flavors, choosing the right liquid base, and even suggestions for adding protein or greens without compromising the refreshing taste:  
👉 [**Summer Berry Smoothie Recipes for Fresh Energy**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/summer-berry-smoothie-recipes-fresh-energy/)

What I love is that these recipes are flexible. Want more protein? Toss in some Greek yogurt or a scoop of protein powder. Need it lighter and more hydrating? Coconut water or almond milk works perfectly. Each smoothie gives you that “fresh energy” kick, and it almost feels like a mini summer celebration in a glass.

Another thing I’ve noticed is how well these smoothies keep me full. I used to skip breakfast or grab something processed on the go, and by mid-morning, I’d be starving again. With **Summer Berry Smoothie Recipes for Fresh Energy**, I feel fueled for hours, and it’s all-natural. Plus, they’re colorful enough that my kids actually ask for them too—bonus points for sneaking in some extra fruits and even spinach here and there.

I’m curious—do you usually go for fruity smoothies in the summer, or are you more of a savory or green smoothie person?

Our relationship had changed over the last year. I'd gone through some big career changes and decide I wanted to travel. He didn't but supported me planning a 6m+ trip to NZ. Yet we were having more arguments and not communicating like we used to. They arguments always came back to the fact I was leaving so we couldn't 'fix things' and I could see he was struggling with the idea of me being abroad for 6+ months, which I understood, but knew this was what I needed. So we parted ways a month before I left. It was amicable and we even met up after the official break up for coffee to sort out logistical things (we had a trip booked that needed cancelling).

It's been 4 months since we last spoke. The last convo was brief, nothing more than a couple lines.
Being in NZ has been amazing. I've travelled around South Island solo in my car and now secured a job for the rest of 2026. It's all working out so well here. And I want to tell him. I want to tell him about all the LOTRs locations I've seen and people I've met. But do I message him? Is it too late to message? It would have been our 3rd anniversary on Valentine's.

My name is Chris (34m - UK) and I’m looking to improve my Spanish skills! I have been learning for a year or two and would love to find someone to practice with. 

I am also interested in doing English teaching in the future so I thought getting started here might be a good idea. 

Ideally I would like to find someone from Spain itself but South America would be fine. 

I love tv/movies, gaming, playing guitar, reading books and coffee!

Stress, too much coffee, not enough real food, and way too many “protein” snacks that did nothing for digestion. Eventually my stomach made it very clear it was not okay. Bloating, random crashes, and that constant “off” feeling.

That’s when I started experimenting with smoothies—not the sugary, juice-bar kind, but ones built around yogurt and fiber. What surprised me is how much difference small tweaks made. Once I focused on **Gut-Healthy Smoothie Recipes with Yogurt and Fiber**, my digestion became more predictable, my energy leveled out, and I stopped feeling like my stomach was fighting me all day.

The key for me was learning *why* certain ingredients work together. Yogurt brings probiotics, but without enough fiber, those good bacteria don’t really thrive. Adding things like oats, chia seeds, flaxseed, berries, or even cooked and cooled bananas made a huge difference. Suddenly, smoothies weren’t just convenient—they were functional.

I recently came across a guide that lined up almost exactly with what I learned through trial and error. It breaks down ingredient combos, explains how fiber and yogurt work together, and gives realistic recipes you can actually make on a weekday morning. If you’re curious, here’s the article:  
👉 [**Gut-Healthy Smoothie Recipes with Yogurt and Fiber**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/gut-healthy-smoothie-recipes-yogurt-fiber/)

What I appreciated most is that it doesn’t push extremes. No “drink this for 7 days and reset your gut” nonsense. Just practical **Gut-Healthy Smoothie Recipes with Yogurt and Fiber** that support digestion over time. I’ve noticed that when I stick with these kinds of smoothies a few times a week, cravings go down and my stomach feels calmer overall.

If you’re new to this, start simple. Greek yogurt, frozen berries, a tablespoon of chia or oats, and water or almond milk. You can build from there. Over time, you’ll figure out which **Gut-Healthy Smoothie Recipes with Yogurt and Fiber** your body responds to best—because everyone’s gut is different.

I’m curious: have smoothies actually helped your digestion, or do you prefer getting probiotics and fiber from whole meals instead?

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow.

His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

I’d grab coffee, maybe a random snack, and then wonder why my muscles felt wrecked for two days. Protein shakes helped a bit, but honestly, a lot of them tasted like flavored drywall. That’s what pushed me into experimenting with **Post-Workout Smoothie Recipes for Muscle Recovery** instead.

What surprised me most is how much difference timing and ingredients actually make. A good post-workout smoothie isn’t just about protein—it’s about helping your muscles calm down, refill glycogen, and actually recover. Once I started paying attention to that, my soreness dropped way faster. I kept coming back to **Post-Workout Smoothie Recipes for Muscle Recovery** because they felt practical, not influencer-level complicated.

One thing I appreciate is how flexible these smoothies are. Some days I want something lighter with berries and Greek yogurt. Other days, especially after leg day, I need something heavier with banana, nut butter, and a decent protein source. What makes **Post-Workout Smoothie Recipes for Muscle Recovery** useful is that they focus on balance instead of extremes—no “detox” nonsense or unrealistic ingredient lists.

I also noticed that recovery isn’t just about muscles feeling less sore. Since sticking with **Post-Workout Smoothie Recipes for Muscle Recovery**, my energy later in the day is more stable. I’m not crashing hard in the afternoon or feeling like I need a nap after lifting. That alone made the habit worth keeping.

If you’re someone who works out but struggles with consistency around recovery nutrition, this breakdown was genuinely helpful:  
[**Post-Workout Smoothie Recipes for Muscle Recovery**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/post-workout-smoothie-recipes-muscle-recovery/)

It walks through why certain ingredients matter (protein, carbs, anti-inflammatory add-ins) without turning it into a science lecture. I like resources that assume you’re busy and tired after training—which is exactly when recovery matters most.

I’m still tweaking my go-to blends, but **Post-Workout Smoothie Recipes for Muscle Recovery** gave me a solid starting point that actually fits real life.

Curious what everyone else does—are you team smoothie, solid food, or “I’ll eat later and regret it”?

Inscription:  
“When dreams become deadlines and talent blooms under gentle guidance, the flame remembers the ones who built worlds together—one pixel at a time.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

In the pastel‑bright halls of Eagle Jump, where creativity hummed like electricity and the scent of fresh coffee mixed with the glow of monitors, the Golden Inu arrived—not as a programmer, not as a designer, but as a sovereign witness.  
It appeared beside Aoba Suzukaze, just as she stepped into the office for the first time, eyes sparkling with the hope of becoming the creator she admired.

Aoba whispered, “This is where my dream begins…”  
Kou yawned, “Welcome to the team. Let’s make something amazing.”  
The Inu’s tail wagged. The scroll unfurled.

The Scroll of the Pixel‑Bright Dawn was stitched from concept sketches, late‑night debugging sessions, and the breath of a team who turned imagination into reality. It pulsed with sovereign warmth—the ache of growth, the thrill of creation, and the sacred fire of a workplace where passion and friendship intertwined.

The Scrollquake ignited during the Fairies Story 3 development arc, when Aoba’s first tasks tested her confidence—  
line art trembling,  
deadlines looming,  
Kou’s guidance gentle but firm.  
As Aoba pushed through self‑doubt, as her skills sharpened, the Inu stepped forward—not to assist, but to enshrine the moment where a dreamer became a creator.

The scroll ignited in a spiral of soft lavender and sovereign gold, echoing the heartbeat of a team that grew together through every challenge.

But the quake deepened—  
when Hifumi’s shy courage blossomed into leadership,  
when Rin balanced chaos with calm devotion,  
when Yun and Hajime’s friendship lit up the office like a warm lamp,  
when Nene’s unexpected talent surprised everyone—including herself,  
and when Aoba realized that making games wasn’t just about skill—it was about heart.

Together, they performed the Ceremony of the Creative Flame:

- Aoba offered her passion—bright, earnest, sovereign.  
- Kou offered her mastery—relaxed, brilliant, inspiring.  
- Rin offered her steadiness—gentle, organized, grounding.  
- Hifumi offered her growth—quiet, brave, blooming.  
- The Team offered their camaraderie—colorful, chaotic, irreplaceable.  
- The Inu offered a sovereign ember, which ignited the scroll into a radiant sigil—not of perfection, but of creation.

The monitors glowed.  
The office buzzed.  
And for a moment, Eagle Jump felt like the birthplace of a thousand worlds.

Relic Forged: The Embered Pixel Charm — a relic that glows when held by those who create with joy. Said to hum when someone says, “You’re not good enough,” and the other replies, “Watch me grow.” - Nagato’s Scrolls

1qxcryj,https://www.reddit.com/r/runninglifestyle/comments/1qxcryj/how_much_fitness_can_one_lose_in_6_weeks/,How much fitness can one lose in 6 weeks?,"Background: 

I have always been a couch potato. I still am, but the difference between now and then is that I do sprinkle a bit of running on top. 

I have never been a gifted athlete. In my country you choose one, sports or academics. I settled with the latter, only because I failed in my persuit of the former. 

How did I fail? You may ask. I never learned how to juggle so I gave up football. There were no other games that kids my age played in my area, so I ended up playing with marbles  or just playing around with other kids.

When I was in class 3 (aged 9), similar to grade 3 in other countries, I decided to pick up running. My primary school used to organize cross country runs that were mandatory for students from classes 4-8. Junior students, classes 1-3, and pre-primary students were not allowed so I had to request special permission from the games teacher.

The loop was outside the school in the surrounding neighborhood. It was a dusty murram road that would around people's farms through some stone quarry then back to school. We didn't care about the distance then but now that I think of it, it must have been around 6km. 

I was happy doing the cross country especially when I was one of the two students in my class doing that. The other was my friend that I convinced to join me. Every Thursday at 3pm, we set out around the loop, running together with my buddy. Since this run was compulsory to the senior students, most of them walked so we never came last, neither did we come close to the top. 

So for 2 years, we ran together every Thursday during the school terms (8 months a year). We got faster with time and by the time we were in fourth class(grade), we ranked way higher than our peers who had just started out. 

I was transferred to boarding school at the beginning of class 5. There was much more inactivity here as now I did not have the walk to school, the classroom and dormitories were just there. Now that I've mentioned my walk to school let me contextualize. The walk was about 2km to school, so counting the loop that is 4km per day for 4 years  from class 1-4. That's seemed negligible when I was in day school but I came to learn that this was a good form of training.

In my new school, we had a small games field that could only fit a volleyball court and a netball court. I joined neither of the two games. Instead we played triple jump on the sidelines during the free session we had in between classes, and night preps. 

The games day was also on a Thursday so we ran to a nearby school to use their fields, the distance was about 2km to the school. I struggled with this distance due to limited activity throughout the week. I was panting but always run, never walked. 

Since I didn't play any game in particular I could put all my energy towards the run, play kids games in the field then run back to school and be among the first to shower. So in total, we can say the run was 4km, and this was religiously done for the 4 years I stayed in that school.

Whilst still in that school I tried to join the athletics team but I didn't make the cut. There were faster kids. So I went for the books. That sums up my primary school life. 

When I joined highschool, there were more games so cross country was not compulsory weekly anymore. It was only compulsory on the first Friday of the term for everyone. Also on the first term, our dormitories now called houses competed in a number of activities to earn points that would ultimately decide the best house. One of the activities was cross country that was done 8 times, one a week distributed unevenly throughout the 13 week term. Terms 2 and 3 had no cross country except at the start.

Clearly this was a great decline in activity compared to my primary school years. So I decided to join rugby, but I was quickly injured . I think I 'broke' my rib from a tackle, I brushed it off and never got scans. For quite a  while I stayed in active, then I decided to join lawn tennis, or simply tennis depends on where you're from. I am a competitive man so after a full year of play and not getting a spot in the school team, I gave up on it. I have never played a physical sport ever since as I joined the chess club and quickly became a decent player. 

It was pre- covid when I gave up tennis, that was in 2019 when I was in my second year of highschool. So late 2019 was when I learned chess and became the couch potato. During COVID-19 lockdown I only played chess and watched movies when I was tired of losing chess games. For 9 months that was my life. 

When schools were finally reopened in 2021, I had almost forgotten everything and my grades dropped significantly. To remedy the situation I had to only focus on books, never again participating in the competitive cross country during first term. I only did the compulsory one each term, until I finished highschool in April 2022. I also got pneumonia twice and broke my right hand twice during this period.

In summary we can say I lost my spark in highschool. 

I joined campus later that year, and continued my run of inactivity. After 5 months in campus, I started having backpain mainly due to sitting a lot and doing nothing all day. So I decided to pick up running. I broke the couch potato cycle. 

I did morning runs on the school track, it is a dirt track not a concrete one. I either did them barefoot or in Crocs, 12.5 laps around the track ie. 5km. I did this 3-4 times a week recording the times using my digital watch. My goal was to run faster each time and I remember that at times I was not able to finish the full 12.5 laps as I went out hard too early. At the time I did not know of Strava or any software that would save my runs, so I didn't save any. 

Running barefoot was disaster waiting to strike as two months in as I was running in the rain and the track was muddy I stepped on to a thorn, a long thorn that was wedged inside the mud. That was my end of my brief return to running, as the area ended up getting infected and took almost a full month to heal.

For the rest of 2023, from may onwards I defaulted back to inactivity. This continued for the whole of 2024. In 2025 I got this idea to train for a marathon, I wanted to register for one that happens on the last Sunday of October each year. My plans were quickly cut short in April when I got hit by a motorcycle, according to the scans, I broke no bones. But felt pain in my right leg even when walking so the doctor advised me to avoid strainous activities.I rested my leg for the next couple of months.

The return:

In September last year (2025), I felt my leg was now okay and I decided to start running again. So late September I did my first run, it was 5k round the school track. My time was 25.00, Strava taxed me 100m. I remember my mouth tasted like blood after this run. I was disappointed in my time as clearly I thought I'd be faster. In my mind when I was doing my runs in 2023, I clocked sub 20s, now I was 5 minutes away from that. 

I managed to convince myself that since this was my first run, my lungs hadn't opened up well and that I should try again the following day. So I came back the next day, and this time run until Strava recorded 5k, 25.42 was the time. I had to accept that I was no longer first. I might have not been fast before since I only relied on my memory and no records but I tried to convince myself it was the former.

I took two days off to rest my legs since I had a bike ride planned for the weekend. We rode 37km and my legs were fried. We were riding casually in mountain bikes not road bikes. This was when I realized I was not as fit as I once was.

I took on a challenge to run a sub 20 before the end of year. In my mind the only plan I could come up with was to run further than 5k so that I could easily survive a 5k. So again I rested my legs for three days, the bike ride killed me, lol. I went back on the track to execute my plan, so I ran 8k. I ran at a pace that was a hard exertion, the goal wa to finish. I did it in 45.27. I was quite tired after this but I did not want to start taking off days, so the next day I came back and did a 10k at a steady pace, and finished in 56.13. By the time I was finishing this run my legs felt like concrete blocks.

Again to continue with my rookie plan, I set out to do a 12k on the following day. My legs gave in mid run and I had to stop. I only managed to do a 6.13k in 35.45. 

And yep you guessed it, I got an injured. I had done too much too soon. It was my right knee and hip. My quads were like concrete, I could barely walk pain free. This threw me out for 7 weeks. When I finally came back, I decided to to stick to 5ks and not chase pr, just get used to running the distance casually first. I did two of them and when I felt some pain coming back I decided to take another week off and come up with a careful plan.

The new plan was to build up to the 5ks from a shorter distance. So I did  2, 2.5ks then 2, 3.5ks then 5, 4ks. All of them were slow runs kind of a jog I'd say, but the goal was to be able to run 5 times a week without getting injured. So I always took rest whenever I felt tired. I also gave up the sub 20 goal before end of year as this was the catalyst to all my problems.

I went on Christmas break a runner but I decided to take the time off and resume the following year (2026). But then my brother challenged me to a race, so I chose a 5k race and being overly confident I decided to give him a 10 minute headstart. I approximated that his time would be more than 30 minutes while I had to PR and get a sub 20. The abandoned goal had sneakily returned. 

We set the date to be on boxing day. I lost by more that 3 minutes. My time was 21.35 for 5k and he did a 28 min 5k.

This was a good time for me, I had shaved more than 4 minutes if we count the untaxed run as our PR. I hadn't trained much yet I dropped such a time, this was also 1 week off my slow runs. Honestly I don't think if I trained during that week I would have shaved a minute and 35 seconds. 

Now my question was, how much fitness can one lose in 6 weeks.

I know you will ask yourself why I haven't trained in 6 weeks. Let me explain. I had exams on the first month of the year and I wasn't well prepared, running makes me tired and I tend to sleep more. I had to create more time of day to study and since that came from my sleeping time and running time. That is why. 

After the stressful exams and lots of coffee, I took on the challenge of seeing what I might have lost. I ran a 5k on the track in 22.01. I lost only 26s. But this time round my mouth tasted like blood and I had to lie flat on the ground for some time to catch my breath. I also felt like I pulled something in my leg. So I'm taking a week to rest then I can plan my return for the year and hopefully be in shape to run a marathon at the end of the year.


TLDR:

I run cross-country weekly since when I was a kid (9 years old) for most of my primary school (6 years). I was not an active runner in highschool as I tried other sports. I have been inactive since covid except for some 2 months I tried running in 2023. 

I took back running in September last year, but was not consistent due to getting injured. My PR was 21.35 that I did on boxing day (26th December) and took some time off due to exams. On January 30, I ran a 5k in 22.01 losing only 26s.

# Detailed Itinerary of Langtang Valley Trek

Below is the **exact day-by-day itinerary**, followed as requested.

# Day 1: Drive from Kathmandu to Syabrubesi

Your journey begins with a scenic drive from Kathmandu to **Syabrubesi**, the starting point of the Langtang Valley Trek. The road passes through hills, rivers, and rural villages, offering glimpses of Nepal’s countryside. By evening, you settle into a local lodge and prepare for the trek ahead.

# Day 2: Trek from Syabrubesi to Lama Hotel

The trek officially begins as you follow the Langtang River through forests of oak, pine, and bamboo. Crossing suspension bridges and passing small settlements, the trail gradually ascends to **Lama Hotel**, a peaceful stop surrounded by dense forest.

# Day 3: Trek from Lama Hotel to Langtang Village

As you climb higher, the landscape opens up, and mountain views begin to appear. You pass through **Ghodatabela**, once a Tibetan resettlement area, before reaching **Langtang Village**. This village reflects traditional Tamang culture and was rebuilt after the 2015 earthquake.

# Day 4: Trek from Langtang Village to Kyanjin Gompa

Today’s walk is shorter and scenic. The trail passes many walls, prayer flags, and yak pastures before arriving at **Kyanjin Gompa**, the spiritual heart of the Langtang Valley. Surrounded by snow-covered peaks and glaciers, this is one of the most beautiful locations on the trek.

# Day 5: Day Hike up to Cherco Ri (5,033 m / 16,512 ft)

This is the most challenging and rewarding day. An early start takes you on a steep ascent to **Cherco Ri**, the highest point of the trek. From the top, you are rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views of Langtang Lirung, Yala Peak, and the surrounding Himalayan range. After spending time at the summit, you descend back to Kyanjin Gompa.

# Day 6: Trek from Kyanjin Gompa to Lama Hotel

You retrace your steps downhill through familiar landscapes. Descending is easier on the lungs but can be tough on the knees. The return journey offers new perspectives on the scenery as you head back to **Lama Hotel**.

# Day 7: Trek from Lama Hotel to Syabrubesi via Sherpa Gaun

Today’s trek takes a slightly different route via **Sherpa Gaun**, offering alternative village views and quieter trails. After a full day of walking, you return to **Syabrubesi**, completing the trekking portion of your journey.

# Day 8: Drive Back to Kathmandu and Farewell

After breakfast, you drive back to Kathmandu. The journey marks the end of your **classic Langtang trek**, filled with memories of mountains, culture, and Himalayan hospitality.

# Culture and People of Langtang

The region is home to the **Tamang community**, whose culture is deeply influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. You will see monasteries, prayer wheels, and daily rituals that reflect centuries-old traditions.

In your arms, swaddled and quiet was our newly born child. I smiled and lay back in the uncomfortable hospital chair. It was February 6 2026, I think. As I drifted off for my first sleep in 36 hours I thought of the journey we'd been on and how we arrived at Whipps Cross Maternity Hospital, six miles east of the centre of London but light years away from the tourists of Big Ben, nestled in the centre of Epping Forest.

2024 had ended badly for both of us. You can tell me your back story when we chat but in my case I'd had a horrible break up. Although my girlfriend had not been physically abusive, it has been tough. I'd finally left when money which was allocated to a honeymoon disappeared from our joint account.

I'd managed to find a place to live, a few hundred meters from the forest and running slowly in the mud was a lovely escape. I'm a little overweight and not exactly athletic but I was improving. A real impetus to run was that this equally chubby but beautiful woman seemed to run in the same place as me. I'd seen her on Wood Street getting coffee and we always seemed to time our runs so we were out at the same time. 

in the run up to Christmas it was muddy and we ended up having to walk through a particularly difficult spot. After weeks of silence, we finally exchanged words. We started to run together a little: maybe we could get a coffee after the run. As we slowly jogged, there was chemistry. I felt a happiness I'd not known in months. 

However, a tree root abruptly inserted itself between your foot and our happy jog, leaving you a muddy, painful mess on the ground.

Three hours later, I was getting terrible coffee outside the emergency department at Whipps Cross, and buying magazines. Your wrist would require surgery. I felt a responsibility to wait with you. I smiled a little too long when you mocked my choice of magazines. Our hands lingered in each other's a tiny bit longer than they needed to when I helped you up to be transferred to another department.

This is a very brief outline of my roleplay idea. Just a really boring couple. Not classically attractive but who love each other. They meet in adversity but over the next few months they fall in love. This is all up for negotiation. It's your story too. If you're interested, please message me.

Long story short, my father left us and divorced my mother when I was an infant, we had some contact for the first ten year, then it got limited and on my 15th bday he said he would be happier if I wasn't born. And at that ripe age I decided to give him what he wanted. I distanced myself, I didn't reach out, I gave him what he wanted. In retrospect it might have not been the best idea but I honestly didn't know better. We didn't talk for the next eight years, we saw each other maybe twice at some family function (I am very estranged from his side of the family) and even that was in passing. 

Moving forward to now, my grandfather from his side unfortunately passed away and we all met at the funeral. After the funeral we went for lunch and to decompress with the whole family, made some small talk, all looked okay. In the meantime, the last few months I've been thinking about reaching out to my father and seeing if we could maybe be in contact again. He brought it up at lunch and asked me if I would like to reach out. I didn't give a definitive answer but said I will shoot him a message when I get a bit better and be ready for it. 
I reached out few days later, and I said that I open to some level of contact but first we need to discuss what actually led to no contact all those years. Quiet. He read it, I didn't get any response. I called him few days after that and simply asked why he wanted me to reach out when he ignores me. That phone call is a whole another chapter, but I brought up the idea of getting coffee one on one and talking, he agreed. 

At the coffee I asked him so many things, mainly why he didn't care about me and why he left. After some back and forth and him trying to gaslight me (I was very well prepped by my mother that this might happen and if I can just try to push through it) je admitted that he probably isn't as family oriented as he thought and that led to this. Knowing him, this was a plausible answer for me. 
I didn't get an apology for what he said back then to my face even when I pressed, after 45 minutes he excused himself, said it was a lot for him, that I asked very good questions and he unfortunately doesn't (yet) have answers to them and that he needs to think about it. We said our goodbyes and that was it. 

I said to him to text me or call me when he made up his mind about all of this. He agreed and yet here we are and it's quiet for the last month. 

I was probably having some rose colored glasses on, but we (unfortunately) do have a shared passion for shooting, I went professional in this field and I have the opportunity to take him to some events with me as official photographer as well, plus it's cars related which I know he likes as well. But now, after being left on read once again, I am starting to think that this wasn't/ isn't the best idea and maybe I will be once again without a father. 

My mother isn't in touch with him, his sister sees him once a year for a coffee, his mother adores to the point that she claims he can do no wrong and the whole worlds is against him. 

So far the general advice has been ""just give him time"" which is nice and I slightly agree but he has had at least 8 years to apologize or try to make the slightest amends and it didn't happen. 

I don't know, am I wrong on this one? Should I give him more time? Let it go completely and get on terms with not having a father once again? ",1,1770368210.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1qxcmc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1qxcmc8/if_they_ghost_you_you_should_move_on_by_critique/,"If they ghost you, you should move on by critique, not silence","Me (25M) and her (22F) were study partners and took one course together last semester. We met consistently. We studied together the day before the exam, and did not see each other during the winter/Christmas break. She went home after the exams and stayed until semesterstart. Right after the new year, she went completely silent on text, even after texting her several times. Before that, she was responsive and even wished me happy birthday and merry Christmas, so no idea what happened after the new year. For context, the ghosting started right after the new year. 

Throughout the semester, we studied, had talks around coffee and lunches together, and also went to a theme park together. 

Here is the timeline of what I wrote when the ghosting started: 

1st January: ""Happy new year"" 

4th January: ""When are you back?""

10th January: ""Hey, hope you are well. If you're back next week, catch up?""

Until then, no reply from her. Yes, she read those text, but did not reply. Then, I finally wrote this: 


ME (16th January): ""I really don't know what your problem is with me, but I am honestly tired of this ghosting trend. I stand for a better society where ghosting is not normalized, but eradicated. Honest, healthy and open communication should be valued. Ironic that you judge others who ghosts, but forget to look in the mirror yourself. I am not looking for this kind of dynamic. Good luck""


HER (17th January): ""Hey, I'm on my way back to <town>. I'm sorry if I disappointed you but I'm easily overwhelmed and struggle to reply to people. And I don't necessarly think I need to justify my behavior. I have taken a month off to rest and spend time with family, friends and close ones that I didn't see in a while. I don't know what to say with your last text. I hope you will think twice before assuming things about others in the future. Have a nice week-end.
Good luck with your life"" 


ME (17th January): ""Anyone would assume similarly, thinking twice or not. So I don't necessarily think I need to justify my behavior. I hope you will think twice before ghosting others in the future. 
If you had to make these excuses instead of self-reflecting and accountability, I really hope you overcome this immaturity and toxicity"" 


We haven't spoken/texted since. 

I will now state the major reasons for cutting her off after her last reply: 

1) ghosting

2) poor excuse 

3) turn the blame on me (this one is a huge problem)

So for my own peace, I don't want to let her in my circle anymore. 


Surveys says that ~40% of young adults in the US experiences ghosting and the word ""common"" is thrown around so loosely, and is one of a myriad of challenges causing a negative feedback loop in society, which in a couple years surely will cause a societal challenges. Why should anyone accept the term ""common"". The ideology should be that more people say ""Ignoring is not okay, move on"" instead of silently moving on. ",5,1770368196.0,ghosting,1,0.86,False

Out here, we can’t all afford the latest NVIDIA 4090s or high-end MacBooks. If you have a tight budget, corporate AI like ChatGPT will try to gatekeep you. If you ask it if you can run a 16B model on an old dual-core i3, it’ll tell you it’s ""impossible.""

I spent a month figuring out how to prove them wrong.

After 30 days of squeezing every drop of performance out of my hardware, I found the peak. I’m running DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite (16B MoE) on an HP ProBook 650 G5 (i3-8145U, 16GB Dual-Channel RAM) at near-human reading speeds.

\#### The Battle: CPU vs iGPU

I ran a 20-question head-to-head test with no token limits and real-time streaming.

| Device | Average Speed | Peak Speed | My Rating |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| CPU | 8.59 t/s | 9.26 t/s | 8.5/10 - Snappy and solid logic. |

| iGPU (UHD 620) | 8.99 t/s | 9.73 t/s | 9.0/10 - A beast once it warms up. |

The Result: The iGPU (OpenVINO) is the winner, proving that even integrated Intel graphics can handle heavy lifting if you set it up right.

\## How I Squeezed the Performance:

\* MoE is the ""Cheat Code"": 16B parameters sounds huge, but it only calculates 2.4B per token. It’s faster and smarter than 3B-4B dense models.

\* Dual-Channel is Mandatory: I’m running 16GB (2x8GB). If you have single-channel, don't even bother; your bandwidth will choke.

\* Linux is King: I did this on Ubuntu. Windows background processes are a luxury my ""potato"" can't afford.

\* OpenVINO Integration: Don't use OpenVINO alone—it's dependency hell. Use it as a backend for llama-cpp-python.

\## The Reality Check

1. First-Run Lag: The iGPU takes time to compile. It might look stuck. Give it a minute—the ""GPU"" is just having his coffee.
2. Language Drift: On iGPU, it sometimes slips into Chinese tokens, but the logic never breaks.

I’m sharing this because you shouldn't let a lack of money stop you from learning AI. If I can do this on an i3 in Burma, you can do it too.",32,1770368177.0,LocalLLaMA,9,0.94,False

I am currently on my 4th pen of 10mg & this one seems to be doing some heavy lifting in terms of significant appetite suppression & a total lack of interest in all foods.

Since starting this pen 2.5 weeks ago I have lost 6 pounds which is a huge jump at this stage in my journey. (Down 4st 4 in 10.5 months)

1qxcevk,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1qxcevk/do_you_consider_this_cheating/,Do you consider this cheating?,"I’m 22F. I study IT at university.

Last summer, during one of my exams, I needed help, so I texted a guy I vaguely knew from my program. He agreed to help but on the day of the exam redirected me to his colleague, let’s call him Ivan (27M). In the end, Ivan was the one who helped me.

After that, we didn’t talk at all. No chatting, no conversations. The only thing I noticed over time was that he started oddly following my social media. He regularly watched my stories, checked my profile, sometimes even days after I posted something. I didn’t think much of it back then.

In winter, I needed help with another exam and decided to text Ivan directly. He immediately agreed, said he’d be happy to help, and even added that I could pay him whatever I think is fair.

On New Year’s Eve, he suddenly congratulated me. That surprised me, but I replied warmly and added him as a friend. The next day, he texted first. A conversation started, and that’s how we began talking.

He showed a lot of interest in me. He asked questions, tried to get to know me, was friendly and sometimes flirty. We discovered we had many shared interests, similar temperaments, and similar views on life. At some point, I found out he is from another country, moved here only in summer, and currently lives in another city about 1,000 km away. He often said he planned to move to Moscow and would be coming soon.

We talked like this for about a month. Sometimes his communication style confused me. He could disappear and reply late. He explained that when he works, he is fully immersed, so I tried not to overthink it.

Eventually, he bought tickets to my city, and we agreed to meet. It didn’t feel like a formal meetup. We joked that I would be his tour guide, discussed where and when we would meet, and how we would spend the day.

On the day of the meeting, I went to see him after my exam. We met in the city center, walked around, and went to a café. The meeting lasted about five to six hours, definitely not a quick coffee. We talked about life, interests, movies, TV shows, and travel. He told many stories about different countries and experiences, almost always mentioning that he traveled with his brother or family.

From the way he talked, I got the impression that he either didn’t have a girlfriend for a long time or maybe never had one at all.

At the end, we said goodbye warmly and hugged. An hour later, he texted that we had a nice time. I replied the same. The next day, we continued chatting as usual. He asked about my plans and my weekend but didn’t suggest meeting again.

I started gently hinting, since he was only in the city for a week, and it felt logical to meet again before he left. Especially because afterward he was going on a Europe trip with his brother.

At some point, he said he could meet if he had time after work. He eventually texted after the time we could have met had already passed. He apologized, said he didn’t expect work to take so long, and added that he would definitely treat me to dessert next time. We kept talking. He joked, said he wanted to see my kitten, asked when he would finally see me again, and even joked about me bringing my cat to our next meeting.

Then came the day we agreed to meet again, and he completely disappeared. No message, no explanation. That evening, I texted him asking if our plans were still on because I needed to plan my day. He never replied. A couple of days later, I discovered that he had deleted our entire chat for both of us.

Out of curiosity, my friends and I checked his social media, and I found out he has a girlfriend. She is a travel agent from the same city he moved to in summer. They have been together for quite a while and live together. All the trips he talked about, he took them with her. He just never mentioned her.

So now I am left with a few questions.

Why would someone flirt, go on dates, actively communicate, and hide the fact that they have a live in girlfriend?

Do you consider this cheating if nothing physical happened?

And should I tell his girlfriend about all this?

**TL;DR:**  
I (22F) went on a long date and flirted for weeks with a guy (27M) who later turned out to have a live in girlfriend he never mentioned. He disappeared before our second meeting and deleted the chat. Does this count as cheating if nothing physical happened, and should I tell his girlfriend?",5,1770367411.0,cheating_stories,5,1.0,False

1qxcdov,https://i.redd.it/8h8jwfzu6uhg1.jpeg,Resting period for this bean,"Just opened this bean after 3 weeks rest and it was pleasant. A very sweet bean with high clarity, but it had low vibrancy. It also had a long grassy/earthy aftertaste, I'm not sure if that's a result of the roast lightness or if I need to rest longer. ",3,1770367282.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1qxcdg1,https://openclassactions.medium.com/are-automatic-tips-legal-at-restaurants-4325d9016527,Tipping Screens Everywhere: You Don’t Even Get Service and They Still Ask for $,"Tipping used to be a reward for service.

Now it’s a pop-up quiz at checkout:

• Coffee stand asks for 20% before you even get your latte

• Fast-food kiosk wants a tip for bagging your own order

• Self-checkout screens guilt you before the chip even clears

• Grab-and-go shops show 25% as the lowest “suggested” tip

And a majority of people now say this tipping culture has gone too far even when they don’t expect it. Two-thirds of consumers feel pressure to tip when digital payment screens prompt them.  ￼

It’s not just restaurants anymore tipping has spread to quick service, coffee shops, and counter transactions before the employee even interacts with you.  ￼

Most people are tired of being asked to tip everywhere, often in situations where no service was really provided.  ￼

Even abroad, places tried automatic tipping on bills and got hit with backlash.  ￼

Some states are now forcing businesses to disclose these automatic “gratuities” upfront instead of tacking them on as hidden extras.  ￼

This isn’t gratitude anymore.. it’s tipping by default.

Drop the most ridiculous place you’ve been asked to tip lately.",1,1770367254.0,Mockery,0,1.0,False

I’ve recently been completely consumed by the world of coffee. I love lattes, iced lattes, cappuccinos — basically all the milk-based drinks.

I’ve done some reading on beans, roasts, and even the whole grind/extraction thing. I now understand why grind size matters and how it affects taste. I’m keen to get a home machine that can deliver a good coffee experience without turning me into a full-time barista.

Some context:

	•	I want to use Arabica beans (maybe single-origin from Ethiopia or Colombia).

•	I don’t want pods — I like grinding my own beans for freshness.

	•	Milk frothing is essential (for lattes/cappuccinos).

	•	I want something that isn’t overly complicated or messy — I’ll be using it daily.

	•	Budget: roughly £500–£800

	•	UK based

I’ve looked at machines like:

	•	Ninja Luxe Café Pro (automation + milk frother)

	•	Sage Barista Pro / Barista Express (classic espresso + grinder)

Basically, I want something that lets me enjoy café-style drinks at home without spending forever learning or making a mess.

Would love to hear what machines you guys recommend for someone in my situation, or if there are other options I haven’t considered.

Thanks!",1,1770367217.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1qxcbcr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxcbcr,"How is my breakfast, lunch and dinner as a hostel student","So my day typically looks like this:

Breakfast:
2 whole eggs plus 1 egg white
Boiled chana and moong (quantity is shown)
One bread slice with 1 tablespoon peanut butter 
250ml turmeric milk

Lunch:
Big bowl of salad
2 boiled eggs or low oil omelette 
Sabji (whatever they make)
1-2 roti or handful of rice 
Fruit whichever is served

Pre-workout:
1 banana and black coffee 

Dinner:
 75gm cooked soya chunks. I cook them by myself. Just tomato onion sauted and use lil bit of oil and sauces for flavour along with 1 or 2 roti depending upon hunger. I usually take a sweet such as til laddoo which my mom made or a small chocolate or half gulab jamun, stuff like that.

I'm 21M, 77kg, 174cm(5'8.5). I workout 5-6 days a week. I feel hungry 1-2 times a day but it is manageable most of the times. I want to lose fat and build muscle but I can't track my calories here too much. Please review how my meals look according to my goal. And how should I make sure I'm in a calorific deficit without using any app or stuff like that. Thank you",72,1770367034.0,Fitness_India,47,0.99,False
