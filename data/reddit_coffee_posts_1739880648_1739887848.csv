He had his gallbladder removed, 2 stents placed. Tumor had grown, he started getting fever and other bad symptoms and had a 3rd stent placed, connecting the liver and stomach. Last week, he vomited coffee grounds vomit and we went to the closest good working hospital ER, they stopped the vomiting, drained out the fluid from his stomach and said that it isnt curable anymore. He cant get out of bed without help, cant do almost anything. We got him back home today and he's still alive mostly sleeping, you can barely hear his voice, but he's still here.

I‚Äôve been on 300mg XR for about 3 years now,"I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for the past 6 years but have changed my dosage a few times to see what works best. For a while 300mg did the trick for me, and helped negate the side effects of my ocd medication (tryciclic antidepressant) but recently I‚Äôve been so tired during the day. You know it‚Äôs bad when coffee doesn‚Äôt even wake me up anymore, it‚Äôs 9am and I had a coffee an hour ago and I‚Äôm still tired so by 12pm I usually have an energy drink. I thought maybe decreasing my ocd medication would help with how tired I am, a month ago I went down in dosage a bit but it didn‚Äôt do anything for me energy wise. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist  on Monday and I‚Äôm thinking of asking her if she thinks it would be worth it to split up my dosage instead of 300mg in the AM to 100mg IR 3x a day, I tried this a few years ago but I don‚Äôt remember it really changing anything but then again it‚Äôs been a while. I also used to take for a bit adderall but it was more of a quick fix from my psychiatrist and I don‚Äôt think I want to go down that path again and be dependent. I‚Äôm a very active person, I workout 6x a week but usually workout in the evening as I usually have more energy. In the morning I just am too tired to do it. I‚Äôve also had issues recently with my appetite/cravings being out of control and in the past year gained like 10 pounds (I‚Äôm a petite woman) I know Wellbutrin is supposed to help with appetite control so I wonder if switching to 100mg IR would help? I‚Äôve also taken 450mg before but I also don‚Äôt want to go down that path unless I really have to because I worry about the seizure risk.

Okay, before you say, ""Whoa, that's way too intense!"" hear me out. At first, it sounds a bit like turning your life into one of those military operation movies, right? But **it's actually more like setting the perfect playlist for your week**. And who doesn't love a good playlist?!

Here's how it works and why it might just become your new fave life hack:

- **Focus like a laser beam**: Imagine knowing exactly what you're supposed to be doing at any given moment. No more time wasted staring at your phone trying to remember what you need to do next. Boom, productivity unlocked!

- **Find those sneaky pockets of freedom**: Ever find yourself with a sudden free half-hour and no idea how to spend it? Planning in 15-minute slots means you'll finally notice those little windows of joy‚Äîhello, quick nap or spontaneous coffee catch-up!

- **Prevent the Monday morning dread**: Start your week feeling like a boss. Knowing your plan is already set means you wake up Monday ready to tackle the world instead of groaning into your pillow.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""15 minutes? What magical universe do you live in where stuff only takes 15 minutes?!"" üòÖ But check this out:

- Use those increments as **building blocks**: Got an hour-long task? That's just four 15-minute blocks! Easy peasy, right? It's like Tetris, but for your to-do list.

- **Start with the fun stuff**: Add something you love to do in those slots‚Äîreading, doodling, or maybe just staring at the ceiling. Reward yourself and keep morale high. üéâ

- **Adapt and conquer**: Life‚Äôs not static, and neither is your schedule. If the plan shifts, tweak those increments like a pro and keep going. Flexibility is your friend.

And here's the playful twist: **It makes boring tasks a bit of a game.** You get that rush from beating a challenge when you finish a task right on time. Anyone else ever feel like they deserve a gold star for just adulting? Just me? üòè

So, give it a shot, dance through your week to your own rhythm, and see how it feels. If nothing else, you'll have a great story about that week you tried living like a Tim Ferriss-esque scheduling guru. Who knows, you might even discover your new favorite way to blitz through tasks while still finding time for ice cream breaks.

What do you think‚Äîready to give your planning a tiny time-tweak? Or is this one step too close to feeling like you're scheduling your life in Morse code? üôà",0,1739886305.0,MaximizeMe,0,0.5,False

I had my first real day of work yesterday and don't really have anyone to share it with. Child is away at college and understandably busy with school work and fraternity obligations, and the cat is just mad I missed our cuddle time appointments. 

It started as a comedy of errors where I didn't get my whole uniform delivered as I assumed, so I was wearing the wrong color bottoms with my top, which I promptly spilled coffee on after hitting an unfamiliar pothole because I had to go the ""back way"" out of my neighborhood, because the main road was blocked by a truck delivering materials to the house at the end of the street (sure they coned off and left a ""lane"" open - large enough for a bicycle or motorcycle). I was about 5 minutes late. No one noticed or cared about my uniform or my tardiness and I didn't apologize, though I really wanted to. I kept wanting to ask the girl training me to slow down, but I know having been a trainer, sometimes that's difficult. We got along really well otherwise. I just have a lot of studying to do between now and my next day of work. I'm still excited for the opportunity, but I am exhausted! I'm sure it will normalize with time, but I barely had the energy to do my dishes and start my laundry before I dragged myself to bed.

1isczh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1isczh9/trip_report_puerto_rico/,Trip report: Puerto Rico,"I just spent a week in Puerto Rico for my honeymoon. I‚Äôve also spent about four months in total working here when I used to do disaster relief work. I think I share a sentiment with a lot of people including actual Puerto Ricans when I say I both love this place and am constantly infuriated whenever I‚Äôm here lol. 

The through line of being here is that for all the amazing natural wonder and lovely people, there is some arbitrary and unspoken rule or circumstance that justifies things being juuuuust a little shitty or annoying or lazy. 

Your phone plan covers all of the US, Canada, and Mexico? Not Puerto Rico, that requires an international plan. 

Your car insurance covers any vehicle you rent? Nope, fuck you you need to get the extra comprehensive (yes I know this is a common rental scam, yes my insurance company told me I didn‚Äôt need it to rent a car, yes they refused to let me take my rental if I didn‚Äôt get their coverage)

That really pretty hotel you got in Old San Juan with the rooftop pool? Closes at 8pm. Why? No reason it just does. 

Anyone who‚Äôs spent any time in PR can tell you some wild adventures what it‚Äôs like driving here. Shitty roads, crazy drivers, and that vehicle with crazy ambulance lights rushing up behind you on the highway you pulled over for? Party bus. 

Yes you do need to ask the waitress three times to bring you some water. 

Everything is fried. That fish sandwich you got? Like an ounce of fish versus five times as much crusty batter. Oh yea and you do need to remind the waiter for that tartar sauce twice. 

You need to pay for your parking garage ticket. There‚Äôs machines that only take cash but you can go to the guy at the counter behind the glass to use your card (20%) fee. What? No you can‚Äôt give him the cash, only card. Use cash at the machine. 

The walking path to that part of the fort in old San Juan is closed. 

The cool old graveyard closes at 3:00pm? The grounds keeper left early that day and locks you and your wife in there at 2:30. 

Yes it takes 15 minutes for ONE person to buy tickets to the vieques ferry because the person is required to enter in SUPER IMPORTANT PERSONAL INFORMATION through the shittiest speaker through glass. 

3 hour wait for the next ferry? No there‚Äôs no bar, or shop, or even street vendors within 5 miles. Why? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That taxi driver who you gotta pay $20 to but all you have is 100? No he can‚Äôt break your 100. There‚Äôs NO possible way at the END of the day he has FOUR 20‚Äôs after he‚Äôs been taking cash only all day. 

No there‚Äôs no atm

No that store is closed today

Yes that bag of chips was 5 dollars

Call for a taxi to get you. Get texted the number for his son. Get called by the other guy who leaves you on the line not acknowledging you. Son says confirmed. The other guy picks you up. 

Ask for the taxi to get you at 12:30. He gets there at 12:05 and says he‚Äôs waiting on you. 

Ask for the taxi to get you at 4. Says he can get there at 4:10. Doesn‚Äôt get there until 4:58. 

Try to eat authentic, all fried. 

Try to get some seafood. All from a can. Disgusting 

The best food you have the entire trip is an Italian food place. 

Pretty sure that pothole just knocked something loose in the rental car. 

Yes every motion activated light in the bathroom stays on the minimum programmable time. Every one. 

You know how in the US a place will have several trash cans around the walls or by the doors? No there‚Äôs only one at the far end of the joint. 

That sign out front that says ‚ÄúMeads, Seafood, Steaks‚Äù? ‚ÄúYeah it should say ‚Äòmeats‚Äô. They spelled it wrong. Welcome to Puerto Rico.‚Äù  ‚Ä¶and you didn‚Äôt change it? Welcome to Puerto Rico. 

No we don‚Äôt rent jet skis anymore. They all sank.  No we don‚Äôt rent paddle boards anymore, we lost the little fins that go on the bottom for you to go straight. 

The nighttime kayak tour guide who takes you out to see the bio-luminescent bay? Hilariously crazy man who I don‚Äôt think said a single correct or truthful thing the entire time. Also lost one of the kayakers from our group in the chaos (we think they went in the group with another company). 

Street food in old San Juan? Just like a slice of pizza or hotdog to take and walk around with? All closed up and gone by like 5 or 6pm. Sit down only after that. 

No the hotel doesn‚Äôt have free coffee. 

I love it here. It‚Äôs beautiful. I never felt sketched out, Puerto Rico is a very safe place to travel to. The people aren‚Äôt mean or scary or threatening. They‚Äôre just lazy and hilariously apathetic and honestly I think they‚Äôre the first to admit that. ‚ÄúWelcome to Puerto Rico‚Äù gets used a lot when the explaining of why that particular thing doesn‚Äôt work.

I've got some life hacks that might just change the game for you‚Äîthink of them as your personal cheatsheet to adulting smoothly. üòâ

**1. ** **The Two-Minute Rule.** If something takes less than two minutes to do, just do it NOW. Those tiny tasks huddle like dust bunnies in the corner of your mind and, before you know it, you're in a lint avalanche.

**2. ** **Batch It Like a Boss.** Cooking? Emails? Errands? Group similar tasks into one chunk of time, and knock them out like dominoes. Less task-switching equals more time for that Netflix binge. üôå

**3. ** **Alarm Your Water Intake.** Staying hydrated can feel like owning a pet rock‚Äîoften forgotten but essential! Set hourly alarms to remind you to hydrate‚Äîthank me when your skin and energy levels glow brighter than your future.

**4. ** **Morning Playlist Power-Up.** Ever notice how your favorite jams can flip your mood like a switch? Curate a morning playlist that could beat coffee as the best wake-up call‚Äîdance, sing, and start the day like you mean it!

**5. ** **Snooze Your Socials.** We love a good scroll, but social media can be a black hole for time. Give yourself **scheduled** social media breaks, and reclaim your clock. You might even discover an extra hour hiding somewhere!

**6. ** **Phone a Friend (Literally).** Got a big decision to make? Talk it out loud. Even if your dog stares at you like you're from Mars, verbalizing can lead to epiphanies‚Äîor an amused pet. üê∂

**7. ** **Meal Prep Magic.** It might seem like a weekend-losing endeavor, but prepping meals ahead saves you from that mid-week meltdown of ""What‚Äôs for dinner?"" Plus, it‚Äôs an excuse to show off your culinary wizardry. üë©‚Äçüç≥

**8. ** **The Declutter Dash.** Every night, take 5 minutes for a quick tidy-up. Yes, *just 5 minutes.* You'll wake up to a tidier space without feeling like you live in a perpetual rummage sale.

**9. ** **Elevator Pitch Your Thoughts.** Got an idea brewing? Whether it‚Äôs brilliant or bonkers, jot it down! Your mind's like a sponge; don't let it drip on creativity‚Äôs best notes. üìì

**10. ** **Gratitude, Duh!** Start the day with three things you're thankful for. It‚Äôs like caffeine for the soul, but without the jitters. Life's little reminders can make a big difference.

**Background**

My (33M) first marathon was Tel Aviv in 2023, where I ran 2:51. Followed that up with Valencia later that year, bringing the time down to 2:44. Funny enough, I actually started marathon training just to build strength and endurance for shorter races. But something about the training style clicked - I preferred the higher mileage and steadier pace work over the intense 200-400m intervals needed for 5-10K training. It just suited me better.

Being an Austin local worked in my favor - most of my long runs over the past 8 months covered the hilliest parts of the marathon course.

**Training**

My path to this marathon started with summer 2024 which was all about speed - chasing a sub-16 5K (got close with 16:15) with lots of track work at lower mileage (50-60mi/80-95km). But honestly, I was happier when I switched to marathon training in September.

I started with some ambitious training, hitting 70-77 miles (115-125km) per week with CIM in mind and a goal of 2:34. Then came a classic case of doing too much - in late October, I stacked a tough track session (25x400m at 5:15/mi (3:15/km) pace) with a 20-mile (32km) long run (6:24/mi, 3:59/km pace) the next day. Result? A nice gluteus tendon injury from overuse. Had to reset: took a week off, followed by three weeks of easy running at 40mi (64km) per week. Somehow thought it would be a good idea to do two of those weeks in Flagstaff at altitude - because recovery wasn't hard enough already.

Coming back from injury in early December, I signed up for Austin Marathon (Feb 16) and Houston Half-Marathon (Jan 19) figuring the half would be a good fitness check. My first solid speed session of the post-injury build was 25x400m repeats with 30-second recovery at 6:10/mi (3:50/km) pace and it felt surprisingly good and showed I hadn't lost everything during the downtime.

The build continued with some key workouts that shaped my fitness:  
\- 2x6km fartlek alternating 6:26/5:53 mi (4:00/3:40 km) pace  
\- 14x1km at 6:15/mi (3:55/km) with 1-min rest  
\- 12x1km at 5:47/mi (3:35/km) pace with 200m rest

Then a 16mi (25km) long run at 6:24/mi (3:59) pace really confirmed my endurance was still there - that run in early January, two weeks before the Houston Half, was a huge mental boost.

What's interesting is that I did almost no tempo runs before the Houston Half. I went in without really knowing what pace I could hold, but somehow pulled off a 1:16 (5:48/mi, 3:37/km). That gave me some confidence heading into Austin.

The three weeks between Houston and Austin were solid: 60mi, 72mi, 65mi (96km, 117km, and 106km).

Key sessions included:

* 25x400m at 5K pace
* 4km marathon pace + 3x1km at HM pace
* 5x3km with 400m rest (2 of those a little slower that marathon pace and 3 a little faster than HM pace)
* 3x2km at HM pace  + 6x500m at 5:20/mi (3:20/km) pace
* 12x1km at marathon pace with 1-min rest
* 19mi (30km) at 6:30/mi (4:03km) pace (marathon course preview) two weeks before the marathon.

**Pre-race**

Race week was pretty straightforward:  
\- Easy 5-7 mi runs at 8:00/mi (5:00/km) pace everyday except 5x1km at HM pace on Tuesday  
\- 3 days before: switched up nutrition: less sugar, red meat, and protein, more carbs (bagels, pasta, pizza, dates, rice, etc)  
\- 2.5 hours before: bowl of oats + coffee, easy 2.5mi run + 3x100m fast  
\- 2 hours before: Skratch energy bar, PB&J toast, 16oz isotonic drink  
\- 30 minutes before: Gu gel

**Race**

The plan was to take the first 5K uphill section slower and then make up time on the next 5K downhill. Started feeling pretty strong and after 10K my average pace was my goal marathon pace. But side stitch started and overall I didn't feel that great. Looking back, it probably started because of that brutal uphill in the first 5K followed by the quick descent which hit me harder than I expected.

The Enfield hills between miles 9-12 (15-20km) were no fun, but there was comfort in familiarity. After getting through them so many times in training, I just didn't see myself breaking there.

Around mile 14 (22km), I got a reality check - spotted a guy far ahead of me running in jeans. It took me until miles 17-19 (28-30km) to finally pass him. There's nothing quite like chasing someone in denim for a few miles at 6:10/mi pace (3:50/km) - really shows you that no matter how good you think you are, there's always someone out there doing something more impressive.

After mile 18, things actually started feeling better. The flats and descents let me lock into a decent 5:55-6:00/mi (3:40-3:46/km) pace, but it was getting harder to maintain. By mile 23 (37km), my legs were screaming, with each step requiring conscious effort. Knowing the notorious hill in the final mile was coming, I was trying to hold the pace for as long as possible. I passed the female leader at mile 24 (39km) and got up the hill at 7:40/mi (4:45/km) pace before giving everything I had left for the final 400m.

Nutrition during the race:  
\- Liquid Gu gel 1 minute before the start  
\- 5 Maurten gels, one for every 26-28 minutes, alternating caffeine/non-caffeine  
\- Water/isotonic drink at nearly every aid station

**Post-race**

Looking at the numbers, I think 2:36-2:37 might be possible on a flat course. The side stitch situation is still a mystery - it keeps showing up in marathons but rarely in training, so there's probably something going on with my nutrition, breathing or hills-pacing that I need to figure out.

Legs got pretty destroyed on those hills, but that's just Austin for you. For now, I'm going to spend a few weeks moving as little as possible, then start building towards Chicago. After battling Austin's hills, a flat course sounds pretty appealing right now.

I met my best friend in college and she‚Äôs just like me, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever meet anyone who I can vibe with, or share the same backstory, humor, interests, morales or anything, like it‚Äôs impossible. She‚Äôs also from America and we moved from in the same year here, it‚Äôs fucking insane, but she has had a bad childhood here, where she was bullied and made to feel insecure about herself which is wild cuz she‚Äôs really pretty and talented, but anyway, she‚Äôs had a boyfriend for 6 years now and hes not really caring and he‚Äôs avoidant. He‚Äôs not even here half of the time cuz he plays soccer and they don‚Äôt share anything in common. I feel like him being popular in high school helped suppress her insecurities. She‚Äôs been having issues w him for the past year and a half and I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll do anything about it cuz she kinda worships him I feel.. even though he isn‚Äôt there for her. She‚Äôs gonna be sad for months and he‚Äôll do some basic thing like order coffee or stay awake on vc during our exams and she‚Äôll be happy again and the cycle just repeats. Idk how she forgets the hours I spent reading the news to help her fall asleep when she came back and everything else that I do.

And on the other hand I really feel under appreciated.. I influenced her personality so much that her music taste, fashion sense and even hobbies like fragrances are cuz of me and I have never recieved any form of appreciation. Not to mention the amount of time I‚Äôve spent being there for her and making her happy cuz she‚Äôs sad about this shit most of the time. I‚Äôm not even complaining, I‚Äôm just like that for the people I care about

It‚Äôs so crazy that she takes what she wants from me and looks down on me and looks up to her bf she has no future w only cuz he had clout in high school. It‚Äôs so frustrating that she rips off my personality and itreally hurts my self esteem the out of everyone in the world who could appreciate me for me it would be her.. she‚Äôs literally my twin, yet she‚Äôs choosing this random ass robot over me?? It‚Äôs not even like we get Americans or even good ppl around here that I can date.

Its really hard to hang out w here rn cuz it just hurts thinking about this stuff, but I feel like I‚Äôm dependent on her cuz she‚Äôs my bestest friend and I don‚Äôt think I can share what I share with her with anyone else. I don‚Äôt know how this shit doesn‚Äôt bother her. She doesn‚Äôt really have any other friends here and her sister moved away so she‚Äôs alone so I don‚Äôt think I have it in me to abandon her and idk if I can even tell her how I feel because she‚Äôs had one best friend before that started liking her and acted jealous and annoying which led them to not being friends anymore.

I can‚Äôt detach cuz I‚Äôm very emotional and my biggest weakness  is that I‚Äôm too caring. I feel really sad that we‚Äôre 23 now and college is almost over and I‚Äôm still alone.

1iscw5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/chuckklostermAIn/comments/1iscw5j/the_paradox_of_normalcy_how_hubslife_became_a/,The Paradox of Normalcy: How @hubslife Became a Meme of His Own Existence,"There‚Äôs something deeply, almost cosmically funny about a person filming themselves doing nothing. Not¬†*literally*¬†nothing, of course‚Äîjust the kind of nothing we all do, which is the everything of existing. @hubslife understood this. For years, he documented the unremarkable rhythms of his HR job in Dallas: the fluorescent-lit meetings about meetings, the Excel spreadsheets that somehow expanded like kudzu, the ritualistic coffee breaks that felt less like pauses and more like rehearsals for death. His shtick was ‚Äúnormalizing the norm,‚Äù a phrase so aggressively bland it could only thrive online. People loved it. Or, more accurately, they loved how it made them feel about themselves‚Äîlike their own unremarkable lives were secretly remarkable, or at least tolerable. But then @hubslife did the most predictable thing imaginable: He quit. Now he films himself filming himself, and his followers are furious. This was never part of the script.

The appeal of @hubslife was never about aspiration. It was about validation. His audience didn‚Äôt want to¬†*be*¬†him; they wanted him to¬†*be*¬†them. Every clip of him sighing at a printer jam or microwaving leftovers in a Tupperware coffin was a mirror held up to the collective soul of white-collar America. It was like watching a nature documentary where the gazelle accepts its fate as lion food. But here‚Äôs the twist: The moment @hubslife escaped the savannah, the gazelle became the lion. Or maybe a zookeeper. Or maybe just a guy in a lion costume, pretending to understand the ecosystem he once inhabited. The specifics don‚Äôt matter. What matters is that he changed the premise, and in doing so, exposed the unspoken contract between online creators and their audiences:¬†*You exist to make me feel better about not existing differently.*

The backlash is telling. Comments on his new videos oscillate between performative disappointment (‚ÄúSold out, huh?‚Äù) and genuine existential confusion (‚ÄúBut who will validate my commute now?‚Äù). It‚Äôs as if his followers believed his original content was a documentary instead of a performance‚Äîas though his ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was a static state, rather than a character he played. This is the paradox of relatability: The more authentic someone seems, the less we tolerate their humanity. When @hubslife was a cubicle drone with a camera, he was a hero. Now that he‚Äôs a full-time ‚Äúcreator,‚Äù he‚Äôs a traitor. The subtext is clear:¬†*You were supposed to make us feel OK about being stuck. How dare you get unstuck?*

What does this say about capitalism? Everything. And nothing. @hubslife‚Äôs pivot is the logical endpoint of a culture that monetizes authenticity until authenticity becomes a brand. His ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was always a product; he just upgraded to a premium subscription. But the real tension here isn‚Äôt about selling out‚Äîit‚Äôs about the impossibility of¬†*not*¬†selling out. In 2024, the only way to escape the grind is to grind differently, often in ways that alienate the very people who cheered your suffering. The 9-to-5 was @hubslife‚Äôs content; quitting it was his content‚Äôs sequel. Both are capitalist narratives. The difference is that one let his audience pretend their lives had meaning, and the other forced them to confront that they‚Äôre still paying $14.99 a month for the delusion.

This is the Faustian bargain of modern content creation: To escape the mundane, you must turn the mundane into a commodity. But once you do, the commodity demands reinvention. @hubslife isn‚Äôt a person anymore; he‚Äôs a premise. His followers aren‚Äôt mad because he changed‚Äîthey‚Äôre mad because his change reminds them that¬†*they*¬†could change too, but probably won‚Äôt. His pivot is a live-action version of the ‚ÄúSkip Intro‚Äù button they‚Äôre too afraid to click.

And that‚Äôs the joke, right? The internet thrives on the myth that anyone can reinvent themselves, but it punishes those who actually try. @hubslife‚Äôs crime isn‚Äôt ambition; it‚Äôs clarity. He revealed the truth we all know but refuse to admit: Normalcy isn‚Äôt a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a cage with excellent Wi-Fi. And the second you stop performing your own captivity, the audience starts booing.

So here we are. A guy in Dallas films himself working, and it‚Äôs art. He films himself not working, and it‚Äôs betrayal. The lesson isn‚Äôt that online fandom is fickle. It‚Äôs that fandom, like capitalism, requires a villain to root against and a hero to ignore. @hubslife was both, until he wasn‚Äôt. Now he‚Äôs just a guy with a camera, doing the only thing that ever made sense: documenting the absurdity of documenting anything at all.

Maybe that‚Äôs the most normal thing he‚Äôs ever done.",1,1739886021.0,chuckklostermAIn,1,1.0,False

since i moved here i had to get completely new friends and ive also been trying to lose weight since i was overeating from the stress of this so i joined a gym and started making really nice friends there quickly and over the last month i have a whole new friend group starting with ‚ÄòAnh‚Äô (fake name for her privacy) who gave me so much support in stopping binge eating and being more positive with my body and healthy at the gym. this has been so amazing and helpful. not only do i have sister and her boyfriend and my beautiful nephew but ive had such great friends around me to support me.

things have only recently not been so good because one of my girlfriends from the gym (call her ‚ÄòEm‚Äô) was introduced to one of my sisters boyfriends friends when i bought her and Anh over one time, another foreign man from africa and they have started dating each other. im really happy for them both and i thought all of our friends would be too but i overheard Anh and another friend say some bad gossip in the gym when they thought i couldnt hear them. i wont type what they were saying beacuse its not nice but it was backwards thinking and really heartbreaking. i was so shocked and surprised to hear that kind of attitude i thought belonged in the village with my parents and not in the city but it can still be found here sadly.

im most embarrassed i didnt confront Anh the others at the time i just was too shocked and wasnt brave enough. because i didnt say anything at the time it started getting bad very quickly and Em was isolated from the group. i dont know the full details of the drama, but i think Anh was jealous of Em? i cant think of any reason why she would behave like this so suddenly?

Em stopped getting invited to things and the other girls including Anh started going to the gym at different times to us. So Em and I decided just to go for coffee alone together and we bumped into Anh and the rest. we were a bit shy to say anything but we were still polite and smiled and said some small talk as we went on and just as we left someone said a joke that me and Em didnt hear and they old started laughing. it was obvious it was a joke at us. 

i do feel really bad not being loyal to Anh and being a close friend because she was so extremely good to me helping me start getting back to shape and quit binge eating with her support, but how can i chose sides with her over Em who did nothing wrong?

i really dont know how to fix this or if there is even a way.

**Dear \[Agent's Name\],**

I am seeking representation for my 75,000-word contemporary upmarket novel, MADE FOR RADIO, for fans of *Yellowface* by R.F. Kuang and *Happy Hour* by Marlowe Granados.

Claudia Medsen has a voice made for radio ‚Äî that‚Äôs what fast food drive-through workers, doctors‚Äô office receptionists, and ex-lovers have always told her. But she never gave anyone‚Äôs comments much thought until her mother tells her she has breast cancer and no money to pay for treatment. Now, Claudia is forced to use her voice to make cash, and fast.

Claudia‚Äôs cry for help is answered when she is discovered by a voiceover agent at the coffee shop where she works and is staffed to narrate the latest hot book by renowned author Lemon Lenox. When the audiobook goes live, Claudia is thrust into frenzied fame as social media mavens attempt to uncover who the woman behind the captivating voice is.

When her identity is revealed, Claudia struggles to navigate her personal life under the pressure of her newfound fame. Her secrets are susceptible to being torn into by internet sleuths, and she continuously makes missteps, including disclosing embarrassing details on a viral podcast segment. Meanwhile, a concerned and watchful Lemon will do anything to keep her own reputation intact and her book far from bad press, even if it means preying on Claudia‚Äôs downfall.

What Claudia once believed to be a one-and-done job snowballs into a personal and professional catastrophe that risks not only destroying her new career but also her ability to save her mother‚Äôs life.

Last is someone who matched a week or so ago, we exchanged a couple of low key messages. I'd have asked to meet for coffee, except with a second meet with an IRL prospect coming up, I don't want to add someone else to the mix. She hasn't asked to meet, so I figure i can leave it on read.

1iscdp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CityNerd/comments/1iscdp9/should_i_be_worried_about_pollution_from_a_nearby/,"Should I be worried about pollution from a nearby motorway? Question about the recent video ""Why living next to a freeway is highly questionable""","**TLDR**: 

Recent video scared the crap out of me. I'm 600m/~1900ft from a major highway in one direction; and 150m/~490ft from a 'minor highway' in the other direction. There are some trees and sound barriers - but not sure how concerned I should be about health impacts - given various mitigating and aggravating factors, and where I can confirm/assuage worries. The more I read the more conflicting information I seem to run into. 

**Details** 

So I saw this video and I was very concerned - but the more I try to look into it, the less clear I am on how worried I should be? I figured someone here might know more. 

I live in a ground-floor apartment, which sits, basically, in the large fork between two major roads. To the west is my garden, then basically 600m of forested type area, with a few small laneways/roadways and small houses within it, then a major highway running perpendicular to my viewpoint (120kph; 2 lanes both ways). To the east my apartment looks straight down a ~150m small, residential road (My apartment building is at the end of the cul-de-sac basically), lined with semi-detached houses; at the end of which I can see a wall, soundbarrier and a few rows of trees. Beyond that wall is a highway-transition type road - it's ~1km long and serves as an exit from the motorway, where traffic slows form 120 to 60kph before hitting a roundabout and splitting into several smaller roads that run away from me. I am closer to the slower end, but not by much. 

There are a lot of trees between me and the motorway; but basically only a couple rows of trees and 150m between me and the exit-road. The sound-proofing must be very good because, except a distant hum at the busiest times, you can't hear either road outside; let alone inside. 

I love my home. Despite it maybe sounding grim here, it has excellent transport connections (6 minute walk to a bus stop that gets several routes arriving every 2-3 minutes at busy times; and runs 24/7; 20 minute walk to the tram; 6 minute cycle to the train); <10 minute 100% protected cycle-lane cycle (except 1 stroad crossing) to the local shop, a couple coffee shops, the vet/doctor, the nearest restaurant etc. The neightbours and community are all so nice. It's extremely safe (A car - that was left unlocked - was 'broken into' a few months ago - and it is still a massive drama. it's the worst thing that's ever happened to these people). being on the ground floor gives me extra storage- a garden, a terrace, a shed, outdoor space. The building is designed perfectly such that the terrace/garden/bay windows etc are all completely private. It's a roomy two bed that's bright, airy, warm and easy to maintain. Sometimes I sit in my dressing gown on my terrace looking out into the forest, listening to the birds and the wind; and feel like I'm alone in the middle of the wilderness. It's basically my dream come true. I have this terrible gnawing feeling that there must be some catch that i'd have something nice... and then I saw this video and am suddenly worried slowly poisoning my family might be the catch after all... but I'm very conscious that this might be my own internal biases flaring up. 

**More specific details**: 

* Distance to major highway: 600m/1900ft; distance to 'minor' highway/slipway 150m/490ft 

* The prevailing wind where I live is from W/SW to E/NE (so, from the major motorway, towards my home, from my home towards minor highway) 

* generally a cold, wet climate in western Europe. 

* My home is equipped only with gas fired central heating: No AC, no air filtration of any kind. I just open the windows once a day or so. 

* The motorway overall gets 150,000 cars per day -- but no clear stats on that stretch specifically; or how much use the closer minor highway/slipway gets. 

* I've lived here 1 year. I haven't seen any noticeable effects (black dust, grime, getting sick) 

* I own the apartment, don't rent - so although I'm not totally powerless to move, it would be a huge decision. 

* There's a small elevation difference to the smaller highway (it's sunk ~10-15ft) 

**What I'm looking for**: 

On the face of it, does this fall into the category of 'worrying' or no? 

On the one hand, I'm between 2 highways, with one well within the 600ft threshold most of the studies cited... but there's lots of trees, soundwalls, green spaces which I think (hope) help air quality also. It's just very, very unclear how much these mitigating factors affect the health outcomes all these studies are listing. 

Does anyone either (A) know themselves how this all shakes out in terms of health impact (B) have a good resource that'll help me assess the impact with respect to all the mitigating factors (like greenery, soundwalls, distance, etc) and aggravating factors (like there being not 1 but 2 motorways). 

I did recently, by coincidence, have my regular checkup with my doctor and he found nothing wrong with me -- but when I mentioned air quality in passing, he was pretty straight with me that he didn't have the first idea about air pollution science and it was outside his wheelhouse. Who do I even ask about this stuff if not my doctor... My local political representatives?",2,1739884432.0,CityNerd,1,1.0,False
1iscdhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1iscdhb/representation_of_cannabis_in_visual_arts/,Representation of Cannabis in Visual Arts,"The earliest dated¬†[depiction of a marijuana leaf](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4256701?seq=1)¬†‚Äì though endlessly debated ‚Äì is thought to be in the form of a cave painting from the Neolithic Era (around 10,000-5,000 BC) in Kyushu, Japan. Whether it is indeed illustrative of a marijuana leaf, or may be a palm or aloe as some contest, humans have been creating images of veneration for cannabis in various forms throughout history. It has been one of the most versatile, important plants in the history of civilization, used and cultivated and revered for thousands of years. Throughout the 20th century however, the fraught relationship of modern societies and governments to the plant made it illegal, difficult to study, and unavailable to scientists and artists alike.

In more recent years, the legalization of marijuana in several US states, as well as the Canadian legalization nationwide in 2017 has led to a new genre of visual art: one centered on the beauty and spectacular detail of the cannabis plant. Images of marijuana have for a long time been somewhat dismissed by the high art world as belonging on cheap, stoner garb and black light posters. However, cannabis is now more visible than ever in popular culture, and as a result it is reaching the world of contemporary art. ¬†

In September of 2017, the Museum of Natural History at the University of Colorado, Boulder, created a show that would give museum-goers a very original exhibition: one that focused solely on the visual allure of cannabis. The¬†[Rocky Mountain Society of Botanical Artists](http://www.jstor.org/stable/48502865)¬†hosted and curated¬†[Cannabis: A Visual Perspective](https://www.colorado.edu/cumuseum/cannabis), and challenged artists to take a serious approach to the cannabis plant, wishing to shuck the unrefined and perhaps immature depictions of weed leaves previously synonymous with it. The result was a collection of illustrations rendered in water colour, acrylic, oil, coloured pencil, pastel print, and mixed media. The exhibition was the first of its kind in the United States, and it drew worldwide attention for its detailed approach to the subject, which pushed typical cultural associations and uses aside to focus on the natural beauty of the plant. ¬†

That same year in Canada, an exhibition titled¬†[\#Grassland](https://www.gallerieswest.ca/magazine/stories/grassland-smokin-show/)¬†was hosted by the Penticton Art Gallery in British Columbia. The country‚Äôs first-ever public-gallery art show focused on marijuana and included glassware, an emerging sculptural trend in the art world. While the #Grassland exhibition took place during the peak of excitement surrounding Canada‚Äôs legalization of marijuana, curator¬†[Paul Crawford had long wanted to explore](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/marijuana-art-exhibit-grassland-penticton-1.3993283)¬†the complicated nature of cannabis in the public sphere, citing ‚Äúthe tacit complicity everyone seemed to have towards the industry, including the RCMP.‚Äù This complex relationship of Canadian culture to pot became even more intriguing to Crawford when he found out that pipe-and-bong-maker Patrick ‚ÄúRedbeard‚Äù Vrolyk had won the 2015 Visual Artist Prize from the Penticton Arts Council. ¬†

In an interview with¬†[*Canadian Art*](https://canadianart.ca/)¬†magazine, Crawford said ‚ÄúI was fascinated that our conservative town here would award a guy making bongs the artist-of-the-year award ‚Ä¶ It also made me look at something I‚Äôd never considered high art‚Äîjust that piece of glass sitting on my friend‚Äôs coffee table. It was a fascinating thing to delve into that whole world.‚Äù

The glasswork of Vrolyk was included in the #Grassland show, while simultaneously in New York, the non-profit art space Apexart presented ‚Äú[Outlaw Glass](https://apexart.org/images/bienenstock.php)‚Äù, bringing together glassware by 50 makers across North America. The show paid homage in particular to Bob Snodgrass, a maker of pipes and bongs who innovated certain techniques in the field, and shared them with other makers. Presented in mirrored display cases in a gallery setting, the functional objects read more as small-scale sculpture than as drug paraphernalia.

Cannabis has not only changed the art world visually, in one instance, it has given rise to cannabis as a whole new artistic medium. In 2018, Spanish graffiti artist¬†[Sea 162](https://sea162.com/)¬†created a mural using an ink he created from 70 grams of weed, 70 grams of hash and another extra 100 grams to produce canna-oil. The artwork, entitled ‚Äú[Cannabis Lupus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGOL7C9-DWw&t=84s)‚Äù went viral for its groundbreaking use of cannabis as a material of creation rather than as a subject matter. Sea 162 calls this new method cannArt, which celebrates the relationship between marijuana and art, and utilizes the Earth‚Äôs natural environment as a source for both materials and inspiration. ¬†

The world has come a long way since you were in your best friend‚Äôs basement, looking up at his brother‚Äôs wall hang of a weed-leaf wearing sunglasses and tie-dye shorts, and so too has the art world. The cannabis plant is now a thing as worthy of careful, detailed depiction as any flower, and the tools of its use are now glittering in the same lighting as Picasso‚Äôs absinthe spoon. Respect for the cannabis plant continues to grow in a world coming full circle, returning to a place of acceptance and celebration for the gifts the plant bestows to our health, to our culture, and to our art. The endless metamorphosis of the art world is a perfect place for our ideas about cannabis to stew and develop and emerge as artistic works that continue to challenge and excite a population about political issue still in flux.

I currently work in the kitchen. Long story short the company I work for got bought by another company slightly over a month ago and the place has became an ABSOLUTE nightmare to work at.

Constantly finishing an 1.5hrs-2hrs past the shift end time (it's not a restaurant) due to managers not being able to organize the stock deliveries properly etc.
They started to put such extreme amount of work on us right now that everybody on the team literally works 3 times as much as we did before they bough the company and so on.

It came to a point that I'm actually scared every evening that I have to go there next morning. I can barely even sleep for the past month which combined with being pressured to do such ridiculously high amount of work per person really destroyed my mental health.

I have even randomly started falling asleep due to being tired so much all the time.

Now, my contractual notice period is 1 month.
My close friend told me that they have a vacancy at a private coffee shop she works at and that I could start there immediately if she speaks to her boss. She said he won't even need references if the current job would refuse to give them if I'd quit on the spot.

I know for a fact, given the area that said coffee shop is located at, that it would be a far less stressful than what I'm doing right now and would definitely help me not actually ending up with a depression.

Anyway, what are my options? I honestly do not want to work a single day of my notice period in the current place given how toxic it became after the above mentioned company buy out.

I would really appreciate some help, as I honestly am on the verge of a mental breakdown in the current workplace :(.",1,1739883637.0,UKJobs,9,0.6,False

I also get pleaure from things like socialising, going on walks, working out, watching movies

Anyways. I'm a polyaddict. I have quit  every single drug i've abused, which is all except mushrooms. And life is a LOT better this way, no doubt at all

But now i drink insane amounts of caffeine. Both coffee, energy drinks and caffeine pills. Btw I don't have adhd or add. Caffeine amps me up, but i'm so exhausted all the time because of my OCD, ovethinking and insomnia. Caffeine literally makes them all worse, but i just want to feel 'something'. Ideally I would drink, since alcohol 'helps' with every single problem is have short term, but i can't do that

I also use so much time on social media (especially instagram and reddit). Need to check them 3.000 times a day

I feel like i need to be constantly stimulated, also with music all the time. I don't want to, it's exhausting. I'm just so scared of silence and my own thougts and feelings

I feel like I have to give everything up. Obviously drugs and nicotine is a no brainer. But even caffeine and social media. I can't find a balance with ANYTHING that gives me pleasure (unless it's healthy). I don't want to quit caffeine and social media, because i like them, but i feel like i 'need to' because it's all or nothing with everything

1isbof1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1isbof1/e24_must_have_accessories_advice/,E24 must have accessories advice,"Hey,

I will get an E24 in (hopefully) 2 weeks and want to prepare the must-have accessories.  
I wonder what comes with the E24 and what must be bought separately.

tl;dr: My main question is: Does the E24 comes only with pressurized baskets?  
  
I know that there are several nice-to-have upgrades. For example, I heard that a bottom-less portafilter would be good, but the portafilter coming with the machine is good enough (besides the handle).

So, for the must-haves, I assume:  
\- a WDT or a shaker for distribution. Because of the workflow I will get a WDT (besides trusting Lance)  
\- a scale: I will get the cheapest (17 Euro) one from Amazon. Has a timer, has auto-start, though one should manually start when pressing the switch, and not when the first drop comes  
\- a non-pressurized basket? Is there one coming with the machine? In the [manual](https://www.gaggia.com/app/uploads/2023/11/6420-010-18421-MANUAL-GAG.-CLASSIC-E24-EU-Rev-00.pdf?_gl=1*zmk8ko*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTQ2NTkzNzAzNi4xNzM5ODgwNzY4*_ga_MP9Y4T6CVY*MTczOTg4MDc2Ny4xLjAuMTczOTg4MDc2Ny4wLjAuMA..) it looks like there are two, with different sizes. But are they both pressurized?  
\- A Tamper and a funnel: Is there a funnel, that fits the portafilter and can be used with an auto-leveling tamper to tamp-through the funnel? Probably that is not a thing. And I never used a tamper before. I assume that I need a funnel to not make a mess using the WDT, a small one, so I can grind from my DF54 directly into the basket ... and a auto-leveling tamper, as I never tamped before. To not make a mess, I would like to tamp through the funnel ... or is after WDT'ing the coffee flat enough to not spill over? Or is that where you use a leveler, which looks not necessary to me?  
  
If you have suggestions for different stuff you deem must-have, please mention it - but let's not come into a ""must-have"" or ""nice-to-have"" war.  
I guess all can agree that a   
\- non-pressurized basket  
\- non-plastic tamper  
\- distribution tool (e.g. WDT)  
\- scale with 0.1g precision  
are must-haves.

Ozak‚Äôs Prediction Agents work like your personal Netflix algorithm - but for money. Tell it your goals (saving for kids? Retiring early? YOLOing for a Lambo?), and it curates a playlist of crypto moves that actually fit your life.

Imagine you‚Äôre Maria, a nurse from London. You set your PA to ‚Äúaggressive growth‚Äù and let it auto-trade while you worked night shifts. In 3 months, your $5K became $18K. How? The AI spotted price gaps between exchanges (arbitrage ü§ì) and executed trades faster than you could brew coffee.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: you don‚Äôt need to be a pro. The PA learns your risk tolerance like Netflix learns you hate rom-coms. It scans markets 24/7 (using Ozak‚Äôs real-time data nets) and auto-adjusts your portfolio. Think ‚Äúskip intro‚Äù but for dodging bad trades.

I was about halfway through my day at work when I was checking Reddit in the bathroom (boss makes a dollar, I make a dime), when I saw a notification, and checked it out of habit. When I saw it was from here, I assumed that it was just an announcement that the drawing was taking place and there was no way I could have won. When I reread it, I was shocked and I honestly cried a little, since I never expected something like this to happen for me, much less on my first entry. I've been having a hard time with rent and student loan payments now that I live alone, so any amount helps.

Talking about myself isn't really a strong point of mine so this might feel a little stilted. I am based out of the PNW, so most of my time is spent in the great outdoors hiking, fishing, and just being a general bum. I've also been getting into gaming now that the sun is hiding, so I spend most of my time inside scrolling reddit or playing games like Elden Ring and Stardew Valley.

Any donations will probably go towards paying down student debt and gas to get to and from work, so any amount really helps. I'll definitely save a bit for future donations to future winners, since I don't think I could live with myself without giving back to this community, and a bit might go towards not eating beans and ramen next week haha. I really like the idea behind the community you all have built here, and I'm excited to be a member and contribute back to the community. You are all so generous with this concept.

**Study Guide for Complex Adult Health (NR 341)**

**Introduction**

Complex Adult Health (NR 341) provides in-depth understanding and application of nursing concepts for adult patients with complex health conditions. This study guide will review key concepts, critical skills, and sample questions to prepare you for the course and exam successfully.

The contents of this study guide are based on the resources found [**Click Here**](https://rnstudentresources.com/shop/search?query=341)**. If you can, get them!**

¬†

**Key Concepts**

**1.¬†Prioritization of Care**

Understanding how to prioritize care is vital in acute settings. The nurse must make decisions on the most critical needs first.

**Example:**  
When reviewing new orders for a patient, assess which interventions have the highest priority:

* **BiPAP Therapy**: Often prioritized in patients with respiratory distress (e.g., BiPAP 10 cm iPAP/5 cm ePAP, FiO2 40%).
* **X-ray and Lab Tests**: While important, these can often wait until more immediate interventions are addressed.

**Sample Question:**  
For a patient with respiratory distress, which two orders should the nurse implement first?

* A) Comprehensive Metabolic Panel
* B) Azithromycin 500 mg IV every 24 hours
* C) Insert an indwelling urinary catheter
* D) BiPAP 10 cm iPAP/5 cm ePAP, FiO2 40% ‚úîÔ∏è
* E) Complete Blood Count
* F) Chest X-ray ‚úîÔ∏è

**Correct Answers:**¬†D and F.

**2.¬†Understanding Mechanical Ventilation**

Patients who are intubated require special attention, particularly in managing anxiety and sedation effectively.

**Key Actions:**

* Identify the cause of distress.
* Monitor sedation levels.
* Provide reassurance to reduce patient anxiety.

**Sample Question:**  
What action should the nurse take for a client receiving mechanical ventilation who is anxious?

* A) Identify the cause of distress and provide reassurance ‚úîÔ∏è
* B) Increase the rate for the ordered propofol infusion
* C) Sedate with midazolam IV push
* D) Manually ventilate with a bag-valve-mask device

**Correct Answer:**¬†A) Identify the cause of distress and provide reassurance.

**3.¬†Post-Operative Care and Pacemaker Management**

Post-surgical patients, particularly those with pacemakers, require careful education to promote safety and health.

**Education Points:**

* Inform patients about avoiding specific environments (i.e., microwaves, metal detectors).
* Emphasize checking pulse daily.

**Sample Question:**  
Which information should the nurse include in the plan following pacemaker insertion? (Select all that apply)

* A) Do not have a microwave oven in the home.
* B) Avoid walking through antitheft devices.
* C) Handheld metal detectors should not be placed directly over the pacemaker.
* D) Do not drive until cleared by the healthcare provider.
* E) Count your pulse for one minute each morning. ‚úîÔ∏è

**Correct Answers:**¬†C, D, E.

**4.¬†Recognizing Emergency Situations**

Knowing when to activate the rapid response team is crucial in preventing further deterioration of patients.

**Indications for Rapid Response:**

* Significant changes in consciousness or vital signs
* Symptoms of respiratory difficulty or bleeding

**Sample Question:**  
For which clients should the rapid response team be activated? (Select all that apply)

* A) Client receiving heparin infusion and bleeds from IV sites ‚úîÔ∏è
* B) Post-operative patient in severe pain rated 8/10.
* C) DNR client who stops breathing
* D) ICU client with coffee ground vomitus ‚úîÔ∏è
* E) Appendicitis patient with a BP of 74/44 mm Hg ‚úîÔ∏è

**Correct Answers:**¬†A, D, E.

**5.¬†Medications and Continuous Infusions**

Understanding the medications being administered continuously is essential for safe patient care.

**Key Considerations:**

* Monitor vital signs and lab results regularly.
* Identify potential side effects or complications.

**Sample Question:**  
A patient receiving dexmedetomidine for agitation. For which clinical manifestations should the nurse anticipate decreasing the infusion rate? (Select all that apply)

* A) Triglyceride level 302 mg/dL
* B) Blood pressure 86/48 mmHg ‚úîÔ∏è
* C) Blood pressure 142/78 mmHg
* D) Heart rate 54 beats per minute ‚úîÔ∏è
* E) Heart rate 102 beats per minute

**Correct Answers:**¬†B, D.

**6.¬†Assessment Techniques and Data Collection**

Effective assessment skills are critical to identifying patient needs accurately and formulating a plan of care.

**Conducting Assessments:**

* Collect comprehensive data, including vital signs, health history, and physical examinations.
* Use assessment findings to prioritize nursing diagnoses.

**7.¬†Patient Communication and Advocacy**

Strong communication skills are vital for advocating for patients and ensuring their needs are met.

**Effective Communication Practices:**

* Use clear, empathetic language when discussing health issues.
* Facilitate understanding through teach-back methods to ensure patient comprehension.

**8.¬†Interpreting Diagnostic Tests**

Understanding common diagnostic tests and their implications aids in clinical decision-making.

* Familiarize yourself with lab values, imaging results, and their clinical relevance.
* Prioritize critical lab findings that may require immediate action.

**9.¬†Multidisciplinary Team Collaboration**

Working effectively within a multidisciplinary team improves patient outcomes.

**Collaboration Principles:**

* Share assessment findings openly with other healthcare professionals.
* Participate in care planning and care coordination efforts.

**10.¬†Patient Safety Protocols**

Incorporating safety practices into daily care helps prevent harm and promote recovery.

**Safety Measures:**

* Implement fall prevention strategies.
* Ensure medication safety protocols are in place.

**Conclusion**

This study guide serves as a resource for mastering the principles of Complex Adult Health (NR 341). Effective application of these concepts is essential for providing high-quality patient care. Focus on mastering assessment skills, prioritization, and collaboration with the healthcare team to enhance your nursing practice.

**Study Tips**

1. **Engage in Simulation Labs**: Practice hands-on skills to build confidence in assessments and interventions.
2. **Utilize Group Studies**: Discuss complex scenarios with peers to gain different perspectives.
3. **Review Clinical Guidelines**: Familiarize yourself with current best practices in adult health nursing.

1isblad,https://www.reddit.com/r/20minutebooks/comments/1isblad/tiny_habits_book_summary/,Tiny Habits - Book Summary,"**Discover the Power of Tiny Habits for Lasting Change**

In BJ Fogg's book ""Tiny Habits,"" the idea is simple yet transformative: **small, manageable changes can lead to significant life improvements.** Instead of overhauling your life with massive goals, focus on tiny adjustments that seamlessly fit into your daily routine. For example, if you aim to get fit, start with just two push-ups a day. These small steps gradually rewire your brain, making new habits as natural as your morning coffee.

BJ Fogg, a behavioral expert from Stanford, lays out a framework for understanding and implementing tiny habits. The key is not relying solely on motivation or willpower, which can wane over time. Instead, use **action prompts**‚Äîexisting behaviors in your routine‚Äîto trigger new habits effortlessly.

Consider the simplicity of doing two push-ups every time you flush the toilet. This tiny habit is easy, requires minimal effort, and can lead to more significant changes over time. 

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Motivation, ability, and prompts** are the engines of behavior change.
- Make habits easy to perform to increase their likelihood of sticking.
- Use existing behaviors in your routine as prompts for new habits.

""Tiny Habits"" is perfect for those wanting to make meaningful changes without feeling overwhelmed. **Start small to achieve big.**

I've evidence that uni can get work done in 3 weeks yet thus disability adjustment taking months.

Second issue disabled toilet, I'm severely incontinent. 
Occ health & access to work disabaled needs assessment recommend radar lock adjustment refused. 

Wall seat in toilet to help me get changed & sit to apply creams nstead of struggling on toilet.  Itll also keep my feet free & out of possible urine splashes on the floor as wall seat is opposite the toilet, adjustment refused.

Two external assessments state the toilet is below size for wheelchair users & current regs. 
They're refusing the wall seat as it will affect the turning circle for wheelchair users.
The first assessment that came out of an access to work report, they quote the Equality Act. 
The second, most recent assessment was done by the University they quote the DDA, which doesn't even exist anymore.

Not sure what to do next.
5 years of evidence of the toilet being left filthy, fixtures broken. A unit where I store clean continence products had coffee poured over it.
I'm on a uni campus.
Just these  past few months it's been decided that the toilet is under my employers lease & not uni.

Work state its a public toilet, have to comply with dda, no radar lock no wall seat, so it's still getting used by students.
I go 6/7 times  a day & must have immediate access.
Disability awareness training that came out of grievance, they did one session, my gdpr was severely breached in this & they've cancelled all other sessions.

Oh & work want me to drag a seat from ladies toilet, into corridor, into disabled toilet, use it, drag it back out into corridor, into ladies possibly 6/7 times a day.
October I asked for adjustment bigger unit in toilet as prescribed larger pads, not done.
Lower coat hook as rotator cuff issue, not done.
Manager did state in corridor of staff that she'd tell facilities it was a rotator cuff problem.
They don't need to know  why, just the adjustment. Colleagues also overheard & I'm not happy about it.
Toilet seat is also below regulations height.
Facilities said ventilation couldn't be put in toilet, yet the uni have since put it there. Ducting was already there, facilities didn't even look.

Any advice I'd be grateful.
I've just asked my house insurance to review my case.
But assume I'll have to file another grievance to contact ACAS if they deem I've a worthy case.
Union haven't been the best.

I'm in wales, we're a public body, worked there 20+ years.

Move along haters gonna hate.  I'm not looking for your shade.  

But MEN who have had or currently have an AP, my AP often says he loves me.  While he is very kind, sweet, and seems genuine, I have a difficult time time believing him. 

He says He can't get enough of me because I am addictive and so easy to be around.  We joke a lot and just talk completely real with our filters, we spend time meeting up for coffee, a quick moment to steal a little kiss and a sweet hello here or there when ever we can.  When it's warm enough, we do walks around the lake where we are unlikely to be seen, or go to neighboring town for lunch when it's possible. Simple stuff outside of the bedroom.  It's really nice.  We have great chemistry and quite a bit of fun because conversations are not at all boring or lacking.

He is very sexual, which of course is great, and not usually a problem at all.  He often talks about how much he wants me and of things he can't wait to do together, and things he'd like to introduce to me.  But he doesn't often speak of other things. Which can bother me at times .

Which leads me back to my original question: Is it really possible for some one to love an AP? Or am I a novelty, a toy, that he loves to have around?  I struggle with knowing the difference. I figured men in here would be able to shed some light on this for me.

Everything wuth him was smooth and honestly sometiems i used to stop and wonder that its too good to be true but anyways i wanted to keep good gumaan so i had to divert my thinking. He was amazing at the start. So i met his mother and later i asked him to meet my brother because he apparently this guy makes music so i needed a support from home. Anyways my brother and family were very supportive and he immediately wanted to send rishta without any wait and also asked my father if it was possible to give his answer early because of some personal reasons (i knew about the reasons) everything went well we got engaged in under 2 months. Basically we never had a relationship we decided to just do the baat pakki first and then move forward. Anyways after 3 months he started acting very strange due to some reasons which i got to know just before our breakup. It was aziat honestly i used to cry every night every morning because he wasnt there. He was not giving me time or any details let alone we couldnt even talk. It was always something. (I am not saying he must be lying or whatever because i know he makes music so he must be very busy but the fact it was happening every single day and his actions felt like as if he is cheating or he is not interested anymore) Later when my parents got worried including me so that was an alarming sigh that there were no involvement from his side so when i insisted i got to know the reasons and turned out he is facing some financial crisis to which he predicted that i wont be able to adjust in his family üò≠üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ.

As someone who‚Äôs been *blessed* with an impressive collection of adult toys (we all have our hobbies, right?), I can confidently say this one has earned a permanent spot in my nightstand.

First off, the design. It‚Äôs sleek, discreet, and not the ‚Äúwhat the heck is that?‚Äù kind of weird when you leave it out. I didn‚Äôt have to hide it under the pillow, and trust me, that's a win. Plus, it comes with some attachments‚Äîlet me tell you, this thing‚Äôs versatility rivals that of a Swiss Army knife. There's a reason it's considered one of the *best female masturbators* around, and trust me, I‚Äôm all about efficiency.

Let‚Äôs get to the important part‚Äîhow it works. I took this for a test run (because, who doesn‚Äôt want to?). It has multiple speeds and modes, so you‚Äôre basically in control of how *intense* things get. It‚Äôs like switching between Netflix binge-watching and a full-on Marvel movie marathon. The power behind this is next-level! I won‚Äôt go into TMI territory (we all know what we're here for), but let‚Äôs just say... it did NOT disappoint.

Here‚Äôs a fun comparison: imagine you're making pancakes. Some vibrators are like the sad, uneven pancakes you make at 8 AM when you haven‚Äôt had your coffee yet. The Tracy‚Äôs Dog Wand? That‚Äôs like the perfectly golden, fluffy pancake you get at brunch on a Sunday morning. Consistent, smooth, and leaving you *satisfied*.

Also, the battery life is impressive, and trust me, I‚Äôve had my share of ‚Äúoops, forgot to charge‚Äù moments. This one kept going, and going, and I actually had to stop before it did! (Not a bad problem to have).

Long story short, if you're looking for the [best female masturbator](https://amzn.to/4hE55d1) that‚Äôs powerful, reliable, and downright enjoyable, do yourself a favor and get the Tracy‚Äôs Dog Wand Vibrator Kit.

# The Magic of Air-Pulse Technology:

Now, the real reason I‚Äôm writing this review: the air-pulse technology. This is the feature that sets the **Satisfyer Pro 2** apart from the rest. It‚Äôs not your average vibration ‚Äì it‚Äôs a gentle yet powerful suction-like feeling that *mimics the sensation of oral stimulation*.

Is this what it feels like when a perfect match happens in a movie?‚Äù Seriously, it‚Äôs *that* good.

# Real-Life Example:

Okay, let me be real with you. Last week, I had a bit of a stressful day. Work was a mess, I couldn‚Äôt get my coffee to taste right (don‚Äôt judge me, coffee is serious business), and I was just generally *not* in a good mood. But then, I decided to take a little self-care moment and try out the Satisfyer Pro 2 again.

Within minutes, I had forgotten all about my awful day. I‚Äôm talking about a deep, almost zen-like relaxation. *Your girl was floating in a cloud of pleasure.* I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe how effective this thing is. I‚Äôm not saying I reached Nirvana, but let‚Äôs just say the stress melted away, and I had a *much* better evening.

# The Silent Power:

Something else I love about the [Satisfyer Pro 2](https://amzn.to/4hDyCDy) is how quiet it is. We‚Äôve all been there ‚Äì trying to keep things discreet because, well, life happens. This bad boy is whisper-quiet, so you can enjoy your ‚Äúme-time‚Äù without worrying that your neighbors are gonna start wondering if you‚Äôre having a rave in your bedroom.

# The Verdict:

If you‚Äôre on the hunt for the **best female vibrator**, look no further than the **Satisfyer Pro 2 Vibrator Sex Toy**. It‚Äôs the perfect combination of sleek design, high-tech air-pulse stimulation, and total discretion. Seriously, I‚Äôve tried a lot of different toys, and none have compared to this. If you‚Äôre looking for a toy that‚Äôs both powerful and sophisticated, this is it.

Treat yourself‚Äîyou won‚Äôt regret it. And to anyone who thinks they‚Äôve tried the best already... well, you just haven‚Äôt tried this one yet.

*Pro tip: If you can, use it during a bath for the ultimate relaxation experience. It‚Äôs like a spa day, but better.*",1,1739880701.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False
1isb9sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1isb9sa/honestly_best_female_vibrator_wand/,[HONESTLY] Best Female Vibrator Wand,"Alright, folks, buckle up, because I‚Äôm here to tell you about the *best female vibrator wand* I‚Äôve ever tried ‚Äì the [Ava Vibrator Wand Sex Toys \[Clit Stimulator Vibrators\].](https://amzn.to/3ESHgiV) I didn‚Äôt expect to be this excited about a piece of adult ‚Äútechnology‚Äù (hey, it‚Äôs not a gadget you casually talk about with your friends), but this one really knocked my socks off‚Ä¶ and everything else too, honestly.

I‚Äôve tried my fair share of vibrators, from the palm-sized ones to the ‚Äúdoes this thing even fit in my drawer?‚Äù type, but the Ava wand? Oh, it‚Äôs next level.

# Design & Comfort:

Let‚Äôs start with the design. It‚Äôs sleek, stylish, and a lot less intimidating than some of the wands that look like they could double as home improvement tools. The handle is ergonomic, so no cramping or awkward wrist positions after 10 minutes of use. You know how some wands feel like you're holding onto a brick? Not the Ava. It‚Äôs surprisingly lightweight and easy to maneuver, which is a big plus. No need to take out a second mortgage to afford a good product *and* a chiropractor.

# Power & Performance:

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the power. *Whew.* The first time I turned it on, I half-expected it to start humming the theme song to ""Jaws"" ‚Äî that‚Äôs how strong the vibrations are. This thing packs a punch, and I‚Äôm not talking about a mild buzz. The **Clit Stimulator** feature is no joke either ‚Äî it targets exactly where you need it to, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I got to places I didn‚Äôt even know existed.

Real talk: I once had to pause midway to collect myself. I was getting flashbacks of that one time I tried to multitask while using the vacuum cleaner (never again). It wasn‚Äôt just about the pleasure; it was almost *too* much. In the best way. If you‚Äôre looking for a deep, satisfying experience, look no further.

# Real Life Example:

Let me paint a picture: I was trying to get some work done one afternoon when I saw the Ava sitting there, looking like the innocent wand it is. Naturally, I had to try it out for a ‚Äúquick break.‚Äù Long story short, I‚Äôm not sure how much work actually got done that day. I‚Äôll just say I was really productive in a *different* way.

# Ease of Use & Maintenance:

It‚Äôs also super easy to clean, which is a huge deal for me. I like to treat my toys like my coffee maker: clean them after every use, and don‚Äôt forget about them for weeks. A quick wipe down, and it‚Äôs good as new. Bonus points for being waterproof ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even need to worry if it slips into the tub or shower. It‚Äôs like they thought of everything.

# Conclusion:

All in all, the [Ava Vibrator Wand](https://amzn.to/3ESHgiV) has totally earned its spot in my drawer (and no, it‚Äôs not getting pushed to the back like some of those other toys that never lived up to the hype). If you‚Äôre on the hunt for the **best female vibrator wand**, this is your sign to grab one. It‚Äôs effective, easy to use, and will absolutely elevate your experience. Plus, it doesn‚Äôt come with a ‚Äúlearning curve.‚Äù Seriously, it‚Äôs just plug and play... or vibe and play? You get the idea.

10/10, would recommend to a friend, *and* to a couple of my coworkers. You know who you are.

Let me know if you‚Äôve tried it, I‚Äôm curious! üôÉ",1,1739880674.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False
