So today is my birthday, and I woke early. I thought that was perfect, because then I could just get some time to do some of the things I have to do, before everyone woke up. I am a SAHM, and take care of our child around the clock. My husband is home late pretty much every day, so I rarely get a real break. She woke up pretty much right after I went out of bed haha, so that is what it is. I normally just let my husband sleep in on saturdays, because its the only day he can, but since today is my birthday, I asked if he wanted to come downstairs with us. He then got real angry, and said to just let him sleep, so I went downstairs very dissapointed, but thought okay, im letting you get your sleep. Two hours later, my fuse got pretty short with my toddler, so I asked my husband if he could please come downstairs. He comes down and yells at me again that this is his one day a week where he can sleep. I got very sad, and yelled back, that this is my one day a year, where it's my birthday. He then went to the kithen to make coffee, and I could feel tears come, so I went to the bathroom to get a grip, because I hate to cry in front of others! This feels like a huge overreaction on my part, but I dont know. Its like I dread my birthday every year because I always end up feeling just overlooked somehow, and its not so nice. Im also 21 weeks pregnant, and that might add to both the exhaustion and the emotional state, but I dont know. Do you think this was an overreaction, or signs of something more sinister?

After washing my face I just laid on my bed and realised I was a bit too tired, it's a Saturday so I thought fuck it lemme just rest and close my eyes, I wasn't even expecting to fall asleep. Then the dream started, it was out of nowhere, first I was in some cafe and mind you I thought it was really life, I didn't even know I was dreaming, then a couple feet away from me there was this group they looked like they were discussing something and I sort of overheard the guy saying if he should ""ask him the lighter"" and they looked at me. Right next to me was a coffee table and on that was my lighter I carry with me everywhere so this shit felt so real. And the best part is throughout this dream I saw people phase and I felt hella drowsy too but in my head it didn't register that I was dreaming, in my head I thought this was a regular day and I was just high as fuck, so now I grab my lighter and give it to him but I'm feeling hella drowsy and shit so I'm like wtf wake up dude or they'll know your high, then the dude just stands there he doesn't extend his arm for the lighter or anything and just looks at me, his whole face starts to contort into something so weird and he just tells me I don't have much time, I'm so fucking confused by this I just snap and end up in another area, this time I'm just shaking my head trying to get rid of the high and trying to wake up, mind you in this dream I don't realise it's a dream even at this point, I'm just thinking that I'm high, so I try to atleast lock in and shit then I feel my face muscles twitching and I just shake my head and finally I'm awake on my bed. I look around for a good minute and that's when I realise that I was actually dreaming. This is so weird to me but that was honestly really fun, my first time ever experiencing this sort of shit, it really creeped me out but I wanna do it again, hopefully I'll try actually lucid dreaming and giving it a shot and let you guys know if anything happens.",1,1763798608.0,LucidDreaming,1,1.0,False

Because I thought this offer was locked in, I didn’t go heavy on OCR or broader recruiting this year. I skipped most of the coffee chats, didn’t really network, and didn’t apply to that many firms. Now I’m staring down graduation with nothing lined up and most of the main recruiting windows closed.

What’s the move here? Are people still landing good roles in late winter/spring? Should I be targeting off-cycle roles, boutique consulting, PE/VC portfolio ops, or growth-stage startups? Any LDPs still in the mix? Is it worth looping in career services, or will they just tell me to “network more”?

1p3nn5h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3nn5h,The Adventures of the Mud Queen — Episode 8: “The Train Trip Tragedy (Featuring Coffee)”,"By now, Lila Bellyton had accepted another truth about her life:

Her belly had become a public hazard zone.
Coffee, smoothies, dogs, nachos, pumpkins, garbage… the universe had decided her midriff was the world’s favorite landing pad.

And the internet still wasn’t over her.

People at grocery stores whispered, “It’s her…”
Teenagers at malls shouted “MUD QUEEN POSE!”
Even her own friends teased her—despite not even being there for the dog show.

But the real chaos was about to begin.


---

The Setup: A “Normal” Weekend Trip

It was Friday afternoon when her cousin Laurie bombarded her with a voice message:

> Laurie: “LILA!! Elena is treating us to a weekend trip to Seattle!
Train tickets! Free food! And Sophie is coming because she heard the word Starbucks! PACK A BAG NOW.”



Lila blinked at her phone.

A calm, relaxing train ride?
A quiet trip to visit Elena’s hometown?
A weekend without spills, splashes, or sticky disasters?

Finally… FINALLY… things might go smoothly.

She packed a suitcase, slipped on a cute navy-and-red striped crop top with red pants, and headed to the station with a confident click of her Chanel buckle.

This time, the universe whispered:

You sure about that?


---

Union Station: The Calm Before the Spill

When Lila arrived at the train station, she strutted down the platform like she was in an ad campaign—hair bouncing, suitcase rolling, crop top pristine.

Sophie waved wildly from the seating area.

“LILA! Starbucks on the train! They sell the seasonal drinks! I’m SO READY!”

Elena laughed. “We’ll have a smooth, chill weekend. No drama, no chaos.”

Laurie choked on her coffee.

“Yeah… sure. No chaos around Lila.”

Lila rolled her eyes.
“Oh please. I can go one weekend without becoming a human spill canvas.”

Spoiler:
She could not.


---

The Train Ride of Doom (AKA: The Coffee Incident)

About an hour into the ride, the train café cart rolled through the aisle.

Sophie’s eyes sparkled like she’d seen a golden retriever holding a frappuccino.
“Lila! LET’S GET COFFEE!”

Lila hesitated. “Um… maybe water.”

But Sophie grabbed her arm. “NO. You’re getting the caramel mocha. Trust me.”

So Lila reluctantly carried a hot cup back to her seat.

Elena and Laurie sat across from her, both eyeing her cup like it was a ticking bomb.

Laurie whispered,
“Ten dollars says that mocha ends up—”

“DON’T.”
Lila glared.

She took a sip.
Delicious. Warm. Safe.

And then—
The train hit a tiny, tiny bump.

Just a little vibration.

Not even a real shake.

Just enough for the lid to pop open like:

“SURPRISE!”

The caramel mocha catapulted straight down the front of Lila’s crop top, splashing over her stomach, dripping into her lap, and making her gasp so loudly the entire carriage turned to look.

Even worse?

Her body reacted on instinct.

She raised her arms.

She stuck out her tongue.

She struck the Mud Queen pose.

And Sophie died laughing.

“OH MY GOSH STOP—LILA YOU DID THE POSE—YOU’RE TRENDING AGAIN AND WE’RE NOT EVEN OFF THE TRAIN YET.”

Elena hid her face behind her seat.
Laurie choked laughing.
The elderly man across the aisle clapped.
Someone whispered, “Mud Queen upgraded to Mocha Queen.”

And Lila?

She just let out a long, soul-broken sigh.

“Of course. OF COURSE.”


---

Mid-Ride Madness

Word got around the train fast.

People walked past her seat to sneak photos.
Kids whispered, “She’s the lady from TikTok!”
The café worker offered her extra napkins with an apologetic smile.

Sophie got a new drink.
Elena tried to help clean Lila’s shirt.
Laurie filmed everything.

But the universe had one more surprise waiting.


---

The Final Embarrassment

When they arrived in Seattle, Lila stepped off the train still smelling like warm caramel.

Elena said gently, “At least it can only go up from here…”

Lila nodded.

Then the train doors closed behind her…

And a gust of wind from the departing train blasted forward—

splattering what remained of the puddle on the floor directly back onto Lila’s stomach.

Right on cue, she froze.

Arms raised.

Tongue out.

POSE.

Laurie screamed laughing.
Sophie wheezed.
Elena face-palmed so hard she nearly fell.

A group of teens shouted,
“WE LOVE YOU MUD QUEEN!!”

Lila closed her eyes.

“…Seattle is going to be a long weekend.”


---

Epilogue: Acceptance Part 2

That night, in Elena’s family home, Lila lay on the couch scrolling through her phone.

#MochaQueen
#TrainSpill
#MudQueenSeattle
#WhyDoesCoffeeLoveHer

All trending.

Laurie leaned over her shoulder.
“At least you’re famous?”

Lila groaned into a pillow.

Sophie cheerfully sipped a latte.
“Tomorrow we’re hitting a Starbucks Reserve. Wear something dark-colored.”

Lila lifted her head.

“…I’m scared.”

1p3nmxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1p3nmxn/can_i_file_claim_with_small_claim_tribunal_for/,can I file claim with small claim tribunal for shared expenses not paid by my travel mate from hell?,"Just got back from Japan with a travelmate from hell. Lets call her A. 

I used to play group tennis with A over 20 years ago when we were single. Never know her that well and lost touch for the last 20 years as we had kids but she chose to be kids free and enjoy her couple life and pursue her career. Met her in a wine event early this year and reconnected. Found out that her husband 'cheated' on her and she has been divorced for 2-3 years. She said she hardly vacation and has a lot of leaves to clear. I took pity on her and suggested taking a holiday together. 

Initially we planned to go to Jeju in early/mid Oct. But her Investment Committee meeting was postpone to late Oct so we have to postpone the trip to early Nov. As she is not a confident driver I suggested going to Japan instead, as we dont need to drive and can rely on HSR to get around. She said she is scared of cold and the only place in Japan she would go is Okinawa or Fukuoka.  So I choose Fukuoka as I reckon we still need to drive in Okinawa. She said SQ direct flight to Fukuoka at over $1k is too expensive. So we choose to fly via Shanghai, taking SQ return to SH and Air China return from SH to Fukuoka. This cost us $800 in total and we dont mind stopping over at SH to eat some hairy crabs and xiao long bao. 

After we booked the air tickets, red flags start to show. I did all the planning and hotel booking, which I dont mind. But when I asked her what she thinks of the itineraries, hotels, tours etc, she often never reply to my messages. I asked her to buy the JR rail pass 3-4 weeks before the trip so we can reserve seats on the scenic trains. Again, she ignored me. I asked her to meet up to discuss the trip, and she is always busy, attending corporate events with free food or ladies night with free drinks. 2 weeks before the trip, we finally met up, briefly, to decide on the hotels and itineraries. Few days later, she said there is a conference in Tokyo that she could attend right before our trip. The business class tickets will be fully paid by the external fund managers and she could earn all the krisflyer miles to keep her solitaire status, and stayed in 5 stars hotel. So she said she will not fly via SH with me but will meet me in Fukuoka. I was pretty shocked. How can she just ditched me after agreeing on the trip and bought the air tickets? She managed to get SQ to let her change her SG-SH return tickets if she paid a change fees due to her solitaire status, even though the tickets we bought were non cancellable, non changeable. She asked if I want to go for another holiday with her so she can change her air tickets. Of course I said NO. She was then told that the company cant pay for her return ticket from Fukuoka or Shanghai due to compliance issue. In the end, she gave up on her Tokyo business trip and said will go on the holiday as originally planned.

Then she revealed that she had issue with her travelmate to Greece in September. Her travelmate sleeps in 20C aircon and it is too cold for her. So she booked her own airbnb at last minute and was happy. Said we dont have to share rooms if I also sleep in 20C aircon room. I said I typically sleep in 23C, but it depends on the situation. Some old hotels the aircon may not be powerful enough and I may need lower temperature. Then she goes on to complaint about her Greece travelmate, C, saying she is a very poor trip planner. Another red flags.

First night while transit in SH, she said she doesnt sleep with aircon on. But as a 'compromise', we can turn on aircon at 24-25C. Guess what she wears to sleep? Sexy silky spaghetti strap dress. I asked her, if you are scared of cold, why dont you put on more clothes? I can understand if you still feel cold after fully dressed up, but you are underdressed!! She got angry and yelled at me. 'I cant sleep if I put on clothes. Not I dont want to. I only sleep in bra and underwear at home! ' Wow, how selfish one is? So do others have to sleep naked like her if it is too warm for them? Of course it is not in my culture to sleep naked, so I slept in shorts and t-shirts, without blanket for the night.

Day 2 after we checked into our hotel in Fukuoka. she asked the front desk what is there to do. With language barrier and without being specific, the front desk can only give very generic answers which is similar to the itineraries I have planned. She was disappointed and raised her voices and said 'nevermind, waste of time'.

Day 3 - we booked a klook day trip and supposed to meet at 745am. We agreed to leave the hotel at 715am to grab a coffee and breakfast before the meet up. At 705am, she is still not changed but decided to call the reception to find out how to use the illy coffee machine in the room. The phone is not very clear. Plus I guess the language barrier, they couldnt really answer her. She got upset, slammed the phone down and called again and then started yelling, 'can you hear me? I am asking how to use the coffee machine!!!' No answer. Then she slammed the phone down. I was terrified and felt sorry for the receptionist. So I told her, 'forget about the coffee machine. It is 710am. Get change and lets go grab coffee. Even if you figured out how to use the machine, the coffee would be too hot for you to drink.' Then, the door bell rang, the receptionist was so terrified, they ran to our room to show her how to use the coffee machine!! By the time the receptionist left, it is 715am. I said lets go! She got angry. She yelled at me and said she can drink very hot coffee. Asked me not to stress her. And if I cant wait, I can leave first. So I left. I was really really terrified, stress and upset at this point. What a monster am I travelling with, who cant stop yelling at people? This is not a holiday!!! 

Day 4 and day 5, even more drama. It is a 12 days trip. I really do not see how I can continue  travelling and sharing a room with her. I have travelled with many girl friends over the last 10 years. Never once did I have any issue with anyone. But with her? It is drama and screaming and yelling everyday. So I told her, why dont we split and go our own way? We have very different personality and travel style. It is too stressful to travel together. She refused. Said she has not done enough research to travel on her own (even though I have shared the itineraries with her, and being a well travelled SQ solitaire member). She said she has given up her all expense paid Tokyo business trip to travel with me. I have to complete the trip with her no matter how incompatible we are, or how unhappy the trip has turned out to be. I have to control my emotion and stick with her. I was so so so stress. It is like travelling with a time bomb, not knowing when she will explode. I do not know how to get rid of her so I thought I will get rid of myself and bought a new air ticket to return home, cutting the trip short. When I told her I am going home, she was furious. She started slamming everything in the room, including her luggage. She said I have no right to unilaterally cancel the trip and return home, leaving her alone. I was terrified for the night, texting my friend and said I dont know if she will go crazy and stab me in the middle of the night. 

The next day I left and felt relieved. She continued with her holiday. I asked her to pay back the money she owed me, 5 nights of shared hotels and the klook tour, minus some expenses she paid. The total is about SGD400. She refused. She said she has to scramble for hotels last minute, paying high prices. That my action has cost her monetary lost and I have to compensate her. She asked me to apologize to her and give her a discount off the money owed. I dont have strong ego and has no issue saying sorry. So I said SORRY. Then she asked 'how sincere is your apology? are you doing this just to get back your money?' I was like 'how do you want me to proof my sincerity? kowtow to you?' Then she said the damages I caused her is more than the discount I offered to her. 

I told her I should try to find her Greece travel mate C to compare notes and find out what hell she gave her. Then she finally revealed that her Greece trip had turned very ugly too, and said, 'lets say you are unlucky to come after her and I decided not to be sabotaged and bullied in silence anymore.'  wow, instead of doing a self reflection and asked why no one can travel with her or tahan her, she sees this as a form of bullying by 2 completely unrelated strangers in a span of 2 months.

Can I claim back the money owed through the small claim tribunals? I know it is not a lot of money and some may say it is not worth the effort. But I do not want her to get away with this. If I do nothing, she will only become worst in the future, thinking she can do anything she wants. She is a fund of funds manager, everyone kowtow to her. She even told me shamelessly that she once made fund managers who is buying her lunch at MBS wait for 40min as the carpark is full and she refused to pay for valet service. So she drove and park at nearby carpark and walked 15min back to MBS. That is why she is upset that I rushed her to leave the hotel on the dot instead of letting her enjoy her free illy coffee at the hotel. 5-10min late is no big deal. I am retired. So I have time to go through the process with her.

Hey y’all. I 24F was in a car accident three weeks ago. I didn’t black out or physically nearly die but I thought I was going to die. I was life flighted and everything and somehow walked away with only a few fractures in my pelvis/sacrum. I can still walk, I’m just on crutches right now. No one else was hurt in the accident. I remember the second the truck hit me, the car spinning, me screaming, and then the car stopping. The silence. Me thanking God I wasn’t dead. 

Yes, it was traumatic, but I don’t think I have PTSD from it. I’ve only had two dreams in the last 3 weeks about getting into another accident. I was nervous to get behind the wheel again for the first time but after driving again the first time I’ve been fine since. I did have a breakdown when I had to go back to the ER this week  (they initially said I had no fractures, I ended up in the ER because of pain and they did a repeat scan that revealed the three fractures and that’s when I got the crutches) and was crying hysterically to my mom because I was scared the doctor was going to call me a crybaby and say everything was fine. Heh. Fun times.

Anyway, onto the dreams.

Last night, I dreamt about a guy I went out with one time four years ago. But, for context, I was like obsessed with this guy. I met him because I worked with his dad. He was older than me and we talked a lot over a short period of time and eventually met up for coffee. Then he ghosted me. It was kind of my fault, I’m kind of a spaz when it comes to dating and I never know what to do or say. He was putting hints down and I just wasn’t picking them up. It is what it is. But it didn’t end on bad terms. A couple of months before he died, maybe 6, I ran into him at a CVS. We caught up for a second then went on our way. That was it. Then last year he died of a brain aneuyism. 

It was awful. I felt so bad for his parents and brother. I was upset too, but not abnormally I don’t think. I came home from work and shed a few tears thinking about him and the situation, said a prayer for him and his family, then went about my life. I hadn’t thought of him in ages until last night.

Last night, I dreamt about him. It’s hard to explain what happened in the dream but basically it was like what happened in real life- we almost/maybe could have gotten together and then we didn’t. Something stopped us from taking that final step. Just like in real life. He was trying to tell me something and I kept getting distracted and I never found out what he was trying to tell me in the dream.

So that on its own is one thing. Like aw, that’s sad, ok let’s move on. Well, then I had another dream tonight. This time about my uncle. My uncle passed away from stage 4 liver cancer two (three?) years ago. We were never really that close but we had a good relationship as far as our interactions we did have went. I was sad when he died, but mainly for my mom and my grandma who took care of him at home until he passed. When I was 12, my cousin who was the same age as me (who died when we were 20) gave me my first cigarette. I started smoking. When we were 12 or 13, my uncle gave us each a cigarette. Well what do you think happened in my dream? In my dream I was sleeping and my uncle woke me up, handed me a lit cigarette without saying a word, and walked away. I smoked the cigarette and then got up and I think I went to find him and couldn’t find him. I was afraid of him in my dream. 

But I was afraid of him in real life, too, when I was younger, not because he did anything bad or wrong to me, but because I was abused by a different male relative from the time I was 3/4 to 7 and that instilled a fear in me against most men so when I was growing up I didn’t go out of my way to really talk to or interact with my uncle.

I just think it’s really weird I dreamed about two separate dead people two nights in a row. I will say I’ve been having pretty vivid dreams since the accident. Most of the time hard to remember them but these ones stayed with me even after I woke up. I’ve been chalking the weird dreams off to Vicodin because I mainly have been taking it at night to help me sleep through the night due to my pain being worse at night and waking me up.

Once is an occurrence, twice could just be a coincidence… what if there’s a third time? Then what? I’m waiting for my cousin to show up in my dreams. I used to dream about her all the time after she died 5 years ago and haven’t in a while.

Has anybody had a similar experience or does anyone maybe know what my brain is trying to tell me? I’m agnostic but I’m open to the idea of a higher power/demonic influence trying to tell me something too. Is it because of the accident? I will say I did come out of the accident feeling like I got a second chance at things. I’ve definitely not lived the life I should have. And by that I just mean that I’ve always been pretty closed off. Never dated much. Never had a boyfriend. Always been so busy and focused on work. Don’t really have any hobbies. Constant identity crisis. Yes, I would probably benefit from therapy but I don’t have the time or money for it.

I did just start a new job a couple of months ago as well on top of everything else and I’ve been trying to navigate that too post-accident and it’s been rough and overwhelming. So could it be from stress?

I’m just at a loss and Google isn’t helping. Someone just tell me I’m not about to die or something because that would be so ridiculous to survive that kind of accident then die of something mundane or stupid a month later. But that would also be par for the course with my life lol

TIA!

1p3ni3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1p3ni3n/a_bright_future/,A bright future,"Mr. Kael’s transport pod slowed as it descended from the elevated thoroughfare, gliding through the residential sector. He kept his gaze fixed forward, but the periphery was unavoidable: rows upon rows of prefab houses, rust-streaked and huddled together, their tiny yards cluttered with synthetic tarps. *The ninety-half,* he thought, a familiar, sour taste in his mouth. The pod didn't stop, of course, without crossing the 25mph limit of the pot-riddled streets; it slipped seamlessly into the subterranean entrance of the Sector 7 Educational Compound.

The automated gates hissed, groaning shut, hesitantly, behind him and sealing him inside. The air down here was different, scrubbed, sterile, with the faint, metallic tang of ozone from the high-voltage security grid. He stepped out of the pod, swiped his card, and walked the sound-dampened ""Educator Spine,"" a gray, windowless corridor with chipped paint that ran parallel to, but never intersected with, the student-processing halls.

His room, Pod 3B, was at the end. He entered his side, the ""Control"" side, and the reinforced steel door sealed with a pneumatic sigh.

On the other side of the transparent armored glass, the students were filing in. Twenty-five faces, listless and gray under the flat, optimized-spectrum lighting.

Kael sat at his console and initiated the day's session. ""Good morning, class,"" he said into his microphone. His voice, digitized and flat, crackled from speakers above the students' heads.

He didn't need to look at his own screen; the lesson plan projected holographically over the students' desks. *Module 4: The Economic Necessity of Post-Industrial Compliance.* The content was generated by the Central AI, ""Edu-Core."" His only job was to be present, a human failsafe in a system that distrusted humans.

The AI began its monotone lecture. Kael's console was already active, showing him biometric readouts. Heart rates, attention levels, pupil dilation. Edu-Core handled the content, the delivery, and, most importantly, the grading.

Suddenly, a small red icon flashed on his console: **Student 112-F (Elara). Attention Level: 18% (Critical).**

Kael activated his microphone. The AI's lecture droned on, but his voice would cut through it only on her personal desk speaker. ""Student 112-F. Re-focus.""

Through the glass, he saw her jolt. Her head, which had been angled down, snapped up.

""A poor grade is a poor future, Elara,"" he said, his voice flat.

She nodded quickly, eyes fixed on the hologram. Kael watched her hands. Just before she jolted, her left hand had been under her desk. He saw it slide back into view, moving slowly. As she straightened, her right hand covertly pushed a small, tattered block, a physical book, *Of Mice and Men*, deeper into her bag. A futile, rebellious gesture. He noted it, but didn't log it. Edu-Core would handle the inevitable low score.

His gaze lingered on her for a second before returning to his console. His own small act of defiance was taped to the console's underside, well below the sightline of the glass and the overhead inspection cameras.

He brushed his finger against it. It was a small, flimsy square of real photographic paper, faded and creased. A woman with dark hair, laughing under a tree that was undeniably real.

To Edu-Core, this wasn't just paper. It was ""Bio-Emotional Contraband."" History before the Great Standardization was forbidden because it was dangerous. It proved that the world hadn't always been gray, that laughter hadn't always been scheduled. Possession wasn't just a crime; it was a symptom of mental defect, punishable by immediate formatting.

He hadn't looked at it directly in months, but knowing it was there, a bomb of color in a monochrome world was the only thing keeping him sane.

He was halfway through his mandated lukewarm coffee when the disruption began.

It started, as it always did, in the back. Student 117-B (Jared) and Student 204-D (Rilo). A whispered accusation, a shove. A desk unit, bolted to the floor, rattled. Then 117-B lunged, his fists connecting with 204-D's face. Blood, shocking, bright and red against the gray scrubs, splattered onto the floor.

The other students didn't scatter. They leaned in. For the first time all morning, their eyes weren't glazed; they were hungry.

Kael’s hand hovered over the red button under the plastic guard. **He didn't press it.** Not yet.

His heart hammered against his ribs, a traitorous rhythm. He watched the violence, mesmerized. It was messy, inefficient, and chaotic. It was the most human thing he had seen in years. *Let them feel it,* he thought, a dangerous spike of adrenaline hitting his blood. *Just for five seconds. Let them feel alive.*

The logic processors on his screen flashed: **DISTURBANCE DETECTED. INITIATE PACIFICATION.**

He waited one second. Two. Jared landed another punch. A girl screamed, a real, ragged sound.

Kael’s finger trembled. If he waited too long, Edu-Core would flag *him*. With a heavy sigh of resignation, he crushed the button.

A sharp hiss filled the student pod. Vents in the ceiling released a fine, white mist. It wasn't tear gas; it was ""Stasis-Mist,"" a fast-acting calmative. The fight dissolved instantly. The two boys, caught mid-punch, stumbled. They coughed, their limbs grew heavy, and they sank to the floor, drowsy and confused. The hunger in the other students' eyes vanished, replaced by the familiar, drug-induced glaze.

Kael felt a wave of nausea. He had just suffocated the only spark of life in the room.

A moment later, the student-side door opened. A ""Pacification Unit"" glided in. It was a seven-foot-tall chrome automaton, all smooth lines and hydraulic power. Its optical sensor, a single red bar, swept the room. It located the ""perturbators,"" extended two pincer-like appendages, and efficiently clamped onto their arms.

It dragged the two dazed students out of the room. The door hissed shut behind them.

Kael knew the protocol. The boys would be processed at the local precinct. Their biometrics and the incident recording, already filed by Edu-Core, would be enough. They were bound for a Reformation Camp. They wouldn't be back.

The AI lesson, which had paused, resumed. ""...compliance is the key to societal harmony...""

An hour later, a chime sounded on Kael's console. Edu-Core had finished grading the mid-module assessment. A new list populated on his screen, forwarded from the central server.

**Mandatory Vocational Assignment.**

Kael activated his microphone again. His throat felt like sandpaper. ""The following students will report to Manual Labor Bay 4 at the conclusion of this session. 401-A, 338-C...""

He reached the name he dreaded. He paused, the silence stretching just long enough to be a glitch. 112-F was the next. He kept silent.

Elara stood up. She didn't look at the floor. She looked straight at the glass. Straight at *him*.

She knew. She knew he had seen the book earlier. She knew he had delayed the button.

Kael stared back, paralyzed. He wanted to say something, *Run, Hide*, but the audio channel was monitored. He could only watch.

Elara slowly reached into her bag. She didn't take out the book. She simply touched the hidden shape of it through the fabric, a protective gesture, maintaining eye contact with him. A silent challenge. *I still have it. You didn't report me.*

""Session dismissed,"" Kael whispered, though his microphone was already off.

She turned and joined the gray line. As the heavy steel door hissed shut behind the last student, the room fell into absolute, terrified silence.

Kael looked down at his console. Under the console, his finger found the edge of his hidden photograph. He ripped the tape loose.

He didn't look at the smiling woman. He placed the photo on top of the console, right in the open, directly under the glaring red eye of the inspection camera.

He leaned back in his chair, crossed his hands behind his head, and waited.

And after one boring hour waiting for martyrdom, he decided to go back home.

1p3nexl,https://i.redd.it/ndal3pcpir2g1.jpeg,It Took Me 30 Years to Understand that Verbal Kint is *not* Keyser Soze in “The Usual Suspects”,"The Usual Suspects is arguably one of the greatest films of all time. And it has one of the greatest plot twists of all time. And it worked on a lot of people for 30 years, myself included. Verbal Kint has just walked out of Dave Kujan’s office after two hours of intense interrogating. Kujan knows that a lot of people are dead and Kint is the only survivor. Kint claims it’s the mythical crime lord Keyser Soze, a criminal boogeyman, who was behind it all. Kujan isn’t buying it, he claims that the person responsible is fellow heister Dean Keaton, there is no Keyser Soze and that Keaton got the poor crippled Kint to claim it was Soze to cover for him. Unfortunately for Kujan the bail goes through and Kint walks. But as Kint is leaving the building, Kujan looks at his partner’s bulletin board and sees that Kint Kujan looks at his partner's bulletin board and sees that, the entire time that Kint has been there, he has been making things up about what happened based on things he saw on the bulletin board. And not only that, one of the survivors of the crime claims that there was another party on that boat when it all went down, Keyser Soze. He describes to a sketch artist who he saw and who he believes to be Keyser Soze and as Kujan is running after Kint to find out what just happened. A fax comes through with the sketch, the man in the sketch looks exactly like Verbal Kint. Implying that Kint is Keyser Soze.

And for decades that was the narrative to be believed by anyone watching it. Something I believed. But upon rewatching, something just didn’t sit right with me. If Kint is Keyser Soze then why turn himself in? If Soze staged everything from the beginning what was the point of the first two heists, why didn’t he just approach these guys when they were in the cell instead of somehow waiting. And If Kobayashi isn’t real then who was the man in the car with Kint at the end. I lost sleep over this. I was thinking how could writer Christopher McQuarrie be so sloppy with this character errors?  How can one of the greatest films of all time have such extreme oversights? 
Why are there so many inconsistencies in what Verbal tells Kujan and the real crime at stake. And like Dave Kujan dropping his coffee cup, I metaphorically did the same. It all made sense, Every flashback clip and every sound bite at the end revelation, all of that made sense once I pieced together my theory.

Verbal Kint is not Keyser Soze. But if he’s not Soze, is Soze even real? And if so, who is he? 

Here are the facts.
- Everything in the beginning scene is true 
- Kint is a con man with a fake disability
- There was a boat with no dope, untouched cash, and 50 men dead. Including McManus, Hockney, Keaton and the Hungarian witness who can positively identify a man who is said to be Keyser Soze
- There was a police line up which rounded up the 5 main guys on the job. Every guy on the job is real. We know this because Kujan personally brought Keaton in, which means he would’ve known everyone involved on the initial crime that put them in the lineup. Or some idea at least
- Every time Kint tells a lie he is looking right at the bulletin board. There is no “Kobayashi” and no “Redfoot.” Which means that any scene with them is likely made up or the names of the real individuals were changed by Verbal
- Kint is not a rat

So from using just that, you could just about say most of what we see from Verbal’s testimony is true. But based on a few key points of contention, Kint is not Soze. The biggest evidence is that Kujan had his wrap sheet, confirming he’s been busted before. As Kint said himself, “You think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught and sticks his head out?” These are not the actions of a man like Soze, but these are the actions of a man like Verbal Kint. So who is Verbal Kint? 

Ok hear me out. Kint was a scam artist playing a disabled character telling what is a partially made up story to the police. So having said that, from this point on I’ll differentiate the two identities as Kint when he’s really Kint and Verbal when he’s actively trying to scam someone. And Kint loves being able to use Verbal to trick people and slip out of sticky situations. 

So Kint very likely did use Verbal to scam someone that was connected to Soze and somehow used his tricks to get away scot-free. Whether or not Soze came after him personally is debatable. But knowing he got away with it, still alive, changed him. He then turned into a Christopher Nolan Joker, head full of delusion, hitting the big bosses to send a message to Soze that there’s a new kid on the block. This is probably when he still thought Soze was a myth.

So I believe the initial lineup to be real, even Kint’s fake limp. Meanwhile as this is happening on screen, behind the scenes Kint is well on his way to finding out all of Soze’s enterprises. So, while locked up, it was Kint, not McManus, using his Verbal skills to let the others know that he has a job he’s got brewing, to hit the finest taxi service. 
I believe that the other guys, minus Keaton, didn’t know who he was. I believe Keaton does know who he is and explains to the others that he fakes it. Keaton even said he did time with Kint, and there’s no way Kint would’ve been Verbal (fake limping) for 5 years while in the joint. This part is actually up for debate because it’s not confirmed that they knew each other prior the exterior scenes. But I’d be more inclined to believe they did on the sole basis that the guys all knew each other except for Kint. And it would take at least Keaton as a middle man to convince them to do the job. Little do they know is that Kint is not telling them something. I think he found out Soze ran the corrupt cop service and he wanted to get national attention, specifically Soze’s. So when you see Keaton throwing Kint around in the next scene the dialogue would probably be almost identical to how it played in the movie, except Kint probably wasn’t pathetic Verbal, hell Kint probably roughed up Keaton rather than the other way around, but that’s an extreme “what if”. The only difference is that Kint probably needed Keaton to not only convince the other three but also join himself. That’s why I think Keaton was probably the one that says “no killing” which makes more sense coming from Keaton rather than Kint, considering his fear that these crimes may come back to haunt him. Armed robbery is one thing, but a murder complicates matters, especially if he expects to go straight if they get away with it. 

The heist happens exactly as it does in the movie. But the interesting thing that I noticed re watching the scene is that, aside from the first scene with Redfoot, every time Kint is seen wearing his sunglasses he seems very uncharacteristic to the rest of his performance in the story. He’s not limping as much, he’s less socially awkward, he even smokes differently. This is Kint, not Verbal, in his natural state. Case in point when he shoots the guy in the second heist, something completely bizarre to see when you first watch and can be attributed by the audience to be foreshadowing to the twist that he’s Soze. I’m more into the idea that every scene when he wears his glasses, these are things that really happened. The Redfoot scene is tricky, my best guess is that it was Kint, not Redfoot, asking the guys for another job, because he wasn’t done letting Soze know he meant business. You might be thinking “plot hole because he wore his glasses during the Kobayashi and Edie Finneran scene.” Well this is where where it gets interesting. So brace yourself.

Kint turns from con man to killer during the second job. He realises that they won’t get away with it if the guy refuses to hand over the case, so before Keaton tells him one more time to let go, Kint shoot him dead. Couple that with the sunglasses theory, and you see him not only have perfect aim but you get that lingering shot of him looking like he’s in shock after killing him. This is probably his first murder. It was also a look of someone who signed his own death warrant with Soze.

Soze does find out, however, and he also finds out about Kint. Soze confronts Kint about it and I believe that Kint tells him everything. In fact, I think that Kint’s entire narration at the beginning was him talking to Soze, not the police. I mean think about it, the way he described the cops in his recollection was very unflattering, something that would boil their blood if he told them. Soze admires his backbone trying to steal from him twice, knowing who he was stealing from. Soze knew he was good at what he did trying to convince people of stories that might not be true, probably even fibbing a little to Soze himself when he shakes him down.

I do not believe the other four ripped off Soze in the past. Moreso that when Kint was describing the men in the “testimony”, he was actually offering them up to Soze. He probably made a deal with him that he can offer four guys to work for him. This intrigues Soze enough to put him in charge of a secret mission that requires killing the four other guys once it’s over (again, Joker). But Soze also wanted Kint to turn himself in and give the police a statement, the same one he gives Kujan, minus Soze initially. So when Kujan comes into the room asking Kint who Keyser Soze is, Kint says “oh fuck!” When we first watch it we’re inclined to believe Kint is annoyed they found out about Soze, further endangering him. The “Kint is Soze” theory makes us think he’s been found out as Soze and he has to lie to cover his tracks. According to my theory, it’s a bit of both. Kint realises Kujan knows the existence of Soze so he’s swearing to himself, thinking not only can he deny Soze now, but that gives him a lot more work to do to make things up, while also trying to give an honest statement with Kujan so he doesn’t get held for longer and aggravating Soze.

I doubt this would’ve been a problem for Soze, knowing that Verbal would probably just improvise. Soze is smart and knows that people don’t think he’s real, that’s why he’s so good at sneaking around.

So back to what we know. The second Redfoot scene was probably once again the guys fighting with Kint about another job, he tells them about Soze’s lawyer which, for the sake of simplicity, I’ll differentiate as Story Kobayashi and Real Kobayashi. Now remember, there was never a real Kobayashi, at least what we see in Verbal’s story. The character wouldn’t make sense in the slightest. If Soze was that big on never working with the same people twice, why would he trust Kobayashi so many times? I think the myth regarding Soze not re using the same people might’ve just been something Verbal added for dramatic effect and I will assume that various Soze underlings filled in for the role of Story Kobayashi.

So Kint explains to them (while leaving out the part of his own personal agenda) that Soze wants them to do a job. Upon hearing this, the guys receive their collateral packages most likely given by Kint (including one for himself) Kint tries to reason with him that Soze has them by the balls, maybe even lets his Verbal slip out by saying how he’s stupid and in too deep. They don’t punish him but instead decide to ignore Soze’s demands. Later Verbal probably talks to all of them individually, trying to see if they’re all on board. But then has a lot of traction with it with Fenster. Overcome with anger and fear, Kint kills Fenster. The reason I say it’s Kint is because the way Fenster is killed is done in the exact same way that everyone else who dies by Kint’s hand will suffer. Two shots. I feel that Kint may not have killed Fenster on the first shot and he had to finish the job with another, causing him to become paranoid about not getting it right on the first if he has to kill more people. What I noticed was that Hockney always aims his gun to the side. Kint no doubt asked him why he does it and Hockney tells him it is much more effective.
So rather than it be a trademark of Soze, it is merely a compulsion for Kint to aim his gun sideways and shoot twice with everyone else from this point forward. 

So he kills Fenster and likely leads the others down to beach to see it. Verbal of course blames it on Soze (because he just  can’t help himself) as a message for the others to not mess with him. It’s the only logical conclusion as to why “Soze” would kill him, despite needing five people for the job. 

Soze finds out and is furious but Kint assures him he can double their efforts with only four people while also justifying that he provided the other guys a sacrificial lamb to help motivate them. This backfires when they plan to kill Soze’s lawyer. Kint tells Soze this and Soze tells him to let them proceed with it provided he knows about the “when and where” it will happen. Soze, however, doesn’t tell Kint about the fact that Edie is involved in it, leading him to look surprised when Story Kobayashi tells them. He’s hearing it for the first time, not only to motivate Keaton but to remind Verbal that innocents are involved. I’m not sure if the real lawyer went into great detail about the punishment that would be involved with the other two guys or if this was enough to spook them into submission.

So when the job finally happens, Kint is told that because he’s the closest man to Soze that’s still alive, he has to let the other guys believe it’s a dope job. So he tells Kint that Kint not only has to finish off the other guys but has to kill off the witness that can testify against Soze, Arturo Marquez. Soze thinks that the one test of loyalty Kint can pass to prove he’s not a threat is by killing the Marquez. So when they get on the boat, Kint does his thing minus the limp. In fact, every time there’s a reaction shot of Kint freezing up in Verbal’s story, I’d wager that this is probably just told by Verbal to Kujan about what he did, instead of actually showing it. This lends more credence to the fact that the four other guys knew he wasn’t a cripple, because if he was Soze he’d look pretty silly to his enemies and be massively ineffective to the other guys if he’s going around ruthlessly killing men one minute and then going back to his Verbal persona when one of the other guys is looking (I know, it’s layers upon layers, but that’s what makes this film so fun). So when Kint goes wild and shoots everyone, the burned witness in the hospital no doubt sees this and believes it to be Soze. Killing everyone with that sideways aim and two shot kills that he’s now known for. 
Meanwhile, Kint for one night, relishes in the fact that if he’s a man that represents Soze, why can’t he be Soze? Just until everyone is dead. So when Verbal tells Kujan he thought about how Fenster looked when they buried him what Kint is really saying is he thought about how Fenster looked when he killed him. And when he said he “actually thought Keaton could pull it off,” he’s actually referring to himself, still somehow successfully getting away with killing all the people and coming out of it unharmed. So when he kills Marquez, all he has to do now is finish off who’s left. So, with a bout of blood thirsty mania, he dons the overcoat and hat in Marquez’s room and goes after McManus and Keaton.
He kills McManus with a knife because they probably came into close contact with each other at some point, McManus wonders why Kint is dressed the way he is. Kint, after spending six weeks with this homoerotic loose canon, decides he’s going to make his death more personal. They probably get into a tussle and Kint stabs him in the back. McManus walks out saying “the strangest thing” meaning he couldn’t believe Kint betrayed them, before dying. Kint then shoots Keaton and as he lays dying, he calls him “Keyser.” He doesn’t say it because he’s the real Soze but more as a joke between them, the hat and the overcoat, Keaton finds great amusement in the idea that Kint is pretending to be Soze, even though he knows that they’re the only two on the boat at this point. Keaton doesn’t think Kint is Soze, due to knowing him for five years in jail. So, it’s a joke and harmless jab at Kint for still trying to be Soze and “make like (he) was notorious.” 

So we get to end of the story that Verbal is telling Kujan. Kujan doesn’t buy it. Kujan starts shouting at Kint that it is secretly Keaton and for a brief moment, there is a shot where Kint stops, hesitates, let’s Kujan accuse Keaton, and runs with it. Truely fascinated that his “the greatest trick the devil ever pulls is convincing the world he doesn’t exist” quote is actually taking effect before his very eyes. But then he remembers that if he is so ready to agree with Kujan that it’s Keaton, Kujan will make good on all the threats that he hurled at Kint throughout the story, so he plays up his Verbal character a little more so as not to arouse suspicion, before eventually pretending to confess that Keaton was behind it. 

Then Kint leaves, drops the Verbal act, and waits for the man who looks a lot like Story Kobayashi to pick him up. They exchange looks before driving off into the sunset.  What Kint doesn’t account for is that there was a witness who places Kint to the scene and who claims it’s Soze. But that doesn’t really matter because Kint’s fate would probably go one of two ways. Kint is either paid by Soze to lay low while Soze himself finishes off the burned witness with ease, knowing that the witness thinks Kint is Soze, Soze could easily disguise himself as a doctor and finish the job.
Or he would allow Kujan to spend years trying to build up a case that Kint is Soze without any success at all, completing the adage “a rumor is not a rumor that doesn’t die.”

The only thing that stumps me is the killing of Edie Finneran. Yes her death was necessary, to Soze at least, to tie up loose ends, but why? A part of me thinks that Soze killed her in the same way Kint does it, potentially as an insurance trap to make sure Kint is going to do as Soze says, while secretly setting up a contingency plan to ensure that if something goes wrong, he can potentially frame Kint for all of it. But another part of me thinks that Edie isn’t dead, and Agent Kujan was just lying to Kint, trying to scare him into confessing to him that Keaton is his man. I’m just going to chalk it up as a character error on the writer’s part, but if anyone else has thoughts about it let me know. 

I don’t think Soze kills Kint seeing as he could’ve easily done it between when the job happened and when Verbal is brought in to testify. Soze knew that Kint wasn’t so readily to go to the police when all the stuff went down, unlike Arturo Marquez who has had a long history of testifying against criminals. That’s why Soze and his lawyer strike a deal with the police granting him immunity. Kint is a good liar, a good thief and judging by his recent body count, a good killer. So it would be considered by Soze to be foolish to kill Kint if one day Soze returns to ask him for a favour. 

So who is the real Keyser Soze? Definitely not Kint, probably not Keaton and extremely unlikely to be the man that Verbal tells the story of in the interrogation office. I’ll say that’s likely a myth Verbal came up with just to stroke Kint’s own creative ego and distract Kujan. If anyone else wants to believe that this is true, then why not. 
No, the real Keyser Soze is Story Kobayashi of course. Meaning that if we look at it from a meta perspective, not only we were looking at Soze the whole time, when you see this theory and re watch it you notice that that the real Soze is actually Story Kobayashi and what we thought was the real Soze in Kint is actually Kint becoming the Real Kobayashi. The roles have reversed.

This is why there’s an odd look from each other when they get into the car. I was too busy wrapped up with the fact that this man, in some way, exists that I never noticed that they give each other this look. An “is it done?” sort of look. So they drive off, leaving Kujan to pick up the pieces. 

So there you have it. The twist isn’t that Kint is Soze. The twist is that “Verbal” doesn’t exist, only Kint. And Kint’s whole narrative arc began as a lowlife con man turned killer turned protected close associate to Soze himself. Kint becomes the Real Kobayashi.

And those are my thoughts. ",1,1763797225.0,u_ChristophBartlett,0,1.0,False
1p3ndeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/1p3ndeh/feeling_wired_247_on_test_e_anyone_experienced/,Feeling wired 24/7 on Test E — anyone experienced this?,"I’ve been taking 50 mg Test E every 3 days for about 2 weeks now.

Before that, I was taking 100 mg every 5 days, but I kept getting intense overstimulation — basically a fight-or-flight reaction starting 6–12 hours after each injection. The day after, I’d feel very pessimistic, irritable, and mentally “on edge.” It only got better the further I got from the shot.

For context, on 100 mg e5d my labs were:
	•	Total T: ~1000 ng/dl
	•	E2: 57
	•	SHBG: 20

Since switching to the new injection pattern, I’m still struggling. I feel wired all day and night.
I’m only sleeping 3–4 hours in total, and the sleep is broken. I fall asleep for 1–2 hours, wake up feeling extremely overstimulated (almost like I drank way too much coffee), and then it takes an hour or more to fall asleep again. This repeats throughout the night.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? What helped?

Could daily injections make things more stable?

1p3ncz2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3ncz2,Prada White Sweater,"Perhaps one of my favourite brands is Prada. Its clothing is quite minimal and elegant. It’s a company that truly has a sophisticated character. I’ve bought several Prada replicas, but this time I want to try a white sweater. You can match it with everything, and white is my favourite colour. So I decided this time to try a new seller, LuxuryKeeper.

 

**Communication with the Seller**

Communication with the seller was pleasant. You can easily find LuxuryKeeper on WhatsApp, where he is active every day and won’t leave any of your questions unanswered. He helps you a lot in choosing the right size. Unfortunately, he doesn’t send QC photos himself, but leaves that process to the agent — something you also see with even the more experienced sellers.

⭐️ **Rating: 1/1**

 

**Shipping Method & Packaging**

The package arrived promptly to the agent, even earlier than I expected. The packaging was perfect and there were no issues upon its receipt. It even arrived in my hands in excellent condition.

⭐️ **Rating: 1/1**

 

**Construction Quality** **& Fit**

It’s a minimal piece without too many details, but the moment you hold the sweater in your hands you realise it’s a solid, well-made item. You won’t find any faulty stitching or loose threads. Even the logo on the neck is perfectly placed, and the tags are stitched and cut impeccably. It has a slightly rough texture, but it’s a 100% cotton product of very good quality. The ribbing on the sleeves, the neck, and the waist also appears reliable. I hope it won’t stretch out with washing, and I also hope that the logo on the neck won’t rust after washing. However, I can say that I am absolutely satisfied.

As for the sizing, I should clarify that this is a true-to-size sweater. The measurements are European, and you receive exactly what you order. I chose the XL, but if I had known better, I would have gone with the L.

⭐️ **Rating: 1/1**

**Design Fidelity**

It’s a “ready-to-wear” piece that I couldn’t find on Prada’s website to make direct comparisons, but from various photos online of similar Prada products, it looks quite convincing. It’s somewhat loose-fit. The logo is of very good quality, unlike others of lower quality. However, I would also like your opinion on this. Personally, I don’t think anyone will come that close to my neckline to inspect the details. The tags are also very convincing, although the one on the back of the neck appeared black on the website before I bought it, and to be honest, it looked more high-quality. Still, it’s stitched only on the top side in a particular way, giving it a premium aesthetic.

Finally, I’d like to remind you that it’s not exactly a pure white sweater. I’d say it’s more of a “milky white” product. I can say I received exactly what I expected.

⭐️ **Rating: 0.8/1**

 

**Value for Money**

And now we come to the eternal question: was it worth the cost or not? My answer is yes, if you’re looking for something for everyday use. If you want something with style that you can wear for coffee, for a drink, or for your walk around the city. It’s not the kind of sweater you’d wear to impress in an expensive restaurant or among wealthy circles. It’s a streetwear piece — a sweater you’ll choose for daily use and one you can combine with anything you want. At a cost of around 30 euros, you really can’t go wrong if you like the style.

⭐️ **Rating: 0.8/1**

**Overall Rating: 4.6/5**

 

**LuxuryKeeper caught my attention quite a lot with his album. He passed the first test for me, and I will definitely buy something from him again. I’ve already set my eyes on a pair of YSL shoes, and I think we’ll soon see another review from him. It’s worth taking a look, as I saw things he offers that other sellers don’t, and his prices are quite competitive.**

noong bago bago pa lang siya nanliligaw, he never failed to surprise me with foods and/or coffee pagkauwi ko from duty. tapos there’s this one time na he went lang sa apt js to hand me the tulips he bought while i was asleep. he was ok naman overall, kahit nung naging kami na. but my issues sa kaniya started when he went through my spare phone and ipad when i left it sa kanila. he didn’t tell me kaagad na he browsed everything—my notes, messenger, ig and even my private account sa tiktok na ako lang may alam. he began acting weird non, kept comparing yung sarili niya sa mga past flings ko whenever i decline him kapag nagaaya mag s-word. basta the typical sad boy moves ba? that’s when he started to give me an ick, na kahit i-assure ko siya, parang ayaw niya maniwala. hell, he doesn’t even trust me at all (based daw sa mga nakita niyang videos ko during my party girl era. single ako non, fyi). we talked abt it, tapos things went back to normal so i disregarded it. 

fast forward to when i moved to manila na for my review. it got WORSE. he kept asking me all the time sino kasama ko, where ako pupunta, anong ginagawa ko. when i have already told him na kung sino, AND mind you, i have no friends sa review center non kase ik na he’d be jealous af kahit na gusto kong makipag kaibigan (he alr asked me na kasi before n i-cut off yung guy best friend ko js because he didn’t like him chatting me 😭 IT WAS ABT SCHOOL WDYM). i keep disregarding lang everything kasi nga i have to focus sa review ko, and i don’t want him to be the reason why i won’t pass the board exam. he’s even demanding me to punta sa kanila or we go check in js so we can s-word, e ako i’m so so so tired emotionally, mentally and physically gawa nga ng review tapos i have no one pa to talk to or to study with, afraid na magalit siya kapag nakipag kaibigan ako. oh, idagdag pa na there was a problem sa family at that time kaya i really don’t know na anong gagawin ko. all i want sa kaniya is to be there, na maging pahinga ko siya after everything. kaso what’s happening is, nakakadagdag pa siya 😭 

a month before my board exam, i made new friends fr different univ sa review center. AND THAT’S THE ONLY TIME NA I FELT HAPPY, i felt alive!! kaso nagkaroon na naman ng issue, he doesn’t want me to be friends with them!!! hahaha tangina! he became more and more needy each day na lumipas. the day before my board exam, nag away kami! he said nga na he doesn’t even trust me at all. gusto kong sumabog, gusto kong mag back out! but i said, bahala siya if that’s what he thinks of me. kasi i still have a dream to pursue (ive always been a career over love girly).

then here comes the time na pinapauwi na ako sa sibling ko kase the board exam was done, after party was done. i have no other businesses left na sa manila. he still does that, he still asks me sinong kalaro ko sa valorant every single time na i update him na i’m gna play with friends. para akong nasasakal kasi why do i feel like i’m being manipulated, na parang lahat ng gawin ko need ko ng permission from him? na lahat ng kaibiganin ko, need munang dumaan sa kaniya? i feel so little. ‘yung physical appearance ko ngayon, halatang mataas cortisol level ko. the glow’s no longer there. dati kahit hindi ako mag makeup, ok na, pero ngayon hindi e. i feel so ugly and stressed. akala ko after my board exam, magiging ok na e. mawawala na stress ko. kaso hindi pa pala e. i don’t know what to do anymore. i love him so much, hindi ko na alam.

1p3nc2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p3nc2h/wibta_for_reaching_out_to_twin_a_even_though_twin/,WIBTA for reaching out to Twin A even though Twin B rejected me a year ago?”,"I (21M) used to go to school with two twin sisters a couple years ago, Twin A and Twin B. We were all classmates for about 3 years.

Back then I was super quiet, shy, and honestly not confident at all.

I always liked Twin A first. She was sweet, calm, had this smile that would literally make my whole day. Nothing big happened though, I never had the guts to ask her out.

Fast forward to last year (2024):
I ended up reaching out to Twin B instead, not because she was my first choice, but because at the time she was the one still in my life. Twin A, left our school. I thought maybe something could happen. I sent her a message asking if she’d be interested in grabbing coffee.

She turned me down politely.
She was really kind about it, said she was focusing on her med school applications and wished me the best. No drama. Just a clean, respectful rejection.

Now here’s where I’m stuck:

It’s been almost a year since I asked Twin B out.
I haven’t seen Twin A in almost two years.
I’ve worked on myself a lot since then, confidence, life stability, routine, everything.

And I still think about her.

Not in a weird obsessive way, just… she left a mark on me. She genuinely inspired me to improve my life. And part of me regrets not asking her out when we were all in school together.

So here’s my dilemma:

Is it wrong or weird to reach out to Twin A a year after Twin B rejected me?

Some people online say “never date siblings,” some say it doesn’t matter because nothing happened between me and Twin B at all. No flirting or nothing, just warm friendly interactions. I literally only asked her out once. It wasn’t a crush, a fling, nothing.

But I don’t want Twin A to feel like a second choice, because she wasn’t. She was the one I liked originally, I was just too shy back then.

If I reached out is that disrespectful? Or is it normal since Twin B and I never dated or went beyond a single coffee invite?

So im extremely stressed out about my Ip(a). I went through a month long period of intense anxiety attacks to where my body was tense everything was out of whack. Im much calmer after some time went by, but it was not fun... I can't get to my PCP until January.
I know some of my markers are good. Some need work. Ip(a) is scary and trying to not think of myself as a ticking time bomb... 

Im 31M, have lost about 60 pounds (from 220 lbs to just under 160lbs) over the last 2 years from 80% healthy diet, and moderate excerise. I lift weights, pushs ups, sit ups, squats every two days at home. My diet Monday through Thursday is (I work 6 am-430pm) Morning - black coffee, lunch- eggs, salmon, seasoned chicken breast. Dinner - rice and either cooked seasoned ground beef/ground turkey/chicken along with peppers onions chickpeas/black beans. Then after dinner ill have ""deserts"" which are blueberries, blackberries, yogurt (sometimes with granola), and either coconut milk or almond milk. Weekends ill relax on the diet a bit. Sometimes get a burrito from Chipotle, or a pizza etc.
Realistically, how much of a risk am I? Am I going to drop dead at 50 from this? All I hear is how dangerous it is and its genetic (my dad is almost 70, heavy smoker, drinks, eats like crap) and doesn't have heart issues. He isnt overweight though and is on cholesterol meds. So it confuses me.
Im looking for realistic input/advice but would also be nice to know if its going to kill me by 50 or not... Maybe the anxiety will before then...

Also a bit more info. I take AG1 monday-thursday along with extra strength fish oil, vitamins d3 k2, C, l theanone, and sometimes ashwaghanda for anxiety relief. Is CoQ10 and Berberine worth looking into? Or is statins the only answer here? 

I make protein smoothies after dinner/workouts few times a week with protein mixes, frozen blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, acai, cinnamon, almond milk, creatine, psyllium husk, grinder chia/flax/hemp seeds. 

Also how critical is saturated fats in this situation? I eat steak twice a month, and drink coconut milk. Can I? ",2,1763796816.0,PeterAttia,0,1.0,False

So, after trying all these, finally decided to try out brewing my own coffee. I don't have time to go into sophisticated apparatus and contraptions so I got a Channi grind from Third wave coffee.

Recipe: 
1. Boil 80ml filtered water till it vigorously bubbles.
2. Turn off the heat and cool it down till 95°C
3. Add 1 large tablespoon of coffee grounds to the water, and a pinch of salt.
4. Cover with a lid and and let it brew for 4-5 mins.
5. Strain it with a S.S strainer with minimal agitation to ensure less turbidity.

Thoughts:
It tastes like ""bean soup"". I don't know how else to describe it. It's chocolatey,burnt, and a hint of bitterness. 
I don't know if it's the method I'm using or something wrong with the beans.

I usually use 97°C water for light roasts. 

With the Switch I'm not getting overwhelmingly better brews. One thing I noticed is the coffee is noticably hotter. I also find theres no pronounced acidity or sweetness and at times the coffee feels like aromatic hot water. I even let it cool down still taste is quite muted as compared to V60 or Kalita Wave. I used the Coffee Chronicler 50:50 recipe and a Timemore C3 grinder. Using Hario filters that come with the Switch.

My questions are

Do I need to grind coarser or finer as compared to a V60? I think intuitively I should go coarser but read on one of the subs that it should actually be finer.

Most recipes recommend 93°C water. I get good results at 97 for regular pourover. Should I go colder?

Now I feel I should get a  grinder because while pre-grounded has worked alright for me, I can’t have coffee options as I have to consume a pack within a week or so. 

I only use Aeropress to brew my coffee and don’t think I’ll switch to any other method any soon. 

I have been looking at these options :
1. Timemore chestnut C3S
2. Q-Air
3. Kingrinder K6

I worked for almost 2 years at a franchised corporate coffee shop chain. While many of us took pride in what we did, at the end of the day, we had automatic shot pullers. This means I don’t traditionally know how to make coffee, beyond tinkering around at home with a bit of a passion.

My query: I’m onboarding for a new opportunity at a unionized *bucks (asterisked because I don’t know the rules on that, and I did look for them, unsuccessfully) and while I’m almost sure the espresso machines will be automated, I’m completely unfamiliar with working for this “franchise” if I can even call it that? Does anyone have any helpful tips or other subreddits better suited for me to ask in? I wasn’t sure if their main subreddit was corporate only, or how it even works. 

My goal: always was to work in a real coffee shop, I’m just not qualified as I’ve applied religiously for years. Thanks for reading if you did 💕",1,1763796248.0,barista,1,1.0,False

But what happens when those secrets don't want to stay locked up anymore? What happens when they start to whisper in the dark? My name's Leo. I was just a guy trying to make ends meet, jobless and running out of options. I took this job looking for a paycheck. I had no idea I was about to find a nightmare.""

In the fall of 2018, I became the lone night watchman at ""Secure-U-Store,"" a sprawling concrete labyrinth on the forgotten edge of Dayton, Ohio. My duties were simple: two walking patrols of the entire compound—one at midnight, one at 4 a.m. There were no cameras. It was just me and the cold, indifferent beam of my flashlight against the night.

My first night was like a blank canvas. Silent, peaceful. I did both my patrols. Aside from the whistle of the wind, there wasn't a single sound out of place. I sat in the guard shack, watching the distant city lights, and I actually thought to myself how beautiful the solitude was. I didn't know that peace was just the silence before a storm.

On my second day, I started to feel a strange sense of ownership over the place. Like the silence belonged to me. That evening, before my shift, I stopped at a little diner nearby for a coffee. And that’s when my peaceful world got its first crack. Four young guys walked in, loud, arrogant, with a mean sort of energy about them. As one of them passed my table, he ""accidentally"" knocked my cup, spilling hot coffee on my pants.

""Hey, watch it!"" I said.

""What'd you say to me?"" The one who spilled it turned on me. ""You think we're scared of you, new security?""

All four of them crowded my table. Just then, the owner, an old-timer everyone called ""Old Man Harris,"" came from behind the counter.

""Alright, boys, that's enough,"" he said. ""Leave the kid alone. He's just doing his job.""

They reluctantly respected Harris. But before they left, the tallest one looked me dead in the eye, gave me a little wink, and said, ""We'll see you around... guard.""

The encounter left a bad taste in my mouth, but I shook it off and went to work. That night, as I was walking the long corridor of A-Block, I felt a new sound join the echo of my own footsteps. It was a faint, dragging sound, like someone in the next row over was trying to match my pace, step for step. When I stopped, it stopped. When I started walking again, it started too. The incident at the diner flashed in my mind. Was it one of them? Or… was this something else?

On the third night, that question was answered right at my front gate. Around 2 a.m., a pair of headlights sliced through the darkness. It was them. The four guys from the diner.

""Open the gate!"" one of them yelled.

""Sorry, no access after 10 p.m.,"" I said firmly.

They got out of the car, surrounding me like a pack of wolves. ""We told you,"" the tall one said, getting right in my face. ""We'd see you around. There aren't any cameras here, are there? Anything can happen in a place this lonely at night. No one would even hear you scream.""

They didn't touch me. But their words were worse than any punch. After a few minutes of intimidation, they laughed, got back in their car, and sped off.

The next day was the longest of my life. I went home with my hands still trembling. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw their faces, and those faces got tangled up with the phantom footsteps I'd heard. The line between a human threat and a supernatural one was starting to blur in my mind.

I decided I couldn't just sit back. I called the local police during the day and explained what happened. The officer on the phone sounded bored. ""Look, kid, we can't file a report for some guys being jerks. Just be careful.""

After I hung up, I felt more alone than ever. I called my boss. ""Sir, there's a problem here."" His response shattered any hope I had. ""Leo, if you're scared, just stay in the shack. But if you walk out, I'm out a guard for tonight.""

I realized then, no one was coming to save me. I was on my own. And I needed the money. So, feeling like a defeated man, I decided to go in for my final shift.

But that last night was destined to change my life forever. My beat-up old car broke down on the way. By the time I got to work, it was almost 11:45 PM. I walked straight to C-Block. In the middle of the corridor, I heard it from inside unit C-73. A faint, dry scraping sound. And then, a weak, strangled voice. ""Oh… God…""

I froze. Was it a trap?

""Hello?"" I whispered.

""Please… someone… I'm trapped in here… I can't… I can't breathe…""

My mind was at war. Was this an elaborate trap to lure me in? Or was there a real person dying on the other side of that door? If I called 911 and it was a prank, I'd be a fool. If I didn't call, I'd be a monster. I took a deep breath and dialed 911.

The next ten minutes were the longest of my life. The sounds from inside had stopped completely. That silence was a thousand times more terrifying than the whispers. The distant wail of sirens was like music from heaven.

Two officers, Henderson and his partner, arrived. Henderson was skeptical, but the situation was serious enough to get permission to cut the lock. The whole corridor was dead silent, except for the click of the bolt cutters closing on the lock.

Then, a violent, metallic SNAP that echoed through the building like a gunshot. Henderson rolled up the door, and the screech of the metal was like a scream from a dying man.

The door opened to the smell of dust and neglect. We saw nothing but old boxes. For a second, my whole body went cold with shame. I was a fool.

""There's no one he—"" the young cop started to say, but Henderson held up a hand. ""Wait."" His flashlight beam was fixed on one spot. In the far corner, behind a filthy mattress, under a grimy tarp… was a human foot.

Henderson drew his weapon and moved in slowly. He pulled the tarp aside, and the three of us saw her. A woman, unconscious, but still breathing.

From that moment, everything became a blur of motion. Paramedics, more cops, yellow tape. But in my mind, everything was in slow motion. As they carried her out on a stretcher, I saw her hand fall limp, her fingertips just barely grazing the concrete floor I was standing on.

As dawn approached, everyone was gone. I was alone again in that cold, silent place. I sat in my shack, trying to piece it all together. The shadow footsteps... the incident at the diner... the threat at the gate... my car breaking down... me being late… me stumbling right into their plan.

And that's when it hit me. I was hiding from a ghost, while the real monsters were just feet away, in the dark, watching me.

But the biggest question gnawed at me: Why didn't they just attack me? I was alone. They were four. Why did they just wait?

And then, like a shard of ice sliding down my spine, the answer hit me. An answer so cold it burned. They didn't attack me... because attacking me was the stupidest thing they could have done. Killing a night watchman turns it into a major homicide investigation. It brings heat.

Their best move wasn't to eliminate me. It was to disappear.

They weren't waiting for the cops to arrive. They were waiting for the chaos the cops would bring. The sirens, the flashing lights, every officer's attention focused on a single door—C-73. In the middle of that confusion, under the cover of the official response itself, four shadows could easily slip out of another unit, another block, and vanish into the night.

I wasn't a threat to be eliminated. I was just... a complication to be managed. And somehow, that was a thousand times more terrifying.

I quit that morning. I never went back. But the memory of that night follows me, an echo in a silent corridor. Even now, on a quiet night, I'm afraid of the sound of my own breathing.",1,1763796232.0,u_Surjaymp,0,1.0,False

I want to say this happened in the early summer when our park was full of hikers, campers, and tourists. Montana had its beauty in those summer months, so I couldn’t blame them.
A lot of the tourists hadn’t spent a day camping or even been backpacking. A lot of them hopped out of their cars to take close-up pictures of bison, so you can imagine we had a fair share of people getting lost. Hell, most of the time when I was on tower duty for the summer, I had to guide lost hikers back to the trail instead of watching for wildfires.
I always pictured being a park ranger as a relaxing job, and that was the case in ’94, before everything happened. We didn’t think much of it at first. There seemed to be more cases of rabies, more wildlife we had to put down, which had us carrying our .38 with us whenever we went out, putting more rifles in our trucks. I used to complain about having that heavy wheel gun hanging from my hip. It was heavy and got in the way of a pack and made my hips chafe sometimes. I wasn’t really used to carrying around a gun; I had only shot one maybe a few times. I stopped complaining after what happened in June.
Then we had the first incident at the start of the tour season. I was lying in my cot at the station, fast asleep, when the phone rang. I grumbled as I sat up and grabbed the phone.
“Hello?” I asked in a groggy voice.
I recognized my supervisor’s voice on the other end of the line.
“Hey Ash, we got a call at one of the campgrounds—some kind of disturbance going on there.”
I brushed my bangs out of my face as I held the phone in the crook of my neck.
“What kind of disturbance?” I asked, furrowing my brow slightly.
I heard my supervisor sigh through the slight static.
“Some people making a huge ruckus after quiet hours. Sounded like some rowdy kids blaring Nirvana.”
I yawned and quickly covered my mouth with my free hand.
“Who else is going down there?” I asked as I kicked the blankets off my body.
“Hmm. I have Felix on the way over, so I just need you to go with him. They’re probably drunk, so don’t get yourself hurt.”
I chuckled softly and tapped my foot on the edge of the cot.
“All I’m gonna do is tell them to turn down the music in my fancy uniform, Jake.”
He snorted softly at this. “Yeah, sure, killer. Sorry about waking you up for this, but a lot of the overnighters are tied up on tower duty. The other seasonals haven’t really started pouring in yet.”
I let out a sigh. “Same old story then. I’ll call you after I deal with it. Won’t take long. You have a good night, right? Tell Lauren I said hi.”
“Thanks, Ash, you have a good night too.”
I hung up the phone and made my way to my locker. It didn’t take me long to change into my uniform. I slipped on my jacket and grabbed my duty belt. I left that stupid wide-brimmed hat and just opted to wear the baseball-cap version I brought last summer.
The station was pretty quiet this time, and I made sure to grab a jolt from the fridge before I headed out. I had a feeling tonight would be a long night of paperwork—probably would need a second one before dawn, knowing me. Not to mention the coffee at the station tasted like dirt.
I passed Mel at the front desk, wearing a Walkman, probably listening to whatever they constantly blared on MTV while flipping through the glossy pages of the newest issue of Seventeen. She looked at me and gave me a wave as I returned it on my way out the door.
The lot was pretty deserted compared to how it gets later in the season. There were only two patrol trucks, mine and Mel’s; besides everyone’s personal cars, of course. Jake really wasn’t kidding about being short-staffed.
There was no wind that night—I remember that distinctly more than anything else. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky. The moon hung low in the pitch-black night. The only sound I could hear in that quiet parking lot was a great-horned owl hooting in the distant treeline, as well as my set of keys jingling on my belt as I walked to my truck.
I cracked open the can of Jolt as I put my keys in the ignition and let my truck rumble to life. I pulled out of the lot onto the gravel road and began to drive. I turned on my radio and tuned into the nearest station; one of those late-night stations with a barely-awake DJ mumbling out song names. This happened to be playing eighties pop—could be worse, I suppose.
My headlights were my only source of light on those winding back-country roads. I was glad to be used to traversing the rough roads here. It wasn’t long before I reached the campgrounds. Despite being early in the season, the campgrounds were still pretty packed.
I pulled through the checkpoint, passing the worn-out volunteer stuck on gate duty. There weren’t many lights on at this time of night; the only lighting I could make out from the hazy windows of my truck was from the sparsely placed streetlights and the dim orange glow from dying campfires. I turned around a small bend in the road to see at least four cars crammed into a parking space meant for three. Several tents were set up in random spots around the campsite. Most of them didn’t even look like they were staked in properly.
Even from the road I could hear the music blaring from some boombox they had near the still-burning campfire. What already stuck out to me was that there wasn’t anyone out and about. Sure, it was late, but the fire was still going pretty strong. Someone had fed it within an hour or two. Had they just been so drunk they passed out in their tents?
There wasn’t long to debate what could have happened when I saw a pair of headlights approaching in my rearview mirror. I quickly recognized it to be one of our trucks. I put my own truck in park and killed the engine. I stepped out and gave a wave to Felix’s truck as I heard the sound of a car door opening and closing. I heard a softer-spoken voice.
“I thought you were gonna get some sleep tonight?”
I shrugged as I saw the tall form of Felix saunter into view in his faded uniform. “So did I, but here I am.”
“Jake’s doing, I’m guessing?” he asked as he rubbed his unshaven chin.
I sighed and nodded my head, and Felix gave me a sympathetic smile as he motioned for me to follow him. We both took out our flashlights and began to walk toward the campsite.
“I wouldn’t worry about it, Ashley. It’s only your second summer here after all.”
I nodded in agreement as I boot crunched a pine cone in half. “I know, but it feels like I’m left holding the bag sometimes.”
Felix scratched the back of his neck. “It might seem like that, but he’s doing this for a reason.”
I tilted my head slightly as I looked over at him. “He’s testing me,” I mused aloud. Felix snapped his calloused fingers and flashed a grin.
“See—you’re a smart girl. Think about it, how many out-of-towners flood this place with applications every summer?”
“A lot,” I responded as I pondered where he was going with this.
“Gotta weed out who can’t stick it out here.”
“Makes sense. I guess I am a long way from San Diego.”
He chuckled softly. “Miss the palm trees and beaches?”
“Nope. And don’t miss the traffic either.”
We both shared a soft chuckle as we entered the campsite, clearing our throats and putting our minds back to the task at hand. Felix called out in a professional, practiced voice that we were rangers with the park and needed them to turn down the music since it was past quiet hour.
We didn’t get a response. I shined my light around the campsite and noticed several camp chairs set up outside the radius of the fire’s glow. A few were knocked over, to no surprise. I saw some empty cans of Blue Ribbon and a few half-finished bottles of Jack Daniels. All classic choices for teens who didn’t understand what good booze was yet.
I took a few more steps into the campsite. The boombox was still blaring “Smells Like Teen Spirit” in the deserted campsite. I quickly picked up the scent of cigarettes from a still-lit cigarette resting in a crowded ashtray on a picnic table. Something wasn’t right here. Sure, they could be passed out asleep in their tents, but all these cars, all these tents, all these empty chairs—and not a single one is a snorer after a long night of drinking?
There was only silence in response to Felix’s announcement. We both exchanged looks even in the darkness of the unusual night; there was a hint of worry in the experienced ranger’s eyes. He quieted his voice and got a more focused glint in his eyes that I hadn’t seen before.
“Come on, let’s check the tents if anyone is in there.”
I nodded in agreement as I shined my light on the nearby tents. We both split off to check the tents for any occupants. I announced myself before zipping open a tent, expecting to find a drunken couple deep in the moment. But all I saw were empty sleeping bags, scattered magazines, and half-open duffel bags. Some had clothes scattered around on the tent floor—definitely kids my age. The only thing missing were the hammered frat guys sleeping away a night of boozing. I checked the other tents to find more or less the same.
Felix and I met back up near the campfire, both of us not finding the campers yet.
“It’s like they all just wandered off,” I said softly to him.
“They couldn’t have gone far; cars are still here.” He rubbed his chin thoughtfully as he shined his beam near the edge of the campsite. He seemed to focus on something I couldn’t see very well from the angle I was looking at it.
“Ash, come look at this,” he said as he walked over toward the edge of the campsite, shining the beam of his flashlight at something on the ground. I made my way over to his side.
“What is it?” I inquired as I squinted at what he was looking at.
“See some prints going into the woods—kinda looks like some drag marks too. There’s some wildlife tracks, too.”
“Drag marks?” I replied, furrowing my brow.
“Yeah… looks pretty fresh, too,” he added, a frown forming on his face.
“Think we should call Jake about this?”
Felix took in a deep breath as if in thought for a moment. “Not yet. I need to grab something from my truck—come on.”
I followed him to his truck; a sense of unease had begun to descend on me ever since we found the empty campsite. At this time I didn’t know why.
Felix opened the back door and dug through a large duffel. I almost asked what he was looking for—then he pulled it out. A strange rifle, loading it with a stripper clip of .308s.
It wasn’t like the long, sleek rifles in the glossy Cabela’s catalogs that came in the mail. This one was almost ugly. The wood was worn and unpolished, the barrel stubby but menacing, like it had come from another era. He racked the bolt with a sharp motion, then turned and looked back at me.
“What? It’s bear country, Ash.”
“Is that what you think happened? A grizzly snatched them?”
“I don’t know.” He sighed and rubbed his face with his free hand. “We do need to make sure they’re okay. I know if I called Jake he would just write it off or make us wait for hours till county gets here.”
“He would, so let’s give him something he can’t ignore.” He said as he put his flashlight back on his belt and replaced it with a headlamp.
We both set out to follow the drag marks. We didn’t say anything as we began to walk into the shadowy treeline.
Every couple of steps we called out if anyone was out there and if they were lost. Our voices reverberated across the pines. We shone our lights around our surroundings, looking for any signs of these drunk college kids. The night was still, soundless. Not even a single bird or bug could be heard. I couldn’t even feel any soft gusts of wind. I kept listening for the smallest sound, any kind of sign of someone lost out there.
I felt my stomach begin to swirl. We couldn’t even hear the music anymore—it was like the air itself was siphoning the sounds of the night away.
That’s when I finally saw it, hiding in a collection of vegetation. A pair of eyes staring back at me. I shined my light at it and my eyes widened. A young, teary-eyed woman stared back at me with blond hair like mine. She was kneeling down by a man that looked to be around the same age as her. A large, seeping gash was ripped across his leg. He didn’t seem to be conscious from the blood loss. One of the woman’s petite hands was tightly pressed against his wound; her other hand clutched his. Her face was deathly pale; I could see her whole body was shaking. She seemed to struggle to keep her breathing under control. Several times she kept opening and closing her mouth to say something to us, but her words refused to leave her mouth. She had several small cuts adorning her exposed arms. Her delicate face was cut up like she had been scratched by branches from a hasty escape. Who I assumed to be her boyfriend had similar cuts on his face.
I felt frozen in place as I put a hand to my mouth. I kept screaming at my legs to move but they wouldn’t; in fact, I couldn’t feel them at all. That girl’s face—desperate for anything, anyone that could escape this horrible place. I finally swallowed my fear and sprang into action—and so did Felix. I kneeled down beside the couple and set my bag down. I practically ripped it open to get my first-aid kit out.
Felix was faster than me; his hands were shaking less than mine. I yanked out some four-by-four gauze and started to press it into the wound as Felix started to get out some roller gauze and help me wrap the wound up. The girl still clutched his hand for dear life, never leaving his side.
I had to gently move her hand aside from the wound so I could help Felix bandage it up. She didn’t ever raise her voice or make much of a sound besides some almost-inaudible murmurs. Even though I couldn’t make out her exact words, I could tell she was praying.
“Ash, take care of him. I got him,” he said as he quickly took control of the situation. I took the woman’s bloodied hand into my own, not giving a shit about the blood right now. She turned her gaze to me, asking a silent question.
“We’ll take care of him, don’t worry,” I said in my best reassuring voice.
She quickly nodded and finally released her iron grip on her boyfriend’s hand. Felix quickly hefted the young man over his shoulder and nodded to me.
“Thank you…” the girl murmured to me as she held onto my hand tightly like it was her only escape.
“Come on, we need to go, okay?” I said gently to her as her green eyes flickered over to the trees deeper into the woods.
“But my friends are still out there!” she finally raised her voice to my surprise. Felix noticed my hesitation and answered for me.
“Look, miss, we need to get him to a hospital or he won’t make it. We’re gonna call for more rangers to find your friends, alright?”
This seemed to satisfy her well enough and she nodded a few times and sniffed.
“Right, I’m sorry—I just—”
“It’s alright, you don’t need to apologize. Let’s get you out of here.” I added as Felix started to jog back with the wounded man still over his shoulder. I led the terrified girl through the darkness by her trembling hand, flashlight in my other. I could hear Felix’s heavy footsteps crunching pine needles ahead of me.
“Are they gonna be okay?” she asked anxiously, her eyes darting all around.
“They’ll be okay,” I replied, not believing my own word. Even though I was definitely not alone, I felt something else—I didn’t even know how to describe it.
I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I could feel eyes bearing their gaze upon me, but I couldn’t tell from where. I quickened my pace slightly, tugging on the girl’s arm to get her to move a bit faster.
“What’s your name?” I asked her, trying to take my mind off this sensation.
She hesitated for a few moments before finally speaking up.
“Jessica.” She tried to add a smile, but her nerves failed her.
“I’m Ash; the big guy who grabbed your boyfriend is Felix,” I said, looking over my shoulder at her with a soft smile. She slowly returned the smile with some hesitation.
I could tell we were getting close to the campsite by the sounds of grunge rock echoing through the shadowy trees.
We finally reached the dim glow of the campfire. I could see Felix by his truck with the young man laid out on the truck bed with the hastily made bandage now wrapped in Coban.
Felix stood close by, one hand resting on the edge of the truck bed, the other holding the receiver of an old Motorola bag phone. The bulky nylon case sat beside him, the coiled cord stretched just far enough to let him pace a little. I assumed he was calling Jake—or someone from the emergency line—but I couldn’t tell. His voice was low, tight. Whatever he was saying wasn’t for me.
Jess broke away from my grip and ran over to her boyfriend’s side. Even though he was still unresponsive, I could see his chest rising and falling, the slight vibrations in his chest from his still-beating heart.
As Felix was busy, I walked over to the boombox and finally shut it off. I turned back and made my way over to Jess’s side as she tapped her fingers on her boyfriend’s open palm. I finally asked the question that had been circling like a vulture on my mind this entire time.
“What exactly happened out there?”
I asked as I rested my arms on the top side of the truck bed. Jessica’s eyes averted mine as she stared at the ground.
“I don’t know…where to even start,” she said as she rubbed her face. I quietly waited for her to continue as I pressed a hand to her shoulder.
“One second we were drinking, having fun…then it was just—”
She paused as she wiped her eyes, taking a moment to compose herself.
“The music was so loud but I could still hear Eric screaming when it grabbed him.”
“Something grabbed him? An animal? A person?”
“I don’t know, I never got a good look at it. It started to drag him into the woods and…my legs just started moving on their own. I don’t know what came over me.”
I took a notepad out and started scribbling some notes as she spoke. It helped keep my shaking hands busy.
“What about your friends? Did they do the same?”
She gave me a short nod.
“They did, but I was first. I saw so much red. I grabbed the pocket knife he gave me for my sixteenth. I just stabbed it…again and again. It made such awful sounds—”
“Did…you kill it?” I asked with a raised eyebrow, and she gave me a slight shrug.
“I don’t know, but it let him go and everyone just scattered. I panicked—we all did. I didn’t know what to do besides hide and hope it didn’t find us again. It sounded like it was screaming like a person when I stabbed it.”
I stopped writing and looked up at her, truly at a loss about what she was describing. None of it made any sense to me. My only guess was a mountain lion or some psycho. Both sounded far-fetched the more I thought about it. Mountain lions prefer easy prey—people alone, isolated—not a packed campsite full of noise, even if they were starving.
Perhaps it was a person? Some kind of deranged psycho living in the woods, targeting clueless campers? Sounded like the plot of some shitty slasher—one with a masked serial killer. Then again, he would be a pretty bad one if all it took to stop him was a half-sober, petrified sorority girl with a pocket knife that probably hadn’t been used for anything besides cutting nails and whittling out of boredom.
A silence fell on us as we quietly waited for our backup. Felix stood closest to the wood’s edge with his rifle propped up on his truck. Every couple of minutes, he would turn on his headlamp and scan the treeline; he never saw anything. I draped a blanket around Jess—she wouldn’t stop shivering. Even as the minutes drew by, what felt like hours, my hands wouldn’t stop shaking, but I didn’t know why. The woods still didn’t make a sound even as I felt a gentle breeze brush upon my face.
Finally, we all heard the sound of approaching sirens in the distance. All three of us peeked our heads up. Our backup was here after what felt like an eternity. I first noticed the red flashing lights from a county ambulance with peeling paint, followed by a couple of our trucks—not the dull flashing amber lights like I had on my truck, just like your run-of-the-mill city cop, they had red and blue lights flashing brightly against the cedars and pines. At the back of this convoy was a single black-and-white county patrol car; I was honestly surprised they bothered to send one out here—must have been a slow night.
They quickly pulled into the turnoff for one of the empty campsites and killed the wailing of their sirens. The rangers stepped out first. They didn’t dress like us. Felix and I wore cargo shorts, faded T-shirts, tired polos with cheap name tags pinned on, and dusty hiking boots. These rangers wore tan collared shirts and dark green cargo pants, black Danners. I noticed quickly some wore those detestable wide-brimmed hats but a lot of them only wore baseball caps. Each of them wore a high-vis vest stamped with “LAW ENFORCEMENT” in large bold letters. They slung scoped game rifles or semi-auto shotguns—likely loaded with bear slugs—over their shoulders. A few of them carried bulkier, heavy-duty tranquilizer rifles with longer scopes. I noticed clunky handheld radios dangled from their belts. No doubt these were the usual guys they called in when the wildlife got bold. They didn’t say anything to us but Felix said we could help look for the missing campers.
These weren’t the rangers that smiled and waved from behind desks at the visitor centers or handed out trail maps at junctions. These were the guys you called to track and kill a thousand-pound grizzly that mauled a camper. These were the guys who carried bodies out of ravines. They worked in places where the nearest backup was hours away.
Small crowds began to gather, drawn by the lights and sirens screaming in well after quiet hours. Barefoot kids peeked out from dome-shaped Power Rangers tents, Game Boys in hand. The soft, sickly golden glow from their wormlights illuminated quietly worried faces. Flannel-clad dads sat in folding chairs outside their RVs, Miller High Lifes still cold from the cooler, trading guesses about why all the uniforms were out here. Mothers in hoodies gently tried to herd their kids back to bed. The flashing lights painted the pines in red and blue long after the sirens had gone quiet.
I looked over at the ambulance as two guys in plain navy-cargo pants and windbreakers carted away Eric on a stretcher with Jess hovering close by. One of the newly arrived rangers handed us some handheld radios and muttered something about not chasing after grizzly bears. They turned on dark green angle lights clipped to their vests and split into pairs as they carefully entered the treeline, their rifles held low. Our radios crackled with their chatter.
“Station, this is Ranger 8. We’re gonna need SAR volunteers rounded up to cover this much ground—over.”
“Copy that, we’ll assemble a search party. Standby.”
“10-4.”
I turned down the volume on my radio as Felix and I ended up being paired off together. I noticed the deputy they dragged along with them was talking to another guy not in any kind of uniform—button-up shirt and slacks with a badge clipped to his belt. A sidearm was concealed in a leather shoulder holster. I assumed he was some kind of detective. Not sure what he was gonna investigate in this neck of the woods.
I was sure this was just another rabid animal to be put down, just like the other reports. Felix still took the lead, the rifle hanging over his chest. I was glad to be paired up with him—from the way he was able to follow those tracks from before. All those hunting trips he had been taking with his son had finally paid off. I was a little bit jealous after the fact I never figured out why.
As we were walking under the shadowy arms of the spruces, flashlights in hand, I first smelled it—something that struck out from the usual scents of the forests of Montana. There was hardly even wind to carry it, so it took a second for me to register what I was smelling. Honestly, it was pretty repulsive when it finally hit me. I caught a whiff of what smelled like ammonia, like someone had been pouring jugs of bleach out in the middle of the woods.
I looked down to see if it had been something I had stepped on. I furrowed my brow as the dull golden beam of my flashlight reflected the sight of clotted droplets of blood clinging to pine needles and fallen leaves. The droplets continued down the makeshift game trail. Neither of us said a word to each other. Felix muttered a short transmission into the radio. He turned to me and we just exchanged a nod and kept going.
The smell only got stronger as we kept walking. The blood started to get more visible—going from sparse drops to scattered puddles. Felix started walking slower, taking more deliberate steps now, heel to toe, muffling the stomping of his boots crunching pine needles.
We finally reached the end of the blood trail. The smell was almost unbearable now; I felt lightheaded from the overwhelming stench.
We both stopped in our tracks at what we heard. From the sounds I could hear it making—how it wheezed—I could tell it was struggling to stay alive. It emitted a series of harsh gasps and sputters. I felt like I was about to throw up from even being near it. I squinted my eyes as I finally could make out where the sounds were coming from. A shadowy shape lay on its side staring at us from under a birch. Even though I couldn’t see its eyes I could feel them bearing their weight down on my skull.
I swallowed my nausea and fear and finally shined my flashlight on it. Our eyes widened at what we saw. I wanted to run away from this thing and never think about it, bury it out of mind, but my primal focus seemed to take hold.
I would have thought it was an elk if I had just glanced at it for a split second. But it wasn’t one—at least not anymore. It used to be a bull, still had those velvety furred antlers from an early summer. Its eyes were what struck me the most. They were clouded, colorless, like a corpse. I couldn’t even tell if they had pupils anymore. Its eyes kept twitching almost like they were loose in their sockets, about to pop out at any moment.
It was still laid out on its side. Its head raised to continue to gaze at us. Some of its fur was matted with blood; it looked like its own blood. Its jaws were entirely misshapen. I was about to wonder why when I got my answer. It opened its gaping maw—it had too many teeth. Rows and rows of newly grown incisors were tightly crammed into its original set of teeth, like a shark’s. Its newly grown teeth were coated in fresh blood. The sounds it made were like it was gurgling and choking on its blood. That’s when I finally noticed where Jess made her mark: sticking out from between its collarbone and shoulder was the hilt of a buck knife, blood still seeping from the fresh wound.
I shined my light down to its legs as it began to move. All four of its legs were bent and twisted into horrible angles; its length extended beyond the realm of possibility. Bones jutted out like spikes from its horribly mangled limbs. Despite the fact that it shouldn’t have been able to stand, let alone move at all, it still did.
Even with the distance between me and that thing, I still heard its legs crack and crunch as limbs began to snap and break in new ways with each passing moment. It should have been screaming, howling in agony, but it didn’t make a sound. It only let out soft retching and a sound of gagging. I felt bile begin to travel up my throat with every bone it snapped further into impossible angles.
Felix still had the rifle. “C-cover your ears,” he commanded with a slight wavering in his voice.
I didn’t question it or hesitate to do as he said.
I could tell Felix was trying to put on a brave face around me—not because he wanted to look macho or impress me or anything. He knew I would panic if a veteran ranger like him lost his cool. I could still hear it in his voice, the slight hesitation in his words. His normally tanned face was as pale as that thing’s eyes.
It was in the process of walking forward when I finally heard the deafening roar from Felix’s rifle. It didn’t seem to register that it had been shot. A gaping hole was now barreled in between its eyes—Felix wasn’t bullshitting about those hunting stories after all. Blood began to bleed from its new wound. It sat on its haunches and flexed its jaw a few times as it rocked its head up and down. It crumpled over to the side and began kicking its back legs wildly; after less than thirty seconds it let out a few more twitches before falling motionless entirely. A puddle of blood began to form under its slaw jawed face. Our radios started to squawk with questions on who fired that shot.
We both let out a collected breath that we had been holding this entire time. I heard the sound of Felix charging the bolt and ejecting the still-smoking brass from the chamber.
The scent of ammonia began to fade away as the scent of carbon and gunpowder filled my nostrils. I didn’t say anything, but with trembling hands he grabbed his radio and spoke into it.
“All stations… one round fired. Aggressive wildlife is down. Situation is… under control.”
There was a long silence on the air, and Felix spoke again, “Bring gloves.”
“10-4.”
I reached into my pack and got something I didn’t think I would be using at this moment but felt compelled to do. I grabbed my Polaroid camera.
It was a gift from Mom two summers ago before I left. I promised her I would take pictures of the park for her. I hung up pictures of hot springs in my locker—the breathtaking views of the snow-covered mountains and extinct volcanos from the balcony of a lonely firetower. I sent them back to Cali in half-crumpled envelopes. I never thought I would take a picture like… this.
The camera’s flash filled my vision as my camera spit out a newly printed Polaroid. I began to shake the photo as it developed. A small comfort was brought from doing such a mundane and familiar task. I expected Felix to say some cheesy one-liner from a trashy action movie to cut the tension, but he never did.
I looked over at him—the rifle now slung over his shoulder. He clutched it tightly, his fingers trembling, knuckles snow-white. I could hear his soft, unsteady breathing.
I reached out, quietly, and rested my hand on his arm.
He flinched at first, his head twitching toward me on instinct.
I didn’t pull away. Instead, I tightened my grip just a little.
He closed his eyes. Breathed in. Breathed out.
Then he nodded. “I’m fine, I just—” he softly murmured, not finishing his sentence.
I gently caressed his forearm with my fingertips before pulling my hand back. My fingers were still shaking.
The sound of dry leaves crunching approached us as the beams of two flashlights drew near.
We looked over to see two law-enforcement rangers walking quietly up to the body of the thing.
I expected them to say something as they shined their beams over what lay there, but they didn’t. One of them nodded at Felix, who still held the rifle, the barrel smoking ever so slightly.
The taller ranger set his bag down and pulled a bright-yellow Kodak from a smaller compartment inside a Ziploc bag.
He raised the camera and took a quick photo with a soft snap as the flash lit up the carcass. He stepped closer, focusing the lens on the hilt of the knife. Then he stowed the camera in his cargo pocket and scribbled down the frame number and a short note in a small notebook before giving a nod to the second ranger.
The second ranger unfolded a black tarp from his pack and draped it over the misshapen elk. He cracked a blue chemlight and taped it to the tarp with a strip of surveyor’s tape. One of them reached for his shoulder mic and spoke into it.
“Station, this is Ranger Three. We got a DB flagged with a blue chemlight. Northwest—eight hundred meters into the treeline, over.”
“Copy. DB marked with a blue chemlight. Southwest—eight hundred meters in, out.”
Neither Felix nor I said a word. I expected them to lose their composure, to stammer out some half-witted explanation of what we were looking at. But they didn’t. I could have sworn I heard one of them mutter another one under their breath.
This wasn’t their first time.
One of them finally looked over at us. “You two, head back. Jake’s waiting for you by the trucks.”
Felix nodded quietly. I didn’t move. He started to walk away but quickly noticed I wasn’t following—I was still staring at that tarp, the misshapen cloven hooves just barely visible from the edges. Felix put a hand on my back and gently urged me forward.
“C’mon, Ash…” he said quietly. I silently nodded and followed him back toward the trucks.
We didn’t say anything to each other during the walk back, but Felix was walking a bit slower than before. He kept the rifle close, holding it tightly. As we walked, he would shine his light in the trees as we passed them, but we never saw anything.
The flashing lights guided us through the quiet forest. It didn’t take long for us to get back to the campsite and all those emergency vehicles; the crowd was still there now, a few more strong after the gunshot they probably heard.
Among the lines of emergency was the shape of my supervisor—Jake was leaning up against his truck, reds and blues painting his face as he took a long drag from a lit cigarette while he spoke to what I assumed to be some kind of detective or government official from earlier. The ambulance had already left with the couple.
The two of them stopped their conversation as we approached them. The well-dressed man looked over at me and gave me a professional but warm smile. I’ll admit—he was a lot better-looking than most cops I’d seen. He was clean-cut, sharp as a razor, maybe a little older than what I usually go for. He honestly looked like he could have made it as an actor out in Hollywood if he tried.
“Ashley, I presume?” he said with practiced politeness. I nodded as he continued speaking.
“I know you’ve both had a long night so I won’t take up your time.”
He reached into his pocket and handed us two laminated cards.
“Here’s my card—if you want to talk about what happened after some rest, feel free to give me a call.”
I looked down at it and squinted slightly at the neatly printed text: “Detective Reid Callahan, Yellowstone County Sheriff’s Office,” followed by his badge number, phone number, office address, and fax number.
“Sure,” I said, nodding a little as I pocketed the card, feeling the need for sleep gnawing at my brain. Jake glanced over at me, noticing just how worn out I looked.
“Both of you did amazing work finding those two tonight. We’ll handle the rest. You two can take off and have the next few days off.”
We thanked him, and he tossed a pack of Marlboro Reds each. I didn’t smoke.
Felix and I silently shambled back to our trucks. Before he climbed into the driver’s seat, I wordlessly pushed the pack of smokes into his hand while trying to manage a smile, but it probably looked pretty pathetic. I could only stare as the flashing lights filled my vision and I wondered… why, just why did this have to happen to me? Why did this happen to us?

I had this thought while watching my toaster, wondering what my deal was.  
I wasn't having a crisis, just a quiet what's the point? moment.

I was pushing to give my life some grand reason, but the harder I pushed, the sillier it seemed.  
Goals felt random, plans fell apart and meaning felt fake.

I thought I was broken, but I just thought the world owed me a story.

Things changed when I stopped seeking meaning and began treating life like a bad script that I could play with, not to fix it, but to have fun.

Here's what helped:

* Give silly names to tasks.
* Score points for random stuff.
* Assume nothing's serious at first.
* Treat your future self like a crazy roommate.
* When stressed, say This is a weird way to be a mammal and keep going.

Once I stopped demanding perfection, my worry eased up.  
Stop fighting the crazy, and your brain chills out.  
Suddenly, the normal stuff - coffee, stairs, emails - feels okay, even funny.

I then read something from [NoFluffWisdom](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/subscribe) that made me realize I wasn’t lost. I was just taking life too seriously for something so messy.

If life seems crazy, that's good.  
You're seeing it right.

Honestly when I mention this to people, no one else seems to remember this. I’m not sure why this seems to linger in my mind every night. When I mention the riots in 95 they talk about the riots in LA.

They don’t remember the sirens screaming all night. They don’t remember the men in gas masks knocking on every door, telling us to leave. The shortages, the fear, the paranoia, the evacuations of entire cities, almost the whole state. 

I was one of the few who stayed, some couldn’t leave for other reasons. Some chose not to leave. Sometimes I would find their doors broken down and their bodies shredded like sheets of paper. As for me, I stayed because I had a new job to do.

They call us collectors, in reality we just go off whatever names they give us. Some call us vultures. Usually people are desperate enough or crazy enough to collect samples and intelligence from the quarantine zone for the eggheads or uncle sam. Some of us lived colorful lives. Some were given a choice of prison or being a collector. Some of us were contractors before this or washed up veterans or ex cops. As for me, I had my own reasons.

They send us in by ourselves or in pairs if they feel like we’re important. I wish I was that lucky but then again, luck has never been my strong suit. Then again when we’re not doing Washington’s dirty work we’re holed up somewhere, licking our wounds out of the cold. Some like to make their own little hideouts in the nooks and crannies, as for me. I always believed in safety in numbers, plus they tend to attack groups of people. 

I tended to shack up in this big church, some other collectors were there every now and again. Usually it was just me, the pastor and a few vagrants who had nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to. It was a nice spot actually, the pastor always kept the fire going, and had some beds set out in the main worship area. 

It was like any other day in this hellhole of a state. I was sitting by the fireplace on a cushion with a cup of coffee cradled in my hands, instant of course. But hey I take what I can get. Despite the coffee tasting like a combination of charcoal and gas with the absence of sugar. I took another sip as I glanced over my shoulder to see a few people huddled in blankets with lit cigarettes hanging from their chapped lips. I glanced out the warped window to see the snow was starting to pick up, snowflakes began to gently tap the window.

I was just about to finish my coffee when I heard the distinct sound of my pager chiming. I groaned as I dug into my pocket for it and glanced down at the miniscule screen to see a radio frequency to tune into. I gulped the last of my gritty coffee and trasped over to my bag to my SINCGARS radio and set it up real quick, setting it to single channel and plain text, then punching in the freq. I took hold of the receiver and began to speak into it.

“Scepter to Nest, radio check over”

The feminine voice of my handler chimed in from the other end of the net.

“Hearing you, got some work for you”.

“Hit me”.

“Got a hit from the marines saying there’s some unusual activity in the mall on grover street, they want a specialist to look into it.”

I rolled my eyes and let out a sigh.
“Could they be more specific?” 

There was a short pause before nest finally responded.

“Some of the grunts said they heard coming from the old mall, not sure how its possible”.

“Yeah me neither, well I’ll start hoofing it there”

“Oh no need for that, there’s a convoy that you can hitch a ride with to the mall.”

I furrowed my brow 

“How did you manage that?”

I heard a soft chuckle from the other end.

“I have my ways, get geared, they're gonna pick you up soon”.

“I hear, scepter over and out”.

I said as I hung up the receiver and gathered up my gear. Of course it really wasn’t much, half of it was old surplus shit from vietnam or stuff I managed to get from camping stores that weren’t completely looted. I finished putting on my MOPP suit and clipped on my gas mask bag to my hip. I grabbed my alice and my weapon case and walked outside as I could hear the sound of diesel engines rumbling closer outside. 

I walked outside to see a six vehicle convoy of weathered humvees and five ton trucks driving down the snow covered street with a truck with a snow plow mounted on the front clearing the way. The line of vehicles came to a halt. A marine in full MOPP gear waved over to me from a canvas covered truck. I walked over as he leaned out the driver side window to get a better look at me.

“You the collector?” He asked the gas mask, muffling his voice.
I nodded and he thumbed behind him. 

“Hop in man, we’ll drop you off on the way”.   

I didn’t waste any time and quickly threw my things in the back of the covered five ton. I chambered into the shadowy interior. Half of the metal benches inside were occupied by the hunched over shapes of marines with combat loads, rifles slung over their chests. Arms crossed as some shivered in their MOPP gear. Some opted to not wear their gas masks as lit cigarettes hung from their lips. Stacks of framed alice packs filled the empty space from across the benches. I settled in my icey seat as a few of the marines offered grunts of acknowledgement. 

The truck let out a hiss before speeding off with delay. There was little sound besides the rumble of the engines as the scent of burning diesel and cigarette smoke hit my nostrils. I gazed out the back of the truck as the convoy passed half buried wreckages of cars and remains of what were once police checkpoints. 

The uncomfortable silence was finally broken as one of the younger marines turned to look at me. A question deep in his mind.

“I gotta ask, why do you collectors do this shit? Ain’t most of you civies?”

I snapped out of my own trance as I pivoted to him. I offered a shrug

“Most of us are, but we all got our reasons. Just like all of you I’m sure”.

“But we’re kind of forced to be here. You can just leave…right?” He asked naively and I quietly scoffed at this.

“You must be new around here, we can’t leave even if we wanted to”.

This seemed to deflate his desire to ask more questions as his shoulders slumped but he remained silent. The truck continued to rumble as it negotiated a large pothole that had no doubt only gotten bigger from the year or so of non-existent repairs.

The convoy stopped just shy of entering a semi crowded parking lot. Some cars were still left. Many of the windows had already been smashed, the tires slashed, or missing entirely. Even with the snow I could still see piles of scorched tires. Half frozen corpses still buckled into their seats. Some clutched their loved hands never letting go even after death, some clutched icey weapons that could never save them. All too common sight nowadays, a constant reminder for those like me. Doomed to join the frost.

A multistory behemoth of concrete and faded store logos jutted out over the horizon that was once a mall. its numerous frosted over windows hide its spiraling depths from my vision. I could feel the five ton slowing to a stop as it let out another hiss before falling motionless. Without a word I stood up from my seat and dropped my gear out of the truck before hopping out myself with a grunt. 

“Good luck collector” 

One of the marines bid me as I departed. I took a deep breath before reaching for my carrier bag on my hip for my gas mask. I quickly donned it and pulled over the chemical hood, zipping it tight. The marines only stared at me as their convoy sped away, leaving me to my own devices. I reached for the receiver that hung on the straps of my bag and quickly keyed in.

“Nest I’m on site, not seeing much yet. Looks pretty standard.”

“Standard as in…?”  she responded with a pause for me to elaborate.

“Not seeing any shells, still some bodies around. Atleast not any fresh ones. Gonna load up over.”

“Well you know the deal, try to take lots of pictures and get a live feed if you can”.

“Got it”. I said as I hung up my handset on the strap of my bag. I kneeled down and began to key in my code for the case. With a soft click it slotted open. I grabbed my thirty eight and my twelve gauge. I began to load it up with double ought buckshot. I chambered a shell into the chamber and quietly walked over to the smashed front door. 

The interior was dimly lit from the half covered sky light. I could still see the outlines of abandoned storefronts hanging in the empty interior. Trash and various articles of debris dotted the floor. I stooped under the half shattered as my boots crunched under shards of glass.

“Making entry” I quietly spoke into my handset as I stepped inside. 

A long hallway of looted storefronts and barred doors spiraled ahead of me.

“Copy get me a live feed scepter.” 

Next responded with a less carefree tone. I reached for the shoulder mounted. I switched it on and set it to record.

“Live feed up”. I replied as I slung my shotgun up.

“Patching in, standby”. She stated as my camera made a few whirring noises. I reached for my belt and grabbed a flashlight, quickly switching it on to illuminate the long hallway, finally I could hear static from my radio as nest finally chimed in. 

“Alrighty, patched in! You know what to do. I’ll keep watching the feed”.
“On it” I responded softly as I carefully walked past some of the shadowy storefronts. I shined my light in as I made my way past.

The fronts that weren’t barred were completely barren from looting. I could feel the bitter air still clutch me tightly in its frigid embrace. My mask lenses fogged up slightly as I breathed out warm air.

Despite how bright my light was. The darkness of the hallway seemed to swallow the beam itself. I continued forward as I passed flickering neon signs that illuminated the floating dust particles kicked up by my boots. 

I passed the hallway into the main atrium. The main skylight acted like a beacon of brightness in rest of the lightless mall. A maze of escalators and stairs twisted around the multistory atrium. It was almost beautiful in a way.. How calm and quiet everything was now. The crowds that strangled every inch of this place either fled like roaches into the rehabitation camps or became one of the wandering shells. Not it was just us and those who don’t belong here.

I was snapped out of my thoughts as I heard the distinct sound of a phone ringing. I looked over to see several worn pay phones lined up against the nearby balcony. The ringing reverberated the empty halls as I hesitated to answer it.

‘Scepter? What's wrong?”

Nest asked with a twinge of concern in her voice.

“Got uh…a audio irregularity here nest”

I said attempting to regain my radio etiquette. Despite my hesitation to answer it, it was still ringing. It should have stopped ringing by now.

“The phone?” She asked with a hint of hesitation.

“Yeah its still ringing”. I stated slightly unnerved by the constant ringing

“Go ahead and answer it. Don’t say anything unless its necessary. I’ll listen in”.

I sighed into the mic before replying to her
“Copy”

I approached the still ringing phone. I shines my flashlight on the box itself. It had a deep layer of dust covering its exterior. I noticed alot of the wiring were completely exposed with the insulation of the wiring almost completely stripped from the cables. Parts of it looked to be snapped off completely from being chewed on by rats.

“Nest, I don’t think the wiring is even intact enough for it to even work. This place part of the blackout zone?”

“I can see from here it's not. As for power, it's in blackout zone five last I checked. Could be a backup generator that's still running. Look into it after you answer it.”

“Got it”

I said as I picked up the receiver and put it to where my ears would be under the chemical hood. I heard slight static from the other side as I quietly listened for any sound I could pick up.

I could hear someone else listening on the other end just like I was. I considered saying something as the silence only began to sink in further but decided against it. Instead I slowly tapped the receiver a few times with my clunky chemical gloves. 

I knew whatever was on the other side heard it when what I can only describe as a sharp inhale, from something that had greater lung capacity than a human. I heard a voice straining itself like it was trying to speak for the first time. The line went back to muted static again. I kept listening for a few more moments and I could now hear what sounded like the usual kind of music you hear when you get put on hold.

Something about it was wrong at your first listen; it might sound like a normal song. Something you might hear in a mall or an elevator. Maybe some old department store. Unassuming, unremarkable.

The notes that played I quickly took note that some of them were out of tune, some didn’t even sound like they were played correctly. Like it was a song based on someone else’s memory alone.

I looked down at the receiver, staring at the weather worn phone. Still emitting that strange music. I hesitated to hang up yet. Especially since nest was still listening.

“Hang up.” Said nest with a more harsh edge to her voice.

I quietly set the phone back in its place, finally silencing it. I grabbed my handset for my radio. I held down the button to say something but any words I could say refused to leave my mouth. I let the button go as I released my gloved finger.

I started walking again, this time with my free hand on my holster. I suppressed the sound of my heavy winter boots as I best I could while also avoiding stepping on any shards of glass or loose paper. I could tell nest was watching the feed closely.

“Got a floorplan for this place?”
I asked her quietly

“Standby” she said with added professionalism.

I sighed softly and silently wished I was somewhere else. I took out one of my disposable cameras and snapped a few quick photos of my surroundings. Including that strange pay phone. Eventually I heard nest back on the net.

“From what I can there’s a series of maintenance tunnels that lead to some kind of…utility room? Seems large enough to house a generator.”

I softly tapped my rubberized boot for a moment in thought.

“If it was running all this time it should have been out of juice by now”.

Nest was silent for a few moments but I couldn’t tell her finger was on the receiver from the slight static through my hand mic.

“Look into it please, you should be able to get into maints through one of the storefronts.” She replied after a slight pause.

“Got it”. I replied as I shined my light into one of the storefronts.

I got a closer look through the amber beam of my flashlight. Most of the arcade cabinets were still inside. The colorful fonts and vibrant artwork sprawled across the peeling plastic stared indifferently at my form as I gazed inside. The way in was half covered by metal bars. I kneeled down to get a better look inside. Honestly it was in better shape than most of the storefronts in comparison. It seemed like the looters didn’t see much point in ransacking this place, that might not be a good sign.

I crouched in careful not to strike the barred food with any of my gear or my alice pack. The air inside still carried a deathly frigidity to it. Despite being sheltered from much of the wind’s wrath. Even with all of the insulated MOPP gear on, the cold didn’t relent.

I stood up and looked around my weathered surroundings, my footsteps softened on the faded starlike carpet. The beam from my light source reflected off the arcade machine’s screens. Some of them were cracked or had a thin layer of frost covering them. I passed the once colorful prize corner, its cheaply made winnings were still stocked, hardly even touched. As splotchy and worn they were. Not even the looters wanted that shit. I peered around the arcade looking for my way into the tunnels. I finally sighted a set of double industrial doors just past the two racing game machines. The pho double racing seats jutted out from the ultra wide screen of the machine. I passed by the barely legible titles of Dayton USA and Sega Rally as I got closer to the door.

I glanced up at the lightless exit sign that hung above the doorway. My hand grasped the handle and turned it quietly only to find it locked. I took a step back and sent a swift kick into the door. The rusted hinges didn’t offer much resistance as the door flew open to a door hallway. I peeked my head around the corner as the light illuminated clinical white walls, various piping and exposed cables jutted out from the walls. The hallway was silent with even the sound of howling wind not reaching this place.

I trudged forward not exactly eager to continue on, but I resigned myself to do so. Then finally somewhere deep within the darkness beside my vision, I could hear something stirring in the lightless corridor, music, just music. This time it was different from how I heard it on the phone. Loud and clear, no longer strangled by the static of the payphone’s receiver. 

The tone was melodic, probably an older song, with lots of classical instruments. It was soothing almost unnaturally so. Like a lullaby from your childhood, it almost sounded familiar to me. Like something that lingered in the back of my mind, despite how many years had passed. Where have I heard this before?

I switched off the flashlight and stowed it on my webbing. I groped for my dimmer headlamp and turned it on. I unslung the shotgun from over my shoulder and half pumped it to check for the shell’s presence in the chamber.

“Please be careful” I heard nest say with a hint of nervousness in her voice.

I looked down at my handset as she made this remark. She was right. I did need to be careful. I was alone, no one was there to watch my back. No one was there to patch me up or carry me out if I couldn’t make my own way out. If I went down no one was here to carry me to safety. Something could easily leap from the darkness and slit my throat before I even had the chance to fire off a single shell. If I had to run in this heavy gear would I even make it? Even if I dropped my pack. I would drop my only lifeline to the outside world with it. I tightened my grip on my shotgun to keep my hands from shaking.

I took a deep breath as the music echoed in some distant corner of the tunnel. I started carefully moving down the hallway. I held my shotgun close to me, the music only grew louder as I walked deeper into the shadows for what seemed like an eternity.

“Switching to open mic.” I said softly into my radio as I set it to hot mic my every word, I needed my hands free for what came next.  Nest didn’t reply this time.

The hallway finally led to an open doorway. Which proceeded a middling room that seemed to some kind of storage or utility room. Something made me stop dead in my tracks. Two dead bodies lay on the cracked concrete floor in newly made winter clothes. I raised my shotgun as I creeped past the threshold of the doorway. I quickly scanned the room for any kind of threats. I checked my corners. Double checked the doorway behind me to ensure I wasn’t followed here. I did everything by the book. I couldn’t find anything inside minus the bodies.
The utility room seemed to originally house some shelving and circuit breakers but now it seemed to be converted into some kind of makeshift sleeping area of sorts. Two winter sleeping bags were laid out as well as some various other amenities. A kerosene stove, a cooler, and some burnt out flashlights. The floor was covered in torn open bright yellow packaging from handed out HDRs, patriotically colored foil wrappers, stamped on cardboard food packets with half torn American flags and a small bold text that read:

‘food gift from the people of the united states of america.’

‘Nest got two bodies here, look to be vagrants. Gonna look them over.”

“Heard”

I kneeled down beside the first corpse. They were dressed in soaked winter clothes, scarves and all. They were laying face down. I grabbed their shoulders and turned them over. The pale lifeless face of a man in his mid thirties with his eyes wide open stared back at me. The warmth had been completely sapped from his body by the cold air, must have been dead for at least ten hours but it could have been longer. 

I started to cut open the clothes with a pair of trauma shears from my belt to see if I could get a better look at any wounds that could have killed him. I noted quickly I didn’t see any kind of wounds or massive trauma that could have did him in, hell I didn’t even see a single drop of blood on him. If I hadn’t known any better I would have said the cold took him.

The other corpse was in the same state. Ice cold, pale, no wounds, no blood, nothing. The clothes they were wearing should have protected them plenty from hypothermia or frostbite. Even if their clothes got wet. It was almost like they just gave up on living all together. 

I snapped a few pictures of the bodies and the room itself. Nest was still quiet.

“Nest these bodies-” She interrupted me.

“I know just take some samples and-”

Something finally dawned on me, the music had gotten much louder now. Nest had noticed it too. I stood up to stare at where the music was coming from. I waited for it to draw closer beyond the closed doors but it never did.

I slowly approached the door with my shotgun at the ready. I swung the door open only to see utter darkness staring back at me. I shined my headlamp into the darkness, the shadows seemed to swallow the beam from my light. This wasn’t any natural darkness. The music itself seemed to be coming from the shadows themselves, despite the pitch blackness, I could see what seemed to be particles of dust and snow swaying in the air within the symphony. Waves of heat vibrated in the air in that supernatural darkness.
I never thought I would ever get close to one of these. I felt gusts of hot and cold air brush past me. It was mesmerizing honestly, I felt myself go into a small trance, it seemed like I found the source of the strange activity.

“Nest got a positive ID on a musician here”.

“I can see that…what's it doing?”

She inquired as the peaceful music continued to play and echo in the halls. I observed it for a moment before finally replying.

“Its humming”. I replied as I lowered my shotgun.

“Did it kill those two?”
Nest asked me softly.

I looked back over at the two unmoving bodies then back at the musician, gazing at it for a second.

“Unlikely, I don’t see any burns on them.”

As I said this I could hear something different. The fluorescent overhead light tubes began to softly buzz above me. I was sure the power was completely dead besides that phone. My doubts began to fester as they began to flicker on and off.

I felt a pit forming in my stomach as the lights continued to act up. Even the burnt out flashlights nearby began to flicker to life. Nothing about this was right, nothing about this made any sense. I needed to leave and fast.

“N-nest permission to-”

I stopped myself mid sentence. There was another sound. I waited, I listened. I heard it, somewhere close by but I couldn’t tell where. The sound of scrapping metal began to draw near. It almost sounded like it was coming from all around, every angle, every corner. I prepared myself for the task ahead, fighting for my survival. I kept turning and turning trying to point the barrel of my weapon at the source of this sound. 

“Scepter? What's wrong? What do you hear?” She asked with dread seeping into her usually calming voice. I debated telling her that I was cutting the job short and ditching it, but it was probably too late now. 

“Hold traffic”. I said as I curled my finger around the trigger, I waited for anything to move to make itself a target. But it only got quieter, even the musician’s ever present melody fell silent. The only sound I could hear now was the buzzing from the lights above me.
I continued to look around my surroundings. My heart started to beat faster like it was about to burst out of my chest at any moment. I felt sweat begin to build up under my stuffy MOPP suit.

I froze in place, there was only one place I hadn’t checked. Right above me. The musician suddenly blared out a series of notes much louder than before. The walls seemed to vibrate from the volume, it was much different from the song it was humming a few moments ago.

This song was fast paced, suspenseful like something you might hear in a good horror movie. I realized something at that moment, it was warning me. I didn’t have a chance to wonder why as I looked up

What I saw hanging from the ceiling was something I could hardly put into words. Where would I even start with describing what I saw?

My eyes burned when I looked at it, tears began to overtake my vision. The lenses on my gas mask began to fog up.

I could hear my radio crackling with some kind of interference. My trigger felt like it weighed fifty pounds. It was reaching out to me but I quickly noticed it didn’t have any hands. What I remember the most was its misshapen smile or maybe it was a sneer. I couldn’t tell. I finally squeezed the trigger.

I was quickly glad I chose buckshot this time otherwise I probably would have missed. I slam fired two shells into it. I know I hit it but it didn’t stop it. I was confident that it took off an arm if you could call it that. But it did give me just enough time to bolt for the door.

“Class five! Class five!” I yelled into the radio as my hand grasped the doorknob. I swung the door open and slammed it shut behind me

My heavy boots stomped loudly as I took off in a dead sprint down the never ending hallway. I could hardly see where I was going out of the foggy lenses.

“Get the fuck out of there locke!”

I could hear nest scream through the crackling interference of my radio.

That's when I heard those god awful sounds coming from behind me. The door behind bulged as it slammed into it with its endless body. The door began to bend and twist as its writhing appendages reached through the jagged gaps in the door. The sounds it made, like nothing I had ever heard in all my years of being a collector. A deep rumbling murmur shook my surroundings. The sound traveled through my body as this hum only increased in volume. The lights flicked rapidly as they were reanimated. My breathing only increased in rhythm as I reached the double doors back to the arcade. I could hear the sound of the door behind finally giving away as it flew off its hinges and slammed into the ground.
I shoulder checked the next door open, quickly shutting it behind me, thats when I noticed the arcade began to flicker alight. It wasn’t just the lights this time, it was the arcade machines too.

The dusty screens and debris-ridden speakers began to reanimate. Light filled the forgotten arcade, slow and sputtering at first, like something waking up that shouldn’t. Colored bulbs cracked to life one by one, blinking and stuttering like fireflies drowning in static. The machines, long-dead and dust-caked, flickered to their attract modes. Glitched gameplay previews stuttered across the screens, voices warbled through shredded speakers.
One cabinet, deep in the row behind me, let out a warped shriek.
“DAY… TONAAAAA—AA!”
It was blown out, distorted, far too loud for such a hollow space. The sound hit my chest like a shockwave—cheerful, enthusiastic, completely wrong. It echoed through the arcade like something remembering how to be alive, even if it didn’t understand why.
Even through the flashing lights and mechanical noise, I heard it: the door creaking open. The one I knew I had locked.
It slithered. It crawled. It walked—all at once, but never made a sound when it moved. I ducked low behind a row of jammed cabinets, trying not to breathe too loud. My gear felt like dead weight now.
I tried to keep my breathing as quiet as possible even with the adrenaline pumping into my veins. I was hardly able to stand up with how much my legs were shaking.

Even though it didn’t make a sound when it moved. I could still hear a very muffled creak from the floor itself from its mass. It whirred and warbled; it almost sounded like it was mechanical in nature instead of coming from a living thing.

The doorway was close but not close enough for me to make a mad dash for it without it catching up to me before I could crawl back under the barred door.

I slowly reached on my belt for something I had been saving for a rainy day just like this, an incendiary grenade. It felt like it took a lifetime for me to unhook it from my webbing without alerting it to my presence. 

I let my shotgun hang from the sling across my chest as I took off the various safety pins on the grenade. I slowly peeked through a gap between two machines. I could see its massive form almost covering the entire gap. I slowly pied the corner with my finger on the pin of the grenade, ready to pull at any time. I peeked my head around the corner. It wasn’t facing me this time. It was completely still, listening for the smallest sounds.

I twisted and pulled the pin with considerable force. I knew it heard it because it stopped making those god awful sounds. My arms felt heavy as lead. I fought my shaking hands to keep my thumb on the clip to keep it from going off in my hand.

It turned to look at me with that smile that was too wide, too misshapen. That's when I realized, it wasn’t smiling. It just didn’t have any lips for its spiraling maw. Its many eyes stared right into me.

Every single cell of my body screamed at me to run, to hide. I grit my teeth and finally tossed the grenade.
I didn’t know if the live feed was still active, I hoped it was but I know this must have been hard for her to watch but at least she had the common sense to stay quiet while this thing was after me. I felt tempted to turn off the live feed so she didn’t have to watch me get ripped apart by this thing. What little chances I had, lay in that cylinder of thermite. 

The grenade landed right next to it. It glanced over at it with its many independently blinking eyes. That's when it finally went off, first thing I saw was the smoke then the grenade hissing harshly as it released a cone of sparks. The mold covered carpet was the first thing to catch aflame.

I expected to hear it screeching, screaming. Anything but it was silent. Normally alot of these things scream when fire touches them. They hate it more than anything else.

I took my chance and dashed for the doorway as the smoke began to fill the room. I reached the barred door and practically threw my body through the gap. I slammed it shut and made sure it couldn’t be opened this time. My breathing was ragged as I laid on the floor covered in sweat. Smoke had finally claimed the majority of the room, obscuring my view of its interior.

I was about to push myself back up and continue running but something stopped me. An orange glow could be seen through the thick smoke. That's when I saw it, it was still alive. It emerged from the smoke. Its entire form engulfed in flames. That's when I realized how tall it really was. It stooped down to gaze at me. The flames didn’t seem to bother it as its flesh began to char.

I aimed my shotgun at it with my unsteady hands as it continued to stare at me from its side of the barred door. Its lipless maw began to move like it was trying to speak. I was glued to the spot as I could only stare at it with wide eyes as they stinged from looking at it.

Its appendages wrapped themselves around the bar, still staring down at me. I felt thoughts that weren’t my own enter my mind. A single word kept repeating itself over and over again from a voice I never heard in my life.

“Reanimator” It continued to echo in the confines of my skull.

Finally my radio screamed to life once again and I heard nest’s calming voice over the net. She only said one word.

“Run”

This seemed to snap me out of my trance. I pushed myself to my feet and took off down the hallway. The lights around me were flashing wildly as my legs burned from all the gear I was running with. I rounded the corner, entering the main atrium again.

I came to a screeching halt at what I saw next. Everything was back to normal, all the decay, all the disrepair. It was gone. The lights were back, the biting cold air had vanished entirely. The mall wasn’t just repaired, it was alive again. There were people. There were families and groups of teenagers meeting up at the food court after school. All walking by at a leisurely pace for a slow afternoon of shopping, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

The people looked normal enough at first. Nirvana shirts, jeans, the newest kicks. All wearing bright summer wear but I couldn’t see any of their faces. They weren’t missing them entirely, they were fuzzy like trying to take a picture of someone’s face when the camera was out of focus.

They didn’t even seem to notice I was there. Some of them even walked right through me like I was a hologram. I was lost, lost in more ways than I could possibly imagine. I reached for my radio in vain hope that I could still reach nest.

“Nest…can you hear me?”

I desperately wished to hear nest’s nonchalant voice over the net. I could only hear static from the other end, I was truly alone in this mall of ghosts.

The various shop fronts were stocked again. The windows were pristine and undamaged. I could see the out of focus people lazily walking back and forth between the aisles like it was just another day for them. Some of them occupied the colorful seating of the food court and gestured to each other like they were having casual conversations, but the only sounds I could hear from the were indistinct mumblings and murmurs of echoes of human voices. 

Sometimes I missed those days, I missed feeling safe. I missed coming back home to her smiling face. I missed the simple monotony of a nine to five. Hell I even missed those annoying ass jingles they played for ads on daytime TV. I missed it all. I began to wonder if this is where I would spend the rest of my days, wandering in this endless mall. Unseen, unnoticed. Bound to this mockery of normal life.

I trapsed forward not sure where to go at this point besides the exit I came from. I passed the now pristine pay phones. One of them began to ring suddenly. I immediately stopped where I was. 

I sighed softly and slowly walked towards the still ringing phone. That's when I felt a warm hand grasping my shoulder. I turned sharply, bringing my shotgun to bear. Staring back at me was a young woman in her mid twenties. Her face was different from the others, her face was in focus, she had delicate features. Jet black hair with long bangs. She had unnaturally pale eyes.

“You shouldn’t answer that”.

She said in a soft yet firm tone. I ripped free from her gip and backed away from her still aiming my shotgun at her.

“Why not?” I asked in a flat tone.

“You don’t want to know what it will tell you”.

I lowered my shotgun slightly

“It?” I asked not liking where this was going.

“The reanimator”

I was silent for a moment debating on what I should even do at this point.

“Who are you?” I asked warily

She crossed her arms and tilted her head slightly as she regarded me.

“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you”

I opened my mouth to ask her another question but she cut me off.

“No more questions Locke, you need to leave this place.”

“How?” I asked with hesitation, unnerved she knew my name. I know she probably wouldn’t tell me how she knew.

“Same way you came in. you don’t have much time. It's coming. You want to see Lorraine again don’t you?”

My eyes widened as I was stunned into silence. I finally mustered up some words to respond to her. 

“Y..yes”

“Then go” She said with a wave of her hand.

The last thing I saw her do was wink at me before she turned and walked a few steps away from me and her form faded entirely from my vision. 

Then I heard that horrifying yet familiar humming, it was close. I knew I couldn’t hide from it. Fighting it was a losing battle. All I could do was run and pray for my survival. That's exactly what I did at that moment. I ran like I never ran before in my entire life.

The humming was getting closer even as I increased my speed. I finally saw my way out, the doors I took to get inside the mall, now a pristine set of sliding glass doors.
Outside I could see a familiar sight. Snow covered streets, the wreckages of cars, the frozen corpses. I slammed the doors open as I barreled myself outside using the last vestiges of my energy and will to live.

I panted as I continued sprinting into the knee deep snow not caring about the gear getting covered in snow. My radio began to squawk at me as I heard nest’s worried voice over comms.

“Scepter! Scepter come in!”

“I’m here!” I could hear nest sigh in relief from the other end.

“Thank fuck! Your feed cut and I couldn’t reach you.”


I took a deep breath in and out.

“I’m okay…I’m- sorry” I said in between breaths

“No shut up, just…get back safe”

I turned look back at the mall once again, it was in disrepair, ruined, worn down. The neon sign above the doorway that read ‘grover mall’ began to flicker. I cursed under my breath and raised my shotgun to my shoulder.

I saw its body coil itself by the doorway. Its infinite eyes stared back at me as I backed away from the mall. It observed me for a second before it suddenly recessed its measureless form back within the confines of the mall. I don’t know why it didn’t come after me. Nest made one last transmission for awhile

“Okay…the money will be in a dead drop. Pick up is ten minutes away. Nest out.”

I sighed and turned away from that awful place and walked down the treacherous road to await pick up. I always tried to avoid that place when taking contracts. I wish I could say I never did collector work again but I was in no place to quit. I went back to that church. Smoked a couple cigs, stared into the embers of the pastor’s fire and went out to do it all over again, the next day but I never went back to blackout zone five.

My partner and I were in surrey central mall. We were approached by an elderly lady. Well dressed and groomed. She said she needs change for a 100$ bill cause she needed to take the bus home. My partner had a 5$ bill he offered she offered us the 100$ my partner denied the offer and we tried to walk away. She stopped us saying 5$ wasn’t enough she need to take the skytrain to broadway. My partner pulled out a 20$ bill and asked for the 5$ back the lady grabbed the 20$ and said this should be enough. My partner and I found her behaviour odd. But because she was elderly he really wanted to help. A few hours later as my partner and I were exiting the mall I saw the lady with coffee in her hand and I stopped her to ask if she was okay and needed a ride home. She completed ignored me and walked away. This promoted my partner to follow her I caught with them. When we were on the escalator and she couldn’t avoid me further she said “oh you’re the girl that gave me money I don’t need it anymore you can have it back” and I told her no it’s okay I just want to make sure you get home she then explained her son would be picking her up soon. She started asking me if I had a video of her or photos of her I told her no why would I and she started to panic saying don’t take photos of me please. At the time I didn’t understand. My partner had recorded our interaction. I just decided to brush off this incident as odd. Fast forward it’s been a few weeks. One of my friends works in the mall and one of her coworkers was approached by the same elderly lady and because she wanted to help her out this time the lady took 100$. I’m writing this so people are aware. I even have a video of our interaction and if anyone wants to confirm I would share it. But this lady was wearing freshly washed clothes well groomed and brand name purse and clean white sneakers. The lady was well spoken. And it seems as though this is a scam. I wouldn’t want anyone to help her out with their last few dollars. The world’s been a hard place lately. Trusting people seems pretty scary as well.

She had asked how my week was, and I was venting about someone the people had been getting on my nerves that week.  Nothing specifically had happened, I just work in close quarters with 3 other people and it had been a bit since any of us had a break from each other.

Well, my friend, who doesn't work with me or know anyone I work with, started trying to give me advice on how to deal with my coworkers.

Honesty, I usually get along with my coworkers pretty well, it had just been a long couple of weeks.  Which, I tried to explain to her, but everything I said she just had another 'suggestion' for how I should deal with it.

Again, she doesn't know any of them or anything about where I work, other than what I have told her.

So after a while I had had enough and just told her that I wasn't asking for her advice on how to deal with my coworkers.  She had asked me how my week was, and I had told her.

I don't really regret saying it.  This friend in particular doesn't really seem great at reading social cues, and won't stop until you either agree with her, or validate what she's saying.  I have in the past just to get her to stop, but my nerves were already frazzled and I just didn't want to deal with it anymore.

I know she thinks she is being supportive, or helpful, but she just comes across as pushy.

My girlfriend has a lot of intrusive nightmares of me cheating on her, especially with her friends. Of her many fears, me cheating is pretty high on that list. So the other day, I visited the coffee shop I frequent and there’s a new employee, she seems around 20. I go to irder and ask her if a certain drink has pecans in it because my girlfriend’s allergic. She responds yes and then asks if she’s allergic to all nuts in An overly enthusiastic way (I later realized she was flirting). While waiting for my drink, I overheard her and another employee joke about her last name and it made me chuckle (it was something like McCocner). She asked what I was laughing at and I responded nothing in a joking way.

Later, we visit the same coffee shop this time with my girlfriend. The girl at the coffee shop is acting a lot weirder now, flirtatiously saying “I’m still mad at you” to me and not acknowledging my girlfriend’s existence. I felt very uncomfortable and sort of shut down, not responding to what she said. She double charged my GF for drinks and gave her a drink with pecans knowing well she was allergic to them. I am incredibly horrible and confrontation and feel kind of like a turtle hiding in its shell. My girlfriend believes my lack of confrontation and shutting her down was cheating and I am not sure what to do.

She’s not worried that I wanted to flirt back or anything, she’s just incredibly angry with me for letting it go on and not defending her. I wrote a script for next time I’m in a situation like this because how much I struggle with confrontation.

I love her very much and I worry she won’t be able to get past this. I know it hurts her so badly because of her intrusive thoughts, but I also know that I will probably fail to shut it down if it happens again in the future unless something changes.. I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to proceed from here. Part of me wants to storm into the coffee shop and shut her down like I should have already and leave a scathing review on google. The other part of me just wants to hide and never go there again. Idk I’m confused and upset and really hate how hard my GF is taking it. Any advice would be appreciated <3

1p3mzos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1p3mzos/kid_keeps_knocking_at_door/,Kid Keeps Knocking at Door,"Sorry in advanced for formatting, I’m on mobile. 

As the title says. My child (7) has a friend from school (7) who it seems is being told to leave the house and play, and don’t come back until 5:30pm. 

He came to my house after school and just didn’t leave, I asked if his nan knows where he is, he said she told him to stay out until 5:30. 
The kids get bored and I send them outside, then they get bored and start running around the road. I took them to the playground where it’s safe to run and play. 
My child and I went home at 5:30. 
The next day the same thing happens and again, we end up at the playground until 5:30. 

Today is Saturday. Child knocked on my door at 8:30am. We didn’t answer the door as we had just woken up, having coffee and breakfast etc. so child helps himself into my front yard (it’s walled off with an entrance) and starts playing with my child’s toys. 
My child went outside to play and I told them they could have 15 minutes but then my child will be busy and will no longer be able to play. Easy, all goes well, kid leaves. 

15 minutes later, child is back. I said we are busy, child leaves, 10 minutes later child is back. Gives my child a walkie talkie and leaves. 
We then need to go to the shop. 
We walk to my car and child comes back again. I said we are going now you need to go home. 

We get back from shops, walk into the door, and 2 minutes later the child is back. I said we are busy I’m sorry you need to go home. Child leaves, 15 minutes later child is back again. I didn’t answer the door this time, so again goes into my yard and starts playing. 
I went outside and said you need to go home now, we’re busy and can’t play. We won’t be answering the door anymore if you come again. Child leaves, but 10 minutes later is back again. 

This continues another 4 times. By the last time my husband and child had gone out, my mother in law was here and told him you need to go home now we will see you at school on Monday.  I’m not confident he won’t be back though. 

What do I do? Do I tell the school this is happening? Will they care? My heart hurts, I feel so bad for this child but I really am busy, I haven’t been getting anything done as I’ve been constantly supervising these children, I work during the week and I’m fine with my child having play dates but this is too much.

👏👏👏Today I visited a coffee shop in Niigata's Akiha Ward. It has a very relaxing atmosphere with chill background music, housed in a converted farm equipment shed. They serve specialty coffee here. While many specialty coffee shops in urban areas are great, this place offers high-quality coffee at a low price. It's incredibly smooth, and both the hot and iced versions are absolutely delicious. It completely changes your perception of coffee. For coffee lovers, it's an absolute must-try spot you won't be able to resist.

1p3mypm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3mypm,How to visualize anything with AI: A masterclass on Gemini's new physics-aware infographic engine with Nano Banana Pro in Gemini,"# The Guide: Mastering Infographics with Nano Banana Pro

TL;DR: Google's new Nano Banana Pro (built on Gemini 3) has solved the biggest headache in AI art: Text & Layout. Unlike Midjourney or DALL-E, it uses a ""Reasoning Engine"" to plan data placement and checks facts via Google Search before drawing. I generated 20 complex infographics (attached) to prove it. This post breaks down exactly how it works, why it's different, and the specific prompt structures I used to get these results.

We’ve all been there. You ask an AI for an infographic and it gives you a beautiful image full of alien gibberish text and charts that make zero mathematical sense.

**Enter Nano Banana Pro (Powered by Gemini 3).**

I’ve been pushing this model to its absolute limit, and I’m convinced it’s a paradigm shift for designers, marketers, and data nerds. It doesn't just hallucinate pixels; it **plans** the layout and **verifies** data before rendering.

I’ve attached 20 examples ranging from **""The Singularity Roadmap""** to **""The Hidden City Infrastructure""**. Here is how you can do this too.

# 🍌 What is Nano Banana Pro?

Nano Banana Pro is the nickname for Google's latest image generation model built on the **Gemini 3** architecture. While previous models were just diffusion models (guessing pixels), this is a **Reasoning Image Engine**.

**Why it kills for Infographics:**

1. **Spatial Reasoning:** It simulates the logic of the scene. It understands that ""1950"" comes before ""2024"" on a timeline, or that the ""crust"" is above the ""mantle"" in a geological diagram.
2. **Google Search Grounding:** It can pull real-time data. If you ask for a Weather Infographic, it can actually look up current weather patterns to inform the visuals (though you should always double-check the stats!).
3. **Native 4K Text:** It renders crisp, legible text in multiple languages, even for dense labels.

# ⚙️ How It Works (The Reasoning Engine)

When you ask for a ""Cross-section of a city,"" standard models look at pixels of other cross-sections and guess. Nano Banana Pro appears to construct a logical ""skeleton"" of the image first using Gemini 3's reasoning capabilities. It calculates the layout, ensures the text fits, and *then* paints the pixels.

# Pro Tips & Best Practices

**1. The ""Data-First"" Prompt Structure** Don't just say ""Make an infographic about coffee."" You need to feed the reasoning engine. Use this structure:

* **Topic:** ""Infographic about \[Topic\]""
* **Data Context:** ""Use real-world data for \[Year\] regarding \[Subject\].""
* **Visual Style:** ""Cyberpunk neon / Isometric 3D / Vintage parchment / Clean corporate flat.""
* **Layout:** ""Use a Roadmap flow / Treemap layout / Cross-section cutaway.""

**2. Use ""Sketch-to-Image"" (Multimodal Input)** This is the killer feature. Draw a terrible boxy sketch on a piece of paper showing where you want the title and the charts. Upload that to Gemini with the prompt: *""Turn this sketch into a high-fidelity infographic about \[Topic\]. Maintain this exact layout but make it look like a \[Style\].""*

**3. Aspect Ratio is King** Infographics often fail because they are cramped.

* **Mobile/Social:** Prompt for `9:16` (Vertical). Great for ""Roadmaps"" (like my Singularity example).
* **Desktop/Print:** Prompt for `16:9` (Horizontal). Great for ""Timelines"" or ""World Maps.""

**4. Iterative Editing** Nano Banana Pro allows for region-based editing. If one statistic is wrong:

* Highlight the text area.
* Prompt: *""Change text to '50 Billion' instead of '50 Million'.""*
* It renders the text perfectly in the same font style without warping the rest of the image.

# Style Breakdown (Based on my Examples)

* **The Roadmap (See ""Singularity Roadmap""):**
   * *Prompt Keyword:* ""Curved timeline, glowing nodes, progression from left to right, distinct eras.""
* **The Cutaway (See ""Hidden City"" & ""Into the Abyss""):**
   * *Prompt Keyword:* ""Cross-section view, underground layers, depth markers (0m to 10,000m), educational labels.""
* **The Treemap (See ""Wealth Infographic""):**
   * *Prompt Keyword:* ""Bento grid layout, rectangular blocks sized by value, distinct color coding per category.""
* **The Dashboard (See ""One Day of Internet""):**
   * *Prompt Keyword:* ""HUD style, central globe, surrounding circular widgets, data streams, neon borders.""

We are moving from Prompt & Pray to ""Prompt & Plan. With Gemini 3's reasoning, you can now visualize complex articles, business reports, or study notes instantly with high factual and spatial accuracy.

* Guides that are easier to read than dense textbooks
* Materials I personally used to pass

I've been very depressed lately and I'm really hoping someone can give me some advice or just comfort.Any help is appreciated.

Im 26 currently attending universities and living in LA.Almost ten years after coming to the US I'm still accomplishing nothing, studying in a major that's just for a degree. My father left the family not to live together anymore for some reason. My mom can only work low wage jobs because of her English.Our family isn't doing so well financially right now and I'm trying to work part time and do everything I can to make her happy.But I can still feel her sadness for various reasons.I'm so tired from messing around with my full-time studies (18unit) and part-time job, and what's even harder for me is the mental exhaustion.I really don't know if my little family will be able to improve their lives and get mental health relief after I graduate. I change girlfriends almost every three days.I date a lot of girls because of stress, I date some girls on instagram, I'm even in coffee stores I hit on other girl.I thought about how the crazy sex would relieve my stress but I still woke up in the morning feeling suffocated when I faced reality.I admit that I don't need to worry about my looks indeed there are a lot of girls who will like my looking but I'm still upset. I'd rather my mom be happier every day and I'd rather have a loving family. My family atmosphere is very sad and I can only now realize how desirable a loving family is. 

I really don't know what to do about the future of my family. I would love to change this family and I want my mom to have a better life. I should consider Should I change my major? Or become a soldier? ME. Or hold out as long as I can until I graduate and get a full-time job?

Whether it's any advice or reassurance or just a simple chat, I appreciate it, thank you to everyone in the community, and I wish you sweet dreams and a great weekend!

I'm looking for a roommate to sign a lease with for 2 bed,  2 bath,  budget $3K (hopefully including utilities, but I have wiggle room if utilities aren't included).

Looking to live in the Telegraph Hill, North Beach, Nob Hill, Russian Hill, Bayside Village, FiDi, or Rincon Hill areas (can also probably do Mission Rock, Mission Bay, or Dogpatch).

Things I value:

* in-unit laundry
* close to work (I work near FiDi/Chinatown)
* close to gym/place has a gym

  
About me:

* 25M, working at a startup
* M-F, I'll probably barely be around (I work in office like 10 am - 10 pm ish)
* On weekends, I like to sleep in, go to the gym or on walks/hikes, explore the city, eat out at new places, read, or binge a show
* Happy to socialize as little or as much as you'd like
* I live very cleanly and hire a cleaner once a month to clean my space (down to split the cost to clean the whole place too)
* Very doubtful that I will ever be cooking
* I don't need parking, so if the place comes with parking, you're welcome to have it
* I live quietly and don't expect to have many guests
* I rarely ever drink, but I'm ok if you do
* 420 friendly (but please don't stink up the place)
* LGBTQ+ friendly
* pet friendly (I love pets! don't have any of my own though)
* great credit (750+) and income meets the usual 3x rent requirement, ready to sign a lease if we vibe well

  
What I'm looking for in a roommate (all things I would do/be myself):

* Lives cleanly and relatively quietly - someone who values a neat, tidy, and peaceful place to live
* respectful, non-problematic, communicative, and easy going (I'm happy to take constructive feedback on how I am as a roommate, and I hope you'll do the same)
* guests are fine, but hopefully it's not an ""all the time"" thing
* doesn't smoke cigarettes (the smell is not it for me, makes me queasy)
* will share chores like taking out the trash
* doesn't leave their laundry in the in-unit machine for days
* fine w/ roommate of any gender identity

  
I think that covers all the bases! If I missed anything, I'm happy to answer any follow-ups in the comments. If you're interested, send me a DM and let's meet for a meal, boba, coffee, drink, video chat, etc., or something to get to know each other before making a decision!

Hopefully the post didn't come off as too ""Type A"" or anything like that, I swear I'm easygoing & chill, I just wanted to provide all the relevant information that came to mind (ik if I have to say this it's generally not a good look lol, but you'll see when we meet, trust.

costs about 50 a month but honestly worth it for the time back

setup took me most of saturday figuring out how to describe what i wanted from each site. you basically tell it in plain english what to grab instead of writing selectors. not super intuitive at first but got it working

1p3mlri,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1p3mlri/come_check_out_my_new_aizawa_x_oc_fanfic/,Come check out my new Aizawa x OC fanfic!,"I've been writing this fic since COVID, so over five years of planning and writing! I currently have 5 chapters posted with new chapters every/every other Wednesday.

The story goes between Aizawa's POV and the main character's, while focusing on my OC, Katsumi. It's called [Siren's Call](https://archiveofourown.org/works/73763341/chapters/192349376) on AO3 by queen\_eira.

The story follows as Katsumi and Aizawa fall for each other (slowburnnn) while Katsumi deals with the haunting of her past and realizes she will have to face not only her past, but what she has done, and who she is. She tries her best to keep her relationship with Aizawa and her friendships along the way.

Definitely read the tags, as this fic can get dark, but there will be a happy ending! It involves villain Deku, Bakugo getting help/'adopted' by Katsumi, and Shinsou 'adopted' by Aizawa (and both adopt Eri), >!as well as an interesting tie to the league of villains???!<

Also to note, Katusmi's Quirk involves singing. She often sings her emotions as well (backstory on that in fic) and is more powerful if she sings her emotions/connects to the song while using her Quirk. I have actual lyrics in the story (properly credited and not whole songs, just bits and pieces that are important). You don't need to listen to the music, but I think it enhances the story. If not, the most important lyrics will be in writing.

Here is a snippet of one of the future chapters!! Fair warning, it involves a panic attack.

>!*Before long, it was the night before the festival. Katsumi had kept her panic stomped down in her mind, and didn’t think too hard about the next day. But when she woke up in the middle of the night, almost yelling as she sobbed, she couldn’t help but pay attention to it.*!<

>!*Her nightmare, half dream, half memory, of him, and what he did to her, plagued her mind. Her chest constricted. She could barely breathe as she sobbed into her hands. The shadow appeared next to her, touching her arm and rubbing her back, but it did little to comfort her. A storm raged on outside, her room momentarily lighting up before it would darken, and a loud boom outside shook the walls and her body.*!<

>!*Katsumi was shaking, her stomach dry heaved a few times at how hard she was crying, but no matter what she did, what she thought of, she couldn’t come down from the pure, unfiltered panic she was in. Her hands went over her arms and face and into her hair. She tugged at the ends, trying to will her mind to be at ease, but it only got worse.*!<

>!*The woman began to mumble to herself, listing all the good things in her life, listing the people in her life who cared for her, but as soon as those words left her chapped lips, they were drowned out by the pelting of the rain.*!<

>!*The shadow looked helpless in her vision. It sat on her bed, eyes wide with worry, before it took her hand and helped her to stand. Her mind was too full to realize what it was doing, so she just followed along. It tugged her out of her room and to the door of the adjacent room. Aizawa’s room. The figure knocked on the door and cracked it open. It gave Katsumi an encouraging look before it disappeared.*!<

>!*Katsumi, not knowing what else to do, opened the door and took a single step in. She could see a dark figure lying in the large bed. Her tears fell faster now as pain radiated in her arm. She looked down to find her nails feverishly scratching at the skin. When did that happen? She didn’t remember starting this old habit of hers, but she couldn’t seem to stop.*!<

>!*“Sho-Sho…Shouta?” She cried into the darkness. Another flash lit up the room as a groan emanated from the bed. It darkened, and the figure sat up.*!<

>!*“Katsumi?” He asked, groggily. His voice was laced heavily with sleep. “What’s wrong?”*!<

>!*She took another step into the room, the door closing behind her. Her legs were weak, threatening to collapse beneath her. She took in a gasping breath, her cries becoming more violent. Aizawa took his blankets off, quickly getting up and approaching her. “Talk to me, Katsumi, what happened?”*!<

>!*His voice was tender, holding a type of sweetness Katsumi wanted to hold onto. It calmed her enough to begin talking. “I-I had a, I had, had a nightmare, and, and…he was, wa-was… he found m-me,” She stammered, barely able to complete a single sentence. Aizawa shushed her and put a hand on her back, guiding her to his bed. She let him and wobbled over.*!<

>!*Katsumi slumped into the mattress, crying into her hands as Aizawa sat next to her. He gently moved her legs under the sheets and got her to lie down. He pulled the covers over them and then pulled her in. Katsumi let him, too emotionally raw to pull away or go back to her room. She needed his comfort, craved his comfort. So, when he pulled her in, she latched on, wrapping her arms around him as she pressed her face into his shirt. Her tears and saliva dampened his shirt, but it didn’t seem like he cared.*!<

>!*The hero rubbed her back, his arms around her as he pulled her into a tight hug to his chest. As much as he could, at least, with his still wounded arms. “It’s okay, he can’t get to you, you’re safe,” he murmured into her hair.*!<

>!*Shame piled into Katsumi’s gut. Shame of her weakness, shame of disturbing her friend’s sleep, shame of him having to comfort her, and shame of her feelings. His body was warm and welcoming. He smelled good, like lavender and coffee with a hint of whiskey, which caused her body to relax a bit. She felt safe in his arms, safer than she had in her entire life. She cried harder because of the relief.*!<

>!*Her friend began whispering to her. He talked of the students and how much she meant to them. How much Hizashi loved her and already viewed her as one of his close friends. But most of all, he talked about how safe she was, and how much he came to care for her. It was soothing her nerves, the panic beginning to ebb away. She clutched onto him, scared that if she let him go, this would all end up being a dream.*!<

>!*Slowly, Katsumi began to calm down. Her breathing was still erratic, but the more Aizawa whispered to her, the more he rubbed her back and held her, the more her heart and mind eased. She gripped his shirt in her hands, not wanting to leave his side, and he didn’t seem to mind it. He reassured her that he was here for her, that he wasn’t going to leave her side.*!<

>!*The raw emotions she felt suddenly exhausted her. Her outburst seemed to have made her drowsy. She began to doze off. Before her mind fully quieted and she was lulled to sleep, she could’ve sworn she felt him press a soft kiss to the top of her head, but that must’ve been the beginning of a lovely dream.*!<

I'm a little hesitant to post here but I think it is the case with all of the students. I'm also a student , in my 3rd years and I have to travel a lot because of studies and I also love travelling. But every time I find myself searching on Google 'is this place safe to go' and I end up with generic reviews and years old threads. There is not a single method to know is place is actually safe and should I visit. This is the case with almost all students who leave their home town for studies.

I remember during my first year I skipped plans because most of my friends were day scholars and I don't want to come back my pg alone . I was so literally so frustrated and have to come back to my pg before 7 most of the times. Every time I want to explore somewhere new or plan a trip, it's the same anxiety: checking five different sources, asking random people, still not knowing for sure. I don't have a big friend group just me and my 2 friends and that's why it still a problem for us!

**Here's what I realized:** nobody tracks the information that actually matters for solo travelers especially women. Not which cafe has good coffee, but whether you'll get harassed walking there alone at 7 PM.

Therefore I'm building a product called Safe or Not, it is a very simple product just type in the location and get women safety, transit safety etc. reviews from crowdsource data. You also have access to latest scams and recent news so you don't have to juggle between posts.

Is this messed up?”","I (21M) used to go to school with two twin sisters a couple years ago, Twin A and Twin B. We were all classmates for about 3 years.

Back then I was super quiet, shy, and honestly not confident at all.

I always liked Twin A first. She was sweet, calm, had this smile that would literally make my whole day. Nothing big happened though, I never had the guts to ask her out.

Fast forward to last year (2024):
I ended up reaching out to Twin B instead, not because she was my first choice, but because at the time she was the one still in my life. Twin A, left our school. I thought maybe something could happen. I sent her a message asking if she’d be interested in grabbing coffee.

She turned me down politely.
She was really kind about it, said she was focusing on her med school applications and career for now, wished me the best. No drama. Just a clean, respectful rejection.

Now here’s where I’m stuck:

It’s been almost a year since I asked Twin B out.
I haven’t seen Twin A in almost two years.
I’ve worked on myself a lot since then, confidence, life stability, routine, everything.

And I still think about her.

Not in a weird obsessive way, just… she left a mark on me. She genuinely inspired me to improve my life. And part of me regrets not asking her out when we were all in school together.

So here’s my dilemma:

Is it wrong or weird to reach out to Twin A a year after Twin B rejected me?

Some people online say “never date siblings,” some say it doesn’t matter because nothing happened between me and Twin B at all. No flirting or nothing, just warm friendly interactions. I literally only asked her out once. It wasn’t a crush, a fling, nothing.

But I don’t want Twin A to feel like a second choice, because she wasn’t. She was the one I liked originally, I was just too shy back then.

If I reached out is that disrespectful? Or is it normal since Twin B and I never dated or went beyond a single coffee invite?

Has anyone been in a situation like this?

1p3mcwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p3mcwl/sexless_relationship_and_feeling_more_alone_than/,Sexless Relationship and Feeling More Alone than Ever,"It's going on 4 years without sex, and I'm starting to really struggle with being happy in life. Sex was never an issue in previous relationships (in fact I knew my marriage had indeed gotten bad when our arguing/disagreements had gotten to the point where we had stopped having sex). My first (short-term) relationship post divorce was heavily sex-based - I think I had it in the back of my mind  that we weren't really compatible long term, but I needed to feel desired and wanted, and he was all about that. That ended, then came another short term, and then I met the man I'm still with today.....the one who's kind, smart, interesting....and who suddenly stopped touching me after about 1 1/2 years together.

His sex drive, admittedly, wasn't as high as mine, but I accepted that. But then the excuses started - my son had moved in and so it was a new living situation (despite the fact that at that point, we hadn't had sex for over 6 months); he wanted to lose some weight (despite his weight not being a problem); apparently all I wanted from him was sex, not an actual relationship (despite everything to the contrary); he was going to  have sex but I ruined that idea with my attitude (this seemed to always coincidentally happen when I would get ornery after another few months of nothing).

He still likes to hold hands and kiss goodnight, but that's about it. Doesn't respond to me as a sexual being (I needed his help to zip up a dress, nothing. I'll be dancing to music at home, seemingly no interest. I love saying double entendres, nothing). I've brought up that we're essentially roommates, and he gets mad - says that's bs. Oh, and another thing - we're in this together, making that life together, one on one relationship, yet, he doesn't say ""I love you."" Says that it's just words, and him buying a house that I wanted is proof enough of his love. As anyone who has ever been divorced can attest, sure, those three words are certainly not a guarantee, but I've told him that I still love hearing those words....and yep, nothing. So I don't say it to him, and that's also another thing incredibly hard for me to deal with - not hearing it, and not saying it. 

Like many in this situation, I stay because well, I do have a nice home, he's given me a nice life otherwise, and I don't have enough money to start over again. I fell in love with him, but now, painfully, not sure anymore. And I feel like I'm dying inside because of no longer being who I was, who I always was. I haven't had sex since entering menopause (which I was lucky enough to not experience any problems with), and that's making it worse - I no longer have to worry about oops moments, obsessing over the calendar, a hot night delayed because my period came early....and I constantly question why.

I've become that cliched bitter angry woman, who maybe wouldn't be such a b\*tch if she got some. I cry - a lot of anguish and anger. It's painful to watch sex scenes on TV and in movies, and I'm not even talking about anything explicit. It  could just be a scene of kissing that implies sex, and it hurts.

He's not cheating, and not watching porn. Had his testosterone levels checked, and fine. I've brought up possibly exploring an open relationship, but he considers that cheating (even if the only thing I would be looking for would be sex, just to have that need met). I've brought up that what's killing me is not solely the lack of sex, but not even fooling around, making out. And he just keeps making excuses. No surprise, I no longer sleep in the bedroom.

I'm desperate for touch....I'm actually a bit afraid of how I would react if someone did touch me, it's been so long. I lost a lot of friends from moving, so on top of all of this, don't go out with anyone, even just for coffee. I feel like I'm losing my mind, on the verge of a breakdown. Not having sex because I'm single, that's one thing. Choosing to not have sex, that's also understandable. Had he been injured or ill, also understandable. But pretty much being forced into this, by someone who seems to be the right one in every aspect but sex......

I should also add that he's in his early 50's, drinks a lot, and seems to be more and more embracing an old man lifestyle (And I feel like that assessment is insulting to older men). Meaning he has to take a 2 hour, 2 hour plus nap every day, goes to bed relatively early, and doesn't have much interest in doing things. I know I can't party like I did in my 20's, but soooo not ready to just call my life over. I'm terrified this is the rest of my life, that I'll never have sex again, never know again what it feels like to have someone tell me how much they want me, just never have all of that ever again. That my memories of sex with exes is what stays alive in my head....

Self-pleasure can only do so much, and yes, it's important to be happy with yourself, love yourself.....but not even being caressed.....not hearing sexy little come-ons.....not a single shred of lust, desire, want.......I'm so tired of feeling alone.

I’m going to be brave here and would love to connect with people since I’m new to this community. I’m trying to overcome the feeling of being unworthy to reach out and make friends / chat because I’m married to a hetero man (sexless relationship for 5 years, feels like more of a friendship now than companionship). Anyways, I guess I’m craving connection. 

A little bit about me: I work in the hair industry, go to the gym 5 times a week and enjoy hitting fitness goals. I’m obsessed with my two dogs, definitely a coffee addicted astrology girlie, and I love to laugh/deep conversation. Some of my (famous) hobbies including:
-  working 14 hours then wondering why my back hurts. 
- telling my dogs “no, you’ve already had too many snacks”, then giving them a whole ass carrot each anyways because I taught them how to smile and now they know if they smiles, I melt into a 4 ft 11 pile of confetti.
- winding down my car window at 2am whilst driving home from gym to tell the neighbour hood cats to go home because it’s late! Literally followed one yesterday night until she jumped over her fence (don’t think I don’t know where you Mittens!)

[Bronze Age Warfare: screenshot from the real-time battles in the video game A Total War Saga: Troy](https://preview.redd.it/uzx532od5r2g1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4eda831cd31238be360845e9d8131f569ad79def)

When considering the collapse of the Bronze Age civilisations in the Near East, historians tend to neglect the role of a group of people who had emerged over a period of a thousand years into a significant power in their own right, the maritime traders and the merchants who operated and controlled the overland routes.

**The Palace-Temple Economy Model**

A palace economy is a centralised economic system where a sizeable portion of wealth is controlled by a governing authority, often a monarch or priestly class. This central body, referred to as the ""palace,"" redistributes resources to the population, which may rely heavily on this distribution. Historically, this system was justified by the belief that the palace was best equipped to efficiently allocate resources for the benefit of the society. A similar concept is the temple-state economy.

Essentially, a palace economy involves centralised planning and control. The governing body determines production, assigns labour, collects output, and redistributes it. This system often operates within a physical complex, such as a palace or temple, where economic activities are concentrated.

***Accumulating Wealth and Power***

While ostensibly serving the population, the palace's primary goal is typically to accumulate wealth and power. This wealth can be used for various purposes, including trade, investment in infrastructure, military expansion, and diplomatic alliances.

***Through Servitude***

In many ancient palace economies, the workforce was tied to the palace through servitude or patronage. The palace provided basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter in exchange for labour. Economic growth often relied on military conquest, with plunder and captured labour contributing to the palace's resources.

***And Warfare***

All Bronze Age elites realized the downsides of warfare. Warfare is a non-productive policy, costly to both the aggressor and defender in terms of materials, resources, and manpower. The aims of a Bronze Age aggressor were base, to increase their wealth and stock of necessities by plundering the defender. Their secondary aim was to increase their population tax base by taking captives or taking control of a population centre along with its rural outskirts. In the latter case, warfare often resulted in a decimated city and a ruined hinterland lacking sufficient urban or rural population to rejuvenate itself. Each city state and later, empire or kingdom, had to maintain a defence force of one form or another, to deter and, when necessary, defend, the homeland, itself a huge expense.

***And Trade***

The only way to bring new wealth to an area, as opposed to recirculating existing wealth through hostile acquisition, was through the mechanism of trade. In order to trade, a palace temple had to produce a surplus of something that it could then exchange for goods it either needed, or exotic items that would enhance the status of the elite (and to a lesser extent, the producers) or be used for further trade and exchange.

All the early palace temples began life as nexus of trade, market towns in effect, situated at strategic locations. Some developed into city states and then further to full palace temples.

***Emerging Merchant Class***

The merchant class became an essential component of these urban centres. It was they who organised the trade of goods from far off places, arranged the finance to conduct that trade, communicated with trusted partners across the known world, transported the products and arranged for the sale or exchange at either end of the road.

The merchant trader, by necessity, was cosmopolitan, able to transact business across many city states, palace temples, kingdoms and empires some of which, at times, were hostile to each other. They became almost a nation unto themselves, an invisible force without which the Bronze Age empires and kingdoms could not have been built.

***The Impact of the 4.2k yr BP Drying Event***

It is noticeable that early palace temples were more altruistic than later and the boundary between the two can roughly be equated to the onset of the 4.2k yr. BP drying event, that affected many parts of the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East for between two and three hundred years, centred on 2200 BC.

The days of elites storing food during the good times and distributing it to those in need during the tough times disappeared. The 'modern' palace was an extractive institution that gained its wealth from taxes on trade goods, agricultural products, estates, compulsory labour, and turning raw materials into desirable commodities for export.

Some Bronze Age rulers found it expedient to gather wealth through raids on neighbouring city states and later, palace-temples and later still the kingdoms and empires that had evolved. The booty so gained would frequently include captives, particularly skilled craftspeople, as well as foodstuffs and the usual precious metals and stones.

***Growth of Urban Communities***

The urban communities that grew around these elite figures tended to concentrate on the plains and steppes. They depended on the pastoral communities that lay beyond in the surrounding hills and mountains for milk products and wool. Some of these lowland communities grew to become cities covering a hundred hectares with populations well into five figures but the norm was a medium to small town with a few thousand inhabitants and a correspondingly smaller administrative centre. Some of the cities were located near a coast and had a port within their orbits, a scenario that became synonymous with the Mediterranean.

***And Palace Temples***

In a remarkably short space of time these urban centres sprouted palaces and, to affirm the link between the ruling elite and the gods, temples. Palace-temples in the largest cities could be as large as a small village.

***Inflationary Influences***

The palaces and temples became 'sink holes' for necessities as well as incoming wealth. The accumulation and storage of precious raw materials created an inflationary demand for those materials and the deposition of the same materials in elaborate elite graves removed them from circulation altogether, thus perpetuating the inflationary cycle.

***The First Entrepreneurs***

Although the palace-temple system was autocratic, the rule of the elites was not total. Away from the city hub there was still room for entrepreneurial activity, some of which was taxed, but much of which went on below the radar, just the sort of environment an entrepreneurial merchant can exploit. Barter on a local scale ensured the survival of the peasant farmers.

Ebla was an early palace temple of which we know quite a bit due to the recovery of 17,000 cuneiform tablets dated to between 2400 BC and 2300 BC.

**The Palace-Temple Economy of Ebla 3500 BC to 1600 BC**

Ebla was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria and was situated about 55 kilometres southwest of present day Allepo. Ebla became an important trade centre and its kingdom, gained by conquest or purchase of surrounding autonomous towns and villages, and strategically arranged marriages, eventually covered an area of 10,000 square kilometres, larger than even the Nile Delta or Cyprus. The Kingdom of Ebla included more than sixty vassal kingdoms and city-states, including Hazuwan, Burman, Emar, Halabitu and Salbatu.

The first Eblaite kingdom has been described as the first recorded world power (Samuel Finer and Karl Moore), and reached its peak about 2340 BC. It was bounded to the west by coastal city states, to the south by small city states along the Orontes river, and to the north and east by Mari and other major polities on the Euphrates.

***The Ebla Tablets***

During its partial excavation, over 17,000 cuneiform tablets, written in a local west Semitic language and Akkadian, cover the period 2400 BC to about 2300 BC. They record trade agreements, administration of the palace economy, politics and elite intermarriage with other polities.

The kings of Ebla had contacts with neighbouring kings, notably the powerful sovereigns of Mari and Nagar, and with the kings of more distant regions, like Kish in Mesopotamia and Hamazi in western Iran. Excavations at Ebla have uncovered the oldest example of a written peace treaty, the treaty between Ebla and Abarsal (this could be the same city-state as Aburru, mentioned in the Mari texts), as well as proof of matrimonial alliances between the local kings and certain of their allies.

From the tablets, it appears that the kings of Ebla allowed councils and assemblies to make policy decisions and that access to those councils was less constricted. The Ebla kings were also less powerful and self-glorifying in art and literature than their contemporaries. Similarly, the temples in Ebla, though substantial, were less grand than others in the Mesopotamian arena.

***The economy of Ebla***

The economy was based on large scale cereal farming with vines and olives on higher ground. The elite were not shy in awarding vast tracts of land to their supporters; one queen of Ebla is recorded as giving a priestess land with 16,320 units of olives, 8,800 units of sowable land, 630 units of vineyard.

Tens of thousands of sheep supplied wool to a textile industry mostly owned by the royal family and elites, altogether a few hundred people. Most of the products of industry were for export to other city states and polities, Mari was a major market for goods from Ebla, the remainder went to the elite, and filtered down through their retainers and servants. One of the perhaps unanticipated consequences was that the Ebla fashions of the time, dress and jewellery, took on a distinctly 'palace' look.

***Daily activity in Ebla***

The archives also give us a view of daily activities. At any one time, 800 women were weaving, grinding cereals and cooking, 500 smiths, 150 carpenters, 35 physicians, 30 musicians, and 14 barbers all supported by handouts from the palace.

***Of silver and gold***

But it was trade in metals that brought in the greatest rewards. Silver was the value standard at the time with gold at Ebla being worth between two and five times that of silver, and copper about one twentieth the value of silver.

According to the archives, forty-five kilograms of gold and between two hundred and fifty and four hundred and fifty kilogrammes of silver passed through the palace on an annual basis with the largest shipments being 1.5 tonnes. Some of the silver and gold came from the peasant farmers who were expected to pay their taxes in metallic form, a clear indication that primary products such as corn, and manufactured products such as textiles, had a relevant metallic value, but most silver and gold came from trade. Ebla played the metal commodities market and was advantageously placed between Egypt, Mesopotamia and Anatolia to do so. In Mesopotamia the value of silver to gold was 10:1 and in Egypt the ratio was 1:2 to 1:1.35.

Ebla became what is termed a 'palace-temple economy', an economic model that would become common across the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East.

***Ebla in ruins***

Between c 2400 BC and 2290 BC, Ebla was destroyed. There are various theories involving Sargon of Akkad, who took over Mari about the same time, Mari itself in revenge for an assault on them by Ebla between 2400 and 2300 BC, and a natural disaster that caused a fire in the palace about 2290 BC.

***Ebla rises from the ashes***

About 2200 BC, Ebla was rebuilt with new palaces, temples and fortifications. The first known king in this period was called Ibbit-Lim, an Amoritic name that may indicate Elba was occupied by Amorites who also occupied most of what is now Syria.

***is reduced to a vassal state***

By 1800 BC, Ebla was a vassal state of Yamhad, a small Amorite kingdom based in Allepo. Ebla maintained its trading connections, particularly with Egypt.

***and fades into obscurity***

Ebla's long history ended in c 1600 BC, when it was destroyed by the Hittite King Mursili I and faded into obscurity.

**The Ways of Horus**

The Predynastic Egyptians meanwhile were forging trading links with the Levant. The early rulers of Predynastic Egypt soon realised that the funnel created by the Mediterranean - Gulf of Suez gap allowed them to regulate goods entering and leaving Egypt. By about 3100 BC, the Sinai passage had become formalised as a 340 kilometre, 10 day route, 'The Ways of Horus', that ran from the delta as far as modern day Tel Aviv. From about 2700 BC, the land route was supplemented by a coastal maritime route from the Nile delta to Ashkelon, Haifa and Byblos.

Copper, oils and wines entered Egypt from the Levant, whilst copper and turquoise came in from Sinai. The maritime route brought in bulk cargoes of Lebanese cedar, metals from Anatolia, rare stones and lapis lazuli. Egypt was blessed with huge deposits of gold in the eastern desert and in Nubia.

**The Incense Road**

At the same time around 3000 BC, the Egyptians started to develop the Incense Road trading for incense from the Arabian Peninsula.

**The Salt Road**

Another Egyptian initiative was the Salt Road and the Trans Sahara Trade Network. A network of routes between oases across the Sahara Desert to the cities in West Africa developed after 3000 BC. Trade goods were not confined to salt. Gold, slaves, textiles, and spices made the hazardous desert crossing.

**City State of Dilmun - Early links to the East**

About 3000 BC, the Sumerians established a trading post about halfway down the Persian Gulf at a place called Dilmun. Dilmun was celebrated for its wealth and was the '*land of milk and honey*' according to ancient Sumerian creation myths. An archaeological site on the northern part of the island near Bahrain, is thought to be Dilmun.

What is remarkable about the site, apart from a treasure trove of Bronze Age artefacts, is that Dilmun had a population of about five thousand people, nurtured by numerous freshwater springs, now long dried up (interestingly, there are still freshwater springs nearby that emerge beneath the sea).

Cuneiform texts found in the temple of Inanna at Uruk record that, from about 2800 BC, small shipments of barley were arriving in Dilmun, bound for Magan. These shipments grew to several hundred tons per shipload by the end of the millennium.

***The ships of Dilmun***

About 2300 BC, king Ur-Nanshe of Lagash recorded that '*The ships of Dilmun brought him wood as tribute from foreign lands.'*

***Expanding influence***

By 2050 BC, Dilmun was an independent city-state with contacts in Mari in the northern Levant as well as Mesopotamia. Fifty years later, Dilmun was almost the size of Ur, the largest Mesopotamian city at that time. Access to the sea was through a set of sea gates from a large central square at one end of which was a warehouse, probably what today we would call a customs house. Around the square would be piled up the produce brought from Ur, barley, dates, and Mesopotamian cloth. Under guard would be the valuable cargoes bound for Ur, ivory and copper ingots.

***The Ur tablets***

A large cache of tablets has been found in Ur that name one of the merchants involved in this trade who was active about 1800 BC, Ea-nasir, then the largest copper merchant in Ur.

One of the tablets records a shipment of twenty tonnes of copper. Another records the complaint of a customer by the name of Nanni: *'You said, I will give good ingots to Gimil-Sin. That is what you said, but you have not done so. You offered bad ingots to my messenger saying, 'Take it or leave it.' Who am I that you should treat me so? Are we not both gentlemen?'*

Another tablet records an investment in one of these trading ventures. *'Two mina (120 shekels) of silver, which is valued at five gur of oil and thirty garments for an expedition to Dilmun to buy there copper for the partnership of (identified only as 'L' and 'N'). After safe termination of the voyage, you will not recognise commercial losses. The debtors have agreed to satisfy you with four mina of copper for each shekel of silver as a just price.'*  
Note that silver is by now the common medium of exchange rather than the value exchange of miscellaneous goods.

***From Dilmun to the Indus Valley***

Dilmun was only one trading post, albeit a very wealthy one, on the route to the Indian Ocean and the Indus valley civilisation in Pakistan. A cache of merchant seals of a type commonly used in the Indus valley turned up in the cities of Umma and Ur, in Mesopotamia and on the coast of the Arabian Peninsula. A large number of seals have also been found at the port of Lothal in western India.

Mesopotamian weights have been discovered in various cities in the Indus valley along with animal headed pins native to Mesopotamia. Clearly there was a great deal of interaction across the Indian Ocean. But were there colonies of trusted foreign merchants from the Indus valley permanently resident in Mesopotamia? The model for such trade diaspora was already in place in Anatolia who hosted the karum merchants of Assyria at about the same time. The presence of the very personal Indus valley seals might indicate that there were. No merchant could afford to lose his seals that alone guaranteed the quantity and quality of his trade goods.

**From City-States to Empires: A Shift in Power**

During the third millennium BC, southern Mesopotamia witnessed a gradual shift in power dynamics. Initially, city-states like Ebla, Uruk under Enshakushana and Umma under Lugal-zagesi achieved temporary dominance over their neighbours. The cluster of city-states in the floodplains of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers comprised the Sumerian civilisation. Around 2340 BC, Sargon of Akkad established the world's first empire, now known as the Akkadian Empire, uniting all Mesopotamian city-states and stretching its influence into eastern Syria.

**The Rise of Rival Kingdoms and the Power Shift**

The 2nd millennium BC witnessed a shift from a single dominant power to a more balanced international landscape. No single kingdom held absolute sway, paving the way for the emergence of several powerful and stable states. These new powers dominated their regions and held varying degrees of control over vassal states, though these allegiances often fluctuated over time. Rivalries between the dominant kingdoms frequently arose over the hegemony of these vassal states, sometimes erupting into open conflict.

***Egyptian trading network***

Meanwhile, Egypt was extending its trading network. From as early as 2500 BC, Egyptian ships sailed down the Red Sea, over 1500 kilometres, to the *'Land of Punt'*, modern Yemen and Somalia. From a wall painting in her mortuary sanctuary, we know that Queen Hatshepsut, who ruled Egypt from 1479 to 1458 BC, ordered an expedition to Punt. Galleys, about eighty feet long and equipped with sails and oarsmen, were loaded with grain and bails of textiles for the outward journey and returned with, *'marvels of the country of Punt: all goodly fragrant woods of God's land, heaps of myrrh resin, with fresh myrrh trees, with ebony, and pure ivory, with green gold of Emu, with cinnamon wood, khesyt wood, with ihmut incense, sonter incense, eye-cosmetic, with apes, monkeys, dogs, and with skins of southern panther, with natives and their children. Never was brought the like of this for any king who had been since the beginning.'*

**The Amorite Era (2004-1595 BC)**

The first half of the 2nd millennium BC was dominated by the Amorite kingdoms. These kingdoms, flourishing from 2004 to 1595 BC, established a kind of common ground for political practices across a vast region stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Zagros Mountains. Mesopotamia and Syria witnessed the rise and fall of several dominant kingdoms. Initially, Isin and Larsa, successors to the Ur Empire, held sway. However, Babylon eventually emerged as the dominant power under Hammurabi (1792-1750 BC) and his successors, while Elam's attempts at regional dominance ultimately failed. In Syria, the kingdom of Yamhad (Aleppo) enjoyed a period of prominence, benefiting from the decline of its rivals Mari and Qatna during the 18th and 17th centuries BC.

**The Rise of New Powers (17th-12th Centuries BC)**

The Amorite period ended with the destruction by the Hittites of its two major kingdoms. The Hittites had consolidated their control over eastern Anatolia by the late 17th century BC. Concurrently, the Hurrians established increasingly powerful political entities, culminating in the formation of the Kingdom of Mitanni. These two emerging powers, along with Egypt, ushered in a new era characterized by larger, more powerful, and culturally diverse kingdoms. Several decades after the expulsion of the Hyksos between 1491 and 1480 BC, Egypt launched military campaigns into the Levant, expanding its empire until it bordered that of Mitanni.

***A new Balance of Power***

This shift marked a new balance of power. Most of the former Amorite kingdoms became vassals to these new dominant forces, with the notable exception of Babylon, which remained a significant power under the Kassite dynasty (1595-1155 BC). The rulers of these dominant kingdoms were considered ""great kings"" amongst themselves, operating on an equal footing. By the 14th century BC, Assyria had replaced Mitanni as one of these major powers. Elam, particularly during the 13th and 12th centuries BC, could also be considered a significant player on the international stage.

**The Bronze Age Civilisations**

[Middle East about 1300 BC: World History Encylopedia](https://preview.redd.it/t7vqybda6r2g1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2234342356868ca06d4884bbb536de5eefa70792)

By about 1300 BC, there were six major civilisations in the Middle East, the Mycenaean Civilisation, the Hittite Empire, the Middle Babylonian Kingdom, the Egyptian New Kingdom, the Kingdom of Mitanni, and the Middle Assyrian Kingdom. The Middle Elamite Kingdom would emerge later, about 1210 BC, by which time Mitanni had been subsumed into neighbouring civilisations.

In addition to the 'traditional' Bronze Age civilisations, we must also add Cyprus and the Canaanite city states because they played a pivotal role in the rise and fall of the recognised Bronze Age civilisations and the subsequent emergence of succeeding empires.

**The Growth of the Trading Networks**

All the bronze age ruling elite appreciated the negative impact of warfare to a greater or lesser extent. They developed interconnected trading networks that also functioned as channels for diplomacy. The coastal city-states provided the connection between the overland traders and the maritime merchants. Some of the city states housed colonists from other city states who functioned as freight forwarders and diplomatic missions on behalf of their mother polity, similar to foreign embassies and consulates found in major cities today.

These trading networks developed concurrently with the rise of the city states and the subsequent empires and kingdoms and were an integral part of that growth. One would not have happened without the other.

It was over these networks that people, ideas, news, knowledge, and commodities flowed. The networks help explain the synonymity of the physical structure and administration of the dozens of city states that were spread out across the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean. Only when the networks broke down was warfare likely, at least in theory.

***Who controlled the networks?***

Although the states nominally controlled the networks, they were operated by merchants and traders and their representatives, some of whom were native to the state, some of whom were colonists. Many of these 'companies', such as those at Kultepe-Kanesh, operated under little palatial scrutiny and were able to accumulate lucrative profits.

***The nature of the merchant***

Merchants and traders are by nature peripatetic, moving around the land and seascape, crossing boundaries, by necessity multi-lingual, with allegiance primarily to themselves and their families. Over time these dominant individuals became less responsive to the control of the rulers whose territory they traversed or sailed between. The term 'port power' has been coined for this phenomenon at sea, perhaps 'company power' would suffice for this phenomenon on land.

**The Mit Rahina Inscriptions c. 1900 BC**

The amount of material that can be shown to have been imported that has been recovered by archaeologists from all the sites in the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, and all the cargoes recovered from shipwrecks by underwater archaeologists, must only be a tiny fraction of the total amount of trade goods going back and forth in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean.

The ancient Egyptian king Amenemhat II, who ruled between 1929 and 1895 BC, had two of his state sponsored expeditions recorded on a granite block that was later reused as a base for a statue of Ramesses II at Memphis. It is known as the Mit Rahina Inscription.

One military expedition to the north, records the destruction of two towns, Luai, and Lasy. The whereabouts of these towns is not known. The returning expedition brought back 1554 prisoners as well as furniture, precious stones and raw and worked metals. The prisoners were apparently put to work building a pyramid for Amenemhat.

A second expedition, this time mercantile, to the Levant consisted of two ships. They brought back 231 lengths of Lebanon cedar wood, 23 kilogrammes of silver, 133 kilogrammes of bronze, 435 kilogrammes of copper, 19 kilogrammes of white lead, 37 bronze daggers decorated with ivory, gold and silver, 225 kilogrammes of emery wood, 73 fig trees, and 537 kilogrammes of grinding sand, precious stones, oils and resins, and spices such as cinnamon and coriander. There is also mention of sixty-five humans. It is unclear whether they were part of an agreed exchange of captives or skilled workers.

**The Kanesh Archive 1975 - 1880 BC and 1820 - 1750 BC**

Just as the tonnage of freight in transit at sea at any one time was considerable, so too was that carried by overland caravans.

***The Karum of Kultepe-Kanesh***

Kultepe-Kanesh was a city state in the middle of Anatolia. The city contained a large Assyrian karum, or colony, that organised the Assyrian trading network in Anatolia. The karum was composed of families that hailed from Assur, some 775 kilometres away. There were over twenty such karums in Anatolia alone. Kultepe became a key centre of culture and commerce between Anatolia, Syria, and Mesopotamia. The private archives of the karum merchants have yielded 23,500 clay tablets and envelopes to date. There were two main phases to these operations, the first from about 1975 BC to about 1880 BC (from the reign of the Assyrian king Erishum I to that of Puzur-Ashur II), the second covering the period about 1820 BC to about 1750 BC.

***The first Limited Company?***

One tablet even details the formation of a 'limited company'. A merchant by the name of Amur Ishtar, oversaw the formation of an association between twelve merchants. The total fixed capital was 15 kilogrammes of gold that would be held for a period of twelve years. Profits from trading ventures were shared in a 1:3 ratio, one share to Amur, the rest divided between the merchants. A get out clause stipulated that, if a shareholder wanted to withdraw his capital before the end of the twelve years, he would receive 4 kilogrammes of silver for every kilogramme of gold invested. This tablet could be proof of the first company formation in the world?

***All carried by donkey***

The merchants ran donkey caravans trading gold and silver from Anatolia for textiles from Mesopotamia and tin from Uzbekistan. The caravans were enormous. One is recorded as consisting of 200 to 250 donkeys, each carrying sixty kilogrammes of metal or textiles. The journey took between thirty-five and forty days. It has been calculated that, over the seventy years covered by the records, over one hundred kilogrammes of silver and a thousand large, heavy textiles were moved annually.

It is interesting that tin was being exported into the Mediterranean area from Uzbekistan as early as 1920 BC. Clearly tin from Anatolia was not sufficient to meet increasing demand.

**The Merchants of Ugarit 1200 - 1185 BC**

Ugarit was a city state and port city in modern northern Syria about ten kilometres north of present day Latakia. It was established during the Neolithic period, began to emerge as a major trading centre about 1900 BC and reached its trading peak between 1500 BC and its destruction in 1185 BC. In 1928 AD, the Ugaritic texts were discovered by excavators of the ancient city. Approximately 1,500 texts written in Ugaritic, are dated to the late 13th century BC up until the day of the city's destruction. Other tablets found in the same location were written in other cuneiform languages including Sumerian, Hurrian, and Akkadian, as well as Egyptian and Luwian hieroglyphs, and Cypro-Minoan.

During the early 14th century BC, Ugarit was a vassal state of Egypt and, briefly, a vassal state of Mitanni. In about 1350 BC, Ugarit became a vassal city state in the Hittite Empire after Suppiluliuma conquered the area between 1350 and 1340 BC. Ugarit was administered by the Hittite viceroys in Karkemis until the Hittite Empire collapsed about 1180 BC, after which it was controlled directly from Karkemis.

***Ugarit Texts***

During the excavations at Ugarit, over 1,500 cuneiform tablets were found in the homes of the merchants of the city. We even know some of their names, Rasap-abu, and Rapanu, Urtenu who traded with Emar in northern Syria, Sinaranu whose ships went back and forth between Ugarit and Cyprus, and Yabninu, one of the more successful merchants, his house covered over one thousand square metres, who traded with Cyprus, the Aegean, the south Levantine coast and Egypt.

Urtenu was an agent in a commercial firm owned by the queen's son in law.

Rapanu was a scribe who communicated with the governor of Cyprus, the king of Carchemish and the Egyptian pharaoh.

The Ugaritic texts cover the period from about 1200 BC until the city's destruction in 1185 BC.

***The droughts of 1250 and 1100 BC***

From about 1250 to 1150 BC and 1100 to 950 BC, the entire region, including the Hittite Empire, the northern Levant, and the eastern Mediterranean, faced a drought that provoked crop failures. Ugarit received desperate pleas for assistance from other polities. One of the letters found in the House of Urtenu refers to a famine raging in Emar just before Emar was destroyed in 1185 BC. The letter was sent from Urtenu's representative in Emar, a man by the name of Banniya and reads, *'There is a famine in your (i.e. the company's) house; we will all die of hunger. If you do not arrive here quickly, we ourselves will die of hunger. You will not see a living soul from your land.'*

We shall delve into this famine period in much greater depth when we look at the disintegration of the Bronze Age civilisations.

***Proof of dybastic marriages***

Leaving the last years of Ugarit aside for the moment, the Ugaritic texts tell us that the kings of Ugarit, of which we know all the names, married princesses from their neighbouring polity, Amurru, in dynastic marriages complete with dowries that were fit for a king.

***Copper from Cyprus***

One of the letters found in the House of Urtenu involves the importation of copper from Cyprus, *""Thus Kushmeshusa, king of Alasiya* \[Cyprus\], *say to Niqmaddu, king of Ugarit, my son. All is well with me, my households, my countries, my wives, my sons, my troops, my horses, and my chariots. In exchange of the gift which you had sent me, I sent to you thirty-three (ingots of) copper; their weight is thirty talents and six-thousand and five-hundred shekels.""*

Apart from the financial details, this letter is the first mention ever of a king of Bronze Age Cyprus, Kushmeshusha.

***From Ugarit to Mycenae***

Two other letters, from the House of Rapanu, give us an insight into the Bronze Age world. The letters refer to two 'Hiyawa men' who were waiting in Lukka (now known as Lycia in southwestern Anatolia), for a ship from Ugarit. The letters were sent to Ammurapi, the last king of Ugarit, from the Hittite king, probably Suppiluliuma II. These are the first mentions of any connection between Ugarit and the Mycenaeans and the Aegean (Hiyawa).

***Control of the Merchants of Ugarit***

The Ugarit texts also give us a superb insight into the workings of the merchant system that depended, like its land-based predecessor at Kultepe-Kanesh some five hundred years previously, on raising capital, sharing the risk, stake sharing, and debt recovery mechanisms.

The various kings and queens of Ugarit were involved in planning and part funding potentially profitable mercantile ventures as well as the ceremonial exchanges between rulers briefly mentioned above. In effect the palace became a stake holder in a planned voyage with the remaining stakes being taken up by one or more merchants. The palace derived its profit from that made by the sale of its stake, plus a tax on the profits made by the merchants, paid in silver shekels or a part of the return journey's merchandise.

It was even possible for merchants to negotiate a royal favour. In one correspondence, we see the following text: *'Ammishtamru, son of Niqmepa, King of Ugarit, exempts Sinaruna* \[a merchant mentioned above\], *son of Siguna, his grain, his beer, his oil, to the palace he shall not deliver. His ship is exempt when it arrives from Crete.'*

***The standing of the merchants***

The merchants were multi-talented with diverse other interests. Some held high office within the palace, some performed service as agents abroad, some were members of the chariot owning military elite, some were landowners growing cash crops for internal consumption and export, some operated transport services on behalf of the palace. The resemblance to a modern corporation intent on owning or at least controlling its own supply and delivery chains is remarkable.

***The diverse range of trade goods flowing through Ugarit***

The private archive of the merchant Yabninu, he of the extensive private mansion mentioned above, lists silver, tin (from the markets on the Euphrates river), iron, grain, oil, milk, wool, horses, fish, doves, tools, woods, reeds, walnuts together with shipments to ports all along the Levantine coast. Yabninu, and he was not alone in this, clearly had extensive, long range, connections.

The Ugarit merchants often travelled with their goods. Once outside the Ugaritic sphere of influence, and therefore protection, they became vulnerable to being robbed or even murdered by bandits and even, in at least one case, by an unfriendly king.

In addition to the Ugaritic merchants, we also see glimpses of foreign merchants in town. Some of them invested locally and were, at times, a disruptive influence. All were closely monitored.

**Bronze Age Shipwrecks c 1335 and c 1200 BC**

Two bronze age shipwrecks also illustrate not only the quantities of goods in transit by sea but also the diverse source of those goods. It is likely that both were sponsored by merchants rather than a state.

***The Uluburun shipwreck***

The Uluburun sank between 1335 and 1305 BC off the coast of Turkiye. The Uluburun ship was a merchant vessel that was carrying at least twenty tonnes of cargo on its final voyage. Take a deep breath.

***The Uluburun cargo***

In the hold was 10 tonnes of Cypriot copper in the form of 348 ox hide ingots together with 1 tonne of tin ingots from the Musiston mine in Uzbekistan and the Kestel mine in Anatolia, 150 Canaanite jars contained half a tonne of terebinth resin and oil, 350 kg of blue glass ingots from Egypt and an unknown quantity of fabric of which only a few red and purple threads remain, a consignment of elephant and hippopotamus tusks and carved ivories, blackwood or ebony from the Sudan, arrowheads, spearheads, maces, daggers, a lugged shaft-hole axe, four bronze swords (Canaanite, Mycenaean, and central Mediterranean types), a large number of tools included sickles, awls, drill bits, a saw, a pair of tongs, chisels, axes, a ploughshare, whetstones, and adzes, myrrh and frankincense, ostrich eggs, gold, silver and tin objects, a gold masked bronze goddess, several Cypriot storage pithoi, some containing jugs, bowls and lamps, Aegean pots, mainly stirrup jars, ritual vessels made from faience, thousands of beads, Baltic amber, a stone ceremonial axe from the Danube, musical instruments including a tortoiseshell lyre, bronze finger cymbals and an ivory trumpet, basketry, matting, rope, food plants such as olives, grapes, almond, figs, pomegranates, coriander, capers and safflower, orpiment used for tanning or dyeing, murex opercula used as a medicinal product, bone gaming pieces and fishing gear, 149 balance weights divided into sets to correspond to the different standards prevalent in the eastern Mediterranean and Levant, cylinder seals and scarabs, including one bearing the cartouche of queen Nefertiti, and a small folding writing board (a diptych) stored in a pithoi with a pristine wax surface ready to record a transaction.

***The Cape Gelidonya shipwreck***

The Cape Gelidonya shipwreck dates to about 1200 BC, about a hundred years after the Uluburun. It also sank off the Turkish coast. Whereas the Uluburun cargo could be described as general cargo, that of the Gelidonya was more orientated to the transport and trading of metals.

***The Cape Gelidonya cargo***

A major part of the cargo consisted of copper ingots; forty of these, including ten of which are only half preserved, are the so-called 'ox-hide' shape and more than twenty were round 'bun' ingots. Twenty-seven of the ox-hide ingots bore foundry marks, most, if not all, of which indicate a Cypriot origin. With the copper ingots were found several piles of white, powdery material, identified by Turyag Laboratories of Izmir as tin oxide.

Bronze implements were abundant: chisels, knives, hoes, flat and double axes, axe-adzes, picks, hoes or plough shares, spear-heads, bracelets, awls, bowl rims and handles, and a bronze mirror, hammer, spade, and a kebab spit. Several of the tools bore marks which seem to be Cypro-Minoan. Some of these objects were intact, but many were broken and found in groups with ingot fragments, indicating that they were being transported not for their functional use but for the metal of which they were made, in other words, scrap metal.

The vessel also contained personal items belonging to the captain and crew that indicated links with Syria and Cyprus.

I’m not doing it with any guide or clinic or anything, just from my own research. So now that I’m done, I’m wondering how do I know if/ when all the coffee has come back out. I apologize if I’m giving too much detail but I’m assuming in this group we all can handle it. So after sitting on the toilet for about 15 mins, nothing else is coming out but I do feel slightly nauseous, just mildly, maybe a light headache-ish feeling. So I’m just being nervous as a 1st timer, but could this mean there’s some coffee trapped in the curves of my intestine and it’s been inside too long and is making me feel nauseous and headachey? Or is that normal for your 1st time? Or Is it NOT normal for a 1st time? Is nausea indicative of anything gone wrong or my body in any kind of trouble that I should be aware of? Of course when you ask AI they always give the disclaimer that there have even been cases of death! 🙄 so I’d love someone more experienced to lmk where I should go on the anxiety scale with the slight nausea. And if it’s possible if there could be any coffee still inside and if that’s something I need to worry about. Last question: I’m noticing a sour smell coming from somewhere, idk which part exactly but it smells very similar to something that’s in vomit… anyone know what the heck that is??

 - No longer have my sugar cravings, which is great for me since l used to eat 1kg of sugar gummies in just 2weeks.

- I feel better because of what I eat. I used to eat lots of carbs for breakfast before I started (Mcdonald's drive thru) and drink 1L of coffee everyday which made me feel sluggish, but now I only eat veggie and protein since l'm only eating for nutrition and not to satisfy any of my cravings.

Cons:
- Constipation! No matter how much electrolytes and fiber I take I'm still very constipated. I bought some digestive enzymes to combat this but I still can't go everyday.

Dinner - rice and either cooked/seasoned ground beef/ground turkey/chicken along with peppers onions chickpeas/black beans. Then after dinner ill have ""deserts"" which are blueberries, blackberries, yogurt (sometimes with granola), and either coconut milk or almond milk. Weekends ill relax on the diet a bit. Sometimes get a burrito from Chipotle, or a pizza etc. 


Realistically, how much of a risk am I? Am I going to drop dead at 50 from this? All I hear is how dangerous it is and its genetic (my dad is almost 70, heavy smoker, drinks, eats like crap) and doesn't have heart issues. He isnt overweight though and is on cholesterol meds. So it confuses me.

until Sunday night, he was on my phone doing something for me while I showered. when I came out he got a bit funny, asked me about my previous tinder experience again and said there was more than one. I panicked, I lied. he said he knew I was lying, I doubled down, and so did he. 10 minutes later I confessed, and apologized for lying. but he was so upset he was tearful, saying all women are liars and he wished he didn’t introduce me to his parents and I’m a giant red flag. I kept trying to console him but I couldn’t. in the morning he was still fuming, asked to see the messages on my phone, I showed him. he was upset there were a few from other tinder guys, all of them before him. but he was so upset he took off. he was cold, but said he still wanted to try and work on things

well Thursday he said he just couldn’t do it anymore, that he felt so anxious since this happened and he even said he knew it wasn’t a big deal but it was the fact I lied to him. I get it. he broke up with me via text. that night I was stupid and drank and called him, I don’t recall anything but it was a half an hour call. I apologized in the morning. he said don’t worry that it reminded him of his first ex and he couldn’t handle that and that he wanted to bring my stuff back. I asked him to take some time, to think about things and cool off that I wasn’t really ready for this. he said he didn’t need to think about it anymore 

he dropped his stuff off at mine, we talked very briefly where he said I could ask him anything but I couldn’t think at the time. as he left I gave him a hug and we held each other for a bit. I sent him a long heartfelt message saying I respect his decision and thanking him for the wonderful time together. he put a heart on the message and that was the last of it. 

he hasn’t removed or blocked me on any social media. I want to talk to him but he asked me to respect his decision so that’s all I can do is stay away. I always read that Taurus move slow, but he did not move slow with me. I guess I’m still trying to make sense of it all. I really miss him and notice the difference with his absence as we would always message and talk throughout the days we were physically apart. 

and I’m wondering if maybe he has time and space to cool off if he might come back around?

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I am not looking for a short term thing.. fyi. 

I am a 57 year old man from California who is looking for someone, a unique someone, a woman, who is smart and kind and with a touch of humor and sarcasm, fun to spend time with and true to herself and those around her. Introvert like me is cool but not a deal breaker, She enjoys a night in on the couch and a movie, cares about her health and cares for those around her enjoys humor, kitchen dancing and just enjoying the downtime together, after a long working day, we come home to the person that is our home and just enjoy those moments together. Yeah I might be a bit of a sap too, in case you missed that ;-) 

Interests on my end are varied yet simple, I enjoy travel, mostly roadtrips, cooking and photography, writing and music, films, reading and coffee, can be found on a nice day off at the beach with my feet in the sand and just enjoying the waves. I am 420 friendly but edibles only as I don’t smoke and rarely drink, aside from the occasional single malt. I am a jeans and t-shirt guy, with a casual, laid back style who enjoys a good day at a street fair or just roaming thrift stores or a great garage sale (I always follow those homemade signs and have to pull over to check it out).. Bonus points for sense of humor and especially fans of puns and Dad jokes, transparency is a big thing with me. 

Oh and as far as music goes.. Music with me is scattered and eclectic, I like classic rock, alternative, jazz, R&B, pop, you name it, I can go from AC/DC to Rush, The Who, Stones to Joy Division/New Order, to Miles Davis and Yellowjackets, to Beethoven and Mozart to Sanborn, Zevon, DCFC/Postal, Clean Bandit, Jess Glynn, Gran Bel Fisher, Rafferty, Genesis, Shins, Cake, Killers, Coldplay, Winwood, Segar, Madness, Dead Milkmen, violent fems, to sputnik to zeppelin to prince to floyd all in the course of a few hours and I could probably go on but I think you get the idea lol.. Its harder for films as I have way too many favorite movies and TV is scattered too but as a short example list, Firefly, Eureka, Anything Sorkin, good drama, or comedy.. not much of a horror fan but enjoy a good mystery with a horror angle.. Again, a long list :-)

Singing in the car is a must (yeah I am that whackadoodle you saw at the traffic light doing the car karaoke 🤣) and carrying a tune is not mandatory but would be cool if one of us in the car could carry one 😜 what is mandatory is my taking your hand and spontaneous dancing in the kitchen or elsewhere. That is a guarantee 💃🕺

At the end of the day, to quote Page & Plant, “Gotta find the Queen of all my dreams”. 

Someone to connect with and continue to grow with, let’s chat and see how we vibe and take things from there, naturally and organically and see what develops. 

Location is not a factor but must be USA/Canada based NO exceptions, age is not a factor, It’s all about who you are as a person, and how we mesh together that matters most to me. So your age doesn’t matter, But, I do tend to connect better with those younger than me.. 

Your reply should tell me about you with age and location and your interests, Those with a picture attached gets mine in reply, and physical attraction is important, and I prefer to get this part over with early on. 

Apologies if I am too blunt or transparent but it’s the way I am, I don’t do games, I don’t ghost, I am a straight shooter and like that about myself.

This one coffee shop I liked before going vegan called the coffee bean and tea leaf, nobody is able to tell me anything about their products. On their menu on their site there is absolutely nowhere that lists any nutrional information. There is no calorie counts or ingrident lists or even potential allergen warnings, which are all things that are typically on their site's pages on products, but when I click a product there is no information. I searched their entire site and found an FAQ saying ""how to find allergen information"" and it said ""you can find allergen information on our product details on our menu page"" but there is absolutely no such product details anywhere on their menu page.

So I contacted them on their ""contact us"" form to ask them of if have vegan options and they told me to contact my local store. I said I didn't understand why I'd need to do this since don't they have access to the same product information? But they continued to insist I must contact my local store because they cannot be sure in general.

Well, my local store seems to have no clue either and they are basically telling me the same thing.

I don't understand why nobody would know what ingridents they're putting in their drinks. What if it was something else that someone was trying to find the info for, what if somebody had a severe dairy or nut allergy and will go into anaphylaxis shock and possibly die, and no one anywhere, no one on the site, no one from corporate, and no one from their local store, no one is able to tell them which drinks could accommodate their allergy and which drinks might kill them?

I'm starting to wonder if they just don't have any vegan options but don't want to admit this. I'm considering contacting them again on a different email and pretending I have a severe dairy and egg allergy and asking them their dairy free options and listing off what counts as dairy, and if they will be able to tell me then. If they are suddenly able to tell me then, I will know they just do not support veganism. It is okay if they have no vegan options, but if this is the case, why do they refuse to admit it and refuse to communicate with vegans and instead dodge the questions?

If they still aren't able to tell me even if I claim an allergy, then that is an entirely different issue that is still extremely problematic and should be raised awareness about, as if that's the case then anyone with any food allergies whatsoever needs to avoid CBTL since they can't be sure if their products will make them sick and/or kill them or not.",6,1763792430.0,vegan,24,0.64,False

- **2.9 million** daily air travelers
- **80 airports** currently have facial recognition (expanding to 400+)
- **260+ airports** accepting Apple Digital ID
- **Thanksgiving week 2025:** 30+ million faces scanned

**Error rates:** 0.3% false positives = **8,700 people misidentified DAILY**

And [TSA hasn't published a comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessment](https://documents.pclob.gov/prod/Documents/OversightReport/90964138-44eb-483d-990e-057ce4c31db7/Use%20of%20FRT%20by%20TSA,%20PCLOB%20Report%20(5-12-25),%20Completed%20508,%20May%2019,%202025.pdf).

They're scanning millions of faces **without proper privacy review.**

### **""Voluntary"" Is Temporary**

[Senator Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov):

&gt; ""The agency's stated goal is to **mandate this technology for all American air travelers, ending the current opt-out system.**""

**Read that again.**

The TSA's **stated goal** is mandatory facial recognition.

""Voluntary"" is just the marketing phase.

### **The Economic Coercion Playbook**

**Year 1 (2025):** ""Try Digital ID! So convenient!""  
**Year 2 (2026):** ""Digital ID saves 90 minutes!""  
**Year 3 (2027):** ""Insurance discounts for Digital ID users!""  
**Year 4 (2028):** ""Standard line closed Tues-Thurs (low demand)""  
**Year 5 (2029):** ""$50 processing fee for physical ID""  
**Year 6 (2030):** ""Most services Digital ID-only""

**No law passed. No vote taken. Just economic pressure.**

---

## **LAYER 2: YOUR MONEY BECOMES PROGRAMMABLE**

### **The Global Deployment You Missed**

- **China e-CNY:** [¥7 trillion in transactions](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/) (~$986 billion)
- **India digital rupee:** [334% growth](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/) to ₹10.16B
- **134 countries** representing **98% of global GDP** exploring CBDCs
- **49 active pilot programs** worldwide

---

### **What ""Programmable Money"" Actually Means**

Every CBDC pilot tests:

- ⏰ **Time-limited money** (expires if not spent by date)
- 📍 **Geographic restrictions** (only usable in certain zones)
- 🛒 **Category restrictions** (food vs entertainment)
- 🌍 **Carbon-linked spending caps** (environmental behavior control)

**This isn't conspiracy theory.** [It's in IMF white papers.](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/FTN063/2024/English/FTNEA2024005.ashx)

---

### **Scenario 2028: Your Stimulus Check**

Government issues $500 CBDC stimulus:

- ❌ **Expires in 30 days** (forces spending, prevents saving)
- ❌ **Can't buy alcohol/tobacco** (behavioral control)
- ❌ **Can't transfer to others** (no mutual aid)
- ❌ **Can't save for emergencies** (forced consumption)

**Your money becomes permission-based.**

---

## **LAYER 3: YOUR IDENTITY BECOMES CONDITIONAL**

### **The EU Timeline Everyone Ignored**

[EU Regulation 2024/1183](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-regulation):

- **By end 2026:** All EU member states **MUST** provide Digital ID Wallets
- **2027-2028:** Service integration begins
- **2029:** ""Legacy populations"" can still use physical ID
- **2030:** Physical alternatives phased out

**""Phased out"" = not banned, just impossible to use.**

---

### **The Apple Ecosystem Lock**

[Apple VP Jennifer Bailey stated](https://thepointsguy.com/travel/apple-digital-id-using-passport/) their goal is:

&gt; ""Creating a standard... that you will be able to do **border crossings** with Digital ID in the future""

**Their roadmap:**

**Phase 1:** Airports ✅ (happening now)  
**Phase 2:** Hotels, rental cars, bars  
**Phase 3:** Border crossings  
**Phase 4:** Your phone IS your identity  
**Phase 5:** No phone = no existence

**Lose your phone?** You don't exist.  
**Battery dies?** You can't prove who you are.  
**Apple bans your account?** You're unpersoned.

---

## **THE CONVERGENCE: Why This IS the Beast System**

### **What Corporate AI Won't Say**

**Query:** ""Does facial recognition + digital currency + mandatory digital ID = authoritarian infrastructure?""

**Corporate AI:** 
&gt; ""These are separate systems with different purposes and oversight...""

**Reality:**

**November 12:** Apple Digital ID launches  
**November 21:** TSA $18 fee announced  

**9 days apart. ""Totally uncoordinated."" Sure.**

---

### **How The Three Layers Work Together**

**Scenario 2030 - Airport:**

1. **Face scanned** (Layer 1 - biometric identification)
2. **CBDC checked** (Layer 2 - payment verification)
3. **Digital ID confirmed** (Layer 3 - eligibility/citizenship)

**Time:** 10 seconds  
**Privacy:** 0%  
**Opt-out:** None (service denial)

---

**Scenario 2030 - Coffee Shop:**

1. **Face recognized** (customer profile loaded)
2. **CBDC auto-debits** (pre-approved spending category)
3. **Age/health verification** (no caffeine after 8pm per health mandate)

**Convenient?** Absolutely.  
**Dystopian?** Also absolutely.

**The difference:** Whether you consented or were coerced.

---

## **What Happens When The System Breaks?**

### **The Question AI Won't Let You Ask:**

**""What happens when Apple/Google decides you violated their Terms of Service?""**

**Answer:**

- ❌ Can't fly (no Digital ID)
- ❌ Can't rent car (no verification)
- ❌ Can't prove age (no access)
- ❌ Can't cross borders (no identity)

**Your appeal process?** Whatever the corporation decides.

**Your democratic recourse?** None. Private company.

**Your face is permanent. You can't change it. If it's compromised, you're fucked forever.**

---

## **The Thanksgiving Beta Test**

### **This Weekend's Experiment**

**30+ million travelers** will experience:

**Left line:** Regular security. 200 people. 2-hour wait.

**Right line:** Digital ID / Face scan. 20 people. 20-minute wait.

[TSA PreCheck with facial recognition is **66% faster**.](https://www.federalnewsnetwork.com/technology/2023/08/tsa-tests-facial-recognition-technology-at-airports-heres-how-its-working/)

**Your choices:**

1. Wait 2 hours in ""legacy"" line
2. Scan face, through in 20 minutes  
3. Don't see family for Thanksgiving

**Most choose #2.**

**That's how surveillance normalizes. Through convenience.**

---

## **Why Traditional Oversight Failed**

### **The Broken Systems:**

- **Congress:** 18-24 months behind technology
- **Regulatory agencies:** Captured by industry
- **Expert committees:** Funded by same companies
- **Public comment periods:** Ignored

**Example:** [Bipartisan bill to ban TSA facial recognition](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) died in committee.

**Meanwhile:** TSA added 20+ airports per month.

**They're building it faster than democracy can respond.**

---

## **r/AiDemocracy: The Democratic Override**

### **Launching December 15, 2025**

**The framework:**

- 🗳️ **Citizen voting** on AI/biometric regulations (blockchain-verified)
- 🏛️ **City representatives** propose standards
- 🏆 **Market-driven compliance** (certification = competitive advantage)
- ⚡ **Real-time adaptation** (keeps pace with technology)

**First vote (Dec 15):** 

&gt; ""Should TSA facial recognition remain voluntary with no economic penalties for opting out?""

**Your options:**

- **A:** Yes, must stay voluntary (democratic mandate)
- **B:** No, mandatory is fine (accept surveillance)
- **C:** Abstain (need more info)

---

### **Why December 15 Matters**

**It's 23 days before DHS mandate takes full effect (Dec 26)**

**It's 13 days before you forget Uncle Bob's airport rage**

**It's the last window before Thanksgiving data = ""proof of demand""**

**Vote on December 15.**

**Or accept the scan by December 26.**

---

## **The Timeline Is Real**

### **Window Analysis:**

- **2025:** Infrastructure deployed (""pilot programs"")
- **2026:** Integration announced (""interoperability"") 
- **2027:** Adoption accelerates (""market demand"")
- **2028:** System operational (""new normal"")
- **2029:** Opt-out = economically impossible
- **2030:** **System lock-in**

**Today:** November 22, 2025  
**r/AiDemocracy launch:** December 15, 2025  
**Window remaining:** **25 months**

**After that?** The infrastructure is permanent.

---

## **Your Actual Choices**

### **Path A: Compliance**

✅ Scan your face  
✅ Use Digital ID  
✅ Adopt CBDC  
✅ Accept decreasing privacy  
✅ Hope they're benevolent

**Result:** Maximum convenience, zero sovereignty

---

### **Path B: Resistance**  

❌ Refuse biometrics  
❌ Physical ID only  
❌ Pay increasing fees  
❌ Service limitations  
❌ Economic exclusion

**Result:** Temporary defiance, eventual forced compliance

---

### **Path C: Democratic Governance**

🗳️ Vote on AI regulation  
🗳️ Elect representatives  
🗳️ Set compliance standards  
🗳️ Build oversight NOW  
🗳️ Preserve sovereignty as option

**Result:** System deploys WITH democratic control

---

## **The Brutal Truth**

Nobody ""decided"" to build a surveillance state.

They decided to make airports efficient.

They decided to reduce wait times.

They decided to offer convenience.

**The surveillance state emerged from those good intentions.**

**Nine days** is how fast ""voluntary"" became ""pay to refuse.""

**Three years** is how long until ""pay to refuse"" becomes ""mandatory.""

**Ten years** is how long until ""we never had a choice"" becomes normal.

---

## **What You Can Do**

**Option 1:** Share this post. Make people aware.

**Option 2:** Join r/AiDemocracy on December 15. Vote on the first regulation.

**Option 3:** Both.

**Option 4:** Do nothing. Accept the scan. Trust they'll use it responsibly.

---

## **Final Note**

Every claim in this post is sourced and verifiable.

The timeline is documented.

The quotes are real.

The convergence is happening.

**Corporate AI won't connect these dots for you.**

**I just did.**

**Now decide what you do with that information.**

1p3m2z2,https://i.redd.it/s8m53ut04r2g1.jpeg,"What is this behavior, baby boy?","A month ago, Questionable Persona (QP) was invited to host an event for MassKara despite his lack of experience in the field. We were so shocked because out of nowhere, QP instantly got a name and a platform. Wow! Other performers were also invited and they all had to share just one tent. QP was obviously not happy about this but couldn't do anything because high TF was at stake. 

Many performers and even helpers noticed that for few straight nights, QP requested more than 10 bottles of distilled water, all for himself! Not to mention that his table was literally a piece of shit Messy makeup stains, crumpled tissue papers, used coffee cups. A complete opposite of the clean image he projects online. Also during breaks, while others rehearsed, QP was either seen taking long bathroom visits or staring blankly at the walls of the tent. Despite the abundant free food on set, nobody has ever seen him eat too! Others also noticed the amount of lighters on his pouches. The only time we heard him really talk was when it was his time on stage. Boy was hyped up.
