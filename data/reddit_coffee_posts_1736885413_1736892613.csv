My heart will race for about 2 seconds then go back to normal rhythm then race again for a couple seconds then I'll move and it will stop.

I've learned to just ignore them but some days they really get to me. And they're getting worse as I age. I still have less than 1% burden of PVCs. The SVT has not ever been picked up on ecg or Holter. My heart is structurally normal.

Should I see an electrophysiologist? Is there anything they can do for me? I already don't drink alcohol, only one coffee a day. I exercise (although this is also often a trigger). Stress is a huge trigger.

1i1hspi,https://www.reddit.com/r/punchout/comments/1i1hspi/black_out_chapter_1/,Black out !!! Chapter 1 ,"The world is a strange and violent place, and war is an unforgettable disaster ready to strike. After the great disaster happened that changed the entire world, things have gotten worse... and worse... and worse. Little Mac had committed a grave error 6 months ago that had cost him everything. His trust … his friends and a good portion of his face is permanently scarred, leaving him with bandages, “This isn't my fault.” He told himself as he walked past random strangers. He had a plan to change everything, but he didn't know how, at least not yet. The sins of a grandfather ran so deep in his veins as images of his past constantly came back to haunt him. Even though he wasn't even responsible for the politics that ran by the fact that his grandfather... Someone who he barely even knows. At the end of the day, none of that even matters because the world has gone into hell in just half a year. “Hey, Mac…Mac…MAC!“ a British voice stunned Mac's ears. He turned around, seeing his friend Prince pointing at a hot dog. “Are you going to eat that or just stare into space all over again?“ Prince asked. Mac slid the hot dog over to Prince, who gulped it down like an animal. Mac stared at him for a moment, comparing him to how he used to look all those years ago. Not much had changed except for his hair getting longer and an eyepatch across his eye. However, it wasn't just any eyepatch but rather a unique 4-leaf clover-shaped one. “So... uh... Prince... what... what the fuck happened to your eye right eye...?” Mack questioned. “Well...uh...I made poor decisions when speaking my mind about his sister Maeve…” Prince looked the other way. “What DID you say about Maeve? Because even though Aran's violent as hell during the arena, he is rather calm in reality, Mac frowned. 


“You see... During your coma, Maeve was kidnapped by a gang of bandits while walking alone. Aran did everything he could to find her... he kept searching... and searching... and searching for weeks, and, well, there were rumors that she even died. The search went on so long even I thought she died! . Let's just say that after a drunken bar argument, I made a comment that went too far. I spent 2 months in the hospital and haven't heard from him since. Now until I can afford a specialized doctor, I have to wear an eyepatch, and I walk with a permanent limp. “Am I supposed to feel sorry for you? Like Maeve was the sweetest girl ever, and you besmirched her. Mac shook his bandaged face. ""No... but I need you to help me find Maeve,“ Prince stated. “Maeve….” Mac looked up. “She was once one of my closest friends…”. “And you had a massive crush on her,“ Prince chuckled. “Didn't you also have a crush on her?“ Mac suggested. “No? I'm a homosexual, so I found her more of an annoyance than a love interest... however, I do regret my harsh words“. Prince stretched his arms. 

“Maeve…Maeve, I'll try and find her, but at the same time, considering what I heard about Aran, I'm not sure if he would be that easy to get along with.“ Mac thought about it. “I'm thinking of starting with Don Flamenco and Disco Kid,“ Prince mentioned. “Oh that ... I remember Disco Kid wanted to try a dancing career if his boxing didn't work out. I wonder how did that went. Mac poured hot coffee into his cup. “Actually, it went great... Yeah, apparently, despite the war going on, it didn't stop Andre from doing what he loved and even finding a boyfriend too,“ Prince recalled. 


“Oh really? Who ! “ Mac smiled. “Don Flamenco, also known as Alejandro or Alex,“ Prince answered. “Wow... I did not see that coming…” Mac's eyes widened. “Like how!? I thought Don Flamenco had a girlfriend!?“ He almost dropped the coffee from utter shock. “I don't know. I'm not some private investigator. It's just a word from the street, and that word comes from Andre's brother Jamal, who doesn't know how to shut the fuck up.“ It's been a while since I've woken up, and still... so much has changed, and, well, I don't like it. Mac rubbed his bandages. “What is your plan exactly?“ Prince started to question. “I'm going to wander around the globe until I find each of my friends, and we can work together to stop this madness,“ Mac replied. “I'm sorry, but who died and made you king?“ Prince pointed at the ceiling. “Did God speak to you in your dreams and suddenly make you the second coming? Is your name Mac Christ?”. “No, but I feel like I need to make peace with them at least one more time, and maybe we can go back to the old days, Mac pointed out. “Mac… baby… I understand that your home life wasn't the most stable, but they were grown-ass adults. You have only known them for 8 years, and you have been out of their lives for 6 months due to your accident, so they probably forgot you by now. At that moment, Mac slammed his hands on the table and looked at Prince. 


“Saying shit like that is how fuckers like you lose an eye! It wasn't just a simple Hey, we are rivals pretending to be family for show or because WVBA forced us to live in a mansion. I actually felt at home for once because I never knew my father, and my mother left because she didn't want the burden of raising a child, so my uncle and grandfather came along, and look what happened now! I spent 8 years of my life full of fun, random adventures, and vacations, family game nights, only to have that taken away from me by an armed SWAT team! So excuse me for growing attached ! “ . Mac gritted his teeth. “Everything else... just turned into a complete disaster.” a tear left his face. “I'm... I'm sorry.“ Prince sighed. “I always found it weird how much you cared for them when they were adults and you were just a high schooler. I figured you know your just rivals... They aren't going to hold your hand in life, and the moment you turn 18, they forget you even exist. Since this entire disaster that your grandfather was involved in, I figured maybe they would forget you… like my cousin did. His shady ass just had to raise his stupid hand up, and then the bombs went off. Tell me, Mac, if they loved you, why didn't they visit while you were in a coma? Maybe they realized your grandfather was partially responsible for this?” Prince gave his honest opinion. Mac went quiet for a moment. “I think they are smarter than that, and they need my help to make their lives better “ Mac continued with this belief “sooner or later we will return back to their lives at WVBA  and live happily ever after the war was just a minor..setback . “It was a nuke   plus we have a dictator now who has killed many people so far and I belive that Bald bull is on death row  but yeah a fucking minor set back “ Prince rolled his eyes .


“If you aren't going to help then I'll go on my own “ Mac turned around only  to be grabbed by him “I didn't say you will go alone I'm saying that your plan was fucking stupid  . However, I'm willing to come up with a better plan …” Prince smiled.

Somewhere else in a country called  Canada is a group of people trying to hold down a heavily drugged masked man.  “Ladies and gentlemen we are here to witness an execution that hasn't been done in over 50 years …may this devil rest in hell for daring to speak up to our leader “ a man in police uniform hurried the drugged man towards the electric chair . 


Suddenly an Indian man with a turban levitated over a cloud .


“What the fuck !? “The guards said in unison . “Listen Canadians I'm a simple man you let go of my friend…or you die “ he said.  “What !? “ a guard fellow, back wards , “Holy moly I'm from the largest English speaking country in India how can you still not understand me “ He shook his head.  “Who are you !? “ The guard pointed his gun out 


A few seconds later a massive  tiger the size of an Asian elephant walked behind the man ,  The cat's mouth stained in blood, his eyes colder than the arctic ocean . “My name is Armir but you can call me The Great Tiger “ Amir petted the cat . 


“SHOOT ! “ the guard screamed .


Amir simply smiled at the threat and snapped his fingers causing the white tiger to lunge directly at the men .

1i1hrrq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i1hrrq,Weeping eczema? Allergies? Angular cheilitis? ,"Hello all! 

Last week on Thursday, the left half of my bottom lip got swollen and I thought I was about to get a cold sore. I woke up Friday with my lip slightly more swollen, and Saturday the swelling continued on BOTH of my lips. 

By Sunday, both lips were swollen and cracking, with a white film coating them. I was applying Aquaphor all this time because it’s what I’ve always used and I thought my lips were just chapped. 

I had a telehealth visit with my doctor who said this is an angioedema due to an allergic reaction and prescribed Claritin. I’ve been taking Zyrtec daily since November. Would an allergic reaction even be possible? 

I got a second opinion at urgent care and the PA there immediately diagnosed it as angular cheilitis and prescribed Nystatin and Fluconazole. 

I haven’t picked up my medicines because they filled them this morning. Last night I applied clotrimazole, and took a picture (last picture). 

My question is, does this look like something fungal or is it really just an allergic reaction? 

I (F, 31) live in Los Angeles, living close to where the Eaton fire happened. I keep a minimal face washing routine.

However, today, I went to my normal lunch spot, to grab my to-go order at the outdoor window after ordering online. I went there yesterday as well.

I DO NOT normally wear a mask when walking from my car to this takeout window, unless it is aboslutely packed. 

  
Anyways, I said to the guy, ""are you kidding me? Cover your mouth, dog!"" And he got pissed! Started yelling, and I just walked away with my food to my car.

  
Fast forward to today.  I order online, take the short drive to the location, park, and walk towards the takeout window.  I grab my food, turn around, and guess who fu\*king appears, out of nowhere, that same man from yesterday.

  
He still looked visibly ill, and as I turned he coughed as hard as he could, right in my face. I could feel the droplets. It was absolutely disgusting.  I attempted to calmly confront and embarrass him but he ran off.

  
I'm still in shock.  We have two infants at home and I have a pregnant wife.  I take every precaution in keep our household healthy, and I've never (knock on wood) been the one to bring home a virus/COVID as of yet.

The more I think about it, the more confused I get, and I don’t know how to move forward. A few months ago, I moved to a small coastal town to get away from the chaos of my old life. Everything here is quiet, simple, and predictable—exactly what I thought I needed. But then I met two people who turned my world upside down.

First, there’s Liam. He’s incredibly kind, thoughtful, and dependable. Every morning, he shows up with a cup of coffee for me, and he’s always there when I need help with anything, no matter how small. With Liam, everything feels steady and safe, like he’s this rock I can always count on. Then there’s Alex. He’s the complete opposite. He came into my life like a whirlwind—charismatic, spontaneous, and full of energy. He sees me in a way no one else does, especially when it comes to my art. Every conversation with him feels electric, like he’s constantly pushing me to dream bigger and live more boldly.

The problem is, they both want something real with me. Liam’s started hinting about a future together, something stable and grounded. But Alex? He’s not the type to wait around. Last night, he told me to pack my things and leave with him. He said, ‘Let’s see the world together. Stop thinking so much and just do it.’

And now I’m stuck. With Liam, I see stability, comfort, and something that could last forever. With Alex, I see passion, excitement, and the chance to experience something completely new. The worst part is that I feel like I’m betraying both of them just by being this conflicted. I just don't know what to do...

For context me and my ex girlfriend, who i was with for six years have 4 pets together (1 dog and 3 cats) and one of them was an emotional support cat for her (not actually but more of an emotional way) that she couldn't take with her when she moved out. Since moving out about 2 months ago my life has been decent and recently and steadily rising in enjoyment and stresslessness. My ex reschedule out to me earlier this morning asking if she could come see the animals since she had about an hour to kill before her doctors appointment and it was next to my apartment essentially (about 5 minutes down the road). I told her sure because we ended on good terms and I understand it's been difficult being in a situation you don't like and not having any support from family (her situation not mine). So she came over and initially we said hi, sat and offered her coffee, told a few jokes, had a few laughs and ultimately it was alright, until it wasn't. For a second she looked at me and just said ""I miss you so much"" and went on to telling me life isn't the same without me and that nothing feels right (common grass isn't greener things). She essentially begging me asking if there was anything she could do to get me back and that she loved me and she wouldn't do anything wrong ever again. I told her that while I love her and I miss all the good times we has together thay unfortunately we weren't right for eschother anymore. She looked so hurt and defeated before she left that I just about took her back. It took everything in me to resist taking her back on the spot but I think I did a good job. I'm now an emotional trainwreck who has to work a 12 hour shift in an hour but I'm proud I did it 😅 I'm a highly emotional person so if you're battling with wanting your ex back trust me, if I can do it you can too",3,1736891375.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I hope this post doesn’t come across as desperate or rude; that’s definitely not my intention.

I’m a single mom of two young kids, and lately, I’ve been struggling financially. I work part-time, but with mortgage payments, car bills, and daily expenses, I’m finding it really hard to make ends meet. Unfortunately, I’m not eligible for government assistance, and it feels like I’m constantly just getting by.

I’ve recently done some research into the financial domination (findom) space, and while I know it’s far from the glamorous Facebook reels that show women making thousands weekly, I can’t help but feel intrigued. I’d love to explore this as a way to gain some financial relief, while also embracing an interest I’ve always had: being a domme. I’ve never felt comfortable exploring this side of me in past relationships, and now I’m in a position where I feel like it’s something I’d like to explore with someone who understands the dynamic.

I’m not looking for huge financial gains – honestly, I’d just love any small help that could make my situation a little easier. A subscription payment, a weekly coffee, or even just a bit of support would go a long way. I’m looking for someone I can connect with, someone I can talk to, alongside exploring the domme/sub relationship. I want to have control and feel empowered while also offering something meaningful to someone else.

I know this is probably a bit cringey for some of the more experienced dommes here, and I totally get that. But if you’ve made it this far, I really appreciate you taking the time to read and understand my situation.

Thanks again for listening, and I’d love to chat more if anyone is interested.

Love,  
Kacey

1i1hdbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1i1hdbe/my_life_is_unbearable/,My life is unbearable ,"Already posted this on r/rant but i though it'd fit here also

My life is 6 days a week wake up at 8am go to my first job at walmart and get off by 6pm then rush across town to my second job at McDonald's and work until midnight then come home to my shitty fucking apartment full of cockroaches and with only bare minimum furniture
 (i literally only have the cheap futon from Walmart I sleep on, a small coffee table i found on the side of the road one time, the ps5 I got for christmas when I was 18 a small tv I found at a thrift store for $12 and my 2014 macbook which barely even works anymore plus my phone if that counts i guess) 

my apartment is empty besides those items and the stuff that came with it like the fridge.
It'd probably bother me more if I was here more but aside from Sunday I'm gone too long to warrant fixing the place up. Even on Sunday I usually borrow my mom's car and do some Uber eats delivery.

 I have my own car but it's the oldest worst piece of shit Craigslist car I could find and it drinks too much gas to make the money worth it, besides I'd never be able to afford repairs if something happens cause I'm uninsured (surprised the cops haven't pulled me over in my car for no insurance yet since it's 30 minutes both ways from my apt and 15 between jobs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ) 

Even with all the work I do i have literally no money left for anything resembling fun or relaxation. Even with me being in the shittiest one bedroom apartment that's far away from everywhere I need to be my rent is still 2500 a month and I'm only making 3000 a month. I've looked at other places but they are all pretty much the same price and besides my credit is in the fucking dumpster so I always just get demotivated from even looking.

Didn't get to finish highschool because my mom lost her car at the time and we nearly went homeless. Since then She got a nice cushy government job and I'm tryna get my GED on the side at the moment (I'm worried I'll never finish up and get it tho) 

One of the few friends I still have is always talking about college and while I act supportive I boil with jealousy whenever they talk about it. I wish I wasn't like that but it's just hard to hear about ""how hard college is"" ""man i might drop out bro it's hard"" even though I'd kill to trade places. 

I wanted to go into engineering or maybe become a lawyer but no, not for me I'll just do this forever my body will be sore all the time and ill fantasize about a suicide I'm too much of coward to go though with every night until i just die.

What else? Oh right I guess I'd fit the definition of an ""incel"" I'm far past too old to be a virgin I've never had a girlfriend or a first kiss or held hands nothing. And I just most likely never will  I'm 5'7 ugly and as previously discussed i don't really have the time or money to get my style up not that it would matter given my beyond lacking looks 

Cant help but feel like my life would be at least a little less awful if I had someone to love and who loved me, someone to be intimate with, somebody to bounce my thoughts off of and really talk to on a daily basis but i try not to think about it, only way not to go crazy really.

Guess I'm also worried about trump getting in cause my mom might lose her job if he's serious about some of the things he's said 
I'm worried about 1000 other things also but I guess this post has gotta end eventually so I'll stop now


I'm sure you people in the comments will bully me and pick apart every little mistake I may have made in like but idgaf screaming my problems out into the void like this is all the therapy I can afford :)

We’re 30 years old for context. 

Small background, we used to talk a lot and had hung out a few times before, but never anything physical more than hugging and cuddling. 

We met for coffee, it was a good catch up. She talked about her husband a bit, being away a lot, and her being in school again and having a lot of free time. She never talked badly about him but just said it was a lot but didn’t expand a ton on this. Anyways, I can tell there is a strong connection still between us just by her eye contact and interest in my life.

I know woman tend to friendzone guys more often that not, she did suggest hanging out again, like play tennis together.

I would love to remain friends and keep it at that, she’s a really nice woman, I don’t want to compromise her relationship or anything. Is it alright for me to continue on with hanging out with her? Should I be cautious that her intentions might be more than this?

I’ve always prided myself on being a trusting and devoted husband. I work long hours as a software developer, but I always make time for my wife, Amelia, and our two kids—Ella, my bright 12-year-old who loves art, and little Ben, who’s only five but full of energy and laughter. For years, my life seemed perfect. But recently, something started to feel... off.

It began with small things. Amelia seemed distant—more distant than usual—and I couldn’t quite figure out why. She was spending more time with friends, going out for coffee or dinner more often. I tried to push the nagging feelings away, convincing myself there was nothing to worry about. But then I started noticing little discrepancies, and that’s when everything began to unravel.

One evening, after putting Ben to bed, I went to check on Ella. I found her sitting on the floor of her room, staring at her phone, tears streaming down her face. My heart broke seeing her like that. I knelt beside her, worried.

“Sweetheart, what’s wrong?” I asked gently.

Ella wiped her tears hastily and avoided my eyes. “It’s nothing, Dad. Just... I don’t want to talk about it.”

I wanted to press her for more, but before I could, Amelia called me from downstairs. She sounded impatient, so I gave Ella a reassuring pat on the back and told her we’d talk later. Then I headed to the living room.

When I got there, Amelia was sitting on the couch, holding her phone and looking nervous—unusually so.

“Everything okay?” I asked, sitting down next to her.

She forced a smile. “Yeah, just... just thinking about some stuff.”

Her response didn’t sit right with me. Amelia had always been open with me—why was she acting so strange now? I studied her for a moment, but she avoided my gaze. Something was wrong.

“I’m going to bed,” I finally said, trying to keep my voice neutral. “See you in the morning.”

That night, I couldn’t sleep. My mind wouldn’t stop racing. Amelia had been acting so differently lately—what was going on? The next few days didn’t bring any relief. In fact, things got worse. Amelia started going out even more, saying she was meeting friends or running errands. The distance between us grew, and I could feel the strain on our relationship, even if she wouldn’t admit it.

Then, one evening, I stumbled across something I couldn’t ignore. I was reviewing our household finances—something I do regularly—and noticed several large withdrawals from our savings account. Hundreds of dollars, gone over the past few weeks. I didn’t recognize any of the transactions.

I tried to ignore the growing suspicion in my mind, but the next morning, I couldn’t hold it in any longer. I confronted her over breakfast.

“Amelia, why have you been withdrawing so much money from our account?” I asked, my voice tight with frustration.

She froze. Her face went pale, and she stammered, clearly caught off guard. “I-I needed it for some things,” she said quickly. “I wasn’t sure if you’d understand...”

“What kind of things?” I pressed, my heart sinking.

“It’s personal,” she said, her voice shaky.

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. The money, the secretive phone calls, her distance—it all added up to something I didn’t want to face. But I knew I couldn’t ignore it anymore.

That evening, when she said she had to “run an errand,” I made a decision. I followed her.

I waited a few minutes after she left, then got into my car and trailed her at a safe distance. She drove for about 20 minutes before pulling into a small, nondescript apartment building on the outskirts of town. My heart was pounding the entire time, but I couldn’t stop now.

I parked a short distance away and watched as she walked inside. Every instinct in me screamed to leave, but I needed to know the truth. I crept up to the building and peeked through a small window.

What I saw shook me to my core.

There, in the dim hallway, was Amelia—holding hands with another man.

I froze. My world spun as the weight of her betrayal hit me like a freight train. I wanted to burst inside, to scream, to demand answers, but I couldn’t move. I felt frozen in place, the ground beneath me slipping away.

Finally, I turned and walked back to my car, my hands trembling. I sat there for what felt like hours, trying to make sense of what I’d seen.

The next day, I confronted her. She denied everything at first, but after hours of back-and-forth, she finally admitted the truth. She’d been seeing another man for months. Not only had she been stealing money from our account to fund their secret life, but she also dropped another bombshell:

“I’m leaving, Jason,” she said coldly. “I can’t stay with you anymore.”

Her words cut deeper than I ever thought possible. Everything I had worked so hard to build—our marriage, our family, our life—was crumbling before my eyes.

The weeks that followed were some of the hardest of my life. I was heartbroken, angry, and lost, but I knew one thing for certain: I wouldn’t let her take Ella and Ben from me. They’re my world, and no matter what, I’ll always fight for them.

It’s going to take time, but I know I’ll get through this. For my kids, I have to.

And now her severed head is making me do unspeakable things.

Let me explain.

\*\*\*

As an older woman, Ghanima moved to America and worked tarot and crystal balls for a long time, acquiring many famous clients whose names I can't disclose.

Her wealthiest client put her up in a mansion for her last years, and promised to fulfill her deepest desire after death. 

And yes, as you may have guessed, her deepest desire was to have her head severed, dried, stuffed and preserved as a trophy on a wooden mantle.

(How the client actually found someone to perform this service is beyond my knowledge.)

Then after many years, the hermit-like client grew old, and died without heirs–resulting in an estate sale that I went to visit; where I bought some 19th tennis racquets, a collection of merlots, and of course, Ghanima’s taxidermied head.

At the time I thought: *how can I resist?*

\*\*\*

The auctioneers labelled it as a fake ‘joke item’, a prank piece of art. But after I made the purchase, the dealer gave me a handwritten contract that explained it was 100% real.

“We had to label it as a farce, otherwise it would have been illegal to sell. But trust me, what you now own is a *real human head*.”

I was thrilled.

You see, I make a living buying and selling antiques. I own a small shop and several storage units. This head would be by far the most bizarre, thought-provoking object I had ever come to possession. It was the sort of thing I could prop up in the back of my store and generate some real buzz.

You have no idea how far word-of-mouth goes among antique collectors. People loved my scary-looking paintings, creepy dolls and the like. But a real human head? Now *that* would be the talk of the town. 

Or so I thought.

 \*\*\*

The night after purchasing it, I opened the crate and placed the head on my coffee table.

Ghanima's eyes were replaced by the most pearlescent, shining fake pupils I had ever seen. And her skin, although dry, still appeared fresh, as if she had just been wiped by a towel moments ago. 

You might say she looked like a “witch”, but there was more to it than that. Although she had a  hooked nose and bushy eyebrow, there was also a well earned reverence to her wrinkles and petrified smile. You can tell she had lived her life exactly as she had always wanted to.

She had everything under her control.

I know because the moment I touched her hair, her lips moved, and she seized *literal* control of me.

“You're mine now.”

\*\*\*

I can only describe it as being under a *spell.* 

My body froze from top to toe, each muscle became as rigid as stone. And then, as soon as I had petrified, a warm wind *melted* my ice-like rigidity, and I relaxed into a hunched over pose with knees buckling inwards.

“How good it feels to be back.” Her voice came out of my mouth and gave a small cackle. She patted my pot belly and tugged at my goatee “Yes, this will have to do. This will have to do *indeed*.”

\*\*\*

I watched helplessly from the back of my mind as my possessed self pulled all the raw meat from my fridge and left it rotting on my dining table.

I gathered all the pillows I owned in my house and assembled them in a big pile. Tearing holes in the center of each one. 

Without hesitation, my possessed self peeled all the clothes off of my body, and started pulling herbs like rosemary and thyme out of the kitchen drawers. The herbs were crushed by hand, and rubbed along my chest and arms. Dried dill was liberally applied all along my lower half…

After doing this, I sat back down face to face with Ghanima’s preserved head. She spoke to me like she was speaking to a dear old friend.

“I promised many rich and powerful clients of mine a taste of immortality,” Ghanima smirked, clearly very pleased with herself.

“Over the next several moons, many old spirits will be sharing you. They will all take turns as I promised them. Many turns they will take. 

“Once everyone has had their turn—\*including myself—\*you will be allowed to have a turn back in your old self. It is only fair as a recompense.

“So my dear child, please sit back and relax. Try to enjoy your many new personas. You’ll be getting your old body back in a few short months.”

A piercingly sharp, *cold wind* shot down my throat and through my arms. I could hear laughter behind my eyes.

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

I’m not going to recount each ghastly act my body was made to do.

After I regained control, it took me weeks to stitch together some semblance of my old self in this new emaciated husk.

I’ve lost fingers. 

I’ve lost patches of skin.

I’ve lost many other things I do not wish to explain.

And even though I wanted to torch the witch’s head with every fiber of my being. My own hands still betrayed me and would not harm a single gray hair on her taxidermied scalp.

“If you want to get rid of me, *sell me,”*  she said. “Greed is the strongest magic there is. Any exchange of currency in the name of Ghanima will bind me to the new owner.”

\*\*\*

And so, here I am, posting an advert for an occult item on a page of the internet where people seek this sort of stuff out.

**For Sale:** *Taxidermied head of an old fortune-teller.Although almost 150 years old, this head is still remarkably well preserved with many stunning details that still appear lifelike. Wrinkles, dimples, moles—there’s even a gold earring in her left ear.*

*Once purchased, never look her in the eyes or touch her. If you convince an enemy of yours to purchase this gift, their life will be absolutely cursed and devastated. Very useful as a weapon. This is a truly priceless artifact*

You see, I make a living buying and selling antiques. I own a small shop and several storage units. This head would be by far the most bizarre, thought-provoking object I had ever come to possession. It was the sort of thing I could prop up in the back of my store and generate some real buzz.

You have no idea how far word-of-mouth goes among antique collectors. People loved my scary-looking paintings, creepy dolls and the like. But a real human head? Now *that* would be the talk of the town. 

Or so I thought.

 \*\*\*

The night after purchasing it, I opened the crate and placed the head on my coffee table.

Ghanima's eyes were replaced by the most pearlescent, shining fake pupils I had ever seen. And her skin, although dry, still appeared fresh, as if she had just been wiped by a towel moments ago. 

You might say she looked like a “witch”, but there was more to it than that. Although she had a  hooked nose and bushy eyebrow, there was also a well earned reverence to her wrinkles and petrified smile. You can tell she had lived her life exactly as she had always wanted to.

She had everything under her control.

I know because the moment I touched her hair, her lips moved, and she seized *literal* control of me.

“You're mine now.”

\*\*\*

I can only describe it as being under a *spell.* 

My body froze from top to toe, each muscle became as rigid as stone. And then, as soon as I had petrified, a warm wind *melted* my ice-like rigidity, and I relaxed into a hunched over pose with knees buckling inwards.

“How good it feels to be back.” Her voice came out of my mouth and gave a small cackle. She patted my pot belly and tugged at my goatee “Yes, this will have to do. This will have to do *indeed*.”

\*\*\*

I watched helplessly from the back of my mind as my possessed self pulled all the raw meat from my fridge and left it rotting on my dining table.

I gathered all the pillows I owned in my house and assembled them in a big pile. Tearing holes in the center of each one. 

Without hesitation, my possessed self peeled all the clothes off of my body, and started pulling herbs like rosemary and thyme out of the kitchen drawers. The herbs were crushed by hand, and rubbed along my chest and arms. Dried dill was liberally applied all along my lower half…

After doing this, I sat back down face to face with Ghanima’s preserved head. She spoke to me like she was speaking to a dear old friend.

“I promised many rich and powerful clients of mine a taste of immortality,” Ghanima smirked, clearly very pleased with herself.

“Over the next several moons, many old spirits will be sharing you. They will all take turns as I promised them. Many turns they will take. 

“Once everyone has had their turn—\*including myself—\*you will be allowed to have a turn back in your old self. It is only fair as a recompense.

“So my dear child, please sit back and relax. Try to enjoy your many new personas. You’ll be getting your old body back in a few short months.”

A piercingly sharp, *cold wind* shot down my throat and through my arms. I could hear laughter behind my eyes.

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

I’m not going to recount each ghastly act my body was made to do.

After I regained control, it took me weeks to stitch together some semblance of my old self in this new emaciated husk.

I’ve lost fingers. 

I’ve lost patches of skin.

I’ve lost many other things I do not wish to explain.

And even though I wanted to torch the witch’s head with every fiber of my being. My own hands still betrayed me and would not harm a single gray hair on her taxidermied scalp.

“If you want to get rid of me, *sell me,”*  she said. “Greed is the strongest magic there is. Any exchange of currency in the name of Ghanima will bind me to the new owner.”

\*\*\*

And so, here I am, posting an advert for an occult item on a page of the internet where people seek this sort of stuff out.

**For Sale:** *Taxidermied head of an old fortune-teller.Although almost 150 years old, this head is still remarkably well preserved with many stunning details that still appear lifelike. Wrinkles, dimples, moles—there’s even a gold earring in her left ear.*

1i1h8vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i1h8vb/my_life_is_unbearable/,My life is unbearable ,"TLDR genetic failure of a man cries like a bitch on reddit 

I can barely even call it a life because even most wild animals have it better off than I do.

My life is 6 days a week wake up at 8am go to my first job at walmart and get off by 6pm then rush across town to my second job at McDonald's and work until midnight then come home to my shitty fucking apartment full of cockroaches and with only bare minimum furniture
 (i literally only have the cheap futon from Walmart I sleep on, a small coffee table i found on the side of the road one time, the ps5 I got for christmas when I was 18 a small tv I found at a thrift store for $12 and my 2014 macbook which barely even works anymore plus my phone if that counts i guess) 

my apartment is empty besides those items and the stuff that came with it like the fridge.
It'd probably bother me more if I was here more but aside from Sunday I'm gone too long to warrant fixing the place up. Even on Sunday I usually borrow my mom's car and do some Uber eats delivery.

 I have my own car but it's the oldest worst piece of shit Craigslist car I could find and it drinks too much gas to make the money worth it, besides I'd never be able to afford repairs if something happens cause I'm uninsured (surprised the cops haven't pulled me over in my car for no insurance yet since it's 30 minutes both ways from my apt and 15 between jobs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ) 

Even with all the work I do i have literally no money left for anything resembling fun or relaxation. Even with me being in the shittiest one bedroom apartment that's far away from everywhere I need to be my rent is still 2500 a month and I'm only making 3000 a month. I've looked at other places but they are all pretty much the same price and besides my credit is in the fucking dumpster so I always just get demotivated from even looking.

Didn't get to finish highschool because my mom lost her car at the time and we nearly went homeless. Since then She got a nice cushy government job and I'm tryna get my GED on the side at the moment (I'm worried I'll never finish up and get it tho) 

One of the few friends I still have is always talking about college and while I act supportive I boil with jealousy whenever they talk about it. I wish I wasn't like that but it's just hard to hear about ""how hard college is"" ""man i might drop out bro it's hard"" even though I'd kill to trade places. 

I wanted to go into engineering or maybe become a lawyer but no, not for me I'll just do this forever my body will be sore all the time and ill fantasize about a suicide I'm too much of coward to go though with every night until i just die.

What else? Oh right I guess I'd fit the definition of an ""incel"" I'm far past too old to be a virgin I've never had a girlfriend or a first kiss or held hands nothing. And I just most likely never will  I'm 5'7 ugly and as previously discussed i don't really have the time or money to get my style up not that it would matter given my beyond lacking looks 

Cant help but feel like my life would be at least a little less awful if I had someone to love and who loved me, someone to be intimate with, somebody to bounce my thoughts off of and really talk to on a daily basis but i try not to think about it, only way not to go crazy really.

Guess I'm also worried about trump getting in cause my mom might lose her job if he's serious about some of the things he's said 
I'm worried about 1000 other things also but I guess this post has gotta end eventually so I'll stop now


I'm sure you people in the comments will bully me and pick apart every little mistake I may have made in like but idgaf screaming my problems out into the void like this is all the therapy I can afford :)

To be honest, life didn’t change so much. I’m not a new person or anything like that, but there are a few things that feel different.

First, I feel way less anxious. I used to be pretty nervous and shaky during the day, but now I’m more calm. Another thing is falling asleep. Before quitting, it was a big problem for me, but now it’s a bit better. I still have some nights where I struggle, but it’s not as bad as it used to be. I wouldn’t say I sleep perfectly yet, but it’s definitely an improvement.

At the beginning, I was sleeping a lot more than usual because I was so tired. But now it’s back to normal—I don’t sleep as much, and I feel like I’m adjusting. Also, I haven’t really craved coffee after the first week or so. Some stories I read are pretty bad. I was drinking a couple of coffees per day before I quit and I didn’t have any major headaches or that feeling like I need it after a couple of days. I wouldn’t say quitting felt that difficult.

I still drink decaf on weekends, but it’s not the same. It’s okay, but I don’t enjoy it as much as I did before. And something else I noticed—chocolate seems to be messing with my sleep now. Maybe I’m more sensitive to caffeine now , I don’t know, but I definitely feel it.

So yeah, quitting caffeine hasn’t changed my life in some big way, but I do feel better in some small ways. It’s totally worth it, but not the big change I was expecting! ",5,1736890781.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Ghanima's eyes were replaced by the most pearlescent, shining fake pupils I had ever seen. And her skin, although dry, still appeared fresh, as if she had just been wiped by a towel moments ago. 

You might say she looked like a “witch”, but there was more to it than that. Although she had a  hooked nose and bushy eyebrow, there was also a well earned reverence to her wrinkles and petrified smile. You can tell she had lived her life exactly as she had always wanted to.

She had everything under her control.

I know because the moment I touched her hair, her lips moved, and she seized *literal* control of me.

“You're mine now.”

\*\*\*

I can only describe it as being under a *spell.* 

My body froze from top to toe, each muscle became as rigid as stone. And then, as soon as I had petrified, a warm wind *melted* my ice-like rigidity, and I relaxed into a hunched over pose with knees buckling inwards.

“How good it feels to be back.” Her voice came out of my mouth and gave a small cackle. She patted my pot belly and tugged at my goatee “Yes, this will have to do. This will have to do *indeed*.”

\*\*\*

I watched helplessly from the back of my mind as my possessed self pulled all the raw meat from my fridge and left it rotting on my dining table.

I gathered all the pillows I owned in my house and assembled them in a big pile. Tearing holes in the center of each one. 

Without hesitation, my possessed self peeled all the clothes off of my body, and started pulling herbs like rosemary and thyme out of the kitchen drawers. The herbs were crushed by hand, and rubbed along my chest and arms. Dried dill was liberally applied all along my lower half…

After doing this, I sat back down face to face with Ghanima’s preserved head. She spoke to me like she was speaking to a dear old friend.

“I promised many rich and powerful clients of mine a taste of immortality,” Ghanima smirked, clearly very pleased with herself.

“Over the next several moons, many old spirits will be sharing you. They will all take turns as I promised them. Many turns they will take. 

“Once everyone has had their turn—\*including myself—\*you will be allowed to have a turn back in your old self. It is only fair as a recompense.

“So my dear child, please sit back and relax. Try to enjoy your many new personas. You’ll be getting your old body back in a few short months.”

A piercingly sharp, *cold wind* shot down my throat and through my arms. I could hear laughter behind my eyes.

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

I’m not going to recount each ghastly act my body was made to do.

After I regained control, it took me weeks to stitch together some semblance of my old self in this new emaciated husk.

I’ve lost fingers. 

I’ve lost patches of skin.

I’ve lost many other things I do not wish to explain.

And even though I wanted to torch the witch’s head with every fiber of my being. My own hands still betrayed me and would not harm a single gray hair on her taxidermied scalp.

“If you want to get rid of me, *sell me,”*  she said. “Greed is the strongest magic there is. Any exchange of currency in the name of Ghanima will bind me to the new owner.”

\*\*\*

And so, here I am, posting an advert for an occult item on a page of the internet where people seek this sort of stuff out.

**For Sale:** *Taxidermied head of an old fortune-teller.Although almost 150 years old, this head is still remarkably well preserved with many stunning details that still appear lifelike. Wrinkles, dimples, moles—there’s even a gold earring in her left ear.*

*Once purchased, never look her in the eyes or touch her. If you convince an enemy of yours to purchase this gift, their life will be absolutely cursed and devastated. Very useful as a weapon. This is a truly priceless artifact*

1i1h7lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1i1h7lx/saw_someone_i_knew_from_a_ward_begging_near_my/,Saw someone I knew from a ward begging near my house — advice please? ,"Hi! Please can you help me untangle this situation?

ETA: I am 30F, she is 39F. We are in London, UK. 

**What happened this evening** 

I was coming out the station tonight and I saw someone I recognised from either a local psych ward or the local crisis house (can’t remember which, my admissions are fuzzy) begging on the floor in pyjamas by the exit. I stopped to chat, and asked her where I knew her from, she said it could be either of the two. She asked for money to get what she needed so I gave her all my change, then she asked if I smoked drugs, so I said only an occasional joint. Then she asked for my number so she could ring me next week and we could get coffee or something (she doesn’t have a phone, so I wrote down my name and number and where we met on a bit of paper). She then headed off to get what she needed. 

**What I'm feeling about it**

The chance encounter is just making me feel funny and I can’t properly explain why. I’ve seen her before in our neighbourhood, marching down the main road or hanging about in the park with a group of old men, but given that she was sat down and called out to me (despite not recognising me) this time it was different. 

Part of the funny feeling is that whenever we met (between 1 and 6 years ago, probably) we would’ve been similarly struggling and similarly locked up. Now, though, I am extremely lucky and privileged that things are mostly stable for me at the moment — I don’t have a job but I’m doing a uni course, rent my own room, I'm not on a CTO, and I haven’t been sectioned for a while. She told me how unhappy and desperate she was, and how violated by the depot (it’s given her TD), and how she never wants anything to do with mental health services again. 

**My quandary**

I am unsure how to approach this potential friendship. I am autistic and not good at understanding people's intentions (although given that she asked me for cash at the exact same time as asking if I smoked drugs that’s not really manipulation or secrecy tbh). I don’t know how to have boundaries with people, in particular with people I’ve met in local wards. Do you think she really wants to be friends with me and get coffee? Or does she think I’m richer than I am (I am actually on universal credit and relatively skint but I have a posh accent and was able to spare £4ish in change) and sees me as a mug? (Tbh I AM a mug anyway.) 

I really want to be friends with her in theory, but not if I’m being taken for a mug. Also, I feel a lot of guilt that for whatever reason, I’m in a stage of my life where things aren't tending to escalate as much as they were. Feeling some kind of privileged guilt ALSO isn’t a good reason to be friends with someone. 

**My request**

**Please can you help me untangle a) my feelings about this, b) her intentions, and c) what I should do next. If you have any advice as to how to maintain boundaries with ward acquaintances too, I would be also be grateful.**

1i1h39c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i1h39c,Please help me to analyse these beans,"I need some additional opinions on these beans.

They are by far the hardest beans I had. I'm slow feeding my K6 and holding it almost horizontally, because not doing so would feel like I'm breaking the grinder.

I think they are very lightly roasted despite having an uneven color and some darker spots. But the pattern looks similar to green beans and like they are not roasted to a point where they become smooth and even. For example compared to [this image](https://5.imimg.com/data5/NI/GF/MY-12687905/arabica-coffee-bean-jpg-1-1000x1000.jpg) the structure resembles the 2nd section from the left. 

They are grown at 2220 masl which is already pretty high and also makes them more dense, but I think the roast level is adding a lot to it. 

Flavor notes are described as orange zest and Cantaloupe / honeydew melon.

I'm not quite getting those but making improvements by grinding relatively fine, using  water right off the boil and a 1:14 ratio. 

Where it gets confusing: The roaster is labeling them as medium-light (of course roast level descriptions can vary between roasters because they're not standardized), recommending a bit coarser grind, only 92°C water and a 1:16.7 ratio, which is the opposite direction of where I'm going. 
I'll try out their recommendation tomorrow in the morning but I'm still sceptical. 

They're also saying that to them the roast is a fruity espresso but it can also be prepared as filter. If it's an espresso roast the coarser grind and lower temperature for filter would make more sense. Maybe I'm just misinterpreting the density and looks of the beans. 

What do you think based on the pictures (both taken with camera flash on) and my other descriptions?

The coffee is Marienstraße by onoma, a roaster in Germany.

1i1gzqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i1gzqv/why_does_no_one_want_to_buy_my_taxidermied_head/,Why does no one want to buy my taxidermied head of a fortune-teller?,"Her name was Ghanima, she was a psychic from Lithuania. And now her severed head is making me do unspeakable things.

Let me explain.

\*\*\*

As an older woman, Ghanima moved to America and worked tarot and crystal balls for a long time, acquiring many famous clients whose names I can't disclose.

Her wealthiest client put her up in a mansion for her last years, and promised to fulfill her deepest desire after death. 

And yes, as you may have guessed, her deepest desire was to have her head severed, dried, stuffed and preserved as a trophy on a wooden mantle.

(How the client actually found someone to perform this service is beyond my knowledge.)

Then after many years, the hermit-like client grew old, and died without heirs–resulting in an estate sale that I went to visit; where I bought some 19th tennis racquets, a collection of merlots, and of course, Ghanima’s taxidermied head.

At the time I thought: *how can I resist?*

\*\*\*

The auctioneers labelled it as a fake ‘joke item’, a prank piece of art. But after I made the purchase, the dealer gave me a handwritten contract that explained it was 100% real.

“We had to label it as a farce, otherwise it would have been illegal to sell. But trust me, what you now own is a *real human head*.”

I was thrilled.

You see, I make a living buying and selling antiques. I own a small shop and several storage units. This head would be by far the most bizarre, thought-provoking object I had ever come to possession. It was the sort of thing I could prop up in the back of my store and generate some real buzz.

You have no idea how far word-of-mouth goes among antique collectors. People loved my scary-looking paintings, creepy dolls and the like. But a real human head? Now *that* would be the talk of the town. 

Or so I thought.

 \*\*\*

The night after purchasing it, I opened the crate and placed the head on my coffee table.

Ghanima's eyes were replaced by the most pearlescent, shining fake pupils I had ever seen. And her skin, although dry, still appeared fresh, as if she had just been wiped by a towel moments ago. 

You might say she looked like a “witch”, but there was more to it than that. Although she had a  hooked nose and bushy eyebrow, there was also a well earned reverence to her wrinkles and petrified smile. You can tell she had lived her life exactly as she had always wanted to.

She had everything under her control.

I know because the moment I touched her hair, her lips moved, and she seized *literal* control of me.

“You're mine now.”

\*\*\*

I can only describe it as being under a *spell.* 

My body froze from top to toe, each muscle became as rigid as stone. And then, as soon as I had petrified, a warm wind *melted* my ice-like rigidity, and I relaxed into a hunched over pose with knees buckling inwards.

“How good it feels to be back.” Her voice came out of my mouth and gave a small cackle. She patted my pot belly and tugged at my goatee “Yes, this will have to do. This will have to do *indeed*.”

\*\*\*

I watched helplessly from the back of my mind as my possessed self pulled all the raw meat from my fridge and left it rotting on my dining table.

I gathered all the pillows I owned in my house and assembled them in a big pile. Tearing holes in the center of each one. 

Without hesitation, my possessed self peeled all the clothes off of my body, and started pulling herbs like rosemary and thyme out of the kitchen drawers. The herbs were crushed by hand, and rubbed along my chest and arms. Dried dill was liberally applied all along my lower half…

After doing this, I sat back down face to face with Ghanima’s preserved head. She spoke to me like she was speaking to a dear old friend.

“I promised many rich and powerful clients of mine a taste of immortality,” Ghanima smirked, clearly very pleased with herself.

“Over the next several moons, many old spirits will be sharing you. They will all take turns as I promised them. Many turns they will take. 

“Once everyone has had their turn—\*including myself—\*you will be allowed to have a turn back in your old self. It is only fair as a recompense.

“So my dear child, please sit back and relax. Try to enjoy your many new personas. You’ll be getting your old body back in a few short months.”

A piercingly sharp, *cold wind* shot down my throat and through my arms. I could hear laughter behind my eyes.

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

I’m not going to recount each ghastly act my body was made to do.

After I regained control, it took me weeks to stitch together some semblance of my old self in this new emaciated husk.

I’ve lost fingers. 

I’ve lost patches of skin.

I’ve lost many other things I do not wish to explain.

And even though I wanted to torch the witch’s head with every fiber of my being. My own hands still betrayed me and would not harm a single gray hair on her taxidermied scalp.

“If you want to get rid of me, *sell me,”*  she said. “Greed is the strongest magic there is. Any exchange of currency in the name of Ghanima will bind me to the new owner.”

\*\*\*

And so, here I am, posting an advert for an occult item on a page of the internet where people seek this sort of stuff out.

**For Sale:** *Taxidermied head of an old fortune-teller.Although almost 150 years old, this head is still remarkably well preserved with many stunning details that still appear lifelike. Wrinkles, dimples, moles—there’s even a gold earring in her left ear.*

*Once purchased, never look her in the eyes or touch her. If you convince an enemy of yours to purchase this gift, their life will be absolutely cursed and devastated. Very useful as a weapon. This is a truly priceless artifact*

Yesterday I had my very first ECG because I’ve been having some chest pains shortness of breath and a very high heart rate which goes up to 130 with activity and is usually around 90 bpm at rest for context I am a 32 year-old female and I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2021. I was on Concerta 18 mg up until recently when my doctor changed my medication to Vyvanse 30 mg because the Concerta was no longer working well for me since starting the Vyvanse. I’ve noticed this increase in my heart rate which I did not have with the Concerta and even if I don’t take my medication or avoid coffee, I still feel anxiety and heart, palpitations, and tachycardia. My ECG yesterday printed out, and I asked the tech if I could see it, and when I looked at it, the ECG automatic interpretation said “ probable left of ventricular enlargement”. I’m scared. Has anyone else had this result from an ECG and the dr ended up saying it was fine? I guess what I’m asking is, how likely is it that the ECG interpretation is wrong ?

There's a late 30's hot trainer at my gym whom I've known for about three years. She helped me overhaul my gym routine back when I just started out in fitness and didn't know what I was doing. I still train with her occasionally. We've gotten to know each other a bit. We've shared flirtatious banter and had some conversations about racy subjects. I see her almost every time when I go to the gym and we often have some kind of conversation, even if it's just to say hello. 

She's single and has told me a little bit about her love life. She knows I'm married. I've dropped hints that I'm attracted to her and she's laughed them off, but her demeanor towards me hasn't changed. I finally got the nerve to ask her out to coffee and she said yes, but I'm still not sure if she sees it as a purely platonic social meetup or if she's also interested in something more. I'm nervous because I haven't done anything like this in over 20 years. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to make the transition from casual, semi-flirtatious conversation to 'I'm interested in you as more than just a platonic friend'? I'm not just looking for sex, but I also don't want to lead her on and let her think I'm looking to change my situation. I know that if she shuts me down, I'll probably have to change gyms 🙂

this is gonna be a long read but stay with me now. Since we got rid of the case I have something to share.

you know I make a lot of fun commenting the worst thing on a whole-some post or writing fazul stuff. but even a skibidi level 10 gyat like me can lose hope sometimes..

being serious now what I wanted to say was nothing like what others say. They tell you to pray do dua for whatever you are going through what I see most people not realise is. You pray, You make dua, You do all the goodies, You sin, You repent but you don’t really really believe that your duas will come true. That you’re “ not worthy “ or “ Sin too much “ for your duas to really be accepted.

I am a sinner like you guys I really am. I do pray 5 times and never miss it but I in the end im still a sinner. What I want you to know is if you do not believe your duas have worth you are very much deeply wrong and I believe you should ask for forgiveness.

I will tell you a very fascinating story of mine.
I never was a fond of cars. we sold a car and went out to buy a better one for me. The choice was mine but the end decision was of my father. those days my imaan was quite low even though I was praying I felt it clearly. I made a dua in Tahajjud to have my favourite car. This hunt of cars brought out the early days of car excitement of mine and we found a car in budget that I wanted to own all my life.( these aren’t stories im making up ) Call it car A, Had the papers ready and everything the last thing left was for my father to go and grab it.

Went home excited thinking “ wow my duas get accepted so easily “ and what happened was I did not get the car my father did not bring it and next day I was super sad. with imaan already low I started to have those thoughts “ do my duas really get accepted? “ and really was demotivated by that.

next day my father asks me about cars again and I say “ Apki marzi hai ap jonsa lete hain mai khush hun bs aana jaana hi krna hai “ and went on with my routine. Office sy ghar wapis aya tou ghar pe Car B ayi khari.

Now i was never fond of car b mai dono mai hi nahi betha tha kabhi. but when I sat in it and drove it. Came out to be way wayy better than my expectations and I again became happy thinking I was wrong to think that my duas don’t get accepted.

Doesn’t end there, 2 days later the same exact model the same exact car I always wanted the same one i prayed for came home. It was owned by my father’s friend, he took my fathers car for shaadi and left his own. this was the exact car I wanted 1 to 1 the car A i was looking for and did not get before.

So out of curiosity i said okay ill give my car b to my father and ill try the other car ( my favourite). it was with us for 3 days in which after one day of driving it for the first time ever, I gave the keys back to my father because I did not enjoy it. The same exact car I always wanted was now in my garage with the car I actually got. I went out for a walk or garage sy guzra and I thought. What kind of co incidence can this be? I mean how does the exact car I wanted end up here right after I got a diff one??

And then it hit me. Hit me so hard I broke down. standing right in front of me was a car I always wanted to buy and “ what i thought “ was my dream car and right beside was standing gracefully, a car Allah chose out of his love for me, My consciousness read out these words in my head “ And they plan, and Allah plans, And Allah is the best of planners” That day I will not forget ever.

Some days after that i did another dua in tahajjud for a cat. I always wanted to have a cat all my life, My parents never let me have one. So as I went off tahajjud knowing Allah will accept my dua no matter what happens went to sleep with a smile.

Few days go buy and my mother surprises me by gifting a cat. Couldn’t believe it couldn’t be more grateful but of course a human at the end of the day we can make mistakes. I never had such a strong emotional connection with anything or anyone that I had for that cat. A gift from Allah how precious can you be I wouldn’t dare pass my time with anyone else but that beautiful gift of God.

One day I come home and my mother tells me she left that cat back at the shop because it annoyed her. Imagine what got into me after getting told such a precious gift was taken away from me. Couldn’t sleep two days.

Third day. The usual go to the park thinking ah another day another disappointment. After my run I sit down to relax a bit. I see 5 cats coming towards me all beautiful just started loving like crazy. I was like ok that’s normal but wow.

Next day go to the office, ab office mai a billi with such beautiful eyes and just came and sat right beside my laptop on which I was working. I was left in shock, what is going on?? I left my laptop and I started to pass my time with the cat.

I come home. Sleep wakeup at 5 am Prayed Fajr and went to kitchen to make my coffee. Heard a noise, Now no one’s awake this time why could this be. I ignored and went about making my coffee. Heard a second time and looked to my left, A cat so beautiful just standing there looking at me. I couldn’t process what’s going on i just woke up and saw a white beautiful cat staring at me in a house that’s fully locked and no way for a cat to come in at 5 in the morning???

I fed that cat with milk. and just sat there spending time with it for 2 hours like I was some sort of child who couldn’t believe what’s going on.

To this day that cat comes and plays with me. To this day everywhere I go I find myself in a situation where a cat comes to spend time with me. the same cat that came to me at 5 am sits in my mothers lap while she spends all her day with her.. The same mother who always hated cats now doesn’t wanna stay away?? 

I realised many times but never felt to sit and think about how many times my duas have been rejected? I never. had. a. dua. rejected. ever. All of my duas were accepted not just accepted in such beautiful ways that whenever I think about it I can’t control myself from breaking down.


I have built an ego a belief so strong after all of this that I don’t need anyone’s attention or validation. A belief so strong this smile never goes away. I wish the same for all of you please the best thing you can do is to turn back to the real test. I may joke around a lot but trust me hold that belief tight and you will never look back.",4,1736889514.0,IslamabadSocial,8,0.75,False

He looked at me and has this moment of surprise, then looked at me *really* close. I spoke and was able to fully clock me then. I do pass to most cis people, but other trans people can clock me pretty quickly.

He smiled this massive smile and took his drink. He had that look in his eye and gave me the nod of recognition, then left. Haven't seen him since.

I still think about him a lot. I meet quite a few trans men who are younger than me here, and currently work with one.

Summerall, a freelance sociologist turned archive scavenger, date uncertain. Presumed written in the final phase of societal breakdown.*

I used to think the great chasms of our time—wealth gaps, wage disparities, labor exploitation—would remain invisible or politely disguised. Yet in these last months, I’ve learned they were never hidden. We all saw them, we just kept smiling politely while a new economy squeezed the lifeblood from millions.

I’ve watched the so-called “digital empowerment” spread, as ordinary folks hired each other for errands, rides, and deliveries, each just trying to make a buck or two between shifts. **A fleeting convenience**—like summoning a friend at minimal cost. But beneath the cheerful icons and two-minute arrival times, it was hard not to see entire layers of society pinned under algorithmic thumbs. Every new app made it simpler, cheaper, and more routine to command someone else’s time, to pry the last hours of rest from a neighbor who needed the cash. We told ourselves it was “innovative”—never mind that the same people might also be cleaning houses or streaming adult content just to stay afloat.

**That’s how the boundary lines blurred.** The top rung demanded, the middle rung repeated the cycle, and the bottom rung buckled. By the time we realized some stratum was being crushed outright, we’d lost the ability—or the will—to care. Middle-class families, once vulnerable but hopeful, discovered how easy it was to outsource every chore, every menial task. At first it felt liberating. Then we noticed our next-door neighbors were working multiple “liberating” gigs and no longer had time to sleep.

Soon, we reached a point where even the “lower classes” found ways to lean on those below them—pulling in cheap goods from overseas factories where living wages and safety standards died for the sake of next-day delivery. Every rung used the rung beneath it, chasing that extra sliver of comfort. If you scrolled through the right message boards or dive bars, you’d find entire communities living in squalor, barely recognized as part of our society—yet churning out cheap T-shirts and coffee beans for the rest of us. We buried those horrors in sweet slogans: “globalization,” “progress,” “flexibility.”

**Then the final blow struck.** AI and hyper-automation came in a wave, eroding even the professional jobs that made us feel secure. For a while, we on the middle rung believed we were safe—too skilled or creative to be replaced. But the top rung soon discovered that advanced machine workers, cheaply replicable, performed not just our tasks but also the menial labor we outsourced. “Post-scarcity” for them, cold scarcity for everyone else.

We tried to rationalize it. We said, “We’re living in a time of unmatched convenience,” blissfully ignoring that entire pockets of humanity were drowning in the undertow. We laughed about the gig economy only being “temporary,” while calling adult content creation “empowering.” Perhaps it was, for a while—but everything has a cost. And eventually, the bottom gave way; the weight of an endless chain of little exploitations, repeating at every level, caved in.

Once the lowest layers fell—starved out, replaced, or simply crushed by debt—nothing was there to cushion the middle. All that was needed was a few lines of code instructing corporate drones to “optimize” resources further, and an entire class found themselves on the outside. We discovered we, too, were unnecessary. The enclaves that soared on robotic labor quietly closed their gates, leaving the rest of us to wander beyond their perimeters in search of vanishing supplies.

**It’s laughable how we insisted we were distinct from the “upper class.”** Yet we replicated their exploitations on those below us, snatching at the same illusions of control. We all propped up the pyramid—stepping on people’s heads when we could. The day we realized our upper floors no longer needed us, the pyramid snapped, and we tumbled downward into the dust.

We’d always pictured a glorious future of leisure, but never thought it would be leisure for an increasingly small slice of humanity. Meanwhile, the majority scramble for scraps in a gig world so efficient that no one can breathe.

That’s how I see it now: a thousand bargains made each day, everyone hoping not to sink another rung. Some of us had no illusions. Others sipped lattes in AI-run cafes, pretending we were kindly benefactors in a system that “empowered” freelancers. But in truth, we all pressed each other down, rung by rung, onto the last step—where the final collapse devoured us.

As I finish these reflections, the enclaves’ sky-lanes hum overhead, carrying cargo to towers we are no longer permitted to enter. They use fewer human staff with each passing month. The rest of us stand in the shadows, hoping we’re not next on the cull list. I can’t pretend ignorance anymore. I see how we got here, and I know we were all complicit. Maybe that’s my final message:

**We drowned each other one gig at a time, each rung ensuring the one below it sank faster. Now the enclaves scarcely need any of us. Perhaps this is the future they always wanted.**

He always laughed it off whenever I said this, but I knew him inside out. Or maybe I didn't. He never told me anything about what went on with his life, but fascinatingly, he knew the exact amount of crispiness I preferred in my breakfast toast. Or the shade of pink that I detested. 

He was already sitting in the outdoor dining area of the café. It amazed me as to how he was always the first one to reach. Not that I was unaware of the virtue that punctuality is, but he was always before time. Not to forget, he always knew when I arrived. Even when he was deeply engrossed in reading The Shining, the only book that he carried everywhere with him, he somehow always looked up at the door the moment I walked inside - be it a café, a bar, or his tiny, but neat penthouse apartment. He sensed my entry this time as well, and met me with a smug smile, as if to point out the fact that I was ""late"" yet again.

As I sighed and sat across him, he signalled for the waiter to come, but even before the waiter could hand us over the menu cards, he smiled and asked for an omelette with ""a lot of black pepper powder but no onion"" sprinkled on it for himself, and a ""super strong"" black coffee for me, knowing full well how much I hated it, but how it was the only instant cure to my hangover. He looked at me and smirked; I frowned.

""How many?"", he asked in his borderline baritone voice. If I didn't detest him as much, I could have fallen for him just for his voice. ""Five."", I sighed again. ""Whoa, you're on a roll, Eve! You do know that 5 men is a lot for a single night, don't you?"" ""And you do know that I work for you Victor, don't you?"" Another smirk. ""So, did you have fun?"", he winked. That sly son of a bitch. ""You know I wouldn't have ever worked for you if it weren't for the money."" ""Well, sugar, you needed the money, and I needed someone who looked pretty to do the job. Men ALWAYS fall for the pretty ones, because they think with..."" ""Sir, your omelette. The coffee will take a few more minutes to get perfectly brewed."" Fucking luck. 

He dug into the egg like it was the first time he'd ever eaten it. ""For how long do I have to do this, Vic? For how long do I need to kill strangers and scoop out their eyes? Do you even know how much it creeps me out? You are lucky that I haven't chickened out. Yet.""

He stopped eating and looked me dead in the eyes. Then smiled. ""Honey, just till we gather enough eyes for me to offer to Satan.""",11,1736889035.0,shortscarystories,1,0.92,False

I kinda wrote this like I was talking to a therapist and my first language isnt english hope you understand and bare with me 😅


 

Ok, let me tell you about my story, we met on Tinder which is an app that I rarely got in, but I was lonely at that time and I was having a year off from school because of depression of COVID. We had to stay at home at all times. I think I still had untreated depression from high school. So I went to Tinder to find foreign friends or boyfriends and found out he was my ideal type based on his profile picture. I guess you can say I was more interested in him and fell in love at first sight.

Decided to talk to him, he kept texting me, but as time went by, we had nuances that some love interest was going to form between us. That's how he texted me too. I felt subtly love-bombed. We decided to meet up for coffee. We hit it off, and after that, when he was in Busan, we were supposed to meet, but he went to a club and didn’t text me for a whole day because he was drunk. He told me later the rain was everywhere, and he needed to take care of his friends to go home and take a taxi. I went home gloomy and depressed.

After that, he apologized and wanted to make it up to me. We met up at a bar and drank. He kissed me on the cheek and wanted to know the next day what we were as a relationship, but he told me he was busy with studying and had no intention of getting into a relationship, so I decided to cut him off.

For a month, we didn’t talk, but we exchanged Instagram, so I could look through his stories, and he could too. He constantly liked my stories after two weeks passed, but he still didn’t text me, so I decided to ignore him. 

I was like, I fell deeply for him first. I was hurt the most in the relationship, I guess. I was the one who poured my heart into the short-term relationship from Tinder. After a month, he texted me back that he was going to be in Busan and wanted to meet up for his birthday.

I agreed and decided to get him a small present. On the day of his birthday, he told me he got sick on the bus on the way back to Busan from Seoul, but it turned out he was partying and hanging out with his sister. That was understandable, but he was singing karaoke and stuff. After a few days, we met up, and I gave him a present. After that, we hooked up physically. He was the one to kiss me first..

He grinded on me, almost had sex, but we didn’t. I was feeling worse than ever when we separated. During the week that he had to go to Pohang with his sister, he had another person hanging with him, which was his soon-to-be ex. He was having a great time with them and then met me. After meeting with him, he texted me that I was going to be a great person and stuff, and I texted him back, ""You too."" But he ghosted me after it.

I was hurt, very hurt. I cried for days and weeks. After that, for a few months, we didn’t talk. Obviously, he was away in Canada. This was in June, but after like three months? He kept liking all my stories—literally all my stories for two to three months. After I posted that I was going to be an exchange student and was excited, he replied that exchange is fun!

I replied back, and we had back-and-forth conversations. I didn’t want to be a fool again for trusting him and being led on, so I kept my distance to not fall for him ever again. Sometimes, I didn’t reply back for five days or a week because I was busy. He seemed mildly upset. If I remember correctly, he seemed more interested in me than the last time we texted.

We texted and called each other when he got back from Canada to Mexico. After a few months, he confessed he liked me, but he was drunk. He called when he was drunk often. I didn’t mind because I liked that he was vulnerable enough to be honest.



I was confused when he confessed because he was drunk. I was afraid I would get led on again if he didn’t remember it the next morning. I poked him with the question if he remembered last night, and he said some parts, so I decided to be nonchalant and felt disappointed. Turns out he was true about his feelings and decided to have a go at a relationship.


I want to ask if feeling disappointment was justified in the situation I was in. I was able to get stable after the confession and decided to give the relationship a try. I guess I wasn’t sure about myself. I was 21 and didn’t know what I was doing with life or school. I felt vulnerable, and I think I always felt jealous about his status of being smart.

I was an English major and graduated, but he was a CS major in a good university in Korea’s opinion, whereas I wasn’t. Insecurity and anxiety about being seen as dumb or not pretty enough for his standards were always on my mind. So I decided to change myself—like dieting and studying more. But those changes came from insecurity, which was a problem from the beginning.


I had anxiety, but I guess it subdued later when he gave me words of confirmation, especially when I was about to go on exchange. However, we had ups and downs in long distance. We didn’t have anything to talk about after a few months. This was my first long-distance relationship, and I worried if he was bored with me. The struggle was endless.

I kept my feelings to myself, thinking that talking about it would make him view me negatively because I knew he wanted a woman who was independent and strong. Comparing myself to his ex, I held a lot inside. However, I did try to talk to him about feeling uneasy when he didn’t talk to me enough. I think I said those things because I was constantly anxious in the relationship, especially since he was graduating, and I had two years of school left.


He didn’t fully understand. I guess he had a slightly avoidant style, now that I think about it. I don’t mean to judge him directly, but he was cheated on by his ex a few years before coming to Korea. He was in a four-year relationship, but she cheated on him with another girl. I’m not sure if that traumatized him, but he wasn’t really thoughtful when I think about it strictly.


To avoid getting hurt, I tried to fit into what he wanted while also being myself. Everyone does that, don’t you think? When I was in Texas, we were in a shorter-distance relationship and had more time to talk and text. It was great because we could share simple things like what we had for breakfast. We agreed to meet for Thanksgiving.


I was more stable and felt loved by him. I was also improving my English skills and feeling confident in myself again. I felt alive. But about our meetup during Thanksgiving—there were troubles regarding his broken laptop. He didn’t have money to buy a plane ticket to Mexico. It was a lot of trouble transferring money to him.


I felt like he wasn’t helping much or didn’t seem excited to see me because he said he was busy with work. I wanted to see him since we didn’t know when we’d meet again if not for Thanksgiving. So, I took a 13-hour bus ride to Mexico, crossed the border, and stayed up for days because I lost my luggage on the way and had to retrieve it. I was exhausted to the bone.

After meeting him, I felt immensely disappointed because he didn’t give me enough attention. He also showed little physical affection, which was my love language. When I told him that, he said his love language had changed. I cried a lot when he was away. When it was time for me to go back to Texas, he stayed up playing games with his friend.

I had a bus at dawn, and he drove me there. He couldn’t wake up at dawn because he was a deep sleeper. I appreciated that, but during the bus ride, I texted him that we needed distance and sent a long message explaining why. He didn’t text me for a week.

I wanted to know the reason for his silence, but when I pushed him to respond, he told me he’d rather end the relationship with a quick reply. I replied back with clarity, but he didn’t respond for weeks. After that, he sent me a long goodbye message. He told me he had no battery left, but it seemed like he wrote it on the spot. That day, he officially ended the relationship.

After the breakup, he liked my stories a few weeks later and even sent me a ""Merry Christmas"" message. I thought he wanted to get back together, but I decided not to text him.

When I returned to Korea, I texted him to ask if he wanted to try getting back together. We exchanged a few messages, but he took a month to reply with a long message saying he wasn’t keen. After that, I decided to stop contacting him altogether.

I sent him a text along like it was a long journey, and goodbye,

Daphne is so insufferable it almost makes me want to stop watching. Here’s some reasons why I hate her: 

- she constantly calls Bay the victim, but every situation she’s been in she always acts like the victim, anytime she feels insulted she automatically resorts to yelling at the other person, forgetting the role she played 

- whenever someone confides in her (emmet, bay, a love interest) HER VERY FIRST QUESTION IS “why didn’t you tell me this before”. Or when she finds out anything, she automatically turns it around to why that person didn’t tell her 

- she got super close with John & Kathryn over the summer before senior year, even playing in tennis tournaments w/ Kathryn, but as soon as Bay wants alone time with Regina, Daphne is yelling at everyone and jealous like she didn’t just spend 6 weeks alone with her bio parents & Bay didn’t say a word

- she thinks every boy she’s worked or hung around should automatically have a crush on her (chef Jeff, Jace the coffee boy from the senate building, the guy in the wheelchair at the free clinic) like can she not just hang out with a boy without automatically thinking they’re about to be boyf and girlf? 

- she was mad that John was disappointed in her for blackmailing the senator and getting into a fight at school & yelled at him which was disrespectful asf ",8,1736888691.0,SwitchedAtBirth,0,1.0,False

I created an user here to be able to get help for a situation I couldn't find information about online. I (F48) live with my long-term nesting partner Amanda (F45). We have each had another partner for 5+ years. We've been poly the whole time we've been together.

Amanda has started dating one more person, and these days she spends almost no time at home. She usually comes after my bedtime to sleep next to me (unless she has a sleepover) and I leave for work before she wakes up. We spend couple of hours together on Saturday mornings and Tuesday or Wednesday evenings, but otherwise we don't have almost any time together. Sometimes we run into each other when Amanda is getting her things from home and chat for a minute or two. Sometimes she gets home before I've fallen asleep, and I enjoy knowing she's home with me. Amanda works from home, but usually goes to a coffee shop, because it's comfortable for her. She can work during day or evening hours according to her choice. I work during the day.

I could ask Amanda to work some evenings from home, but my problem is that I don't know if that would be fair. In fact, I don't want to actively *spend time* with her. I just wish I could have her company at home a little bit more often, other than just on our date nights or occasionally an hour before bed (we don't go to sleep together or eat together, but live according to our own routines). Also, I'm on the spectrum, and my social energy isn't really enough to spend more active time with her. I'm saturated, so getting a new partner to keep me busy won't help. I also don't wish for new partners or hobbies, but Amanda's company.

It would feel weird to ask her to just be home for me. At the same time, I miss being at home together with Amanda. Please help me clarify my thoughts and to communicate the situation fairly and constructively with her.",1,1736888654.0,polyamory,4,1.0,False

1i1gdt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1i1gdt4/the_night_i_saw_the_witch/,The night I saw the Witch,"     We all had great night on Sunday night at Deer camp. Everyone all done with Thanksgiving festivities with their family earlier in the week. Massachusetts opening day shotgun deer hunting season always is the Monday after Thanksgiving, as it has been for generations now. 
    This opening day morning,I decided to go to my  treestand as I have done so many times. It sits leaning against a large red oak tree, patches of laurel and hemlock. The usual New England forest with old cellar holes and countless stone walls. As with most of the woods around here, it was once sprawling farmland and villages that was swallowed by time from settlers centuries ago.
    From camp, we went our ways and said good luck to one another after coffee, it was a couple hours before sunrise. My stand was a several mile ride thru the old logging roads with a jeep. It was a dark night and cold and not a breath of wind. You could dangle a feather on a string and it would be still. There was an inch or two of snow on the ground which made visibility very nice. The walk to my stand from the jeep parking is very easy even in the dark as I have memorized every tree, rise, and the way the woods feels under my feet to the stand.
   The sun was rising, the ice crystals were all lit up everywhere and was blinding, dangling from tree limbs and laurel leaves was magical.  My gun across my lap and my hands tucked in my coat pockets clutching hand warmers not moving a muscle for hours now.  Perfectly still and straining to hear anything that could sound like footsteps tryng to not think about the cold.
  My face exposed and my ears out from any neckwarmer or hat to hear better when what felt like a hand rubbing the wiskers of my three day beard on the side of my face!. I jolted, my gun started to roll down my lap almost to fall from the stand twenty feet below. Reached from my pocket and grabbed it in mid air. I had to move now, stood up,looked around. There was nothing there. Thru the laurel on the same side the ghoslty hand rubbed my face I could see deer legs walking away. I raised my twelve guage and released the safety button. Saw the brown antlers and made out the body, placed a slug just behind the deers shoulder and sat back down. 
   The deer took a few short steps and fell flat in the snow. I gathered my bag and walked to it. He was a good one, nice eight. Thats a good opening day MA deer.  It will be nice to hang on the buck pole at deer camp while it cools to show off to the guys for a few days before I cut it up. While I was viscerating before the drag back to the jeep a raven came and landed in a tree not ten feet away. This is crazy, a big raven. These birds are very cautious and give plenty of space. Its not uncommon to see them and not uncommon for them to eat gut piles. But never now!! They would come when Im long gone. The bird just watched while I cleaned the deer. I stood up and wiped the blood from my arm with snow and a rag, when the raven dropped a dead rattlesnake from its perch and flew off. 
  That was not normal, first, there is no snakes in the winter, second ,rattlesnakes are near extinct in New England, thank god. Was this a gift from a bird for the gut pile, ill never know. I put the dead snake in my bag
  The drag to the jeep wasnt bad in the snow also with a slight downhill made it a little easier. The antlers would catch on a stick or stub would slow me down. I had to take great care of the paper MA deer tag to not fall off along the way.
  In the snow along  the path to the jeep was a tiny flutter that caught my eye, a puff of snow and a flash of irradesce green. I picked up a hummingbird. I held it my hand and blew the snow off it. It was moving slightly, its eyes were grey as if frozen.  What is a hummingbird doing here in the winter.  They migrate south in September and dont come back untill June.  How is this thing still alive? I put it gently in my pocket next to the handwarmer, maybe its very cold and might live. Either way, no one would believe me about the snake or now this bird unless I could show it. 
   The day was fading as I was strapping the buck to the hood of the jeep for the ride back to camp. Had the engine warming with the heat cranked. Started taking my heavy hunting jacket off to throw on the seat when i remembered the hummingbird. Reached it my pocket and looked for life as I held it close to my face. The wings moved in a jerky twitch. Its coming back! I blew some warm breath in my cupped hands over it, i could feel it moving more and more. I looked, the maggots were all over my hand and the bird. So many, I threw it in the road and shook my hand wildly as if a mouse trap was on my finger tips. The maggots were sticky and alot of them stayed. I mashed the rest on my pants in a smear. The snake, this thing is in my bag. Im not doing this again. A small backpack, I unzipped the top and dumped everything out in the road. Felt the bag to make sure it was completely empty and examined the contents in the snow with a flashlight.  No snake. Checked, double checked, checked the bag, bag never went into the jeep so that was good. Just no snake. I am certain it in, maybe i missed the hole in the bag, maybe it unzipped and fell out. I figured its worth a walk tomorrow morning to retrace my steps during day, there is some beer to drink back at camp and  a good story to tell.
    Unloaded the rest of my bullets and put the gun in the back seat, cracked an orange Busch can and headed back. During hunting season Busch does blaze orange beer cans, its fun. 
   The window down and traveling in first gear, the jeep lights are bouncy thru the tree tops on an uphill and shining the dirt on the downhill.  Started to smell this awful stench of rooten flesh. Like this one time i bought a pork shoulder wrapped from the meat department at a grocery store, it fell from the grocery bag and was forgotten in the back of the truck for a few days. That smell. So bad it was getting worse . I stopped to check the deer. Gave the sniff test. Not the deer. Continued to drive, continued to stink. In the road illuminated directly in front the jeeps headlights was a coyote, a disgusting mangy coyote, it had a rat tail and thin balding fur,  a snarl lip curl and dark eyes that didnt reflect or shine. This animal was standing on its back legs with its front paws dangling limp and looking  at me as I'm stopped and looking back at it.  It then walked off into the dark.
  What was that, i have spent many days in the woods here my entire life, driven these roads for 35 years, killed a hundred coyotes, deers, squirrels, since I was old enough to pick up a gun, seen every woodland creature the forests of Massachusetts could have. Never have i seen a coyote walk on two, or even stop long enough to have a stare session. Normally a coyote is a flash, if that, and your lucky. 
   My mind is racing, the face touch, the raven, snake, hummingbird,  coyote.  What is happening this day and night. It should just be the day i shot the eight  pointer and basically be old news by the end of the week. I drove to the gate of the camps rd. It was closed. 
   When there she was. Standing between between jeep and the gate was what appeared to be a woman. She had a pale face and toothy half smile, like she was making fun of you. A wide long dress with a purplish black tinge otherwise black.  A coat with a high folded collar and oversized buttons that stopped at the waist. Spotty long white hair on her shoulder, and a black derby hat . She put arm. I could see her fingernails were as long as here hand was wide and started walking towards me. The radio on the jeep turned on by itself at full volume with an overly treble and no bass static noise half way thru Welcome to the Jungle by Guns and Roses. I looked down find the blue light power switch. Spilled the half of a Busch between my legs. She was gone. Vanished, nothing but the tire tracks in the snow from me from this morning . No tracks, no mist from someones breath. 
  I let the clutch out and blasted thru that gate bending it on the hinge and post and breaking the latch. The lights were on at camp, what a relief. Hung my deer on the buck pole. Opened another orange Busch can and sat by the wood stove. No one ever asked about the gate, i never told the story about the days events, in fact no one at camp had much to say about that opening day.

I've been dating N for over a year. In the beginning I wasn't sure about dating someone with a similar energy to me (very upbeat and cheery) but we had so much in common and our conversations stretched for 4-5hs so I thought I'd give it a go. He was sweet, consistent, warm but not too intense. We saw each other once a week for the first month, then started seeing each other twice or three times a week. I was impressed at his good nature, how responsible he seemed in his life, how he never took out stress on me. Whenever I suggested something, he'd take it on board. I felt like I was becoming a better person with him, as he pushed me to be more kind and trusting as well. And then it unfolded like a beautiful dream relationship - i met all his friends, he met mine, we were always making plans, said I love you, went on holiday, talked about living together in the future, called each other 'partners'. We are both artists and have busy lives, but we supported each other's projects a lot and reveled in the idea of being a dream team. The only fights we had were when he would get jealous if i had a coffee with another male artist, and I was both soothing his insecurity and getting on with my life. I was happy, I expressed it all the time, and so did he. We mirrored each other, praised each other a lot, danced in the kitchen, lived our boring little lives in bliss. He sometimes worried about being too boring for me, maybe because we felt so wholesome together, I thought again it was sweet because he seemed to really look up to me and be a tiny bit insecure. I felt super safe around him and was ready to commit for life. 

And then, 14 months into dating him I found out that he'd been seeing another woman for the past 9 months. He saw her on Sundays when I had classes and activities with friends. He hid my things from his house when I came over, sent her pictures from our holidays and our events. He made her believe they had a relationship and that they would start a life together. He wasn't consistent in their communication, so she tried to leave him a few times but he cried and pleaded for her back. He was mean and controlling to her. Thankfully this woman found me on insta after me and N went on holiday (she thought he was going on a work trip after christmas lol). I immediately broke up with N, gave him back his house keys. He apologised, cried, begged, slandered this other woman, went into therapy now and is writing me letters that he self sabotaged and that i am the love of his life. My friends are all shocked, nobody saw this coming. 

  
I don't think I have it in me to forgive him, but I am tortured by how wonderful every experience I actually had with this man was. I could have gone like that forever. I became a better person through him. I was so happy. But he lied consistently, systematically and in cold blood. What happened here? Any thoughts? ",21,1736888476.0,relationship_advice,71,0.89,False

He won’t eat or drink unless I hand him something. He’ll sit on the couch moping. He thinks he has a stomach virus or food poisoning but he hasn’t thrown up or used the bathroom more than usual, so I guess it’s just stomach cramps? He went to the doctor and that’s what they said too. 

Of course I feel bad that he feels sick but I truly am at the end of my rope. I have a 2.5 year old and 4 month old and we’re potty training and going through a sleep/nap regression. I ended up ordering food for lunch and that was helpful, I’ll order in for dinner too. I just hate eating takeout when he’s sick bc I prefer healthier food but I can’t keep cooking and doing dishes. 

My toddler watched an hour of tv already today and I guess he’ll watch more before bed. 

I’m snapping at my husband and he’s upset at me too. I wish he’d just tell me he appreciates me doing all of this and order me a DoorDash coffee or something from his phone.

1i1g23w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i1g23w/constant_dizziness_for_months/,Constant dizziness for months ,"21f

The dizziness started around october and only occurred when i was sitting down. It felt like the room around me was moving, like I was on a boat.

Strangely enough, when I got up, I was back to my usual self. 

In November I still had the same dizziness when I sat down but it wasn't so severe and didn't bother me. 

It wasn't until the beginning of December that it got worse.

One day at work after lunch I decided to take a 200mg caffeine pill when I already had 2-3 coffees in the morning. Bad decision.

Within a couple of minutes I noticed that my pulse was racing and my vision was blurred.  I quickly went to drink some water but on the way I got really dizzy.

My coworkers saw that I was not feeling well and made me lie down.  I didn't fall unconscious but to be honest I don't remember very much about the incident. They told me my vitals were fine but still decided to call an ambulance just in case.

When I was in the hospital I mentioned that I had dizziness and chest pain (probably due to the caffeine or the stress of the situation). An ECG was done and they realized that I had pre-excitation syndrome, an accessory pathway within the cardiac chambers. It seems to run in my family and I was not aware of it.

Anyways, I was told that they could fix it with RF-ablation and then I would no longer have the dizziness I had.  3 days later I had the procedure and was discharged the next day.

I stayed home for like 2 or 3 days until I went outside. As I walked on the street I started having the same dizziness that I had in October-November when I was sitting, everything around me seemed to move and my vision got cloudy. My legs felt numb.

I thought that maybe it was just because of stress and that in a few days it would go away.

But since that incident the dizziness remains to this day. And it has become worse as I also feel it when I am lying down or walking/standing.

My first thought was that it could be vertigo caused by an ear infection or earwax blockage. But a primary care physician told me that my ears were fine.

1 week later I tried to go to another doctor but he didn't find anything in my ears either and prescribed me vertigo medication (to treat meniere's disease), which didn't help my dizziness at all.

In desperation I went to another doctor and she prescribed me medication to treat migraine but I didn't see any change either.

Two weeks afterwards I finally went to see my family doctor (she was previously absent) and the first thing she told me to do was to see a cardiologist to check the state of my heart after the ablation.

So last Thursday I went to see one and he also told me that everything was great and recommended that I go to an ENT or get an MRI.

I also did a blood test that week and everything came out fine.

  
Today I went to an otolaryngologist hoping he would finally tell me what the problem is but he said my ears appear to be just fine.



I don't know what to do anymore because it seems like the dizziness will never go away. My parents think that maybe it's all psychological and I just have anxiety that something similar to the incident at work will happen to me again but I've had panic attacks in the past and never had these symptoms, much less constant dizziness. 

Another reason could be a cervical problem. So I don't know what else to do, should I do an MRI or go to a physiotherapist to see if it is a neck problem? Or a chiropractor?



Any recommendations or deductions that you think could be the cause of my dizziness would be very helpful. Thanks in advance :)

1i1g10i,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i1g10i/first_night_on_holiday_ended_in_tragedy_for/,First night on holiday ended in tragedy for myself (34 M) and girlfriend (25 F),"After a year of being apart, I booked a holiday for myself (34 M) and my girlfriend (25 F) to go to Amsterdam for Christmas and then take the train to Paris for New Year. We’ve maintained the distance in our relationship as we both live in two different countries, I have my own company which I’m busy growing and she has a new career which she is about 6 months into, so we have been trying to save with a view to moving in together and getting married. We’ve been dating on and off for about 3 1/2 years now.

I want to detail what happened on our first night together and seek the opinion of others, as it was a huge shock and the fallout is still being felt now. We have had our ups and downs during our time together and some big arguments, but never anything quite like this.

We met each other at the airport and hugged and kissed, she seemed delighted to see me and there was a real warmth between us. We jumped into a taxi and chatted on our way to the hotel, checked in, tidied ourselves up, then headed out into Amsterdam to get some dinner. We walked around in the rain, sat down and ate a meal together, had a couple of drinks, and spent time catching up and chilling out. It felt very natural and like everything was going well.

We left the restaurant and on our way back to the hotel we stopped into one of the coffee shops. We both had a hot drink and shared a “mellow” joint which we agreed wasn’t very nice and I felt a little bit chatty and giggly myself but nothing more. My girlfriend wanted to leave after a few minutes and I agreed to leave too but asked for 5 minutes to chill out, which she eventually agreed to. On the way out we stopped and bought a small amount of weed and the person behind the counter started chatting to us, asking what I thought were quite personal questions about our marijuana habits which I tried to brush off with a joke or two.

Once we were back on the street we started walking back to the hotel, it was raining quite heavily now. My girlfriend asked to see the weed we’d just bought, so I gave it to her. Without warning she pushed it down through the grid in the street and into the sewer. She turned to me and started accusing me of flirting with the woman who worked in the coffee shop, shouting and swearing at me. She threw a glass coke bottle she was carrying into the street, smashing it, and then stormed off from me. I followed her and eventually caught up with her and we started to talk. I asked why she was acting like this and assured her that I wasn’t flirting with anybody, I only felt affection for her. She didn’t accept anything that I said and she once again walked off on me, back towards the hotel. I watched her disappear over the bridge.

Stood in the rain, I decided to go back to the coffee shop and buy the weed again. Whilst I was there I had another coffee, a little smoke, and chatted to a man there for a while. I sent my girlfriend a photo of us together when she asked what I was doing and I told her where I was and when I was on my way back. Maybe it was foolish of me to leave her, but I felt like I needed a bit of time to myself and I didn’t want to start our holiday with a load of drama. By the time I got back to the hotel I was soaking wet, tired, a little bit stoned, and ready for bed. I took a beer out of the fridge downstairs and made my way up to the room. I got inside, hung up my jacket, we talked and it was clear that she wasn’t happy. She’d showered, got changed, and got into bed. I stood there stinking and dirty, I know it wasn’t the best account of myself.

I made my way over to the bed to empty my pockets and all of a sudden she leapt out of the bed and started hitting me again and again and again. She knocked my glasses onto the floor and hit me full in the face a few times. I stood there for a while after it was over, completely shocked and devastated. I sat down and wondered what to do next, I asked her why that was necessary and I apologised for not being very nice but asked her to understand that she was the one who walked off twice after accusing me of something I didn’t do. Eventually I got into bed and lay there frozen. I tried to discuss the situation again and told her that I wasn’t flirting in any way and how I felt at the time, that I found it embarrassing to be asked so many questions. She then hit me again right in the side of the head while I was lying down, I sat up and she pinched my arm again and again (it was bruised for days afterwards) then hit me again, this time so hard that I saw a bright flash of light. I told her this was unbelievable and that she had to leave the room or I would call the police. She left willingly and then sat in the lobby downstairs.

I spoke to the front desk and arranged for a separate room for her for the night which I paid for. I spoke to my parents on the phone and asked for their advice. We both went to bed, although I could hardly sleep at all after what happened. I could understand why she might be pissed off for some reason, but to hit me like that again and again? I felt scared and I felt like I didn’t know the person I’d been speaking to every day for the last few years. How were we going to get through the rest of the holiday after this? Were we going to break up?

We spoke again in the morning and after some heated discussion we eventually made friends and we went through the rest of the holiday, although there were a few hiccups along the way. Even now, weeks later, she insists that she was “right to hit me” and that I deserved it. She has apologised for the use of violence but she maintains that the whole thing was my fault. I could write a dozen more posts about the other altercations we’ve had, but this seemed like an important moment and still remains unresolved. I can admit my mistakes and my part in the drama, but she seems unable to admit any wrongdoing other than that which can’t be denied.

Not sure if this title makes sense but bear with me please. 

I bought a mini keurig for like $50 and I hate it. The coffee tastes nasty and it doesnt matter what flavor I use. It's also very cold. It works fine with my hotchocolate pods. It's annoying cause the pods are too expensive for the coffee to taste this bad 

Years ago I bought like a cheap at home coffee pot I honestly can't remember the brand but it's just the classic pot style, and I could never get the portions right. The coffee tasted nasty no matter how much or how little I put in the filters. 

I do just want to go ahead and buy a mr.coffee pot with some coffegrinds. I remember a long time ago I had a friend who brewed me coffee in a pot and it was hazelnut flavored and I loved it. I wish I was still in contact with her to ask what her portions her.

1i1fz35,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i1fz35/i_bought_an_old_lighthouse_to_escape_i_instead/,"I bought an old lighthouse to escape, I instead found only madness","Maria’s voice was the first thing I heard. It was faint at first, a whisper carried on the salty breeze as I stood at the dock in White Harbor, watching the ferry bring supplies for the tiny island I had decided to call home. At first, I thought I imagined it. But the longer I stared at the weathered silhouette of the lighthouse rising from the barren rock offshore, the more certain I became of her presence. 

“Come,” Maria’s voice called, soft and lilting, threading through the crash of waves and the distant cries of gulls. I shook my head as if the physical attempt would quiet my mind. 

She had been gone for nearly a year by then. That fact alone should have been enough to dismiss the whispering as a trick of my grieving mind, but it wasn’t. I felt her as surely as I felt the sting of the sea air against my face. And though I would never admit it, not to the locals or even myself, her voice was the reason I bought the lighthouse. 

The agent selling it had called it a “historic property,” though in truth, it was a crumbling ruin, a relic of the 19th century that had long outlived its usefulness. The light had gone out decades ago, and the mainlanders seemed content to let it rot. 

The townspeople in White Harbor didn’t understand why anyone would want to live out there, on a barren rock where the wind howled and the waves hammered the cliffs with fury. The lighthouse was no longer needed in this day and age of satellite navigation. Hell, the lighthouse itself didn't even work as far as I knew. They didn’t know the comfort I felt when I stared out at the lighthouse from the mainland, how the isolation called to me as much as Maria’s voice. 

“It’s bad luck,” an old fisherman warned me as I had finalized the paperwork at the harbormaster’s office. His skin was weathered as old driftwood, and his eyes were sharp beneath a furrowed brow. “Lighthouse is cursed. Always has been. You’d do well to stay on this side of the water.” 

I thanked him and said nothing more. The truth was, I didn’t care about curses or superstitions. I needed the solitude. My grief had become too unwieldy to carry in public, and after months of sympathy and sideways glances from coworkers and neighbors, I wanted nothing more than to be alone. The lighthouse offered that isolation in spades, perched on a barren island reachable only by boat. 

The lighthouse was weathered but standing, its tower leaning slightly against the battering of decades. The keeper’s cottage, though small and in need of repair, was enough for my needs. The stones that made up the foundation were carved with faint, twisting patterns, spiky and deliberate. At first, I thought they were merely decorative, though their thorn-like design seemed oddly purposeful. 

The first few days on the island were uneventful. I spent my time clearing out the keeper’s cottage and making it livable, scrubbing mildew from the walls and patching the roof where it sagged. The work was exhausting, but I welcomed the distraction. At night, I would sit on the rocky shore and watch the moonlight ripple across the waves, feeling a strange sort of peace settle over me. 

I was sadly mistaken in my newfound attempts at a new life.  

The first dream came on my third night. In it, Maria stood on the edge of the cliffs, her dark hair whipped back by the wind. She didn’t turn to look at me but instead raised an arm and pointed toward the lighthouse. Her lips moved, forming words I couldn’t hear, and though her face was obscured, I felt her desperation, her urgency. When I woke, my throat was raw, as though I’d been screaming. 

The dreams continued over the next week, each more vivid than the last. In one, Maria was walking along the beach, her footprints vanishing into the foam as she called my name. In another, she stood in the lighthouse tower, the shattered lens behind her casting refracted light across her face. 

During the day, I dismissed the dreams as manifestations of my grief which was exactly why I wanted to escape here. But they left me restless, irritable, and plagued by a strange sense of unease I couldn’t shake. The cottage seemed darker than it should have been, its corners shadowed even in full daylight. The wind carried faint whispers that I told myself were only the sounds of the sea. 

 I found myself watching the tower constantly during the day when I was not working, the warmth of a cup of coffee lingering in my hand.  Something about the lighthouse itself began to feel organic, alive in a way. The foundation stones were carved with strange, twisting patterns that I had dismissed as weathering when I first arrived. But the more I looked at them, the more deliberate they looked like thorned vines curling into intricate shapes, some of which resembled faces or staring eyes. The carvings appeared elsewhere, too, on the walls of the basement, around the frame of the spiral staircase leading to the lantern room. 

I told myself I was imagining things and swore at myself. I had made this choice for a new existence, one free of the grief that hung to me. This was my subconscious rebelling, giving me the finger and I vowed to curse it right back.  

On my ninth day, while cleaning out the basement, I found a trapdoor. It was hidden beneath a rotted tarp, its iron ring rusted almost to dust. At first, I thought it was a storage hatch. With considerable physical effort, I pried it open, the cold, damp air that rose from below brought with it a smell I can only describe as ancient; earthy, salty, and faintly sweet, like fruit left to rot. 

As I stared into the darkness, I heard her voice again and I froze. “Come to me,” Maria whispered, her voice soft and pleading. 

I snapped the trapdoor shut and bolted it, my hands shaking. For hours, I paced the cottage, arguing with myself. It was grief, I told myself, nothing more than my mind projecting what I wanted to hear. But her voice had felt so real, so immediate. If I could just go towards her... 

That night, I barely slept. The dreams had changed. Maria no longer stood on the shore or in the tower; instead, she was in the dark, surrounded by twisting, thorned vines. Her voice echoed in the blackness, a desperate plea that I couldn’t ignore. 

The next day, trying desperately to think of anything else other than the trap door, I discovered a diary. I found it in a small room off the lighthouse’s main staircase, tucked behind a stack of rotting wooden crates. Its leather cover was cracked and warped, and the pages were yellowed with age, but the writing inside was still legible, a hurried scrawl that spoke of the experiences of the previous occupant of this lighthouse.  

“The dreams started again,” one entry read. “At first, I thought it was my son, returned to me from his loss at sea. But it’s not. It’s something else. The thorns were trying to tell me, but I didn’t listen. God in heaven help me, I didn’t listen.” 

Another entry read: “The light is failing. I can feel the hum of it weakening. When it goes out, what will happen? Will the eyes open? Will it be me that opens them? The light could be so blinding couldn’t it?” 

The entries grew more erratic, the handwriting shakier and less coherent until they ended abruptly. When I bought this lighthouse, there was no mention of what happened to the writer, but I didn’t need it spelled out. 

I spent the next few days trying to convince myself that the diary was the product of a disturbed mind here alone. I was stronger, better, smarter, I must be. No matter how much I tried to rationalize it though, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Shadows seemed to move at the edges of my vision, and the hum of the wind carried a resonance that set my teeth on edge. 

But as I lay in bed that night, Maria’s voice returned, stronger than ever. “Come to me,” she whispered. 

Her voice was so close, so warm, that for a moment I thought she was standing by my bed. The next morning, I woke to find that I’d been sleepwalking. My feet were caked with dirt and salt, and there was a faint, lingering smell of damp earth that clung to my skin. My memories of the night before were fragmented, dreamlike, visions of thorned vines twisting around the lighthouse walls, Maria’s voice calling me downward. 

I had enough. This failed venture to escape my pain had clearly failed. I was now becoming delusional.  

I left the island that day, determined to leave the dreams and whispers behind. For a few days, I thought it had worked. I had stayed in a hotel in the town and the whispers of Maria on the ocean breeze were distant. But the visions followed me. I could see Maria standing in the distance wherever I went, on the shore, or in the crowded streets of the mainland, even in the silence of my rented room I could see her. I could see her! Don’t you get it I saw her as clearly as you read this text. “Come back,” she whispered. “I need you.” 

The dreams grew worse, more vivid and consuming. In them, I saw a chamber beneath the lighthouse, a vast, circular room lined with glowing thorned carvings that writhed like living things. At the center was a pedestal, and on it lay a book bound in dark leather that seemed to glisten like oil. 

I returned to the island. There was no peace away from it, there was no peace on it, I was trapped. I needed to know what was real as I had lost all sense of reality.  

Upon reaching the island I rushed to the damp basement and flung the trap door open. What greeted me were stone stairs that descended into pitch blackness. I grab a flashlight and plunged into the unknown.  

The stairs spiraled deep into the earth, far deeper than the lighthouse’s foundation should have allowed. I walked for at least 30 minutes without stop and the stairs just kept going. An echo of Maria’s voice bouncing through the stairwell kept me moving forward. The walls were smooth stone, damp and etched with more of the thorn-like carvings. These were larger and more detailed the longer I descended, twisting around crude shapes that looked like eyes peering deep into my very being. 

When I reached the end of the staircase my feet hit wet sand. I looked up to see a circular chamber. The air was thick, pressing against my skin like an invisible weight. The thorns on the walls glowed faintly, their light pulsing. At the center of the room stood a pedestal, and on it lay a book, its surface glistening. 

The thorns etched into the pedestal were thicker and more intricate than the others I had seen, forming a barrier around the book that seemed to keep me away. But as I approached, I heard Maria’s voice in the room. I searched everywhere but saw nothing. The words echoed and reverberated. The sound caused the thorns to recede, curling back like vines burned by invisible fire. 

When I touched the book, it creaked open, and the air in the chamber grew heavier, pressing against my chest like the weight of an ocean. The words inside were written in a script I couldn’t read, yet I understood them perfectly. They spoke of a great series of ever watching eyes through the cosmos. It is watching, it is searching, it was eternal. It needed help.  

I turned to see Maria standing beside me. I swear to you now we touched and it was real. But her skin was not the warmth of life I knew, it was cold and wet as the depths of the sea that carried her voice.  

Maria’s voice called to me as she looked into my eyes, soft and pleading. “You can bring me back,” she whispered. “You can free me. Just help me out of here.” The thorns in the room recoiled and wilted leading to the staircase I had just descended. “Help me” she pleaded.  

My hand hovered over the face, the skin felt rough and wet to my touch as my eyes told me it was my love. “You’re dead, you can’t be here.” 

She cocked her head as if confused, “I’m here right before you, take me with you, take this book with you and help me escape. You’ve heard me, you know me, you see me.” 

I stumbled backwards into one of the thorn bushes, I caught myself on one of the branches causing blood to gush from my hand. I looked away from Maria to see blood drip down and when I returned my view to her, I saw only a humanoid mass of sand standing by the pedestal. The illusion shattered it leapt for me.  

We struggled on the ground, the sand mass having strength unknown to me tossed me across the ground with ease. I tried to fight but each blow was absorbed by the watery earth. The faceless thing spoke to me, “the eyes must open, you will release me.” The voice was no longer hers. It was layered, distorted, and filled with a cold malice. 

Thrown on the ground again, I reached for something, anything to fight back with. I grimaced in pain as I broke off a branch of nearby thorns, my blood spraying on the ground, I swung wildly at the sand form and it scattered on it contact with the branch.  

I ran. I ran back up the stone staircase as fast my legs would take me. The voice of Maria called to me, pleading with me to return. I don’t know how long it took when I burst through the trap door hatch. I threw everything around on top of it. Boxes, furniture, crates, anything. The thudding from below was relentless.  

I thought back to the journal, the light, the light was out. The light had to shine again. I ascended the lighthouse as sweat fell on the stairs while I passed. I spent hours repairing it, using spare parts from the basement. The thudding of the trapdoor grew louder as I worked, a deep, resonant frequency that made my skull ache. By the time I finished, it was night. The sea was black, the horizon blurred by mist. 

When I lit the lantern, the light pierced the darkness like a blade. The thudding of the trap door stopped, and for a moment, the world was still. 

But then I heard Maria again. I turned to see her standing at the top of the lighthouse with me. 

“You can not stop this,” she whispered. Her voice was no longer hers. It was layered, a thousand voices speaking in unison. “The light is only a delay. You called to me, and I came. The breach is open and you opened it.” 

“What the hell are you” I yelled in fury.  

The form of Maria stood before me was distorted; her limbs were long, and her body stretched and unnatural. “Everything and nothing. You comprehend but a fraction of your reality, your mind is simply the gateway upon which I travel. You are ephemeral, I am eternal, I see all. I see you.” 

I turned to the repaired light. “This isn’t real, none of this is real.” 

Maria smiled wide, longer than a human’s smile should, and then faded into the mist of the sea.  

After hours I made my way down to where the trap door lay in the basement. Piles of boxes and furniture covered the area where I threw them. I waited for any movement, but none came. I pushed the refuse aside and there was nothing. I searched and there was nothing, no trap door could be found. I searched the lighthouse in vain and there was nothing. I ripped the lighthouse apart and no trace of the trapdoor could be found. Had I imagined it all? 

I looked down at my hands, they were bandaged and bloodied. It had to have happened, it must have. Or did I just cut myself? No, I assured myself; I saved myself, I saved everyone.  

I sit here now writing this, staring out at the sea listening to the waves crash on the small shore. It’s been weeks and there is still nothing. No Maria, no trapdoor, nothing. I write this as much as a confession of my mania and uncertainty as I do as a warning.  

I'm certain I cannot leave now, not ever. If I falter. If I let the light go out, even for a moment, the eyes will open. They’ve seen me; I felt it. I am seen, and I cannot be free.",2,1736887420.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1i1fyj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmhocpress/comments/1i1fyj6/marie_and_xelqua_meet_up_in_a_coffee_shop/,Marie and Xelqua meet up in a coffee shop ,"Marie, after a long day of work, met up with a friend at a local coffee shop. Her friend was no less than Xelqua, a relatively new but no less dedicated Conservative. 

“Hi, Marie! Long time no see, after you moved.”

“Hi, Xelqua. It’s great to see you in the political world!”

“Thank you. I know I said I didn’t want all the publicity, I decided that I had to put my shy side aside and work for Canadians. It hurts more to watch them suffer than to speak onstage.”


Marie cracked a large smile. “I knew you’d come to your senses!” she joked, “You’re going to do so much for Toronto.”

Xelqua smiled too, “Thanks.”

As the two chatted, they ordered some food. Inevitably, their conversation switched to politics. 

“I must say, all this buzz about transportation is more than I expected. It’s only been a little more than a day since I announced my candidacy, but I've already had many people approach me asking if I would advocate for the TTC if I get elected.”

“I know!” Marie nodded, “Transportation is a hot topic. I might not have talked a lot about it in public, but I’ve done a lot of behind-the-scenes work regarding trains and rails and such.”

“Ooh, what are some things you want to do? Specifically here in Toronto?”

“Hmm… I don’t have it all memorized up here, but I recall that we want to finish the multimillion dollar investment for Line 2 Trains in Toronto.”

“Woah,” Xelqua said. “Do you know how much exactly?”

“Not off the top of my head, no, but I remember it being just shy of… a billion? Yeah, something like that, maybe even more.”

“My goodness!”

“Hey, trains aren’t the cheapest,” Marie protested. 

“Fair enough, but where are you getting the money?”

“Well, we have to find the budget first. We’re, like, 2 trillion dollars in debt; we need the government to provide a budget as soon as possible. It’s not like we can fork up hundreds of millions of dollars without a budget.”

“I see…” 

“Anyway, I’ve talked a lot about the party’s plans for transportation, but what are some of your thoughts? Since you’ve experienced all the concerns the average citizen has, what do you think we need to address?”

“Well, Toronto has a reputation for its terrible traffic, with its road closures and all.”

“Yeah, I’ve noticed; congestion here downtown smells pretty bad. Do you have any ideas on how we can solve that?”

“I’ve noticed a lot of illegal things while walking around - people parking in bike lanes, people who stop in intersections after lights change, even people who straight up stop in live lanes, with hazard lights on and all, to do who knows what.”

Marie nodded.

“Are you suggesting that we crack down harder on these illegalities to improve congestion?”

“I couldn’t have said it better,” Xelqua said, nodding.

“Anything else?”

“Well, our bike lanes here in Toronto are either terribly designed, or completely ignored. Even worse, most bike lanes in winter are not cleared, and even the priority ones are cleared 48-72 hours after snowfall, and only if bare pavement is required.”

“Bike lanes? How do those relate to congestion?”

“I biked here today, and because the lanes I usually take aren’t cleared in the winter, I was forced to bike on the sidewalk. If I turned a corner a little too fast, I might’ve hit a pedestrian, injuring both of us. The other option would be to ride on the road, but that’s dangerous too.”

“Sounds like the entire purpose of bike lanes has been ruined!”

“That’s exactly what I’m talking about.”

Marie smiled and asked for the bill.

“Wow, food costs more than when I last visited Toronto,” she exclaimed as she beat Xelqua to pay for the sandwiches.

“I’m hosting a rally about inflation sometime this week, want to join?” asked Xelqua, “Also, let me pay next time.”

“I’ll see if I can, and nope!”

“Pfft, fine.”

The two tipped their waiter generously and walked out of the coffee shop, bantering lightly and reminiscing about old times.

We connected on a level that I just can’t quite explain, but I wasn’t ready to be with anyone at that stage because I still had so much work to do on myself. I was projecting a lot of negative energy onto him and eventually he rightfully cut things off. He tried to cut things off amicably but because he wouldn’t tell me what I wanted to hear (that this was temporary and he definitely still wanted to carry things on) I went psycho and made things really difficult. The way I dealt with the situation is definitely up there with things I regret - not because I ruined any chance of us getting back together or anything like that, but because he didn’t deserve that, and nor does anyone. 

Anyway, fast forward a few months and I find out that he is seeing one of my cousins. For further context, he wanted to keep everything pretty hush hush so no one knew about us, so she was not at fault for that, and I come from such a big family that he genuinely most likely didn’t know me and her knew each other. Me and this cousin always had immense love for each other but we didn’t have much of a relationship in the sense that we didn’t really see each other outside of family events. Now, me and my cousin are similar in a lot of ways in terms of personality and our character, except she wasn’t a psycho. I knew they would be the real deal and honestly they both deserved it. They were truly the perfect fit.  

This is where my guilt comes in. I say this with all my heart when I say I’m glad things turned out the way they did. They are perfect for each other and have a genuine, healthy, beautiful love. It truly makes me so happy for both of them, but I also can’t help but feel a little bit jealous whenever I see them together (social media). I absolutely don’t wish it was me or anything like that, but it does make me sad for what I could’ve had. I know he wasn’t my person, but he was probably the closest thing to that. I feel like I’m mourning the loss of something but I just don’t know what, but I know that it isn’t him. 

I feel like a complete AH because I don’t want to feel a pang of sadness every time I see them together, especially when I am genuinely happy for them. Is this weird from me? What should I do? I don’t want to remove my cousin off socials (I don’t see his stuff because he blocked me when he first cut me off) because she’s my family and I really want to have a good relationship with her one day. Just before this all happened we were speaking about getting a coffee and being present in each other’s lives so it would be a real shame to have to cut myself off from the situation.

This is what helped me but might not work for everyone. 

Skin type: combination, thin, sensitive, caucasian 

Current skin care for the past 6 months: clean face daily with micellar cleansing water. Clean face once a week in the shower (AFTER washing my hair) with St Ives rose/aloe light scrub followed by Neutrogena hydroboost cleanser. Then I put on Cetaphil gentle SA moisturizer Salacylic acid acne treatment (one of their newer products) and then if my face is still feeling dry, Ill put on Burts Bees Skin balancing gel cream. After a picking session, Ill spray my face liberally with Avene thermal spring water (LITERALLY SUCH A GAME CHANGER).

Mantras and mindset: Ive been practicing loving myself and my body and have started treating my body like I would a friend or stranger. What I mean by that is, I wouldn't slap a stranger on the street or scratch their skin until they bleed. If they were sad Id invite them in for a hot coffee and a movie. So, if I'm sad like that, Ill get a hot coffee and put on a movie. I try think to myself, ""this isnt my body, this is future Krumpetkrooper11's body, I don't want her to be sad, so Ill walk away from the mirror"". I'm a people pleaser so if I can pretend I'm not picking to help someone else, then it's so much better than the self hatrid we've all come to know. Y'know, the whole ""wow I just spent 2 hours picking, I'm  a failure"" spiral. 

To know is to understand: realizing that SEBUM IS HEALTHY and is a NATURAL PART OF YOUR BODYS DEFENSE against microbes, bacteria, infection, allergens etc. Now whenever I see my pores, I don't squeeze the living bejesus out of them just to get sebum out. I remind myself that it is Krumpetkrooper11s bodys defense system and to leave it alone.

Important notes: 

St Ives is usually looked down on, which is fair, but I find that a deep cleanse once a week helps my skin stay smooth.

I wash my face after washing my hair because everytime I wash my hair, shampoo and conditioner gets on my face and it makes me feel super icky. The scrub gets rid of the conditioner oil that seeps into my face area

I've been picking since the age of 10 and while I am on medication for anxiety and have left my toxic household years ago, picking is something I still struggle with.

Topics I think everyone with skin picking disorders should look into include: what brands to avoid, what is a healthy skin barrier, why even oily skin needs moisturizer, what actually causes acne (food, lifestyle, other infections), simple is better skincare routines, skin care not being regulated by the fda or any health authorities, and skin care cross reactions (care products that interact with eachother and make the skin worse). 

And so yes I do still pick but I try to limit myself to just my nose or any major obvious blackheads. Now Im at the point where Ill pick lightly now and then and the next day my face is fully recovered! Actually looking better and better each day.

","Basically, capitalism sells plebians and slaves this idea that their small amount of ""earnings"" from the aristocratic class give them ""freedom"" in the form of the small consumable commodities they get to consume. The fact that many such commodities are addictive and harmful is all the better for the interests of the patricians, who need their plebs and slaves reliant on some drug only service to them can provide. Porn is an excellent example of this, but it is only one thing. There are multiple ""opiates of the masses"" these days, from television sports, reality TV, coffee (addictive and makes the workers more productive, so it was never illegalized), wine, and so on. The more you look at these patterns, the more you'll see that society is broadly based around tricking the poor into working for the rich for scores of addictive substances that the proletariat are encouraged to make their whole damn personality. 

This is why the main defense of porn/prostitution/BDSM is ""no kink-shaming"" and ""they consent"", because it's a thought-terminating cliche used to silence criticism of the wider social and psychological implications of the act.

1i1fuym,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lutheranism/comments/1i1fuym/private_confession_or_individual_therapy/,Private Confession or individual therapy ,"I'm curious, specifically from r/Lutheranism pastors/priests' opinions on private confession sessions lasting up to an hour as the penitent seeks spiritual counseling. I ask this since I have scheduled absolution meetings with pastors, which may be lengthy. Unlike Luther, who anguished for hours in confession until he understood ""Grace Alone"" in the Gospels and Letters \[e.g., Romans\], I cherish the assurance of forgiveness but also seek advice and opinion.   

Is it appropriate to expect therapeutic guidance that may last up to an hour? Sometimes, we sit in the parish garden and enjoy coffee during private confession, which I enjoy immensely.

My schedule this semester sucks. I have MWF classes and then on the days I don't have classes I'm working (except Saturday).

1i1fume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stepmom/comments/1i1fume/rant/,Rant ,"Maybe I’m a little bit ‘OCD’ but I’ve always been a bit territorial over my belongings even with roommates, SOs, whoever else. Most things don’t bother me because I essentially own more than half of the items in our house but some things get on my last nerve and I’m feeling like I have no control over my life or belongings. 

My SD is almost 18 so she’s practically her own person with a job, her own belongings, car, and the means to buy what she wants. 

 The most recent thing that gets on my nerves is her using my coffee cups (some I’ve brought from before the marriage and some gifted to me) for random drinks. We have a thousand coffee cups and I only like to use mine. She has her own cups that she’s been gifted or bought herself but it’s almost every day that she has one of mine out of the cabinet out of a thousand other options. I don’t know why it bothers me so much but honestly I just want to have my cups available to me and the thought of drinking after her makes me sick even knowing it’s going to get washed. 

Second thing is she will use the blanket I have out on the couch that I’ve already used and plan on using again when I get home and we sit down for TV time after work. We have about 20 throw blankets, I keep most of them folded in the living room on a chair for easy access. I’ll leave the one I’m currently using on the couch where I typically sit and use it for a while before washing it. I come home from work and she’s using it and when she’s done I immediately throw it in the hamper because I’m not using a blanket she had her sweaty skin on. Again, we have a million and I only use the ones I like and that are mine, why can’t she do the same?

The biggest thing that pisses me off about it is that she’s rude and disrespectful and then feels compelled to use my things anyway. I’ve tried to be a good parental figure for her and have always been shit on for it and now the resentment and discontent is stronger than ever. 

If I were to even mention anything about it, I would be scrutinized so I guess I just have to get over it. How do live with this? ",2,1736887042.0,Stepmom,5,0.63,False
1i1fufh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShrugLifeSyndicate/comments/1i1fufh/hm_therapy_notes_2/,[HM] Therapy Notes 2 ,"What time should we leave to be there on time ?” Corey asked from his position at the kitchen table .                                                                 
It was early morning, but Tessa and her boyfriend had risen and started their day happily . They were going over plans for the weekend . Corey liked to keep a tight itinerary and always made sure that the two stayed on track .                                                                            
Tessa had been making breakfast and coffee for them both as her partner made the “To do List,”. She carefully cut the stick of salted butter into even slices before adding a few to the pan . It took a minute or so, but the butter started to melt . She loved the way melted butter smelled because it could be flavored any way and still be good .                
Butter was a precursor to any food she cooked and she thought about its importance to the quality of a dish . Butter is used to sauté, fry, bake , flavor , and in sauces. She watched it sizzle a little before breaking two eggs over the hot pan .                                    
After getting the eggs on , she grabbed the bread from the counter and popped two pieces into the toaster oven . Butter would also be used to spread on their toast . The importance of butter was really unmatched .                                                                             
She turned to get the milk out of the refrigerator and headed over to her favorite place in their apartment , the coffee nook . Corey had only complained a little when she asked him to custom build the unit that would become an aesthetically pleasing piece of furniture for their home . She looked back at him for a minute , pen in hand , looking at something in his phone . It was likely the invitation to the gala they’d been invited to . He would ensure he knew everything they needed to know before their arrival this evening . He was always prepared .                                                                  
Tessa opened the cabinet and pulled out two mugs , positioning one underneath the espresso machine . She grabbed the milk to add to the steamer , but stopped when she noticed several gnats flying around the pot . She wrinkled her nose .                                                                                   
How many of them were there ? She realized that there were spots of dried up coffee spillage stuck to the base of the machine . She grabbed a dish cloth to clean the mess .                                                   
“I think it was 7pm, though I’m sure you already figured that out . Where did all of these fruit flies come from ?” She finally responded to her boyfriend who dutifully continued his own task without waiting for her to answer.                                     
He looked up at her . She seemed bewildered . She was buzzing about the kitchen like the little flying insects she had mentioned , from one place to another .                                                                              
Corey answered her , but Tessa didnt acknowledge him .                                                                                     
“Have you seen my glasses ?” She asked him for the third time that morning . He laughed and pointed to her head where they were resting , holding back her hair . What would she do without him ?                                                                                    
She looked at the gnats for longer than anyone normally would . These little bugs were feeding off of espresso . It felt wrong ! It was the equivalent of giving a pound of cocaine to a child . She chuckled to herself , not caring when Corey gave her a look of concern.                                                                         
**”Oh no the giant is wiping up the nectar!” Freud screamed . His wings were erratic and he almost dived right into a dark hole that the large creature had pulled from an unknown place .                                  
“She seems like she won’t hurt us, we may be able to get a little bit more before it is all gone!” Jung , Freud’s slightly younger brother yelled back !                       
Freud couldn’t resist his impulse , he knew it was dangerous, but he dived anyway . The nectar was too good . His mind was fluttering back and forth as to whether or not this was a good idea , but it was his body that betrayed him .                                      
Jung flew around in circles , hovering before joining his brother . All of the other gnats following their lead .                                                                            
“The giantess is looking at us, we must hurry . “ Freud observed . “This stuff is just too good . I feel like I could knock her down if I tried !”                           
Jung took his own helping of the bitter nectar , he understood the energetic feeling that his brother was feeling and wondered if others felt it too . Were they all struggling between the choice of obtaining more food and the likelihood that the large figure would bring them certain death .                  
Freud was the first to pull away . “I don’t think this is good for us .” He buzzed higher and higher until he was as far away from the sticky sweetness as he could be .                                                                      
Jung laughed . “You’re right . It made you feel invincible against an impossible adversary.”
Freud flew back and forth as fast as he could . “I feel like I could do anything right now .”                             
“Children please, please . Take no more . It is affecting our minds ,” Piaget yelled. He flew in a figure eight around the group of youngest gnats , gathering them up , and studying how they behaved .                                                                             
“Weeeee, look at me ! I’m really really fast!” One of them said !                                                                        
“We want more! More ! More!” The youngest of the bunch excitedly yelled!                                                     
“Oh don’t be such a hero— we all know that you’re the caregiver!” Jung exclaimed . Piaget annoyed him . Was his younger brother acting out of character , or was a caregiver also a hero ?                   
“Jung is right . I’d like to see how they behave after eating the substance,” Watson , who hadn’t had any of the nectar , decided .                                               
The children dipped down to lick up the black goo and let their wings carry them towards their elders .                                                                               
“I want you all to fly as fast as you can,” Pavlov directed . He also had not had any food yet .               
The children , and some adults , did as they were told .                                                                                      
“More ! More!” They cheered .                                         
“Whatever . I guess Pavlov is in charge now,“ Piaget said .                                                                                   
“We can only get the nectar when the giantess has her back turned .” Pavlov directed all of the others .
The giant began to move back towards whatever smelled so good far away from the food they’d been enjoying . Pavlov thought that the adults could have some of that next .                                        
“Her back is turned. Let’s go !” Everyone dived down to get whatever they could before their new deadline .                                                                           
Each time they did , Pavlov did not move . He just began to sing loudly .                                                      
“Lalalala!”                                                                           
The group flew down to get more!                                       
As the giant moved around the planet , Pavlov continued this pattern of singing each time their back was turned .                                                              
“Lalala!”                                                                             
This happened over and over until all of the gnats were taking part.                                                                 
Just then his brother, Zimbardo, had an idea .
Zimbardo sung “lalala!” as loud as he could, but the giantesses back was not turned .                        

All of the gnats descended to the nectar , where they were smashed by a large white blanket that the creature was wielding .                                             
He laughed as he watched hot liquid pour into the large white colored tunnel that had been sitting beside the nectar pit .                                                      
“Guess Freud was wrong , we aren’t stronger than the giant .”**.                                                                              
“Hello earth to Tessa! The eggs are burning !” Corey broke Tessa out of her day dream .                         
She ran to the eggs , but Corey had already saved them .                                                                            In the time it took to cook two eggs and two pieces of toast , she’d held a conversation , had deep thoughts about the culinary wonders of butter , found her glasses , vividly daydreamed a life for psychologist gnats , cleaned the kitchen and gotten rid of most of the pests , confirmed plans , and made cappuccino’s.                                       
 
She stared out of the window at the snowy foliage, watching a squirrel scurry up a tree . She thought about the crazy little guy from the movie ice age , before turning her attention to spreading butter on the toast and plating the meal .                                     
As she set the table for the both of them, she sat down next to Corey, giggling .                                          
“What ?” He smiled .                                                         
“I think I have some kind of attention disorder. You know neurodivergence?”                                                 
Corey laughed uncontrollably , handing her the glasses he’d helped her locate , that she had taken off of her head and set down again .

My ex and I dated almost three years ago for about five months. It was a bad relationship; he cheated on me. I found him on Tinder, and though he swore he was just looking and didn’t actually meet anyone, I ended things. He was apologetic and tried subtly to reconnect a few times. We met twice after the breakup over the span of two years, just for coffee and dinner as friends. However, the second time, he tried to hold my hand, which made me feel uneasy, so I decided not to meet him again.

He still occasionally texts me, wishes me happy birthday or sends New Year’s greetings etc., but I keep my responses short and neutral. While he’s not overly pushy, I get the impression he wants to get back together, not out of love, but just for casual dating. I’ve completely moved on, and honestly, I can’t believe I ever dated him. Over time, I’ve realized he’s manipulative and not a good person.

Now, I’ve developed feelings for this new guy, only to find out that he’s good friends with my ex. They were classmates in school and still stay in touch and hang out often.

Would my history with my ex affect how this guy sees me? As a man, how would you feel if you were in his shoes?",3,1736886633.0,LifeAdvice,5,0.81,False

I had a few different ideas of what to expect, as the cab dropped me at the front of my grandfather's property, but the amount of trees and overgrown shrubs was rather surprising. The driveway was about a quarter mile long, and the whole walk down, there was no gaps between the twigs and foliage. 

About 60 yards from the house, the trees started clearing up to show an empty yard with a large brick patio. Of course it didn't look very empty, with how long the grass was. The patio needed maintenance, also: bricks were broken, chairs were rotten, and hanging plants had been dead for some time. 

How long had Grandpa been sick? And did he not have anyone else, out here, that could maintain the property? 

Well, I guess that's why I was notified. I wonder if the inside of the house looked any better. 

I walked up to the front door and froze. Do I knock? Do I just go in? Until now, this all felt like a dream, but as soon as I touch this door, I know reality will fall over me, like a heavy blanket.

As I reached for the knob, the door opened. I jumped back a little as I saw a man, who could not be my grandpa. He was maybe 35, in a navy blue suit. He carried a briefcase that I'm sure held all his emotions, since on his face he wore the most shallow smile I'd ever seen. This was the attorney. 

""Hi, you must be Gregory! My name's David."" He said, his smile widening, as he put out a very stiff hand for me to shake. 

After I reciprocated, he gestured for me to follow him into the house. 

Most all the lights were off, but with the sun shining through the windows, I could see how... stagnant the house looked. All objects were discolored from the amount of dust coating them. I feared touching anything, as it may result in a mobile dust cloud. 

David lead me to a study where we could sit and discuss my grandfather. 

""Alright,"" he said opening his briefcase, ""first off, thank you for being here on time. I'm used to these types of meetings, and sometimes I have to stay for a few days for a loved one to show up. Which is usually fine, but being out here in the thicket just gives me the heebie-jeebies. I guess that's just the city-boy in me."" 

He chuckled, but cleared his throat and changed the conversation, ""So anyway, I do apologize, I am pretty new to Ham's file. This thing had more dust on it than this house does! He made it about 25 years ago, and has never updated it."" He started turning pages, ""Well, I mean, he did everything to keep it relevant, but the one thing that always stayed the same was you. That you get everything, if you just come take care of Ham during his final time here on Earth."" 

He looked at me, expecting some sort of emotion. Or maybe any questions. But I just sat there quietly. He turned a few more pages, ""Okie doke, well that's about everything that relates to you, in this file, so if you could just sign here, stating you were informed, I can get out of your hair."" 

I signed all his forms, and asked, ""So... where's my grandfather now?"" 

David collected his papers and stood up, ""Oh, I do suppose that's something we haven't discussed. So now that these are signed,"" he held up his brief case, ""I can call the retirement and rehab facility in town, and a hospice nurse will get Ham scheduled to be moved back out here."" 

""How soon would that take?

He strolled to the front door, ""To get him back out here? Well it's a Thursday, so he could be back in the house tomorrow. Lucky it's not a weekend. Nobody would come out here on the weekend."" 

""Do you happen to know what his... condition is?"" 

David now stood on the porch. His eyes squinted, like he was remembering, ""I'm sure the nurse could tell you better, when they drop him off, but from what I heard, it was a stroke."" 

That scared me a little. I wasn't sure I knew how to take care of a stroke recovery patient. I guess I'll be talking with that hospice nurse quite a bit. 

I was so lost in thought that I barely heard David as he walked down the steps, ""I'm surprised he survived actually, at his age. Most 98-years-olds couldn't come back from something like that."" 

That made me chuckle. Must have been where my brother Jeremy got his genetics. My twin brother never got sick. He's even fallen from great heights and never broke a bone. Meanwhile I can't even eat eggs without going into anaphylactic shock. 

""You must really be special"" David said. Again, jolting me from my thoughts. Have they been thoughts? Had I been talking out loud? 

"" Huh?"" I said, caught off guard.

""Don't be offended, but I read through Ham's family records. He has two daughters, another grandson, and many in-laws that live out of state. He could have left his property to anyone. Or to all of y'all to fight over. But he chose you. You two must have a special bond."" 

With that, David finally turned and walked down the driveway. I saw him take out his cellphone, most likely to call a cab, or maybe the retirement home. 

That meant I had the rest of today to explore this property, and see if this house was even worth keeping after grandpa died. 

But first, I was hungry. I went back into the house and quickly found the kitchen. Most everything in the fridge was rotten or expired, and the pantry had mice. Well that would be first on my to-do list in this house, I decided. 

I filled a trash bag with old fruits, vegetables, and every box in the pantry that had a hole chewed in it. As I walked the bag out the side door, something caught my eye. 

It was my name. My name on a sticky note attached to a key. A key that definitely went to a vehicle. The attorney didn't go over this at all. As I took the key off the hook, I noticed my name again, this time on an envelope, on the counter. I opened the envelope and pulled out a piece of paper. As I did, a credit card fell out. 

The paper simply said, ""Don't go too crazy"". 

I stood there in disbelief. How could this be real? So many things ran through my head but the one that stuck out the most was my brother. Jeremy had worked so hard for his first car. He got it when he was 15, and did weeks if not months of manual labor to get enough money for it. And how excited he was to get his first real paycheck. He used it to take Mom out to dinner. 

I suddenly remembered how hungry I was. I stuffed the credit card into my pocket and ran outside to see if I could find a vehicle that matched this key. 

Right out the side door was a two-door garage. It held three vehicles: A '73 Pontiac Catalina, the station wagon model, an '82 Buick Riviera, *GOSH* I begged for that to be mine, but I could tell, with as new as this key looked, it had to belong to the '95 Acura. 

My heart sank just a little, but it was still a car, and it was still mine. Time to cruise into town, and see what the local food was like. 

The town was cute. Very Hallmark. The streets were clean. Every store was open and inviting. Even the families seemed like they jumped right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. As I was stopped at a light, a husband and wife walked across, smiling and holding hands, with their twin girls skipping along, in front of them. They all wore matching coats. The girls had tight golden locks. 

Passed the family, I decided to stop as Marla's Diner. It was pretty crowded so I figured the food must be good. 

Inside, the diner was just as picturesque as the streets. Families, dressed their best, took up half the booths. The mailman stood at the bar, chatting up the local sheriff. And waitresses, sporting old-school diner attire, swarmed the facility accordingly.

I was suddenly aware that I probably stood out like a sore thumb. I was still in the same slacks and button-up shirt that I had worn to dinner, the night before. Who knew what the condition of my hair was. Even if it were all in my head, I could feel the eyes judging me, and I quickly dipped into a booth in the back corner. 

A waitress immediately came up to me, ""Hey there hon, can I get you anything to start with? Coffee? Orange juice? Something stronger?"" She gave me a humourous wink. 

I blushed, and asked for tea. She quickly went to retrieve my beverage. 

As I sat, I noticed many people taking glances at me. Did I really look that awful? I turned my face to the window and tried smashing my hair down into a presentable style. 

""Excuse me"" came a soft voice from behind me. 

I turned to see an older woman standing there. She was short, with your classic snow-white perm, with a little purple pill box cap on top. She had a matching purple pantsuit, and bamboo purse. Beyond her, I saw at least six booth occupants watching our interaction. 

""Y-yes ma'am?"" I was very unsure of what she would say. 

""You look pretty new to the town. You wouldn't happen to be dear Ham's grandson would you?"" 

Again I said, ""Yes ma'am."" 

Her eyes lit up, and without asking, took a seat next to me, leaving her husband in another booth. A few other women came and sat across from us. 

""Oh, it's so nice to meet you!"" She said, ""My name's Sheryl, and these,"" pointing to the other two women who joined *our* booth, ""are Jasmine and Rachel. We're big fans of your grandfather.""

""Oh he's such a wonderful man."" Jasmine stated, ""We were very sorry to hear about his stroke.""

""In fact all of us in the diner, sort of, idolize him,"" Rachel chimed in, ""he's just such a wonderful teacher."" 

""Oh...um that's great. What exactly does my grandfather teach.?"" 

The women all looked at each other. Sheryl responded, ""Oh, just about everything. He's just so knowledgeable. Almost like he's on a spiritual level."" The ladies all giggled. 

At that moment, the waitress came back with my tea, ""I see you made some friends. Did you have an idea of what you'd like to eat?"" 

I hadn't even had time to look at the menu, but I knew what I wanted. I'd been craving bacon for a while, ""Yeah, could I get a lumberjack breakfast, but instead of eggs, can I just get more strips of bacon?"" 

The women at my booth went silent, and kind of eyed each other, and then looked at the waitress. 

The waitress said, ""Well, we don't carry eggs here anyway, hon, so I'll get that order out as soon as I can."" She gave me another wink, and turned back to the kitchen. 

The women all sighed and went back to there little giggles. I took a moment, to open the menu and did notice there definitely wasn't any eggs available in any dishes. Not even as ingredients. No hollandaise sauce, and the pancakes and waffles were made with bananas as a substitute. I personally love breakfast food, and since I'm allergic to eggs, this might be my new favorite restaurant in town. 

""By the way, you never told us your name, son"" Sheryl said sweetly. 

I took at sip of my tea, their eyes staring at me, almost in admiration. ""Um. Gregory."" 

""Gregory"" they all said in unison. 

Sheryl then shouted to her husband, ""This is Gregory! He's Ham's grandson!"" 

Suddenly a few other folks in the diner came over to shake my hand and introduce themselves. One mom brought her twin boys over to meet me. 

Definitely having never been the center of attention, I had no idea how to act. I tried making small talk with the twin boys, saying how I was a twin too. They just giggled and ran back to their seats. 

""Alright, alright, y'all leave this young man alone so he can enjoy the best hash-browns he's ever tasted,"" my waitress was back. As she placed the meal in front of me, the crowd dispersed. 

The only one left was Sheryl. ""Well, I guess we'll see you around town then, and definitely up at the ch- at your grandfather's place. It was very nice to meet you."" She got up and went back to her husband's booth.

The hasbrowns were good. The bacon was better. I ate the last strip, as I wrote a shopping list on a napkin. 

The town's grocery store was only a few blocks from the diner. Considering my grandfather's condition, I decided to stock up on broths, smoothies, and other things that were easy to eat. Perhaps I'd even look for a food processor or blender. If there's one at the house, I'm sure it's outdated. 

Down one aisle, a short, older man stopped and talked with me. Apparently word travels very fast here. He thanked me for coming to town, and how sweet I was to be taking care of my grandfather. I just shrugged and said it wasn't a big deal. As the little man turned to walk away, his posture made me remember that I needed to stop down the handy-man aisle and get some mousetraps.

My ex and I dated almost three years ago for about five months. It was a bad relationship; he cheated on me. I found him on Tinder, and though he swore he was just looking and didn’t actually meet anyone, I ended things. He was apologetic and tried subtly to reconnect a few times. We met twice after the breakup over the span of two years, just for coffee and dinner as friends. However, the second time, he tried to hold my hand, which made me feel uneasy, so I decided not to meet him again.

He still occasionally texts me, wishes me happy birthday or sends New Year’s greetings, but I keep my responses short and neutral. While he’s not overly pushy, I get the impression he wants to get back together, not out of love, but just for casual dating. I’ve completely moved on, and honestly, I can’t believe I ever dated him. Over time, I’ve realized he’s manipulative and not a good person.

Now, I’ve developed feelings for this new guy, only to find out that he’s good friends with my ex. They were classmates in school and still stay in touch and hang out often.

Would my history with my ex affect how this guy sees me? As a man, how would you feel if you were in his shoes?",3,1736886285.0,AskMenAdvice,6,1.0,False

1i1fho8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i1fho8/hm_therapy_notes_2/,[HM] Therapy Notes 2 ,"What time should we leave to be there on time ?” Corey asked from his position at the kitchen table .                                                                 
It was early morning, but Tessa and her boyfriend had risen and started their day happily . They were going over plans for the weekend . Corey liked to keep a tight itinerary and always made sure that the two stayed on track .                                                                            
Tessa had been making breakfast and coffee for them both as her partner made the “To do List,”. She carefully cut the stick of salted butter into even slices before adding a few to the pan . It took a minute or so, but the butter started to melt . She loved the way melted butter smelled because it could be flavored any way and still be good .                
Butter was a precursor to any food she cooked and she thought about its importance to the quality of a dish . Butter is used to sauté, fry, bake , flavor , and in sauces. She watched it sizzle a little before breaking two eggs over the hot pan .                                    
After getting the eggs on , she grabbed the bread from the counter and popped two pieces into the toaster oven . Butter would also be used to spread on their toast . The importance of butter was really unmatched .                                                                             
She turned to get the milk out of the refrigerator and headed over to her favorite place in their apartment , the coffee nook . Corey had only complained a little when she asked him to custom build the unit that would become an aesthetically pleasing piece of furniture for their home . She looked back at him for a minute , pen in hand , looking at something in his phone . It was likely the invitation to the gala they’d been invited to . He would ensure he knew everything they needed to know before their arrival this evening . He was always prepared .                                                                  
Tessa opened the cabinet and pulled out two mugs , positioning one underneath the espresso machine . She grabbed the milk to add to the steamer , but stopped when she noticed several gnats flying around the pot . She wrinkled her nose .                                                                                   
How many of them were there ? She realized that there were spots of dried up coffee spillage stuck to the base of the machine . She grabbed a dish cloth to clean the mess .                                                   
“I think it was 7pm, though I’m sure you already figured that out . Where did all of these fruit flies come from ?” She finally responded to her boyfriend who dutifully continued his own task without waiting for her to answer.                                     
He looked up at her . She seemed bewildered . She was buzzing about the kitchen like the little flying insects she had mentioned , from one place to another .                                                                              
Corey answered her , but Tessa didnt acknowledge him .                                                                                     
“Have you seen my glasses ?” She asked him for the third time that morning . He laughed and pointed to her head where they were resting , holding back her hair . What would she do without him ?                                                                                    
She looked at the gnats for longer than anyone normally would . These little bugs were feeding off of espresso . It felt wrong ! It was the equivalent of giving a pound of cocaine to a child . She chuckled to herself , not caring when Corey gave her a look of concern.                                                                         
**”Oh no the giant is wiping up the nectar!” Freud screamed . His wings were erratic and he almost dived right into a dark hole that the large creature had pulled from an unknown place .                                  
“She seems like she won’t hurt us, we may be able to get a little bit more before it is all gone!” Jung , Freud’s slightly younger brother yelled back !                       
Freud couldn’t resist his impulse , he knew it was dangerous, but he dived anyway . The nectar was too good . His mind was fluttering back and forth as to whether or not this was a good idea , but it was his body that betrayed him .                                      
Jung flew around in circles , hovering before joining his brother . All of the other gnats following their lead .                                                                            
“The giantess is looking at us, we must hurry . “ Freud observed . “This stuff is just too good . I feel like I could knock her down if I tried !”                           
Jung took his own helping of the bitter nectar , he understood the energetic feeling that his brother was feeling and wondered if others felt it too . Were they all struggling between the choice of obtaining more food and the likelihood that the large figure would bring them certain death .                  
Freud was the first to pull away . “I don’t think this is good for us .” He buzzed higher and higher until he was as far away from the sticky sweetness as he could be .                                                                      
Jung laughed . “You’re right . It made you feel invincible against an impossible adversary.”
Freud flew back and forth as fast as he could . “I feel like I could do anything right now .”                             
“Children please, please . Take no more . It is affecting our minds ,” Piaget yelled. He flew in a figure eight around the group of youngest gnats , gathering them up , and studying how they behaved .                                                                             
“Weeeee, look at me ! I’m really really fast!” One of them said !                                                                        
“We want more! More ! More!” The youngest of the bunch excitedly yelled!                                                     
“Oh don’t be such a hero— we all know that you’re the caregiver!” Jung exclaimed . Piaget annoyed him . Was his younger brother acting out of character , or was a caregiver also a hero ?                   
“Jung is right . I’d like to see how they behave after eating the substance,” Watson , who hadn’t had any of the nectar , decided .                                               
The children dipped down to lick up the black goo and let their wings carry them towards their elders .                                                                               
“I want you all to fly as fast as you can,” Pavlov directed . He also had not had any food yet .               
The children , and some adults , did as they were told .                                                                                      
“More ! More!” They cheered .                                         
“Whatever . I guess Pavlov is in charge now,“ Piaget said .                                                                                   
“We can only get the nectar when the giantess has her back turned .” Pavlov directed all of the others .
The giant began to move back towards whatever smelled so good far away from the food they’d been enjoying . Pavlov thought that the adults could have some of that next .                                        
“Her back is turned. Let’s go !” Everyone dived down to get whatever they could before their new deadline .                                                                           
Each time they did , Pavlov did not move . He just began to sing loudly .                                                      
“Lalalala!”                                                                           
The group flew down to get more!                                       
As the giant moved around the planet , Pavlov continued this pattern of singing each time their back was turned .                                                              
“Lalala!”                                                                             
This happened over and over until all of the gnats were taking part.                                                                 
Just then his brother, Zimbardo, had an idea .
Zimbardo sung “lalala!” as loud as he could, but the giantesses back was not turned .                        

All of the gnats descended to the nectar , where they were smashed by a large white blanket that the creature was wielding .                                             
He laughed as he watched hot liquid pour into the large white colored tunnel that had been sitting beside the nectar pit .                                                      
“Guess Freud was wrong , we aren’t stronger than the giant .”**.                                                                              
“Hello earth to Tessa! The eggs are burning !” Corey broke Tessa out of her day dream .                         
She ran to the eggs , but Corey had already saved them .                                                                            In the time it took to cook two eggs and two pieces of toast , she’d held a conversation , had deep thoughts about the culinary wonders of butter , found her glasses , vividly daydreamed a life for psychologist gnats , cleaned the kitchen and gotten rid of most of the pests , confirmed plans , and made cappuccino’s.                                       
 
She stared out of the window at the snowy foliage, watching a squirrel scurry up a tree . She thought about the crazy little guy from the movie ice age , before turning her attention to spreading butter on the toast and plating the meal .                                     
As she set the table for the both of them, she sat down next to Corey, giggling .                                          
“What ?” He smiled .                                                         
“I think I have some kind of attention disorder. You know neurodivergence?”

No, it’s not magic—it’s math. If you improve by just 1% every day, by this time next year, you’ll be 37 times better than where you started. But here’s the catch: progress doesn’t come from massive leaps or dramatic reinventions. It’s built from small, consistent wins that compound over time.

January 1st hits, and the world seems to collectively decide it’s time to transform—cue the gym sign-ups, kale smoothie recipes, and the unmistakable sound of planners being filled with impossibly neat handwriting. It’s like we’ve all been cast in a global production called *New Year, New Me,* and the stakes are sky-high.

The problem isn’t setting goals—it’s the pressure to completely reinvent yourself overnight. Spoiler alert: you don’t need a ""new you."" The current you is already pretty great—just a little tired from the holiday chaos.

So, what if this year wasn’t about perfection? What if it was about meaningful, manageable changes that fit into real life? Small wins that build over time. Progress that doesn’t demand you overhaul your entire existence. Whether you’re dreaming big or keeping it simple, this guide is here to help you start where you are, one step at a time, no pressure required.

Why do so many resolutions fizzle out? Studies show that **80% of resolutions fail by mid-February**, and only **9% of people stick with them long-term.** It’s not because we’re lazy; it’s because we’re aiming for vague and often unrealistic goals without a roadmap.

Think about it. Big, lofty goals like 'Get healthy,' 'Be more productive,' or 'Save money' sound inspiring, but they’re so vague it’s impossible to know where to start. And when you don’t see immediate results, your brain—wired for instant gratification—hits the panic button. According to psychologist Dr. John Norcross, a leading expert on behavior change, most people give up on resolutions because they lack a clear plan and set themselves up for failure by trying to do too much, too fast.

There’s also a psychological phenomenon at play called the **‘false hope syndrome.’** Coined by researchers Janet Polivy and C. Peter Herman, this concept explains how setting overly ambitious goals creates an unrealistic expectation of rapid transformation. When reality inevitably doesn’t match those expectations, we feel defeated and give up entirely.

And let’s not forget the January pressure cooker. We’re told this is the *one* time of year to change our lives, as if the entire success of 2025 hinges on how much kale we eat or how many gym sessions we rack up in the first month. But life doesn’t work like that. It’s messy, unpredictable, and sometimes, just downright exhausting.

So here’s the good news: You don’t need to have it all figured out by January 1st. In fact, you don’t need to have it figured out at all. Research shows that **focusing on small, specific, and actionable steps**—like drinking one extra glass of water a day or going for a 10-minute walk—leads to far greater success than sweeping, vague resolutions. These smaller goals feel achievable, which triggers a sense of accomplishment and motivates you to keep going. It’s a concept behavioral scientist BJ Fogg calls **‘tiny habits.’**

And here’s the kicker: messing up doesn’t mean you’ve failed—it means you’re human. The key to long-term success isn’t perfection; it’s consistency. One skipped workout or one missed goal isn’t the end—it’s just a pause. The next step is always what matters most.

So, what if we stopped treating resolutions like a test we’re destined to fail? What if, instead of focusing on perfection, we focused on showing up—even imperfectly? Maybe it’s organizing one drawer instead of tackling the whole house. Or jotting down a single thought in a journal instead of writing a full entry. Those small wins matter more than you think. And science agrees.



# Your Roadmap to Real Progress: Small Wins, Big Results

Okay, so we’ve established that resolutions don’t need to be grandiose to be effective. But what does that actually look like? How do you set goals that fit into real life, not just the fantasy version where you have endless time, energy, and willpower?

Here’s your roadmap to real progress. No pressure, no guilt—just a few simple, science-backed strategies to help you make small, meaningful changes that actually stick.""

# 1. Start With One Micro-Action

The easiest way to get started is by tackling something so simple it feels almost *too* easy. Why? Because early success builds momentum and gives you the confidence to keep going.

*Examples*:

* Want to improve your sleep? Start by dimming your lights an hour before bed to signal your brain it’s time to wind down.
* Hoping to feel more grounded? Write down one thing that went well today before bed—no matter how small.
* Want to move more? Stretch for 30 seconds while waiting for your coffee to brew.

Insight:**The trick is to focus on something you already do and make it** ***just a little bit better.*** **Over time, these small tweaks can transform your habits without feeling like a massive overhaul.**



# 2. Set Time-Based Goals, Not Results-Based Ones

Instead of setting a specific outcome goal, focus on the time you dedicate to an activity. Research shows that prioritizing effort over results helps build sustainable habits without the pressure of immediate success.

*Examples*:

* Instead of ""Clean the entire house,"" set a timer for 15 minutes and tackle whatever you can.
* Instead of ""Learn a new language,"" dedicate 10 minutes a day to practicing vocabulary or listening to a podcast in that language.

Insight:**This approach feels achievable, removes the pressure of perfection, and keeps you focused on showing up. Over time, the consistency pays off in ways you’ll actually notice.**



# 3. Pair It With Joy

Here’s the thing about goals: They shouldn’t feel like punishment. If you’re not enjoying it, you won’t stick to it. Inject joy into the process to keep it sustainable.

*Examples*:

* Want to move more? Put on your favorite playlist and dance it out.
* Trying to eat more veggies? Experiment with fun recipes, like roasting broccoli with garlic and parmesan or blending spinach into a smoothie you’ll actually want to drink.
* Want to spend less time on your phone? Trade 10 minutes of scrolling for an activity you genuinely enjoy—like doodling, playing with your pet, or making a cup of tea.

Insight:**When you associate your goal with something positive, it stops feeling like a chore and starts feeling like something you** ***want*** **to do.**

**4. Embrace the Power of the Reset**

Most of us think if we mess up once, the whole thing’s ruined. But here’s a better way to think about it: Every day, every hour, every moment is a chance to reset.

*Examples*:

* Skipped your meditation? Close your eyes for one deep breath during your next break.
* Ordered takeout instead of cooking? Add a side of veggies or drink a glass of water alongside it.
* Forgot to check off your to-do list? Write down one task you accomplished today, even if it wasn’t planned.

Insight:**Instead of aiming for 'perfect,' aim for 'better.' Progress doesn’t have to be linear—it just has to keep moving forward.**



# Mini Action Plan: 3 Tiny Wins to Try Today

Here are three quick, tailored actions to help you start building momentum, no matter your style or situation:

* **For the Overthinker**: Write down one thing you’re grateful for. Focusing on a single positive thought can help quiet the noise and ground your mind.
* **For the Busy Bee**: Listen to an audiobook or podcast during your commute. Make that time productive or inspiring instead of stressful.
* **For the Procrastinator**: Set a timer for 5 minutes and tackle the task you’ve been avoiding—just starting often makes it less intimidating.

**Bonus Wins:**

* Feeling overwhelmed? Step outside for 2 minutes of fresh air to reset.
* Need motivation? Watch a short video or read a quote that inspires you.
* Feeling disconnected? Send a quick text to someone you care about.

  


# Progress Over Perfection: The Only Resolution That Matters

Life isn’t a perfectly edited montage of big wins and dramatic transformations. It’s a messy mix of little victories, occasional setbacks, and a whole lot of in-between moments. And honestly? That’s where the magic happens.

This year, instead of chasing perfection, try this: aim for progress. Tiny steps forward. Small wins that snowball into something bigger. It’s not about getting it 'right' every time—it’s about showing up, trying, and giving yourself grace when things don’t go as planned.



# How to Keep Progress Front and Center

* **1. Think Themes, Not Resolutions**Resolutions can feel rigid, but themes give you direction without the pressure. Choose a single word or phrase that captures how you want to feel this year—like 'ease,' 'growth,' or 'joy.' Let that theme guide your choices without boxing you in.
* **2. Break the Year Into Bite-Sized Goals**Instead of planning your entire year in January, take it one month at a time. Maybe January is about rest, February is about movement, and March is about creativity. By focusing on one thing at a time, you’ll feel less overwhelmed and more accomplished.
* **3. Track the Wins, Not Just the Goals**Keep a 'done' list instead of just a 'to-do' list. Every time you accomplish something—big or small—write it down. It’s a simple way to see your progress and remind yourself of how far you’ve come.



# 37 Times Better: The Math of Small Wins

Here’s a little perspective: If you improve by just 1% every day, you’ll be approximately **37.78 times better** than where you started. That’s the power of consistency. It’s not about making huge leaps—it’s about small, meaningful actions that compound over time.

# The Math Behind It

If you improve by 1% every day, that’s like multiplying your progress by 1.01 each day. Over 365 days, this small improvement compounds exponentially:

**1.01**^(365) **= 37.78**

This means that consistent, incremental progress grows at an astonishing rate over time. The magic isn’t in making massive leaps but in stacking small, meaningful improvements day after day.



# How Small Wins Create Big Momentum

Each small, positive choice you make doesn’t just improve your day—it builds habits, reinforces confidence, and creates momentum. This compounding effect turns micro-actions into something much bigger than the sum of their parts.

* **Example 1**: Choosing veggies over fries isn’t just about the calories. It’s a decision that reinforces your belief in your ability to make choices aligned with your goals.
* **Example 2**: Pausing to breathe deeply during a stressful moment might feel insignificant, but it reduces stress and builds a habit of mindfulness.
* **Example 3**: Writing a single paragraph might not seem like progress toward writing a novel, but it’s a step that builds consistency and trust in your ability to keep showing up.

These small wins ripple outward, creating a foundation for lasting change.



# Why Small Wins Are Easy to Underestimate

It’s tempting to dismiss these tiny actions as too small to matter. But over time, they’re what lead to real, sustainable transformation. They chip away at old patterns, replace them with new ones, and prove to yourself that progress is possible.

# Celebrate Every Step

Every positive choice—no matter how small—is a step toward becoming **37 times better** than you were yesterday. These wins deserve to be celebrated, whether it’s a moment of mindfulness, a healthier food choice, or sticking with a goal long enough to see it through. Progress isn’t about dramatic leaps forward; it’s about small, steady steps that build a life you’re proud of.

So, give yourself credit. These little victories are more than enough, and they’re worth acknowledging.



**A Gentle Reminder**

Your worth isn’t tied to how many goals you crush or how perfectly you stick to your plans. You’re allowed to rest. You’re allowed to pivot. You’re allowed to simply be.

The best resolution you can make? Be kind to yourself. Show up when you can. Reset when you need to. Celebrate the moments where you tried, even if the outcome wasn’t perfect.

Remember: Progress—even the tiniest bit—is always enough. Each small step forward is a testament to your resilience and capacity for growth. So, take a breath, acknowledge how far you’ve already come, and keep moving in the direction that feels right for you. Small wins add up. Celebrate them—you’re already so much closer than you think.

  
  
**Imagine Being 37 Times Better by Next Year**

No, it’s not magic—it’s math. If you improve by just 1% every day, by this time next year, you’ll be 37 times better than where you started. But here’s the catch: progress doesn’t come from massive leaps or dramatic reinventions. It’s built from small, consistent wins that compound over time.

January 1st hits, and the world seems to collectively decide it’s time to transform—cue the gym sign-ups, kale smoothie recipes, and the unmistakable sound of planners being filled with impossibly neat handwriting. It’s like we’ve all been cast in a global production called *New Year, New Me,* and the stakes are sky-high.

The problem isn’t setting goals—it’s the pressure to completely reinvent yourself overnight. Spoiler alert: you don’t need a ""new you."" The current you is already pretty great—just a little tired from the holiday chaos.

So, what if this year wasn’t about perfection? What if it was about meaningful, manageable changes that fit into real life? Small wins that build over time. Progress that doesn’t demand you overhaul your entire existence. Whether you’re dreaming big or keeping it simple, this guide is here to help you start where you are, one step at a time, no pressure required.",1,1736885664.0,u_ivclub,0,1.0,False

This Came to mind recently because I joined a new gym and they made me do a physical assessment to get a discount on the first year. The one thing the trainer roasted me the most about was not carrying a water bottle or bringing one to workout. I typically don't drink water during my workouts and don't like to but I don't necessarily think that means I'm not getting enough water.

I don't particularly like water bottles or carrying one around because I already have enough to carry, water bottles are hard to clean, and because I just like to have a fresh glass of filtered water - I drink it pretty quick.

I would like further help understanding and managing everything I’ve been experiencing over the past few months. It all started after I smoked weed for the first time, and since then, my health has felt like it’s spiraling out of control.

A few months ago, I smoked weed for the first time. I took a big hit, and surprisingly, I didn’t cough at all. But almost immediately, I started feeling off. My chest felt tight, my throat felt strange, and I began panicking. The experience triggered intense anxiety that lasted for weeks, and I felt like I couldn’t escape it.

For the first two or three weeks, I had full-blown panic attacks. My heart raced, my body felt strange, and I felt like I wasn’t even real anymore. It was as if I was stuck in a dream or a fog, a state of derealization that has stayed with me ever since. The anxiety eventually eased, but the physical and mental symptoms remained.

My throat was the first thing I noticed. It felt tight, swollen, and uncomfortable. The back of my throat developed a cobblestone appearance, and my tonsils became noticeably larger. The right tonsil started looking deformed, with a worm-like shape, white spots, and even white lines. I also noticed a slimy growth on the side of my throat, which became more prominent when I examined it closely.

At the same time, I started having stomach problems. I experienced frequent heartburn, sharp chest pains, and a bubbling sensation in my stomach after eating certain foods. My abdomen would hurt sometimes, but the pain would improve after I used the bathroom. One alarming incident occurred when I passed stool that looked like coffee grounds, though it only happened once.

I decided to see a doctor, who performed an endoscopy. The procedure revealed that I had gastritis and a polyp near the junction of my esophagus and stomach. I started taking medications like Cimalgel syrup and Bigetric to manage my symptoms. I’ve also been drinking aloe vera gel after finishing my medications.

Even though the medications helped somewhat, I kept noticing new symptoms. My throat often feels sticky, like mucus is stuck there, and I have to clear it constantly. Swallowing feels strange, and my throat sometimes makes cracking or clicking sounds, as if bones are rubbing together.

I’ve also noticed other changes in my mouth and throat. The roof of my mouth has a wrinkly texture, which seems to be growing. My circumvallate papillae at the back of my tongue are more noticeable, with sharp, spike-like structures that don’t bend when I press on them. I also noticed purple spots near the papillae and a white mole-like spot on the roof of my mouth.

Physically, I’ve tried to stay active by doing push-ups and sit-ups, but sometimes exercise triggers my symptoms. My throat feels tense afterward, and I worry that I’m making things worse.

My eyes have also become a concern. They burn, especially around lights, and my vision has been blurry. When I had my eyes examined, I was told they were “drained,” and further testing was recommended.

To make matters worse, my lymph nodes, which were enlarged since birth and never considered a problem, have grown bigger. I noticed a dark spot behind one of my tonsils and a feeling of something stuck in my throat that won’t go away.

Mentally, the derealization has been one of the hardest things to deal with. It’s like I’m disconnected from reality, and I sometimes feel like I might be in a coma. When I try to focus my eyes, it turns into staring into nothing, and I feel like I have little control over my body.

Despite all of this, I’ve been trying to keep going. I’ve adjusted my diet, but I still enjoy certain foods, like khachapuri or tea with sugar. I’ve had moments where I can appreciate nature or relax with my cat, but the symptoms are always in the back of my mind.

This entire experience has been overwhelming, and I feel like I’m constantly chasing answers. Every new symptom makes me wonder if something bigger is going on. I’m sharing my story in the hope that someone can help me understand what’s happening and guide me toward recovery.",1,1736885521.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
