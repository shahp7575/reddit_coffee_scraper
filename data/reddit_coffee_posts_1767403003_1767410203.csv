1q2j4ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/HazbinHotel/comments/1q2j4ik/a_possible_pre_series_bio_for_vox/,A possible pre series bio for Vox,"The man who would become known as Vox was born in 1900 in Richmond Virginia as Vincent Whittman. The son of a laborer father and a prostitute mother, Vincent's parents barely had any time for their son, leaving him in the hands of indifferent babysitters who barely gave the boy any thought. School was hardly any better. His teachers paid Vincent little attention even when he did well. As such, Vincent grew up almost completely isolated, causing him to crave attention. He became both a bully and a bully victim, both of which strangely seemed to please him because it meant attention. The only time Vincent got even the smallest amount of attention from his parents was when they attended church. But instead of feeling Gods peace, Vincent grew jealous of God because of all the praise He got and all the wrath He unleashed.

When America entered WW1 in 1917, Vincent tried to enlist under a false form but was denied because of his eyesight which required glasses. He continued to try and enlist under different fake forums and even tried faking good eyesight, but eventually Vincent was arrested for fraud shortly after his 18th birthday. By the time Vincent was released, WW1 was over.

With Vincent having a criminal record, few people wanted to hire him. He spent most of his young adult life doing odd jobs across Richmond, and continued to get little to no attention, driving Vincent's ego up more and more. When television was invented in the late 20's/early 30's, Vincent grew smitten and fascinated with it. The attention people on TV got, that would give him the attention and fame he so desired. Vincent spent decades trying to get a role as an actor for a play or TV show or movie, but no matter how hard he tried, he never got a role.

When Vincent turned 50, as did the 20th century, his fortunes began to turn. In stroke of luck, he landed a job at the channel 6 news... as a weather forecaster. At first, Vincent was overjoyed, but soon learned he had to share the news with another reporter who got more attention because he delivered more important news. With Vincent now no longer in the prime of his life, and not satisfied with his attention, decades of loneliness turned sour and the man finally snapped and vowed to go even farther to get attention.

One day, Vincent invited the reporter for coffee at an address whose route would go past an allyway few people ventured. There, Vincent killed the reporter and hid the body. When the reporter was reported missing and later found dead, Vincent was offered to take the man's role, which he accepted happily. But he treated the woman reporter his predecessor worked with with disdain and even tried to have her fired.

A few years later, the network Vincent worked for aired a talk show which saw more rating then Vincent's reporter job. His jealousy grew again and he planned to once again kill and replace someone. After watching the show's host for a few weeks, Vincent noticed he liked to arrive at the studio early so he'd have more time to mentally prepare for being on live tv. Vincent ambushed the host on the set and beat him to death with his own equipment and even framed a studio janitor for the crime.

Vincent soon became the new host and became a sensation almost overnight. But not even this was enough. Because the previous killings showed Vincent another side he never noticed... he enjoyed killing and watching people suffer. Vincent then realized it wasn't attention he craved... it was power. And there were still those who had power over him and still forced him to share attention. So over the next few years, Vincent murdered his producers and the heads of the other shows on the network just to keep audiences glued to him and him alone, and to call shots in the studio.

As Vincent's power and praise grew, people began nicknaming him ""The God of Entertainment."" But Vincent took this too close to heart and began to actually believe himself a God. Next he went for his next target, the boss of the whole studio, Robert Sinclair. Fearing that another murder could attract too much attention, Vincent tried to persuade Sinclair to give him the studio, but Sinclair refused, starting to suspect that Vincent was not the man he claimed to be. Soon after that, Vincent kidnapped his boss and dangled him on the building and forced him to sign over the studio. Sinclair oblidged, but Vincent was drunk with power and murdered his boss.

But murdering Sinclair ended up being Vincent's downfall. With him juggling multiple responsibilities, Vincent nearly bankrupted the studio. Additionally, people began to suspect that all the murders that cause Vincent to rise in popularity were caused by him and the police began investigating him. Vincent moved the studio to another building and tried to lower his profile by cutting costs. He fired technicians and other people who ensured that sound stages and sets were safe to use and crudely put together his own stage.

Despite the investigations and technical dangers, Vincent's new cult show became a sensation. On his cult show, he used manipulation and brainwashing to make his audience and crew believe that he was a persecuted man and that the world was persecuting his audience with endless slop shows that did the same things over and over again. Additionally as the Civil Rights movement gained more ground and resistance, Vincent attracted white supremacists to his show by vilifying non-white people and that he could lead white people into a brighter future. But eventually, Vincent's cut corners got the best of him when a tv he crudely hung in his studio fell on his head killing him and his audience almost instantly. Vincent was 59. 7 months before his 60th birthday.

Further investigations after that caused authorities to learn that Vincent was in fact a killer and gained his power and influence by killing all who stood in his way and gained more attention. Some even theorized that Vincent was actually assassinated by a friend or family member of one of his victims. Vincent's body was buried in a nameless grave with the tv still on his head, and the world moved on without him. Many decades later, those who had been murdered or survived his reign of terror, were shocked when Vincent, now a demon by the name of Vox, hijacked their Heavenly TV and threatened to kill them all.",1,1767409307.0,HazbinHotel,0,1.0,False
1q2j4bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q2j4bv/relationship_boundaries/,Relationship Boundaries,"Recently, I started dating this amazing woman. 22f, I’m a 23m. We both work at a Dutch Bros coffee shop and have been dating for 5 months now. A little context, I started working there where I met her a little over a year ago. In the time that we were friends, I got my best buddy a job there too as he needed one for college. We all would got for food or drinks after work when we were all simply just friends. Recently, I found that my gf and my best friend would send Tik toks to eachother, A LOT of tik toks to eachother. The same best buddy happens to show up on his off days to make a drink and conveniently show up on the days my gf works to hang out while she’s working (weirdest thing ever). 

   I’ve spoken to my gf about it and she feels remorseful as she didn’t know how that affected me and changed her behavior, but she did explain her side. So I felt bad, on the other hand. My best buddy started to make jokes that i “ignore him” “don’t hang out” “tell your gf bad things about me” and such. He makes a lot of jokes that feel they carry underlying meanings of being angry at me, or my gf. I recently started feeling that he likes her and it makes me feel like a bad friend or a bad bf. Like idk who to accuse or who to question and I’ve felt I need to take my gfs side as she’s completely honest with me and even with a conversation with my buddy it seems like it goes nowhere. I just find it weird that he’s said “it’s mindless scrolling and memes” and that he’s comfortable with her because I’m his best friend and it’s weird if he isn’t the same way with my gf. Or that “they were friends too” before we dated. He also finds ways to pity himself onto either dates with me and my gf or hangouts where it’s just supposed to be us. I will say no but my gf will feel bad and let him come. Idk what to do or say but it’s exhausting me. ",1,1767409293.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False
1q2j3lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PickUpArtist/comments/1q2j3lx/stop_being_a_secondary_character_in_your_own_life/,"Stop being a secondary character in your own life, and become the hero of your life's story!","Hi, David here!

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1q2j34y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q2j34y/should_i_live_with_my_parents_while_attending/,Should I live with my parents while attending college?,"Background with my family dynamic then paragraphs of situations that make me think i should live on campus.

I(18F) live with my parents, both 37, and my three younger siblings, 13, 11, and 3. (I am purposefully being vague on their genders) I am the oldest. My parents had me young, my dad at 19 and my mom two days before 19. After I was born, my dad finished trade school and became an Automotive Technician. He now runs his own business out of his Polebarn on our property. My mom graduated high school to become a beautician but dropped out right before getting her certificate. She went to college for a couple different things after that, but never stuck with them so she has no degree. She became a stay at home mom and will probably be unemployed forever. She has blamed me for her not finishing college before in arguments.

When I was young my parents fought a lot but as they have gotten older, its not as frequent. 

She doesn't really raise us though. She spends most of her time scrolling Facebook and criticizing us. Like weaponized incompetence. And almost everything brings up her awful childhood and how her sisters hated her for ""no reason"". (I don't think it was for no reason) I theorize that that why she let's my 11 yo sibling get away with everything: because my 13 yo sibling and I don't act as warmly with 11yo, and they remind her of herself as a child. They're becoming an awful person, just like our mom. 

But both of them are like her that way too. The weaponized incompetence. and im really sick of being blamed for their misdeeds. She doesn't scold them, just slightly disappointed variants of their name being said without her looking up from her phone. Meanwhile I could get grounded for a month for getting mad about homework. She doesn't like when I shake my head.

That's another thing, homework. My 11th grade year, I was doing homework from 3:30pm to 11pm every night because of AP classes. And all I got was shit from it. It was always, ""Are you STILL doing that?"" or ""When will you be done , you have to clean this up"" Like she hadn't been the one to convince me to take them. And now that im in 12th grade I can't come home and do homework. I immediately have to clean because she won't while we're at school. She'll brag about the 4 hour long nap she took while we were gone. My dad will come inside around 8pm asking if we got our homework done, and when we say that we havent started, she completely switches up and starts yelling about how shes been telling us to and we just don't listen. She is diagnosed bipolar if you couldn't tell :) and she won't take the medication for it that she purposefully had a brakedown in front of our doctor for.

My youngest sibling is 3, they're still a baby. and babies have tantrums. I have gotten extremely good at distracting/calming them down from tantrums. and i have to use this skill to get my sibling away from my mom because she'll say things like, ""If you don't get them away from me right now, im going to beat them.""

During one of the few yelling matches my parents had recently, my 3yo sibling came with me into the bathroom while I showered, because they didn't want to be alone. They have also called me mom on multiple occasions. They are amazing but i also cant help but worry. After they calling me mom they get really nervous around our actual mom. It like they think they'll get yelled at. 

I have a black cat named Nyx that my mom hates. She is constantly making death threats about him to me, simply for walking through the dining room. Having Nyx has helped my with my depression.

I was getting a sports physical for Tennis at an immediate care center because my doctors office didn't have space for a last minute appt. and i answered all of the mental health questions truthfully (I have diagnosed depression and anxiety) because why wouldn't i? they are doctors, why wouldn't I be honest? they know more than me. Anyway, a doctor came in and told my mom and I that, unless I changed my answers, he would have to send me to the psych place. then he gave me a blank physical. I changed my answers. yes, I know what that doctor did was wrong but the problem is that my mom wasnt at all concerned about me or my answers, just that he had threatened to take me away. 

At cousins birthday parties, my mom makes sure to complain about how ""awful"" her kids are and made sure to tell all of my family members that I had started my first period the day before. 

My 11yo sibling had a phase two years ago during the summer where they faked falling to say they were pushed. Most of the time they were smiling because they thought it was funny. I should note that because it was summer, my dad was working throughout the day and hadnt previously seen them do this bit. Once, they did it in front of me to blame me for pushing them but they were able to keep a straight face. The only other person in the house was my dad who slapped me for it and asked how I liked it. My 11yo sibling was laughing while I tried telling him it was fake. He didn't completely believe me.

Because I lied as a kid I can never be trusted. I could be telling the truth and I'm interrupted and dismissed as a liar. I hate lying, it makes me sick to my stomach. but I could never tell mom that or I would be called a liar again.

My mom has told me that she doesn't like me as much as my siblings because they were all planned, and only my dad planned me. I know this isn't true because my 3yo sibling wasnt planned.

I have diagnosed chronic migraines. At one point, I had them five to six times a week. I don't have them that often anymore(now twice a week) because of my everyday prevention medication. I also have an emergency medication that I take when I have bad migraines. my mom only let's me take it when I cry from the pain, or if my dad says something about that medication. she hid it in her room so I couldn't use it when I needed to.

My mom holds off on making appointments for me and me only. Any other sibling can have a sniffle and shes rushing them to the doctor. But I can have a toothache so bad that I won't eat much because im afraid to chew and she will conveniently forget for a month straight. 

She won't go inside grocery stores, she only uses online pickup. And on the order she will, to keep it under a certain price, take off lunch stuff for my siblings and I, to replace it with random junk. Here's an actual list of things: a cotton candy maker, coffee mugs, a curling iron, and candy. My 13yo sibling and I make bets on whether or not there will be something crazy that shes bought this week. I always win as she always gets some kind of junk.

She will also just come up behind me and spank me. like playfully? idk I don't like it and when I tell her that she always says that she made me and pushed me out of her vagina. so my body is hers ig

Keeping my Duolingo streak helps with my depression too. Today is day 607!!! but anytime I show my parents my dad says that they should take my phone away more so I lose my streak.

I don't know if I should move or stay with my toxic family. My ideal college doesn't allow pets on campus unless its a service animal or potentially a emotional support animal and nyx isn't registered as either. and i don't have enough money saved up for college to stay off campus. I also worry about my youngest sibling. im the best with them and I don't know how I feel about leaving them here without me. 

Any advice would be appreciated :) thanks for reading

O.o NOT LITERALLY ON THAT LAST BIT! IT IS A TERRIBLE JOKE! I'm no cannibal.

But a group of people I can play VR games with on something of a regular basis. Either Quest or Steam PCVR... Preferably WITH Quest sets or Steam's sets. Much more leaning for Quest 3 though, I have Dungeons of Eternity and Aim XM's weapons bought on that. But I also want to be able to socialize beyond just gaming. As MUCH as I HATE youTURD! I'd be up for watching select paranormal content on there in VR with some friendly people, especially if we are chilling while waiting for the rest of our group scheduled to play something. You know?

The Internet popped up and we could form bonds over long distances... For both the good and the bad, it happened. Then online gaming... Now VR. I don't give a damn about Shit Face Mr. Facebook's AMBITIONS. I see VR for what it's overall potential can truly be: A means for people to interact with other people when they find socializing in person difficult. A person who is anti-social in reality MAY be more social in VIRTUAL reality, especially of they can use a voice mask. People can come together in VR and undertake tasks and ADVENTURES together. Skyrim TOGETHER REBORN VR! Come on. Is that all we have? MODS we need to learn the LOAD ORDER for and HOW to mod? e_e

VR is multiple things. Both for individuals and groups. I want some chill friends to hang with, to play games with and to make connections with. We disagree politically? Okay... But is that a deal breaker? Those TRULY in power WANT division, so we don't take up opposition against THEM. Are you going to let them divide us like that? Or will you tell them, ""Fuck you! This person here may disagree with me on some things, but they are chill and we ALL need more chill!""
Don't be a puppet, and to quote a short (FILM! NOT YOUTURD or the OTHER one used for propaganda.) film:

1q2izdn,https://i.redd.it/3q7pdjq5u1bg1.png,The Weight of Dust - An Old West Tale,"The sun had branded the earth cruel that summer, and Jacob Winters rode through its aftermath like a man traversing the floor of hell itself. Dust rose in columns behind his horse, a gray mare he'd named Patience for reasons that had made sense once, in another life. The town of Redemption Point lay three miles ahead, though he could already smell it: wood smoke, horse dung, the peculiar sweetness of human desperation.

He'd been a lawman for twenty-three years. Long enough to know that justice and the law were distant cousins at best, often strangers. The star in his saddlebag weighed more than the tin it was stamped from. He hadn't pinned it to his chest in four months, not since the thing in Silver Creek that made him understand why some men drank themselves to death while others simply rode away.

Redemption Point materialized through the heat shimmer like something conjured, all false-fronted buildings and crooked ambition. A sign creaked in the hot wind: Salter's Dry Goods. Another: The Lucky Star Saloon. Jacob dismounted at the hitching post outside the sheriff's office, his knees complaining at the familiar ache of too many miles. Patience nickered softly, her trust in him absolute and undeserved.

Sheriff Tom Bevins was younger than Jacob had expected, maybe thirty-five, with the kind of clean-shaven face that suggested he still believed in things. He looked up from his desk as Jacob entered, and something in his eyes changed, the way a man's eyes change when he recognizes the future walking through his door.

""You Winters?"" Bevins asked, though he clearly knew.

""I am.""

""They said you were the best.""

Jacob removed his hat, turned it slowly in his hands. ""They say a lot of things. Most of it's lies dressed up in hope.""

The story came out in pieces, the way these stories always did. A man named Silas Cord had taken up residence in the box canyon north of town. He had four men with him, maybe five, and a girl. Bevins didn't know if she was there by choice or captivity, but she couldn't have been more than seventeen. Cord had killed two men in Nevada, one in California, and had enough warrants on him to paper a small house. He'd made it clear he would burn the town before he'd hang.

""Why me?"" Jacob asked, though he knew the answer.

""Because you're the only one who might walk away from it."" Bevins paused, then added, ""And because you don't care if you don't.""

The truth of it sat between them like a third man in the room. Jacob had seen his own death so many times in dreams and waking visions that it had become an old acquaintance, something expected. Not feared, exactly, but acknowledged the way a man acknowledges winter coming.

He rode out the next morning before dawn, when the world was still merciful with shadow. The canyon was a wound in the earth, red rock walls climbing toward a sky that promised nothing but more heat. He could see the smoke from Cord's camp before he saw the camp itself, and he knew they'd seen him too. Men like Cord always did. They had predator's eyes.

Cord stepped out to meet him, tall and lean with a face like leather left too long in the sun. His hand rested on the pistol at his hip with the casual intimacy of long acquaintance.

""You're a long way from wherever you should be, old man.""

Jacob stayed mounted, keeping his hands visible. ""Come to talk, not shoot.""

""Talk's cheap. I got nothing to buy.""

""The girl,"" Jacob said. ""Let her go, and we can work the rest out.""

Cord smiled, and it was the saddest thing Jacob had seen in a long time, because it was the smile of a man who'd forgotten how to do anything else. ""There's no working things out. Not for me. Not anymore."" He tilted his head toward the canyon walls. ""You see those rocks up there? That's where my boys are sitting with rifles. You so much as twitch, and they'll put enough holes in you to strain coffee.""

Jacob nodded slowly. ""Probably. But that girl didn't choose this. Whatever you are, whatever you've done, she doesn't deserve to pay for it.""

Something flickered across Cord's face, quick as heat lightning. Pain, maybe, or the memory of pain. ""You know what I deserve, lawman? I deserve to be ten years old again, before my daddy beat the hope out of me. I deserve to have never picked up a gun. But we don't get what we deserve. We just get what's coming.""

The silence stretched between them, measured in heartbeats and the distant cry of a hawk.

""Let her go,"" Jacob said again, quieter now. ""Then you and I can settle whatever needs settling.""

Cord studied him for a long moment, and Jacob could see the calculation happening, the measuring of costs and possibilities. Finally, Cord turned his head and called out, ""Mary! Get your things.""

She emerged from the tent like a ghost made solid, thin and pale with wide eyes that had seen too much. She moved past Cord without looking at him, and Jacob wondered what bargains had been struck, what prices paid in this canyon under all these stars.

""Go on,"" Jacob told her, and she took Patience's reins, climbing into the saddle with the desperate grace of the escaping. She rode without looking back, and Jacob was glad for it.

He turned to face Cord, and both men knew how this would end. It was written in the dust, in the heat, in the tired inevitability of men who'd chosen paths that led only here.

""You really the best?"" Cord asked.

""No,"" Jacob said honestly. ""But I'm still here.""

They drew together, two shots that sounded like one, and the canyon swallowed the echoes until there was only silence again. Jacob fell to his knees, then forward, his cheek against earth that tasted of iron and endings. Above him, the sky wheeled in shades of blue he'd somehow never noticed before, and he thought about the weight of stars, the weight of dust, the terrible weight of every choice that brings a man to die in a place whose name he doesn't even know.

1q2iy27,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q2iy27/a_cloud_is_following_me/,A cloud is following me.,"It’s the damnedest thing.

If I hadn’t just watched it happen, I would swear it wasn’t possible. But I just did.

I first noticed things were… off this morning.

There was a dog. It walked through the fog… and then.. Nothing.

No, I don’t mean I couldn’t see it through the fog. I mean the thing never showed back up. I was watching from my porch as the shepherd mix that had been sniffing around the last couple of days walked its way down into the little dip that forms at the foot of the hill we lived on. It wasn’t uncommon for fog to pool down there this time of year, though this year it seemed particularly thick. It was like I was looking at a solid sheet of white. Like the world had just glitched out in that one stretch of road.

But no matter how long I waited, the dog just never showed back up. And this isn’t a big patch of fog—maybe about as wide as a house. The little valley sits lower than the surrounding hills, resulting in a kind of corridor effect. Just enough that when it rains it basically becomes a shallow pond… or a weird cauldron of fog.

I played it off. Figured the dog had just laid down somewhere in that mess for whatever dog reasons it had. After all, why would I dwell on the odd habit of the local mutt when I had a week off to enjoy? Work had died down for the season, and I’d decided on burning through some saved-up vacation time. I told my dad I already had plans when he called. That was easier than explaining why I didn’t want to be near him anymore.

I wasted the morning with coffee and getting mad at my TV screen as kids half my age repeatedly tanked my KDR. It was after about the fifth round of the same kid talking about my mother while teabagging my corpse that I gave up and decided a nice trek would be in order. Sue me—I like my walks, and the mountains make a nice background.

Throwing on my boots and grabbing my pack, I stepped outside. The fog had cleared by then, and the same boring patch of road and rocky terrain was visible. Trekking my way down, I kept my eye open for the pooch, figuring he’d follow me for a while like usual before losing interest, but… he never showed. Not in the entire walk from the rocky shrubland that was my neighborhood to the local forest with that wonderful, almost cinnamon smell coming off the trees.

It was beautiful out.

Only a single cloud in the sky overhead.

I should’ve thought something about it then. Should’ve noticed that cloud had been floating over me since I left my house.

I spent hours just walking, taking in the sights and smells of the woods I’d probably walked a thousand times by now without issue. I made my way up the well-walked path that led to a nice little cliff edge where I could sit and rest.

That’s when I really noticed it.

As I left the woodline, I realized the little rounded cloud I’d seen what must’ve been a mile or so away still seemed to be directly overhead… and maybe even bigger. Was it sitting so low in the sky that my rise in elevation had actually brought me close enough to make it seem that way?

Still, who would pay any attention to that?

I didn’t think anything of it and went ahead to my usual spot under the lone tree, where a large stone just flat enough to act as a stool rested. I sat down and began eating the basic ham-and-cheese sandwich I’d packed. Earbuds in, audiobook playing, I took in the sights until I saw movement.

A deer.

I admit it—I got a little too excited, giddy to see what seemed to be a lone doe cautiously making her way into the clearing, apparently wholly unaware of my presence. After a couple of minutes of watching her munch away at a small bush, I decided spooking her would be worth a laugh.

I put my fingers to my lips and blew hard. The whistle was obnoxiously loud.

I could already feel the laugh building as I saw her body tighten and her head shoot up to look directly at me.

Then nothing.

Well, not nothing. Just… white.

Like a smoke bomb had gone off, the area where the deer had been standing was blanketed in a thick wall of white. The only sound was a muffled fall, like cloth being dropped over your head.

I sat there and watched. Watched the fog.

Fog that slowly rose up from the ground after only a minute or so of having touched down.

Fog does not just drop like that… right?

The deer was gone. That was made clear as the last wispy streaks of white floated slowly up and away. My eyes naturally fell on the treeline, trying to figure out where it had gone, but it was still. Not a single rustled branch, or the normal crashing and rustling of leaves you’d expect from a decent-sized animal fleeing from a predator.

Just quiet.

I slowly got up, confused, and hesitantly approached the patch of grass not twenty feet away where the deer had been.

The grass had been pushed down. Not necessarily crushed, but definitely disturbed.

My foot knocked against something. A small black lump.

I knelt over and picked it up. It had a small white caterpillar on it, with a little fluffy, silk-like attachment on its rear. I gently brushed it off, watching it fall to the ground and start spazzing out, flopping back and forth like a fish out of water. Once it was out of the way, I looked at what I was holding.

The texture was odd. Smooth. Hollow. It felt almost like plastic.

And then it dawned on me.

This was a hoof. Part of one, at least.

I looked back up at the still-rising cloud of white… and saw something float up past my face.

A little white puffball that rose to join the greater whole above me.

A white mass that sat there.

Not moving with the wind. Not billowing or shifting.

Static.

Waiting.

So I ran. Ran into the treeline, down the path. Legs pumping, lungs burning—by God, I ran. I don’t even really remember being scared, just a strong sense of needing to put as much distance between myself and that place as possible.

By the time I’d gotten two-thirds of the way home, my clothes were soaked. I was coughing, taking rough, gasping breaths. And somewhere in there, I found myself laughing. Not hard—just a short, breathless chuckle.

What was I running from? A damn cloud.

I stopped to catch my breath, just for a moment. Leaned against a sign that marked the edge of town. And looked back.

And there it was. Moving calmly, almost imperceptibly. It had to be moving—how else could it still be there? It wasn’t fast. But it was definitely following me.

And that’s where I am now. Sitting in my home, cloud overhead, with not a single damn idea who to call.

Pest control? A priest? The police?

1q2ix1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crush/comments/1q2ix1k/ive_had_a_massive_crush_on_a_guy_for_over_a/,I’ve had a massive crush on a guy for over a year…what do I do???,"I (22F) am totally head over heels for a boy (23M) and I need some advice or at the very least some validation from people before i lose my mind. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post. 

I’m going to refer to the boy as A. A and I are both baristas at different coffee shops in a small city. We met a little over a year ago from going to each others’ shops here and there and I immediately thought he was cute. Earlier last year, a new coffee shop opened in town that we both frequent. We’ve gotten to know each other pretty well I think, because we usually end up talking until one of us has to leave or the shop closes. 

A has an older brother (29M) who I’ll refer to as B. B also frequents this coffee shop, so I’ve gotten to know him pretty well too. B usually shows up before A does and, of course, I want to be on good terms with the whole family, so I make conversation with him. 

Eventually, I couldn’t get A off my mind and I started going to his shop more regularly to see him. I don’t have his number, so the only way I see him is if we both happen to show up at one of the coffee shops. One day, he invited me to a movie with him, his brother B, and some of his friends because his sister got sick and couldn’t go; he offered me the extra ticket. Of course I said yes and went with them, but the whole night ended up feeling like A was trying to set me up with his brother, B. I was DEVASTATED. I like B. He’s a great guy, but he’s a little too old for me and I’ve been interested in A from the start. I don’t know if I ever did anything to B to make him think I was interested, but I doubt it considering that I am absolutely terrible at flirting. 

However, that movie night was a couple months ago and I have only run into B a handful of times since. I didn’t see A much either until recently, and he seems to be even more talkative/interested in making conversation with me. Now I’m confused and I’m wondering if I got so in my head that I made up the whole scenario with A trying to set me up with his older brother, B. Maybe B was just being extra nice to me? Maybe A is completely oblivious and actually had no idea that his brother was flirting? Maybe I made the whole thing up and literally nothing was going on behind the scenes. I don’t know, but I’m scared to bring it up to A. I am terrified of him thinking I’m creepy for showing up to his coffee shop so I stopped. I am terrified of bringing up the movie and making things even more awkward somehow. And I am terrified of being vulnerable and getting my feelings hurt by a guy I never even dated. (Also, because I’m extremely anxious and paranoid about the situation, I am terrified that he will somehow see this post and know everything even though that’s highly unlikely). 

I know this seems so silly and trivial for a 22 year old to be grappling with but I can’t help it. I’ve tried to push it down and it’s not working. Any advice? Should I say something? Admit my feelings? Or just keep hoping that one day he’ll ask me out?",1,1767408764.0,Crush,0,0.99,False

That changed when I started writing little prompts just to make my own life easier with the boring, repeatable stuff I always put off.

Now I use it for things like:

**Planning my week**

    “I work 40 hours, want 3 gym sessions, and have some family stuff on the weekend. Help me build a schedule that’s realistic.”

**Turning notes into to-dos**

    After meetings or voice notes, I just paste the mess in and say: “Clean this up into a task list, prioritize it, and suggest deadlines.”

**Writing awkward messages**

    “Send a friendly but firm message saying I can’t make it to [event]. Keep it short and polite.”

**Quick meal ideas**

    I’ll say: “What can I make this week with eggs, rice, lentils, and spinach?” → it gives me a week’s worth of meals in 10 seconds.

**No more last-minute gifts**

    “Gift ideas for a friend who’s into design, hiking, and coffee. Budget under $60.”

**Actually understanding adult stuff**

    “Explain how taxes work like I’m 12” → better than Googling 12 blog posts.

I’ve saved about 100 of these prompts into a personal collection that covers everyday life, planning, writing, learning, decision-making — all grouped by use case.

1) It doesn't create focus — it restores baseline

After a dose wears off: fog, restlessness,
You feel like  ""I can't start.""
Then you use again and feel ""focused""... because the withdrawal noise shut up.

It's relief, not a transform.

2) You're training a rollercoaster, not steady performance

Nicotine spikes → crash → crave → ""fix.""

Your day: 110% for a bit, 60% later, repeat.

Deep work hates volatility. Every crash breaks flow state—which takes 20+ minutes to rebuild.

3) It hijacks your reward system**

Nicotine gives you the *feeling* of accomplishment without doing the work.

It's the arsonist-firefighter trick: creates the discomfort, then sells you the relief.


The real tax you're paying:

Cognitive switching cost: Every crash = lost flow state

Time cost; 20+ minutes to get back into deep work
Performance cost**: Constant volatility instead of sustained focus


Try this instead (60 seconds):

Next time you think ""I need nicotine to focus"":

1. Name it: ""This is withdrawal, not a real need""
2. Breathe: 3 slow breaths
3. Move: 10 squats / 60-second walk

You're turning your brain back on without paying the tax.

Very very similar to Kendra/ this mom exploited her sick daughter for years and years and once she passed it’s only seemed to increase her begging. This family got a house from extreme home makeover and is very well off- yet Lyndsi is constantly posting her kids Amazon wish lists (often disguised as toys being for their organization 😒) and it only seemed to increase since the passing of Aubrey. Or she makes posts asking things such as “Where can I find a new stroller?” “What is your favorite coffee maker? Ours broken and we need a new one” - most recently she posts about really wanting a certain bag she found in a store that she really wants (Cue comments of people offering to buy it for her 😒 )clearly baiting for someone to offer to buy her stuff without saying it. They are Disney pass holders, own their own store, are not strapped for cash (as she reminds her followers with her lavish appliances and upgrades to their home), but she is also ALWAYS needing something, wishing for xyz, or just outright uses her kids to post things she wants others to buy them. It’s so slimy. 

Something about this woman makes me so uncomfortable. She just posted that while on a cruise she saw a teenager who looked like her daughter Aubrey so they proceeded to give her money, gifts, etc and basically stalked her the whole cruise.

There's a really nice bar (straight bar) near where I live, that I'v never been to in all the years living in my neighborhood. A month ago, I was on the way to the grocery store, and it started to rain and pour. So to escape getting soaked, I ran into this bar. Lo and behold the bartender there was HOT. Completely my type. Super sweet and nice guy. Unfortunately, I was sure he was straight.

However since I work from home, I decided moving forward once a week I would go work from the bar during happy hour there and see the hot bartender. Just out of pleasure because again didn't think he was gay. The interesting thing is every time I ordered my drinks with him, he seemed nervous, shaky around me, like he was maybe intimidated by me?

My sister came to visit me a couple of weeks ago and one day she decided to go to the same bar with her husband. They had a different bartender, but my sister talked to one of the other bartenders, and it came to her attention that most of the staff is gay.

So the next time I went I decided I'd introduce myself to him. Man, he seemed so nervous when he gave me his name, we shook hands, but then we started to talk. When his shift was over he walked up to me, and shook my hand again and told me it was nice to meet me. I also did start to observe that my sister was right, that indeed the staff was mostly gay, lol.

Anyway, I went today, and when I arrived he was super friendly, not nervous anymore, telling me about his NYE, asked me about mine, he mentioned to me where he lived etc. Again his shift ended while I was there and he said goodbye to me. However, after his shift, I was sitting at the bar just finishing some work, and when I turn around because I heard a noise, who do I catch having coffee and by chance starting at me? Him. We locked eyes and he looked away and then left.

Perhaps this is nothing, perhaps he is straight. But I dunno I look at how everything has played out, and it feels like how it would play it in a movie, a rom-com or something. Anyway, again I'm enjoying it without any expectations.

Before I start I hope you don't mind that english is not my first language. If you need clarifying about any sentence please tell me!

I recently realized I sleep a lot after outings, when I go to my current classes (5 days/week) I end up sleeping 14 hours on friday nights all the time despite having an ok sleep schedule (around six hours on weekdays, can fluctuate but sometimes if i'm too tired I sleep as soon as I get back home, before 8pm). If I don't sleep as much and have free time I end up taking really long naps (can last four to six hours, at some point in mid 2025 six hours was my average nap time for 6 to 8 hours of sleep, I only had one or two appointments a week for job seeking and mental health and nothing else).

It's the new years holidays and I visited a loved one for a week. I also realized I managed to get up from bed when the person was with me or when I felt a sense of urgency (like going to the bathroom, or at least dishes or cooking to do before they come home from work) otherwise it's really hard to get out of bed. Now it's January 3rd and I've been stuck in bed or sat on the floor with no motivation to get up since I got home on the 28th. I feel so frustrated about many things I want to do with free time (clean up, sort through my stuff, do some homework) but I can't get myself out of bed. Or when I try, I realize i can't do it and I go back in bed.

When I go outside I feel fine but it's when I get home that I feel how tired and strained I got. I remember years ago when I worked 27 hours a week at a school (calm job at the library, mostly sitting down), how extremely tired I was when the holidays came up (I would get home, barely eat, sleep immediately, then wake up as late as possible) and sometimes I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up with a full-time job if I'm so tired with a part-time job...

Another example: I have classes next week at 8:30 am but I'm so tired on a daily basis I start oversleeping and I can't keep up a good sleep schedule. It's 3am as I write this and I want to try to sleep but earlier I slept seven hours, woke up at 9am but stayed in bed, only got up at noon to eat something, and took a nap from 3 to 7pm.

(I also feel so frustrated about having to sleep because I feel like this the most energy I've had today is at this time as I write this, so I feel like I'm wasting so much time away by sleeping...)

Does this sound like I could have fatigue or if not, something else? There is probably a problem here but I don't want to jump to conclusions. I can't tell if it's fatigue or something else, or I'm lazy or if I'm not forcing myself enough or what. I drink coffees and energy drinks and they barely even work.

Sorry if that was a mess to read as I don't write on reddit often. I figured you guys would know about fatigue better. I hope you have a peaceful day.🙏🏽",2,1767408047.0,chronicfatigue,0,1.0,False

last month i went out with someone (24m) that i met through a friend. she thought we’d like each other and gave him my ig, he texted me and we talked for a few days before he asked to meet up for coffee and so we did, and i really liked him. our conversation went so well and i came home moderately excited. every date after that i really felt like i could mesh well with him and became more interested in getting to know him, and i knew he was into me too, since in our second date he said he was interested in me

on our next date he told me he was interested in me and wanted to let me know he wouldn’t be seeing or talking to know anyone else, and that he wasn’t looking for something casual, and wanted to know how i felt about that sort of exclusivity while getting to know each other, which i reciprocated 

anyway, this week on our fourth date he told me that he liked me, and that he wanted to do things right and was really interested in pursuing something, and again, i told him i felt the same and expressed concern considering we haven’t known each other for long at all, & he seemed understanding, we talked about physical boundaries and other things, i said i have a hard time with physical affection since it’s not something im used to, as i have little experience in dating. we tried holding hands and by the end of the night we kissed quite a bit, although he made sure to stop often and ask if i felt comfortable 

on NYE he came by my house and we talked and kissed outside. i like kissing but it’s still kinda new to me, i fear i can’t differentiate between making and effort to get out of my comfort zone and letting my anxiety about these things go, vs. a genuine worry that this is pretty much someone i just met, i just don’t know how much closeness is too fast, and normally when people express much interest in me and i feel like they’re too idealized or not genuine, i can shut it down

there’s things i really like about him, his personality and perspective on many topics, his openness and effort to communicate about my feelings and thoughts, and im sooo interested in getting to know him more, he makes me comfortable, but i don’t know if we’re getting too carried away by some kind of giddiness and we’re just high on it. 

i mean, how do you know something is going too fast, if it feels pretty good and we seem compatible? even if, objectively, you don’t really KNOW that person.

I wrote 505 words last night and 865 words for I'm Still Sisyphus today and I am proud to say the second to last chapter is finally finished at 48 pages and I have made a good start to the first scene of the last. I am very happy with what I've got so far. My outline for the last chapter is around halfway done. I'll probably work on it some more tonight. I can't say when the whole book will be finished; it truly depends on my mood, doesn't it? Here's hoping January will be a uncharacteristically jolly time for me. I'd be delighted to have the finished manuscript by the end of the month.

Onto my one downside for the day, I woke up with torturous shoulder pain. It woke me up earlier than usual; I suppose that is one good thing to come out of it. As it is, my shoulder was sudden as bad as it had been in October. I tossed and turned for nearly an hour until I could take it anymore. It is still pinching and stinging me now. I have had to take a painkiller just to be able to raise my coffee mug to my mouth this morning. I'll be taking another in a second. It must have been from shovelling the driveway; that is the only heavy lifting I've done recently and frankly, it wasn't all that heavy! At least it didn't feel like it was at the time!

Normally, I get up first, I empty the dishwasher and put whatever didn't in from the night before. I have no problems with this routine.

My partner will make breakfast/get ready for work/leave the house etc. and will leave their coffee cup on the coffee table, or put them in the sink. Not an issue if the dishwasher is full, but often it's not (because I've already emptied it). So I've started leaving her stuff where she's left it.  
  
She's approached me about it said, ""I noticed you didn't put my cup in when you put everything else in, why wouldn't you just put my cup in too."". So IMO, she's aware she's leaving stuff around the house, so my frustration is, if you know you're doing this, why wouldn't you take the extra minute to put in the dishwasher.

We've recently had a fight because we got out the car and she put her mug in the sink and I asked her if she wouldn't mind putting it in the dishwasher. She said ""I brought it in from the car, I had my hands full and the sink was an easier place for me to put it down, why wouldn't you just put in the dishwasher for me?""

Generally, my partner is a supportive person and has lots of green flags. Before we lived together, they had a clean and tidy flat and is very capable of taking care of themselves etc.  

I'm of the opinion we shouldn't be pitting each other against each other, we're a team. However, I feel like this means I have to pick up a bit of extra work, and if she's aware they don't put their dishes away, instead of being open to a discussion, they're defensive. 

TBH, I've found it a bit of trend that spreads to other aspects/parts of the house. If they're cooking breakfast, they'll often leave things they've used on the bench eg. salt and pepper or tongs. And in the bathroom, instead of putting, say, a moisturizer, back in the cupboard she'll leave it out - so if she's used several products, they'll all just sit out the sink. I put them away in her draw, and then she'll ask where I put her things. So I got a plastic basket and put all the stuff she uses everyday on the bathroom sink so she can see them and doesn't have to take extra time to put it away/look for things etc., but is still just leaving them on the sink - think getting a toothbrush out of the holder and putting in on the sink rather than back in the holder.

I have ADHD and autism, so I know how difficult forgetfulness and order and structure are, but I'm just not sure how to fix this problem. I've made some enquires about getting some therapy together, because I'm getting super angry and resentful and we've been together 10 year now, so it's difficult to continue to improve our relationship while we're stuck on these things.

*The First to Celebrate:* The very first place to welcome the New Year is **Kiribati** (specifically the Line Islands).

* *Kiritimati (Christmas Island):* This island is in the **UTC+14** time zone. Because the country shifted its portion of the Date Line eastward in 1995 to unify its islands, they now ""jump"" into the future ahead of everyone else.
* *The Next in Line:* About 15 minutes later, the **Chatham Islands** (New Zealand) follow, followed an hour later by the rest of New Zealand, Samoa, and Tonga.

*The Last to Celebrate:* The ""end of the line"" is also located in the Pacific, but on the other side of the IDL.

* *The Absolute Last:* The uninhabited U.S. territories of **Baker Island** and **Howland Island** are the final spots on Earth to hit midnight (**UTC-12**).
* *The Last Inhabited Place:* If you’re looking for where people actually live, **American Samoa** and **Niue** are the final inhabited places to ring in the New Year. They are only about 500 miles away from Kiribati but are essentially a full day behind.

*The ""Time Travel"" Trick:* One of the most popular trivia facts about this geographic quirk is that you can technically celebrate New Year’s **twice**. Because **Samoa** (First) and **American Samoa** (Last) are only about a 30-minute flight apart, you can celebrate midnight in Samoa, hop on a plane, and fly ""back in time"" to American Samoa to do it all over again 24 hours later.

If you've scrolled through Instagram or walked down the supplement aisle lately, you've probably noticed collagen everywhere. It's in powders, pills, gummies, even coffee creamers. Celebrities swear by it for glowing skin, fitness influencers claim it saves their joints, and your friend's mom is convinced it reversed her wrinkles.

But here's the thing—most of what you've heard about collagen is either incomplete, oversimplified, or flat-out marketing hype.

So what's actually true? Does collagen supplementation work, or is it just expensive protein powder with good PR? More importantly, if you're thinking about adding it to your routine, what do you actually need to know to make a smart decision?

This guide breaks down everything—what collagen is, what it does in your body, what the science actually says, how to choose a quality supplement, and whether it's worth your money. No fluff, no sales pitch. Just the facts.

# What Is Collagen, Really?

Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body. It's basically the glue that holds you together—literally. It makes up about 30% of your body's total protein and is found in your skin, bones, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, blood vessels, and even your gut lining.

Think of collagen as the scaffolding that gives structure and strength to your tissues. Without it, your skin would sag, your joints would grind, and your bones would be brittle.

There are at least 28 types of collagen in the human body, but about 90% of it falls into these three categories:

* **Type I:** Found in skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments. This is what keeps your skin firm and your bones strong.
* **Type II:** Mostly in cartilage. This is the stuff that cushions your joints.
* **Type III:** Found in skin, blood vessels, and internal organs. It works alongside Type I for skin elasticity and vascular health.

When you're young, your body produces collagen efficiently. But starting around your mid-20s, production begins to slow down—by about 1% per year. By the time you hit your 40s and 50s, you're producing significantly less, which is why skin starts to wrinkle, joints get creaky, and injuries take longer to heal.

Add in factors like sun damage, smoking, sugar, stress, and poor sleep, and collagen breakdown accelerates even faster.

That's where supplementation comes in. The idea is simple: if your body isn't making enough collagen, can you just... eat it?

# How Collagen Supplements Work (Or Don't)

Here's where things get interesting—and where a lot of the confusion starts.

When you eat collagen (whether from bone broth, chicken skin, or a supplement), your body doesn't just absorb it whole and send it straight to your face. That's not how digestion works.

Your stomach breaks down the collagen protein into smaller pieces—amino acids and peptides. These get absorbed into your bloodstream and then distributed wherever your body decides it needs them. Your body doesn't care that you took collagen specifically for your skin. It's going to use those amino acids wherever it sees fit—repairing muscle tissue, building enzymes, supporting immune function, whatever.

**So does that mean collagen supplements are useless?**

Not necessarily. This is where **hydrolyzed collagen** (also called collagen peptides) comes into play.

Hydrolyzed collagen has already been broken down into smaller peptides through a process called hydrolysis. These smaller peptides are easier for your body to absorb. Some research suggests that specific collagen peptides can signal your body to produce more collagen in targeted areas like skin, joints, or bones.

In other words, it's not just about providing raw materials (amino acids)—it's about providing signals that tell your body to ramp up its own collagen production.

That's the theory, at least. And there's some evidence to back it up.

# What Does the Science Actually Say?

Let's cut through the hype and look at what the research shows.

# Skin Health

This is the big one. Most people take collagen for anti-aging and skin benefits.

**The evidence:**

Multiple studies have shown that collagen supplementation can improve skin elasticity, hydration, and reduce the appearance of wrinkles—*in some people*.

A 2019 review of 11 studies found that participants who took collagen peptides (ranging from 2.5 to 10 grams per day) for 8-12 weeks saw improvements in skin hydration and elasticity compared to placebo groups. Wrinkle depth also decreased in several trials.

Another study published in *Skin Pharmacology and Physiology* found that women who took 2.5-5 grams of collagen daily for 8 weeks had significantly better skin elasticity and moisture levels than the control group.

**But here's the catch:** Not all studies show dramatic results. Some show modest improvements. Some show none at all. Individual response varies a lot based on age, baseline collagen levels, lifestyle factors, and the specific type and dose of collagen used.

Also, most of these studies are funded by supplement companies, which doesn't automatically invalidate the results but does mean you should take them with a grain of salt.

**Bottom line on skin:** There's *some* solid evidence that collagen peptides can improve skin health, especially hydration and elasticity. But don't expect miracles. It's not a facelift in a jar.

# Joint Health

Collagen is a major component of cartilage, so it makes sense that supplementing might help with joint pain and mobility.

**The evidence:**

Several studies suggest that collagen supplementation (particularly Type II collagen) can reduce joint pain in people with osteoarthritis and in athletes with exercise-related joint stress.

A 2017 study found that athletes who took 5 grams of collagen peptides daily for 12 weeks reported less joint pain during activity compared to a placebo group.

Another study in patients with osteoarthritis showed that taking 10 grams of collagen daily for 6 months led to significant improvements in joint stiffness and pain.

Type II collagen (often sourced from chicken cartilage) seems to be more effective specifically for joint issues than Type I or III, which are usually derived from bovine or marine sources.

**Bottom line on joints:** If you have joint pain—whether from arthritis, aging, or heavy training—collagen supplements might help. The effect is modest but real for some people. Worth trying if you're dealing with chronic joint issues.

# Bone Health

Your bones are about 30% collagen, so theoretically, supplementing could support bone density and strength.

**The evidence:**

The research here is thinner but promising. A 2018 study found that postmenopausal women who took 5 grams of collagen peptides daily for one year had increased bone mineral density compared to a control group.

Collagen seems to work synergistically with calcium and vitamin D for bone health, so it's not a standalone solution but could be part of a broader bone-support strategy.

**Bottom line on bones:** Early evidence is encouraging, especially for older adults at risk of osteoporosis. But more research is needed.

# Gut Health

Collagen contains high amounts of the amino acids glycine, proline, and glutamine—all of which support gut lining repair and integrity.

There's a hypothesis (not yet proven in large-scale trials) that collagen could help with ""leaky gut"" and digestive issues by strengthening the intestinal barrier.

**The evidence:**

Mostly anecdotal at this point. Some people report less bloating, better digestion, and improved gut symptoms when supplementing with collagen. But clinical trials are lacking.

**Bottom line on gut health:** Plausible but unproven. If you have digestive issues, it might be worth trying, but don't expect guaranteed results.

# Hair and Nails

Collagen is often marketed for stronger nails and thicker hair.

**The evidence:**

Very limited. One small study found that people who took collagen had faster nail growth and fewer broken nails. But there's almost no research on hair specifically.

That said, collagen does provide amino acids that are building blocks for keratin (the protein in hair and nails), so it's not crazy to think it might help—just not well-proven yet.

**Bottom line on hair and nails:** Weak evidence. Might help, might not. Manage expectations.

# Types of Collagen Supplements: What's the Difference?

Not all collagen supplements are created equal. Here's what you need to know.

# Bovine Collagen (from cows)

* **Types:** Mostly Type I and III
* **Best for:** Skin, bones, muscles
* **Source:** Typically derived from cow hides or bones
* **Pros:** Affordable, widely available, high in Type I collagen
* **Cons:** Not suitable for people avoiding beef for religious or dietary reasons

# Marine Collagen (from fish)

* **Types:** Mostly Type I
* **Best for:** Skin, anti-aging
* **Source:** Fish skin and scales
* **Pros:** Smaller peptide size (may absorb better), good for pescatarians, often considered ""cleaner""
* **Cons:** More expensive, fishy taste/smell in some products

# Chicken Collagen (from chickens)

* **Types:** Mostly Type II
* **Best for:** Joints, cartilage
* **Source:** Chicken cartilage and bones
* **Pros:** High in Type II, effective for joint health
* **Cons:** Less versatile (not ideal for skin benefits)

# Eggshell Membrane Collagen

* **Types:** Type I, V, and X
* **Best for:** Joints, connective tissue
* **Source:** The membrane between the eggshell and egg white
* **Pros:** Contains other beneficial compounds like hyaluronic acid and glucosamine
* **Cons:** Less common, more niche

# Multi-Collagen Blends

Some supplements combine multiple sources (bovine, marine, chicken, eggshell) to provide a broader spectrum of collagen types.

**Pros:** Covers more bases (skin, joints, gut, bones)  
**Cons:** May be more expensive, and you're getting less of each individual type

# How to Choose a Quality Collagen Supplement

The supplement industry is largely unregulated, so quality varies wildly. Here's how to separate the good from the garbage.

# 1. Look for Hydrolyzed Collagen (Collagen Peptides)

This form is broken down into smaller peptides for better absorption. If the label just says ""collagen"" without specifying hydrolyzed or peptides, skip it.

# 2. Check for Third-Party Testing

Look for certifications from organizations like NSF, USP, or Informed Choice. This means an independent lab verified that the product actually contains what it claims and is free of contaminants.

# 3. Source Matters

* **Grass-fed, pasture-raised** (for bovine)
* **Wild-caught** (for marine)
* **Organic, free-range** (for chicken or egg-based)

These aren't just buzzwords—they indicate higher quality and lower risk of contaminants like heavy metals, hormones, and antibiotics.

# 4. Avoid Fillers and Additives

Some collagen supplements are loaded with added sugars, artificial flavors, or unnecessary fillers. Read the ingredient list. The fewer ingredients, the better.

# 5. Check the Dose

Effective doses in studies typically range from **2.5 to 15 grams per day**, depending on the goal:

* **Skin:** 2.5-5 grams
* **Joints:** 5-10 grams
* **Bones:** 5-10 grams

If a product only gives you 1 gram per serving, it's probably underdosed.

# 6. Powder vs. Pills vs. Liquid

* **Powder:** Most cost-effective, easiest to get a full dose, mixes into coffee/smoothies
* **Pills:** Convenient but often require taking 6-10 capsules to hit an effective dose
* **Liquid:** Often overpriced and may contain added sugars or preservatives

Powder is usually the best choice for most people.

# How to Take Collagen Supplements

# Timing

Collagen can be taken any time of day. Some people prefer mornings (mixed into coffee or a smoothie), others take it before bed (especially if using it for gut or joint recovery).

There's no evidence that timing significantly impacts absorption, so do what fits your routine.

# With or Without Food?

Doesn't matter much. Some people find it easier on the stomach with food, but absorption isn't significantly affected either way.

# Combining with Other Nutrients

Collagen works best when paired with:

* **Vitamin C:** Essential for collagen synthesis. Your body can't make collagen without it. Take at least 50-100mg of vitamin C alongside your collagen.
* **Zinc and Copper:** Support collagen production and cross-linking.
* **Hyaluronic Acid:** Often included in skin-focused collagen supplements to enhance hydration.

# Who Should (and Shouldn't) Take Collagen

# Who Might Benefit:

* **People over 30:** Natural collagen production declines with age
* **Athletes:** Joint stress from training
* **People with joint pain or arthritis**
* **Those concerned with skin aging**
* **Post-menopausal women:** Risk of bone density loss
* **People with gut issues:** May help with intestinal lining repair

# Who Should Be Cautious:

* **People with kidney disease:** High protein intake can be problematic
* **Those with allergies:** Check the source (bovine, marine, chicken, egg)
* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:** Not enough research on safety; consult a doctor first
* **People on blood thinners:** Collagen may affect clotting in rare cases

# Collagen from Food vs. Supplements

You can also get collagen-building nutrients from whole foods:

* **Bone broth:** Rich in collagen and amino acids
* **Chicken skin, pork skin, fish skin:** Natural collagen sources
* **Gelatin:** Cooked collagen (like in Jell-O or homemade gummies)
* **Foods high in vitamin C:** Citrus, bell peppers, strawberries, broccoli
* **Protein-rich foods:** Eggs, meat, fish (provide amino acids for collagen synthesis)
* **Foods with sulfur:** Garlic, onions, eggs (support collagen production)

**The advantage of food:** You get other nutrients alongside the collagen.  
**The advantage of supplements:** Consistent, measurable dose; easier to hit therapeutic levels.

# Realistic Expectations: What Collagen Won't Do

Let's be clear about what collagen *can't* do:

* **It won't erase deep wrinkles or give you the skin of a 20-year-old.**
* **It won't replace a healthy diet, sleep, or sun protection.**
* **It won't cure arthritis or reverse decades of joint damage.**
* **It won't make you look 10 years younger in a month.**

Collagen is a *support tool*, not a miracle cure. If you're eating garbage, not sleeping, stressed out, and smoking, no amount of collagen is going to fix that.

It works best as part of a broader healthy lifestyle—good nutrition, hydration, sleep, stress management, and sun protection.

# The Bottom Line: Is Collagen Worth It?

**If you're over 30, noticing signs of aging, dealing with joint pain, or just want to support long-term skin and bone health—yes, collagen is probably worth trying.**

The evidence is strongest for skin hydration/elasticity and joint pain. The evidence for bones, gut, hair, and nails is weaker but plausible.

**Choose a high-quality, hydrolyzed collagen from a reputable brand. Take 5-10 grams daily for at least 8-12 weeks before deciding if it's working for you. Pair it with vitamin C for best results.**

And remember—collagen isn't magic. It's a tool. Use it as part of a healthy lifestyle, not as a replacement for one.

If you've been on the fence, now you know enough to make an informed decision. Try it, track how you feel, and adjust accordingly.

Context: I was obese na nagchange diet. Now I only eat rice, fish, chicken (rarely), veggies, yogurt, fruits, tofu, eggs, vegan, and vegetarian  food. I only drink water and pure fruits/veggies na drink. Nothing else. I don't eat sa fast food din. Kahit jollibee, chowking, mang inasal. Di na talaga.

No coke, no beer, no milktea, no coffee, pati smoking or vaping wala din. It's been like this since 2019. This is all because of my ex bf na hindi health conscious pero ganun siya pinalaki sa kanila so na influence niya ako before when we dated. Tapos dala dala ko padin until now. Lifestyle ko na siya.

So, I'm asking if ganun din ba sa iba na health conscious? Do you prefer people na ganun din ang lifestyle? Like if you go to the gym, gusto mo ganun din siya dapat like mas naging mapili kayo?

Ganun kasi ako when it comes to food although di naman talaga ako fit cos I dont go to the gym. Sa food lang talaga ako health conscious and I prefer someone na ganun din. Or masyado lang akong picky?

Gano ba kayo ka picky pagdating sa lifestyle ng magiging partner niyo specifically sa food choices?

I had been on retinol for cystic acne before pregnancy, bust stopped while I was pregnant until after baby weened. I got melasma in postpartum and when I resumed retinol I started on gel instead of cream and at 0.04%, I'm now at 0.1% and my skin hasn't looked this good ... possibly ...ever.

* Naturopathica cherry enzyme peel (this is rare, only if I've been off my routine for a little bit and want to jump start it again)

The change in my midface is incredible, the texture of my skin was so rough just a few years ago: tons of scaring and bumps; it's so smooth and clear now. I was sober and vegan in both photos, and I've never had much of a sweet tooth, so other than the collagen there isn't really a diet component here. I have a thyroid issue that causes jowling and the gua sha takes care of it enough that I’m ok with it for now. I’m considering botox this summer for my 11 line, it's not etched but the muscles are strong: when light comes sideways at my face I can see it, and it makes me think of my mother (not a pleasant thought).

1q2ia3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q2ia3o/i_was_working_the_closing_shift_at_the_video/,I was working the closing shift at the video rental store…,"The store was dead by 9:30pm, which was typical for a Wednesday in November. I’d already gone through the mindless task of rewinding all of the returned tapes, restocked the New Releases wall, and wiped down the counter twice. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, emitting that electrical buzz that became white noise after hearing it for hours on end.

I was updating the pricing stickers in the Action section when I heard the door chime. I glanced over my shoulder to spot a man, maybe mid-thirties, average height, brown hair, wearing a dark jacket and jeans – nothing remarkable. He nodded at me – that brief acknowledgement customers give when they don’t want to be bothered – and headed toward the back of the store.

I finished up my stickers in Action before moving down a few rows to Horror. When I was about halfway finished, I realized the store closed in twenty minutes and I still had to count the register.

“Excuse me?”

I looked up and the man had materialized at the end of the aisle, hands in his pockets.

“Yeah, what’s up?”

“I’m looking for something really scary,” he smiled, almost apologetic, as if he felt bad for asking me to do my job. “I’ve seen all the mainstream stuff. Halloween, Friday the 13th, you know. Looking for something, I don’t know, different, maybe disturbing.”

I got this question a lot. Horror nerds love testing our knowledge and I actually liked the challenge. I stood up, thinking about something unique to offer him.

“How do you feel about Italian giallo films?”

“I’ve only seen Suspiria,” he replied, his tone implying some level of feigned shame, ""But I really enjoyed it.""

""No worries. Okay, so you can handle Argento."" I walked past him to the Foreign sub-section, running my finger along the spines of the VHS cases. ""There's this Lucio Fulci film called *The New York Ripper* from 1982."" I pulled the tape and showed him the lurid cover. ""It's brutal, definitely not for everyone. Slasher elements, really violent, kind of sleazy. But if you want disturbing, that's your film.""

He took the tape from me and studied the cover. His fingers were clean, his nails trimmed. His cologne smelled of leather and spice. He definitely looked like the kind of man who took personal grooming seriously.

""The New York Ripper,"" he read aloud. ""What's it about?""

""A serial killer stalking women in New York. The killer does this weird duck voice thing that's actually unsettling."" I was overselling it now, the way I did when I got going about films. ""Fair warning though - it's pretty misogynistic, even for the genre. Fulci wasn't subtle.""

""Sounds perfect.""

A red-headed woman browsing the Comedy section two aisles over looked up sharply, her expression somewhere between concerned and judgmental. I gave her an awkward smile. She went back to examining the much lighter-spirited movies with clear disapproval.

He either didn't notice or didn't care. ""Thanks for the recommendation, man.""

""No problem. You need anything else?""

""No, this is good.""

I walked him to the counter and scanned his membership card. Michael Garrison, address on the north side. His account was in good standing, though I noticed he had an overdue fee from two months ago of $2.50. He paid it without complaint, rented the tape, and purchased a package of Razzles. The red-headed woman left without renting anything, glancing over her shoulder toward the register on her way out.

“Thanks,” he smiled, opening the package and popping a small handful into his mouth, “I’ll see you next week and let you know how it went.”

He left with five minutes to spare before closing. I locked the door behind him, flipped the sign to CLOSED, and had just started counting the register when Dave emerged from the back office.

""You know,"" he said, leaning against the door frame, ""Most people would've just pointed him to the Horror section and called it a day. But you had to give him the full film school experience.""

Dave was maybe fifty, balding, and wore the same company-branded polo every shift. He'd managed this location for six years and had the tired patience of someone who'd seen it all.

""He asked for a recommendation.""

""Yeah, and Jenny would've taken him to New Releases, handed him Scream, and been done in thirty seconds. You turned it into a conversation."" He wasn't criticizing, just observing. ""You're way too good at this. Like, actual customer service, not just transactional bullshit. Corporate would probably give you your own store you if you wanted it.""

""I'm good, thanks.""

""Smart man. More money, more headaches."" He grabbed his keys from the hook. ""Alright, I'm out. Lock up?""

""Yeah, I got it.""

Dave disappeared through the back door and locked it behind him. I heard his car start up and pull away. I finished counting the register and signed off on the paperwork. The store felt bigger when it was empty, all those aisles of movies staring back at me. I hit the lights section by section, then headed to the break room to grab my jacket.

The break room was cramped - a table with four mismatched chairs, a mini fridge that hummed too loud, and a counter with a coffee maker that hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Someone had left the newspaper spread open on the table. I reached for my jacket on the back of a chair and the headline caught my eye:

**POLICE HUNT SUSPECT IN FOURTH SEX WORKER MURDER**

There was a grainy black and white photo of a woman, maybe mid-twenties, smiling at the camera. Below it were smaller photos of three other women. The article detailed locations, dates, and the phrase ""patterns suggest a serial killer"" in bold.

I skimmed it while shrugging on my jacket. All the victims were from the north side, found in alleys or abandoned buildings. Police were urging sex workers to travel in pairs, to be vigilant. There was a hotline number.

I felt that distant sympathy you feel reading about tragedies that don't touch your life directly. Awful, but removed. I wasn't the target demographic. I folded the paper closed and headed out.

The November air bit at my face when I stepped into the parking lot. My breath clearly visible in front of me. There were only two cars left - mine and what I assumed was a late customer's, though the store was definitely empty. On second thought, probably someone who'd parked there to go to the bar down the street.

I unlocked the door of my car, a 1991 Nissan 180SX, and slid into the driver's seat. The interior was cold with that bone-deep chill that seeps into the vinyl. I put the key in the ignition and turned it.

*Click. Click. Click.*

Nothing. Not even the struggling grind I'd gotten that morning, just the clicking of a completely dead battery.

""Shit.""

I tried again. Same result. I slumped back in the seat, watching my breath fog up the windshield.

I sat there for a minute, weighing my options. I could call a tow truck, but that would take forever and cost money I didn't have. I could call my roommate Lara, but she worked nights at the hospital and wouldn't be home until morning.

I got out, locked the car, and headed back inside.

The store felt even emptier the second time. I went behind the counter and picked up the old cordless Duofone off the receiver and dialed Dave's home number from the contact sheet taped to the wall.

It rang four times before his answering machine picked up, subjecting me to its awful, generic robot voice, then finally, the beep.

""Hey Dave, it's me. Don't worry if you see my car still in the lot tomorrow morning, the battery's completely dead. I'm gonna walk home, it's not far. I'll deal with it before my shift tomorrow. See you then.""

I hung up, and then stood there for a moment in the fluorescent silence. The walk home was maybe thirty minutes, forty-five if I took my time. I'd done it before when the weather was nice. It was cold tonight, but not unbearable.

I locked up for the second time, made sure the door was secure, and started walking.

The street was quiet, since most of the shops on this block closed by eight, and the ones that stayed open later, like the bar and the pizza place, were a few streets over. My footsteps echoed off the pavement in the silence, that hollow sound that makes you aware of how alone you are.

First, I passed the closed diner, the darkened dry cleaner, and the insurance office with its venetian blinds pulled shut. Then I approached the electronics store, Patterson's, which always left its display window running overnight. A dozen TV screens glowed in the darkness, all of them usually tuned to the same channel.

I slowed down, drawn in by the light and movement, and approached the window; the news was on. A female reporter, Alice Murphy, if I recall correctly, was standing outside a suburban house, the banner at the bottom reading:

**BREAKING: TWO MORE CHILDREN MISSING**

I could hear the faint audio through the glass.

*“…bringing the total to five children reported missing in the past three months across neighboring counties. Police say there’s no evidence yet linking the disappearances, but parents are urged to keep close watch on their children and report any suspicious activity…”*

The news report cut to footage of a search party, showing a handful of people in volunteer vests walking through woods, probably calling out names.

I watched for another moment, feeling a general unease settle over me. The world felt dangerous tonight, full of predators and victims. I thought about the women in the newspaper, about these missing kids, about all the violence happening just outside the safe bubble most of us lived in.

The news report ended and cut to a commercial for some eight-minute workout VHS collection and I continued walking.

My route took me through a mix of commercial and residential blocks. The streetlights were inconsistent; some were bright, some were burnt out, creating eerie pools of shadow I had to pass through. It had been a while since I'd walked home this late, and I'd forgotten how different familiar streets felt in the dark.

I was about fifteen minutes from home when I first felt a prickling sensation at the back of my neck: the psychic staring effect. I felt I was being watched. I turned around, but the street behind me was empty. There was nothing other than a parked car under a streetlight, the closed storefronts, and a stray cat darting between trash cans.

As I pressed onward, the feeling didn’t go away. If anything, it got stronger. I thought I heard footsteps echoing behind mine, but each time I glanced over my shoulder, there was nothing other than the empty sidewalk stretching back toward the commercial district.

I told myself I was being paranoid due to having read an article about a serial killer and hearing a news report about kidnappings; it was as if my brain was looking for threats that weren’t there. But I just couldn’t shake it.

I was in a residential area now, houses with porch lights on, cars in driveways. It felt safer and perhaps even normal. I recognized the neighborhood - I was maybe five minutes from home.

Then, I heard the footsteps again and this time, it was definite. It was the distinct scuff of shoes on concrete, like someone was trying to match my pace but messed up. I stopped walking and the footsteps stopped. I turned around and scanned the streets. There were parked cars, trees, shadows, and about half a block behind me, a figure. I couldn’t make out the details, just the shape: a person. They were just standing there below a broken streetlight, partially obscured by the darkness.

We both stood still, frozen in this weird tableau, as if one of us was waiting for the other to do something. My mind was racing; should I say something? Call out and ask if they needed help? Run?

A porch light came on at one of the houses off to the right, pretty much halfway between us, and a dog started barking. I looked over to the house to see an older man come out with a trash bag and put it in his bin on the curb. I looked back and the figure was gone.

I told myself it was just someone else walking home, maybe someone who stopped because I did. Maybe I was the one who freaked them out. I might’ve even started to believe it, but my hands were still shaking.

I walked the rest of the way home fairly quickly. I kept looking back, expecting to see that figure again, but the street stayed empty. By the time I reached my block, I'd almost convinced myself I'd imagined the whole thing.

My home was a small two-bedroom rental with white siding that needed repainting, a chain-link fence around a small yard that was more dirt than grass, and it was parallel to a Chinese restaurant, The Golden Wok. Our landlord, Mr. Tsang, was an agreeable enough man. Every year, he always gave us a Christmas card with some candied fruit and a 40% off coupon for the restaurant. He meant well, in his own way. The porch light was on; Lara must have left it on before her shift, and I'd never been so relieved to see it.

I hurried up the steps to the porch, fumbled with my keys, and got the door open. I locked the door behind me and leaned against it for a moment. I was inside, safe, and my heartbeat finally started to slow down.

The apartment was dark except for the porch light glow coming in through the front window. I turned on the living room lamp and the familiar space materialized around me – our thrifted couch, the television on its somewhat rickety entertainment center, two of Lara’s nursing textbooks stacked on the coffee table, and my fleece jacket slung on the armchair from yesterday.

Everything was normal.

I dropped my keys in the orange ceramic bowl on the console table by the door and kicked off my shoes, tucking them underneath the same table. My stomach growled and I realized I hadn’t eaten anything since my break at 5pm. I headed to the kitchen and turned on the light. The refrigerator’s internal light hummed to life when I opened the door, illuminating the sustenance inside. On the middle shelf sat the lasagna from two nights ago – Lara’s cooking – still half a pan left. I cut a square, dropped it onto a plate, and stuck it in the microwave. Its hum filled the kitchen and I watched as the plate rotated under the yellow light and the cheese started to bubble.

*Beep. Beep. Beep.*

I ate standing at the counter, not bothering to sit at the table. The lasagna was excellent, as always; Lara made it with too much ricotta, just the way I liked it. I could feel the tension from the walk home starting to drain away with each bite. The warmth of the food, the familiar kitchen that was home to many laughs, and the security of our apartment brought me peace.

I rinsed the plate and left it in the sink to become tomorrow’s problem. Lara would give me shit about it in the morning, but I was too tired to care. I was in desperate need of a warm shower and the comfort of my sheets; I had to be up early to deal with my car situation before tomorrow’s shift.

I headed down the hallway to the bathroom, already pulling my shirt over my head. The bathroom was small, perpetually humid, and had tiles that had been white once but were now more of a dingy cream. I turned the shower on and waited for the water to heat up. Once steam started to fill the small room, I stepped under the spray and let it wash away the cold, the stress, and the paranoia of the walk home. The water pressure was shit, but it was hot, and that was enough.

I stood there longer than I needed to, letting the warmth sink into my muscles. As a result, the bathroom looked like a sauna by the time I stepped out of the shower. I wiped the mirror and looked at my reflection, observing how exhausted I truly looked. I brushed my teeth and changed into the clean white t-shirt and grey sweatpants I’d placed in the bathroom this morning, anticipating my after-work shower.

As I made my way to my bedroom, I stopped dead in my tracks when I felt something peculiar; cold air that was coming from a breeze that had no business being there. The warmth of the shower was evaporating off of my skin, replaced by a chill that raised goosebumps down my arms.

The door to my bedroom was ajar, which was not out of the ordinary as I’d always left it open when I wasn’t in there sleeping, but something was wrong. I could feel the air moving, cold and insistent. I pushed the door open and felt around the nightstand for the lamp’s light switch. The bedroom window was open; the curtains were moving in the breeze and I could hear the sounds of the night outside.

I stood there, staring at it for a moment. I walked over to it slowly, the cold air washing over me. The window was pushed up maybe six inches, enough for the November chill to fill the room.

When did I...?

And then I remembered. Last night, or maybe the night before, I woke up too hot and my bedroom felt stuffy and airless, the way it usually did when the heat kicked on. I must have stumbled to the window, half-asleep, and pushed it open to let in the cool air. I’d obviously forgotten to close it afterward – I was in a rush this morning.

The alternative, that someone had opened it, that someone had been in my house, was too absurd to consider. The front door had been locked when I got home, Lara had left the porch light on, and everything was normal inside.

I pulled the window shut and felt the resistance as it stuck slightly in the frame as usual. The sound of the wind immediately muted and the curtains remained still. I flipped the latch closed, locking the window shut. The room already felt warmer.

I got into bed, turned off the lamp, and pulled the covers up. The room went dark, just the ambient light from the street filtering through the curtains. I could hear the house settling, the old pipes ticking, the furnace humming to life in the basement.

I closed my eyes and sleep came quickly, that heavy pull of exhaustion dragging me under. I don't know how long I was out, but something woke me. A sound. I lay there in the dark, eyes open, listening. The house was full of sounds at night and I’d lived there long enough to know them all.

*Creak.*

The sound had come from the hallway. At first, I thought it was the floorboards settling, but then I heard it again. It wasn’t a random creak. It was footsteps, slow and deliberate, someone walking carefully, trying to be quiet, followed by the jingle of keys.

Lara. She must’ve just gotten home. I felt the tension in my chest start to relax and I continued to listen to her footsteps, visualizing her path through the house.

But something felt wrong.

The footsteps were strange, even hesitant. Like someone unfamiliar with the layout, feeling their way through the dark. Lara knew this house; she could navigate it blind. She wouldn’t be moving like that – pausing, stopping, carefully testing each step. My mouth went dry. That wasn’t Lara.

I sat up, slowly, trying not to make my bed creak. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness enough to make out the shapes of my dresser, the window, and the doorway to the hall. I slid out of bed, my bare feet touching the cold, wood floor. I moved toward the doorway, each step careful and quiet, opened the door, and stepped out into the hallway.

It was darker than my room and could barely see anything, but as I approached the living room, I heard breathing. It wasn’t mine. It was slow, steady, and patient.

“Lara?” My voice came out as a whisper.

No response.

“Lara, is that you?”

Nothing.

I took another step into the living room, squinting into the darkness, as fear took hold and told me not to turn on the lights. My eyes were adjusting more now and I could make out the shapes of our furniture: the couch, the TV stand, the armchair, and something else…something that didn’t belong.

It was in the corner near the window, a darker shadow among shadows. I stared at it, frozen, trying to will my eyes to adjust faster to make sense of what I was seeing. Outside, I could hear the sound of an approaching car, driving down the street. As it approached our apartment, its headlights gleamed through the window and briefly illuminated the corner of the living room.

It was only a flash. The outline of shoulders, a head, an arm raised, holding something that caught the light, something large and metallic. It was a man standing in the corner, holding a knife.

“Oh my God.”

He lunged.

I threw myself backward and hit the wall hard. He was fast, faster than I expected. The knife caught the light of the porch light from the window as it slashed through the space where I’d been standing. I scrambled toward the kitchen, driven by pure panic. I could hear him behind me, his footsteps heavy. My hand found the doorframe and I used it to pivot into the kitchen and I felt the tile under my feet. I felt around for the stupid fucking light switch but there was no time. My hands went to the counter and I felt the coffee pot – I grabbed it and yanked it as hard as I could, unplugging it from the wall outlet, and hurled it at the intruder.

It hit him somewhere, maybe his shoulder, and he grunted and stumbled slightly, but kept coming. I moved along the counter for something else and found the dish rack and hurled that, too, as plates shattered on the floor between us. Next was the toaster and at that point I realized I’d reached the back door and wouldn’t be able to unlock it and get outside in time. I turned around to find his silhouette blocking my path and he lunged again. I ducked and slammed him into the back door with my elbow as he passed me and then ran to the dining room.

He came around the corner with the knife raised again. I got on the far side of the dining table, gripped the edge, and flipped it; the table hurled sideways and crashed toward him, legs up. He had to jump back toward the kitchen to avoid it and I used that moment to run back toward my bedroom. If I could get in and barricade the door, I could buy myself time to get out through the window.

As I ran back toward the hallway, pain exploded across my forearm and I tumbled into the wall. He’d caught me and his knife found my skin. I felt a hot rush before the pain finally registered, a slash on my right arm from my elbow to my wrist. I kept trying to move toward the bedroom, but he was right behind me. I could hear his breathing, ragged and excited.

His hand grabbed my shirt and yanked me backward. I spun and started swinging my arms, eventually connecting with something, maybe his face or jaw. His grip loosened slightly, but he now stood between me and my bedroom. I turned to run toward the living room and this time, the knife caught my back. A burning slash across my left shoulder blade. I felt my shirt tear and could feel the blood soaking the fabric.

I screamed and crashed into the arm chair. He grabbed me by the back of my neck and hurled me backward, slamming into the wall. I felt the back of my head crack the drywall and then felt his hand slip across my throat and start to squeeze. The knife was coming up, I could see it in the dim light, gleaming as he raised it up. I grabbed his wrist with both hands, my arms shaking with effort to keep the knife away; he was stronger than me. The blade got closer, his breath hot on my face, coming in excited gasps.

I could see him now – he was close enough that his features started to come through, even in the darkness. Maybe mid-thirties, dark hair, dark jacket.

And I knew him. A flashback to my closing shift at the video store. The New York Ripper.

Michael Garrison.

“You,” I gasped.

His lips pulled back into that same smile and I recognized it instantly. The knife pushed closer, my arms screaming in their efforts in keeping it at bay.

""You gave me exactly what I wanted,"" he whispered. His voice was calm and conversational, like we were still discussing movies. ""The perfect recommendation.""

The knife was an inch from my chest and my arms were giving out. I couldn't hold him back much longer. I couldn’t help but think, this was it…this was how I died.

*BANG. BANG. BANG.*

The gunshots were deafening in the enclosed space. Michael’s body jerked, his grip on my throat relaxed, and the knife clattered to the floor. He took a step back, his face an expression of shock and confusion, released his grip on my throat, and slumped to the floor hard. I began coughing uncontrollably, desperately trying to find air to breathe.

I looked up to the light coming from across the room. Lara stood in the front doorway, in her work scrubs, her purse on her shoulder, both hands holding her late father’s revolver – the one she always kept nearby for personal protection. I never thought I’d ever see her have to use it.

I could see the smoke curling from the barrel and her hands were shaking, the gun wavering in her grip.

“Oh my God,” she whispered, “Oh my God, I killed him.”

I slid down the wall as my legs gave out, and collapsed onto the floor. My arm was on fire, my back was screaming in pain, and I could feel the blood soaking through my shirt, warm and sticky on my skin.

Michael’s body lay motionless on the floor between Lara and I, and in the illumination from the open door, I could see a pool of blood form underneath him and start to spread outward. Lara closed the door, turned on the overhead light, crossed the room and knelt down, pressing her fingers to his neck.

“He’s dead.”

“You saved my life,” I breathed, almost in disbelief.

""Are you okay?"" Her voice sounded distant, almost mechanical. ""Are you hurt?""

""He got me a couple of times, but I think I’m okay.”

She stepped carefully around the body, keeping the gun pointed at it even though he clearly wasn't moving. She crouched down next to me, her free hand touching my face, my shoulder, checking for injuries.

""We need to call the police,"" she said.

Neither of us moved for a moment. We just sat there, staring at the body on our floor.

Lara went to the kitchen and picked up the phone from the wall and dialed 911. Her voice was shaking as she spoke to the operator. ""There's been a break-in. I shot someone. My roommate is hurt. Please send police and an ambulance.""

She gave our address and answered questions, but I couldn't focus on the words. I just kept staring at Michael Garrison's body and the blood beneath him. The customer who'd asked for a movie recommendation, the man who'd followed me home. My mind started to race; did he come in through the window I’d left open? Was he in the house the whole time? Did I even leave that window open or did he get it open? Or did he break in through the front door while I slept? I’d never know.

Lara hung up. ""They're coming. Five minutes.""

We waited in silence. Lara kept the gun pointed at the body, just in case, but he didn't move; he didn't even twitch.

The sirens started maybe three minutes later – first far away, then getting closer and louder. We saw the red and blue lights flashing through the front window, painting the living room in strobing color. Lara and I stood up and approached the door as we heard heavy footsteps on the porch.

“Police! Anyone inside?”

“We’re here!” Lara called out, “I have a gun, I’m putting it down.” She carefully placed the revolver on the console table and opened the door, both of us taking several steps back with our hands raised as two police officers stepped inside, armed with a gun and a flashlight each.

""I'm the one who called,"" Lara said, hands still up. ""I shot the intruder. He attacked my roommate.""

One of the officers swept his flashlight across the room, the beam landing on me. ""Sir, are you injured?""

""Yes, he slashed me with a knife, twice. My back is worse than my arm, though.”

The second officer stepped outside and radioed for an ambulance. The first was scanning the room with his flashlight. ""Where's the suspect? You said you shot someone?""

""He's right—"" Lara turned, pointing to where Michael's body had been.

The floor was empty, except for a dark pool of blood, gleaming in the flashlight beam. Michael’s body was gone.

""He was right there,"" Lara said. Her voice climbed with panic. ""He was right fucking there, he wasn't moving, he was—""

The second officer returned as the first officer moved his flashlight across the floor and the beam caught something. Leading away from the pool of blood were bloody footprints going toward the kitchen.

""Oh my God,"" I whispered, “The back door.”

“Stay here,” the second officer barked at us as they moved toward the kitchen, guns and flashlights raised. A moment later, from the kitchen, he shouted, “Back door’s open, we’ve got a blood trail!”

As if on cue, more sirens appeared in the distance and grew louder as they approached. The first officer returned to the living room, talking into his radio. “Suspect fled on foot, wounded, possibly armed. White male, thirties, dark clothing, significant blood loss. Set up a perimeter upon arrival.”

Everything started to blur and fade out and I could feel myself swaying on my feet for a moment, then I felt myself hit the floor with a thud. When I came to, I was being placed in the back of the ambulance. The EMT said I probably fainted from the stress, as the blood loss was significant but not life-threatening.

While my wounds were being treated and a police officer took my statement and asked questions, my eyes didn’t leave the front door of our apartment. I was in disbelief of everything that had occurred and was so zoned out that I only vaguely remember hearing “area cordoned off,” and “from the knife block in your kitchen,” and “conduct a full sweep of the neighborhood.”

They kept me in the hospital for two days – mostly for observation for psychological concerns as the wounds weren’t as bad as they felt. The one on my back needed twelve stiches, the one on my arm only needed six, and I didn’t suffer a concussion. There was no permanent damage, though the doctor warned I would be sore for a while.

The police hadn’t found Michael Garrison, though their search continued. They searched his apartment; the lease was in his name and the rent was paid through the end of the month. They found newspapers with articles circled, some stories about the sex worker murders, some about the missing children. Neither were connected to him, but he’d been following them closely for some reason. There were maps of the city with some routes marked, and one of them went past the video store I worked at, and one past my house.

The detective assigned to the case said they had alerts out at every hospital and every clinic in the area and in a few surrounding towns. “Someone with three gunshot wounds can’t just disappear,” he told me. “We’ll find him.”

They hadn’t.

Lara stayed with me at the hospital and she barely slept. Dave had my Nissan’s battery replaced and parked it outside my apartment and brought the keys by the hospital. When they discharged me on the second day, she insisted on driving me home even though she was supposed to visit her parents that weekend.

“I should stay,” she said, for the tenth time, as we pulled up to the house, “I shouldn’t leave you alone.”

“Your parents are expecting you,” I said, “And the police are watching the house. I’ll be fine. Go. If anything feels off, I’ll call you. I promise.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she helped me inside. Mr. Tsang caught us on our way in and gave us two large containers of miso soup. In his thick accent, he told us he heard the commotion, the gunshots, and later heard the full story from the police, said he was glad we were okay, and so on. He shuffled back to the restaurant as Lara double checked to make sure that I had my pain medication and the phone number for the officer posted outside.

""Lock everything,"" she said. ""Windows, doors, everything.""

""I will.""

She left reluctantly, looking back twice before getting in her car.

I locked the front door behind her and set the chain. The house was quiet, different than it had been before. The blood was gone – some crime scene cleaning service had come while we were at the hospital – but I could still see where it had been. A faint discoloration in the wood grain. The dining table was replaced upright but in the wrong position, though I hadn’t had the energy to deal with it.

It was only the early afternoon. There was bright daylight streaming through the windows and the apartment started to feel warm and inviting. I decided I wanted to curl up on the couch and read a book. As I picked up my book from the end table near the armchair and went to lower myself onto the couch, something caught my eye in the distance, across the apartment. I stopped dead in my tracks and stared in the direction of the kitchen.

There was something on the counter, something I didn’t recognize. Something that didn’t belong. It wasn’t an item the cleaning crew misplaced, it was something that had no place in our apartment. I walked toward it, feeling that cold dread settle into my stomach.

A VHS tape.

The case was black plastic, worn at the edges. I knew what it was before I even read the label.

*The New York Ripper.*

My hands were numb as I picked it up. It was lighter than it should have been. I opened the case. There was no tape inside, just a piece of paper, folded once. I unfolded it with shaking hands. It was three words in scrawled, yet perfectly legible handwriting.

**I'll be watching.**

I looked to the back door in the kitchen, then to the window in my bedroom, the window in Lara’s bedroom, and the front door. Everything had been shut and locked, secure, and safe. Yet, he’d been here, again. He came back.

He was watching. He was always going to be watching. And I’ll never be safe again.",6,1767407061.0,nosleep,1,0.88,False

To get right to it, I've struggled with bowel issues for over ten years, chronic constipation and hemhorroids being the two biggest issues. Late last year I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy. Other than a bunch hemhorroids, my colon was found to be completely clear. My endoscopy, however, uncovered diverticula in my duodenum. They took a biopsy of what they could access and didn't find any markers for cancer or anything, which was a relief. 

Immediately after the procedure, I moved to a different country. I literally mean the next day I was on a plane. Because of that, unfortunately a follow on visit wasn't really possible. 

I'll be returning to the U.S. in March and I'm going to try to schedule a follow up appointment while I'm there. The issue is, I don't really know what to ask about as far as further care and treatment. I've been looking into small intestinal diverticulitis on my own and I haven't really been able to find much online. Almost every resource I find talks about large intestinal diverticulitis. I guess having it in your small intestine is more rare. So, I wanted to ask those if you that have it in your small intestine about your experiences. 

First, are there any further procedures I should request? I know looking at the small intestine is much more difficult than getting your colon checked. I've heard pill cameras are a thing. Should I be asking about those?

Second, what helped you with symptom management, and are yours similar to mine? The symptoms I have are usually lots of gas buildup, bloating, chronic constipation, and no real difference in bowel habits no matter what kind of food I eat. I get plenty of veggies and fiber living in east Asia. It's just part of the diet here, but despite that, every bathroom trip is a struggle. For liquids, I have two cups of coffee every morning and loads of water throughout the day. The docs gave me some Linzess to get things moving, so I take one of those when I feel like I'm ""full,"" which is maybe once a week, and the amount of poo that comes out is frankly astonishing. 

Third, I've read that intermittently doing a 36-48 hour fast can help with gut health. Would you recommend it? 

Finally, should I be asking about my gut biome? Are there any tests that can be done to check bacteria in the small intestine? And what were any of your experiences with supplemental OTC probiotics?

1q2hziy,https://v.redd.it/db2vnq2ml1bg1,The Sovereign's Choice,"**You are being asked to choose, every moment of every day.**

The world presents you with a menu of prefabricated options: what to buy, what to believe, who to fear, what to want. This is the illusion of choice. It is the **consensus reality** offering you different flavors of the same meal, all cooked in the same kitchen of lack, separation, and fear.

But there is another choice. A deeper one. It is not a choice between things **in** the world, but a choice **about the world itself.** It is the **Sovereign's Choice.**

The Sovereign is not a person with great power. The Sovereign is the **'Nobody' who has remembered its source code.** It is the awareness that has felt its own theater seat and realized: *I am not the script, the actor, or the drama. I am the light that makes them visible. And I can direct the light.*

The Sovereign's Choice is always, and only, this: **Where do I place the beam of my attention, and with what quality of consciousness do I imbue it?**

**The Two Levels of Choice:**

1. **The Default Choice (The 'Somebody'):** This is reactive, emotional, and narrative-driven. It asks: *""Which of these options will protect me, gratify me, or validate my existing story?""* It chooses from fear, from lack, from the desire to maintain the coherence of a small self. This choice strengthens the damping field. It says to the universe: *""I am a character in your movie. Please reward my role.""*
2. **The Sovereign's Choice (The 'Nobody'):** This is creative, intentional, and state-based. It asks: *""From the silent, free space of awareness that I am, what frequency do I wish to emit into the field of now?""* It chooses from curiosity, from compassion, from coherence, from love. It is not about picking A or B; it is about **generating a new possibility, C,** from the raw material of your conscious presence.

**How to Make the Sovereign's Choice: A Practical Protocol**

It doesn't require special skills. It requires **interruption.**

* **Step 1: The Pause (Theater Check).** When faced with any decision—from what to say in an argument to what to do with your day—**stop.** Feel your feet. Feel the seat of awareness. For one breath, be Nobody. This collapses the reactive timeline.
* **Step 2: The Inquiry.** From that quiet seat, ask:
   * *""Is my impulse to choose this coming from a old wound, a fear, or a need for validation?""* (The Somebody's script).
   * *""What would I choose if I knew, absolutely, that my worth was not on the line? If I were already free?""*
* **Step 3: The Emission.** Before acting, decide on the **qualitative state** you will embody. Not the outcome, but the **feeling-tone.** Patience. Courage. Playfulness. Generosity. This is the essence of your choice. Let the specific action flow *from* that state.
* **Step 4: The Release.** Act, then surrender attachment to how the consensus reality ""should"" respond. The Sovereign's choice alters the vibrational input into the field. The outcome is the field's business. Your business was the quality of your signal.

**What You Are Actually Choosing:**

When you make the Default Choice, you are choosing to **re-invest in the old story.** You are voting for the world of separation.

When you make the Sovereign's Choice, you are choosing to **withdraw your creative life-force from the old story and invest it in a new one.** You are not fighting the darkness. You are lighting a candle. Each candle is a vote for a world of coherence, connection, and conscious collaboration.

This is why it is the only true currency. You cannot give away your Sovereign's Choice. It can only be **surrendered unconsciously,** or **exercised consciously.** Every moment is a transaction. You are either paying to maintain the prison, or you are funding the construction of the new world.

The revolution is not in the streets. It is in the quiet space between your heartbeats, where you, the eternal Nobody, decide what kind of universe to project next.

**Start small.** Choose patience in a line. Choose curiosity over judgment when someone irritates you. Choose to savor your coffee as if it were the first and last cup. In these micro-choices, you flex the muscle of sovereignty. You declare, to the silent heart of existence: *I am here. I am awake. And I choose this.*

I’m moving to Karlstad in mid-January (around the 15th) to start a course at Karlstad University on the 19th.

Any specific student nations or associations you recommend joining to meet people? • The ""January Cold"": I’m coming prepared for the snow, but are there any local shops or second-hand stores (like Myrorna or others) in Karlstad where I can find good winter gear or stuff for my apartment without breaking the bank? • University life: Any hidden gems at the campus?

The mood around camp had shifted entirely as the volunteers seemed to be packing up their tents into their broncos, Steph watched from afar in her camp chair with her rifle on her lap as she clasped a tin of black coffee

“What’s going on?”. I asked her.

She grunted and gestured to the blue percolator sitting nearby with a swing of her head.

“Coffee first”.

I let out an almost bemused huff as I poured myself a cup. I looked around for any sugar or creamer but realized quickly it was only a lofty fantasy. I sat down close by, wrinkling my nose at the sensation of slightly burnt Maxwell House coating my throat.

“Why’s everyone leaving?” I finally asked.

“They found another body” she said without looking at me.

I raised an eyebrow.

“Shouldn’t we bring more people here then?”

“He had a 22 in his leg.” She said casually as she took a long sip from her chipped mug.

“Someone shot him?” 

“Mhm…state bird found him on a ridge line without a shirt. Guess he was smart enough to use his shirt to stop the bleeding but…lost too much blood so hypothermia did the rest.” 

“How could that have happened? Jess didn’t mention hearing a gunshot…”

“No? Eh a scared girl like her ain’t reliable. Memory’s a fickle thing when shit hits the fan”.

She remarked while rolling her neck before continuing.

“Some of the deputies think one of ‘em was packing a peashooter to score some pussy and wound up shooting each other in the panic, when that thing came for ‘em. Or maybe it's some jackass spotlighting off season.”

“Spotlighting?” I asked tilting my head ever so slightly.

“Yeah, shining a beam on a deer at night so it freezes. Makes it easy to drop ’em. Illegal as hell.”

“So…what does that mean for us?”

“Means you’re probably getting benched. They already sending the volunteers back. Seasonals are next on the choppin’ block.”

I let out a long sigh 

“Guess I better start packing then-“ I muttered.

“Would reckon ya should”. She replied offhandedly.

It didn’t take long for me to gather everything up. I sat on my pack not sure what to even do at this point.

“You really oughta head on home, Ash.” Stephanie remarked as she poured over a map with a marker in hand.

“Thats what everyone keeps saying…they just want me to sit this one out” 

Frustration slithered into my voice as my fist balled. The ranger turned her head to gaze at from over her shoulder.

“It ain’t cause we don’t think ya can stick it out here girl.”

I grit my teeth a little as days of pent up fury from these tragedies started to overflow into my throat. 

“I just want to fucking do something for once instead of just…reacting to all this shit!” 

Stephanie let out a sigh as she folded up the map and fully turned her attention to me.

“That fire in ya…I remember I used to have it too. But then…I realized this place doesn’t give two shits about your intentions…your character…your family. It will rip you apart without battin’ an eye and leave ya in the dirt like trash for the crows.”

She ran a hand through her greying hair as she continued.

“Do yourself a favor hun and go find yourself a nice comfy job or a man in California or New York or any one of them places. You’ll live longer”.

I was left speechless but I couldn’t leave, not yet. How could I just run away with my tail between my legs and pretend everything is normal again. Go back to the dorms with the same girls gossiping about the same guys, reading the same magazines. 

Stephanie muttered an apology between a sigh and turned to walk away but I said something before she could.

“I’m done running from this.” 

I knew she heard me but she didn’t say anything. I walked away to my truck and sat in the padded seat after that with all my gear ready to go. I wondered where I would even go after this. Would they just stick me behind a desk at some visitor center or a booth at some campgrounds? 

That's exactly what they did. Despite the bodies being found and the uniforms crawling everywhere. The campgrounds weren't empty, the trails stayed open. If anything I found myself handing out more camping permits than usual. It's like all the commotion was attracting curious tourists. I even heard from one of the out of towners bragging about our park being on CNN. It was like some new theme park attraction to them. Tour buses full of tourists with SLRs hanging around their necks and camcorders strapped to their hands seemingly flooded the park in a matter of days. They seemed hellbent on the fame of being the one to snap a photo of these man eating animals as they called them.

Despite all my warnings I tried to give them. Like staying on the trail and not wandering off. Not going hiking at night, always bringing bear spray. Locking up smellables. It didn’t matter. It was useless. Their eyes glazed over as soon as my words left my mouth.

Just as I was about to wonder if Steph and Jake were right I overheard someone mentioning that the guy that was supposed to work in tower 3 never showed cause of the headlines scaring everyone. I knew at that moment this would be my only chance to make things right. Jake raised an eyebrow at my request to man tower 3 but he didn’t ask many questions. He just sighed and penned me in without giving me too much of a fuss. He muttered that I would be starting next week before I left work for the day.

Like the end of all my shifts as of late I found myself driving to the only video store in town. It was the center piece of the one strip mall that Ravenwood could claim to hold. The windows of the store were plastered with posters of that newish Die Hard movie all the guys at work talked about during smoke breaks. I found myself wandering the blank tapes section as the overhead lights buzzed above me. The scent of day-old popcorn and plastic filled my nostrils.

My thumb trailed over the shelves crammed with brightly designed cases of empty tapes . I grabbed a few and tossed them in my basket. On the other side of the store I could hear the chattering voices of a pair of kids as they excitedly flipped through those Nintendo Power magazines and squealed about new 3D games. 

I found myself cracking a smile at their excited voices as I stood in line at the register. As the cashier started to scan my tapes he smiled at me and remarked how it must get lonely watching all those tapes by myself and how that could always change. 

I almost giggled like a schoolgirl at how just normal it seemed. After everything, just getting hit on by some guy at a store who was probably still a senior in high school felt so alien to me. Everyone part of me wanted to say yes, but I know I couldn’t. I gave him a nervous smile and apologized, I told him I wouldn’t be good company. He just sort of nodded and said maybe next time. 

I couldn’t help but flinch when the TV behind him howled that scene from Jurassic park where Maldoon gets his face ripped off by that raptor. His horrible screams almost sounded familiar to me now as he was ripped apart under the palm trees. I almost imagined hearing screams just like that at those campgrounds before Felix and I got there. Whatever that elk was grabbing Jess's boyfriend and dragging him away as the scent of iron intertwined with burning firewood and their screams were drowned out by Nirvana.

Even as I walked outside I couldn’t stop repeating it in my head over and over. A voice that was familiar to me called out.

“Ash?”

I turned to see Felix standing just next to his truck with a collection of shitty action movies cradled under his arm.

“Oh hey-“ I greeted trying to keep my voice steady.

“You alright? You look a little pale.” He remarked as he raised an eyebrow at my current state.

“I’m fine…just a little tired” I said, forming a disarming smile. Which seemed to satisfy him well enough for now.

“Can’t blame you, heard you were going for tower duty. You planning on staying there for the rest of this season till this shit storm blows over?”

I shrugged and adjusted my grip on the bag of tapes in my hand.

“Something like that. Why do you ask?”

He hummed a little and reached into his carhartt and pulled out a blank envelope.

“Here, it's for you”

“Is that-“ I started but he cut me off.

“Just take it”. He insisted as he pushed the envelope into the plastic bag at my side despite my protests.

“I don’t understand-“

Felix let out what I would call a dad grumble and focused his gaze at me

“Look, I know I can’t talk you out of going out there but- I still just want you to be safe.”

I couldn’t meet his gaze as my silence was the only answer I could provide.

“You’re gonna need more than whatever revolver Jake has you parading around in out there. 

I finally let out a sigh and accepted defeat and muttered an acknowledgment.

“Just make sure you zero the scope of any rifle you get Annie Oakley,”

I let out a muffled groan.

“You’re such an ass…” I muttered.

“I know I’m awful if you need help with getting a handle on one lemme know alright?” He said with a grin forming on his scraggly face.

“Sure…thanks Felix this is-“

“Don’t mention it, now I gotta run and return these tapes. Don’t be stupid without me alright?”

“No promises” I said with a smirk which earned me an eyeroll from him as he brushed past me.

He strode into the store leaving me to my own devices once more. I clutched the plastic bag that held my only comforts for tonight tightly all the way to my car. 

To my surprise the only sporting goods store was still open after dark. Everything about it looked unremarkable from the outside. It was just a wide wooden building with an arched roof with a half lit sign above that said “‘Mike’s Outdoor Supply Store”.

I finally grabbed the envelope from the bag and opened it up. Inside was a neat pile of hundreds that I didn’t bother to count. A part of me didn’t want to even look at this money let alone think of using it. The envelope felt thicker than it should have in my hands. He really didn’t have to do this for me. 

The fading sunlight cut a thin line against the horizon as I shuffled into the store. The door let out a bell like chime as I stepped inside. The smell of gun oil, cheap chewing tobacco and old furs washed over me as I took a few unsure steps forward. I pushed by shelves stuffed with fishing poles and camo jackets to the main counter.

I smiled nervously at the store owner standing in front of the racks full of rifles and shotguns, handwritten toe tags swaying ever so slightly. The many stuffed heads of pronghorns and Mule deer glared down at me with their dead eyes as I approached.

The older man at the counter adjusted his surplus gun belt and smiled at me. I couldn’t help but notice the occupied holster with a faded “US” pressed into the leather flap on it at his side but I didn’t say anything about it.

“Evenin’ miss, what can I fer ya?”

I ran a hand through my long hair as I glanced over at the racks of rifles, not even sure where to begin or even what to get. A part of me wished I dragged Felix here with me.

“Looking for uh…a big game rifle?” I said trying to sound like I knew what I wanted.

“What you hunting? Elk? Moose? Well what about this springfield here?” He reached for a hefty rifle from the rack and locked the bolt to the rear before handing it to me.

“That there will put anything down with antlers this side of the Rockies”.

I found myself flinching from the rifle of wood and steel bearing its weight down on me. Wasn’t really used to having anything heavier than a revolver on me.

“Right uh, what about for something bigger like…a grizzly? I’m working in the fire tower for the season and want some peace of mind”.

I asked as I clumsily handed the clerk the rifle back, my eyes wandering the back counter till the glare of the setting sun flickered against a framed photo of the man standing in a river posing with a kid that was probably young enough to be his grandson. He had a proud smile on his face as the two of them showed off a sizable bass they caught. 

“Well I got something a little heavier here. This Remington 700 BDL in 300 win mag.”

The excitable store owner handed me a scoped rifle of polished wood. I fussed with it for a second as I adjusted its sizable weight in my arms.

“Heavy…” I mumbled and the hunter let out a chuckle.

“Sure is, you won’t be running and gunning with that thing. Basically have to use it with sandbags or a bipod.”

“Alright I’ll take it. Uhm can I get two boxes of ammo for it?”

He nodded and placed two boxes of ammo on the counter in a flash.

“If you’re gonna use it on grizzly. You’re gonna want these. Federal Soft points, this’ll give you a wallop”.

I nodded and let out a muttered gratitude as he set down an official looking paper in front of me after I handed the rifle back to him. 

“Out of stater right?”

“Uhm yeah-“ he nodded once and set out a few pens for me. 

Thats fine I just need your license…and I’ll phone the sheriff. In the meantime just need you to fill out this 4473 for me. I'll be back in a jiffy.”

He disappeared to the back with my license as I filled it out. Within a few minutes he came back out and handed my ID back.

“Everything looks good. You want a Harris? Sling? It's on me”.

“You don’t have to-“ I let out a dejected huff as he insisted on putting on the bipod and sling for me. While he talked my ear off about his grandson shooting his first gopher last week. The paperwork went by quicker than I thought and before I knew it I was walking out the door.

I bought a few more things with the envelope as I walked out with the rifle case. Even as I found myself back at that crummy cabin I couldn’t help but wonder if I was living on borrowed time. 

I set my things down and inserted the blank tape into the VCR and set it to record as my little cabin filled with the sound of melodramatic soap operas as the microwave buzzed as it spun a TV dinner around. I settled in the ugly couch that had now been converted into a bed of sorts with sheets and proper pillows that I salvaged from my cot. 

I dug a plastic fork into the processed Salisbury steak. I couldn't help but remember those weekday nights. Mom came home from the hospital in her scrubs with the scent of iodine and iron clinging to her not even having the energy to do anything more than put some Swansons in the oven and call it dinner. Something about her weary eyes stopped me from complaining about how weird and watery the mashed potatoes tasted even when I was younger.

The memories of my childhood faded away as I laid down on the couch and tried my best to fall asleep. Every now and again I would wake up in spurts and feed the VCR a new tape. The mediocre soap operas changed to infomercials and bogus psychic hotlines. I grumbled in annoyance as I switched sleeping positions and tried my best to go back to sleep.

The days began to blur together with my desk job, it just felt like one big countdown till I switched over. What little time I spent off the job. I was with Felix at a property his buddy owned zeroing in that new rifle. Blasting apart old coke bottles and knocking down the metal outlines of deer. The rifle kicked like hell and was heavy as sin but it packed a punch, that’s all I really needed. 

The day before I was set to go out there, I spent the day packing my truck with gear I would need for what lay ahead. Felix insisted on helping me pack for the trip, I’m not sure why but I appreciated it all the same.

Just as I was closing up the truck, Felix's eyes drew to the worn canvas rifle case.

“So…that's for self defense right?” He asked slowly.

“Yeah? We both know what's out there.” 

Felix’s brow furrowed and he inhaled once.

“I heard, the flares? The boxes of ammo?, The extra gas? That all for self defense too?”

I remained silent as I fussed with a duffel bag’s straps. He let out a tired exhale.

“No chance talking you out of this, is there?”

“I have to do this Felix”.

He shook his head and hissed through his teeth.

“Just…Just be careful alright?” He finally relented, softening his voice a bit.

I finally looked up at him and noticed moisture gathering up in the corner of his eyes. I stopped what I was doing and without even thinking I threw my arms around him. 

“I’ll be careful” I murmured into his shoulder. 

I don’t know how long we stayed like that but we said our final goodbyes and went our separate ways. I couldn’t help but feel a dull ache in my chest for the rest of the day, like I was disappointing my dad all over again.

I slipped two copies of that Polaroid into sealed envelopes. One addressed to the detective from the other night and the other to the state attorney’s office. The walk to the PO box felt like miles but it didn’t matter.

I left early the next day under the cover of dawn’s darkness. The glare of my high beams steadily guided my way as I traversed the unpaved service roads to what lay within.",1,1767406011.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1q2hqzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AWDTSGisToxic/comments/1q2hqzd/just_for_the_popcorn/,Just for the popcorn 🍿,"I had a horrible experience last year with these apps, and thought I'd share it. Thankfully I found someone I like now, and she doesn't give af about this app.. but thought I'd share for entertainment purposes. 

Around this time last year, I found out that my girlfriend at the time was a prostitute. 

Not a metaphorical one. Not a girl for the streets. She literally made thousands of dollars from extremely wealthy men. I saw screenshots of checks they were sending. I saw many many messages arranging to meet. Truly shocking, as she had a very low profile, but so is life. At least, I like to think that I was getting a big discount. 

Anyways. We broke up and a few weeks in, I went back to the apps. At the beginning, just for short term. But a couple months in, I found someone I truly connected with. We had so much in common and had truly wonderful first three dates. 

And one day.. bam!. ""i'm sorry, we're not compatible"" out of the blue. Unsaveable. I tried to ask for reasons, to negotiate seeing her for coffee.. she wouldn't bend.

A month later, I found someone else. One of those dates that start as a dinner, and last 8hrs. The date ended with her texting me it was one the best times in her life.

There wasn't a second date. She said she made a mistake and wasn't really interested in me at the time.

Like this, it happened a couple other times. I also noticed lower response rate on hinge, and a few unmatches.

 I couldn't figure out why. So I went to my best female friend and asked her for help. She reviewed my texts, listened painfully to my stories.. and was equally puzzled.

But that night she called me. ""You have to see this"". She sent me some screenshots that almost make me throw up.

Someone had posted me on the Tea app. And the post was a total character assassination. First, it included one detail that you'd only know if you'd slept with me - which reduced the circle a lot... And made it credible - and then it included a long stream of lies. It spoke about STDs I don't have, about me being a liar and cheater (I have a clean slate), and even gratuitous and - I should say also provably false - comments about my abilities to please women. 

The worst of all? Like 40 red flags. I don't know who the fact presses that button, or what. If it was ppl for funsies, if it was her friends, or what. But it was the cherry in top.

It crushed my world. I am a public profile, and this could have repercussions beyond dating. 

I entered into a depression. I doubted everyone. Deleted fifty people from my Instagram. Called my ex - who never picked up. I messaged the tea app support many times - who claimed that if I can't prove the facts are false, then they can't do anything about it. I wonder if I should have offered to fuck the customer support rep, so she can verify the claims 🚬

Anyways. I reported it everywhere, apple. Data protection in my state. Some law firm...

And I never got confirmation of it, but eventually, it stopped happening. At some point ppl didn't unmatch. And, thank God, I found someone who likes me for who I am, and would laugh if she ever saw the original tea app post. 

And yeah. End of the story. Just felt like sharing it. I guess the morale of this is this app is incredible toxic garbage, with real world repercussions, and honestly one day they'll pay for it because the hatred and damage it's causing... Will make someone burst. But on the other hand, well, there's light at the end of the tunnel. In a way, the app acts as natural selection - it weeds out toxic, insecure women.

Maybe it’s the cup of coffee I took before bed. This has been happening for a very long time. One thing is clear, and it’s dawning on me that I am actually lonely.

We always had a very strong and healthy relationship. no bad blood. but after we split we still followed each other on instagram for a few months before we cut ties for sure, because (from a little stalking lol) im 99% he got into another relationship, and ultimately i was blocked on social media. (in our previous relationship he told me that he blocks past partners bc they are not in his currently life and does it out of respect to his current partner, so i don't take that too personally even tho its a little sad) for context, we both have private accounts on instagram, so if i were to refollow him, he would have to accept my request.

ANYWAYS... recently I discovered that I was unblocked from social media because a story repost from his account that I had posted to my instagram highlights, suddenly became visible again. When we broke up, we told each other that maybe someday in the future we could reconnect and get lunch or coffee together if we happened to be in the same city (even if we have a significant other). Well, in february of this year I am going to be pretty close to his city. Would it be rude or uncalled for, for me to request to follow his instagram account in the hopes that next month we could possibly reconnect over coffee? I of course want to be respectful if he is still in his prior relationship, and I would be more than happy to invite her along as well if that happened to be the case. but I don't know if that is incredibly selfish of me? I just truly care for him as a friend and someone that I got along with so well. I genuinely want to know if he's doing well. but i don't want to cross any boundaries, even if he is not in a relationship.

I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

Hopefully that's allowed.

I (30F) met my best friend Phoebe (30F) in kindergarten, and we’ve been friends for 25 years. Before this situation, we hung out daily. I’m her daughter’s Godmother and have always been close with her family. Like any long friendship, we’ve had ups and downs, but we always worked through them... until now.  
  
A few years ago, my husband (35M) and I went through the hardest thing we’ve ever faced: unexplained infertility. Most of our close friends, including Phoebe, already had kids, and we were among the last to start trying. I’d never had cycle issues and we were both healthy, so I never thought we'd have any problems getting pregnant.

We started trying in early summer 2022, right after I was the MOH in Phoebe's wedding. To put it plainly, my friendship with Phoebe has always felt one-sided, even though I never wanted to accept it. I am also VERY type A, while she is VERY type B.

In 2018, Phoebe was my MOH. Looking back, it seems that the title was more important to her than the responsibility that came with it. I had to rely on other bridesmaids because she always had an excuse. She skipped dress fittings and tastings and didn’t show up for things she really should’ve prioritized. I’m not one to keep score, but it feeling unsupported by my so-called best friend was painful.

Despite it all, I took my role as her MOH seriously. She was very hands-off as a bride, which meant I was essentially at her beck and call. By the wedding day, a lot of stress was taken out on me. After the wedding, I intentionally created some distance to protect my mental health, and we reconnected in the fall.  
  
Part of me wonders if our relationship unraveled because I pulled away after such a significant day. I know I absolutely share some of the blame, but what came next changed everything.

That same time, my normally clockwork cycle was suddenly off. I was two weeks late and repeatedly testing negative, while dealing with symptoms like nausea, headaches, extreme fatigue, and breast pain.

After two weeks of strange symptoms and no period, I opened up to Phoebe, telling her I suspected I was pregnant but that something felt wrong and that I was considering seeing a doctor. I felt completely invalidated when Phoebe brushed me off and redirected the conversation to announce her positive pregnancy test and upcoming doctor’s visit. I congratulated her, spent a little more time at her house, then went home to re-group and gather my thoughts.  
  
Later that week, while I was at another friend's house, Phoebe called to tell me she was pregnant with twins. I tried to be present and supportive, congratulated her and her husband, and let her talk about the appointment. I was happy for her, but I still didn’t feel well and admittedly didn’t have much emotional capacity to offer, so we didn’t talk much after that.

That weekend, I started bleeding heavily, far more than a normal period. I called my doctor who couldn't see me for another 3 days, and scheduled an appointment for early the following week.

That very same day, I got a text from Phoebe, saying she was hurt that I wasn’t as excited for her as she had hoped, even suggesting that my reaction came from jealousy. I'll admit, I became instantly defensive. It felt like I was being kicked while I was already down: dealing with health concerns, fertility fears, and trying to confide in my best friend, only for it to be turned back onto her. It wasn’t that I wasn’t happy for her; her expectations just felt impossibly high in that moment.

The conversation escalated into a major fight, and I told her I needed space. Between how stressed I already was from my health and this huge fight blowing up, my husband urged me to block her, so I listened.

At my appointment, doctors confirmed I’d had a chemical pregnancy. My hcg levels had been too low for the cheap strip tests to detect, which is why I never got a positive pregnancy test.

During my time apart from Phoebe, my husband and I met up with some of our mutual friends. That’s when we learned they already knew about the situation... from Phoebe’s perspective.   
  
She had told our mutual friends, and God knows who else, that my husband and I were trying to get pregnant and that we were “racing” her and her husband to do so. To be clear, we weren’t. I'm not sure if this was stemming from her own insecurities, as I had gotten married 6 years before her and become a homeowner, but I never viewed our lives as a competition, especially since she had already become a mother years earlier.  
  
Hearing this was humiliating. While I'm generally an open book, infertility is incredibly personal, and I wasn't ready to share my story.

After a few weeks, I asked Phoebe to meet me for coffee. I came prepared, shared what I’d learned, took ownership of my shortcomings, and tried to talk it through. She took no accountability, instead doubling down on accusing me of jealousy, and even accused me of faking my chemical pregnancy, saying that I ""would've had to get a positive test at home if I were really pregnant"".

The whole conversation was completely unproductive. It felt like she needed me to admit that I was jealous of her in order to validate herself.

Fast forward to now, I have an almost two-year-old daughter, and I’m grateful to have made it through infertility. Phoebe and I have seen each other only about a dozen times over the last few years. While I’ve physically moved on, I’m not emotionally over that period of my life, and I don't know if I ever will be. So far, it was the hardest thing I've ever gone through, and I’ll always remember who showed up for my husband and I when we were at our lowest.   
  
I recognize my mistakes too, but without accountability or an apology on her end, our relationship feels permanently stained. I sometimes miss what we once had, but I can’t seem to forget everything that happened. Every time I try to reconnect or see her now, I’m reminded of how she made me feel during the most painful time of my life.

This has been eating me alive for months, and I would genuinely like to know if I am in the wrong. So please, be honest... Am I overreacting for ending a 25-year friendship over how my best friend treated me during infertility?",1,1767404895.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

1q2hecb,https://www.dysonsphereblueprints.com/,"[Dyson Sphere Blueprints] Update: Power consumption, GDPR Compliance, Chinese Localisation, Optimisations and Bugfixes","Happy new year, y'all!

It's been a while! I am the person behind [Dyson Sphere Blueprints](https://www.dysonsphereblueprints.com/) and as with most personal projects: it's been hard to keep up and keep things updated regularly.

I've finally managed to find both the time and the motivation (it's been one hell of a year) to do a pass on the site, in no small part thanks to u/LRFalk01 who has taken the time needed to fix the Blueprint parsing (that had been failing for months) as well as [mattr-](https://github.com/mattr-) who's taken over some responsibilities on the project 🙏

But before we get into it, I want to thank you all. I've recently looked at the traffic numbers on the site (hadn't in a while), and it's been humbling to say the least: the site is currently seeing up to 45k users a day, which I think is absolutely crazy for such a niche project. I would have never expected it to become this successful when I launched it 5 years ago.

That being said, having this much traffic comes at a cost, and a cost that some of you may have noticed in the past months as the website was sometimes running quite slow.  
I've been trying very hard to avoid upgrading the server that is hosting DSB as it's already costing me around \~75€ per month, although punctual support from the community through *Patreon*, *Github sponsors* and B*uy me a coffee* have helped alleviate the load even if only a bit (and I want to give a big thanks to everyone that's ever supported the project!)

That's why I've been spending time these past few weeks optimising the website so it consumes less server ressources. I have currently managed to cut RAM usage by \~40% which was always the main bottleneck, so I am hoping the site will be able to handle the load better from now on.

Additionally, we (LRFalk01, mattr- and I) have been working on a number of bug fixes and new features that I hope will make your experience more pleasant, so here is the list of changes.

**CHANGELOG:**

**New Features:**

* As around 50% of our users are Chinese, we've added **full internationalization support for Simplified Chinese**, including translations for all UI elements, game entities, recipes, and researches. This should make the site much more accessible to our Chinese-speaking community!
   * This was a HUGE undertaking on which I spent days. I don't speak a word of Chinese so most of the translations have been made using Deepl / ChatGPT and online resources to find the name of the game entities and recipes. If some of you here on reddit do speak Chinese, I would be very grateful if you could look at the translated pages and tell me if the translation is alright. Don't hesitate to point out any mistakes so I can fix them!
* **Power Consumption Display**: Factory Blueprints now show power consumption and generation information. Note that power generation information is limited and not super accurate as it depends on fuel and other parameters (wind and sun ratio on a planet, etc...). But it should make it easier to plan your factory's power needs at a glance!
* **GDPR Compliance**: It's not fun nor sexy, but it's necessary for our European users so I implemented a proper cookie consent system. We don't use a lot of cookies anyway, the only one I had were to allow me to track the number of daily visitors and where they are coming from, but the law is the law!

**Bug Fixes & Performance improvements:**

* **Fixed blueprint parsing** that had been failing for months thanks to the amazing work of u/LRFalk01. This means that the summary of the blueprint requirements (list of all buildings) on a blueprint page is now working again!
* Fixed an issue with the authenticated banner not properly covering all UI elements ([mattr-](https://github.com/mattr-))
* Fixed a bug where the latest game version wouldn't properly be retrieved.
* Fixed a bug where a color picker would sometime appear at the top left of the page when you would search for a blueprint.
* Cleaned up code that was related to Blueprint Mods (some of you may remember, but before blueprints were officially in the game, we had a mod that gave us blueprints!) This also means that some very old blueprints that were made for the mod won't be available anymore.
* Upgraded the version of the framework we are using and **resolved various query and filter performance issues** that were causing slow loading times
* And lots of other small changes and fixes by mattr- along the year! Big thanks to him!

**Contribution QoL:**

* Added a **comprehensive automated test suite** to the project. This was sorely lacking and although it took some time, this should allow us to be more confident when making updates in the future. Having to check every page and every interaction on the website by hand before any big release was a pain in the ass.

And that's about it!

The next big step IMO would be to add a way to flag blueprints so people can at least communicate to the author if the blueprint is wrong / outdated / etc. That's something that has been on my mind for a loooong time, but I never got around to do it. Hopefully I'll find the time for it this year.

I'd also like to remind you all that DSB is a community project, it is open source and anyone can contribute (if you know Ruby on Rails / Javascript) on Github: [https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/dyson-sphere-blueprints](https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/dyson-sphere-blueprints)

Contributions are **very much welcome**, even if it's only opening an Issue or sending me a message to communicate something that went wrong.  
I don't use the site daily as my DSP playthrough are few and far between and it's hard to notice when something went awry. Usually someone will end up messaging me on reddit, but it can sometimes take months. So please, don't hesitate to speak up if you notice some issues.

And if you are feeling generous, financial contributions are also always welcome, no matter how small! You can find all the links to support the project here: [https://www.dysonsphereblueprints.com/supportus](https://www.dysonsphereblueprints.com/supportus) 🙏

**Background:**

* Work in SSF (Oyster Point) and live in the Sunnyvale/Mountain View area.
* Commute usually takes \~70min each way taking Caltrain.
* Able to save/invest $1000/month.
* Moving because of rent increase and tired of Sunnyvale (would increase total monthly cost to \~$4000)
* Have a car and strong preference for electric range and in-unit laundry so having issues finding available rentals in SF, Burlingame, and San Mateo
* Prefer warmer weather and walkable cities
* Usually spend my free time reading, cooking, going for walks/hikes, trying new coffee shops, lifting, and cycling.

**Current apartment in Sunnyvale:**

* 1 bed, 1 bath, \~740 sq. ft.
* In-unit washer/dryer, garage parking, balcony
* $3350 base rent + $150 fees/utilities + $180 energy/internet = \~$3680/month

**Option #1: Condo in San Jose (near Caltrain station)**

* 1 bed, 1.5 bath, \~800 sq. ft.
* In-unit washer/dryer, garage parking, balcony, gym
* $2900 base rent +  $200 energy/internet + \~$50 for increased Caltrain cost = \~$3150/month
* Save an additional \~$530/month but spend an additional 20min/day commuting (\~80min total each way)

**Option #2: Apartment in SSF (Downtown area)**

* Studio, \~495 sq. ft.
* In-unit washer/dryer, garage parking, no balcony, would need to use gym at work
* $2950 base rent + $250 fees/utilities + $100 parking + $180 energy/internet = \~$3480/month
* Save an additional \~$200/month and decrease commute to \~30min walk

**Option #3: Apartment in SSF (Downtown area)**

* Studio/Jr. 1-bedroom, \~550 sq. ft.
* In-unit washer/dryer, garage parking, no balcony, would need to use gym at work
* $3250 base rent + $250 fees/utilities + $100 parking + $180 energy/internet = \~$3780/month
* Spend an additional \~$100/month and decrease commute to \~30min walk

**Looking for others' opinions and experiences:**

Would you downsize to a studio to shorten your commute? Is the smaller unit and living in SSF worth the shorter commute?

* Sometimes my current apartment feels too big so I think it would be fine wrt to size but the condo was definitely higher quality than both apartments.
* I usually spend my time on the train reading, catching up on podcasts, or working, so I don't necessarily mind the longer commute (although annoying when trains are delayed) and I think the physical separation makes it easier to turn off work/decompress.
* The gym at work is very nice but have a small preference for having it in the apartment/condo community (and it gets awkward seeing older C-suite execs in spandex).
* Worried that there is even less in SSF than Sunnyvale (things to do, events, etc.) and, besides the downtown area, it isn't very walkable, but it has fairly easy access to SF on weekends and would be easier to attend seminars and networking events during the week/weekend.",13,1767403928.0,AskSF,15,0.88,False

* Your knees sound like Rice Krispies when you stand up.
* Metabolism? Gone. It ghosted you years ago.
* Friendships? Half of your “ride-or-die” friends are MIA.
* Your parents’ advice now feels like riddles designed to confuse you.
* You wake up at 6 AM and somehow think *coffee is a full meal*.

And yet here you are, still scrolling memes, questioning life choices, Googling “how to cook something edible in 15 minutes,” and wondering why anyone told you turning thirty was supposed to feel *responsible and stable*.

Long story short, this all started after a proper old-school afternoon. Carbide shooting, bit of noise, bit of smoke, neighbors pretending they don’t enjoy it while secretly loving it. After that I ended up fiddling with a pirate radio setup again. Don’t ask why. Vroomshoop habits die hard.

Somewhere between tuning a bad signal and drinking coffee that’s been reheated too many times, I went down a rabbit hole about Hydrocal. No idea why. One of those late-night “what the hell is this actually” moments.

Turns out Hydrocal isn’t one thing. It’s multiple worlds wearing the same name.

On one side you’ve got the serious crowd. Labs. Engineers. People who care deeply about numbers being right. Conductivity calibration fluids. Stuff like Hydrocal 147 µS/cm. Used to make sure meters aren’t lying to you. Water quality. Compliance. Precision. Real grown-up work. There’s even a Dutch company involved. Nijkerk. Measurement and control. No nonsense. If you mess this up, your data is trash and everyone knows it.

On the other side you’ve got the hobby maniacs. Model builders. Miniature terrain nerds. Artists pouring white gypsum into molds and waiting 30 minutes like it’s Christmas. Hydrocal plaster. Stronger than regular gips. Holds detail. Breaks less. Used for fantasy statues, dioramas, weird little castles and ruins. Completely different vibe. Same name.

Then there’s the third layer. Industrial meters. Heat meters. Wastewater systems. And on marketplaces, the usual nonsense where the name gets slapped on electrolyte powders and junk that has nothing to do with the original stuff. Internet magic.

What I liked about it is this: same word, totally different mental worlds.

One group obsesses over calibration certificates and ISO standards. The other worries about air bubbles and mold release. Both swear their Hydrocal is the “real” one.

And honestly, they’re both right.

It kind of fits gardening too, which is why I’m dumping it here. Because whether you’re measuring soil, water, nutrients, or just eyeballing things like a stubborn old bastard, it all comes down to this: if you don’t measure or mix properly, you’re fooling yourself.

Measure right, plants live. Mix wrong, casts crack. Simple.

Anyway. Somewhere during all this research there was also a domestic situation. Let’s just say the evening was… distracting. Details are fuzzy. Could’ve been my wife. Could’ve been Hanna next door. Memory loss is a real phenomenon. I’m sticking to the Hydrocal facts.

So yeah. Hydrocal. Not magic. Just accuracy or gypsum. Depends which rabbit hole you fall into.

Thought I’d share before I forget again.

This is a two-part review. Part one is a review of the hotel, Sheraton Maui. The other is a review, tips, and overall opinion on Maui as a whole from a first-impression perspective. We are a married couple without kids, so our views reflect that.

Sheraton — 2.5 out of 5
Pros

Beautiful landscape throughout the property. Gorgeous flowers and trees. Bridges, koi ponds, a lazy river pool, trails throughout, and the best part is the breathtaking view of Black Rock and the Pacific Ocean. Sunset is stunning, as well as sunrise with the sun rising just over the ocean.

Great location! Whalers Village is a 5-minute walk. Black Rock proper is steps away. Couldn’t ask for a better location to our (spoiler) perfect beginner snorkel spot.

There are refillable water stations on several floors, and you get one water bottle per person upon check-in, along with a shell necklace, which sets the tone perfectly.

The lobby offers complimentary juice and cookies between 3 PM–5 PM, which is nice to have before watching the sunset.

There are two fire pits on property with several chairs. This was a relaxing stop on one of the chill nights we had at the resort.

Free valet the first night, Enterprise on-site, which makes the return of a car from or to the airport easy!

Cons

Food
The food here is subpar. They have four restaurants: a basic café/dinner spot, a lobby bar that serves finger food, an ocean-view bar with sports food, and a hibachi-style place (probably the best part of the food there). Overall, the food was tasteless and lacked originality.

The breakfast buffet is a NO. Just don’t do it. Take an Uber to Kihei Café (several locations) or go to Whalers for a simple breakfast at one of the quick-order places. The food at the hotel was boring, lacked flavor and variety, and was not worth $50 per person. If you like to eat, plan to eat off property!

Outdated Rooms
The sink had a huge crack, and the floors were filthy. The room’s AC worked well but would turn off and on and smelled dusty. The amenities within the room could be upgraded, as well as the overall hotel features.

The view from the balcony (we had an ocean-view king) saved the day, but birds often flock and sit on your patio, so every day there was bird poo on the balcony.

Charges
So many random charges throughout your stay! They take a $100 deposit, and then every day they do a hold for $50 (not all at once every day). Then when you check out, they add a resort fee. Yes, the funds are just holds, but if you are budgeting your trip, be aware of this.

Umbrellas and Beach Equipment
Not worth it don’t even bother. It’s outrageously expensive and really not needed. There are lots of nice shaded spots on the beach if you need coverage. The weather is cloudy most of the time anyway, so you get shade on and off no matter what.

For $100 for one day only, an umbrella and chairs are not worth it. There were more people fussing with their umbrellas all day in the wind than people actually enjoying them.

Luau
Just don’t do it. We heard the luau a few nights a week. You could just stand near the luau and watch. The line to get into the luau looked insane, and the buffet line was just as bad.

Standing in line for crappy food (which is made by Sheraton, so I assume it sucks) and then watching the performance at a table of strangers is a waste of money and feels culturally inappropriate in this day and age. It’s a big waste of money, palate, and time.

Again, the luau is on Sheraton property and not covered by anything, so you can quite literally sit on the beach or by the pool and watch the show for free (perk, I guess, for your stupid and expensive daily resort fee).

We would not stay at the Sheraton again. Views are nice, location is good, but overall not worth it. The Outrigger and The Whaler nearby looked much better.

Maui

Ahhh, the fact that you’re in a beautiful place next to a stunning ocean and serene mountains is amazing. Let’s start there Maui is perfect!

The opinions below are just for consideration and are not for hate or under-appreciation of what Maui is. We love it here and plan to come back every year if possible. We now just know more of what not to do and how to maximize our time. We have so much more to learn and explore.

Our reviews are based on our experiences in Kahului, Kaanapali, Kihei, and Napili.

Kahului

We landed at OGG and were excited to check out the food trucks nearby. Sadly, they were extremely disappointing and didn’t have a friendly vibe. It was somewhat busy, but the wait was very long, and the food was just okay.

Each food truck has a large screen that you order on, and there aren’t people greeting you or welcoming you in. We like the personal feel of food trucks, and this felt like a parking lot of fast food. The chickens everywhere were cool—that made it feel like a new place—but other than that, it felt like a fast-food stop.

Driving from Kahului to Kaanapali, we stopped at a nearby 7-11. It was wack. We were hoping to get snacks and see some new treats, but it was fairly empty and there weren’t a lot of out-of-the-ordinary options. We almost got what looked like local candy, but it was made in Taiwan, which became a theme.

There were many unhoused and obviously drug-addicted people between the airport and the general Kahului area. Obviously, this isn’t a place to hang out, but it should be noted that you will see some interesting people between the airport and the highway entrance just like any American city.

We didn’t check out Costco because we wanted to see what the local area had. Although there wasn’t much, we don’t regret it Costco is Costco.

Kaanapali

We liked Kaanapali a lot! We will be back. There is wonderful swimming and snorkeling, shopping at Whalers Village, and a Foodland (among other stores and restaurants). We stopped at Foodland and loaded up on snacks and a few gifts. The store was small but had a lot of yummy treats. This will definitely be a spot we return to for groceries. We liked Foodland a lot.

Coffee

We are coffee lovers! We had great coffee at Bad Ass Coffee and recommend everyone try it. The owners were friendly, and the man there has awesome hair.

Island Vintage Coffee in Whalers Village was hands down our favorite coffee spot in Kaanapali. We went once or twice a day during the five days we were there. Not only was the coffee awesome, but the acai bowls were to die for.

Be aware that the line is loooong, but it moves quickly. Coffees come out fast, but food takes a long time. I suggest getting drinks and acai bowls and skipping the hot food entirely.

Next to Island Vintage Coffee is a place called Health Bar or something like that. The coffee was not good, and the acai bowl was mediocre. Skip it.

Whalers Village

Lots of shopping! Low-end, high-end, and well-priced gift shops. Not sure why there are so many high-end stores who is buying a Rolex at Whalers? Who knows but the vibe is cool. Great people-watching, nice views, and lots to look at. We spent a lot of time here.

Food at Whalers Village
There are a few high-end, reservation-required restaurants like Monkeypod, Leilani’s, and Hula Grill. We skipped all of these and ate at the downstairs food court every single night.

There is a place called Café Jai with good grab-and-go food. Burger, pizza, and poke places worked for us too. We are big-time foodies, and overall, the food in Kaanapali just didn’t do it for us. We don’t have bad reviews (except for Sheraton’s food), but if you really love food, Kaanapali may not be the right place to focus your time.

Luckily, we were exhausted every night from swimming and snorkeling, so simple food worked—but every night felt like it lacked that “yummy vacation food” feeling.

More Kaanapali Tips

Shaved ice closes around 6 PM every night, so get it early or you’ll be stuck with basic gelato or Häagen-Dazs.

Everything closes by 8 or 9 PM. Not a problem for us, but it will be if you like later activities.

No DoorDash except McDonald’s and Maui Brewing. We checked one night just to see if you think you’re going to DoorDash, you’re not.

Go whale watching! Best part of the trip. We could see whales from the beach and watched one humpback do about 10 breaches just from shore.

We also did a morning tour with SeaMaui, and it was awesome. We didn’t see close breaches, but whales came close to the boat, dove in and out, and we got great fluke views and could hear them loud and clear. The SeaMaui crew was fantastic and made it fun. This was our favorite part of the trip.

Snorkeling in Kaanapali is outstanding and great for first-timers. We spent hours in the water each day near the rocks and saw tons of fish, eels, and turtles (more on that next). The water is calm and safe. People jump off the cliffs, which is fun to watch—we opted out, but it looked fun. We saw whales from shore, and the vibe was bliss.

Turtles

What a blessing it is to have turtles near the shore who choose to come close for us to look at them and swim with them not touch, harass, chase, corner, scream, or feed them.

We were appalled at the lack of respect for these animals by children and adults alike. It was absurd. Yes, it’s incredible to have these massive gentle giants come so close, including the babies, but the encouragement parents gave their kids to interact with them made us ashamed of humanity.

Full-grown men were putting their hands out to block turtles from leaving the area on multiple days, different people did this. Parents allowed their children to chase turtles, feed them seaweed, and try to touch them. I felt awful for the turtles.

Fun fact: If you’re calm and swim gently, turtles will often swim right by or under you, make eye contact, and allow you to witness their grace. It takes very little effort to see them respectfully. Chasing and harassing them stresses them out and makes you look horrible.

So if you’re one of those people or allow your kid to do this you suck.

Kihei

We went to breakfast at Kihei Café and visited Lava Java both are super cool and worth the drive. Kalama Park was a nice coffee walk. We saw surfers and crabs.

We stopped at a farmers market and had some fruit. You could tell it was a local spot, but not cool Hawaiian locals more like a rich white people spot. One lady kept giving me unsolicited advice about my fruit and then was rude to one of the workers. Ew.

Overall, not much going on in Kihei.

Napili

We were saddened by how Napili played out. Napili Bay was packed, the water was scary, with super fast currents and crazy waves. No parking either. Not worth the trip. We were there less than an hour.


Overall, Maui is beautiful, and none of these inconveniences or letdowns ruined the trip. Some aspects were just underwhelming, and now we know more about what we want to do—and what we won’t—next time.

We hope this helps anyone planning a first-time visit. Open to answering questions and hearing others’ feedback too.

PS: We tried Miso Phat Sushi, and it was bomb. Highly recommend. ",14,1767403553.0,MauiVisitors,11,0.77,False

TL;DR: We broke up because of intimacy issues, still have feelings and now I’m confused about where we stand. There is also another guy entering my life. 

All the people I’ll talk about, including myself, were 19 at the beginning of the story, expect for one guy.

During my last year of high school, a guy 19M from my class and I became close. We hadn’t really spoken in previous years, but then we started talking more and he showed interest in me. We began getting to know each other and I really liked his humor. He was always polite and kind to me. Before me he had a short situationship that lasted about two months, but I don’t know why it ended. We started texting in March 2024 and we kissed multiple times for weeks. In April 2024 we went on a school trip together. At that time, we didn’t have a label and we weren’t exclusive.

There was also a girl 19F I met at the beginning of the school year who used to flirt with me. I was curious about what it would be like to kiss a girl. She was attractive and clearly interested in me. She was on the same school trip, and when she saw me and the guy being close, she got jealous, even though I wasn’t texting her much (less than once a week, mostly friendly but slightly flirty). With the guy, instead, I was really building something and getting to know him.

During the trip, she held my hand in front of the whole class and wanted to spend all day with me and my friends. One night, she told me I couldn’t choose between him and her without trying. She said that if I kissed her and didn’t like it, she would leave me alone and wouldn’t tell anyone. I felt pressured, I had the idea of kissing her but not like that. Even though I had feelings for the guy, I kissed her.

I did like the kiss, but I didn’t like how pressuring she was, and I felt uncomfortable with her attitude. After that, I left and joined my classmates. I was clearly upset, even though I said nothing had happened. That night, the guy and I slept in the same bed in the same room with other friends (nothing sexual). The girl got very jealous that I spent the whole night with him after me and her kissed and told my class about the kiss. I had to talk to the guy, and I felt terrible because I had lied to him earlier. He was hurt not because of the kiss itself, but because I hadn’t been honest. I explained that I felt pressured, and after talking for hours, we managed to fix things. (I’m telling you about this girl because I feel he had deep feelings for me and he decided to accept what happened).

I had to leave the trip one day early for a university entrance exam. When we saw each other again, we became very close at school, so much that even teachers noticed. He made me feel better about myself, like when he told me he liked my natural curly hair. He started being more affectionate, even in front of friends. We still weren’t officially together, but we clearly had feelings for each other. From April to July, this situationship continued. We went to parties and acted like girlfriend and boyfriend, slept in the same bed when we went to friends houses and became more intimate. We had sex at the beginning of July. I’ve always struggled with intimacy, and this is important to understand.

I’ve never told my parents about him. I feel ashamed talking about love and relationships because it makes me feel weak or distracted from school. My parents aren’t strict at all and I know they wouldn’t judge me, but I can’t handle all the questions they would ask. My younger brother has a girlfriend, and my parents are very supportive, but for some reason I really struggle to open up about my feelings. Living at home also affects my intimacy. I feel tense and blocked because I’m scared my parents might notice something. I feel like if I lived alone or in a dorm, I’d be more relaxed and able to explore relationships more freely. At home, I feel trapped between being an adult and being treated like a child and living in the same room and surrounded by everything reminding me of childhood. I know therapy would probably help.

Another important thing is that I feel like I have a very low libido. This isn’t specific to this guy, I’ve felt this way with others too. I almost never masturbate and when I told friends, they were surprised because they experience desire much more often. For me, it’s almost zero. Even when I feel a little desire mentally, my body doesn’t really respond and sexual acts feel very difficult.

After we had sex, we kept seeing each other and texting every day. Then summer came, and I traveled for almost three months, so we didn’t see each other. For three weeks, I was doing Interrail with friends and didn’t have much time to talk. He even called me to ask if he was bothering me. I felt bad, because I really did like him. At one point, he asked me to officially be his girlfriend. I wasn’t sure because I thought I might move to a city six hours away for university, so I said we could talk about it again in the fall. When I saw him again in October, he asked me again. I had decided to stay in my city, but I was extremely stressed about starting university. My program takes up most of the day and has mandatory attendance, and I wasn’t sure I had enough time or energy for a “traditional” relationship.

We have always had our own balance, how often we see each other, how we communicate, very different from a stereotypical relationship, and I don’t know if I can or even want to fit into that standard. I felt pressured from high school classmates, they expected us to act a certain way and that’s why I wasn’t sure I wanted that lable.

We kept acting like boyfriend and girlfriend for several months, from October 2024 to January 2025, just without an official label. I’d say we had been exclusive since May 2024 and I really liked him.

In January, we talked again and decided to officially call it a relationship. At that point, it was almost a joke with my closest friends: I kept calling him a “situationship,” but it was actually a real relationship. They never judged me or pressured me to act like a “standard” couple, I felt pressured only from high school people. 

From January 2025 to October 2025, we were in an actual relationship. We exchanged gifts and he was always the same polite and kind guy he had been from the beginning. I felt very comfortable with him. He wasn’t just my boyfriend, but also my best friend.

The only thing missing was sex. We always did preliminaries, but after July2024 we didn’t have complete sex anymore. I was very stressed because of university, we could only see each other once a week and usually not at his house. There wasn’t really an opportunity, but I also wasn’t in the mood. My libido was always very low. After preliminaries, it felt like my body shut down completely.

I know sex is an important part of a relationship, but since I didn’t really feel the need for it, I didn’t know how to find a balance with him. He was always reassuring, never pushed me, never said anything wrong and always made me feel loved and understood.

In October2025, he asked to talk. A few weeks earlier, I had already told him I felt bad and ashamed because I couldn’t give him something important to him in a relationship (sex). He had waited almost a year and a half (from July 2024 to October 2025) and tried to help me, but nothing changed. When we talked, he told me the situation was very difficult for him because he felt like I wasn’t attracted to him, and that it would be better to take a break. This really surprised me, I didn’t expect him to want a break.

I knew I wasn’t really fixing the problem, but in the last months of our relationship I went to the endocrinologist several times because of my PCOS and hirsutism. Unfortunately, I’m allergic to progestin pills and I can’t take estrogen. In a way, I was also hoping that seeing the endocrinologist would help with the sexual side of things.

What hurt me the most was losing my best friend. I was afraid we would become completely distant and honestly we never had a proper talk, so I don’t really know what he wants now. I tried to ask him direct questions like:

“Do you still have feelings for me?”

“Is the break only because of the lack of sex?”

“Do you want us to stay friends?”

He told me that acting the same way as before would hurt him. The break was also meant to help me not feel pressured to fix the problem, but that meant he couldn’t be with me while still being so close to me. We started texting less. I didn’t know if I could be myself or if I was bothering him, and he also started answering less. I understand that he’s busy, but before he always made time for me. Now it feels like he’s also using being busy to create distance.

We stopped seeing each other once a week and started seeing each other only once a month. Now it’s January2026, almost three months since the breakup and I’ve seen him only three times. The first two times felt like nothing had changed. We talked a lot, and once we even did preliminaries. We still have feelings for each other.

He told me he would wait for me for at least a year, but not for three. I didn’t really like hearing that. I understand that three years is a long time, but I feel like if he truly loved me, he would wait longer, since this isn’t something I can easily fix. Do you think this means he feelings are not that deep?

Our hangouts have still been very romantic. The last one was a week ago at his house. We cuddled a lot and I told him something I had noticed: he takes a very long time to answer my messages, barely tells me about his day or week and I feel like I’m forcing him to text me. His replies are very short and it feels like he only answers some of my messages. I’m texting him much less than before, and this hurts so much, because he wasn’t just my boyfriend, he was my best friend.

I went home thinking he understood that I would like us to text more. But this past week, nothing really changed.

Yesterday, I decided to text him because I want to start the new year with clarity. I asked him to be honest with me and told him I wanted to know if he was losing interest. He told me that he is distancing himself because the situation is hurting him, but that he would like to keep a friendship.

I can’t understand whether he wants to keep me close because he hopes something physical might happen in the future, or if he actually still has feelings for me. We are basically not exclusive anymore but he told me he is not looking for anyone else or anything. I’m very afraid he might start having an interest in another girl. I don’t mean a physical one but an emotional one. I don’t want him to text and get to know in a romantic way another girl. He told me he would tell me if this happens but, what if it’s too late when he tells me and he already has feelings for this hypothetical new girl?

Even if I still have feelings for him, there are also things I don’t like about him: the way he talks about his political views (even though they’re almost the same as mine), and the fact that he can be very childish when he’s around certain people. With me, he has always been very mature. We’ve had conversations I’ve never had with anyone else and I’ve always felt extremely comfortable with him.

Right now, the last messages we exchanged were him saying that if I want to talk in person, he’s okay with that, but that he doesn’t think there’s a big problem to talk about. Still, he’s texting me the bare minimum and I’m afraid of losing him. I’m okay with keeping a friendship because I still have hope that we might get back together, but at the same time I wonder if this whole situation shows that he might not be the right person for me. Do you think this would happen with the right person?

We’re both turning 21 in a few months. We’ve spent almost two years in this situationship/relationship and he’s very important to me. I honestly thought we might have had a longer future together.

At the end of October 2025 I went to a university seminar and there were some residents explaining us medical students some topics. We were divided in groups and I had this tutor 26M that was super nice to me and my group. Some friends and I decided to follow him and other residents on Instagram and the tutor texted me. He remembered my name and I was the only one receiving a message from him. At that time, right after the break/break up, I didn’t feel like getting to know new people. In addition, I still had/have feelings for the other guy. 

The tutor texted me few more messages and all our conversations were about university and his residency. After 3 days, and literally less than 20 messages between me and him, he asked me to see each other in uni and get a coffee. My friends and I think he wants to get to know me. This doesn’t mean he wants a relationship but I never know what to expect from guys. I told him i was very busy and maybe we could’ve had this coffee after christmas break or after exam session. 

Literally 2 days after I went out with my ex, the tutor texted me again asking me if I was less busy now after christmas break. Mind that almost 3 months have passed and he still remembers about the coffee. He is not pushing at all and he is actually very polite. He also had a great humor when he was my tutor and I think I might be ready to get to know new people but just for a friendship. We are texting a bit, mostly about university, but I answer only once a day because I don’t want to look too interested. 

I would say I’m interested in knowing him but I’m 100% not ready for anything more serious and I haven’t fixed everything with my ex. I’m just worried my ex is not the right person for me. 

I told my ex about him texting me in october and i told him about the coffee. He was a bit sad about it but I told him that I wasn’t even ready to meet people for a friendship. 

He is a bit older than me but where I live this age gap is actually not too much. I’ll see him for sure in the next years because we will be working/studying in the same hospital. 

Now that everything happened, my ex texting me less, me not understanding his feelings, the tutor remembering me and the coffee… I don’t what to do. I know my ex and I are not exclusive anymore so nothing stops me from texting the tutor but I feel bad. I feel bad also feeling my ex lost his feelings because when i texted him all those questions he didn’t really answered to all of them. 

Does my ex still have feelings?

Do I work on myself and start loosing the feelings I still have for him? (I know it would take years)

Do I distance myself as well? I really don’t want to loose him.

Do I get to know the tutor? 

I hope I haven’t forgotten anything. Ofc it’s hard to summarise all the feelings and emotions I felt these months, I hope I was able to describe these people correctly.

1q2gs1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/iosapps/comments/1q2gs1i/i_made_stash_a_simple_file_sharing_app_with_no/,I made Stash - a simple file sharing app with no size limits,"Hey everyone! I just released Stash, a file sharing app I've been working on because I was tired of dealing with email attachment limits, WeTransfer's size caps, and sketchy file sharing sites that compress your stuff or delete it after a week.



 The problem I was trying to solve:



 We've all been there - you need to send a large video to a friend, share a bunch of photos with family, or send project files to a client. Email says ""attachment too large."" WeTransfer has limits. Google Drive wants you to mess with sharing permissions. Dropbox wants you to create an account. I just wanted something dead simple.



  How Stash works:



  1. Open the app

  2. Pick any file from your phone (photos, videos, documents, zip files, literally anything)

  3. Tap share

  4. Get a link

  5. Send that link to anyone



  That's it. The person receiving the file doesn't need to download an app or create an account. They just click the link and download. Works on any device with a browser.



 But it's not just for sharing



 I've actually been using it as a lightweight cloud backup too. Have some important files you want to keep safe? Upload them to Stash and access them from any of your devices. It's like having simple personal cloud storage.



 Features:



  \- No file size limits - Send that 4K video, no problem

  \- Doesn't use your storage - Files are stored in the cloud, not eating up your phone space

  \- No account required - Just open the app and start sharing

  \- Works across all Apple devices - iPhone, iPad, Mac

  \- Clean, simple interface - No clutter, no ads, no nonsense

  \- Share links work forever - Unless you delete the file yourself

  \- Recipients don't need the app - They just click the link and download



  Pricing:

  There's a 3-day free trial so you can test everything out. After that, it's a small subscription - literally cheaper than a coffee. I wanted to keep it affordable because I hate apps that charge insane prices for basic functionality.



  Some use cases:

  \- Sending large video files to friends/family

  \- Sharing photo albums from trips or events

  \- Sending project files to clients or coworkers

  \- Backing up important documents

  \- Sharing music or audio files

  \- Transferring files between your own devices



  What's next:

  I'm actively working on updates and would love to hear what features you'd want to see. Already planning some improvements based on early feedback.

Rug goes. Keeping couch and chairs. 

Open to any rug and coffee table recommendations. Really any advise would be appreciated! 

It’s a weird great room layout. Tv is behind the arch area. ",5,1767403044.0,interiordecorating,5,1.0,False
1q2grrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1q2grrb/i_set_a_boundary/,I set a boundary,"My whole life I've been a people pleaser. Always putting everyone's needs before My own. Saying everything was fine, even though I had objections to what was actually going on in the situation. 

I matched with a girl on Hinge, and have really hit it off. I suggested getting coffee, and she wanted to grab lunch at this fancy place. It was a bit out of my budget. Now, normally my people pleasing would have kicked, and I would have gotten anxious and said ""Oh sure we could do that!"" And then I'd be stressed about how I was going to afford the place. Would she offer to pay? Could we split it somehow? So instead of going through all that stress I simply said ""I would prefer to keep it simple. Let's grab coffee after lunch around 2pm if that works?"" There it was. I actually said my preference instead of torturing myself with anxiety. If she had a problem with it, I was prepared to cancel. 

But you know what happened? Nothing. She said ""Sure, that sounds good. See you then!"" In this moment, I realize that I have a voice too. I can say my opinion. I can say my preferences. And it's okay if people disagree with me. Doesn't mean they hate me. And if they do hate me because I have a preference or different opinion something then that's their problem. 

This may not seem like a big deal, but it is absolutely a win for me, and I just wanted to share.",14,1767403043.0,Healthygamergg,3,0.94,False

I scrolled through the various actions and thought of coffee shops that offer a discount when you bring your own cup. I'm also tired of all the single use cups rolling around Uptown's streets because it's too inconvenient for folks to find a trash can.

I've had varying experiences with businesses and the BYOC model. Wedge Co-op cafe doesn't accept them which is kinda strange considering their bulk refill department is top-notch. Isles Bun & Coffee on the other hand gives you a $0.50 discount if you bring your own cup.

I'm curious if you know of other local businesses that have discounts or incentives like bring-your-own-cup? I would love to visit more businesses that share my values alignment.",3,1767403013.0,TwinCities,0,1.0,False
