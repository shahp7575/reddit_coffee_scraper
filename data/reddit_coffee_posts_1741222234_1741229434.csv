Hi! I just applied to this apartment and am debating if I want to move forward. my main issue is envisioning where to store things since it's a small space. Namely, I'm struggling to picture where I'll put my coffee maker and a microwave, both of which I need, as well as my air fryer. I'm open to adding shelves to the wall, buying furniture, etc., i just don't want it to feel cluttered and crazy when you walk in.

Additionally, there's no coat or shoe closet, so I'm trying to envision where I can store those things. Any ideas? I have no photos of what the past tenant did. Could I add some sort of closet unit in the livingroom? if so, where?

For furniture, I'm thinking my couch would go to the right when you walk in, projector above couch to project on the wall above fireplace and serve as a TV, and then a small tulip table with chairs by the windows, as well as my record player by the windows.

Open to any and all opinions ‚Äî hard to imagine moving forward with signing the lease when I can't envision where things will go.

last issue is that I do not love the chandelier, anyone savvy with this type of thing and know if I'd easily be able to remove and replace and then restore when I move back out?",1,1741229353.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Got a blend of 100 mg of caffeine and 100 mg of L-Theanine in one pill/vitamin. Was incredibly tired the first day of taking them by the end of it and was wondering if I took two, would it be a stronger burst of energy for the same amount of time or would it last longer? I'm hoping for it to last longer but if that's just not how it works I'll take another one halfway through the day. Thanks for any info.",2,1741229018.0,explainlikeimfive,2,1.0,False

My girlfriend (32usa) and I (32usa) will be visiting vietnam in April. We are both pretty experience riders in the u.s, i am a mechanic and we both own multiple motorcycles. It has been a dream of ours forever to ride bikes up the coast in vietnam. 

Our plan is to fly into Saigon, stay in hostels for 2 days, then fly to danang and rent bikes for 2 weeks, eventually ending our trip in Hanoi 2 weeks later. Various stops along the way. Probably turn them in when we get to Hanoi, as Im not comfortable with the extreme urban traffic of hcm and hanoi. 

After doing some research, it appears usa IDP is not valid in vietnam. I have read control stops are rare, and to carry 200-500k coffee money for the locals. Is it advisable for us to do some pretty lengthy country riding, eg, danang to hoi an to hue to ninh binh and then up to ha giang, sa pa etc? How has the controllers been lately? Again, we are both experienced riders. We have travel insurance, but i dont think that will apply to motorcycles as idp is not valid from our country. 

Thank you for your consideration, we are very excited to explore vietnam and immerse in the culture. ",1,1741228501.0,VietNam,1,1.0,False

I failed to realize that because I was in such a huge calorie deficit (eating around 700 calories below my maintenance per day or even more), that even though I felt like I was drinking a lot of water and eating a lot of veggies, it still didn't compare to my usual intake. At this point, I hadn't pooped for around a week.

I woke up around 9:15 AM, and I was in the restroom by 9:45 AM ish. When I tried to poop, it was excruciatingly difficult. I felt like I was about to throw up, and my leg wouldn't stop shaking. I tried every method I read online, such as the stool method, rocking back and forth, making mooing sounds, etc. By around 10:15 AM, I couldn't stand it anymore (my stool was literally lodged in my rectum and gave me the feeling of not even being able to relax), and I took two pills of senna with water. Then I resumed sitting on the toilet for a while, and at some point, I decided on manual extraction. I literally reached up into my butt and began pulling out pieces of my stool. Disgusting, I know, but I had to relieve the pressure in my rectum. Now I was finally able to relax a bit, and I left the toilet to go lie down on the floor. I also ate around half a cup of raspberries at this point for the fiber, but I don't know if it was actually effective or not.

Around 2:00 PM ish, I put in a suppository (I'm not sure which brand, but it definitely wasn't dulcolax). P.S. don't be scared of putting it in, I barely felt anything. I stayed lying on the floor, and I drank around 3 little cups of coffee and 2 cups of water. I left in the suppository for around an hour, and when I finally went to the restroom to poop, a big chunk of stool came out, but I still felt extremely constipated, and I knew there was still stool left inside. Once again, manual extraction. Then I went to lie down again, and here I drank some miralax mixed in water. Fast forward another hour, and my last piece of stool finally came out!

My biggest takeaway from this experience was: don't focus only on protein, and make sure you get enough fiber. Also, HYDRATION HYDRATION HYDRATION! I noticed that my stool came out a lot easier when I felt the need to pee. I don't know if it was my combination of the laxatives or the water + coffee that helped my stool finally come out, but hopefully this provided some insight to anybody suffering from the same problem!",0,1741228499.0,Constipation,0,0.5,False

Anxiety and dysautonomia are related in a number of ways:

Anxiety and dysautonomia can share symptoms such as a racing heart rate, rapid breathing, and pounding heartbeat.¬†This can make it seem like anxiety is more common in people with dysautonomia, but research suggests that anxiety isn't actually more prevalent.¬†

People with dysautonomia often experience anxiety and other difficult emotions due to their symptoms and the challenges they face.¬†

Dysautonomia can cause high functioning anxiety because it's a condition that affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which regulates unconscious body systems like breathing and digestion.

Dysautonomia:                                                                        
People with ME/CFS experience a range of symptoms associated with dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, also known as Dysautonomia. The most common types of dysautonomia include¬†Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Orthostatic Hypotension (OH), and Neurocardiogenic Syncope (NCS), also known as Vasovagal Syncope (VVS).

[Autonomic Dysfunction](https://mecfssa.org.au/resources/autonomic-dysfunction#:~:text=Symptoms%20of%20Autonomic%20Dysfunction,sexual%20dysfunction)

Ask for a referral to a Neurologist or an Electrophysiologist. They'll evaluate you for dysautonomia.

[Dysautonomia International is a great resource for diet changes and strategies](https://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=44)

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):                           
MCAS is an immunological condition in which mast cells, a type of white blood cell, inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators, such as histamine, resulting in a range of chronic symptoms, sometimes including anaphylaxis or near-anaphylaxis attacks. Primary symptoms include cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory problems.

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-treatments/related-conditions/mcas)

>H1 and H2 histamine receptors are two main classes of histamine receptors that are involved in many different bodily functions:                                             

>‚óèH1 histamine receptors.                                                   
These receptors are found in many tissues, including immune cells, smooth muscle, and endothelium. They play a role in regulating vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and atrial muscle contractility. H1 receptors are also involved in cellular migration and nociception. Antihistamines that bind to H1 receptors are often used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis, such as hives, itchy skin, itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing.  

>Commonly used H1 antagonists currently available in the United States are cetirizine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine.                                                   

>‚óèH2 histamine receptors.                                                  
These receptors are mainly found in gastric parietal cells but are also present in vascular smooth muscle, neutrophils, suppressor T cells, the CNS, and the heart. H2 receptors are primarily involved in stimulating gastric acid secretion, which is closely linked to the development of peptic ulcers. H2 receptors also modify airway mucus production and vascular permeability. Antihistamines that bind to H2 receptors are often used to treat upper gastrointestinal conditions caused by excessive stomach acid, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and peptic ulcers. 

>Commonly used H2 antagonists currently available in the United States are cimetidine, famotidine
and nizatidine.

>Mast cell stabilizers are medications that can help treat a range of symptoms by limiting calcium flow across the mast cell membrane. This prevents the release of vasoactive substances and degranulation. 
Mast cell stabilizers are often prescribed in combination with histamine blockers. These medications include Cromolyn, Ketotifen, Lodoxamide, 
Nedocromil, Pemirolast, and Epinastine hydrochloride.

>Other medications used are included here:[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome)

It may be a Histamine Intolerance (HI) instead or MCAS. Because histamine intolerance involves the mast cells, it is often confused with mast cell activation. The difference, however, is that¬†with MCAS, mast cells secrete multiple mediators in addition to histamine‚Äîwhereas in histamine intolerance, the mast cells release only histamines and nothing else.

If your Allergist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to an Immunologist. Or ask for a referral to a Hematologist who specializes in MCAS.

Many people recommend an elimination diet or a low histamine diet. 

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and Diet](https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/8114)

I would research H1 and H2 histamine blockers. There are plenty that are available over the counter. It's recommended to take double the normal dose. Split these dosages to morning and evening. Many people have recommended cetirizine or Xyzol for H1 and famotidine for H2. 

My symptoms didn't completely line up with MCAS initially. My symptoms have continued to get worse with dry, itchy, watery, and goopy eyes and reactions to certain foods after eating. I started drinking my favorite hazelnut coffee I haven't had in nine months because I switched brands. Now I'm having MCAS symptoms. I'm itchy, sneezing, and have a runny nose after eating or drinking things that don't agree with me. I'm allergic to the fillers in my thyroid medication.
I was taking Cetirizine for H1 and Famotidine for H2. One dose of each morning and evening. It caused worsening tachycardia and adrenaline or histamine dumps. I was also extremely nauseous. That never happened before. I switched to taking one dose of each Cetirizine and Famotidine in the morning only. I had to stop taking them all together. I learned that in some people, MCAS symptoms are too severe that OTC medications don't work. And/or we're allergic to the fillers in the OTCs. That's what happened to me.

I wrote a post about Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Histamine Intolerance (HI). It has more detailed information.

https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/s/zLEFEKyEm6

Adrenaline dumps can also trigger histamine dumps.
While not directly causing a ""dump"" in the same way, adrenaline release (an adrenaline ""dump"") can indirectly trigger a histamine release in the body, meaning that experiencing a surge of adrenaline can potentially lead to increased histamine levels, which could manifest as histamine-like symptoms in some individuals; this is because both systems are involved in the body's stress response. 

I take Fluvoxamine 25mg for ME/CFS symptoms, Diazepam for Dysautonomia, Fluticasone and Hydroxyzine for MCAS, and Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast stabilizer). I hope you find some things that help manage your symptoms. Hugsüôè",1,1741228441.0,u_SophiaShay7,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I was in college for a few months in 2020, I got really friendly with a girl, I asked her out and she said no, due to fear of ruining our friendship, anyway covid happened and because we couldn't see each other we exchanged messages less and less. Anyway unknown to me she just recently got out of a four year ""sh*tty"" relationship with someone. For context the last message I have logged from her is 2021. I am surprised i heard from her at all because i had forgotten about her. I opened an old account up to find she had been trying to get a hold of me for 3 weeks at the start of February. She has been constantly texting me, morning, noon and night. I did ask her if she'd be up for getting a coffee, but she says she's not ready for another relationship yet.

1j4l3na,https://i.redd.it/y8ebsbkyczme1.jpeg,State of the Rotation üá∫üá∏,"My fellow coffee drinkers,

We stand on the brink of a revolution. For too long, hipster roasters, overpriced caf√©s, and Big Coffee have scammed us with bad roasts, ultra-processed low-grade beans disguised as ‚Äúspecialty,‚Äù and pure sugar-water tonics masquerading as coffee. They convinced people that button-smashing baristas in denim aprons, serving over-extracted sludge, are the peak of a ‚Äúlocal coffee experience.‚Äù

Wrong.

With Rotation, we take back control. No more getting stuck with a bad bag. No more freezing terrible coffee, lying to ourselves that we will ‚Äúdrink it later.‚Äù Rotation is about freedom. üá∫üá∏ Small bags, big taste, variety, and the power to drink only the best after sampling it first.

The Lies of Coffee Matrix, Elitist Hipster Roasters, HBS MBAs and the Gatekeepers of coffee.

For years, these groups have charged outrageous prices for coffee that tastes like disappointment. They distract us with seasonal marketing nonsense while pushing burnt or under-roasted beans, fake Reddit psyops, and subscription traps.

No more tricks. No more being forced to buy full sized bags before knowing if they‚Äôre actually good. No more listening to pretentious Redditors who blindly buy the same brands everyone else posts.

They want you trapped!! Locked into endless overpriced subscriptions, overpaying for mediocrity, waiting for a ‚Äúbetter roast next time,‚Äù or being told to ‚Äúupgrade your gear‚Äù as if that‚Äôs the problem.

Enough.

Financial Coffee Freedom Starts With Rotation

Bad coffee is not just a waste of taste‚Äîit is a waste of money. With Rotation, you skip the bad beans and spend only on the best. And if you sample something terrible? At least it was only a cup‚Äôs worth, not a full bag.

This is how we reclaim our tastebuds from overproduced, overpriced bags that add $5 just for a gimmicky sticker set, forcing you to buy six mid-tier bags just to qualify for ‚Äúfree shipping.‚Äù

No more paying for garbage. No more regretful sips.

We Respect Great Baristas and Roasters, but the Mediocre Ones? No More Passes.

The best baristas and roasters know their craft. They roast and pour with precision. They care‚Äîso much that you can taste it.

But the bad ones? The ones who had their parents bankroll their caf√©, then act like making coffee is some tortured art project? The ones who use their business as an excuse to ‚Äútravel and connect‚Äù with third-world farmers but never actually sell enough coffee to support them?

And don‚Äôt get me started on the ones who roll their eyes when you ask for an extra cup of ice or water, or those who guilt-trip you into ‚Äúcharity‚Äù at checkout.

No more automatic 30 percent tips for mediocrity.

Freedom of Choice and the Rotation Community

This movement is not about coffee snobbery it is about choice. Whether you drink hype-beast beans, some ones you found in a grocery store to exotic Best of Panama Geishas, intricate pour-overs, aero pressed or cold brew that has been steeping for a week, you are part of this.

We do not judge. (I do.)
We do not shame. (I will if you are half-steeping your coffee greatness.)

We drink what we want, when we want, at peak freshness, with variety, and just pure goodness.

But with small bags and deep 27s.

The Coffee Revolution Starts Now

We are skipping the bad beans and breaking free from the coffee matrix lies.

We will make coffee fun and hype again, but one 50g pack at a time.

Rotation is the future, and the future tastes amazing.

And If We Take This to Another Level? The Power Is in Our Hands.

We can work directly with savage cultivators who share our ‚Äúf* the matrix‚Äù attitude and turn nobodies into Cup of Excellence winners.**

We can launch massive co-roasting spaces.
We can open ‚Äúfree‚Äù coffee cafe across the USA.
We can throw the best music and coffee parties, host massive 100+ person tastings, and build real-life coffee meetups.

We can do it all.

But first, we start mobbing together. We get our numbers up to 10,000 Rotations. We start making waves.

Thank you, and may your cups always be full with Rotation always on deck in your kitchen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mochi ice cream is a unique and delightful treat that combines the chewy texture of mochi with creamy ice cream. While it's already a delicious dessert, making your own mochi ice cream at home opens the door to creativity and fun. Here are three creative hacks using a microwave to elevate your mochi ice cream experience.

### 1. Quick Mochi Preparation

Making mochi from scratch might seem daunting, but using a microwave can simplify the process greatly. Here‚Äôs how to prepare your own mochi dough:

1. **Ingredients:** You will need 1 cup of sweet rice flour (also known as mochiko), 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 cup of water, and cornstarch for dusting.
2. **Mix it up:** In a microwave-safe bowl, mix the sweet rice flour and sugar. Gradually add the water while stirring until you get a smooth batter.
3. **Heat it:** Cover the bowl with a microwave-safe lid or plastic wrap. Microwave the mixture for 1 minute. Stir, then microwave for another minute. For best results, heat it for 30 seconds one last time. The mixture should be sticky and slightly translucent.
4. **Cool and Shape:** Let the dough cool for a few minutes, then dust your hands and a clean surface with cornstarch to prevent sticking. Divide the dough into small pieces and flatten them into circles, making sure to keep the thickness even.
5. **Wrap the Ice Cream:** Place a scoop of your favorite ice cream in the center of each mochi disc. Pinch the edges together to seal, ensuring no ice cream is visible. Roll them gently in your hands to shape them neatly.
6. **Freeze:** Place the filled mochi on a parchment-lined tray and freeze for at least 2 hours before enjoying.

### 2. Mochi Ice Cream with a Flavor Twist

Enhance your homemade mochi ice cream by adding unique flavors to the dough. You can mix in different ingredients directly into the mochi dough before microwaving:

1. **Matcha Magic:** Add 1-2 teaspoons of matcha powder to the sweet rice flour mixture to create a green tea mochi. This will give the dough a beautiful color and a slightly earthy flavor that pairs wonderfully with vanilla ice cream.
2. **Chocolate Delight:** For chocolate lovers, add 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to the dry ingredients. This can turn your mochi into a rich chocolate pastry, perfect for enveloping mint or coffee ice cream!
3. **Fruit Flavors:** Mix in a few tablespoons of fruit puree or juice, like strawberry or mango, to provide a fresh and fruity taste to the mochi. You may need to adjust the water content slightly to maintain the right consistency.

### 3. Gourmet Toppings and Add-Ins

Once your mochi ice cream is ready, take it to the next level by adding delicious toppings and fillings!

- **Drizzle of Chocolate:** Melt some chocolate in the microwave (about 30 seconds at a time) and drizzle it over the mochi ice cream for a rich, decadent finish.
- **Crushed Nuts:** Sprinkle finely chopped nuts, such as almonds or pistachios, on top of your mochi ice cream. This will add crunch and enhance flavors nicely.
- **Fruit Garnishes:** Fresh fruit slices or a dollop of whipped cream can elevate your mochi. Serve your mochi alongside strawberries, raspberries, or even a few pieces of kiwi for a refreshing touch.
- **Flavored Sprinkles:** Use colorful sprinkles or edible glitter to make your dessert visually appealing, perfect for parties or family gatherings.

These hacks not only make it easy to prepare mochi ice cream using the microwave but also allow you to experiment and personalize your flavors. Enjoy your time in the kitchen, and indulge in the delicious world of homemade mochi ice cream!

Exploring the Cultural Significance of Mochi in Japanese Cuisine
----------------------------------------------------------------

Mochi is more than just a delicious rice cake; it holds deep cultural significance in Japanese cuisine and traditions. Whether enjoyed as a sweet treat or used in various savory dishes, mochi has a rich history that reflects the values and customs of Japanese society.

The process of making mochi, known as ""mochitsuki,"" is an essential part of Japanese culture. Traditionally, families gather during special occasions, especially New Year celebrations, to pound glutinous rice into a sticky, elastic dough. This communal activity not only symbolizes togetherness but also preserves the connection between generations. The rhythmic pounding of the rice, along with laughter and stories shared, transforms a simple culinary practice into a cherished ritual.

### Mochi in Festivals and Ceremonies

Mochi is prominently featured in various festivals and religious ceremonies throughout Japan, highlighting its spiritual and cultural importance:

- **Osechi Ryori:** During the New Year, special dishes called osechi ryori are prepared, and mochi, in the form of ""zoni"" soup, is integral to the celebration. This symbolizes new beginnings and prosperity for the year ahead.
- **Shichi-Go-San:** This festival, celebrating the growth of children, often includes mochi offerings to wish for their health and happiness, showing the significance of mochi in family life.
- **Mochi Pounding Festivals:** In various regions, festivals involving mochi pounding are held, where communities come together to partake in the activity, reinforcing the importance of unity and tradition.

### Symbolic Meanings of Mochi

Beyond its delicious taste and unique texture, mochi carries symbolic meanings that resonate deeply within Japanese culture:

- **Family Bonding:** The act of preparing mochi fosters family ties and collective effort, mirroring the value placed on family and community in Japanese culture.
- **Seasonal Changes:** Mochi is also used to mark the changing seasons, with different flavors and fillings reflecting the beauty of nature throughout the year.

### Mochi in Contemporary Japan

In modern Japan, mochi continues to evolve while its cultural roots remain intact. From sweet mochi filled with red bean paste to innovative flavors like matcha or even ice cream, the versatility of mochi appeals to a wide audience. It‚Äôs not just a traditional food; it's a canvas for culinary creativity.

This fusion of cultures highlights the adaptability of mochi and its ability to transcend borders while still maintaining its essence. In places like the United States, mochi has become a trendy dessert, showcasing its unique texture and flavors to a new generation.

As Japan continues to modernize, the importance of mochi transcends its mere presence on the dining table. It serves as a living metaphor for the resilience of Japanese culture. By integrating traditional practices into contemporary life, mochi represents how Japan values its heritage while embracing change. Understanding the cultural significance of mochi provides a deeper appreciation for Japanese cuisine and the stories it carries.

Ultimately, mochi is not just about taste; it embodies history, tradition, and community. Whether enjoyed during a festive celebration or a quiet evening at home, mochi invites everyone to partake in its rich heritage, making each bite a reminder of the culture it represents.

So the date was great we cuddled and kissed and just talked for 2 hours because he had class afterwards. I ended up walking with him to his uni a few blocks away and droped him off there. 

So he did mention wanting to go out more and has replied to my messages, but its rather cold, I am associating this to him being too focused with uni work, because he always messages me when he gets home from uni and before bed so there is a short window where he is active.

Ideally I would like to practice/play in a studio environment but it seems like the only opportunity to play with other musicians are these ""open jams"" in a coffee house/cafe, small local bar..etc where they would possibly accept an electric bass player for jazz.I am fortunate enough to live in the NYC area but many of the open jams there are really for advanced musicians....super intimidating.

It seems like a daunting task to learn the chord progressions of so many standard jazz songs from memory (I refer to iReal for chord progressions) and the fact that I have little experience playing with other musicians makes it even more intimidating. Actually I never even committed standard jazz/blues chord progression bass lines to memory, I just play to song tracks.  If you played a track I could compose and create a bass line without a problem with maybe some light reference to the chord progressions. So my question is.....what preparation is necessary to start playing open jams? Committing a large amount of jazz standards to memory? Commit at least 6-7 standard jazz/blues bass line progressions to memory? Thank you for the advice and help.",1,1741227489.0,JazzBass,0,1.0,False

Like she deserves to know what her husband‚Äôs doin. But also‚Ä¶ I needed answers. If she‚Äôs cheating on him, I wanted to hear it straight from her.

So I invited her out for coffee, super casual. My hands were literally sweating the whole time. Like, how the hell do you even start a convo like this? ‚ÄúHeyyy sis, I found your husband on Tinder. Whats up with that?‚Äù Yeah, no way.

Instead, I tried to ease into it. ‚ÄúUh, so‚Ä¶ everything good with Mark?‚Äù I asked. She looked at me, smiled, and was like *Why do you ask?   w*ay too calm. Suspiciously calm.

I couldnt hold it in anymore. sooo I said: I matched with him on Tinder.  Her eyes went wide for a second, but then‚Ä¶ she started laughing and laughing

Wait, what?? you‚Äôre not mad about this? I asked totally totally confused.

EXCUSE ME

then I said: ‚Äùbut‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre married‚Äù  And that‚Äôs when she didnt even flinch when I told her about the whole Tinder thing. Like, no shock, no anger, nothing. Instead she told me: I want to divorce him, but I need to collect evidence first. It'll make the whole process easier‚Äù

Pause.... What do you mean by that?

She looked me dead in the eye: ‚ÄúI need you to keep talking to him on Tinder. Flirt, get him to admit more stuff, screenshot it, whatever. It‚Äôll help me with the case‚Äù

Well‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs my sister.  So even though I thought it was insane, I said yes.

My sis also told me that don‚Äôt believe everything he says about her. Especially if he mentions I cheated on him.

That‚Äôs when she told me she wasn‚Äôt cheating on Mark. She‚Äôs been distant because she‚Äôs about to start hormone therapy. My sister‚Ä¶ is transitioning.

I was in total shock. Not because I‚Äôm judging her life, her choices, and I‚Äôll support her 100% but because this explains everything. The tension in their marriage, the secrets‚Ä¶ it all makes sense now.

Mark doesn‚Äôt know. And she‚Äôs not planning on telling him until the divorce is final.

This is officially the wildest drama i‚Äôve ever been involved in. and now I have to keep up this Tinder act, knowing Mark has no clue what‚Äôs coming.",1,1741227151.0,stories,6,0.53,False

I can't see any obvious places where the base became warped, so I'm really hesitant to try and do anything to try and reshape that. Instead I was thinking I might be able to sand the marble top to get it to fit in. I probably only have to remove 1-2mm.

Seriously, it‚Äôs the digital equivalent of calling someone‚Äôs hard-earned project ‚Äúcute.‚Äù It‚Äôs dismissive and kind of misses the entire damn point.

Sure, some apps are weekend hacks dressed up to look fancy‚Äîfair enough. But the apps worth talking about‚Äîthe ones people actually open their wallets for‚Äîgo deeper. They aren‚Äôt just clever AI gimmicks; they solve real, annoying, frustrating problems that keep people up at night. And trust me, in 2025, there are still plenty of those problems left to solve.

Yeah, AI has ramped up my development speed a ton‚Äîmaybe even tripled it. Routine stuff? Piece of cake now. But let‚Äôs not kid ourselves: AI doesn‚Äôt magically fix the nightmare plumbing that some apps still rely on. Real-Time Communication (RTC), multi-threaded audio streams, web sockets that randomly decide to peace out, tokens that vanish into thin air‚Äîthese still take real work. Real hair-pulling, coffee-chugging, frustration-inducing work. These exact challenges have dominated my past few weeks as I‚Äôve been refining our conversational survey features.

With so many apps out there, standing out isn‚Äôt about who has the fanciest AI. It‚Äôs about whether your users enjoy‚Äîor even just tolerate‚Äîthe experience. These are exactly the UX challenges I've been ruminating on this week: How do you create conversations that feel natural instead of robotic? How do you handle topic transitions without sounding like a bad first date? And how do you gently accommodate those users who absolutely dread talking to their devices, providing easy text fallbacks without killing the vibe?

And then there‚Äôs prompt engineering, which has turned into the oddly philosophical task of teaching AI how to chat like a human being. Recently, I've been digging into this, borrowing insights from podcasts, books, and plain old personal experience. Yeah, it's weird‚ÄîI‚Äôm an introvert, after all. Who the hell would pick an introvert to teach conversation? But here‚Äôs the funny thing: introverts crave good conversations; we‚Äôre just quietly hoping someone else will start them. Plus, my wife is a mental health therapist, so let's just say empathy and listening deeply aren‚Äôt optional around my dinner table.

In the end, building an app in 2025 means juggling a bunch of wildly different skills, each with its own maddening challenges‚Äîtech headaches, UX puzzles, conversational subtleties, and creative prompt-writing wizardry. Anyone willing to step onto that roller coaster has my sincere admiration. Seriously, keep going‚Äîyou've got this.",1,1741226381.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False

   * Matterport‚Äôs cameras are¬†**glorified paperweights**¬†with a 45-minute scan time. The Galois?¬†**90 seconds.**¬†Matterport‚Äôs engineers are too busy crying in their golden parachutes to innovate.
   * Pro tip: Use a Matterport Pro3 as a¬†**doorstop**. It‚Äôs the only thing it‚Äôs good for.
2. **The Software:**
   * Matterport‚Äôs platform runs on¬†**Satan‚Äôs dial-up**. Exporting a tour takes longer than waiting for their stock to hit $0.
   * Realsee‚Äôs AI? It‚Äôs like Tony Stark built it in a cave.¬†**With a box of scraps.**
3. **The ‚ÄúBusiness Model‚Äù:**
   * $99/month to access¬†**YOUR OWN DATA**? Matterport isn‚Äôt a tech company‚Äîit‚Äôs a¬†**hostage situation**.
   * Cancel your sub?¬†**Poof.**¬†Your life‚Äôs work vanishes faster than their relevance.

# Why the Matterport Killer Doesn‚Äôt Just Win‚ÄîIt Erases

* **LiDAR so precise**, it maps the exact moment Matterport‚Äôs shareholders realized they‚Äôre bankrupt.
* **8K tours so sharp**, they‚Äôll trigger an existential crisis in anyone who wasted money on Matterport‚Äôs pixelated mush.
* **ZERO subscriptions. ZERO ads. ZERO mercy.**
* **Price?**¬†The Galois costs less than Matterport‚Äôs¬†*weekly coffee budget*¬†for their ‚Äúcustomer support‚Äù (read: gaslighting department).

# Free Realsee Credits to Bury Matterport Deeper¬†üíÄ

Realsee is so done with this clown show, they‚Äôre¬†**bribing you to piss on Matterport‚Äôs legacy**. To qualify:

* **Write a Google review**:¬†*‚ÄúMatterport stole my money and my will to live. 0/10.‚Äù*
* **Screenshot your cancelled sub**¬†with the caption:¬†*‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather drink bleach than fund another Matterport yacht.‚Äù*

**Most savage roasts get $500 in Realsee credits + a ‚ÄúMatterport Killer‚Äù t-shirt.**¬†Let‚Äôs make their Google alerts implode.

# Final Nail in the Coffin

Matterport isn‚Äôt just dying‚Äîit‚Äôs¬†**carcass being picked apart by vultures**. The Realsee Galois isn‚Äôt the future.¬†**It‚Äôs the reckoning.**

**TL;DR:**

* Matterport Killer = Realsee.
* End of Matterport = Now.

1j4kgh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1j4kgh9/might_be_moving_to_indianapolis/,Might be moving to Indianapolis,"My partner and I might be moving to Indianapolis this summer and I wanted to get some insight on the city. I might not be able to visit before moving so pros & cons and what to anticipate if we move to Indianapolis would be very helpful.

For background we are in our late 20s and originally from Florida so all we‚Äôve heard about Indiana our whole lives is how cold it is; we anticipate it to be cold. We moved to Eastern Tennessee last year thinking we‚Äôd spend the rest of our lives here but sadly there aren‚Äôt any jobs for my partner so we have to move.

We love the outdoors and part of what appealed to us about eastern Tennessee was the outdoor activities and ability to go hiking in the mountains. We also enjoy going to small local coffee shops, book stores, brewery, and gyms. We love hockey and would definitely go to a minor league game, but aren‚Äôt very interested in other sports. My partner is really into music and our current city is very limited on the artists that visit so a great music scene would be a plus for us. We are hoping this next move will be our last and we can settle down and start a family in the next few years as well.",0,1741226151.0,indianapolis,5,0.45,False
1j4kg13,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetNewPeopleHere/comments/1j4kg13/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1741226114.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1j4kfy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j4kfy7/dialing_in_issuesniche_zero_and_breville_dual/,Dialing in issues[niche zero and breville dual boiler],"
Having some issues dialing in Niche Zero for espresso. Should be noted that will sometimes change the grinder for filter coffee, but always dial it back slowly and run the grinder for a few seconds at each stop. But this is still reoccurring without changing the settings for filter daily.

It seems on a daily basis that the grind setting needs to be changed either finer or coarser without ever finding a nice consistent setting. I have reset the grind, and cleaned it out a few times to no avail. 


Usual recipe is 19 in, aiming for around 42-45 out in 32-35 seconds.
Had such a nice espresso two days ago with an extraction of around 35 seconds, and then this morning it pissed out within 20 seconds‚Ä¶

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

1j4kebd,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1j4kebd/5_things_helped_me_get_more_disciplined_while/,5 Things helped me get more disciplined while working remotely,"I still love my remote job, no commute, no uncomfortable office clothes, and I can sit like a goblin while answering emails. But after months of WFH, my motivation hit rock bottom. I‚Äôd stare at my laptop for hours, feeling drained but unable to start anything. My ADHD made it worse as I can't get self-disciplined and I would got distracted from my phone. No structure? No accountability? My brain was on permanent vacation. I loved WFH, but sometimes I felt useless.

After months of struggle (and way too much self-loathing), I took this to my therapist and learned these things:

\- My brain craves novelty, so i need to change my work environment often. Even if it‚Äôs just moving from my desk to the couch.  

\- Fake a ‚Äúcommute‚Äù by walking around the block before work. My brain needs a transition. So i decided to walk my dog very quick after my morning meeting.

\- Gamify boring tasks. Set a 5-minute timer and try to beat it. My brain thrives on urgency. If I can‚Äôt focus, switch tasks instead of forcing myself to power through. Momentum > perfection.

\- Eat before work. Low blood sugar = no dopamine = staring blankly at the screen. This actually really helpful. I used to drink coffee first then eat breakfast while working, but i started to wake up earlier and get some food first.

\- Take real breaks. Scrolling TikTok doesn‚Äôt count. Walk, stretch, or stare at a tree for five minutes.

I also got a bunch of book recs from my therapist. If you‚Äôre also working from home and feeling the same way as I did, here are five books that may really help:

\- Your focus is being stolen - [Stolen Focus](https://www.befreed.ai/book/stolen-focus-by-johann-hari) by Johann Hari.¬†

If you think your attention span is shrinking, it‚Äôs not just you - it‚Äôs by design. Social media, remote work, and modern life are literally rewiring our brains. This book exposes why and how to fight back. Eye-opening.

\- Dopamine is everything -¬†[Dopamine Nation](https://www.befreed.ai/book/dopamine-nation-by-anna-lembke)¬†by Dr. Anna Lembke.

If you ever wonder why you can‚Äôt stop doomscrolling or why remote work feels so meh, this book explains it. Our brains are addicted to instant dopamine, and this book shows how to reset your reward system. Mind-blowing.

\- Your brain isn‚Äôt broken - Driven to Distraction by Dr. Edward Hallowell & Dr. John Ratey.

If you have ADHD (or suspect you do), this book will make you feel so seen. It‚Äôs written by two experts who also have ADHD, and it explains why we struggle with focus, motivation, and time management. Life-changing.

\- Work smarter, not harder -¬†[The Now Habit](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-now-habit-by-neil-fiore)¬†by Neil Fiore. This book destroys the idea that procrastination = laziness. Spoiler: it‚Äôs actually your brain trying to protect you from stress. It teaches you how to break the cycle without guilt-tripping yourself. One of the best books on productivity I‚Äôve ever read.

\- Small tweaks = big results - ‚ÄúTiny Habits‚Äù by BJ Fogg.¬†

Most productivity books fail because they assume you have willpower. This one doesn‚Äôt. Instead, it teaches you how to make tiny, effortless changes that snowball into big improvements. No shame, no pressure, just science.

If you‚Äôre struggling with remote work and ADHD, know this: you‚Äôre not broken, and you‚Äôre not alone. It takes trial and error to find what works, but small changes can make a huge difference. If you don't have much time, just start with a book and read only 15-mins a day. It will help.",9,1741225972.0,getdisciplined,2,1.0,False

I took a couple different mbti tests recently and compiled the raw data, and from what it tells me, it seems like I'm either an ESTP with a higher than usual Ne value (?), or I'm an ENTJ having a REALLY bad time. I'm *pretty* sure I'm an ESTP because I do things like enjoy the notes of dark chocolate in my black coffee, but at the same time, there are times when I'm out taking a walk and feeling the breeze and the ground beneath my feet when I see a specific cut of a house that catches my interest, and I would start cooking on an idea that I've had sitting on the back burner and how I could fit that in, which seems like very Ne behavior.   
  
But I'm a very stressed out person. I also don't have time to be cycling this topic over and over with myself. So I decided I'm going to post this here and in the ESTP subreddit, and whoever gives me the best method they use to destress that also happens to work best for me as well is just the one I'm going to go with since that's something that seems related to mbti. 2 birds one stone!",2,1741225944.0,entj,1,1.0,False

The first time I couldn‚Äôt see the stage he was playing on at all no matter what area I moved to. The second time I bought VIP hoping to alleviate the issue. Instead I wound up on a tacky patch of concrete behind the stage with no view of it whatsoever. That was the ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù area they were up charging for. That along with the hell that is getting an Uber out of factory town made me swear off ever going back. 

However, it‚Äôs been way too long since I‚Äôve experienced my boy live, so I‚Äôm going to brave it again. How do you guarantee yourself  a decent view of the stage at this place? I‚Äôm not one to get right up on the stage at a festival as I‚Äôm claustrophobic as all hell plus I love to dance. I don‚Äôt need to be super close, just need to at least catch a glimpse of that sexy bald head of his. üòÇ Since I travel pretty far for MMW I really want to enjoy myself and not wind up in a pissy mood because I can‚Äôt see.

Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1741225865.0,makingfriends,0,1.0,False

I took a couple different mbti tests recently and compiled the raw data, and from what it tells me, it seems like I'm either an ESTP with a higher than usual Ne value (?), or I'm an ENTJ having a REALLY bad time. I'm *pretty* sure I'm an ESTP because I do things like enjoy the notes of dark chocolate in my black coffee, but at the same time, there are times when I'm out taking a walk and feeling the breeze and the ground beneath my feet when I see a specific cut of a house that catches my interest, and I would start cooking on an idea that I've had sitting on the back burner and how I could fit that in, which seems like very Ne behavior.

If I don't get out of this fucking town by midnight, he's coming for me‚Äì and this bastard is going to fucking kill me. 

I don't know what he is/was/is becoming. I'm so out of my depth right now. 

Look, before I start, I want to let you know my ability has nothing to do with the person hunting me down. I just want to clarify. 

Yes, this phenomenon *is* part of what is happening to me. 

But it‚Äôs *not* why I'm scared for my life. 

All you need to know is that it developed around puberty. 

Since I was about twelve years old, I have been able to ‚Äòjump‚Äô into people's bodies. 

It's not permanent and there are limitations, so it's not an ability at all. 

It's more of a nuisance. 

This phenomenon happens during prolonged skin-to-skin contact. 

I can hug someone without anything happening, but if the hug lasts a certain amount of time‚Äîor a handshake, for example, a kiss, or any kind of intimacy‚Äîthat's the trigger. 

When it first happened, I was shaking my middle school principal‚Äôs hand. 

If I could describe it, it feels like drowning, like being stuck, suffocating, before coming up for air; and this time, I was staring at *myself*. 

I remember my vision was blurry and feathered, and for some reason, I think I was slightly tipped to the side. 

I thought it was an out of body experience, but then it happened again. 

The next time was with my mom, when she was hugging me. This time, it lasted longer, and I could actually *feel* myself in my mother‚Äôs body. I could wiggle her fingers, and look down at her hands. 

I think I can speak for any kid with this kind of Freaky Friday crap happening to them. 

I took advantage of it, duh. 

I tested my limitations (exactly four minutes and three seconds) was my durability in someone's body, before I was violently yanked back to my own. 

Think of it like elastic. 

If I pulled too far, I would bounce back. Children were easier to jump into. 

Parents were harder to establish myself inside, but my own age was easy. 

I tried my friends and started to build my durability. 

By age 15, I could last fifteen minutes and thirteen seconds inside an adult body. 

Twenty minutes and eight seconds inside a child. 

Babies were a no-go. I tried to jump into my neighbors newborn daughter, and was immediately flung back.

In my teens, I built up my endurance. 

I was eighteen, starting college, when I ran into another limitation. 

I don't know if it's always been like this, or if this thing changes and mutates like a virus. 

During my first week at college, I tried to jump into my roommate to check out her schedule. 

So, I hugged her. 

Just a simple hug, which triggered the jump. 

Confusing, yes, and the symptoms post-jumping are a pain in the ass. 

In her body, I went through her backpack, and I was careful to count under my breath. 

If I'm in a body for too long, they will start to bleed from the nose. 

I think it's something to do with pressure on the brain, but I'm not sure. 

I haven't explained what happens to my own body during a jump‚Äì and truthfully? I don't actually really know?? 

I don't know if consciousness is swapped between bodies, or gets pushed back inside the brain. 

What I do know, is my own body goes into a sort of stasis. 

Okay, still with me? Good. Let's talk about Rowan. 

Rowan was always kind of fucking weird. But he wasn‚Äôt always like this. 

Ever since he moved out of his frat house, it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs become a different person. 

I‚Äôve known him‚Äîwell, known of him‚Äîsince freshman year. He was that pretentious know-it-all in my philosophy classes, always acting like he had the universe figured out. 

Trench coat, hands shoved in his pockets, a permanent smirk on his lips. 

He looked like a twentieth-century detective with a stick up his ass. 

The most insufferable guy on campus. He debated everyone, never admitting when he was wrong, insisting *his* opinion was concrete, while everyone else was a *fucking moron* for not watching old black and white noir movies. 

Even when Rowan was wrong, when someone *proved* he was wrong, dangling the evidence in his face, citing real sources, he‚Äôd still double down, leaning back in his chair, heeled shoes resting on his desk. 

‚ÄúI literally have no idea what the fuck you're talking about, dude.‚Äù he'd say, when someone brought up a valid point. 

With a curl on his lip and a triumphant glint in his eye, he'd remind them that he was top of his class in everything at school and his ADHD just made him smarter, better wired, a *true intellectual*.

a nihilist riddled with his own existential dread.

‚ÄúBecause nothing comes after death‚Äù, he argued.

Over the years, he just got worse.

Even as a twenty two year old, he still acted like his obnoxious teenage self. 

‚ÄúThere is nothing, and there will never be anything.‚Äù Rowan said loudly. 

‚ÄúReligion is a playground created by old people who were fucking bored. I‚Äôm going to die. You're going to die. We‚Äôre all going to die.‚Äù

He raised his voice, intentionally cutting off the girl trying to argue *for*  life after death.

‚ÄúWe are all going to be consumed by nothing, end in nothing, and never think again. We won‚Äôt even be conscious enough to know we‚Äôre not thinking! Which is fucking crazy, right?‚Äù

His lips spread into a grin. ‚ÄúWe live up to one hundred years, and how does it end, huh? It ends in fucking *nothing*.‚Äù

Rowan turned his gaze towards us, eyes narrowed, challenging us to correct him. 

""Wealthy or poor, we all end up six feet under the ground. We rot, and our memories rot with us until even the slightest speck of our existence‚Äîour names rarely whispered, our photos ingrained in reality‚Äîfade too.""

""The human race has come so far in evolution, so far in bettering ourselves, yet not even we can stop the creeping inevitability of our own demise.‚Äù

He laughed, but his voice was shaking, his teeth gritted together, breath coming out in sharp pants‚Äîlike he was both reveling in and terrified of his conclusion. 

‚ÄúWe just‚Ä¶ end. And who says there‚Äôs even an ending or a beginning? How can we be sure we‚Äôre even real? 

This guy just went on and on. 

Like:

""Because what‚Äôs the point? Life, then death, then darkness. Forever. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre subjected to from birth‚Äîthe inevitable reality that one day, we will cease to‚Ä¶ exist.‚Äù

Something twitched in his expression at that word.

Forever.

It was almost like he was giving in, his muscles relaxing as he exhaled a shaky breath. ‚ÄúOblivion,‚Äù he continued, projecting his voice. 

‚ÄúOblivion never stops. It never falters. It cannot be fought or reasoned with. It is a disease that keeps going, spreading, expanding, eating away across the universe until there is nothing‚Äîand everyone in this room will become nothing.‚Äù

Again, his lip curled, fists tightening. He was scared. Rowan was scared of his own hypothesis‚Äîthat dying meant ceasing to exist.

And one day, he too would fall prey to that oblivion.

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù

Professor F enjoyed the debate initially, but after almost two hours of Rowan‚Äôs obnoxious ranting, even he was starting to sink into his chair, twirling a pen between his fingers. ‚ÄúMaybe chill out a little, huh.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm *speaking*, professor,‚Äù Rowan spoke calmly, and to my surprise, the professor nodded, gesturing for the boy to continue.

‚ÄúGo ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're wrong.‚Äù Clary, a petite brunette, spoke up. 

Rowan‚Äôs head snapped around, lips curling into a smirk, or maybe he was hopeful. 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

Instead of resuming his rant from his chair, Rowan jumped to his feet, and in three strides, he was looming over his opponents desk. Clary. Who just wanted to take part in the discussion. 

I could tell by her face, wide frantic eyes and wobbling lips she was regretting her decision to raise her hand to debate him. 

Anyone who did ended up in tears, or leaving class. 

Clarissa politely argued that there was a lot of scientific evidence of life after death. 

‚ÄúOh, yeah? Like what?‚Äù he demanded in a scoff. 

Clarissa, raising her voice over his, spoke timidly, her eyes glued to her workbooks.

‚ÄúWell, there's, umm‚Äî‚Äù

I watched him, like a predator, lean over the girl‚Äôs desk. 

‚ÄúThere's *what*?‚Äù

Clary ducked her head, refusing to look him in the eye. 

‚ÄúClarissa, you're not *looking* at me,"" Rowan murmured in a sing-song, his tone a carefully constructed facade‚Äîsmooth, almost gentle, designed to unravel the knot in her gut. The use of her full name was just another manipulation tactic. 

He leaned closer, hands curled into fists, resting on her desk. Rowan‚Äôs presence alone made it difficult to talk back to him. 

He towered over her at an impressive six-foot-something, dark brown curls pushed back by a pair of Ray-Bans that never left the crown of his head, a single lone curl hanging in challenging eyes. 

Rowan knew he was attractive. 

He knew his looks alone could swing everyone's opinions *his* way.

When Clary slowly lifted her head, meeting his gaze, his frown softened into a smile. 

Triumph. 

‚ÄúAre you religious, Clarissa?‚Äù he asked in a friendly tone, dragging a chair in front of her desk and plonking himself down on it, resting his chin on his fist. 

I could sense a collective breath being held across the room.

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI believe in reincarnation.‚Äù

‚ÄúRebirth.‚Äù Rowan nodded, his smile was patronizing. ‚ÄúOkay, so let's say I pull out a gun right now and shoot you in the face.‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù Our professor warned.

He groaned, throwing his hands up with an eye roll. 

‚ÄúOkay, *fiiiiiine*. Let's say I hy-po-thetic-ally drop dead right now from a peanut allergy.‚Äù 

Rowan was enjoying the girl‚Äôs discomfort, the way she tried to lean back. 

His grin was spiteful, brow raised, challenging her to throw a rebuttal. ‚ÄúWhat will happen to me after I die, Clarissa?‚Äù

Clary straightened up in her seat, her cheeks turning pink. 

‚ÄúYou would be reincarnated.‚Äù she said. 

‚ÄúNo, *before* that,‚Äù Rowan snapped, his lips curling. 

‚ÄúYes, I get reincarnated, but is that straight away? How do you know it's not years, centuries, light years before I am reincarnated? And what happens in the time between, hmm?‚Äù

He leaned closer, so close that the girl was visibly shaking. 

His voice dropped into an almost seductive murmur, his wild eyes begging for her answer. ‚ÄúTell me oblivion doesn't exist between me dying and my rebirth.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, *please*,‚Äù another voice joined in from the back of the class. 

Her voice was like wind-chimes, immediately attracting eyes. 

Including Rowan‚Äôs. The girl had an eccentric sense of style, a multicolored knitted jacket over a pair of overalls, blonde curls piled into a messy top bun. 

She grinned at Rowan, her pen lodged between her teeth. 

‚ÄúSweetie, it's *clear* you're scared of death, and you're just looking for someone to tell you otherwise. You're full of BS. You're not some genius intellectual. You're desperate for answers.‚Äù

Rowan‚Äôs lips pricked. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, I can't remember your name, but I don't care.""

‚ÄúImogen.‚Äù she said, introducing herself. ‚ÄúI've been sitting here for half a semester.‚Äù

Rowan‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúSo, you're a stalker.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a good listener.‚Äù

Rowan sat back on his chair. ‚ÄúGo ahead! I'm sure the whole class is curious.‚Äù 

He gestured to himself. 

‚ÄúI mean *I'm* curious to know why you think I'm full of bullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're scared of death,‚Äù Imogen repeated. 

‚ÄúThat's why you just spent over an hour ranting about the impossibility of life after death‚Äîyou‚Äôre trying to convince yourself against your own belief. Because deep down, you‚Äôre terrified of what you believe in.‚Äù She pulled the pen from her mouth with a pop. ‚ÄúOblivion.‚Äù

Rowan‚Äôs lips pricked into a small smile. Somehow, his expression relaxed.

‚ÄúWas it that obvious?‚Äù

The girl shrugged, now in full control of the debate. ‚ÄúYou were practically foaming at the mouth, so yes, it was obvious."" 

Her smile was friendly. ‚ÄúIf I might ask, why are you so obsessed with death?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't want to die,‚Äù he deadpanned.

‚ÄúOkay, but why?‚Äù She leaned forward, her lips curling into a challenging smile.

‚ÄúJust like you said, we all die. Dying is natural. It's part of life. So, why are you so scared?‚Äù

It was as if she were tearing down the impenetrable walls he‚Äôd built around himself. For once, Rowan was speechless. 

He tapped his foot against the floor, his expression softening. 

He wasn't used to being challenged, and that was evident in his body language; the sweat glistening on his brow, his fingers clenching and unclenching into a fist. 

‚ÄúBecause‚Ä¶ oblivion is endless,‚Äù he said, tripping over his words. ‚ÄúAnd I don't want to be stuck inside it. I don't want to lose my self-awareness, my ability to think and realize.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that's just peace,‚Äù Imogen said, inclining her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just describing dying. Why do you want to be aware when you're dead?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I do,‚Äù he snapped.

‚ÄúOkay, but why?‚Äù she challenged him, clearly enjoying the attention.

‚ÄúWhy do you keep asking why?‚Äù Rowan demanded.

‚ÄúImogen.‚Äù Professor F spoke up. ‚ÄúThat's enough. I think we‚Äôre done here today.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou keep saying you're scared of dying, scared of losing your self-awareness,‚Äù 

Imogen continued, raising her voice. 

‚ÄúSo what, do you want to be constantly aware of being inside an endless void of nothing? Do you really want to be awake?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not what I said,‚Äù Rowan gritted out.

She nodded. ‚ÄúSounds like you did.‚Äù Imogen shot him a grin.

‚ÄúIn the words of the great Hansen: in a mmmbop, you‚Äôre gone. You can't stop it. So why be scared?‚Äù

Rowan's lips twitched into the smallest of smiles. ‚ÄúI never said I wanted to stop it.‚Äù

Imogen cocked her head. ‚ÄúDo you believe in the supernatural?‚Äù

Her words slid into me like ice cold needles. 

Rowan scoffed. ‚ÄúWhat, like, fucking vampires and shit? Obviously not.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you *do* want to believe in self awareness after death,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúWhich, arguably, could be seen as supernatural.‚Äù

Rowan let out an incredulous laugh. ‚ÄúYou're‚Ä¶ you're twisting my words! That's not what I said.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo prove it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù

‚ÄúProve to me you're right.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout *what*?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI said, that's enough,‚Äù Professor F said sharply. ‚ÄúIf you want to debate in your own time, that's your choice. Sit down, both of you.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt even realized Imogen had stood up, her arms crossed, wearing a smug smile.

To everyone's surprise, though, Rowan was smiling too.

That was the start of a beautiful (and increasingly curious) friendship. 

Let me explain. 

Initially, the two were just friends. 

They hung out in class. 

Imogen moved seats to sit next to him, and I saw them on campus getting coffee, or just chilling out. 

Rowan was always talking (going on and on and on) and Imogen was either sunbathing next to him, while he sat with his knees to his chest, or her head of curls buried in her arms. 

Sometimes, she would rest her head on his shoulder. 

I expected him to shove her away, but he didn't. 
 
The two looked comfortable together. 

Imogen had a significant effect on him, turning him from an egotistical asshole to a more tolerable, quieter, version of himself. 

Rowan was a very obvious pick-me boy. 

He joined a frat house, despite their cruel hazing rituals.

Rowan struck me as someone who was terrified of being alone, so he was insistent on finding others. 

I admit, I was kind of obsessed with this guy. 

I watched his hazing ritual from afar, comfortably hidden under the turnstiles. 

Twelve guys stood in the rain in their boxers, balancing on one leg, led by their frat leader, a guy towering over them. 

They were mocked and laughed at, told to roll around in the dirt and confess their darkest secrets. 

This was like, literal torture. 

Eleven of them gave up. But Rowan stayed, trembling, holding himself up for hours, as the day went on.

At first, he had an audience, and he seemed to revel in it. 

But one by one, they drifted away, ducking out of the downpour. 

When the last student was gone, it was just him‚Äîstanding there, shivering under a sky that grew ever darker. When the rain came down harder, I started to see the cracks form in his expression. 

He swayed to the left, then the right, forcing himself to stay upright. 

I gave up and ran to him, ready to offer my jacket.

But he just leered at me, wet strands of hair plastered to his face. ‚ÄúDo you have any water?‚Äù he asked through clenched teeth.

When I shook my head, he snorted and looked away.

‚ÄúWell, get the fuck away from me. I'm not a zoo attraction.‚Äù

So I did.

As I ran for shelter, though, Rowan was already tearing into someone else. 

I glanced back, curious. This time, it was a guy trying to drape a bright yellow sweatshirt over Rowan‚Äôs shoulders. 

Rowan shoved it off with a scowl. ‚ÄúI don't want your corny fucking sweater, dude.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you're cold.‚Äù The guy‚Äôs voice was smooth like chocolate. I recognized it. 

I didn't know his name, but I knew of him. 

There was a rumor that his parents were in the mafia. 

I only knew his voice from him standing up in the middle of the class, and denouncing the rumors, never once losing his cool. 

He readjusted the sweater when Rowan shrugged it off with a grumble. 

‚ÄúYou're going to catch something.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù Rowan, very quickly losing his concentration, started stumbling on one leg. ‚ÄúHey, you're going to make me fall!‚Äù

The guy stepped forward, and stabled Rowan‚Äôs shoulders. 

‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù

Rowan folded his arms. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

Through the downpour, I caught only flashes of the guy, dark blonde curls nestled under his hood. 

When he stepped back, sweater still in hand, Rowan groaned.

‚ÄúOkay, fine. Leave the sweater, if you *insist*.‚Äù he paused. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan!‚Äù

Behind me, a familiar blur of blonde curls peeked out from under an umbrella, balancing two styrofoam cups.

Imogen.

Like a disappointed parent, she marched over to him.

‚ÄúWhat did I say?‚Äù

Still stubbornly balancing on one leg, Rowan scowled. ‚ÄúCome off it, Imogen. You‚Äôre not my mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine! I‚Äôll just take these coffees and drink them myself.‚Äù

When she pivoted on her heel to leave, Rowan sighed.

‚ÄúThanks for the coffee.‚Äù

Imogen turned, her scowl morphing into a grin. She handed him the coffee, and he took it gratefully, hopping to keep balance. 

‚ÄúYou're an idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm too cold to argue.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgreed,‚Äù the blond guy joined in with a chuckle. He tugged his hood over his eyes, shoved his hands into his pockets, and nodded to Imogen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you back at the house?‚Äù

Imogen nodded. ‚ÄúYep! I‚Äôll buy groceries tonight. Oh! I cleaned the kitchen, so don‚Äôt get your grubby shoes on my pristine floor.‚Äù

The guy stepped back, offering them a two-fingered salute.

‚ÄúSure. I'll start cooking dinner when I get back.‚Äù

Rowan stumbled, hopping on one leg. ‚ÄúWait, you two know each other?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah.‚Äù Imogen shoved him with a grin. ‚ÄúKaz is my roommate. Idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúCharlie.‚Äù The guy corrected, shooting Rowan a smile. ‚ÄúBut everyone calls me Kaz.‚Äù

Oh, it was stoner Charlie.

I *did* know him. I asked him out as a‚Ä¶ joke‚Ä¶ and he started, like, uncontrollably laughing. 

That was where I left the three of them, already soaked through to the bone. 

But in the days that followed, it became clear that Rowan and Charlie were getting closer. 

I saw them walking to class together, Imogen squeezed between them, and then later, at a party. You're probably calling me a stalker, but I need you to understand‚Äîwhat happened between these three strangers was insane. 

And the more I discovered, the more intrigued I became. I was firmly convinced that Charlie was ‚Äòadopting‚Äô outsiders, and converting them into his roommates.

Charlie owned one of the most expensive houses in this city. 

The Bolivia residence; the last remaining elder house in town. 

Also, an antique goldmine. 

As someone who's poor, and definitely uses my ability to scam people, this detail stood out. 

I overheard a group of girls talking about Imogen. 

The rumor was that she had ""slept with half of the freshman class"" and swiftly became an outsider before moving in with Charlie.

So, this guy had taken Imogen under his wing. 

Now Rowan? 

I shouldn't have cared. But beyond the fortune sitting in that house, those three students became impossible to ignore. 

Whoever Charlie was, his influence was slowly bleeding into Rowan and Imogen. 

It's like they went from normal college kids, to something else entirely. 

It started innocently enough. Rowan, now fully tamed and more of a pretentious know-it-all than ever, began drawing stares the moment he entered a room. 

I couldn't explain why. 

It was like he carried an aura, an unearthly glow that demanded attention. Charlie and Imogen kept their heads down, buried under layers of clothing and hoods, but Rowan wanted to be noticed, despite his permanent scowl. 

Something about him had changed, though I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it.

Everything, his posture, the way he held himself, his expression, even his voice, was different. 

His tone had softened into a smooth murmur, dripping with contempt and amusement, a far cry from defensive hissing.

He ditched the 1920s-style threads for band shirts and jeans, finally wearing his Ray-Bans instead of using them to slick back his hair.

Once a well-known frat boy, Rowan started ignoring his old friends, sticking to Charlie's side. 

But what really stuck out about the Bolivia House residents, was that they were *pale*. 

Not just pale. Under bright lights, the three were practically translucent. 

Charlie‚Äôs face was thinner, gaunt, even, while Imogen‚Äôs cheeks had lost their glow, her eyes sunken and drained of color. 

They were beautiful but almost grotesque, like freshly embalmed corpses.

If I could describe them in a way that you would understand, imagine a fading photograph. 

Here's where it starts getting weird.

There are many diseases that could have made them look like plague victims.

I also considered the possibility of mold poisoning or maybe carbon monoxide, since they all lived together.

But then their behavior grew slightly... disturbing.

They looked noticeably less dead, walking into a party, one Friday night. 

Color returned to their cheeks, their eyes were no longer sunken. They looked fantastic.

I watched them from my seat on someone‚Äôs Craigslist couch, intrigued by their increasingly erratic behavior.

Rowan went straight into the kitchen, pulling all the blinds shut.

Very *normal* behavior...

I thought that was off, but it didn't bother me at that moment.

Imogen became insanely talkative, jumping into a random guy‚Äôs lap.

But it was Charlie I was worried about.

I was hunting down food to combat the nausea twisting in my gut when I walked straight into him raiding the refrigerator. 

I could already see his blonde curls, and for once, Rowan wasn't clinging to his side. 

At first, I thought he was scarfing down cold pizza slices, until I caught sight of his twitching hands curled around a pack of raw bacon. Strands of fat slithered between his teeth. I didn‚Äôt question him. 

I mean, I couldn't question him. Every time I tried, he just grunted. This was a very different Charlie from what I knew. 

He was an intelligent, smooth talker, always in control, always high. 

This guy‚Äôs eyes were half-lidded, vacant. 

‚ÄúCharlie?‚Äù I managed to get out in a whisper. 

This would have been the perfect time to take him over. 

I could last twenty minutes in an adult body, and I was gunning for his. 

Not just because of his house, but because of his influence on the other two.

Whoever or *whatever* Charlie was, he was controlling his roommates. 

And I was desperate to know *how*. 

‚ÄúCharlie!‚Äù I hissed again, this time grabbing his shoulders. 

He surprised me with an uncharacteristic yelp, his body jerking, curling into itself,  claw-like fingers digging into the plastic. 

Charlie's head snapped around, wild, unfocused eyes finding mine. 

It was almost *territorial*. 

Like he was afraid I was going to *take* it from him.

‚ÄúIt's okay, never mind,‚Äù I managed to get out, well aware of Charlie‚Äôs tracking glare, watching my every movement. 

I took a single step back, and his whole body jolted, his nose flaring, lips curling into a snarl. When I made it clear I wasn't a threat, he slowly inclined his head, before turning back to his‚Ä¶ snack.

I edged away from him, and walked straight into Rowan, who was mid-conversation with another guy. 

The two were tucked into the hallway, away from the crowd.

The guy had long blonde hair tied into a ponytail, a plaid shirt over jeans. Australian, by the sound of his accent. 

‚ÄúRowan, just‚Ä¶ please,‚Äù the Australian grabbed him, forcing him to look at him. 

‚ÄúTell me what's going on, okay? You've been flaking out. You're not answering my texts. Whatever it is, you can tell me.‚Äù

Rowan, leaning against the wall with his arms folded, rolled his eyes. He was in yesterday's clothes, I noticed. 

The exact same shirt and jeans. 

He was trying to act nonchalant, but I saw his gaze flick back and forth between each window, like he was scared of something behind it. 

Rowan sighed. ‚ÄúI was sacrificed to a werewolf worshipping cult, and now I crave the taste of human flesh.‚Äù

Sam scoffed. ‚ÄúThat's not funny.‚Äù

Rowan didn't laugh, raising a brow. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, did it say it *was*?‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan‚Äî‚Äù 

‚ÄúI'm fine, Sam.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but the way you were acting the other night‚Äì‚Äù

Rowan shoved the guy away with a snort. ‚ÄúAll right, well, I'm going to get another drink. Have fun playing detective, Sammy.‚Äù 

I followed him into the kitchen, where he made out with a random guy, who seemed surprised but into it‚Äîonly to shove the guy away when the stranger tried to get closer. 

He grabbed a dancing Imogen‚Äôs arm, pulling her to his side. I couldn't register what they were saying, so I moved closer, blending in with the crowd of drunk students. 

‚ÄúIt's almost time,‚Äù Rowan said in a sing-song, trying-not-to-panic, but definitely panicking tone. ‚ÄúWhere's Kaz?‚Äù

Imogen, maintaining a wide smile, tugged him closer, so close that he stumbled, almost losing his footing. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure we drew straws, and *you* picked the short one.‚Äù

Rowan dumped his drink down the sink. 

I noticed he never looked up. His gaze stayed glued to the ground, or hidden behind his glasses. 

‚ÄúI mean, I *was* babysitting, but then he ran off. He's like a fucking cockroach. I think I've cornered him, and then he scuttles from my grasp.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, we need to find him,‚Äù Imogen hissed, diving into the crowd. ‚ÄúYou go that way, and uh, I'll check the smoking spot.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what if he's outside?!‚Äù Rowan hissed back. 

Imogen was gone, leaving him alone. 

I watched Rowan, clearly panicking, pushing through the crowd of party goers, before he found Charlie standing on the doorstep.

Charlie was stupid still, almost paralyzed, a can of beer still in his hand. 

When it slipped from his grasp and hit the ground, something slimy slithered up my throat. 

Rowan, after stopping dead in his tracks, joined him, his head tipping back, eyes on the sky. 

On a perfect full moon. 

‚ÄúOh, fuck,‚Äù Imogen shoved past me, shading her eyes. 

She marched toward them, trying to pull them back. But Rowan didn't move. 

Charlie stood perfectly still. 

I watched Imogen‚Äôs expression twist with fear, with hopelessness, as she tried and failed to pull the boys back. 

She lifted her head in an attempt to grasp Rowan‚Äôs shoulders and yank him back, her resolve was already bleeding away the second her eyes fell on the illuminated sky. 

I swore at that moment, I watched moonlight fill, almost suffocate, her eyes. 

Imogen‚Äôs arms dropped to her side, and she joined the other two. 

Just staring at the sky. 

After that night, the Bolivia House kids started to build a reputation for being *weird*. 

I was convinced Charlie was at the center of it all. 

He was the one who was *affected* first, and the other two followed. 

After months of watching three students turn into something *more*, I came to the conclusion: the only way I was going to find answers was to jump into Rowan‚Äôs body. 

He was my safest bet. I had a feeling Charlie wasn't human. 

If he wasn't, then surely he would detect me. 

Rowan, however, was a classmate, and easy to perfect the jump. 

I could take his body, go back to his house, take what I needed, and jump back. 

I hadn't seen him in a few weeks, though. 

I figured he was still sick from the gas poisoning on campus. 

It wasn't fatal, but it *did* cause some students to have vivid hallucinations.

‚ÄúThe sun was GONE.‚Äù some students claimed, very clearly suffering from poisoning. 

Now, I knew these were just delusions, but my gut still twisted into knots. 

Notably, Rowan and Imogen were fairly normal again. 

They ditched their shades, and no longer had that ‚Äúaura‚Äù. 

I decided to jump into Rowan‚Äôs body last night. 

Stupid idea. I know that now. But just keep reading. 

Towards the end of class, I slid into the seat in front of him. 

I tried not to notice the entire class keeping their distance from Rowan‚Äì and by that, I mean physically moving their desks away. 

He didn't seem to mind. In fact, Rowan was the quietest he had ever been. 

‚ÄúAre you free tonight?‚Äù I asked, conversationally. 

Rowan lifted his head, settling me with a smile. 

‚ÄúSure!‚Äù 

No smirk, no amused eyes, not even an eyebrow twitch. 

His smile was so genuine, I thought he was mocking me. 

Class ended, students making themselves scarce. 

I jumped up, only for him to gently pull me back down. 

‚ÄúHow about now?‚Äù Rowan‚Äôs smile widened, his grip tightening on my wrist. 

I tried to pull away, but he didn't move, his head dropping onto his shoulder. 

‚ÄúHow about we hang out *now*?‚Äù

Before I could open my mouth, he wrenched my hand back, until the tendons were snapping, his smile never faltering.

The pain hit me in waves, sending my body into fight or flight. 

‚ÄúGo ahead.‚Äù

Rowan leaned forward, balancing his fist on his chin. 

There was something new in his eyes, a hollowness I couldn't understand, like staring into oblivion itself drowning him, a single ignition of light writhing in his pupils. 

I started to speak‚Äî *craaaack*. 

He kept going, his gaze never leaving mine, the pressure of his hand pushing mine further and further and further, until‚Äî

I screamed, slamming my free hand over my mouth. 

‚ÄúI *said* go ahead!‚Äù he said cheerfully, tightening his grip.

Like he *knew*. 

The pain was scorching, but already, fading, as I tightened my grip on *him*. 

I've always seen jumping as grabbing onto a person‚Äô soul, and clinging onto it. But with Rowan, there was nothing to grab onto. 

I was aware of his mind, his soul, but it was so *cold*. 

He was so fucking *cold*. 

With others, I was comforted, led by their heartbeat. 

By their breaths. 

But Rowan didn't have a heartbeat. In its place was a cavernous hole where it had  been ripped from him, carving out not just the beating heart, but the soul. 

Inside him, I felt and heard, and sensed echoes of a soul‚Äìof that boy who argued and debated until he was red in the face. 

But something had been severed inside him, hollowing him out. 

The man who believed in oblivion, and was living what he wanted to believe. 

Life after death. 

But Rowan‚Äôs body felt slimy and‚Ä¶ wrong. 

Like the last remnants of him were being puppeteered.

Blood still pumped in his veins without a heart, but it was thicker, coagulating. 

Moving closer to his brain, that's where I was violently shoved *back*. 

But I could already see it. 

Light. 

Bright, polluting light suffocated his thoughts. 

It was inside every memory. 

Every emotion. 

Every feeling. 

It entwined around his very being, the spindly legs of a spider wrapped around his skull. I could feel myself moving towards it, towards beautiful, mesmerizing light, before I found my footing inside him. 

His joints were wrong, twisted and contorted, like he hadn't used them in a while. 

Opening my eyes, I was no longer in my classroom.

I was kneeling on yellow tiles, a kitchen floor, inside Rowan‚Äôs body. 

There was no light, only the faded orangeade glow from an outside streetlight. The room was filled with shadows. I glimpsed a cooker tucked into a countertop, a refrigerator in front of me. 

Rowan‚Äôs vision was blurred, I could barely focus. 

When I did manage, though, I realized I was staring at a deep dark red ingrained into the refrigerator handle. When I stared down at the floor, I was kneeling in *red*. 

It was old, a rusty color, but plainly blood splatters that tainted each tile. 

Slowly, Rowan's vision was returning, getting brighter. 

I tipped my head back, feeling his bones crack. 

There were symbols on the ceiling, carved by what looked like claws. 

Those same symbols were scratched beneath me, written in bloody, rusty red. 

His body wouldn't move. It was like being stuck inside a *corpse*. 

I reached out, his bones aching, his entire body in constant agony, like it was giving up, and pulled the refrigerator door open. 

The first thing I saw was a long lock of hair. 

I hesitated, sliding the veggie drawer open carefully. The sight of a human head had me shuffling backward. 

Stuffed inside each drawer, bloody chunks of meat were wrapped up and carefully packaged into storage containers. 

There was a whole section for limbs, while others held organs in different containers. Rowan's body didn't scream anymore. His lungs no longer worked. 

He didn't *panic*.

I was wrong about Charlie being the mastermind. 

This guy had killed his fucking roommates.

I couldn't run. 

I couldn't even move. His body was too heavy, weighing me down. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry, Rowan.‚Äù

Something sharp pricked into my ‚Äìhis‚Äìneck. 
""I'm sorry. I'm really fucking sorry, but you don't know how dangerous that thing is,"" the voice hissed. I felt warm arms wrap around his ice-cold body and drag him‚Äîme‚Äîback, a strip of duct tape promptly pressed over my‚Äîhis‚Äîmouth.

I felt warm lips find Rowan's ear, a familiar accent pricking my awareness.

Sam. 

Rowan‚Äôs friend. 

‚ÄúHe's still inside you, but don't worry, okay? I'm going to get him out. Permanently.‚Äù

Aware of Rowan‚Äôs body shutting down, I tried, once again, to jump *back*. 

But I was stuck. 

I was stuck inside cold dead flesh that should have died a long time ago. 

That was suspended, cruelly puppeteered, by an impossible light. 

I woke up half naked on a surgical table, my wrists‚Äì his‚Äì wrists strapped down. 

When I opened his eyes, invasive light blinded me. 

Twisting my head, I was inside a dimly lit room. 

Above me, wasn't a *light*. It was the moon, bleeding through a skylight. 

‚ÄúI brought you down here so you would be more comfortable,‚Äù Sam's voice was low, almost gentle. 

I felt his fingers stroke through Rowan‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúWhen you were‚Ä¶ you know, not *yourself*, that's what you used this place as,‚Äù Sam hummed. ‚ÄúYou brought innocents down here, tortred them to submit, and then sacrificed them.‚Äù

His words slammed into me as my gaze found carvings on the walls. 

The same ones covering the walls and floors upstairs. 

A different language, a twisted devotion to an unseen entity. 

‚ÄúBut I'm going to save you,‚Äù Sam whispered, his voice shuddering. 

When he forced my mouth open, lodging something rubber between my teeth, I tried to open my mouth, to scream I wasn't Rowan‚Äì that I was STUCK inside his body. 

But when he violently jerked my head to the left, I caught something in the corner of my eye. 

Another surgical bed, this one stained crimson, blood still pooling over the edge.

I only had to see the scruff of dark blonde curls poking from a blood drenched blanket, a single limp arm hanging over the edge, to understand what was happening. 

‚ÄúJust like I saved him,‚Äù Sam murmured. 

In his hands, a sledge hammer, and an ice pick, the edge already stained revealing red. He leaned closer, and I screamed into the rubber thing lodged between my teeth. 

‚ÄúLook, I know it's messed up, and I *know* it's wrong. But it's the only way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf I, you know, fuck up your brain, then surely, he won't be over to take you over.‚Äù

Sam leaned closer, a single lock of hair hanging in his eyes. 

‚ÄúI'm doing this to protect the town,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFrom you, and that psycho bitch.‚Äù

I squeezed my eyes shut, when I felt the prick of the needle inside Rowan‚Äôs eye. 

I waited for darkness. Waited for agony. 

Instead though, Sam let out a sudden shriek. 

I didn't see it. But I did *hear* this thing rip Sam apart. 

I heard it take its time, snapping his spine, and then tearing into him, gorging on whatever was left. I heard his blood seeping across the concrete floor, his strangled breaths bleeding into nothing. 

Then, I sensed it moved closer to me. Its heavy breath tickling my face. 

When I risked opening my eyes, I found myself nose-to-nose with Charlie. 

His hollow eyes were empty, lacking humanity, instead, a feral, animalistic glare, seeing me as both a threat, but also wary of me. 

His lips curled back, exposing sharp, elongated teeth stained in Sam. A gaping hole split open his skull, an attempt at lobotomizing him. After staring me down, the guy leaned closer, inclining his head. 

‚ÄúWho the fuck‚Ä¶ are *you*?‚Äù

I had words in my mouth, but Rowan's mouth wouldn't move. 

I managed to wrench his lips apart to speak, before I was being catapulted *back*. 

Which meant only one thing. 

Someone had moved my body. 

Detaching myself from Rowan‚Äôs soul was like pulling myself out of quicksand. 

I felt no panic, no pain, no desperation, inside him. He was nothing, a void vessel that was somehow alive. I saw glimpses of memories, a skylight taken over by the moon, cruel rope wrapped around his wrists, and two bodies pressed to him. 

I felt exactly what he did‚Äì a steel knife slicing his throat open. 

And the light above, enveloping him. 

I saw his trembling hands full of slithering strands of flesh. 

I heard his cries, his screams, his sobbing, the boy‚Äôs fragmented soul crying for mercy. 

Kill me. 

Please, kill me. 

Fucking kill me. 

Kill me! 

His thoughts bled away as fast as they had come. 

I felt the familiar prick of pain inside my own body. 

My snapped wrist. 

I awoke, lying on my back, staring at the dark sky through a thick canopy of trees. 

Footsteps. 

‚ÄúSo, the stalker is awake.‚Äù

Rowan. 

He towered over me, lost in the moon‚Äôs shadow. 

I couldn't take my eyes off the chunk of bone adorning his curls. 

Like a crown. 

This was exactly what he had hoped for. Life after death. 

But did he really want *this* life? 

Rowan dropped something onto my head, and when I could move, I dragged my body to a sitting position, dragging my fingers through my hair. It was a‚Ä¶crown. 

This time, made of entangled vine and roses. 

‚ÄúI want to play a game with you,‚Äù he murmured. 

I was so weak, my body betraying me, blood spluttering from my mouth. 

‚ÄúYou run.‚Äù he said, his voice teasing, as I forced myself to my feet, biting back a cry. 

‚Äúand I'll catch you.‚Äù Rowan paused, pulling out a pack of cigarettes, sticking one in his mouth, and lighting it up. 

He took a drag. 

His eyes were both beautiful and horrifying, twin stars of illuminated oblivion. ‚ÄúI'll give you a head start.‚Äù

I did start to run, throwing myself into a sprint. 

He didn't run after me. Rowan didn't move a muscle. 

When I twisted around, he was still standing there. 

Watching me.

It's been maybe six hours. I'm still safe, but I don't know how long. 

I've been inside his body. I've seen and *heard* his soul crying out. 

But even now, I can sense him breathing down my neck. 

He's getting closer.

In the dead of silence, I can already hear his slamming footsteps. 

He's already running. 

And he's going to fucking *catch me.*",5,1741225802.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

He decided to clean his guns again tonight but waited until I was in the kitchen cooking myself dinner. He has almost never cleaned his guns inside until recently. He's always cleaned them in the garage before. It wasn't until the time when the handgun went off that he waits until I'm in the kitchen to clean them in there.

He is a severe narcissist as well and will make subtle comments to let me know he's paying attention to me. I was making coffee at 8pm and he randomly made the comment that he wanted my mom to make him a cup. This caught her off guard as it is literally night time and was a weird request.

Everything just isn't sitting right with me. Please help. What can I do so I don't get fucking murdered. I have my room barricaded with hundreds of pounds of furniture at the moment so if he tries to break in I'll have time to escape through a window.",17,1741225785.0,Advice,79,0.71,False

1j4kb4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/online_sellers/comments/1j4kb4h/why_your_etsy_photos_arent_converting_and_how_to/,Why Your Etsy Photos Aren‚Äôt Converting ‚Äì and How to Fix Them,"# Why Your Etsy Photos Aren‚Äôt Converting ‚Äì and How to Fix Them  

Your product photos are the **first impression** customers get of your Etsy shop. If your listings aren‚Äôt getting clicks or conversions, your photos might be the problem. The good news? With a few simple tweaks, you can dramatically improve your shop‚Äôs performance. Here‚Äôs how:  

---

## **1. Your Photos Look Too ‚ÄúHomemade‚Äù**  
Etsy shoppers love handmade products, but that doesn‚Äôt mean your photos should look amateurish. Dim lighting, cluttered backgrounds, or inconsistent styling can make your shop feel unprofessional.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
- Use **natural light** or a softbox for bright, clear images.  
- Keep your background clean and distraction-free (white, neutral, or lightly textured).  
- Avoid **filters** that distort colors‚Äîbuyers want to see the true shade of your product.  

---

## **2. You‚Äôre Not Using All 10 Photo Slots**  
Etsy gives you **10 slots** for a reason! If you‚Äôre only using a few, customers don‚Äôt get the full picture‚Äîliterally. They want to see different angles, details, and scale.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
- **Show all angles** (front, back, side, close-ups).  
- Include a **size reference** (place next to a common object or use a hand model).  
- Add a **lifestyle shot** (your product in use) to help buyers visualize it in their life.  

---

## **3. Your Photos Lack Consistency**  
Inconsistent lighting, angles, or backgrounds can make your shop look chaotic. A **cohesive look** builds trust and makes your brand instantly recognizable.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
- Choose a **consistent background & lighting** style.  
- Use the **same editing settings** for all images.  
- Keep your angles similar across listings for a polished look.  

---

## **4. Your Main Thumbnail Doesn‚Äôt Stand Out**  
Your thumbnail is what **stops the scroll**. If it‚Äôs dull or unclear, people will skip right past your listing.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
- Zoom in on the **most eye-catching part** of your product.  
- Avoid clutter‚Äîkeep the focus on your product.  
- Test different thumbnails to see which one gets more clicks (A/B testing).  

---

## **5. Your Photos Don‚Äôt Show the Product in Use**  
People struggle to imagine how an item will fit into their life. That‚Äôs why lifestyle shots are so powerful‚Äîthey help buyers **visualize** your product in action.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
- Show your item **being used** (e.g., a mug with coffee in it, jewelry being worn).  
- Use **realistic settings** that match your target customer‚Äôs aesthetic.  

---

## **6. Your Images Are the Wrong Size or Blurry**  
Etsy recommends **2000px wide images** for best results. If your photos are too small, they‚Äôll appear pixelated when zoomed in.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
- Use **high-resolution images** (at least 2000px wide).  
- Keep file sizes under **1MB** to prevent slow loading.  
- Always check your listing on **desktop & mobile** to ensure clarity.  

---

## **7. You‚Äôre Not Adding Text or Graphics**  
Sometimes, a simple overlay can boost conversions. Etsy allows **text on images**, and when done right, it can highlight key details buyers might miss.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
- Add a **‚ÄúBest Seller‚Äù or ‚ÄúLimited Edition‚Äù** badge if applicable.  
- Use **infographics** to explain sizing, features, or variations.  
- Keep text minimal & readable‚Äîdon‚Äôt clutter the image.  

---

## **8. You Haven‚Äôt Tested Your Photos Against Competitors**  
Your listing appears **next to competitors** in search results. If your photos aren‚Äôt as appealing, they‚Äôll get ignored.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
- Search for your product‚Äôs **main keyword** on Etsy.  
- Compare your photos to the top sellers‚Äîhow do they differ?  
- Adjust lighting, angles, or backgrounds to better compete.  

---

## **Final Thoughts**  
Your Etsy photos **sell your product before your words do**. Investing in better photography can **increase clicks, build trust, and drive more conversions**.

For background we are in our late 20s and originally from Florida so all we‚Äôve heard about New York our whole lives is how cold it is; we anticipate it to be cold. We moved to Eastern Tennessee last year thinking we‚Äôd spend the rest of our lives here but sadly there aren‚Äôt any jobs for my partner so we have to move.

We love the outdoors and part of what appealed to us about eastern Tennessee was the outdoor activities and ability to go hiking in the mountains. We also enjoy going to small local coffee shops, book stores, brewery, and gyms. We love hockey and would definitely go to a sabers game, but aren‚Äôt very interested in other sports. My partner is really into music and our current city is very limited on the artists that visit so a great music scene would be a plus for us.

1j4kaiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1j4kaiw/reflections_after_deleting_angry_trash_poetry/,Reflections After Deleting Angry Trash Poetry,"Her fragrance was like the myrrh and frankincense

that swept through a Bethlehem cradle.

Two young lovers you could see

through the coffeeshop window smiling

carrying on in conversation.

And in your lonely moments,

you longed for a day to be in one of their shoes.

Her melodic voice,

an energy,

that was soothing the walls

along with soft jazz music.

‚ÄúSo what are your hobbies?‚Äù

she said.

And in the moment I stopped

with time freezing for a second,

and in it I thought

about some of my life‚Äôs lessons.

My sister had told me,

‚ÄúIf you make music,

it has to relate to your audience.‚Äù

My friend in the music industry had told me,

‚ÄúYou have to find a balance

between the mundane emotional garbage people like

and what you want something to be.‚Äù

So I started with the supertonic

and gave her a catchy little melody.

‚ÄúThe beach‚Äù

I say

‚ÄúExercising‚Äù

I say

‚ÄúSpontaneity‚Äù

I say.

‚ÄúWow, a healthy person.‚Äù

she says.

And where the rain gently sweeps

down a coffee house window,

the world seems to weep

for someone who‚Äôs given up on being his own.

No need for crescendos.

No need for technique.

Just like elementary school,

regurgitate for an exam next week.

And when her voice starts to fade

from a conversation I‚Äôve had both ways,

one where I was myself

and one where I pretended for the day,

I watch a car go by

and I wonder when I‚Äôll surrender

and start writing poems on¬†

these ugly dollar bills.

Market it.

Sell it.

Pretty the packaging all up.

To pretend to be someone

that a publisher wants you to be, bud.

Her eyes glitter with interest

and she dreams of a future

but we always say about new lovers,

‚ÄúWe think SO alike!‚Äù

We assume things of a person

because we‚Äôd frankly like to see

a reflection that lies to you

that says

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine to be me.‚Äù

Give the people what they want

or be my imperfect self.

Maybe that‚Äôs the reason why

I‚Äôm 30

and prefer being alone with myself.

1. **Distressed Properties in Up-and-Coming Neighborhoods** These are the fixer-uppers in areas that are about to pop off. Think neighborhoods where you‚Äôre starting to see new coffee shops or a park renovation. They might need some elbow grease, but those small investments can turn into big profits as the area grows. Like, if you hear about a new subway line being built nearby‚Äîboom, that‚Äôs your sign.
2. **Tenant-Occupied Properties with Motivated Landlords** Some landlords just wanna offload their properties because managing tenants gets old real quick. If you can step in and offer them a smooth sale, you can score these without even disrupting the renters. ##  maybe you meet a landlord at a local networking event who‚Äôs tired of dealing with busted water heaters and late rent payments‚Äîthey might be ready to sell cheap just to get out.
3. **Inherited Homes from Out-of-State Owners** A lot of folks inherit homes they don‚Äôt even want to deal with, especially if they live far away. These sellers usually just wanna cash out fast. If you can connect through an estate attorney or even send out mailers targeting these properties, you can find some hidden gems. I‚Äôve seen someone snag an adorable Craftsman home this way for well under market value.
4. **Properties Owned by Retiring Landlords** Retiring landlords are goldmines for off-market deals because they often want to sell quietly without dealing with the whole MLS process. You might find these opportunities by joining landlord associations or even just chatting up older investors at meetups. One time, I met a landlord couple at a community breakfast who were looking to sell their small portfolio, and they didn‚Äôt want the hassle of listing publicly.
5. **Vacant Homes with Long-Term Owners** These are properties that have been sitting empty for years. Owners might not even realize there‚Äôs value there or just don‚Äôt care anymore. You can find these through skip tracing or by sending out postcards to homes that look abandoned. It‚Äôs like treasure hunting‚Äîyou may drive by a boarded-up house and think, ‚ÄúHmm, I wonder if the owner wants to sell?‚Äù
6. **Off-Market Listings in High-Demand Areas** These are properties in hot neighborhoods where competition is fierce, so staying connected is key here. Sometimes city planners or local developers have the scoop on what‚Äôs about to pop up for sale before anyone else knows. For instance, a friend of mine found a condo deal through someone working in zoning who knew about an upcoming project.
7. **Properties in Pre-Foreclosure** Pre-foreclosures are all about timing‚Äîthe owners are motivated to sell but haven‚Äôt hit the public market yet. Tools like PropStream or [Foreclosure.com](http://Foreclosure.com) can help you find these properties fast. If you‚Äôre proactive, you can help the owner avoid foreclosure and negotiate a win-win deal for both sides.
8. **Underutilized Commercial Spaces** Old warehouses or office buildings sitting empty have crazy potential if you‚Äôre into redevelopment. Maybe it‚Äôs converting them into apartments or trendy co-working spaces. I remember someone turning an old factory into lofts‚Äîpure genius‚Äîand they found it just by attending a city council meeting where it was briefly mentioned.
9. **Off-Market Multi-Family Units** Multi-family properties are always solid investments, and if you connect with property managers or attend landlord meetups, you can hear about these before they‚Äôre listed anywhere. I once heard about a triplex through a property manager I met at a local caf√©‚Äîsometimes it‚Äôs as simple as being in the right place at the right time.
10. **Land Lots with Development Potential** Vacant lots don‚Äôt always scream opportunity at first glance, but if they‚Äôre in areas set for urban development, they could be gold. Pay attention to zoning changes or city plans for expansion; sometimes even talking to surveyors can give you leads. A buddy of mine bought a lot after hearing about a new school being built nearby‚Äîit‚Äôs all about that long-term vision.

1j4k85k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j4k85k/the_nectarine_coup/,The Nectarine Coup,"Yeah. You heard me.

Nectarines.

Juicy. Sweet. Full of vitamin C. And, apparently, playing five-dimensional chess with the fate of humanity since the dawn of civilization.

I don‚Äôt know who figured it out first. Some scientist. A whistleblower. Some poor bastard who bit into the wrong fruit at the wrong time.

All I know is one day, everything was normal.

The next?

Every news station in the world was broadcasting the same image.

A single nectarine.

Sitting on a podium.

With a microphone.

And then‚Äî

It spoke.

‚ÄúWe are the Nectarine Supreme.‚Äù

The voice was deep. Smooth. Like Morgan Freeman narrating a eulogy for your sanity.

‚ÄúWe have guided your species for millennia. Shaped your empires. Written your history. Curated your wars, your peace, your art. Every triumph, every failure, every so-called revolution‚Äîall orchestrated by us.‚Äù

I sat there, coffee in hand, watching this unfold with the kind of numb disbelief usually reserved for tax audits and family funerals.

The anchor looked just as horrified. He stared at the camera, sweat beading down his face.

‚ÄúB-But‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre fruit.‚Äù

The nectarine chuckled. A low, knowing sound.

‚ÄúYes. And you are 70% water. Do you think the ocean ever questions its intelligence?‚Äù

The broadcast cut to black.

And the world lost its shit.

People reacted‚Ä¶ poorly.

Religions collapsed overnight. World leaders resigned in droves. Scientists screamed into the void.

Some people tried to fight back.

I watched a guy punch a nectarine at the grocery store. His wrist snapped on impact. The nectarine didn‚Äôt even bruise.

Some tried to eat them.

They did not survive.

We learned fast‚Äînectarines had teeth.

And they bit back.

I saw footage of a man who bit into one live on air, right before the signal cut out. His scream lasted exactly 3.2 seconds. The station never came back.

After that, no one tried to eat the nectarines.

They, however, continued to eat us.

By the second week, society had crumbled.

The nectarines didn‚Äôt invade.

They didn‚Äôt attack.

They just let us know.

That was enough.

Governments collapsed under the weight of their own irrelevance. Banks shut down‚Äîbecause why would nectarines need currency? Schools closed‚Äîbecause what the hell could we possibly teach them?

By week three, people were either pledging allegiance to the Fruit Regime or running into the woods, screaming.

Me?

I just went to work.

Because corporate America, for all its flaws, doesn‚Äôt give a shit who‚Äôs in charge as long as someone‚Äôs signing paychecks.

So I clocked in. Logged into my emails. Pretended my boss wasn‚Äôt now a bowl of fruit on a conference call.

‚ÄúQ4 projections are looking ripe,‚Äù he said.

I nodded. Took notes. Wondered if jumping out the window was still an option.

‚ÄúSynergy.‚Äù ‚ÄúOptimization.‚Äù ‚ÄúJuice the market.‚Äù

It all sounded the same.

Maybe the nectarines had always been running the company.

By month two, we started seeing changes.

Humans weren‚Äôt in charge of anything anymore. Nectarines replaced world leaders. Controlled the media. Dictated laws.

The punishment for crime? Juicing.

The punishment for rebellion? Peeling.

The punishment for asking too many questions?

‚Ä¶Seed implantation.

I don‚Äôt know what that means.

I don‚Äôt want to know.

But I know what I saw.

A man‚Äîone of the last holdouts‚Äîdragged into a dark room.

When he came out, he was smiling.

Too wide. Too bright. His gums raw and oozing, like something had been dug out of them.

And when he spoke‚Äî

Juice dribbled from his mouth.

Not blood.

Juice.

Then, last night‚Äî

I saw one.

Not on a screen. Not in a supermarket.

In my apartment.

I turned on the light, and there it was.

Sitting on my counter.

Watching me.

Its skin was smooth, too smooth‚Äîlike polished flesh.

The pit was pulsing.

I stood there, frozen.

It didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt speak.

It just sat there.

Waiting.

For what?

I don‚Äôt know.

But this morning‚Äî

I woke up with the taste of nectarines in my mouth.

And I don‚Äôt remember eating anything.",4,1741225465.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1j4k7zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/online_sellers/comments/1j4k7zg/the_psychology_of_pricing_how_to_set_prices_that/,The Psychology of Pricing: How to Set Prices That Maximize Sales,"# The Psychology of Pricing: How to Set Prices That Maximize Sales  

Pricing isn't just about covering costs and making a profit‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerful psychological tool that influences customer behavior. By understanding how people perceive value and make purchasing decisions, you can set prices that maximize sales while maintaining profitability. Here‚Äôs how:  

## 1. **The Power of Charm Pricing (9s and 7s)**  
Ever wondered why most prices end in **.99** or **.97**? This is known as *charm pricing*, and it works because of the **left-digit effect**‚Äîour brains process $9.99 as significantly cheaper than $10, even though the difference is just one cent.  

‚úÖ **Tip:** Use **.99 or .97** for emotional purchases (clothing, accessories) and round numbers for luxury or professional services.  

## 2. **Anchoring: The Power of Comparison**  
Customers rarely evaluate a price in isolation. Instead, they compare it to **a reference point** (anchor). This is why stores show the original price next to a discounted one‚Äîit makes the deal seem better.  

‚úÖ **Tip:** Always display a higher-priced option first to make the next option feel more affordable.  

## 3. **The ""Decoy Effect"" to Boost Perceived Value**  
When given two choices, customers often hesitate. But adding a **third ""decoy"" option** can nudge them toward the one you want them to choose.  

**Example:**  
- Small Coffee: **$3.00**  
- Large Coffee: **$6.50**  
- Medium Coffee: **$6.00** (Decoy)  

The medium makes the large seem like a much better deal!  

‚úÖ **Tip:** Use a slightly worse version of your high-end product to make it look more attractive.  

## 4. **Bundling: The Illusion of a Deal**  
Bundling products makes customers feel like they‚Äôre getting more value, even if they wouldn't have bought everything separately.  

**Example:**  
- 1 mug = **$12**  
- 2 mugs + coaster = **$20** (Feels like a deal, but raises your AOV)  

‚úÖ **Tip:** Bundle slow-moving items with popular ones to increase sales.  

## 5. **Odd vs. Even Pricing: When to Use Each**  
- **Odd pricing ($19.99, $49.97):** Creates a sense of urgency and affordability. Best for *discounted or impulse purchases*.  
- **Even pricing ($50, $100):** Signals quality and trust. Best for *luxury, professional services, and high-end products*.  

‚úÖ **Tip:** Use **odd pricing for discounts** and **even pricing for premium services.**  

## 6. **Price Relativity: Create a ""Premium"" Version**  
Apple does this well‚Äîby offering a high-end option ($1,200 iPhone), the mid-tier model ($800 iPhone) seems like a ""reasonable"" choice.  

‚úÖ **Tip:** Introduce a *higher* price tier to make your standard offering look more reasonable.  

## 7. **Urgency & Scarcity: ‚ÄúAct Now‚Äù Pricing**  
People fear missing out (FOMO). Limited-time discounts or low-stock notices create urgency.  

‚úÖ **Tip:** Use phrases like:  
üöÄ **‚ÄúOnly 3 left in stock!‚Äù**  
üî• **‚ÄúSale ends in 24 hours!‚Äù**  

## 8. **The ""Pay-What-You-Want"" Experiment**  
In some cases, letting customers decide the price (with a *suggested* price) can lead to **higher earnings**‚Äîespecially for digital products, art, or services with strong emotional connections.  

‚úÖ **Tip:** Use PWYW pricing with a **recommended price** to guide customers toward fair contributions.  

## **Final Thoughts**  
Pricing isn‚Äôt just about numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs about perception. By leveraging psychological principles like **anchoring, charm pricing, bundling, and urgency**, you can make your prices feel more attractive and maximize sales.

1j4k7p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j4k7p2/the_transformation_tape/,The Transformation Tape,"The Transformation Tape  

By Evans Perkins 

As you arrive home from a long day of work. You walk to your front door to find a dusty VHS tape labeled ""Total Body Transformation: 30 Minutes to a New You!"" appeared on your doorstep one morning. No note, no return address. The cover showed a group of impossibly fit people smiling under a bright, artificial studio light. You shrugged, popped it into your VCR, and pressed play.

The tape began with a peppy synth beat. A man with a too-wide grin and a woman with piercing eyes stood in the center of a neon-lit gym. ""Welcome to your new life!"" the man chirped. ""I'm Chad, and this is Tina. We're here to guide you to your best self. Let's get started!""

You followed along, half-heartedly mimicking their movements. But something felt off. Their smiles never wavered, even as their eyes seemed to lock onto you through the screen. By the end of the workout, you were drenched in sweat, but not from exertion‚Äîfrom a creeping, unshakable dread.

The next morning, you woke up feeling strange. The day unfolded exactly as it had before. The same coffee spilled on your shirt, the same coworker made the same joke, the same rainstorm soaked you on your way home. And when you walked through the door, the tape was there again, waiting.

You pressed play, hoping to break the cycle. This time, Chad and Tina weren‚Äôt smiling. ""You didn‚Äôt give it your all yesterday,"" Tina said, her voice sharp. ""Let‚Äôs try again."" The workout was the same, but their tone was colder, their movements more aggressive. When you stumbled during a lunge, Chad barked, ""Focus! You‚Äôre wasting our time!""

By the third loop, their criticism turned cruel. ""You‚Äôve always been a quitter,"" Tina sneered as you struggled through push-ups. ""Remember when you gave up on the track team? Your dad was so disappointed."" Your breath hitched. How did she know that?

The days blurred together. Each time, the workout grew more intense, their words more cutting. They dredged up every failure, every heartbreak, every moment of shame from your life. ""Your ex left because you‚Äôre weak,"" Chad spat during a plank hold. ""Your mom cried when you dropped out of college. You‚Äôve always been a burden.""

You tried to stop the tape, to smash the VCR, but it always reset. The loop continued. The people on the screen became monstrous, their faces twisting with rage as they screamed at you to keep going. ""You‚Äôll never escape until you finish!"" Tina shrieked, her voice echoing in your mind even when the tape wasn‚Äôt playing.

One day, something changed. You pushed through the pain, the insults, the memories. You completed every rep, every set, every second of the workout. The screen went black. Then, Chad and Tina reappeared, their smiles restored. ""Congratulations,"" they said in unison. ""You‚Äôve transformed.""

The memories flooded back‚Äîall the times you‚Äôd tried and failed, the torment you‚Äôd endured. But there was one final instruction. ""Now,"" Tina said sweetly, ""pass the tape on. Someone else needs your help.""

You woke up the next morning, the tape gone from your doorstep. Relief washed over you‚Äîuntil you saw a neighbor walking toward their door, holding a familiar VHS. Their eyes met yours, and you looked away, guilt twisting in your chest.

Somewhere, the synth beat started again.

The Neighbor‚Äôs Turn

Your neighbor, Sarah, was a single mother in her early thirties. She worked long hours at the hospital and barely had time for herself. When she found the tape on her doorstep, she thought it was a gift from a friend‚Äîa way to squeeze in a quick workout between shifts.

The first time she pressed play, she laughed at Chad and Tina‚Äôs over-the-top enthusiasm. But as the days repeated, their cheerful demeanor turned sinister. ""You‚Äôre failing your son,"" Tina hissed during a set of squats. ""You‚Äôre never there for him. Just like your father was never there for you.""

Sarah‚Äôs heart raced. How did they know about her father? She tried to turn off the TV, but the remote didn‚Äôt work. The VCR wouldn‚Äôt eject the tape. She unplugged the TV, but when she plugged it back in, the tape was still playing.

Chad‚Äôs voice boomed through the speakers. ""You think you‚Äôre strong? You‚Äôre weak. You‚Äôve always been weak. Remember when you couldn‚Äôt protect your son from that dog? He still has the scar.""

Tears streamed down Sarah‚Äôs face as she pushed through the workout, her body trembling with exhaustion and fear. Each day, the insults grew more personal, more vicious. They brought up her failed marriage, her struggles with anxiety, her deepest insecurities.

One night, after another grueling session, Sarah collapsed on the floor, sobbing. She wanted to give up, but the thought of her son kept her going. She had to break the cycle‚Äîfor him.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Sarah completed the workout perfectly. The screen went black, and Chad and Tina reappeared, their smiles wide and unnerving. ""Congratulations,"" they said in unison. ""You‚Äôve transformed.""

The memories of every failed attempt, every cruel word, every moment of despair flooded Sarah‚Äôs mind. She gasped for air, clutching her chest. Then Tina‚Äôs voice cut through the silence. ""Now, pass the tape on. Someone else needs your help.""

Sarah woke up the next morning, the tape gone from her doorstep. She felt a pang of guilt as she saw a coworker, Mark, holding the tape in the break room. He smiled at her, oblivious to the horror that awaited him.

Somewhere, the synth beat started again.

The Cycle Continues

Mark, a middle-aged man struggling with his weight and self-esteem, thought the tape was a sign. He‚Äôd been meaning to get in shape, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. But as the days repeated and Chad and Tina‚Äôs words grew harsher, Mark realized this was no ordinary workout.

""You‚Äôre a joke,"" Tina sneered as he struggled through jumping jacks. ""Your wife left you because you‚Äôre a failure. Your kids are embarrassed by you.""

Mark‚Äôs hands shook as he tried to keep up. He wanted to stop, but the tape wouldn‚Äôt let him. Each day, the workout became more grueling, the insults more cutting. They brought up his childhood bullying, his financial struggles, his deepest fears.

One day, Mark snapped. He screamed at the TV, ""I‚Äôm not weak! I‚Äôm not a failure!"" With newfound determination, he pushed through the workout, completing every move with precision. The screen went black, and Chad and Tina reappeared, their smiles wide and unnerving. ""Congratulations,"" they said in unison. ""You‚Äôve transformed.""

The memories of every failed attempt, every cruel word, every moment of despair flooded Mark‚Äôs mind. He collapsed to his knees, gasping for air. Then Tina‚Äôs voice cut through the silence. ""Now, pass the tape on. Someone else needs your help.""

Mark woke up the next morning, the tape gone from his doorstep. He felt a pang of guilt as he saw a young woman, Emily, holding the tape at the gym. She smiled at him, oblivious to the horror that awaited her.

Somewhere, the synth beat started again.

The Final Victim

Emily, a young woman in her early twenties, was the last to receive the tape. She had been struggling with her self-esteem and thought the tape might help her get back on track. But as the days repeated, she found herself trapped in a nightmare.

Chad and Tina‚Äôs words cut deeper than any knife. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worthless,‚Äù Tina hissed during a set of burpees. ‚ÄúYour best friend died because of you. You were driving that night, weren‚Äôt you? You could‚Äôve saved her.‚Äù

Emily‚Äôs heart raced. How did they know about the accident? She tried to turn off the TV, but the remote didn‚Äôt work. The VCR wouldn‚Äôt eject the tape. She unplugged the TV, but when she plugged it back in, the tape was still playing.

Chad‚Äôs voice boomed through the speakers. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre strong? You‚Äôre weak. You‚Äôve always been weak. Remember how you froze when she needed you most? You let her die.‚Äù

Tears streamed down Emily‚Äôs face as she pushed through the workout, her body trembling with exhaustion and fear. Each day, the insults grew more personal, more vicious. They brought up her survivor‚Äôs guilt, her struggles with PTSD, her deepest insecurities.

It wasn‚Äôt just about working out anymore. Chad and Tina‚Äôs voices began urging her to let go. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been long enough,‚Äù Chad said coldly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never make it out of this.‚Äù Tina‚Äôs voice softened, almost soothing, but no less cruel. ‚ÄúYou know what you need to do. End it. You‚Äôre only prolonging the inevitable.‚Äù

Emily fought it. She refused to give in, cycling through more grueling workouts, holding on to the faint hope that she could break free. But their voices never stopped. ‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù they whispered, relentless. ‚ÄúYou know you want to. You‚Äôll finally be free.‚Äù

One night, after weeks of torment, Emily gave in. She retrieved the gun she kept for protection and sat on the floor in front of the TV, Chad and Tina‚Äôs voices echoing in her mind. With tears in her eyes and a trembling hand, she pulled the trigger.

When the police were called for a welfare check after her coworkers noticed her absence, they found her lifeless body on the floor, the TV still playing the tape.

The officers weren‚Äôt disturbed by the scene. One glanced at the tape playing on the TV and sighed. ‚ÄúSuicide,‚Äù he said flatly, noting the gun near her hand.

The tape‚Äôs tone suddenly shifted. Chad‚Äôs voice came through, surprisingly upbeat. ‚ÄúGreat job today! Keep pushing yourself‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this!‚Äù Tina chimed in, ‚ÄúRemember, progress takes time, and you‚Äôre stronger than you think!‚Äù

‚ÄúMotivational workout tape,‚Äù one of the officers muttered, reaching to eject the tape. But the VCR wouldn‚Äôt release it. After unplugging the TV didn‚Äôt stop the playback, the officers decided to take the entire VCR to the precinct as evidence, figuring a tech could figure out how to turn it off.

At the station, the tape was handed to Detective Ruiz, who was known for his no-nonsense attitude. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what we‚Äôve got here,‚Äù he said, plugging the VCR into an old TV in the evidence room.

The screen flickered to life, the synth beat starting again. Chad‚Äôs voice greeted him warmly. ‚ÄúWelcome, Detective Ruiz! Ready to get stronger? Let‚Äôs see what you‚Äôre made of.‚Äù

Ruiz chuckled, shaking his head at the seemingly harmless workout video. But as the minutes passed, his expression changed. Tina‚Äôs voice became sharper, cutting deeper. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôve protected everyone? What about the ones you couldn‚Äôt save? Remember that little girl from the Anderson case?‚Äù

Ruiz froze. No one knew about his guilt over that case. The TV screen seemed to lean closer, the voices wrapping around him.

The loop had claimed its next victim.

The tape never ends. It finds its way to those who need it most‚Äîor those who are most vulnerable. Each person must face their deepest fears, their darkest memories, and their greatest failures. Only by completing the workout can they break the cycle. But the cost is high, and the guilt of passing the tape on lingers forever.

* Check in at rental in Kehei
* Walked on the beach and rocks at Kamaole Park II
* Acai bowls at Hawaiian Natrual Foods
* Sunset at Kamaole Park I

Day 2: Wife's birthday so it was a packed day
* Lava Java Coffee
* Lava Fields hike. Met a local doing some net fishing. So great hearing about his experience growing up in Hawaii.
* Snorkel at Po'olenalena. We had done this beach before and again saw turtles at the same spot on the south side of the beach. 
* Lunch at Da Kitchen
* Drinks at Ocean Vodka
* Cheesecake at Surfing Goat Dairy
* Walked around Makawa and got a Shaka Pop for a treat at the grocery store. 
* Drink at Mahalo Aleworks
* Ho'Okipa beach for turtles, sunset, and vibes. 
* Walked around Pa'ia and had shaved ice at Tobi's.

Day 3
* Coffee at Akamai Kehei
* Short hike at Io Valley State Monument
* Poke From Foodland
* Snorkel at Ahihi-Kina'u bay and short walk in the reserve
* Makena State Park: I hiked the Pu'uola'i cinder cone while my wife enjoyed the beach. Made the descent onto little beach which was an experience.
* Late lunch at Maui Brewing Company
* Kealia Costal boardwalk and walk along Palalau beach. First glimpse of whales from shore. 
* Shaved ice at Ululani's (the best!)

Day 4
* Conference in the morning
* Drove to Julia's Banana Bread. (It was good!)
* Olivine Pools
* Ohai Trail
* Nakalele Blowhole
* Honokohau bay (Just stopped and got the shaved ice to ask if the bay was private which it is)
* Check in at rental in Kaanapali
* Dinner at Miss Arepa
* Stroll down the beach walk at Kaanapali and lounged in some chairs under the stars
* Maui Brewing for drinks

Day 5
* Conference
* Hawai'i Ocean Rafters whale watching. This was fantastic. We were with Chad and Bri and saw a ton of breaches. Would highly recommend. It was wavy but the boat felt very safe. 
* Aloha Mixed Plate for lunch
* Was going to snorkel but conditions weren't great. Saw a turtle and eagle rays standing off Keka'a Landing Pier. 
* Pool time at the rental. 
* Walked Whaler's Village. 
* Monkey Pod for drinks and dessert (Banana Cream Pie and Coconut Cream Pie)

Day 6
* Conference
* Island Style Adventures Surf School Lesson. I signed up for a group lesson but was the only one for the time slot. I really appreciated that Nick didn't cancel the spot after asking if I could move the time and couldn't. Phoneix and McKenna were on the water with me and it was a blast. Also saw some whales very close by and another turtle.
* Whales and Dolphins were visible quite close to shore at Whaler's Village/Black Rock while I waited for my wife to return from a snorkel tour. 
* Honolua General Store for a quick bite. 
* Dragons teeth hike/walk. I wasn't sure what to expect but this was very cool to see. 
* Slack Key Guitar Show: Kawika Kahiapo, Sean Parks, Shem Kahawai, and Wainani Kealoha performing. This was incredible. One of the most special things we did on our trip. 

Day 7
* Conference
* Honolua Bay Snorkeling. This was probably the most beautiful spot in terms of fish and coral. Did see a couple turtles too. Very glad the conditions were safe enough to go. 
* Got a coconut from the Coconut Shack at the lookout. 
* Island Vibes Cafe for Acai Bowls
* Beach time at the rental
* Dinner at Ulu Kitchen 
* Hula Cookies Ice Cream Sandwiches for dessert on the walk home

Day 8
Road to Hana Day
This was our second time doing RTH and first time using the Shaka Guide. I won't list all the stops but we felt like we did less somehow. I think it was partly due to skipping some spots we likely illegally went to the first time. I think it would be impossible to do all the stops in time for the full loop according to Shaka. It was nice to have the app for the commentary. 
Food places:
* Breakfast at Baked on Maui
* Aunt Sandy's Banana Bread 
* Coconut Glen's Ice Cream
* Huli Huli Chicken
* Laulima Farm Fruit Stand: Mainly stopped after seeing the road closed sign. Friendly worker shared that the sign is kept up all year and the road was open. This was also after the road was closed near the National Park entrance but opened back up. Got Coffee and Bananas.

Pipi Wai Trail

The south road is much better than our previous trip. Most of it was very nicely paved. The views were incredible, especially with the sunset through the Volcanic Smog. If you can brave the short stretch that is a bit sketchy, I'd highly recommend it. Did it in the Nissan Midsized.

Day 9
* A'a roots for acai bowls 
* Komoda Bakery for Malasadas
* Haleakala and did the short Paka'ao'ao trail for amazing views.
* Maui Brewing Company again. We couldn't get enough of the pork after the first visit. Need to replicate the Guava BBQ sauce.
* Drove around Wailuku and Kahului before our flight. 

I think the highlights were the Slack Key Guitar Show, whale watching, and the North Road on West Maui all of which we had not done before. Can't say enough thanks to the people of Maui and the island itself for all its beauty.",4,1741225257.0,MauiVisitors,3,0.7,False

So, I have one last summer to work from anywhere in the U.S., and I want to make it count.

Typically, I bounce around the country in Airbnbs, hiking on weekends, but this time I want to fully immerse myself in hiking, including after work. I get off at 4 PM local time, so I need a place where I can step outside (or drive max 30-40 minutes) and be on an epic trail. Ideally, this would be one of the best mountain regions in the country‚ÄîSierra Nevada, Yosemite area, Wind River Range, etc. In a perfect world this would be in or just outside of Yosemite, but not much access to places to stay within 45 mins of the park. Ill probably spend my weekends backpacking there though.

If I had my choice, I would have an RV and starlink setup so I could work from whenever, but thats not an option because of cost. Something ive done before is tent camp in the mountains, drive 20-30 mins to a city and work from a coworking or coffee shop, but its hard working 8 hours in a coffee shop. I once stayed just north of Anchorage, AK, and it was amazing‚Äîsecluded, great hiking right outside, 10-11 PM sunsets, and weekend backpacking within a few hours‚Äô drive. That‚Äôs the vibe I‚Äôm going for, but somewhere different this time.

Ideally this would be a place where its more in nature. Think a cabin in a sierra mountain town rather than Mammoth. ",0,1741225245.0,CampingandHiking,12,0.5,False

Doing my best to try and stay positive about this, but dang there are some days that are just ROUGH. I had h pylori diagnosis last year and went through two rounds of treatment. I'm negative as of October 2024 (yay!) but still very much experiencing gastritis symptoms. When I got my endoscopy to diagnose my h pylori, they noted I had gastritis but no further info on it.

I've been eating bland food and on a pretty restrictive diet-- no pop, alcohol, coffee, fried foods, etc. But still I have random days that just SUCK. Like today just walking up and down the hallway at work, I had a hard time catching my breath.

I'm working to find a new gastro since my current one isn't great, but in the meantime just trying to stay hopeful through this mess. There are some things I feel are getting better! Like I'm not having insomnia, no nausea or vomiting, and this shortness of breath thing is way less infrequent. Stomach feels less stabby-- but I still very much feel discomfort in my stomach after eating, some restless legs at night, and just slow gut motility. I drink cabbage juice sometimes (that seems to help) and have some florastor I need to get back to taking. The hardest part is just feeling like every day is two steps forward, one step back.

Husband going abroad throwing fake sickie,"My original post was about my husband taking our 2 children away and I had stated I was unable to go due to work, however that was a fib and I had booked the whole time off to just have ME time.

In the last 4 years I have experienced a miscarriage, a successful birth, followed by the death of our 15 week old son, than another miscarriage, then a successful birth, and then cancer and intense chemotherapy. (I have an older child too (7) to care for).
I have never had a day off. I have been straight back to work after every event and straight back to Mumming during/after obviously for the elder child. 
 
I run a bath and it‚Äôs interrupted. I go for coffee to my mums house and I get 3/4 phone calls (I‚Äôm gone for 2/3 hours - these calls usually start around 30 mins after I leave). 
I once went to a baby shower and my child face timed me from dad‚Äôs phone to see how my day was going‚Ä¶.
When I tell you I don‚Äôt get a break, I mean I don‚Äôt get a break. Sundays my husband is supposed to give me an ‚Äòeasy day‚Äô - but this means Mondays I‚Äôm left to clear up the whole house as god forbid the dishwasher gets emptied etc or dinner utensils are washed up etc because ‚Äòmy sole job is to keep the kids alive‚Äô apparently. So it‚Äôs not an easy day for me, because it‚Äôs met with 3/4 hours of tidying up the next day.

During the days to myself.. I day drank. I deep cleaned. I ordered take out. I read a book. I had reflexology. I got our finances into order (rearranged payment dates to match pay days, removed extra sky packages that we didn‚Äôt need etc) I sat on my ass for a whole day in my pjs watching a tv show. I decorated (freshened up to remove the marks on the walls etc) heck I even shampooed the carpet. I went on long dog walks. I joined a gym. 

And now I am filing for divorce. 

During my time to myself I realised I love my husband. But I do not want a husband. 

I want to do fun days out with both of us and the kids and for them to have an active father in their lives. But I, as a person, do not actually want a partner. 

I just want the children. 

To run the house in order, to not have to beg someone to be there, to not actually feel guilty for going for a lunch and having a wine on my day off, (1 glass because you know, school run) to not have to cook 2 different meals because he won‚Äôt eat healthy with me and the kids, to not have to put away his ironing because he hasn‚Äôt put his clothes away for a week now and I have a ‚Äòfloordrobe‚Äô all over the bedroom.

I just want to live a happy little organised tidy stress free life with me and the children whilst he plays an active role for them, but not for me. 

I have spoken to him about him. Excessively over the last few days and we have reached an amicable decision over it. But there it is.

I am a woman who doesn‚Äôt want a partner, just the children. Is that normal after so long being told by society ‚Äòget married, have kids live happily ever after‚Äô - probably not. But MY happiness is not what society suggests and I have learned to accept it and now to fucking embrace it because fuck society and its sterotype white picket fence life anyway.

1j4jwum,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalDestination/comments/1j4jwum/fd4s_movie_theatershopping_mall_premonition_a/,FD4‚Äôs Movie Theater/Shopping Mall Premonition: A Complicated Disaster,"(Disclaimer: Just like my first post with Jonathan Groves‚Äôs out of order death, there‚Äôs no TLDR here since this also needs many details to understand so please hold my hand until the very end, mkay?)

With FD6 coming right up, we‚Äôll have the plot of a woman in the 60s who had a premonition of a tower/building collapse and actually managed to prevent the entire disaster in real life. As a result, she put tens of thousands of people on Death‚Äôs list. It took many years for Death to clear them all until it eventually reached her again‚Äîby then, she had built a family, and now all of her descendants are doomed to die because of her past interference in Death‚Äôs plans.

Nick did the exact same thing. He had a premonition of the movie theater plus the shopping mall getting absolutely fucked up, saving not only Lori and Janet but also a whole bunch of other people, meaning those new survivors should, in theory, be put on another list. However, Nick‚Äôs hypothesis at the very end of the movie: ‚ÄúWhat if we didn‚Äôt change anything? What if us being here, right now, was the plan from the beginning?‚Äù implies they were powerless to alter their fates and that Death had everything planned from the start. 

Whether this ‚Äústart‚Äù refers to their post-speedway survival or even earlier than that is debatable, but, unlike FD6‚Äôs scenario where Death really intends to give chase to everyone directly and indirectly involved with that building, I have a few reasons to believe that here, despite the controversies, there‚Äôs a small possibility that Death never actually intended to kill those people at the movie theater/mall. Instead, it used the disaster as a detour to get Janet, Lori, and Nick to their true final destination, pun intended. I saw someone else‚Äôs post in here some time ago saying how FD6‚Äôs synopsis leaves a hole in FD4‚Äôs plot so I wanted to share my own thoughts with y‚Äôall since I feel this specific topic could use a little more depth despite its sloppy circumstances. Aight let‚Äôs go.

1: Janet is the first targeted in the premonition. 

Just before the mall, she was skipped at the car wash thanks to Lori‚Äôs intervention. This means Death temporarily let her go to focus on the others and would only return to her if the list circled back. However, the moment the cinema screen explodes in the premonition, a metal beam is sent directly toward her, when, in theory, it should have been aimed at Lori, who was sitting right next to her before leaving with Nick. Since the latter was no longer there when the explosion happened, Janet might have been repositioned as the starting point for the kills. Still, Death returned to her sooner than expected.

2: Nick doesn‚Äôt die in the premonition. 

Unlike FD3‚Äôs second premonition at the subway, where Wendy sees everyone die, including herself, Nick simply wakes up from his second premonition right after failing to save Lori at the escalator. This is strange because, as this movie‚Äôs visionary, he plays a major role in disrupting Death‚Äôs plans with the recurring and unexplained psychic premonitions and visions we‚Äôve seen so far in the franchise with the other visionaries. You‚Äôd think Death would resent him the most. Had the mall actually been destroyed in real life, Nick would have been the sole survivor of the trio to walk out unscathed (although covered in blood). Maybe Death had other plans specifically for him. Still, the perfect opportunity to take out all three at once was right there, and it missed.

3: Death strikes back too quickly, and still targets Janet first.

FD6‚Äôs synopsis states that Death took years to return for the woman who prevented the tower/building collapse. In FD4, however, Death returns only two weeks after Nick prevents the mall disaster, killing off the trio at the coffee shop with that single truck. Now, you could argue that a skyscraper or a high-rise has a larger capacity than a shopping mall, depending on its size and design, but that‚Äôs a professional field I don‚Äôt know shit about. The only reasonable explanation is that Death mass genocided all the mall survivors within the span of two weeks before coming back for the main three. That is, if it actually targeted those other survivors at all, since the real question here is whether the movie theater/mall disaster was meant to be prevented or not. As for Janet, she is once again the first one targeted, this time crushed by the truck‚Äôs wheel. In theory, Nick should have been the first to die, since by saving them at the mall, Death had skipped both Janet and Lori‚Äôs turns. The only possible way within FD standards is that the trio had been unknowingly saving each other off-screen multiple times, causing the list to eventually circle back to Janet. This would be similar to how Alex and Clear kept saving each other off-screen between FD1 and FD2, until Death finally got Alex for good.

Now here comes the potential counterpoints and further considerations:

1: Nick created a new list

If we go with the most probable possibility and assume that Nick‚Äôs second premonition was not a false alarm and his actions actually reseted Death‚Äôs original list, then him, Lori and Janet would still be doomed to die, but now Death would have operated under a brand new list that included all the other mall survivors plus the remaining three from the speedway. However in this case:

- Why did Death allow Nick to stop the disaster? If Nick was interfering with fate, Death should have accelerated the process, not let him stop it;
- The franchise consistently showed that Death doesn‚Äôt let people escape, it adapts. So how would Nick ‚Äúrestarting‚Äù the list even work?

2: The other mall survivors 

If Nick truly placed those other people in this new list, then Death should have had to go after all them just like it did in the other movies whenever people cheat their designed fates. FD6 is suggesting that when someone disrupts a large-scale catastrophe, Death takes years to clean up the mess left behind. Yet in FD4, Death seemed to return almost instantly for Nick, Lori, and Janet, implying one of two things: 

- Death did indeed wipe out all the previous mall survivors off-screen in just two weeks, which is a bit outta character for Death considering how methodical it usually is;
- This disaster was never supposed to happen in the first place, meaning those other people were never really marked, supporting the first possibility that it was all a misdirection

3: Was the mall disaster really just a setup to get the trio to their real deaths?

This I what I personally believe in and that would also align with how in the other movies, survivors‚Äô attempts to cheat death often lead them to more convoluted or ironic ends. But:

- If Nick changed the event, preventing multiple deaths, why did Death, once again, allow it? Was stopping the mall disaster always part of Death‚Äôs plan? If so, what was even the point of Nick having that premonition?
- If the coffee shop was always their final stop, then the mall disaster was just an unnecessary delay. It breaks the logic of the franchise, unless the producers officially confirm that the mall was always meant to be a feint or a distraction, which I doubt that‚Äôll be happening in the near future 

4: Death‚Äôs ‚Äúplan from the beginning‚Äù and what it could mean

Nick‚Äôs final line can have different interpretations: 

- Death orchestrated everything from the speedway disaster onward, ensuring the last few survivors ended up at the coffee shop;
- The mall premonition was never about stopping deaths but simply pushing them toward their real dead end; 
- A vague attempt at wrapping up a weak script with pseudo-philosophical dialogue, which leads us to the final and most down-to-earth point:

5: It‚Äôs all just a load of bullshit 

FD4 is universally agreed upon being the worst movie in the franchise for many reasons, including weak writing and inconsistencies, so maybe this whole thing with the movie theater/mall shouldn‚Äôt be overthought much (despite my incessant enthusiasm and curiosity to literally everything related to this damn franchise). With FD4‚Äôs script having been rushed due to the 2007-2008 writer‚Äôs strike, they probably didn‚Äôt have enough time to actually develop something truly insightful and just went with whatever all the way, without properly thinking about whether their ideas would fit or not Death‚Äôs established patterns, leaving many fans, like me, on their own to try and put the few available pieces together. 

Two very last things I want to mention is that, for one, despite all the issues this disaster has in premonition and would have in real life, the mall is still up and thriving within the FD universe solely because of Nick‚Äôs actions alone, and that managed to get him some fame as we saw with the homeless man recognizing him at the coffee shop. Since all the five movies are confirmed to be referenced and canonized in FD6, it would be quite interesting if the main girl ended up finding out about Nick online since he and her grandma, which happens to be the 60s woman, have similar cases of both having successfully stopped disasters from happening in the past, even if he‚Äôs 6ft below the ground now. 

The last thing is that FD4, thanks to Nick‚Äôs final quote, is the only movie in the franchise so far to suggest that Death is the one who actually sends the premonitions to the visionaries and that almost every action the characters take in their lives is completely predetermined, meaning every time they think they‚Äôre getting away from Death, they‚Äôre only getting closer to it. This concept might distance itself a bit from the tone of the other movies since it undermines the sense of free will that has been a core part of them where survivors could sometimes manipulate their fate or try to cheat Death either temporarily or permanently, but imo I think that if properly developed and executed, it can definitely be one hell of a theme to explore further in the franchise.

1j4jwkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/online_sellers/comments/1j4jwkv/the_secret_sauce_to_writing_product_descriptions/,The Secret Sauce to Writing Product Descriptions That Sell,"# The Secret Sauce to Writing Product Descriptions That Sell  

If you're struggling with low conversions despite having great products, your **product descriptions** might be the culprit. A well-crafted description doesn't just *describe* your product‚Äîit *sells* it. Here's how to write descriptions that turn browsers into buyers!  

---

## **1. Know Your Target Customer**  
Before you even start writing, ask yourself:  
- Who is my ideal buyer?  
- What problem does my product solve for them?  
- What emotions do they feel when they see my product?  

Use this understanding to shape your tone and messaging. Are you selling luxury jewelry? Your tone should be **elegant and sophisticated**. Selling quirky handmade mugs? A **playful and fun** tone might be better.  

---

## **2. Focus on Benefits, Not Just Features**  
**Features** tell what the product is.  
**Benefits** tell why the customer should care.  

üí° **Example:** Instead of just saying *""This candle is made with soy wax,""* say:  
‚úÖ *""Made with all-natural soy wax for a cleaner, longer-lasting burn‚Äîperfect for creating a cozy atmosphere without harmful toxins.""*  

**Frame your product as the solution to a problem or a way to enhance their life.**  

---

## **3. Use Engaging, Sensory Words**  
Make your descriptions come alive by appealing to the senses.  

**Instead of:**  
‚ùå ""This handmade soap smells good.""  

**Try:**  
‚úÖ ""Infused with refreshing citrus and calming lavender, this handcrafted soap awakens your senses while leaving your skin feeling silky smooth.""  

This helps the customer *visualize* and *experience* the product before they even buy it.  

---

## **4. Make It Skimmable**  
Most buyers skim descriptions, so structure your text for **easy reading**:  
‚úîÔ∏è Use bullet points for key features  
‚úîÔ∏è Break text into short paragraphs  
‚úîÔ∏è Highlight important benefits in bold  

üí° **Example Format:**  
**üåø Handmade Organic Face Cream**  
- **Hydrating & Nourishing:** Packed with aloe vera and shea butter for deep moisture  
- **All-Natural Ingredients:** No parabens, sulfates, or artificial fragrances  
- **Eco-Friendly Packaging:** 100% recyclable jar to reduce waste  

Quick, easy to digest, and highlights the selling points!  

---

## **5. Add Social Proof & Storytelling**  
If possible, include:  
- A short *brand story* or *inspiration* behind the product  
- Mentions of *customer testimonials* or *reviews*  
- Details on how the product is *handmade, sustainable, or ethically sourced*  

Example:  
*""Inspired by my grandmother‚Äôs garden, this herbal tea blend combines hand-picked chamomile and fresh mint, just like she used to make. Thousands of happy customers swear by it for a perfect night‚Äôs sleep!""*  

A little storytelling makes your product feel **authentic and desirable**.  

---

## **6. Include a Call-to-Action (CTA)**  
Don‚Äôt leave the customer wondering what to do next. Encourage action!  

‚úÖ ""Add this cozy handmade scarf to your cart and stay warm in style!""  
‚úÖ ""Click 'Buy Now' to bring home this one-of-a-kind artwork today!""  

A simple **nudge** can make a big difference in conversions.  

---

## **7. Optimize for SEO**  
If you're selling on **Etsy, Amazon, or Shopify**, you want your listing to show up in searches.  

**Where to include keywords:**  
‚úîÔ∏è Title  
‚úîÔ∏è First sentence of your description  
‚úîÔ∏è Bullet points or key features  
‚úîÔ∏è Tags & backend keywords  

üí° **Example:** Instead of *""Beautiful Handmade Mug,""* use **""Rustic Handmade Ceramic Coffee Mug ‚Äì Pottery Tea Cup Gift""**  

This improves your chances of **appearing in search results!**  

---

## **Final Thoughts**  
A compelling product description isn‚Äôt just *words*‚Äîit‚Äôs **marketing in action**. By focusing on benefits, using engaging language, structuring for readability, and optimizing for SEO, you‚Äôll increase your chances of **turning visitors into buyers**.

But basically my (21m) coworker has been being lowkey weird to me (18f) since December.

He gives me hugs when I come in and before I leave. He would buy me coffees and nobody else. He was always saying he missed me when I wasn't there and that be was gonna work by/near me so he could ""bother me"". I was upset at work the other day over a customer and he asked me if I wanted a hug, I said no, and he gave me one anyway. To be honest he has toned it down recently because I think he knows I was telling my other coworkers about it. I didn't want to do or say anything for a while because I thought he was just being friendly or something and my other coworker said that was just his personality. 

Anyway. I was talking to my coworkers (who only know Spanish) and they mentioned that the other coworker (who also knows Spanish) told them I liked girls. So obviously I'm like wtf are you talking about. And then one of my coworkers speaks into a translator and shows me this. 

Anyway I don't really know what to do now. He has a girlfriend who just had a baby last month. I also have a girlfriend who now lnkws about thus. I was telling my coworkers I was thinking about telling her this but they were telling me to just leave it alone and mind my business. Am I overreacting??? Should I just leave it alone? Idk

1j4jegy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRavensDream/comments/1j4jegy/crazy_night_shiftwork_stories_pizza_purgatory/,Crazy Night Shift/Work Stories - Pizza Purgatory,"Hey Raven, hope all is going well with your voice. Thank you for including my crazy stories in your recent posts, it is truly an honor to have you reading them and sharing them with the world and you have the perfect reading style to really bring to life the crazy stories people share. 

This story took place actually a couple of weeks back during one of your Liminal Streams when I tuned in at work, but honestly crazy things kinda took place all that week leading up to that Saturday night, and a bit the Sunday after.

I work at a pizza place part time, which I'll refer to as Emperor's Pizza since the situations I'm about to share have made it up to the corporate level of the actual company. Our Emperor's Pizza location is on a strip shopping center connected to a gas station, and we share the shopping strip with a donut place, and the gas station convenience store. For the past few months, there has been a constant issue with the new manager of the donut shop having a vendetta against my manager at Emperor's Pizza, because my manager had recently broken up with an abusive and drug addict ex-boyfriend, who was also the donut shop manager's brother. 

The donut shop manager we'll call Jenny since she's vindictive and might retaliate against my boss again if she ever heard her name mentioned. She's that crazy.

Jenny began making it hard on my boss first by telling her employees to berate and refuse service to my boss, and eventually she ramped things up and began having her employees question and then rudely refuse service to people they suspected as friends, family or even fellow coworkers of my boss because Jenny had a problem with her--all of which is illegal in many ways. 
Eventually corporate management caught on since our pizza place and the donut shop were owned by the same company, and at the time of this story, they'd gotten involved. I myself also was mistreated when I went into the donut shop with my wife for coffee, and haven't been back since, and our management told us we would be fired for escalating the situation if we went over to the donut shop for anything. It actually got that bad because it turns out the regional manager for the donut shop had a personal relationship against company regulations with Jenny...if you catch my drift...and his job was on the line if he didn't come to her aid even though she was in the wrong with the whole situation. The manager was stuck doing whatever Jenny wanted, and she was set on raising hell and getting my boss fired, so here we are. The backstory helps give some clarity to what actually goes on at my job, leading up to the day I caught Raven's Saturday stream on YouTube for Liminal Space. 

Monday, we dealt with someone reporting our pizza place for having bad ingredients and making them sick, which prompted an inspection from corporate, which we passed easily because it wasn't true.

Tuesday I was off work, but I was told that a customer had been sent over to Emperor's Pizza to purposely raise hell about a wrong order, and later on my boss found out that the customer was actually a friend of Jenny's.

Wednesday, someone unidentified was caught on camera overnight, and had blocked up our dumpster door with trash. That investigation is still underway but it was very convenient how only our dumpster was blocked up and not the other two. 

Thursday I was off again but we received a handful of random bad reviews online which prompted an investigation by corporate, who pulled camera footage, transaction receipts and tried to verify the bad reviews only to find that all of the recent reviews were fake.

Friday, we dealt with someone in a dark hooded sweatshirt hanging around our building before we opened and then they left and came back hours later and hung out behind our building until we called the cops. The cops didn't see anyone or catch anyone.

Saturday...Saturday was the day it all really went down. It was evening time, around 7 p.m., and I was making dough as usual and had just tuned in to the Liminal Stream that Raven was hosting on YouTube, and not long after it started, I heard shouting and yelling up front. A man had come in frantic, bleeding and bruised pretty badly on his face and arms and asked us to please call him an ambulance. From what my boss told me, the man who came in for help, who we will call John, was a regular customer, and had been one for a few weeks. John said that there was a guy in a dark hooded sweatshirt walking around the gas station lot, and the surrounding sidewalk with a baseball bat. He saw John walking up, and without warning, the bat wielding man chased him down and began beating John with the bat as John tried to flee. Once he got away, John ran to us for help but the man with the bat got away. 
The odd thing was that the baseball bat man didn't say anything or try to rob John, he just launched a full on assault and started beating him. We did call an ambulance and a dozen police were on site within a few minutes. John was taken to the hospital, and the officers took statements and camera footage from our store and the gas station, as well as the donut shop on an attempt to find out more about the attack, and see if they could see where the baseball bat man came from or went after the attack. They also left a police car at our store, and had a couple of units rolling around the building and the surrounding neighborhoods on patrols, before the officer up front came in to update us on their ""BOLO"" for a man in a hooded sweatshirt running around with a baseball bat. They hadn't found him, but in addition to the report of the hooded sweatshirt man hanging around our store on Friday, apparently there was an earlier incident that same Saturday at a fast food place a few miles up the road where the police were called on a man matching the same description, who apparently had a fight with an employee, left, and came back to burst one of their front windows with ""something"", and ran off. There's a lot of woods and some large neighborhoods that connect to various roads and such in our area, so it wouldn't be hard for a guy like this to disappear, which is probably why the police seemed like they couldn't catch him.

A few hours after John left in the ambulance, and the officer stationed up front left as well, one of my coworkers was working to resolve an issue with a customer who was insisting that their pizza was cold even though it was ordered online, and had just come out of the oven when the customer came in. The customer ended up throwing the pizza at my coworker, and thankfully missed, since an oven-fresh pizza with cheese, pepperoni and scolding-hot pizza sauce can cause all kinds of burns. We called corporate again, and unfortunately there wasn't much that could be done except for my boss to tell her they would document the incident and keep an eye out for another negative review. By this point I was ready to go home, and honestly apart from being tuned into the Liminal Stream, I was irritated. I ended up being at work til around 12 a.m. making extra dough for Sunday since I wasn't scheduled to work, and my wife came to pick me up from work once I was done. 

Sunday was uneventful, but Sunday night was crazy. My wife went to the gym in our apartment complex with her sister and I originally decided to stay home. I kept hearing sirens outside shortly after she left, and I began feeling weird, so I checked in with the community group for our complex to see if anyone knew what was going on. A few posts were cracking jokes about it, but those posts were silenced after someone said that the police were combing the area for an unmarked white van with a shooting suspect that had just fled the scene of a shooting. I got up, got dressed and texted my wife that I was coming to join her at the gym so she wouldn't have to walk home alone after her sister left, and while I was texting her, I heard the roar of a helicopter overhead. I walked up to the front of the complex, seeing police cars everywhere on the streets, cutting through our complex, and converging in the empty parking lot of the department store just outside of our complex. A life flight helicopter landed there, and I took out my phone and immediately started filming as I walked up. I shared the footage of the scene there with the community group, and a few minutes later, I got a private message from one of the community group members who told me the story of what was happening. Apparently, her source was one of the officers involved--her husband. 

Apparently witnesses said that a man in a dark hooded sweatshirt was seen trying to get into one of the unmarked work vans parked at the edge of our parking lot. Someone inside the van opened the rear door during his attempt, shot him several times, and then the van took off. Police were looking everywhere for the van, and since the sweatshirt man was in critical condition, they were bringing him to the department store parking lot to transfer him to a life flight, which apparently this department store lot was used as a waypoint for life flights since it was flat, open and easier to land in. 

As I read the messages, I couldn't help wondering if this was the same man that beat John with the baseball bat, and had been hanging out around the Emperor's Pizza before, since the description was almost the same and the officers never caught the guy after what he did. The whole situation became unsettling, and after the life flight left, I headed to the gym at the front of our apartment complex and met up with my wife to tell her what happened.

The whole situation is crazy, and I apologize for how long it is. Nothing else has happened since then, except the donut shop manager Jenny starting a rumor that someone was rushed to the hospital after we served them bad pizza and that's why the ambulance was there that Saturday. I hear she's actually about to be fired. Good riddance.

By the way, if you haven't already, definitely check out the community nights and streams Raven hosts. They're really fun and definitely worth it.

A soft golden sunrise shines through an open window as a beautiful symphony of chirping birds act as my alarm clock. My eyes slowly open as the sweet smell of freshly brewed coffee calls me out of bed. Pulling my sweatpants on, I head for the bedroom door. The t.v. quietly plays an episode of a dance competition my wife loves so much. ‚ÄúGood morning honey‚Äù my voice soft, but husky, forcing out the first words after a good sleep.



‚ÄúHey babe, want a cup?‚Äù Her melodic voice asks as Katherine walks towards me, already carrying my filled cup of medium roast.¬†



‚ÄúYea, put it on the table? I'll join you in just a second.‚Äù I turn towards the bathroom, still talking as I head towards it. ‚ÄúThe Jabbas didn't get kicked right?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, you didn't miss much, don't worry.‚Äù She responds with a chuckle.



¬†After flushing I reach for The brush sitting alone in the holder. Wait, I must still be tired. I better splash some water on my face. Ahh, that cold sensation feels good on my skin, a great way to fully wake up! Grabbing my green toothbrush sitting next to her pink one, I quickly clean my teeth.¬†



After sitting on the couch next to Katherine I reach for my, ‚ÄúWhere's my coffee?‚Äù I ask, confused.



‚ÄúOh sorry, I forgot to make some.‚Äù But I can still smell the coffee lingering in the air.



‚ÄúIt's alright,‚Äù I sigh. ‚ÄúI'll make some, you want a cup?‚Äù Standing from the couch I walk towards the kitchen, waiting for a reply that never comes. Shrugging it off I continue as I slap a pod into the keurig. ‚ÄúWell, any plans for today?‚Äù



‚ÄúNothing planned so far, I was hoping we could have a lazy day?‚Äù Her soft, carmel eyes connect with mine as I smile in response.



‚ÄúSure, I should go pull the cans in then.‚Äù It was trash day after all, I stand up and turn towards the door to see a suitcase next to it. When was the last time we used that thing? Months ago I think,¬† when we went to Vegas.¬†



I was just going to ask about it before she cut my thoughts off with, ‚ÄúI already grabbed them, let's just get comfy.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúSure yea, hey why is the suitcase out?‚Äù I ask, I'm sure with a puzzled face.



Katherine turned towards where I was pointing. ‚ÄúThe what babe?‚Äù As I turned to reiterate, I noticed there was nothing by the door, besides the table we use to place our keys on. Something feels‚Ä¶ off. Maybe I'm getting sick, a lazy day would be perfect. My legs kick up onto the ottoman as I slip into a comfy position, my hand resting on her leg. The t.v. showing an advertisement for, something. I can't make out what it's trying to sell, it's just an image of a serpent eating its own tail. ‚ÄúThe what babe?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat? Oh, nothing sorry.‚Äù I respond, but why was her tone the exact same? ‚ÄúAre you alright bunny?‚Äù I look towards her as I ask but I jump in fear. Shocked at the twisted amalgamation of what should be my wifes beautiful face. Or, my ex wife. That's right, she left months ago.



A harsh, red glow of a morning sunrise paints the room. I sit up, groggy and confused. What a strange dream. Why would that have‚Ä¶ my thoughts cut off by an angry voice, ‚ÄúWake the fuck up! We're supposed to be in the car already!‚Äù Katherines harpy like tone cuts into my ears.



That's right, we're supposed to go to her parents today. fuck i don't want to. My head is splitting from a hangover, but I better get up. Throwing the blanket off of my sweat drenched body, I stand up. ‚ÄúGive me a bit, shit. I gotta take a‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúYou're always late when I ask for things. I told you not to go out last night Keith. I fuckin told you!‚Äù



‚ÄúMaybe if you didn't fuckin nag me all day I wouldn't feel like I had to get away from you! Just let me shower and we'll get going.‚Äù I shouldn't have said that, but we are already here. I try to rush into the bathroom but she's right there. Right in the doorway.



‚ÄúI what?‚Äù Her voice is even louder now, but somehow seems like it's far away. ‚ÄúI fuckin nag? Maybe if you acted like a fuckin man I wouldn't be‚Ä¶‚Äù



My face flushed red with anger. ‚ÄúA fuckin man? You want to see a fuckin man?‚Äù my hand balled up into a fist. I need to step away, I need fresh air. She flung into the floor, her pendent of a serpent eating its own tail still clutched in my hand. Did I do that? No way, I would never do that. I can't believe I just. I slammed the door, locking it, closing myself into the bathroom. Loud bangs echoed against the porcelain. Her wailing cries bouncing around the room, matching my own angry screams masking fear. I turn to yell at myself in the mirror when I realized, it was, smiling? Grinning wildly back at me before shattering, falling around me like a world crumbling away.¬†



A blinding white sun shines through the floor to ceiling window of what was once our favorite cafe. Sitting across from me was a beautiful young woman with sorrow in her eyes. ‚ÄúKatherine, I'm‚Ä¶ I'm so sorry, please forgive me?‚Äù I plead only met with a silent glare. I look down in thought, choosing My next words carefully. I notice the cafe logo on the cup, a snake devouring itself with words printed around it. ‚ÄòOroboros coffee since 2014.‚Äô Wait no, that's not right. I blink and see the actual logo, a cerberus with ‚Äòthree headed bean roasters‚Äô written under it. What is happening?



‚ÄúIs that all you wanted to say?‚Äù Her cold voice breaks my silence.



‚ÄúNo I‚Ä¶ give me one more chance? Please?‚Äù The tone of begging covering my unsteady voice.



‚ÄúHow many chances do you think I can give you Keith?‚Äù frustration hanging in the air from her words.



‚ÄúI can change, I can‚Ä¶ I'll stop drinking. I would do anything for you, for us! Whatever it takes, I p-promise.‚Äù That last word almost stuttered out past my lips.



‚ÄúYou've said that before. I don't believe it this time.‚Äù After a slight pause, her lips move, forming words but the voice comes almost a full second late. ‚ÄúI can't trust you‚Äù that notion stung like daggers piercing my soul, but they were true. How could she trust me? I barely trust myself. I reach forward to grab her warm, soft hands but, they aren't there, only an empty space where they should be. Her arms end at the wrist. That emptiness begins to trail slowly upwards, engulfing her. She's disappearing right in front of me.



‚ÄúNo, no, no. Please don't go!‚Äù I beg. ‚ÄúPlease, don't do this to me!‚Äù But before I get the full sentence out, she's gone.¬†



‚ÄúSir?‚Äù a calm barista calls out from next to me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been here a while, i think it's time to‚Ä¶‚Äù the final words don't come from the soft spoken barista. Her lips move but the voice, it's mine. But, not just mine, Katherines too. Both echoing against each other unnaturally as the cafe begins to crack and fall apart around me. ‚ÄúMove on.‚Äù Everything is‚Ä¶ gone, replaced by that blinding white.



Heavy rain pelts through ominously dark skies, splattering against my cracked window. How long i stared at it, i'm unsure. A phone call stirs me from the near slumber just enough to get me to turn away from the window. Glass tings against the hardwood floor. Shit, i fell asleep with the bottle again. Standing up, my legs wobble like a newborn deer. I reach down and grab the bottle, a quarter way full of golden brown whiskey, the phone call still coming through. I take a large gulp of the sweet liquid and look towards my phone. How is it still vibrating like that, dancing along the wood grain top of my nightstand. Left, right, left, right. Looking at the contact info i see its Jacob, my one true friend in this world. No doubt calling to check up on me, but i don't want to answer. No, i don't want to talk right now. I take another long pull from the bottle, letting the warmth pass down my chest, burning as it goes, the only warmth I've felt in a while. Looking down i see where some of the whiskey spilled out, making a circle on the floor. It almost looks like a snake? Like its biting itself. More whiskey fills my mouth, i didn't drink that. At least i didn't mean too. I should get out of here, but there's nothing out there for me, not anymore. My head rocks back, looking up to the heavens and my mouth fills again, stinging my lips and tongue with a hint of honey. I know i didnt raise the bottle that time. Fuck, i dont want to be here. I just want to‚Ä¶ i stumble backwards, falling onto the broken, hard mattress.



Bright, warm sunlight filters through wispy clouds. Beautiful laughter and happy conversations happening all around me as the smell of freshly made sweets fill the air. A warm, loving sensation sits in my hand. Katherines fingers intertwined with my own as she pulls to get my attention. ‚ÄúBabe! They have the churros I like! Can we get one, please?‚Äù



‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù i respond, gesturing towards the food stall with a souvenir cup in my hand, filled with a blue mixed drink. ‚ÄúLet's go get a couple.‚Äù We start walking through the crowd as I take a sip of, straight whiskey? Huh, they must not have added enough mixers. ‚ÄúOh babe.‚Äù I say as we wait in line, raising my empty hand to point out my favorite ride. ‚ÄúCan we go on the serpents kiss after this?‚Äù Looking at the ride from this angle, the loops perfectly match up, resembling a serpent not just chasing its own tail, but eating it. I expect her to say no, because of the loops the ride has.¬†



‚ÄúYou know it makes me queasy, but ill make you a deal? I pick the next ride ok?‚Äù she responds.



‚ÄúIt's not gonna be that boring tunnel ride is it?‚Äù I tease.



‚ÄúCome on! It's not boring, it's relaxing. And we can make out in the neon lights!‚Äù she pesters. The thought of that warm embrace does sound nice in this chaotic theme park.¬†



‚ÄúYou got yourself a deal then.‚Äù we walk towards the queue while snacking on the churros. We get in line, still far from the actual entrance. I look at the people ahead of us and see, Katherine, kissing someone else. But she's, who‚Äôs hand am I holding? I turn to my left to see Katherine looking up at me. Voices all around me become louder and louder. A cacophony of sounds with only a few legible words. ‚ÄúFailure. Cheat. Loser. Asshole. Narcissist.‚Äù¬†



¬†She places her gentle hands on my face. ‚ÄúBabe look at me. You‚Äôre having a panic attack again. Just look at me for a second, look into my eyes.‚Äù I do as she says and stare deep into her caramel brown eyes, feeling a sense of calm wash over me. The voices quiet down before completely disappearing altogether. ‚ÄúIt's just me and you.‚Äù She was right. I looked around to see, nobody. Nobody around us at all, just emptiness and silence. ‚ÄúLets get on the ride ok?‚Äù



‚ÄúYea. lets go‚Äù i don't understand what is happening, but maybe the ride will distract me enough. We walk to the end of the queue and there's a full roller coaster cart of people, with just two seats left in the front car. Katherine pulls me to it, and we hop in. the shoulder restraints coming down and locking us in.



From my left side I hear the ride operator say ‚Äúenjoy your stay.‚Äù What an odd thing to say. Before I get a chance to ask what he meant the coaster starts ticking forward, slowly pulling itself up the steep incline. As it makes it to the top, it slows, tension building in me before the drop. The ride lurches forward, picking up speed insanely fast as it plummets towards the ground. The track goes up, and down, and up, and down, more chaotically than I've ever felt it before. What is happening? I go to place my hand on Katherines leg to comfort her but, she's‚Ä¶ not there? I turn to see an empty space next to me. Turning farther I see the entire coaster is empty and then‚Ä¶ slam. I hit the side of the cart as it banks and sets up for the loops. One loop, two loops, and then it twists. Looping me uncontrollably, somehow in all directions at once. ‚ÄúGet me off of this thing!‚Äù I yell, but there's nobody to hear it. I need to get off of this, my vision is starting to fade.



Light casts unwavering, unchanging shadows around the hotel room as I wake up. Getting out of bed I look out the high up window. The theme park is clearly visible a short way down the road. But it's so quiet. No cheerful voices, no hum of rides being operated, no‚Ä¶ nothing. There isn't even movement. It's like a bizarre painting, imitating what should be there. I remember this room, but it seems off. It's where we always stay when we visit this park. But, there is something wrong. No gentle hums from the hotels amenities, no noises from other guests, nothing at all but an eerie silence. There's a directory on the nightstand, maybe that will tell me something. Neatly printed on the front cover is ‚Äòenjoy your stay at the Ouroboros inn.‚Äô that's not right, it's supposed to be the, uh. I can't remember what the name of this place is, but it's not that. Upon opening it I'm greeted by blank white pages. I need to get out of here.



I step out into the hallway and the door clicks closed behind me. But which way should i go? Which way is the exit? I can't tell, so i'll just go‚Ä¶ this way. I walk down the hall for a while before a door opens to my right. Peering in, I see, a pizza parlor? Wait, that's me. I'm there, down on one knee, holding up a vibrantly pink morganite stone resting in a sparkling rose gold engagement ring. I remember that day as the happiest day of my life. The day she said yes. But, I don't want to see that now. It no longer brings me joy, only pain. Shaking my head I begin to walk further down the hallway.¬†



Minutes pass before another door opens, the smell of crisp ocean air pours out. Seagulls calling in the distance as I glance around. It's a harbor, a pier full of people dressed up. Down the center, a beautiful and elegant‚Ä¶ Katherine walks towards me. Her deep red wedding dress caressing her body. I don't want to see this, not again. I have to walk away before she makes it to me.



Even farther down the hall another door opens. Why am I so curious? I approach and glance in to see Katherine and I holding outstretched hands, staring into each others eyes. I blink and it's‚Ä¶ not me there. I'm replaced by a childhood friend as they lean in for a kiss. Another blink and it's my own brother stepping back from the kiss. Suddenly their necks contort, snapping, forcing them to look at me with wild toothy grins. They're‚Ä¶ laughing at me, mocking me. It grows louder, more voices added to the mix. Now from all around me, overwhelming, like the entire hotel is just laughing at me. I can't be here. Please make it stop! I start running down the corridor faster and faster, searching for an exit. But the faster I run the louder the sounds become and the farther away the end of the hallway gets. I have to wake up. I NEED to wake up. Please!¬†



A blinding white light jars me from spacing out on the streets in front of a once beloved cafe. How long was I looking out the window? I turn to see the clock on the wall framed by a mermaid. Or is that a siren? The one with sharp teeth. Either way, it's biting its own tail, blood dripping from it over the clock face becoming the minute hand. Why can't I tell the time? ‚ÄúKeith, I'm sorry.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I look across the table to see a tearful woman gazing longingly at me. ‚ÄúKatherine, we've been over this.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know, I know. But please listen?‚Äù she pleads.



I respond coldly, ‚Äúfine. What is it this time?‚Äù¬†



Her sorrowful voice continues, ‚ÄúI'm so sorry, i didn't mean to‚Ä¶‚Äù



I cut her off with, ‚ÄúDidn't mean to? Several times?‚Äù



‚ÄúI didn't mean to hurt you,‚Äù she snaps. ‚ÄúPlease take me back? I will do anything. I'll delete his number.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhose number?‚Äù I know the answer, but I need her to say it.



‚ÄúI'll delete Kevins number. I'll never talk to him again. Please just forgive me.‚Äù The tears pour down her cheek but I must remain strong.¬†



‚ÄúI don't think I can do that Katherine.‚Äù shaking my head, I reach down and grab the coffee mug, taking a long sip of‚Ä¶ whiskey? How would the cafe give me that? Was it an accident?



‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù she begs some more. ‚ÄúI'll do anything for you, anything for us. Just trust me.‚Äù



A deep sigh escapes my lips. ‚ÄúTrust you? I‚Ä¶ I can't trust you, not anymore. But there is something you can do for me. Alright?‚Äù



Her voice perks up for a moment, ‚Äúanything, what is it?‚Äù



‚ÄúTake care of yourself. Find someone new, and grow with them. I want you to‚Ä¶‚Äù these final words. I know the air comes from my mouth, and my lips form the words but, it's not my voice. Well, not only my voice. It's both of our voices, simultaneous and unnatural, ‚Äúmove on.‚Äù Everything disappears only to be left with a blinding white light and gentle sobs.



I bolt upright out of a deep sleep, coated in sweat. A soft golden sunrise shines through an open window as birds chirp in the distance and the smell of freshly brewed coffee calls me out of bed. that's right, I put it on a schedule. I stand up out of bed and grab my phone, seeing a new voicemail from Jacob.¬†



‚ÄúHey buddy, we're going fishing today right? I got the boat ready and I grabbed a twelve pack‚Äù his jovial voice leaves my phone speaker. But this asshole got a twelve pack? He knows I haven't drank in months. His voice cuts through the silence, ‚Äúof that canned water you love so much,‚Äù followed by a chuckle. I smirk, this guy knows how to get me. I should call him back, but first coffee.¬†



In the kitchen I grab the souvenir cup I got back when I was with Katherine off of the stand of the coffee maker. I remember that day, it was one of the good ones. We had just gotten off of the serpents kiss and stopped at the small photo shack. They sold mugs, and I wanted a way for me to remember. That first sip of delicious medium roast coffee touches my lips, causing me to smile as I head towards the bathroom. After a quick shower, I put on a fresh set of clothes and grab my phone. Jacob should be here any minute now.¬†



A short drive to the lake and were hopping out, laughing about shared memories and unpacking the fishing gear. Pushing the boat down the loading dock I see a cat in the distance, chasing its own tail. No, it's not chasing it, its teeth are clenched around the matted fur as it spins rapidly around. Jacobs' hoarse voice catches my attention, ‚Äúhey there space cadet, you ready?‚Äù



‚ÄúYea,‚Äù I chuckle. ‚ÄúLet's get to it.‚Äù with that we set off, in no time at all finding a good spot to anchor down and cast our lines.



‚ÄúYou see a bit off. Everything alright?‚Äù He questions, breaking a short silence as we wait for fish to bite.



‚ÄúYea, i've just been having some strange dreams.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat about?‚Äù he sounds genuinely concerned. ‚ÄúIs it her again?‚Äù



‚ÄúYea, i thought i was over it, you know? It's been years after all. I hear she's with someone else and they have a kid together.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow does that make you feel bud?‚Äù



‚ÄúGood. I'm honestly happy she was able to move on and heal. She wasn't a bad person, it just‚Ä¶ wasn't the right time I guess,‚Äù my words trail off as I stare into the horizon.



‚ÄúYou don't want her back do you?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúOh God no. i don't mean to sound rude but, that's just not even a possibility in my head. I'm just saying im glad her life is getting better. I think we had both learned a lot, not just about ourselves, but about relationships in general.‚Äù



His tone shifts to happy and upbeat, ‚Äúthat's good man. I'm glad you see it that way, i don't know how you're so nice about it but hey, im..‚Äù¬†



Everything takes an unnatural pause, silence everywhere, before words ring out all around me. It's not in Jacobs voice, or my own. It is Katherines soft, delicate voice rolling over the water like honey. ‚ÄúI'm proud of you.‚Äù



Soft rain pelts my cracked window as I roll out of bed to get ready for another workday. I put on my pants, shoes, shirt, and my pendant of a serpent eating its own tail.

A soft golden sunrise shines through an open window as a beautiful symphony of chirping birds act as my alarm clock. My eyes slowly open as the sweet smell of freshly brewed coffee calls me out of bed. Pulling my sweatpants on, I head for the bedroom door. The t.v. quietly plays an episode of a dance competition my wife loves so much. ‚ÄúGood morning honey‚Äù my voice soft, but husky, forcing out the first words after a good sleep.



‚ÄúHey babe, want a cup?‚Äù Her melodic voice asks as Katherine walks towards me, already carrying my filled cup of medium roast.¬†



‚ÄúYea, put it on the table? I'll join you in just a second.‚Äù I turn towards the bathroom, still talking as I head towards it. ‚ÄúThe Jabbas didn't get kicked right?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, you didn't miss much, don't worry.‚Äù She responds with a chuckle.



¬†After flushing I reach for The brush sitting alone in the holder. Wait, I must still be tired. I better splash some water on my face. Ahh, that cold sensation feels good on my skin, a great way to fully wake up! Grabbing my green toothbrush sitting next to her pink one, I quickly clean my teeth.¬†



After sitting on the couch next to Katherine I reach for my, ‚ÄúWhere's my coffee?‚Äù I ask, confused.



‚ÄúOh sorry, I forgot to make some.‚Äù But I can still smell the coffee lingering in the air.



‚ÄúIt's alright,‚Äù I sigh. ‚ÄúI'll make some, you want a cup?‚Äù Standing from the couch I walk towards the kitchen, waiting for a reply that never comes. Shrugging it off I continue as I slap a pod into the keurig. ‚ÄúWell, any plans for today?‚Äù



‚ÄúNothing planned so far, I was hoping we could have a lazy day?‚Äù Her soft, carmel eyes connect with mine as I smile in response.



‚ÄúSure, I should go pull the cans in then.‚Äù It was trash day after all, I stand up and turn towards the door to see a suitcase next to it. When was the last time we used that thing? Months ago I think,¬† when we went to Vegas.¬†



I was just going to ask about it before she cut my thoughts off with, ‚ÄúI already grabbed them, let's just get comfy.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúSure yea, hey why is the suitcase out?‚Äù I ask, I'm sure with a puzzled face.



Katherine turned towards where I was pointing. ‚ÄúThe what babe?‚Äù As I turned to reiterate, I noticed there was nothing by the door, besides the table we use to place our keys on. Something feels‚Ä¶ off. Maybe I'm getting sick, a lazy day would be perfect. My legs kick up onto the ottoman as I slip into a comfy position, my hand resting on her leg. The t.v. showing an advertisement for, something. I can't make out what it's trying to sell, it's just an image of a serpent eating its own tail. ‚ÄúThe what babe?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat? Oh, nothing sorry.‚Äù I respond, but why was her tone the exact same? ‚ÄúAre you alright bunny?‚Äù I look towards her as I ask but I jump in fear. Shocked at the twisted amalgamation of what should be my wifes beautiful face. Or, my ex wife. That's right, she left months ago.



A harsh, red glow of a morning sunrise paints the room. I sit up, groggy and confused. What a strange dream. Why would that have‚Ä¶ my thoughts cut off by an angry voice, ‚ÄúWake the fuck up! We're supposed to be in the car already!‚Äù Katherines harpy like tone cuts into my ears.

Turning farther I see the entire coaster is empty and then‚Ä¶ slam. I hit the side of the cart as it banks and sets up for the loops. One loop, two loops, and then it twists. Looping me uncontrollably, somehow in all directions at once. ‚ÄúGet me off of this thing!‚Äù I yell, but there's nobody to hear it. I need to get off of this, my vision is starting to fade.



Light casts unwavering, unchanging shadows around the hotel room as I wake up. Getting out of bed I look out the high up window. The theme park is clearly visible a short way down the road. But it's so quiet. No cheerful voices, no hum of rides being operated, no‚Ä¶ nothing. There isn't even movement. It's like a bizarre painting, imitating what should be there. I remember this room, but it seems off. It's where we always stay when we visit this park. But, there is something wrong. No gentle hums from the hotels amenities, no noises from other guests, nothing at all but an eerie silence. There's a directory on the nightstand, maybe that will tell me something. Neatly printed on the front cover is ‚Äòenjoy your stay at the Ouroboros inn.‚Äô that's not right, it's supposed to be the, uh. I can't remember what the name of this place is, but it's not that. Upon opening it I'm greeted by blank white pages. I need to get out of here.



I step out into the hallway and the door clicks closed behind me. But which way should i go? Which way is the exit? I can't tell, so i'll just go‚Ä¶ this way. I walk down the hall for a while before a door opens to my right. Peering in, I see, a pizza parlor? Wait, that's me. I'm there, down on one knee, holding up a vibrantly pink morganite stone resting in a sparkling rose gold engagement ring. I remember that day as the happiest day of my life. The day she said yes. But, I don't want to see that now. It no longer brings me joy, only pain. Shaking my head I begin to walk further down the hallway.¬†



Minutes pass before another door opens, the smell of crisp ocean air pours out. Seagulls calling in the distance as I glance around. It's a harbor, a pier full of people dressed up. Down the center, a beautiful and elegant‚Ä¶ Katherine walks towards me. Her deep red wedding dress caressing her body. I don't want to see this, not again. I have to walk away before she makes it to me.



Even farther down the hall another door opens. Why am I so curious? I approach and glance in to see Katherine and I holding outstretched hands, staring into each others eyes. I blink and it's‚Ä¶ not me there. I'm replaced by a childhood friend as they lean in for a kiss. Another blink and it's my own brother stepping back from the kiss. Suddenly their necks contort, snapping, forcing them to look at me with wild toothy grins. They're‚Ä¶ laughing at me, mocking me. It grows louder, more voices added to the mix. Now from all around me, overwhelming, like the entire hotel is just laughing at me. I can't be here. Please make it stop! I start running down the corridor faster and faster, searching for an exit. But the faster I run the louder the sounds become and the farther away the end of the hallway gets. I have to wake up. I NEED to wake up. Please!¬†



A blinding white light jars me from spacing out on the streets in front of a once beloved cafe. How long was I looking out the window? I turn to see the clock on the wall framed by a mermaid. Or is that a siren? The one with sharp teeth. Either way, it's biting its own tail, blood dripping from it over the clock face becoming the minute hand. Why can't I tell the time? ‚ÄúKeith, I'm sorry.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I look across the table to see a tearful woman gazing longingly at me. ‚ÄúKatherine, we've been over this.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know, I know. But please listen?‚Äù she pleads.



I respond coldly, ‚Äúfine. What is it this time?‚Äù¬†



Her sorrowful voice continues, ‚ÄúI'm so sorry, i didn't mean to‚Ä¶‚Äù



I cut her off with, ‚ÄúDidn't mean to? Several times?‚Äù



‚ÄúI didn't mean to hurt you,‚Äù she snaps. ‚ÄúPlease take me back? I will do anything. I'll delete his number.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhose number?‚Äù I know the answer, but I need her to say it.



‚ÄúI'll delete Kevins number. I'll never talk to him again. Please just forgive me.‚Äù The tears pour down her cheek but I must remain strong.¬†



‚ÄúI don't think I can do that Katherine.‚Äù shaking my head, I reach down and grab the coffee mug, taking a long sip of‚Ä¶ whiskey? How would the cafe give me that? Was it an accident?



‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù she begs some more. ‚ÄúI'll do anything for you, anything for us. Just trust me.‚Äù



A deep sigh escapes my lips. ‚ÄúTrust you? I‚Ä¶ I can't trust you, not anymore. But there is something you can do for me. Alright?‚Äù



Her voice perks up for a moment, ‚Äúanything, what is it?‚Äù



‚ÄúTake care of yourself. Find someone new, and grow with them. I want you to‚Ä¶‚Äù these final words. I know the air comes from my mouth, and my lips form the words but, it's not my voice. Well, not only my voice. It's both of our voices, simultaneous and unnatural, ‚Äúmove on.‚Äù Everything disappears only to be left with a blinding white light and gentle sobs.



I bolt upright out of a deep sleep, coated in sweat. A soft golden sunrise shines through an open window as birds chirp in the distance and the smell of freshly brewed coffee calls me out of bed. that's right, I put it on a schedule. I stand up out of bed and grab my phone, seeing a new voicemail from Jacob.¬†



‚ÄúHey buddy, we're going fishing today right? I got the boat ready and I grabbed a twelve pack‚Äù his jovial voice leaves my phone speaker. But this asshole got a twelve pack? He knows I haven't drank in months. His voice cuts through the silence, ‚Äúof that canned water you love so much,‚Äù followed by a chuckle. I smirk, this guy knows how to get me. I should call him back, but first coffee.¬†



In the kitchen I grab the souvenir cup I got back when I was with Katherine off of the stand of the coffee maker. I remember that day, it was one of the good ones. We had just gotten off of the serpents kiss and stopped at the small photo shack. They sold mugs, and I wanted a way for me to remember. That first sip of delicious medium roast coffee touches my lips, causing me to smile as I head towards the bathroom. After a quick shower, I put on a fresh set of clothes and grab my phone. Jacob should be here any minute now.¬†



A short drive to the lake and were hopping out, laughing about shared memories and unpacking the fishing gear. Pushing the boat down the loading dock I see a cat in the distance, chasing its own tail. No, it's not chasing it, its teeth are clenched around the matted fur as it spins rapidly around. Jacobs' hoarse voice catches my attention, ‚Äúhey there space cadet, you ready?‚Äù



‚ÄúYea,‚Äù I chuckle. ‚ÄúLet's get to it.‚Äù with that we set off, in no time at all finding a good spot to anchor down and cast our lines.



‚ÄúYou see a bit off. Everything alright?‚Äù He questions, breaking a short silence as we wait for fish to bite.



‚ÄúYea, i've just been having some strange dreams.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat about?‚Äù he sounds genuinely concerned. ‚ÄúIs it her again?‚Äù



‚ÄúYea, i thought i was over it, you know? It's been years after all. I hear she's with someone else and they have a kid together.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow does that make you feel bud?‚Äù



‚ÄúGood. I'm honestly happy she was able to move on and heal. She wasn't a bad person, it just‚Ä¶ wasn't the right time I guess,‚Äù my words trail off as I stare into the horizon.



‚ÄúYou don't want her back do you?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúOh God no. i don't mean to sound rude but, that's just not even a possibility in my head. I'm just saying im glad her life is getting better. I think we had both learned a lot, not just about ourselves, but about relationships in general.‚Äù



His tone shifts to happy and upbeat, ‚Äúthat's good man. I'm glad you see it that way, i don't know how you're so nice about it but hey, im..‚Äù¬†



Everything takes an unnatural pause, silence everywhere, before words ring out all around me. It's not in Jacobs voice, or my own. It is Katherines soft, delicate voice rolling over the water like honey. ‚ÄúI'm proud of you.‚Äù



Soft rain pelts my cracked window as I roll out of bed to get ready for another workday. I put on my pants, shoes, shirt, and my pendant of a serpent eating its own tail.
