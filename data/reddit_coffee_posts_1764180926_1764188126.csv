1p7i648,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7i648,NYC is the only place where you need 5 apps + a miracle to get anywhere on time.,"A New Yorker apparently snapped and built a unified transit app that launched this week: **TransitGenius NYC**

Product Hunt link: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/transitgenius-nyc](https://www.producthunt.com/products/transitgenius-nyc)?

What actually impressed me:

* You can combine errands + commute in one route
* Shows coffee/ATMs/restrooms near any station
* Alerts for *specific* lines you care about
* Crowd predictions on event days
* Works with MTA, NJ Transit, LIRR, Metro-North, Citibike, Ferry, etc.
* No ads, no paywall, no corporate weirdness

Feels like something that should’ve existed in 2012 tbh.

Not promoting anything — I’m just shocked a single app finally covers the entire NYC transit ecosystem without being garbage.",1,1764188011.0,ProductHunters,0,1.0,False

I’ve always been one to take time off here and there, a 30 day hiatus a couple/few times a year, and I once did a full year sober (2019). My dad and sister are both alcoholics and I have had a problematic relationship with alcohol for a long time.

I moved to a new city 7 months ago and I’m in a neighborhood with a lot of bars. It’s really easy to walk to get a beer or go to the corner store for a bottle of wine. I’ve “tried” to do a month off 3 times since moving here and haven’t lasted longer than a week in any of my attempts. It’s the first time in my life I’ve had a hard time sticking to it, usually it’s no effort at all.

Last weekend I stopped at the bar next door after my first shift at a new job. One & done was the plan, but of course I drank more and I hadn’t eaten in like 10 hours and I ended up way too drunk. Some of my new coworkers stopped in and I was embarrassed and wanted to collect myself and make sure I didn’t make an ass of myself so I pretended like i didn’t see them at first. I was trying to convince myself to act sober bc I didn’t want to make a bad first impression. Instead I made it really weird, and I’ve been anxious about it since. I’m sure they’re not thinking about it (beyond maybe, “that was a little weird with the new chick huh?”) but to me it was bigger.

To me I’m showing my character. I’m showing people who I am. I don’t want to be a 42 year old woman who leaves work and stops at the bar next door and gets wasted. This isn’t my life. I let it get away from me. I hate it.

“But I want to be able to have a glass of wine with dinner!”

“I don’t want to miss out when I’m traveling!”

“Christmas won’t be the same without a baileys & coffee!”

I could go on and on. So many “reasons” (excuses) not to quit.

I was chatting with a sober friend the other day telling a story and within *one story* was two accounts of getting wasted and one day suffering from a debilitating hangover. It was really embarrassing.

1p7i1ed,https://v.redd.it/rq6ibfqcnn3g1,Why Starbucks Holiday Cups Are One of the Smartest Marketing Plays Every Year,"Starbucks didn’t just release **six new holiday cup designs**.

They launched a **seasonal marketing machine** that triggers emotion, repetition, social sharing, and brand loyalty—all before you even take the first sip.

This isn’t about cups.  
It’s about **behavioral marketing at scale**.

Here’s what’s *actually happening* behind the scenes.



# Why Starbucks Holiday Cups Go Viral Every Single Year

Starbucks doesn’t rely on:

* Discounts
* Aggressive advertising
* Or product innovation

They rely on:

* Emotion
* Ritual
* Visual identity
* Social signaling
* Habit stacking

The holiday cups signal:  
“Winter is here.”  
“Comfort season has started.”  
“Holiday routines are back.”

They’re not selling coffee.  
They’re selling **seasonal conversion moments**.



# The Real Strategy Behind Releasing 6 Designs (Not Just One)

Multiple designs serve three strategic purposes:

# 1. Identity Matching

Different designs allow customers to:

* Choose what represents them
* Post what matches their personality
* Feel visually “seen” by the brand

This boosts:

* Social sharing
* Organic impressions
* Free user-generated marketing



# 2. Collectibility Psychology

Multiple designs create:

* A soft “collection” instinct
* Repeat purchases
* Return visits
* Low-cost gamification

People come back not just for coffee—but for **the next design**.



# 3. Algorithm Amplification

Every new design:

* Sparks fresh posts
* Generates new photos
* Creates new engagement cycles
* Extends the holiday campaign lifespan without new ads

One product launch.  
Multiple content waves.



# Why This Works Better Than Traditional Holiday Advertising

Traditional ads rely on:

* One message
* One campaign window
* One burst of attention

Starbucks uses:

* Visual repetition
* Daily usage
* Habit-based exposure
* Physical brand touchpoints

You don’t “see” the campaign once.  
You **hold it in your hand every day**.

That’s embedded branding.



# The Branding Genius Most People Miss

Starbucks doesn’t attach:

* Heavy slogans
* Loud promotional copy
* Or aggressive calls to action

They let the **design do the emotional selling**.

This creates:

* Nostalgia
* Seasonal anticipation
* Comfort association
* Emotional trust

Emotion outperforms discounts every time.



# The Hidden Revenue Stack This Triggers

Holiday cups increase:

* Drink frequency
* Add-on purchases
* Seasonal product trials
* Gift card sales
* Brand sharing on social media

All from:  
A cup.

That’s upstream marketing leverage.



# Why Small Businesses Can Copy This Strategy

You don’t need Starbucks’ budget to use this strategy.

You can apply it by:

* Rotating seasonal branding
* Launching limited visual variations
* Creating repeatable design rituals
* Triggering emotional timing moments
* Encouraging visual sharing

Seasonal identity beats random promotion.



# About Adella Pasos 

If you’re learning how **big brands use psychology, branding, and timing to drive massive demand**, Adella Pasos is a business educator who teaches:

* Brand positioning strategy
* Digital marketing psychology
* Seasonal campaign frameworks
* SEO and visibility systems
* Long-term brand asset building

Her focus is on **understanding how demand is engineered—not just advertised**.

# The Final Truth About Starbucks Holiday Cups

They aren’t:

* Just cups
* Just designs
* Just decorations

They are:

* Habit triggers
* Emotional anchors
* Social content generators
* Daily brand reinforcements
* Seasonal revenue accelerators

Starbucks doesn’t sell coffee seasonally.  
They sell **seasonal behavior**.



# Watch Closely This Season

Every design change tells you how world-class brands:

* Control attention
* Engineer repetition
* And turn routine into revenue",1,1764187696.0,u_businessnewstv,0,1.0,False

1p7i0u2,https://i.redd.it/5ts6ufrnrn3g1.jpeg,I finally dialed in a great cup!,"Happy Thanksgiving Eve coffee fam! After countless of attempts (went through half the bag in the last two weeks), and feeling like a mad scientist - I finally made a phenomenal tasting cup! I've been brewing an Ethiopian medium roast from Counter Culture, and I really got the citrus and floral notes that they mention. Overall, it was slightly fruity and had a nice balance. And there was also a scent that reminded me of fresh cinnamon roll, which was wild. It left a nice mouth-feel, and later on - I still felt it on my breath, which was blissful.

Here's the recipe I succeeded with:

12g coffee to 200g water, so about 1:17; 
Grind size: 95 clicks on the K6; 
Temperature: 205 (American metric, lol); 
Brewer: V60

00:00 - Pour up to 60g + light swirl of dripper; 
00:45 - Pour up to 120g; 
01:45 - Pour up to 200g (the picture above was from my first attempt today, but the second attempt with 20g more water made it happen!); 
And I did a semi-aggresive swirl of dripper. 
And brew time was finished by 3:10

PS: Yes, I used a beer stein (don't judge me) as my brewing vessel because I haven't bought a nice carafe yet. ",2,1764187658.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1p7i0jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteAboutWriting/comments/1p7i0jr/specificity_in_writing/,Specificity in Writing,"One of the most transformative lessons I’ve learned about writing comes from what writers call “the ladder of abstraction.” This concept, explored by Roy Peter Clark in “Writing Tools” fundamentally changed how I think about descriptive language.

Here’s the idea: words exist on a spectrum from abstract to concrete. At the top of the ladder, you have vague, general terms. At the bottom, you have vivid, specific details that readers can see, hear, touch, taste, or smell.

Compare these sentences:

Abstract: “The man had a difficult childhood.”

Concrete: “At seven, Marcus learned to forge his mother’s signature on permission slips and cook dinner for his younger sister while their mother worked the night shift at the bottling plant.”

The second doesn’t just tell you about difficulty—it shows you (•show me don’t tell me•) specific moments that reveal the reality of that childhood. 

William Zinsser asserted, ‘writing improves in direct proportion to the number of things we can keep out of it that shouldn’t be there.’ But what should be there? Concrete details that create mental images.

This principle applies everywhere. 
Don’t write “beverage” when you mean “coffee.” 
Don’t write “coffee” when you mean “a lukewarm cup of diner coffee with a film on top.” The more you can anchor your writing in the specific and sensory, the more your readers will actually experience what you’re describing rather than just processing information about it.

Stephen King puts it bluntly in “On Writing” - “The road to hell is paved with adverbs.” Why? Because we reach for adverbs when we haven’t chosen strong enough verbs and nouns. “She walked slowly” becomes “She trudged.” “He said angrily” becomes “He snapped.” Each specific word does more work than a generic word plus modifier.

Exercise: take any paragraph you’ve written and circle every general word—thing, stuff, nice, good, bad, very, really. Then ask yourself: can I replace this with something more specific? 

That practice alone will transform your writing.

now this week, we were supposed to meet on wednesday for a coffee date at noon and he texted me at 4am that he is out drinking again but he will still see me at 12. i told him that i think it will not be enjoyable for either of us if he shows up hungover and running on 0 sleep, so we should rain check.

again, he was really apologetic and seemed to feel terrible about the situation. but this was already the second time he pulled this and we haven't even met. first of all, it's a wednesday and not a special occasion, so there is no particular reason to go out drinking. secondly, you planned to show up to a first date drunk/hungover and tired? what kind of a first impression would that make on a woman?

1p7hw6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1p7hw6r/decaffeinated_products_should_be_more_widely/,Decaffeinated products should be more widely available than the caffeinated ones,"I believe that it should be easier to access decaffeinated products (coffee products, tea, sodas etc) in stores and in coffee shops, and the caffeinated ones in a separate section like the decaf ones currently are. Caffeine is an addictive drug that too many people are dependent on, and caffeine can clash with lots of prescribed medications or mental illnesses.

For example- countless times I’ve gone to Starbucks or whatever and ordered a decaf, and I know the barista couldn’t be bothered and just made me a normal drink with caffeine. Caffeine gives me panic attacks and makes me feel very ill. So I think caffeine should be the thing you have to ask to be added, rather than asking for decaf. If you wanted caffeine and then didn’t get it, you wouldn’t have any adverse effects like what I described above.

All caffeinated products should still be just as available as they are now (not suggesting they should be yeeted into space), just kept in the same place as things like Red Bull. But if you were to go into a store to quickly buy a bottle of Dr Pepper or a cold brew coffee drink, it will be decaf unless you specifically get the caffeinated version.

Back home, service charge would be added automatically so there’s no dispute, and I have no issues tipping say 15% if I actually sit down and eat out at a restaurant, but what are your thoughts on tipping if you are just getting a cup of coffee or milk tea to go at a cafe or a local food court? The screen is asking for 15-20% tips which seems a bit excessive for a takeaway coffee but I also don’t want to appear rude in case that’s the cultural norm here. And what about eating at say Aberdeen food court or anywhere that’s basically self serving? Do you normally tip?",6,1764187149.0,richmondbc,8,1.0,False

1p7hp3f,https://i.redd.it/xc08gvmgpn3g1.png,Started from scratch but still skeptical,"I'm Maddie and I'm now in 6th grade but 3 years ago when I was in 3rd grade, My house burnt down and my parents hired a private investigator to see how it started and he said it was from an exploded battery. Now, I'm not saying he was lying but, I'm still pretty skeptical about his word because I'm not saying we were slean freaks but we weren't dirty either, so when he said it started from and exploded battery I was confused because all our battery's were inside and the fire started outside on the right side of the porch and then he said the sun must have caught the dry leaves and vines under our porch on fire but while our house was literally burning in front of me, I was checking for how it could have started and what I saw proved what I thought was right. The bottom part of the porch wasn't on fire yet so he had definitely lied, but then I was confused on how the fire really started. I'm starting to think someone started it, we were a very helpful family to our community and were very liked. Some people were probably jealous so I think one of the jealous people set it on fire, but if they did, they forgot about 1 minor detail. We were very liked and we got back up on our feet in under 2 years and now we are doing a lot better than before. My parents own 4 businesses and a 2 Acer yard. We own a coffee shop, 2 foxes in different locations, and a nonprofit business where we help fire victims in our area, but we still have people who try to bring us down and I feel like its all somehow connected but we have people in our new community who back us up and protect us.

1p7hkya,https://i.redd.it/ayi8kekp0i3g1.jpeg,"Anuanna: The Karda Jewel - Book 1 by Madeline McQueen - an ungainly mishmash of knock-off Harry Potter, discount Twilight, and an off-brand whimsical Disney princess story. An under-cooked, cliched, and perplexing mess.","This book and its two sequels were a recent discovery for me. Given my fascination for bad books, particularly bad fantasy books, I'm always on the hunt for something to read next. I just can't stay away from the rabbit hole. I must know more and I keep exploring new depths. So much so, I'm currently on the hunt for physical copies of Audra Winter's *The Age of Scorpius* and Kenneth Eng's *Spell Knights*. And those are the the two primary searches, as I've been making a list of books that have gone out of print to find and possibly lampoon if I can find them (Physical copies only. Digital simply won't do). However, I'm certainly not out of books to lampoon here, which is what brings me to this book and its sequels (Which I'll probably cover later on, as I'm currently reading through the second book).

 These books have barely any reviews and almost no one seems to know of them. Amazon has no reviews, while on Goodreads, this book has a 2.86/5-star average from only seven ratings with three reviews, the second has a 4-star average from four ratings and no reviews, and the third has no ratings or reviews at all. Curious numbers to say the least. It's clear I'm venturing into largely unexplored territory. It should also be noted that this is a new cover, as the original had a hand-drawn cover, looking like a very rough draft of this version (Same goes for the second book). It's certainly more pleasant to look at than the original cover, however cheesy it may be.

The only information I can gather for the background of these books comes from the author herself, who seems to be quite the busybody - author, dancer, dancing tutor, actress, model, freelance photographer, blogger, and gamer based in the United Kingdom, according to her personal website. For the creation of these books, this is what I gleaned from the ""About the Author"" section in the second book:

**I began writing Anuanna in 2015 when I was planning on creating another film project. I didn't want to make another horror or thriller film, so I thought I would be daring and try a new genre.**

**That's how Anuanna was born. I created my own character (Anne) that I wanted to play in the film, but then I had to think of a genre as far away from horror as I could. I thought of writing a romance and that's when the character, Victor was created.**

**It didn't take me long to settle on writing a magical, romantic fantasy. I first dismissed the idea of having Anne and Victor as wizards then thought about maybe making them vampires, werewolves or aliens. Being a fan of all these genres but liking the magical side a little more (also those genres have all been done in a romantic way), I decided to go down the witch route. I also don't think I could have done well at all making Anne and Victor any other magical creature. I did consider other species, but my heart was already set on witch's and wizard's.**

**Sadly, as I didn't have the funds to create a film on this scale, I turned Anuanna into a novel.**

**Some characters in Anuanna, are inspired on people I know or have met. Anne is based on myself, in fact, most of Anne's past shares mine. A few of the other characters also have a couple of my personal experiences.**

Ah, 'tis the familiar dream of many modern fantasy writers. The dreams of a film adaptation. And, as you have read, it's also a Mary Sue story. Well, at least McQueen is upfront about that part, even if it doesn't bode well for the story most of the time.

I do wonder, however, why she thought that doing a romance about wizards and witches was a new idea compared to the rest of the proposed ideas. Plus, it's not like she avoids having vampires and werewolves in the mix (Though the vampires only appear near the end of this book. They don't take on more of a presence until the second book. Werewolves also only begin appearing in the second book. No aliens, though. Not so far at least). It also doesn't entirely avoid the horror genre, it's just not a primary genre this series seems to deal with. It's a romantasy book through and through. We're certainly not venturing into some new genre bender by any means.

And, yes, as you perhaps noticed, instead of ""witches and wizards"" she instead wrote ""witch's and wizard's."" You can expect to encounter such grammatical and spelling errors sprinkled throughout this book series, despite the author stating these books were edited and rewritten. Not a deal breaker, as even some books I've loved have had such issues (Like Christopher Rowley's *Bazil Broketail*  series, where ""lead"" is used instead of ""led"" every time. There was also an instance where ""big"" is spelled as ""bg"" and another where ""glass"" is spelled as ""glasss."" These books were professionally published, by the way. But these were minor quibbles that didn't detract from a grand series of adventures, whereas this book, they add to a tally of problems).

The book begins with a prologue with two middle-aged men, Nigel and Quinton, sitting on a settee by a fireplace. Nigel is agitated and Quinton is uneasy about this visit to Nigel's home. They are then given tea and accompanied in the room by Nigel's wife, Petri. The trio stare at a portrait of the couple with a young daughter who is unnamed. Quinton bumbles by remarking that he thought they had a son, making the couple upset and Nigel saying:

**'Let's cut the pleasantries, shall we?'**

Quinton has been having visions of an unnamed female who seems to be of great importance, whose magical gift has begun to manifest, finally. They talk about making a move, but it seems like it will be with great difficulty:

**'Impossible. They've been watching her since she was born, they've been watching her family for centuries. You won't get near her without being seen.'**

**'Then what do we do?'**

**'Wait. She must go to Anuanna.'**

**Petri speaks in a timid voice. 'So, we just let them take her? Then what? How will we know when it's time?'**

**Nigel puts on a calming voice for Petri. 'We'll have eyes and ears on her, don't worry.**

**'You mean...*****He*** **can't do it.'**

**'I have other contacts, reliable ones. They'll do the job.'**

**Petri looks down at the floor worried as Nigel looks at Quinton with an irritated expression.'**

Okay, not a bad start. Setting up mystery and intrigue. Sure, we know it'll be the protagonist, but it also sets up other questions like about Nigel and Petri's son, who some of these other mysterious figures may be, what their motivations are, and whatnot.

The trouble is, this is a very condensed version that I've provided. It's not that the prologue is long by any means, nor is it just for a usual sake of brevity. No, for I must now show you the start of an unusual problem the novel has - one that I don't recall ever having before in other bad books. *These* are the first two paragraphs of the prologue:

**The decor of the room is a dark red carpet and light brown wallpaper, patterned with dark reddish-brown tree branches and leaves. Designer furniture and ornaments in glass show cabinets, on shelves and tables, fill the room in an immaculate form. Covered in the room just east of a blazing, open, white stone fireplace, sits a burgundy, cushioned, curved settee that nearly makes a complete circle. It can seat a party of a dozen people, a few more at a squeeze. In the middle, sits a round mocha coffee table. Underneath, lies a long rectangular red rug with black and gold patterning.**

**Even though there is an elegant chandelier hanging in the centre of the room, the only source of light is coming from the fire and the two, long floor lamps with deep red shades on the opposite side of the room in both corners, creating a quaint glow.**

Some might argue this is to set up detail, but this going about detail the wrong way. It also instills no atmosphere or mood. No, this is how the novel begins. An info-dump about interior decorating. This also isn't a one-time thing. It happens multiple times. I kid you not, throughout this book, I ended up learning more about the interior decorating than more pressing matters, like plot, character development, and world building. It's unfortunately not even the only problem that takes precedence over the important aspects. I hope you also enjoy constant descriptions about fashion and shopping montages, because it has a lot of those, too, in favor of more important details.

I'm also not demanding the story hit the ground running, I'm perfectly fine with placid, slow pacing, including characters taking in their surroundings. For example, I recently finished Henry James' *The American*, a marvelous novel that I adored. It's very slow paced, including the opening where Christopher Newman is in the Louvre, taking in his surroundings, while the reader is introduced to the expat protagonist and his starry eyed notions of being in Paris before troubles befall him in the Old World. The opening is very intricately woven, allowing the reader the pleasure to take in what's going on. *Anuanna's* opening does no such thing. It's a wall the reader must scale over before characters are even introduced. Then of course, we must know what characters are wearing and be told of how they are, instead of being shown. Another wall. After scaling that one, then the intrigue is in place. We're only at the prologue and already there are problems.

We are then finally introduced to our protagonist, Anne, who lives in a village in Kent, England. She's in her late 30's, works in retail, has a boyfriend named James whom she has been living with for three years, and has two dogs - Sunny, a Golden Retriever, and Charlie, a Golden Labrador. They're on their way to visit and stay with Anne's family. They don't get to do this often and it will be a rare occasion when the family will be together.

The reader is given another issue when the dogs begin acting up during the drive:

**Now James decides to pipe up.'Do we have to bring those dogs everywhere we go?'**

**He's not a fan of animals as much as I am, which I'm used to so I don't take much notice of his comment. 'Yes, you know they go everywhere with me whenever I can take them, especially when we go out all day.'**

**'Yes, I know.'**

You've been living together for three years. Why is this being brought up like you've only just started dating? Shouldn't this have been something sorted out a while ago? If you ever aspire to be a writer, keep this sort of error in mind, so that you can avoid making it. Enough small errors can make quite a pile of badness.

Along the way, Anne starts hearing voices that call out her name. Understandably, James doesn't know what to say when she speaks of it. However, the dogs are looking at her oddly, which makes Anne uneasy. She tries to put it out of her mind, but can't make heads or tails of what she's been hearing.

Upon arrival, Anne goes about the necessary greetings to family members and the girlfriend of one of her brothers. She also spends some time with her parents' new dogs, Tawzer and Ellie. Banal conversations ensue of the ""How are you doing?"", ""How's work?"", ""You still work in retail?"" variety. Anne seems to struggle to maintain such conversations, especially when it comes to her job she dislikes. What she really wants is to pursue a career working with animals.

After mulling about with banal small talk and dinner, James leaves for his parents' house while Anne stays behind. Once again, the voices calling her name occur, only there are more of them. She thinks family members might be calling her, but are not. It's only when the dogs gather around her that she realizes she's actually hearing the dogs, who are communicating, telepathically. Particularly, it seems to be coming from the Golden Retriever, Sunny, who urges Anne that they go somewhere private to talk about what she's experiencing.

Anne takes Sunny and the rest of the dogs for a walk. After a distance, they're finally alone, where Sunny and the other dogs begin to explain what's going on. Unfortunately for the reader, now comes the dreaded exposition info-dump, which lasts for four pages. Granted, I've certainly experienced worse info-dumps (It doesn't leave me despondent, like say, Robert Stanek's *Ruin Mist* or Norman Boutin's *Empress Theresa* did), but it's still like having take a swig of an unpleasant drink. I'll spare you the longer gist when she learns she's an Ottwa (Pronounced All-tah, according to the text):

**'An Ottwa is the name of your race, the race who can talk to another species. You are the first Ottwa to be born with an active gift in probably five hundred years, and before him, it was several millennia. Your gift is very rare, there are no longer people of your kind.'**

Basically, they were rare to begin with, but were wiped out in a great war with few survivors. Somewhere in Anne's ancestry lies the answer. While an inherited gift, descendants rarely activate the gift, so it remains dormant. So, Anne is the first Ottwa with active gifts in centuries, making her unique, as demanded by Mary Sue plot devices.

Sunny also informs her that soon she'll be taken to a magical academy in a place called Anuanna. Since her powers have now come to fruition, she can expect a summons shortly. Then they head home and when Anne wakes up the next day, she thinks it was all a dream, only to find out it was not. Despite this shock in a seemingly normal existence, Anne is pleased about this. After waking up and having an awkward conversation with one of her brothers over hearing her talk to someone, Sunny points her to an envelope that has appeared in her room overnight:

***Dear Miss Hunter,*** 

***I want to formally congratulate you on coming into your gifts. Congratulations! We are very excited about welcoming you to Anuanna ( which I'm sure your companion has told you about). We have a member of staff coming to meet you tonight at your local park by the Elm Tree, at 8 p.m. sharp, so please try to be on time. This gives you the day to explain to your family and say goodbye (only for a while). You can use any explanation, but please keep in mind that you must be careful of what you say.***

***I apologise for all the secrecy, but I'm sure you can understand why that is.***

***We look forward to meeting you. Until then, if you have any other questions, Mr. Sunny can answer you as best he is able until your meeting tonight.***

***Best wishes,***

***Principle Gilwich.***

Yes, ""principle"" instead of ""principal"" is used. Now Anne must come up with an excuse for why she's suddenly leaving her family and boyfriend behind. She decides to say she applied to a university some distance away, that she's been accepted, and has to leave at night. This confuses her family, but they seem to accept it, while James is upset and leaves in a huff, thinking Anne wants to break up with him.

The time finally comes to go to the park, Anne says her goodbyes, and brings the dogs along where they are greeted by Councillor Kench, who was apparently sent by Gilwich to escort Anne to Anuanna. Before they can go anywhere, the group is attacked by hooded figures, who upon attacking the dogs, face a wrath that stirs within Anne, who summons various forest animals to attack the figures. After winning the fight, Anne is escorted by Kench a short distance from the family home, so the dogs can return, except for Sunny, who will be accompanying Anne to the academy. After a queasy magical transport, Anne and Sunny find themselves in Anuanna and settled into an apartment, where she is introduced to Charlotte, who will be one of her friends - a Resurrector who dreams of being an interior decorator (She even decorated Anne's apartment in preparation for her arrival).

The next morning comes another note, detailing her list of classes, her schedule, and what supplies she'll need for school the following day, leading to a day of shopping, curious glances from people, setting up accounts (The school provides a set amount of money, though the student, if an adult, will have to get a job for more income), misunderstandings, displays of power upon people learning that Anne is an Ottwa and Charlotte is a Resurrector, and more. Needless to say, as per chosen one cliches, Anne is already making a stir before her first day of class, where one teacher has to save her and Charlotte from a crowd of people after their abilities become known (With a child trying to get Charlotte to save a dead puppy, which she does manage to bring back. Or an old woman who tries to get Anne to figure out what's wrong with her cat, Mittens, who turns out to be a girl expecting a litter).

From here on, Anne tackles her new life at school, becomes best friends with Charlotte, becomes friends with a guy named Liam, develops a crush on her magical defence teacher, Victor Gray, studies and grows in her magical abilities, makes enemies of the rich asshole student, Alex, shopping and hanging out montages galore, and more. This all leads to the aforementioned Karda Jewel, though that won't have much of a presence in this book.

This all sounds like it could be a fun time. It should have been a fun time, in fact. Too bad the story is bogged down by drawing out smaller details and fluff instead of what should be driving things forward.

There are far too many instances of interior decorating, info-dumping instead of world building that feels organic and immersive, Mary Sue nonsense, and scenes of shopping and dull hangouts. It's made all the more frustrating because the pieces are there. There are a lot of good ideas - it's not like it's lacking in inspiration like other bad fantasy books. But all these more important details get pushed away, happen too quickly, and  happen too conveniently while being padded with inane fluff that mistakes itself for world building and depth.

Even with the chapter dedicated to her first day of school, which is a whopping 72 pages in length, the reader is never given more than bland surface level detail of the classes and the author simply telling us impressions of the teachers. You know what the classes are and what goes on in them in a basic way, but the reader will never feel immersed in such an environment. Classes become background noise with occasional cursory details. Even details like how students are split into age groups are never given much in the way of development. Beyond Anne and her friend group, one never gets a real idea of the milieu of Anuanna Academy or the world of Anuanna itself.

There also seem to be hidden school politics, like the rich asshole, Alex, who makes it a point to bully Anne (Even injuring her dog during a class, and during a final exam, tries to outright kill her and her friends). Apparently, Alex's parents have connections with a barely spoken of council, but I know practically nothing about the council or what Alex's parents even do, beyond also being assholes like their son (Like Alex's father trying to attack Anne after Alex gets in trouble). How are they able to wield this sort of power over the school? I don't know.

Compare this sort of thing to J.K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series where fans can vividly recall even the most minor details. It teems with life and detail about the students, the school, the magical world, and a whole lot more. Or, a personal favorite book of mine, Joan Lindsay's *Picnic at Hanging Rock*. Lindsay vividly described Appleyard College from the students to the staff, the social hierarchy (The prestige of Miranda the ""Botticelli Angel""to the outcast, Sara) and more. When the girls go missing (Miranda, the most popular; Marion, the smartest; and Irma, the daughter of a wealthy family in Europe - you clearly and succinctly understood their importance to the image and prestige of the school and how it crumbles, showing the dark underbelly). None of that is here in *Anuanna*. The reader is kept at arm's length for any such details.

When Anne develops feelings for her professor, Victor, after two days attending the academy, it just ends up falling into place much too conveniently. James is hardly ever spoken of, makes almost no attempt to contact Anne, and then when he finally does, it's over 350 pages into this 471-page book and around Christmas during the events of the novel. He ends up breaking up with her. However, it's difficult to feel anything when he receives less development than the interior decorating. I barely know him and have no reason to care when the shoe finally drops on Anne.

Something like this should have been much more impactful. Right now, I'm reading Leo Tolstoy's *Anna Karenina* for the first time. I'm only 330-odd pages into its 850-odd pages, but there has been so much going on. Even the opening when the reader is thrown into the troubles of the Oblonskys' marriage due to Stiva's affair with the French governess, which understandably devastates his wife, Dolly. Then there's Stiva's friend, Levin, who wishes to marry Dolly's sister, Kitty. Kitty in turn, at the behest of her mother and social status, instead has her eyes set on Count Vronsky. Meanwhile, things take a turn when Stiva's sister, Anna, who despite being married, becomes enamored with Count Vronsky.

There's a lot of build up before Anna and Vronsky consummate, as Anna tries to fight her feelings for him. When their affair commences, it leads to great turmoil for both parties and those around them. Kitty turns down Levin only for her interest in Vronsky blow up in her face at a social gathering. Levin is devastated and returns to the country, intent on renouncing his old dreams of marriage and family. Anna must conceal the affair from her husband, risking not only her marriage, but also her son. Her husband, Alexei, suspects something is going on, but tries to deny it and bury himself in other things. Vronsky's family is displeased with this affair as it is hindering progress in his career. And the Oblonsky family is still in turmoil from Stiva's infidelity. When Anna finally reveals the truth to her husband, it hurts like hell and the agony of waiting for the shoe to drop on this moment is intense. I vividly felt every moment...and I'm not even halfway through the damn book - this is just so far. I'm loving it, though.

Anne's relationship crumbling has no effect. And as dictated by genre tropes, it turns out Victor also has feelings for Anne. Despite reservations, given the inappropriate nature of a student-teacher relationship, the two go about it, trying to maintain secrecy. It gets more development than her relationship with James, but by the time it begins, the novel is practically over (And so far, it's still not terribly compelling in the second book). It also feels surface level. It basically boils down to ""I care for you after only a short time, and God, you're hot."" Not much to go on or be invested in (And no sex scene until the sequel, either. No smut for you, dear reader). It's not even enjoyably torrid or melodramatic.

The problem overall, is that this book spends far too much time setting things up, rather than getting a move on. It's also not a book where despite slow pacing, the reader can take in the view or have characters worth following around, even when they're just hanging out. Going back to Henry James, I loved *The Bostonians*. It's very placid and slow-paced, but its trio of characters - Basil Ransom, Olive Chancellor, and Verena Tarrant - are so fascinating, I could follow them anywhere and not be bored. It even made the death of side character, Miss Birdseye, feel poignant and beautiful. In *Anuanna*, I'm detached from the story, the characters, and the world because of how little development they're given.

Even Anne herself hardly has any depth. Self inserts aren't a bad thing, necessarily, but they need to be handled with care. After all, Levin from *Anna Karenina* is essentially Tolstoy. But not every self-insert gets to be Levin. He is still enormously flawed, must face those flaws as they are laid bare to him, and try to overcome them. Anne is a generic plain girl who happens to have magical powers, starts off awkwardly but then kicks ass at magic, is liked by everyone except cartoonish douchebags, and of course, the super hot guy suddenly wants to be with the plain girl in a forbidden romance.

It also has a tonal problem. Sometimes it wants to be serious (Even having a content warning about violence and language), but it never gets very edgy or intense (Not even in language. ""Fuck"" is only said once and maybe a few minor curse words. It's in the sequel where multiple ""fucks"" are dropped on a given page). Sometimes, it wants to be lighthearted, but the comedy falls flat and feels more like a third-rate romantic comedy (Dear God, not another shopping montage!). It doesn't take the serious seriously enough and the comedy misses so many opportunities (Imagine going back to school in your 30's and having to deal with bullying akin to high school all over again. Or what about the class clown/slacker and his shenanigans? Yes, there is such a character. His name is Felix, who is also an ex-boyfriend of Charlotte's. Despite these scenarios and taking place in a magical school, it never takes any real stabs at humor possibilities).

In the end, it's all set up with a rickety, bare-bones foundation. It hardly spends time on the important things like characters, plot, and world building. Instead, it forsakes these elements for exposition info-dumps, interior decorating, shopping montages, and cursory glimpses of what could have been. What a shame. Hopefully the sequels can greatly improve (The second is showing potential of being so bad it's funny, but I'm not sure if it'll hold out or devolve into boredom like its predecessor).

I was dumbfounded. As an 31 year old Archlinux enjoyer, no girl ever said this to me. I was happy. But, I was afraid too. What if he doesn't like me? What if her dad is a Mac user?So anyway, long story short. Together we went to their house.

I met her dad on the door. My gf introduced me ""here is Jake, my boyfriend"" and I said

""yes I am, and I use Arch btw""

He looked at me as if he didn't get the joke. He said in a weird way, ""nice to meet you Jake"" while squashing my hand a little too hard. Such a boomer dad, probably doesn't even know about Archlinux, but no worries. I am gonna teach him.

So… we sat down in the living room. Classic boomer setup: huge Windows 11 PC with RGB lights that scream “my nephew built this for me,” a 55-inch TV playing some football replay, and a coffee table full of coasters that say “Live Laugh Love.”

Her dad (let’s call him Nick) sat across from me, arms crossed, staring like I’m a suspicious .exe file he’s about to right-click and scan. My girlfriend tried to break the ice:

“Dad, he’s so smart, he is a computer scientist.”

Nick raised one eyebrow:

“Hmm.Which Windows are you using son?”

I smiled the smile of a man who’s about to drop a nuke.

“No Windows sir. I am using Arch Linux, btw. I just said that at the door""

My gf, soon to be wife; facepalmed.

Silence.

You could hear the RGB fans spinning. Nick leaned in slowly:

“…Arch?WTF is that, a virus?” My girlfriend facepalmed. I felt alive.

“No sir, Windows is the malware actually. I compile my own kernel in Arch Linux with the help of pacman.”

He blinked twice.

“You said Pacman? Hey I know that game!”

I almost cried from joy. Anyway, I pulled out my ThinkPad X220 running i3wm showed him my terminal.All girls loved my terminal, well mostly.

Nick stared at the neofetch art:

“Tf is this? Are you a hacker?” My girlfriend: “Dad please...”

I saw my chance.

“Nick I can hook up an Archlinux for you in 20 minutes. It’s easy peasy.”

He stood up suddenly, went to his RGB monster PC, opened the case like a man possessed, pointed at the glowing insides and shouted:

“I got a DAMN RTX3090, 128 GB RAM, liquid cooling and shit, what is that plastic box you have?”

I looked at my 12-year-old ThinkPad with 16 GB RAM and a battery that lasts 9 hours and said calmly:

“Nick I got 42 days of uptime on this laptop, how much you have huh?”

My girlfriend dragged me out of the house 3 minutes later. While we were leaving I heard Murat Amca yelling from the balcony:

“Was that ARCHLINUX you said? Come at 9 PM tomorrow, and install that or you won’t see my daughter ever” Don't know if he was serious or not though. My girlfriend is mad at me now, but I already ordered a 1 TB NVMe for him. Wedding is back on the table, I think. I can’t understand tho does he like me or hate me?

About 4 years ago I got my first espresso setup, a Bambino and Eureka Mignon Manuale (or notte).

I've saved a bit of money and I want to start upgrading my setup.

Right now I mostly drink flat whites at home, but I want to get into making light roast espresso's as well.

I don't have enough saved up to both upgrade my grinder and espresso machine, so I'll do one this year, and the other one somewhere next year.

My plan was to upgrade my Bambino to a Lelit Elizabeth, but then I started thinking, would it be better to get a better grinder instead?



For grinders, I've been looking at the Timemore sculptor a64s and a78s, and the df64 gen 2

But I'm open to any other recommendations too.

Ideally I would like to have a grinder that can switch between espresso and filter easily, but it's not a must, I might just keep the Manuale for filter.

I would like the grinder to be under 800 euro ideally.



TLDR:

Want to upgrade setup for better tasting coffee.

Espresso machine or grinder first?

And what grinder should I get for light roast espresso?

I like the idea/versatility of the 64mm flat burr options.

Obviously one is the value buy, but potentially very high value. Additionally, with Sculptor Gen II potentially coming ~6 months does it make sense to go with the cheaper option and bridge until Gen 2 Sculptor?

SEX MADE ME LOSE MY MARRIAGE

Dear Women in Marriage,

I wish to share my story as a testimony to all of you walking through this sacred journey called marriage. My name is Sofia, I am 39 years old, a divorcee after 13 years of marriage, and a mother of three beautiful children, two boys and one girl.
I got married when I was 23 years old. At that time, I was young, inexperienced, and too naive to fully understand what marriage truly meant. My husband was a good man of caring, home-loving, and responsible. Yet, in my youthful ignorance, I mistook my desire for freedom as strength, not realizing that marriage itself requires maturity, patience, and understanding.

By the age of 31, I already had three children. Life became a routine of motherhood and house management to caring for my husband, tending to the children, and ensuring everything ran smoothly. Two of my children were already in school, and the youngest was under the care of our nanny. I finally had some freedom to move around, go shopping, and do things on my own.

Then, one ordinary evening while shopping, something happened that changed my entire life.
As I reached for an item, I felt a gentle touch from behind. Turning back, I saw a man smiling warmly at me.
He greeted me politely, and we exchanged a few words.
He was charming, well-spoken, and carried himself with confidence. When I was done shopping, he insisted on paying my bill and walked me to the car. I felt seen, admired, and appreciated.
Later that evening, I couldn't stop thinking about him.
His kindness reminded me of what my marriage had been missing or at least what I thought it was missing.

Two days later, he texted me, asking if we could meet for coffee. I agreed. We talked for hours. He was attentive, understanding, and seemed to say everything a lonely woman longs to hear. By the end of our conversation, he suggested we go somewhere private to continue talking.
I didn't resist. We booked a room, and that evening, everything changed.

The intimacy we shared made me feel alive again. But what I didn't realize was that moment of pleasure would cost me everything I had built for years. When I went back home, I started comparing him to my husband. His words, his touch, even his presence. Suddenly, my husband felt boring, weak, and unfulfilling. I began to avoid him and withheld intimacy, believing that the man I had met was what I truly needed.

Our affair continued until the man I was seeing asked me to leave my husband so that we could start a new life together. Blinded by emotions and lust, I caused fights at home and finally walked out of my marriage, believing I was walking into happiness.

Today marks three years since I left my home. But I can tell you this from the bottom of my heart — there is nothing special out here to celebrate.
The man I left my husband for turned out to be nothing close to the man I abandoned. After just three months of living together, he began coming home late, avoiding me, and entertaining other women. He even started reminding me that I had children with another man. The same person who once made me feel wanted began to make me feel worthless.

I have suffered greatly for the choice I made that evening in that shopping mall. I lost my home, my husband, my children's respect, and my peace of mind, all for a moment that was never worth it.
Dear women, if you are married, please value your marriage.

Do not be deceived by attention, flattery, or momentary pleasure.
The man who can make you a wife is far better than the one who can only make you a girlfriend.
If you have challenges, work on them. If you feel lonely, talk about it. But never destroy your home because of what looks exciting outside. It fades quickly.

I don't know if my husband will ever forgive me, but l've made peace with God and with myself. My story is not to seek sympathy, but to warn and guide others who may be standing where I once stood.

Learn from me. Protect your marriage. Value your husband. And above all, guard your heart.

With love and truth,

I was so consumed with being *enough* for you. To be *good* enough. Because then maybe you would see me. 

I thought that it was impossible to feel that strongly about someone and not have it be reciprocated. I, eternally the skeptic, privately entertained the idea of some twisted concept of destiny to make our situation make sense to me. That we had to do independent work before we could come together. 

You always believed in the zodiac, and I thought that was so silly. But I remember thinking to myself maybe there was something to it, especially if it explained what was happening. 

Here is the truth. 

The truth is in all of this time that my thoughts have wandered back to you, you have gotten married and then divorced and then married again and we never connected. That's the harsh reality. 

And 10 years ago, that might have reinforced the idea that *I* needed to do some kind of work to get you to pick me. After all, you never did. At best I could be third choice. The more realistic option is that I'm not on the roster. 

But the truth is also that I was never lacking a thing. Yes, I had gaps and no I was not perfect.  But I was loving. I was hard working. I had an excellent sense of humor you yourself commented on, and I was in fact quite bright. I was ambitious and bright eyed and bushy tailed and frankly, visually beautiful. I made great coffee, was a lovely bartender, compassionate towards animals, successful cultivar of plants, incredible music taste, etc. I was passionate, relentlessly curious, humble, persistent. 

 I was soft and fragile and on the cusp of being dragged through massive amounts of trauma, but I was a human being worth loving. More than that, I deserved adoration. 

The truth is, you never loved me. You were never interested in even seeing what that might be like. At best, you appreciated the bit of attention you recieved. And you tried to extract that from me when it was convenient for you. 

The truth is, even men who have loved me have never loved me the way I deserve to be loved. 

So I'm going to start loving myself that way. The way I remember desperately wishing you would. The way I convinced myself others were capable of. 

I am done trying to fix myself so others will love me. Everyone else is too broken to show up for me the way I deserve, so I will show up for myself. ",2,1764186115.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

She ended up with back pain and went to get ice when she came back she announced rented a cabin. She never talked to me first, never tried to call because she said she didn’t have service (the camp store literally had a phone) I asked her if the cabin had two beds and she said she didn’t know but probably. 

It made me feel sidelined, like I wasn’t part of the decision at all. It was a big shift from our plan, and I would’ve appreciated being included.  Also, the cabin ended up having roaches.  When I found out about the camp switch I said something that sounded really bad.  But honestly it’s not what I meant at all.  I started to say  “I dont care about your back pain”. I immediately corrected myself and said “I dont care about the cabin and it’s understandable that you want to sleep in a bed with back pain, I just wanted to be in the loop”. But she latches onto the mistake and says “Are you kidding me?  You don’t care about my back pain?”  I jumbled the words so badly.  I did feel super awful about it.  That is absolutely not what I meant at all. Before all this dinner was weird.  She kept saying because I paid for the campground she was gonna pay for dinner that night.  She also paid for coffee that morning and dinner the night before.  Which is fine.  I was a little annoyed because when people pay for me I feel the need to be cheap.  
The waiter took our drink and appetizer order and brought chips and salsa and Brussels sprouts. He never came back to take our actual order.  She ate most of the chips and all of the Brussels sprouts (which is fine) but then said she was “full.” Then she suggested we share an entrée. I told her, “It’s okay, I’ll pay for my own so I can order what I want.” She didn’t respond, so I figured maybe she didn’t hear me or disregarded it I still ordered what I wanted, chicken enchiladas with no chicken, so basically cheese. She commented on the order like we were sharing, so I resigned and ordered one cheese and one chicken.  She asked me if I would have eaten both of the enchiladas if they were cheese and I told her yes this is where it got really awkward she didn’t touch any of the chicken enchilada. It honestly felt like she unintentionally guilted me into ordering something she didn’t even touch.  So then I felt weird like I was being a bitch so I left two bites of my cheese enchilada so she didn’t feel bad that she hijacked my meal.  I know that part was stupid.  I should have eaten the last bites.  Honorable mentions:  She forgot a jacket (freezing weather), hiking bag, sunscreen, sunglasses.  I gave her a balaclava to keep and let her borrow a wool jacket, an extra blanket, sunglasses and use my sunscreen.  I did not let her use my backpack for storing anything.  I just didn’t have the space after shedding my layers.  She always mentions she always forgets everything and her best friend just always picks up the slack.",1,1764185539.0,AmItheAsshole,5,0.67,False
1p7h3cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrancingPretties/comments/1p7h3cz/golden_fields_chapter_five_reality_check/,Golden Fields Chapter Five: Reality Check,"Whats good guys. I have the next chapter of Golden Fields for you. Lets see how Morel takes the news of her farm about to be taken away.

\-------

It took little more than an hour for Luke to crest the hill through the orchard. The farmhouse and all the adjacent buildings came into view, heat rising off them in the midday sun.

Morel was nowhere in sight; the free-ranging rabbits and the barn cats were the only signs of life within the area.

Once through the outer fence, Luke slowed the truck and scanned the area, his mind frantically adding to the list of need-to-dos. Every missing screw, bit of rust, loose tie-down, and speck of dirt was noted as he drove past, forming a lengthy list for each building within seconds.

Luke groaned, thinking about all he would have to inspect on the inside of the buildings: hoppers, sorters, and the entire interiors of the workers' residences.

That was a can of worms he dreaded opening, knowing the havoc several years of emptiness wrought upon buildings.

Without active use, wood would rot, glass would chip, and insulation would morph from shields against the cold into the nested hovels of small rodents. All things that would take Luke a great deal of time to determine, and far more than that to repair. Enough so that belaying such mending duties to focus on the harvest season was the prudent option.

Luke felt a weight build on his shoulders with every minor malefaction for a healthy agricultural operation he found. Goldens Fields was far from a lost cause; he had solved far more complex issues, yet the new deadline remained an inescapable thing.

It was his and Morel's sword of Damocles.

Luke tossed the truck into park and got out, halfway flying through the doors to the farmhouse. His heart raced, worry nipping at his heels like a pack of vicious hounds. The rabbits watched him with anticipation from behind the fence, expecting the usual treats Morel carried for them, but Luke brought no such tidings.

Once inside the house, Luke frantically looked around the first room, seeking Morel, needing to sit her down, deliver the grim news, and make an objective plan for precisely what they were going to do.

Having not seen hide nor hair of the elegant woman, he went room by room throughout the house, approaching his search with all the subtlety of a quasar.

The ruckus he was making drew the woman’s attention. As Luke reached the second floor, he found her peeking out of one of the rooms he had never been inside. Morel wore a paint-stained apron and held a brush in her hand as if it were a knife.

“What in the world are you doing, making such a racket? You scared the dickens outa me,” Morel complained, sticking the brush into an apron pocket.

“We have an issue,” Luke held Crowley’s chip out toward Morel. “A coalition rep named—“

“Is Crowley back?” Morel grumbled, taking the chip in her hand and rolling her eyes.

“Wait, you know him?” Luke asked.

“Of course. He has been hounding me about making money for the farm for the last two years.” Morel replied. “What about ‘I will figure it out’ does he not understand?”

“It’s not that he doesn’t understand. It’s that the coalition only has so much patience, and all he does is try to get things to work.” Luke pointed at the chip. “Now that is the coalition coming knocking. They are done giving you second chances.”

“What do you mean by that?”

Luke gawked at her; had she not heard what Crowley surely had explained to her over the last few years? Luke had dealt with enough coalition goons; he had to have made it clear they would take the farm and send her to a camp to learn a new skill, then, if she managed to master it, send her somewhere that new skill could be used.

It took Morel a few minutes to grasp the gravity of what Luke explained, but eventually, the look on her face changed as she understood what the coalition had planned. With each detail he shared about the long and painful process of selling her farm for scraps, she appeared more and more distraught.

The walls were closing in, and the piper was coming to take his dues. As was the reality of existence within the coalition. You were a productive cog in its war machine, or you were replaced.

“But what about my bunnies and painting---my home,” Morel asked, sniffling.

He did not directly tell Morel the reality of a coalition castigation in any further detail. Telling Morel they would harvest her rabbits for food and demolish the farm and her belongings to clear the way for a new government building was salt in the wound she did not need. Instead of saying it, Luke shook his head and apologized.

Morel’s massive hands shot out and grabbed Luke’s shoulders, squeezing them with such force he thought they might snap out of place. She shook him wildly while crying her eyes out. “Why would they do this? I’ve been trying!”

Luke attempted to calm Morel down and have her relax, but that was a fruitless effort. She grabbed him in a tight, soul-crushing hug, smearing paint from her apron across his chest as he was buried within her bountiful chest.

At the same time, as if rain was accosting him, droplets of her sorrow fell and pattered into his hair, soaking his scalp almost instantly.

She cried for so long that Luke did not think she could have any more tears left. But then, before he knew it, Morel sucked in a deep breath, exhaled, and repeated her wails of agony.

She bawled about her bunnies, her lifelong home, and all her friends here in Grey Rock.

The reality of Luke’s explanation of what the coalition was planning on doing here seemingly broke the woman. Luke had not planned on upsetting her this much. His intention in telling her this was simply to discuss how they would need to work hard and prove the farm was viable.

Luke tentatively reached up, hugged her waist, and tried to reassure her. “It’s alright Morel. You’re not going anywhere.”

“Sug, you can’t promise me tha—aa-aa-t” Morel clung to him tighter, leading to him nearly suffocating within her furry cleavage. The scent of roasted almonds poured from her bosom, causing Luke’s head to spin.

As she thrashed with him locked tightly in her cushioned vault, it became evident to Luke that calming Morel down on his time would be as effective as pushing water uphill with a rake. Instead of fighting the Sisyphean undertaking Luke surrendered to her will.

He reached up further and caressed her back, doing his best to assure her that everything would be alright. Each gentle pat against her broad back released more of her sorrow over the news. Calming the beast of a woman was not a short thing; Luke could not put a time on it, but knew the sun had fallen several degrees by the time Morel released him, setting him back down.

They looked into each other’s eyes while Luke held one of her hands in his, his thumb caressing the back. Morel’s eyes were puffy and red, remnant tears streaking down her cheeks.

“You alright?” Luke asked, thumbing her cheek clean.

Morel nodded and muttered a confirmation, not daring to speak higher than a whisper for the moment, afraid she would cry yet again. She could almost hear her father telling her to be big and strong; He had always demanded she be a woman who could stand tall, pull herself up by her bootstraps, and tackle anything life threw at her head on.

“Come on,” Luke said, gently tugging at her arm and guiding her forward.

The large alien's head hung low as the human guided her down the steps. Each creaked beneath her weight. Whereas Luke was absolutely silent.

Once down in the living room, Luke guided Morel to have her sit on the sofa, the padded leather welcoming her heavy frame.

“Just wait here,” Luke said, gesturing at her with open palms. “I will be right back.”

Morel felt a pang of guilt in her chest when she saw Luke. She had ruined his shirt with paint stains; massive dollops of neon color crisscrossed the new grey button-up, causing it to look like someone had drunkenly attempted tie-dye.

Once Luke had left, Morel’s mind echoed with memories of her childhood. Whenever she had been caught doing something wrong, or had failed a test at school, he would sit her down on that very couch and take his time to pass on breaths of wisdom.

With slow, meticulous coaching, Kurkel would ensure Morel understood what she had failed to do or had done wrong and encouraged her to think about the event with a critical mind. He would stay with her no matter how much she cried, became frustrated, or threw a fit.

Kurkel was a bastion of stone, unflappable and unyielding.

Eventually, Morel would have figured out how to solve the issue. He had not given her the answers---no, no, doing so would have made Morel little more than a lecherous leech. Kurkel had taught Morel the vital lesson of how to think, how to learn; a skill Morel would be flexing soon.

A thin smile drew upon her lips. Thinking of those happy times with her father, and how patient he was with her. But those memories did not remain jubilant for long. The sharp jab of that little chip Crowley had given Luke against her skin flung her forward into her dreadful reality.

The several years she had spent running the farm were all a preamble to this reality. The ending stretch was here, the do-or-die run. She had known it was coming; Morel had just hoped that the coalition would have given her the grace to sell it off once her reminiscence of her childhood was done.

But Luke had explained to her the grim reality of the fate she stared down the barrel of.

Luke eventually returned, and unlike her father in the past, who had her failures and was ready to teach her everything she had done wrong, Luke held an offering, a gift that made her heart flutter, and her strife feel more manageable.

Perched carefully atop a platter, Luke carried a mug for him and one for her that was comparatively comically large along with a small mountain of confectionary cakes out of the pantry.

Steam wafted out of the mugs and swirled around the small white and black morsels. The vapor clung to the surface like clouds against a pinewood mountainside.

As Luke placed the platter before her, the teabag tags swayed lazily. The overwhelming scent of the floral tea pressed into Morel, infusing her with the serenity of a summer day, just as the swirling tealeaves infused flavor into the water.

Luke said nothing as he initially sat down. He simply picked up his mug and sipped while flicking through his data slate, arranging all the mental notes he had into a clear, delineated list. He peered up from his screen at Morel and saw the look of confusion intermixed with the slump in her posture.

“Go ahead, it’s just tea,” Luke lifted his chin.

“Why?” Morel reached out and tentatively touched the mug's handle, not grasping it until Luke answered her.

“Tea always helps me relax when I’m upset. So I figured… You know,” Luke’s cheeks reddened as he quickly glanced back to the screen. “You shouldn’t be sad,” he finished under his breath so Morel could not hear.

As Morel took her first sip of the tea, a calming wave washed over her. Comfort covered her like a blanket. For the first time in a long time, Morel did not feel all alone. The gift of tea was nothing of great monetary value, but it still was her first real glimpse at the man who, over the last day and a half, had been guarded.

She peered through the steam and could not help but admire the focus in Luke’s tawny eyes. They were sharp and absolutely dedicated to the task at hand. Seeing that imper­turbable wall roused a slight glimmer of hope in her mind's eyes.

So long as he was here at Golden Fields, everything would work out.

Morel ate and drank tea for almost an hour; half of the mountain of sweets had vanished. Luke had not lost focus the entire time, the only break in his focus was him asking to see the chip. He installed it into his data slate, hummed, highlighted a few lines, and then went back to his plans.

As he continued to work, she went to top off their drinks. Instead of returning to her place across the coffee table, she handed him his teacup and sat down beside him. So close that her plump thigh enveloped his. Luke, in such a deep focus, did not react to the proximity like he had earlier that day.

A change in attitude, Morel picked up on instantly. The juxtaposition from this morning was mind-boggling. He had run away from her like she was a carrier of the Nerela plague. But when she was crying, Luke consoled her and even shared his own ritual to relax once she had calmed.

What was the cause of such a change? Was he really just here because of work? Or was something else going on? And if that was the case, why did Luke treat her like a plague bearer? She had so many questions in her mind, but based on how Luke had been so far, she knew prying into details about him too quickly would have him running like a rabbit to a burrow.

But despite knowing that Luke would not give her a straight answer for now, she could still try to acclimate him to her and how she expresses comfort and closeness, and hopefully see that adorable blush on his face again.

“So what are you planning?” Morel asked, leaning over his shoulder, her hot breath wafting across his ear, with the scent of roasted almonds overpowering the lingering floral tea odor.

Luke completely froze as a shudder violently rolled through his body. For a few moments, he sputtered as his tongue was tied in knots while he attempted to explain to Morel what he had found out and planned. His hand trembling like he had been on a ten day bender.

The only thing that prompted his response was the same woman who had an insurmountable effect on him.

“Come on, sweet thing. Let’s figure this out,” Morel purred, as her large hand ghosted over his shoulder.

“I…I.. Think I have a solution to buy us some time,” Luke managed to drag out of himself. He attempted to squirm away a bit from Morel, but her firm hand held him close to her body, not allowing him even a nanometer of separation.

One voice in his head berated him for enjoying the skinship, her voice, her caress---and her soothing existence. Despite the demons' cutting words, he ignored them. Morel needed him right now, and her being so touchy-feely was something he would adapt to, like it or not.

“Oh, please tell me what I have to do,” Morel said.

“Ok, so here is the deal---” Luke resumed. “We can still convert the farm over to being an orchard, but we are going to have to really start putting in work in other areas, and keep our ducks in a row when it comes to the coalition. But don’t worry about that part, I can handle the correspondence.”

“What do we have to do first?” Morel asked.

“Well, first things first, I have to finish testing most of the soil in plots. We will have to irrigate and get more saplings than I have ever seen.” Luke said, pulling up a map of the property on his data slate.

The map showed the farm from a satellite view, outlined the areas he had tested, indicated the types of apples and other trees to plant, and even suggested where the future irrigation systems could go. Luke had even created hyperlinks to where many of the tools and equipment needed for the task could be purchased.

“Do we have the money for that?” Morel asked.

“Not exactly, so a lot of it we will just have to do ourselves, digging trenches, planting saplings and other manual labor tasks. That way we can use what little money the farm has left to build a pump house, buy saplings, and a few other things.”

“Can we do that with two people?” Morel questioned, nervous about the dozens of miles of irrigation piping that would have to be dug.

“Not likely. That’s where I was actually going to ask you for help.”

Morel squeezed Luke a bit tighter, making his heart race. “What do you need me to do?”

“Can you find some people who will volunteer to help? You are the local and have connections. If I asked, most would likely tell me to pound sand.” Luke said he wasn't exactly sure if that statement was true because of how kind the Grey Rock inhabitants seemed, but he was playing it safe.

Morel pondered for a few moments, looking over the list Luke had created and considering whom she could ask for help with what. Brukus could help with digging trenches; he owned a backhoe. Hank would be more than happy to assist with little things; he might be an older man, but he lives like a man half his age.

There were a few others in town whom she could ask. Some are friends, others acquaintances from years ago, but they would still likely be willing to lend a bit of a hand.

“I think I could get a few people. But they are going to be planting as well.” Morel said.

“We can take what we can get. All we have to do, according to Crowley's instructions, is show proof of production capability. If we get the trees in the ground, we should be good. Even if the harvest this year only barely covers the tithe.”

“Really?” Morel said hopefully.

“Yeah,” Luke replied, looking back up at Morel. She stared back, the same bright, jubilant essence of life he had seen in her glowing brighter than ever.

They spoke a bit more that night about what had to be done, and by the end of it, they had a solid plan. They were both on the same page and knew exactly what they would be doing tomorrow—hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder.

""Heh, he was just like I thought "" *Sonic murmured to himself as he casually walked onwards, looking up at the newly drawn night sky above, stars glittering.* ""A kind and heroic hedgehog... Slipstream The Hedgehog.""

*There was a small snicker at the end of those words. Thinking back to the wind rushing through his quills from all around the world was incredible. Such a fun adventure. Today was fun, really fun. And it'll be tomorrow soon enough.*

""Another day, another adventure-""

***FWASH!***

""Huh?"" *Sonic suddenly turned his head at the odd noise. Quickly spying the figure who'd made it. A teleporting hedgehog.* ""Shadow?! What-""

""I was watching your little race around the world today*,"" *[See [last issue!](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfMobiusMerged/s/kGNFT8PAYP) Shadow was watching!]* ""You've surprised me yet again, blue hedgehog.""

""Hah! What? Did ya really think I'd lose there for a moment?"" *Sonic gave a cocky smirk to his black and red faker.* ""I know he got a pretty big lead there but c'mon you know me.  Even if the odds are against me I can always pull out a win-""

""I didn't know you had the heart to do something so **cruel**,"" *Shadow stated as bluntly as usual, crossing his arms.*

""...?"" *Sonic stared in confusion for a moment, tilting his head a bit.* ""Man you are not making any sense as of recently... What are you talking about?""

""I'm talking about all the **false hope** you *inspired* for that kid. But it was the only thing you could really do,"" *Shadow explained, somewhat cold but almost somber as he continued.* ""He hates himself to such an extent he figured death was a more suitable fate, and you did your best convincing him out of that. But his dream is impossible, his life's dedication will ultimately not bear fruit. Yet you still encouraged him anyway so he would not give up on life in spite of that fact. Slipstream will **never** beat you in a race-""

***""Says who?""***

*Sonic cut Shadow off simply. Staring at the faker. Almost a glare but not quite. He wasn't angry, no, it was more like he was challenging everything just said. Arms similarly crossed and angled right at one another. It made the Ultimate Life Form tilt his head back a bit. Before trying to retort with his own challenge.*

""Says everything blue hedgehog. While I wasn't actively following both of you around the entire world my own senses are more than enough proof. He simply cannot do it,"" *Shadow's eyes narrowed.* ""The scarfed hedgehog is not fast enough-""

""Yet. He's not fast enough, **yet**,"" *Sonic  said, rudely pointing a figure at his opponent in this debate.* ""Just because he's a little behind doesn't mean he can't catch up. I mean, that's kinda his thing! I dunno why your so determined that he can't-""

""And I don't know why you're so determined he can,"" *Shadow scoffed, as he used his back hand to push Sonic's point away.* ""He could train for years and never see any more progress. And even if he did progress, speed is your forte, your pride, your greatest ability. It would be like saying he could beat me at Chaos Control!""

""Oh now I see the problem. Are you maybe projecting a bit there Shadow? Don't worry I'll still have enough time to prove you're slower than me, faker!"" *Sonic proceeded to laugh at his own joke before turning back around to look at the sky.* ""Actually I don't know why you're arguing so much, don't you always relish a chance to prove your *''superiority''*? And you haven't given up yet, you never would. So why should he?""

""I-..."" *Shadow stopped for a moment... Clenching his fingers on his arm a bit. There was no real argument he could make. So instead he just sighed and continued.* ""I am the Ultimate Lifeform, so of course I don't give up because I know what I'm capable of, including defeating you. And so do you with your powers Fastest Thing Alive. So I still don't understand your belief that he can come to compete with us...""

*Shadow stared at the blue hedgehog for a moment before finally letting out the final thought.*

***""Do you WANT him to beat you?""***

""...""

*Sonic didn't reply at first, he just continued staring at the stars above. He tapped his foot on the ground and raised a hand to tap on his muzzle. A shooting star flew by overhead. And then the hedgehog smiled before glancing back at Shadow. Gesturing at the sky.*

""Y'know I actually had a *secret* little talk with the kid after the race a little bit ago, just asked him a few questions about who he was and where he came from. He has sparked my curiosity, that's for sure!"" *Sonic said with a soft warming smile.* ""And there's a reason why we both call him **kid**, robotic hedgehog or not. He's still pretty young.""

*Sonic casually stroked back his own long quills a bit. Showcasing just how small Slipstream's were in comparison. And then tapping on his forehead where the fur tufts should be.*

""And that means there's room to grow, especially as he gets older... My little brother already showed me that! Heh, maybe I should tell Tails just how proud of him I am when I see him next,"" *Sonic said cheerfully as he thought back... Seemingly wiping his face a bit. Proud. ""He really did outpace me a little bit huh?""*

*Shadow did not speak... This was a side of the blue hedgehog he was sort of unfamiliar with. Then his ear twitched. He turned and looked behind him once more at the stars above and then at a tree behind them which had rustled. Staring, before noting something, then turning back to Sonic. Looking a little more... Relaxed?*

""Fine, you've caught my interest as well. Finish your point, then answer my question,"" *Shadow stated a bit gruff, although he did seem to be listening.* ""Just what are you getting at Sonic?""

""Heh, I guess my point or whatever I'm saying is... Don't count him or anybody else out? Amy, Tails, Knucklehead, you Shadow, Blaze, Silver, Tangle, Whisper, and Slipstream and all the other friends and people I've met across the world and even on others!"" *Sonic stated, spreading his arms to the sky above.* ""They've all gotten better and learned new things too. It's just like he said, every mistake just leads to a new starting line you know? Hahaha!""

*Sonic's laughter echoed far into the night sky, somehow still not done yet.*

""Growing up is just another part of living life, it's experiencing new things and stuff as we develop and get older. Yeah it's kinda weird at first, especially as you begin to see others grow up too, but trust me you get the hang of it. None of that means losing who you are, it just means you begin to express it a lot more. That's what really changes I think. ***And I'm happy to have helped Tails, Slipstream, and all my fans around the world grow up a bit better.""***

[*Like A Whirlwind*](https://youtu.be/ZVHsOEZX1kU?si=XPrS52KylyPjAdaH) *had swept through, Sonic looked happier than ever before. Quickly rubbing his nose and stretching his glove a bit. Like readying once more for a run as he smirks with pride.*

""So do I want him to beat me...? You know what, yeah! It sounds fun to have some new competition to push me to grow even more too! Hahahahaha!"" *Sonic almost started laughing almost uncontrollably.* ""But don't get me wrong, I'm definitely not going down easy! And even if he does beat me well then... We'll celebrate, have fun, let the kid have his day, and then soon enough I'll challenge him to another rematch! ***And we'll keep pushing each other to the limit as we run till either one of us comes out on top or till our legs give out! Haha!""***

*Maybe some could call it maniacal laughter. Or that Sonic's just in it for the thrill... and hey maybe they're not wrong! But at the end of the day he's in it for the adventure. And all of this is just one more grand adventure!*

""Hehehehe! That put it into perspective for ya Shadow..."" *Sonic says as he turns around, then glances at the same tree.* ""And you too Slipstream?""

**Thunk!** *Said tree suddenly shakes a bit as the surprised hedgehog in hiding makes some accidental noise. Nervously he pokes his head out... Shadow doesn't react, it seems he noticed him earlier. Instead he looks at Sonic and begins to nod.*

""Yes... I'm surprised again blue hedgehog, seems I misunderstood you a bit,"" *Shadow says, although he seems to be smiling a little bit behind the gruff demeanor.* ""You're even crazier than I thought.""

""Pfft- Ha!"" *Sonic took that with pride, tilting his head at his ''successor''. No words, just a glance. And there seemed to be a mutual understanding.*

""Yeah... and sorry for eaves dropping! I didn't mean to, I just uhm I forgot to..."" *Slipstream starts a bit behind the tree for a moment but then he pushes himself to walk out and towards the two, still a fair distance behind but on the same field.* ""Thank you Sonic, I forgot to say this earlier but... I'm really glad I met you, and everything you've said means a lot to me.""

""Heh, you're welcome kid,"" *Sonic said, exchanging thumbs ups once more.* ""And now that you know I'm looking forward to it, make sure you do your best alright?""

""I... I already was but now, I'll do even better!"" *Slipstream retorted with a fist pump.* ""I... I don't think I did as good as I could last time. Not really sure, but- But I'm going to do even better!""

""Heh, keep at it kid. Because a major step to doing anything is believing you can, not that you have to. It's part of why I'm able to defeat Egghead so many times,"" *Sonic comments.* ""No matter what comes my way, I'm confident I can do my best to save the day.""

""So what you're saying is your cockiness is justifiable?"" *Shadow scoffs before letting out a chuckle.* ""Now who's coping?""

""Hey! I'll make you eat those words!""

""Heh heh,"" *Slipstream giggled at the two's bickering before nodding...* ""Thank you again. I'll try to figure that out, even if confidence is kinda tough for me... and even if I don't manage to beat you as long as I live I'm going to do my best as a Hero regardless! I'll make my own way as I enjoy my life. And be your successor in one way or another no matter What Comes Next!""

*The blue and black hedgehog both blinked at that. Seemingly surprised before looking at each other. Slipstream however looked a little confused that they'd gone silent.*

*""Did I say something wrong...?""*

""Heh, nah kid don't worry about it,"" *Sonic waved him off before leaning towards Shadow to ragebait.* *""If he keeps up this pace he can outspeed you soon slowpoke.""*

*""Tch,"" Shadow glared back. ""If anyone dares to try then it will be in a fight. A race only tests so much. A duel tests all.""*

*""Yeah, okay grim-hog,"" *Sonic said with a chuckle before glancing at the confused Slipstream.* ""I dunno about you guys but I'm hungry! Wanna go grab a bite?""

""Sonic he's a robot, even if he can form a mouth he can't-""

**""I/He can eat don't question it,""** *Both replied at the same time.*

""I... Fine,"" *Shadow commented with an eye roll.* ""I suppose I can spare time for a bite, I'm not paying for either of you however.""

""Hmm, how about we race to see who pays? Last one there foots the bill,"" *Sonic said already getting into a racing position.* ""Hope you both brought wallets!""

""Are you being... Fine, I'll embarrass you and order twice as much coffee beans,"" *Shadow commented as got down as well, ready to skate.*

*Slipstream did not have a wallet... Nor was he ever keen to turn down a race. And so he got into position too.*

*""What happens if I win this one?"" He muttered his thoughts aloud by accident. ""I'm already recharged-""*

""I'll buy you a sundae! I'm still a little tired so no title taking,"" *Sonic commented.* ""Which also gives Shadow a chance to win. Ha!""

""Just for that I'm ramming you into the nearest hillside once we start,"" *Shadow retorted.*

""Wait we're fighting-"" *Slipstream looked surprised... ~~Maybe if he lets Shadow and Sonic take each other out of the race he won't go broke-~~*

""Yeah this Faker loves fighting,"" *Sonic snickered.* ""But we'll still have fun.""

""Enough! Starting in three..."" *Shadow stated as they all got ready to boost.*

""Two..."" *Sonic commented, eyes narrowed forward.*

""One..."" *Slipstream did his best to lock in.*

***""GO!""***

# ***WHOOOOOOOSH!***

*And so the three hedgehogs blasted off! Heading towards whatever goal lies ahead. And then after that there'll be another starting line to go again...*

*So as Sonic and Shadow duke it out! Air shoes blazing with chaos energy and power sneakers dashing through the wind. Slipstream's new kicks do their best to keep up, trailing after both. And taking every opportunity to over take and pass them, and if there's not a chance then he'll make his own way. So whoever wins, they're absolutely doing their best.*

***No matter what comes next!***

1p7gy4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1p7gy4q/tablet_stand_for_traveling_what_features_to_look/,Tablet stand for traveling: what features to look for?,"When you're traveling, having a tablet stand can make your life so much easier. Whether you're on a long flight, staying in a hotel, or working remotely from a coffee shop, the right stand keeps your tablet at the perfect angle for watching movies, video calls, or getting work done.

But not all tablet stands work well for travel. You need something that won't take up half your suitcase or break after one trip. Here's what you should look for when picking a travel tablet stand.

**Lightweight and Portable**

The biggest thing is weight. You don't want to carry around a heavy stand that adds extra pounds to your luggage. Look for stands made from aluminum or lightweight plastic. These materials keep things sturdy without weighing you down. The best travel stands fold flat or collapse into a compact size that fits easily in your backpack or carry-on bag.

**Adjustable Angles**

Different situations need different viewing angles. When you're watching a show, you want one angle. When you're typing or doing video calls, you need another. A good adjustable stand lets you change the angle quickly. Multi-position stands give you flexibility no matter where you are.

**Stable and Non-Slip**

Nothing's worse than your tablet constantly falling over. Look for stands with rubber grips or silicone pads on the bottom. These keep the stand from sliding around on tables, especially on planes or trains where there's movement. The holding arms should also have padding so they don't scratch your tablet screen.

**Works with Your Case**

Many people keep protective cases on their tablets while traveling. Make sure the stand you choose has wide enough arms or holders to fit your tablet even with a case on. Otherwise, you'll waste time taking the case off and putting it back on.

**Durable Build Quality**

Travel means your gear gets bumped around. Cheap stands with weak hinges break quickly. Look for stands with strong joints and solid construction. Metal stands usually last longer than all-plastic ones.

You can check out different [portable tablet stands here](https://athomewave.com/tablet-stand) to see what features work best for your travel needs.

**Compatibility with Different Devices**

Some stands only work with specific tablet sizes. If you have multiple devices or might upgrade later, get a universal stand that adjusts to different widths. This saves you from buying a new stand every time you get a new device.

**Easy Setup**

When you're tired from traveling, you don't want to mess with complicated setup. The best travel stands open up in seconds without tools or confusing instructions. One-piece designs or simple fold-out styles work great.

**Ventilation**

If you use your tablet for extended periods, it can heat up. Stands with open backs or ventilation holes help with airflow and keep your device from overheating during long movie marathons or work sessions.

Finding the right tablet stand makes traveling with your device much more comfortable. Whether you're catching up on shows during a layover or joining meetings from your hotel room, a quality stand gives you hands-free convenience wherever you go. Take a look at [travel-friendly options](https://athomewave.com/tablet-stand) that combine portability with solid performance, and you'll wonder how you ever traveled without one.",1,1764185169.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

I am currently living in a town with a pretty poor job market and it took me two months to find my current gig. I assistant manage a restaurant for $20/hr and consistently do odd jobs to keep the bills paid. My employers won’t give me more than 36hrs per week, and my biweekly paycheck is usually 900-1,000 dollars. I make roughly 2,100 per month (~24,000/yr). 

Each month, my rolling expenses like rent, student loans, utilities, internet, phone, etc are about 1,100/mo, so I have about $900 per month for all other spending like groceries, gas, or health expenses. 
 
I’m looking for a reliable budget for that $900/mo that will allow me to save anything at all. In the past, I’ve tried to budget for only one tank of gas per month ($60) and spent no more than $100 per month on my groceries and $70 per month on my pets. With recent inflation, I’ve found that I’ve needed to spend upwards of $300 per month to afford groceries. I do not spend any money on clothes, fun items, makeup, coffee, alcohol etc. I mend clothes in my house LOL. With regular car maintenance, doctors visits, medicine, and veterinary visits, I have not been able to save more than the $200 I have now between paychecks. I am considering moving back home with my parents (last resort), picking up a second job, or selling my things. 

I am surviving alright at the moment, but it has been months since I could eat in a restaurant, go out with friends, or do something nice for myself without MAJOR guilt and regret, and it’s a pretty depressing way to live. I am also no closer to affording to fix my car, which I need to get to and from work. Any advice? ",1,1764185040.0,budgetingforbeginners,0,1.0,False

In my case, moderation never works. It's just a slippery slope.

My body continues to want the milk, eggs, meat, etc. Omni or even vegetarian foods are too addicting to me. I don't get satiated well with them either.

The only solution is just cutting it all out point blank. No ""It's only one meal"" or ""It's just a cup of coffee/a donut/a piece of cake/a party"", etc. If I give in, I'll end up on the wagon again.",1,1764184983.0,BingeEatingDisorder,2,0.67,False

After years of lurking on this sub and dreaming about it, I finally made the jump: I moved into my converted Ford Transit last week and officially started full-time vanlife. I wanted to share a few things that totally surprised me so far, maybe it’ll help someone else who’s about to start!

 1. The freedom hits *hard*  
I knew vanlife would feel freeing, but waking up next to a lake on Monday morning instead of an alarm clock? Unreal. I didn’t realize how quickly the stress of my old routine would melt off.

 2. Something *will* break immediately  
Day 2: my sink pump decided it didn’t want to pump anymore. Luckily it was a simple fix, but wow, nothing humbles you like troubleshooting plumbing in a grocery store parking lot.

 3. Parking anxiety is real, but fades fast  
The first night I barely slept because I was convinced I’d get “the knock.” By night three, I was out like a rock. Having a little rotation of safe spots has made a *huge* difference.

 4. Temperature control is an art  
I have insulation, a Maxxair fan, and blackout covers, still figuring out the perfect combo. Any tips for keeping things cool without draining the battery?

 5. Morning routines hit different  
Making coffee with the back doors open is my new religion.

Overall, I’m loving it, even the chaotic parts. If you’ve got advice for a brand-new full-timer, especially around stealth parking and power management, I’d love to hear it!

1p7guf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p7guf9/poor_espresso_quality_issues_breville_bambino/,Poor Espresso Quality Issues [Breville Bambino + Baratza Encore],"Hi all,

I am very new to the espresso game, having purchased my first espresso machine, the bambino, about 4 weeks ago now. I have done a lot of experimenting and researching in that time. I am experiencing pretty poor results up until this stage. Obviously some of that is just down to experience and “time on the water” so to speak, but it seems like I might actually be getting worse in some ways. Below I will outline the equipment I am using, my process, and things I have attempted to change. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. 

Machine: Breville Bambino 
Grinder: Baratza Encore
Precise scale
Normcore spring tamper
IMS 18-22g basket
Wdt tool
Dosing funnel 

I am using both the stock portafilter as well as a Normcore bottomless portafilter
49th Parallel espresso beans (3-6 weeks from roast date

My usual process is:
18g beans > sprits of water > grind at setting 7 > wdt > tamp (this usually has the edge of the tamper making contact with the rim of the portafilter)

I preheat my machine by running one empty double shot through it and then running the wand for approximately 8-10 seconds. 

When I use the preprogrammed double shot button I am getting approximately 36-38g of coffee in 18-20 seconds from when I press the button. 

When I run the machine manually I usually get 36-41g of coffee in about 19-20 seconds with 8 second pre infusion (8 second button hold). 

I usually then do a 2-1 water to coffee ratio to make a mini americano beverage. 

Overall my espresso comes out very sour most of the time, which I know means it’s under extracted. I have attempted to WDT longer, Tamp harder, and play with grind settings. If I grind on less than setting 7 on the machine the espresso shot comes out silty. When using the bottomless portafilter my coffee sprays everywhere, produces a much larger amount 45+g and is overall a disaster so I have put that on the back burner for now. 

I am a long term espresso drinker - usually dark roast - and am confident this isn’t a “you just don’t like those beans/this type of coffee” issue. 

It feels like I have attempted a lot of the easy fixes to the process and haven’t seen much improvement. 

Any and all thoughts would be helpful. 

Thanks a lot!

Naturally I took the piss but he was dead serious! He's not odd or mad so I was a bit shocked. Said he was there all his life and he said his parents said he was there when they bought the house in the 80s.. he said u would hear him walking around at night. He opens and closes doors. Only once said he was aggressive and fired a coffee jar off the counter when the family suggested getting someone to get rid of him.. said it gets really cold in the room if he comes in..

I asked how do you know it's a man and he told me him and his two younger brothers used a ouiji board and he chatted back, said he lived in the house before them but wouldnt answer much questions..

I said that the house must not have good ventilation and to check it for carbon monoxide and that but he said there's a vent in most bedrooms and his mother has the windows open nearly every day. Assured me that the ghost is real.

Here's where it went worse. At lunch, two of his friend from work said they have been in the house and they have felt it, heard the footsteps and seen the doors opening and closing. One said he wouldn't ever go back as it freaked him the fuck out. All of them were dead serious. I assumed they were taking the piss but when the others joined in the two friends fought tooth and nail that it was real.

# The Basics: How 7-OH Extracts Work

Plant-only 7-hydroxymitragynine isolates are made by massive-scale chromatography on high-mitragynine leaf, followed by multiple recrystallizations. A single gram of lab-grade natural 7-OH would cost well over $3,000, and there are currently zero retail vendors selling pure.

Every commercial product claiming >5% 7-OH is a semi-synthetic, produced by oxidation of mitragynine with reagents like Oxone or SeO₂. Oxidation leaves traces of heavy metals, residual solvents, or adulterants like tramadol/fentanyl analogs, making lab testing all the more important.

Quality 7-OH is ultimately determined by final purity, absence of heavy metals/solvents/adulterants, and price. Below is a ranked list based on these metrics.

# What The Vendors Told Me

I emailed every major player to try and get their view on what makes for a good product and these were the real, unfiltered responses.

[LMTLSS](https://lmtlsstabs.myshopify.com?sca_ref=9350453.va5ffD87w0)  
“Hey brother! We blend a darker 74% active with a super-clean 94+% salt-based active – the combo gives the best user experience we’ve ever seen. Then we add MIT to every single tablet because the synergy is insane. Most companies don’t do that, but it’s what separates us. Same-day shipping every day, obsessive support, and we’re here for the long haul.”

[That One Place](https://thatotherplacegj.com/product/10mg-economy-7-oh-tablets-v1-ohmsicle/)  
“In-house GMP facility, NSF-certified equipment, we press our own tabs so you know exactly what’s inside. Every extract gets 2–3 rounds of testing including Murray Brown (extended solvent panels). We send everything to an experienced test group before release – if it’s underwhelming or solvents are high, we reject the batch or price it honestly. We’re the only ones I know using thermal-protected packaging because 7-OH hates heat. No affiliate program on purpose – we want every review to stay 100% real.”

[Stardust Kratom](https://stardustkratom.com/product/buy-best-20mg-7ohm-tablets/)  
“Triple testing on everything: in-house by manufacturer → third-party → our own third-party. We use proper HPLCDAD liquid chromatography, not the cheap VWDAD that most of the industry relies on from SD Farms. Full chromatograms are on every product page.”

[Max 7OH ](https://max7oh.com/23mg-7-oh-capsules-10count)  
“We only sell 7-OH extracts. The high values come from natural mitragynine conversion. I’m a tiny operation right now, no affiliate setup yet, but open to coupon codes so we can both track sales.”

[7HydroxyRaw ](https://rawmit.com/products/lil-nans-banana-cream-pie?variant=50102742286633)  
“Every single product is third-party tested for potency, consistency, and safety. Labs are on the product pages. No affiliate spots open right now, but I’ll keep you in mind.”

[LMTLSS](https://lmtlsstabs.myshopify.com?sca_ref=9350453.va5ffD87w0) and [That One Place](https://thatotherplacegj.com/product/10mg-economy-7-oh-tablets-v1-ohmsicle/) blew everyone else away with how open and detailed they were. [Stardust ](https://stardustkratom.com/product/buy-best-20mg-7ohm-tablets/)is close behind on the testing side. The rest were polite, but these five actually gave answers that built trust.

# Watch List (Still Good)

7. A traditional ""Ryokan"" (Japanese inn) hallway during autumn. Sliding shoji doors on the left, polished wooden floor reflecting the garden outside. The garden is visible through the open veranda, showing ""Momiji"" (red maple leaves) falling into a stone water basin (""Tsukubai""). Atmosphere is ""Wabi-sabi""—quiet, rustic, and impermanent. Soft, natural light filtering through paper screens.

8. Style: Modern superhero comic book panel. Character: ""Neon-Valkyrie"" (a tall woman with platinum blonde braided hair, wearing silver armor with glowing blue runes #00BFFF). Action: She is slamming a glowing energy hammer into the ground, creating a shockwave that cracks the pavement. Debris is flying towards the viewer.

1. The Book: In the center is a massive, ancient leather-bound spellbook open to page 42. The pages are yellowed parchment with tattered edges. The text on the page is legible black ink in a gothic font reading ""THE ETERNAL FLAME"". There is a detailed illustration of a dragon on the right page.
2. The Potion: To the left of the book is a spherical glass flask containing a bubbling liquid. The liquid is a viscous purple #800080. Inside the liquid, a tiny, fully detailed ship is floating. The glass has condensation droplets on the outside.
3. The Artifacts: To the right of the book lies a solid gold pocket watch with a cracked face, gears spilling out. Beside it is a raven’s skull with a ruby gem set in the eye socket.
4. The Environment: The desk surface is dark oak wood with deep scratches and burn marks. Cobwebs connect the flask to the book. Dust motes are dancing in the light beams.

REVIEW

The model has potential; it follows the prompts really closely and accurately, especially the hex code colors. Maybe Style Lora and other fine-tunes will really push it to the limits. I have compared some prompts with the Qwen base model, and I think the prompt adherence is much higher in Flux 2. I will leave the quality and artistic judgment to the viewer's choice.  
I don't want to comment on prompt time, steps, or other details because I am more interested in the Final results. Even if it takes a little extra time, quality matters more than quantity.",5,1764184668.0,StableDiffusion,4,0.86,False

I’ve been crushing on this guy from work for a while now. We’ve been chatting here and there—nothing serious, just the usual ‘Hi, how was your day?’ kind of stuff. After a couple of weeks, I finally worked up the nerve to ask him out for coffee. We decided to meet in the café downstairs from our office after work. I was actually really excited—like, giddy schoolgirl excited. I got there early, grabbed a table, and waited. And waited. And waited. After about 15 minutes, I started to wonder if he’d stood me up. I texted him, but no reply. I even asked a coworker if she’d seen him leave, and she said no. Then, out of sheer desperation, I did something I’m *so* embarrassed about—I called him. I was like, ‘Hey, it’s Ava. Are you coming? I’m down here waiting.’ His response? ‘UK, I thought you were someone else. I left already.’ I was mortified. Did I misread the whole thing? Was he just being polite when he said yes? I spent the whole evening replaying the conversation in my head, convinced I’d made a fool of myself. But then, an hour later, he called me back. Turns out, he *had* been looking for me—just in the wrong place. He thought I was waiting near his desk (which I wasn’t, because I was already downstairs). He’d left thinking I’d bailed, and when I called, he thought *I* was the one who’d stood *him* up. We ended up talking for a while, and it turned out he’s actually really sweet. He even apologized for the mix-up, and we’ve been texting more since. I still can’t believe how awkward that whole thing was, but at least it ended on a good note!

# Perseus’ Revelations 

Alex was sitting on the couch in their Brooklyn apartment, his laptop open to a spreadsheet that had just been validated by a 3,400-year-old demigod, and his entire worldview had been shattered, reassembled, and then set on fire for good measure. 

Perseus—the actual, mythological Perseus who'd slain Medusa and married Andromeda—had just confirmed everything. **Everything.** John was immortal, had been alive for millennia, was Alexander the Great (as a side gig), married to Merlin for 4,000 years, and friends with Lucifer and Death like they were his college drinking buddies. 

Alex felt vindicated, validated, and also vaguely insane—like he'd been arguing with reality for four months and reality had finally shrugged and said, ""Yeah, okay, you were right, here's your prize: more cosmic insanity."" 

His phone buzzed. Sarah had sent seventeen texts in the last three minutes, each one more unhinged than the last: 

**""GET PERSEUS'S AUTOGRAPH""**   
**""ASK HIM ABOUT THE MEDUSA THING""**   
**""IS ANDROMEDA HOT IN PERSON?""**   
**""STEAL HIS MEDALLION""**   
**""RECORD EVERYTHING""**   
**""I'M COMING TO BROOKLYN WITH A CAMERA CREW""** 

Alex ignored them all. He was too busy staring at Perseus, who was lounging on the couch like a Greek statue that had decided to take a beer break, munching cookies and radiating the kind of calm that came from being functionally indestructible for three millennia. 

""Okay,"" Alex said, his voice hoarse from the emotional rollercoaster of the last hour. ""You said something earlier that's been bugging me. You said I'm doing better than Dad's other roommates. You mentioned a guy who ended up in a psych ward."" 

Perseus's grin faltered slightly, like he'd just realized he'd stepped on a conversational landmine. ""Oh, uh, yeah. Tom. That was... not Dad's finest moment."" 

""Tell me,"" Alex demanded, leaning forward. ""Tell me about all of them. Every single roommate John's had. Because I need to know—am I about to crack? Is there a pattern here? Should I be worried?"" 

Perseus sighed, setting down his beer. ""Alright, but don't freak out. Most of Dad's roommates don't last long—not because Dad's dangerous, but because mortals can't handle the weirdness. You're actually doing **way** better than average."" 

# The Roommate Hall of Shame (and Fame) 

Perseus cracked his knuckles, settling in like a bard about to tell an epic saga—except this saga was about immortal roommate turnover and cosmic gaslighting. 

""Okay, let's start with the timeline. Dad's been doing the 'roommate' thing on and off since, like, the 1800s? Before that, he usually lived alone or with Mom. But he figured out that having a mortal around—someone **normal**—keeps him grounded. Reminds him what humanity's about. So every few decades, he picks a place, finds a roommate, and sees how long they last."" 

Alex's stomach churned. ""I'm a social experiment."" 

""You're ALL social experiments,"" Perseus said cheerfully. ""But you're Dad's favorite so far! That counts for something."" 

""That's not comforting."" 

""It should be,"" Perseus countered. ""Most don't make it past a month. You're at four months and counting. Let me tell you about the others."" 

*Roommate #1: Greg the Hippie (1970s)* 

Perseus leaned back, grinning at the memory. ""First one I know about was a dude named Greg in the '70s. Hippie type, big into peace and love and hallucinogens—which, in retrospect, was a bad match for living with Dad. Greg found Dad's Spartan helmet in the closet—real deal, from Thermopylae, complete with battle dents. Thought it was a sick vintage find."" 

""Did John tell him the truth?"" Alex asked. 

""Hell no,"" Perseus said, laughing. ""Dad said it was a 'Renaissance fair prop.' But then Greg overheard Dad and Mom talking about the Oracle of Delphi like it was a bad Yelp review, and he started getting paranoid. Thought he was on a bad trip. Packed his VW van, fled to a commune in Oregon, and never looked back."" 

""Is he okay?"" 

""Oh, yeah. Still there, growing kale, muttering about 'immortal vibes.' Dad sends him a Christmas card every year. Greg thinks it's a prank from the universe."" 

**Sheet: ""John's Previous Roommates""**   
New entry: *Greg (1970s) - Hippie, found Spartan helmet, overheard Oracle of Delphi talk, thought he was hallucinating, fled to Oregon commune. Still alive, grows kale, thinks John was a ""bad trip.""* 

*Roommate #2: Lisa the Punk Rocker (1980s)* 

""Next was Lisa,"" Perseus continued. ""Punk rocker, total badass. Lasted about six weeks. She saw Dad heal a stab wound from a bar fight—just popped his shoulder back into place, wound closed in seconds. Then she found his WWI medals and a letter from Churchill. Thought Dad was a government experiment, dyed her hair blue as a 'fuck you' to the system, and bolted to London."" 

""London?"" Alex asked. 

""Yeah, she runs a record shop in Camden now. Dad visits sometimes—she thinks he's Churchill's grandson or something. Never corrected her. She's happy, so he lets it slide."" 

**Sheet: ""John's Previous Roommates""**   
New entry: *Lisa (1980s) - Punk rocker, saw John heal stab wound instantly, found WWI medals + Churchill letter, thought he was government experiment, fled to London. Runs record shop in Camden, thinks John is Churchill's descendant.* 

*Roommate #3: Mike the Conspiracy Theorist (1990s)* 

Perseus's grin turned mischievous. ""Oh, Mike. This guy was a trip. Grad student, super into conspiracy theories—perfect storm, really. He caught Dad and Lucifer playing poker one night, with Mom dealing cards that **glowed**. Then Mike found Dad's Roman coins and a scroll signed by Julius Caesar. Dude started a conspiracy zine, got laughed out of academia, and ran to a cabin in Maine."" 

""Is he okay?"" 

""Depends on your definition of 'okay,'"" Perseus said. ""He still sends Dad postcards about 'the truth' and 'the illuminati.' Dad frames them. Thinks they're hilarious."" 

Alex buried his face in his hands. ""So I'm living the conspiracy theorist's dream and I didn't even start a zine."" 

""You made a spreadsheet,"" Perseus pointed out. ""Way more organized. Dad respects that."" 

**Sheet: ""John's Previous Roommates""**   
New entry: *Mike (1990s) - Conspiracy theorist grad student, saw John + Lucifer playing poker (Mom dealt glowing cards), found Roman coins + Julius Caesar scroll, started conspiracy zine, fled to Maine cabin. Still sends postcards about ""the truth.""* 

*Roommate #4: Tom the Psych Ward Guy (Early 2000s)* 

Perseus's expression darkened slightly, the first time Alex had seen him look anything other than cheerfully chaotic. ""And then there's Tom. Early 2000s. That one... Dad still feels bad about."" 

Alex's heart sank. ""What happened?"" 

""Tom was a nice guy,"" Perseus said quietly. ""Teacher, mid-30s, just needed cheap rent. But he was **thorough**. Found Dad's full 'prop' collection—sword, crown, a Babylonian idol that whispered when you got too close, ancient texts, the works. Overheard Dad and Mom joking about outwitting Anubis. And one night, he saw Morton—Death—show up for tea."" 

""Oh no,"" Alex whispered. 

""Yeah,"" Perseus said, grimacing. ""Tom tried to rationalize it—'coincidences,' 'props,' 'method actors'—but it broke him. Started screaming about gods and curses, said the apartment was 'a portal to the underworld.' Neighbors called the cops, he got committed. Spent two years in treatment."" 

Alex felt cold. ""And John just... let that happen?"" 

Perseus's jaw tightened. ""Dad tried to help. Visited him, offered to pay for better care, even had Mom try to adjust his memories—but Tom refused. Said he 'needed to remember the truth.' Eventually stabilized, but he won't talk to Dad anymore. Lives in Vermont now, teaches high school, avoids anything ancient or mythological. Dad sends money anonymously—college fund for Tom's kids, mortgage payments. Feels responsible."" 

Alex's throat tightened. ""That could've been me."" 

""But it's not,"" Perseus said firmly. ""You're different. Tom was fragile—nice guy, but couldn't handle cognitive dissonance. You? You made a **spreadsheet**. You documented, analyzed, built a case. That's scientist energy, not breakdown energy. Dad knew you'd be okay."" 

**Sheet: ""John's Previous Roommates""**   
New entry: *Tom (early 2000s) - Teacher, found full prop collection + Babylonian idol, overheard Anubis talk, saw Death visit, mental breakdown, committed 2 years. Now in Vermont, teaches high school, avoids mythology. John sends anonymous financial support, feels guilty.* 

*Roommates #5-8: The Quick Exits* 

""After Tom,"" Perseus continued, ""Dad was more careful. Picked roommates who seemed tougher, more adaptable. But most still bailed fast."" 

He counted on his fingers. ""There was Rachel—journalist, lasted three weeks. Found the locket with Mom's portrait from 1891, Googled the date, freaked out about 'time travel,' moved to Seattle. 

""Then Carlos—chef, lasted a month. Saw Dad cook a five-course meal in 20 minutes using techniques from ancient Rome. Thought Dad was a culinary spy, quit his job, opened a food truck. 

""Emma—lawyer, two weeks. Overheard Dad on the phone speaking fluent Sumerian. Thought it was a prank, sublet her room, moved back with her parents. 

""And Jake—bartender, lasted five days. Saw Dad's crown, asked if it was real, Dad said 'maybe,' Jake noped out that same night."" 

Alex laughed despite himself. ""Five days?"" 

""Five days,"" Perseus confirmed. ""Jake saw the crown and went, 'I'm not dying in a horror movie,' and left. Dad thought it was hilarious."" 

**Sheet: ""John's Previous Roommates""**   
New entries:   
*Rachel (journalist, 3 weeks) - Found Victorian locket, Googled date, thought ""time travel,"" fled to Seattle.*   
*Carlos (chef, 1 month) - Saw ancient Roman cooking techniques, thought John was ""culinary spy,"" opened food truck.*   
*Emma (lawyer, 2 weeks) - Heard John speaking Sumerian on phone, thought it was prank, moved home.*   
*Jake (bartender, 5 days) - Saw crown, asked if real, John said ""maybe,"" Jake fled same night.* 

# Alex's Existential Status Check 

Alex stared at his laptop, the spreadsheet now listing nine previous roommates—eight who fled, one who broke. And him. Number ten. The one who'd lasted four months, met a demigod, and was still (mostly) sane. 

""So,"" Alex said slowly, ""I'm the longest-lasting roommate who didn't end up institutionalized."" 

""By a mile,"" Perseus confirmed, grinning. ""Tom lasted three months before the breakdown. You're at four and you met **me**, Luce, Morton, and now you know the truth. That's legendary, man. Dad's genuinely impressed."" 

""Impressed,"" Alex repeated flatly. ""I've been gaslit for four months, and he's impressed."" 

""You **figured it out**,"" Perseus countered. ""Most roommates see weird stuff and convince themselves it's coincidence. You built evidence, cross-referenced, made a **color-coded spreadsheet**. You're like a detective who cracked a cold case from 2000 BCE. That's not gaslighting—that's Dad respecting your intelligence by making you work for it."" 

Alex wanted to argue, but there was a twisted logic to it. John hadn't lied—he'd just deflected, misdirected, and let Alex piece it together. It was infuriating, but also... kind of brilliant? 

""So what happens now?"" Alex asked. ""Do I get a prize? A medal? Therapy?"" 

Perseus laughed. ""You get to keep living here, knowing the truth. Most mortals don't get that. You're part of the inner circle now—me, Mom, Dad, the crew. That's rare. Also, Dad's tacos are even better when you know they're made by a guy who conquered Persia."" 

# The Deeper Question 

""But why?"" Alex asked, his voice quiet. ""Why does John need roommates? He's got Merlin, you, Lucifer, all these immortal friends. Why live with random mortals who keep running away?"" 

Perseus's expression softened, the playful demigod facade dropping for a moment. ""Because immortality's lonely, man. Dad's got us, yeah, but we're eternal too. We don't change, don't grow old, don't die. Mortals? You guys are temporary, but that's what makes you matter. You remind Dad why he sticks around, why humanity's worth protecting. Every roommate teaches him something—even the ones who bolt."" 

He leaned forward, his voice sincere. ""Greg taught him that paranoia kills curiosity. Lisa taught him that rebellion has its place. Mike taught him that truth-seekers need evidence, not mockery. Tom taught him that some people can't handle the weight of knowing. And you? You're teaching him that mortals can be tougher than he thinks. That someone can know the truth and still stay."" 

Alex felt something shift in his chest—a mix of validation, responsibility, and the surreal realization that he mattered to an immortal who'd shaped history. 

""So I'm not just a pet project,"" Alex said. 

""You're a friend,"" Perseus corrected. ""Dad doesn't keep friends lightly. You're in, Alex. Welcome to the weird."" 

Alex closed his laptop, the spreadsheet saved with a new final entry: 

**Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""**   
Final note: *I was right. John is immortal, was Alexander the Great, married to Merlin, father of Perseus. I'm roommate #10, longest-lasting non-institutionalized. Part of the inner circle. Not crazy. Just living with a cosmic legend who makes really good tacos.* 

# The Return of John 

The door clicked open, and John strolled in, carrying a bag from a Vietnamese place down the street, looking annoyingly refreshed for someone who'd just fled an interrogation. 

""Pho?"" he offered, grinning at Alex and Perseus. ""Figured you two would be hungry after the big reveal."" 

Alex stared at him—John Harrow, his roommate, Alexander the Great, immortal trickster, cosmic legend—and felt a laugh bubble up, manic and exhausted. 

""You're an asshole,"" Alex said. 

John grinned, setting down the pho. ""Yeah, but I'm **your** asshole. And you figured it out. Congrats, roommate. You're officially in the club."" 

Perseus raised his beer. ""To Alex, toughest mortal roommate in 4,000 years."" 

John clinked his coffee mug against it. ""To Alex. And to tacos, which almost worked."" 

Alex laughed—actually laughed—and clinked his own beer against theirs. ""To tacos. And to never believing you again when you say something's a 'prop.'"" 

""Fair,"" John conceded, grinning. 

They ate pho, Perseus told stories about drunk gods, and Alex updated his spreadsheet one last time, adding a new tab: 

**""What Happens Next?""** 

Because now that he knew the truth, the real adventure was just beginning.

# The Basics: How 7-OH Extracts Work

Plant-only 7-hydroxymitragynine isolates are made by massive-scale chromatography on high-mitragynine leaf, followed by multiple recrystallizations. A single gram of lab-grade natural 7-OH would cost well over $3,000, and there are currently zero retail vendors selling pure.

Every commercial product claiming >5% 7-OH is a semi-synthetic, produced by oxidation of mitragynine with reagents like Oxone or SeO₂. Oxidation leaves traces of heavy metals, residual solvents, or adulterants like tramadol/fentanyl analogs, making lab testing all the more important.

Quality 7-OH is ultimately determined by final purity, absence of heavy metals/solvents/adulterants, and price. Below is a ranked list based on these metrics.

# What The Vendors Told Me

I emailed every major player to try and get their view on what makes for a good product and these were the real, unfiltered responses.

[LMTLSS](https://lmtlsstabs.myshopify.com?sca_ref=9350453.va5ffD87w0)  
“Hey brother! We blend a darker 74% active with a super-clean 94+% salt-based active – the combo gives the best user experience we’ve ever seen. Then we add MIT to every single tablet because the synergy is insane. Most companies don’t do that, but it’s what separates us. Same-day shipping every day, obsessive support, and we’re here for the long haul.”

[That One Place](https://thatotherplacegj.com/product/10mg-economy-7-oh-tablets-v1-ohmsicle/)  
“In-house GMP facility, NSF-certified equipment, we press our own tabs so you know exactly what’s inside. Every extract gets 2–3 rounds of testing including Murray Brown (extended solvent panels). We send everything to an experienced test group before release – if it’s underwhelming or solvents are high, we reject the batch or price it honestly. We’re the only ones I know using thermal-protected packaging because 7-OH hates heat. No affiliate program on purpose – we want every review to stay 100% real.”

[Stardust Kratom](https://stardustkratom.com/product/buy-best-20mg-7ohm-tablets/)  
“Triple testing on everything: in-house by manufacturer → third-party → our own third-party. We use proper HPLCDAD liquid chromatography, not the cheap VWDAD that most of the industry relies on from SD Farms. Full chromatograms are on every product page.”

[Max 7OH ](https://max7oh.com/23mg-7-oh-capsules-10count)  
“We only sell 7-OH extracts. The high values come from natural mitragynine conversion. I’m a tiny operation right now, no affiliate setup yet, but open to coupon codes so we can both track sales.”

[7HydroxyRaw ](https://rawmit.com/products/lil-nans-banana-cream-pie?variant=50102742286633)  
“Every single product is third-party tested for potency, consistency, and safety. Labs are on the product pages. No affiliate spots open right now, but I’ll keep you in mind.”

[LMTLSS](https://lmtlsstabs.myshopify.com?sca_ref=9350453.va5ffD87w0) and [That One Place](https://thatotherplacegj.com/product/10mg-economy-7-oh-tablets-v1-ohmsicle/) blew everyone else away with how open and detailed they were. [Stardust ](https://stardustkratom.com/product/buy-best-20mg-7ohm-tablets/)is close behind on the testing side. The rest were polite, but these five actually gave answers that built trust.

Should I take a mii coffee apex V2 from amazon for 500€ or a lelit victoria refurbished on a reputable website (maxicoffee) for 540€ - here in France

I can't decide if i should take the ""safe"" way and go with a very reputable brand, or try the new brand that promises a lot of things. I'm also confused about the naming scheme of the Mii Coffee brand, because it looks kind of generic and seems a bit phishy ( Turin Legato = Mii Coffee =  AVX Hero = Latina ALTRO V2A = Dual Boiler Espresso Coffee Machine-CRM3007G (from aliababa)) 

Also i have a kingrinder K6 and i believe it can grind espresso grade coffee.

I'm open to new suggestions, but i want a PID and apparently OPV is great but the victoria has it too, but it's harder to reach than the one on the Mii Coffee...  
I also want 58mm for upgradability and that's why i didn't take the lelit anna with PID for around 400€ here.",1,1764184486.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Here's where I'm at for context:

  I have a fully fleshed out game. Playtested to hell by handfull of friends/family, and a guy and his gf who I met on discord, who cannot put it down.
  Cards turned out perfect. Ready to order/print my first small run of 50 sets (2 player starter kit).
  I have a store owner who is willing to hold an event for me to showcase my game, and is also interested in carrying it. We played a game of Smackers.
  I've got an awesome idea for packaging that is on theme with the sandwich/coffee/cafe' themes. - all came in the mail ready to go.
  I designed this sticker label - it's ready to be ordered.
 Finished my god forsaken rulebook, and my local print shop is going to design and print it.
 Already working on next group of new characters for expansions. 

It's a two player kit with everything you need. 3 game modes, and I'm working on one more and a 4 player teams mode. I'm hoping to sell at 25 bucks a set. I'm not sure what the store owner will sell them at yet. 
 
So.. my goal really is just to grow a community locally to start out with. Its a dream of mine to hold tournaments/events with Smackers I think that would be so fricking awesome! 
Any tips on promoting? Holding events/tournaments? Hype? How do i prepare myself or even dip my toes into selling online? 
Publishing seems really scary.. these are my babies. My beautifly ugly babies lol.

How do I turn this into a full time gig? Is that even possible?

1p7gllx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p7gllx/moving_on_advice_in_dating/,Moving on advice in dating,"Ive just started to date a couple of months now and i hit it off with some and others not. But my last date was really unexpected i surprisingly enjoyed it even though it wasn’t very traditional per say, It was a Monday night 9pm no restaurant or coffee shop so we just ended up buying snacks and kicking it in my car for 4 hours talking which i thought dam that was a pretty good time. Now its been 3 days we’ve texted back and forth with the suggested 2nd date thats been brought up and accepted just waiting obviously on our schedules to align. But tbh im not that invested she is cool and all that but someone else i met online is asking me out on a first time date. So i want to know if i should use this and ask the girl i went out with before aka car girl if she’s serious about a second date and be like a you see this going anywhere and use her answer as my choice to follow through with her or move on to the other date. Would that make me a A55h0LE if i planned it to just go on both? Or respectful to both parties. Id appreciate different perspectives ",1,1764184370.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

“Keep your gaze low,” I murmured to myself, repeating the familiar mantra that had become my ritual each time I approached the study door. My fingers adjusted the fabric of my uniform—a well-worn gray frock that seemed to cling to me like a second skin—and I smoothed down the crisp white apron that marked my status. The silver tray I held trembled slightly in my grip, a reflection of the anxiety bubbling within me. With a steadying breath, I rapped softly on the door and announced, “Coffees are here.”

“Come in,” came the voice from within, authoritative yet somehow distant.

Taking another deep breath, I pushed the door open, the hinges creaking softly as I stepped inside. Each step I took resonated with the soft clink of porcelain cups against the metal tray, a sound that felt both reassuring and ominous. As I dared to lift my eyes, I found Julius, the Elder of the Cubic Pack, ensconced in his usual chair by the window, bathed in the soft glow of the afternoon sun. Across from him sat Rose, the Luna of the pack and the Alpha’s mother, her posture exuding an air of unyielding authority as she sat gracefully in the plush velvet armchair, her back impossibly straight.

These were the formidable figures I, a mere omega wolf and maid, had to impress.

“At long last, I’ve been waiting for this,” Rose declared, her voice smooth yet edged with impatience, gesturing for me to approach.

I inched closer, careful not to meet their gazes, balancing the tray on one hand with a practiced ease. I placed a cup before each of them, my heart racing as I said, “Your coffee, Elder Julius. Luna Rose.”

Years of service to the Alpha family had sharpened my skills to a fine point; I moved with a grace that belied the turmoil within me, ensuring not a single drop was spilled. As I straightened up, I dared to glance at Rose, hoping for a nod of acknowledgment, a flicker of approval—anything to signal that I wasn’t invisible in their eyes.

Her red-painted nails glimmered as she lifted her cup, and for a fleeting moment, I held my breath, anticipating a sign of satisfaction. Instead, after a sip, Rose’s expression crumbled into one of disgust.

“What is this?” she barked, slamming the cup down onto the table with a force that made me flinch.

I was no fool; I knew better than to respond with the obvious answer—”coffee.” I kept my lips sealed, bracing myself for yet another wave of her relentless complaints.

“This isn’t coffee. This is… garbage!” she spat, and in a fit of anger, she flung the contents of her cup onto the fine carpet, the dark liquid spreading like a dark stain of doom.

I stood frozen, my jaw slack, watching as the coffee seeped into the luxurious fibers, feeling as though I were witnessing a terrible omen unfold before my eyes.

“What’s wrong, darling? The coffee’s just dandy,” Elder Julius drawled, his tone laced with sarcasm.

“Dandy? You’ve got a real knack for bad taste, sweetheart.” Rose shot me a glare that could have cut glass, her voice dripping with disdain. “You should be grateful I’m not in the mood to toss a peasant out. Get your ugly mug out of my sight before I make you regret it.”

My hands itched to form fists, but I resisted the urge, keeping them at my sides as I bit down on my cheeks until I tasted blood. “Yes, Luna.”

It was always the same tiresome routine. No matter how much I swallowed my pride or bit my tongue, it never seemed to suffice. In the eyes of Luna and Elder, I was nothing more than a lowly servant, a shadow in their grand lives. I turned sharply on my heel and made my way toward the door, my heart heavy with the weight of their disdain.

“So, have you wrapped up the wedding plans for Regis?” Elder Julius’s voice cut through the air, and my ears perked up involuntarily at the mention of his name.

“Absolutely. The Beta’s daughter is a fine choice. She’ll make a splendid Luna,” Rose replied, her voice dripping with satisfaction.

I froze in place, my hand slipping from the doorknob like a wilted flower losing its grip on life.

“Have you told Regis?” Julius inquired, his tone casual, as if discussing the weather.

“He’s over the moon. They’re destined for each other as mates, after all.”

Destined. Mates. Wedding. Those words clashed violently in my mind, like a snake and a rabbit caught in a deadly standoff. It felt so wrong. Just days ago, Regis had whispered sweet promises to me: ‘You will be my Luna, Yuri. The one I’ll cherish forever.’

He always vowed that I was the woman he would fight for, no matter the odds. And now… now he was preparing to marry another woman. He hadn’t uttered a single word about this!

My heart raced painfully, threatening to burst as the chatter swirled around me like a tempest. ‘You’re being foolish,’ I chastised myself. ‘Have faith in Regis! Perhaps this is merely what his parents desire. There must be a reason, and he will explain it to you!’

He better.

I clutched that tray like it was a lifeline, forcing myself to move forward, but my steps felt unsteady, as if I were treading on quicksand. Once I cleared the study, I nearly stumbled down the hallway, my vision blurring with each stride, as if unseen hands were squeezing the breath from my lungs.

“He wouldn’t. He couldn’t,” I repeated under my breath, hoping to anchor myself in reality.

By the time I reached the stairwell, I was nearly sprinting. My breaths came in short, ragged gasps, and my heart pounded against my temples like a war drum.

“Regis,” I whispered, urgency lacing my voice. “I need to find Regis.”

Without a thought for decorum, I bypassed the customary knock at his door. My hand gripped the handle, and I swung it open, bursting into the room unannounced.

“Yuri?” he exclaimed, surprise lighting up his features as he noticed me. He stood by the window, his broad shoulders framed by the warm afternoon light, his golden hair glowing like a halo. His blue eyes, deep and inviting, resembled the ocean, a place I longed to dive into. He was the handsome man who made my heart race, the one who kept me awake at night with his messages.

He was the one I loved more than anyone else.

“What are you doing here? Quick, shut the door! What if someone sees us?” He hurried across the room, urgency in his movements. As soon as he clicked the door shut, Regis enveloped me in his arms, his warmth enveloping me like a comforting blanket. “You showed up just when I needed you. I’ve missed you, Yuri.”

With those sweet words, he kissed me, his lips moving against mine with a practiced ease, as if the earth-shattering news I had just learned had never crossed our paths.

“Stop,” I murmured against his lips, my hands pressing against his chest, desperately trying to create a barrier between us.

“Yuri, what’s—”

“Stop!” I pushed him back, stepping out of his reach, my breath uneven and my hands trembling with emotion. I didn’t care about maintaining composure anymore. “Tell me the truth, Regis.”

His brows furrowed, confusion etching his features. “About what?”

“I heard them,” I stammered, my voice cracking under the weight of my anguish. “Your parents. They were talking about your wedding. To Jasmine.”

The change in his expression was immediate. I could see the tension in his jaw tighten, the way he looked away as his hands ran through his hair—it was all the answer I needed.

I gasped, “Haa. You’ve got to be kidding me.”

“I am sorry,” Regis uttered, his gaze still averted, unable to meet my eyes. “I have to.”

I took a step back, biting my lip as the emotions I had suppressed in front of his parents began to spill over. “You promised me. You said it didn’t matter that I am an omega. That…”

“I DO LOVE YOU!” he interrupted, his voice rising with urgency as he stepped closer, his eyes locking onto mine with intensity. “I still do. But I have responsibilities, Yuri. I’m the Alpha. I have to think about what’s best for the pack. And you? You’re not the Luna I need.”

A solitary tear slipped down my cheek, a salty trail marking my heartache. I didn’t wipe it away; it felt pointless. Regis had made his choice, and it was clear: an omega wolf was deemed worthless. That was me. The garbage.

“I never wanted to hurt you,” he whispered, his voice thick with regret. “But my parents won’t accept this. Even the members of our pack won’t accept you as their Luna.”

This was it. He was discarding me.

“But there’s another way.” Regis reached for my hand, desperation etched on his face.

With tears continuing to flow, I looked at him, feeling lost, empty, and confused. What was he saying? What on earth did it mean that he found a way to resolve this?

“You don’t have to leave my side,” he said, his voice softening. “I’ll marry Jasmine, but… we can still be together. You’ll always have a place in my life. You’ll be my mistress.”",1,1764184262.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Difference here is not something I only witness around me; it seeps into me ، I feel it in the language I stumble through, in the letters that refuse to shape themselves as I want, in the glances I learn to read without words ، I once thought transformation arrived all at once, like a revelation or a rebirth, but now I realize it happens like a rose opening: slowly, with a beautiful ache, and with a patience that resembles longing.

There is a hidden beauty in being a stranger — in stepping out of your old self to discover what remains of you after distance . At first, I resisted the difference; I feared losing my original features, feared my accent would dissolve, feared silence would return me to myself as a stranger. But the Italian balcony mornings taught me that difference does not swallow us; it purifies us from the heaviness of sameness. And that a person is not born once, but as many times as they choose to transform.

Self-transformation is not a journey to another place, but to another depth of meaning. It is when you look out from your balcony and realize what has changed is not the scene, but your gaze. It is drinking the same tea, but with a new flavor gifted to you by your altered awareness. It is becoming more able to listen to what is not said — to that language the world speaks when we are quiet.

And in every morning like this, when the warmth of the tea blends with Italy’s autumn breeze, I smile softly: because I no longer search for my old self, but celebrate my transformed one — the self that breathes multiplicity and welcomes difference as a daily prayer, as a subtle art of existence.",1,1764184215.0,u_1_reemm,0,1.0,False

This is going to be lengthy, but I truly hope I get some responses. 

About 2 months ago I started suffering with constipation and hemorrhoids. The hemorrhoids have gotten worse since then and they prolapse when I try to use the bathroom and also make it hard for stool to pass. I was advised to eat more fiber.

I have since then got Metamucil and try to take that every other day. I also am eating less because I am developing a little fear of eating.
The last 2 weeks, I either have constipation or diarrhea. And my stomach cramps, I also can’t tolerate regular milk in my coffee anymore. I have to use oat milk. This was sudden.

I saw my doctor today and she said she thinks it’s the beginning of IBS and sent a referral to GI. Last night after my diarrhea episode I develop upper abdomen pain. Like a full ache and burn. It’s not excruciating just very uncomfortable. 

Also, my stress has been through the roof. I am very depressed and sad and do stressed out due to other stuff going on.

Chapter 01: A Black Hair Boy


The day Lucian Lysander obtained his first story was the day he understood the world for what it truly was.

And that was the day he died.

A long dagger, dipped in the blood of eight humans, slipped from his hand and clattered to the floor. His right arm hung twisted unnaturally. Bone cracked, tissue torn. Where his heart once rested, there was now a gaping hole, blood spreading out in bubbling pools. In his bloody left hand, Lucian held his heart. Still beating. Still alive outside his body.

The grand auditorium had once carried the scent of old dust and dry air. Now it reeked of a thick metallic scent of blood. Instead of a cheering crowd, its empty hall was drenched in red stains and shredded flesh. Yet the music still played.

At the center of the stage, Lucian knelt, blood flowing freely from his head. The crimson droplets fell upon his hair, white as unmarked parchment. They slid down those soft, silken strands but never reached the pale face beneath, a face that seemed to bear the quiet ache of all the world.

Unaware of those his eyes, eyes like the clear sky of the Lysanders, gleamed even in the dim light. Eyes that held the warmth of a summer dawn, and a darkness deeper than the most violent storms.

And those eyes were watching something.

Not the seven corpses behind him, those he had dispatched with desperate precision in that ruthless survival game.

Not even the dying body of the Unread lying before him, a creature that had once embodied terror itself, now shrunken and frail, like a withered lotus abandoned by both grace and beauty. It had crumbled to dust, yet remained in place, untouched only because there was no breeze in the sealed hall to carry it away.

Lucian spared it only a passing glance. It was nothing more than an empty shell now, its essence residing within the Codex.

He released his heart. It no longer beats.

From his left palm, something stirred.

Now hovering above his hand was his Codex, its black leather cover weathered and cracked, as though discarded and forgotten long ago.

The once-empty, yellowed pages of the ancient grimoire no longer lay blank. Across the first sheet, dark ink bled into intricate letters. He could read them clearly now:

Chapter One: A Song of Love and Sorrow

As he stared at the words, Lucian understood what he had become.

“How pathetic,” he murmured. “We were meant to be masters of these puppets, yet we are no different. Vessels without souls. Humans without faces. Names without identities. Characters without a story. Soulless, destinyless.”

His voice trembled, half with awe, half with despair.

“Even so,” he whispered, “no matter how cruel our existence is, we must never forget—
the moment we accept these stories, we will gain a soul… that is not our own.”

                   
                                *****

Three days ago

Ring-ring! Ring-ring!

The alarm clock rattled on the bedside table, its mechanical ringing cutting through the silence of the room. But the reason for its existence seemed pointless, because the black-haired boy had barely blinked throughout the night.

“What do you think? Am I really going crazy?” he muttered, rubbing his tired eyes. “Damn it, every time I sleep, I dream of a burning house… no, more like a palace. People dying, a ghost, seven shadows… and so much pain.”

He let the alarm blare for another minute until its shrill tone became more irritating than his own thoughts. Finally, he slammed it off, waking up another occupant of the room, a golden-furred dog sprawled tightly beside him.

“So, tell me, Prologue,” he said with a crooked grin. “Am I really crazy?”

“Woof!”

“Wait… did you just say yes?”

The boy looked down at the dog, now lazily rolling against his arm.

“You stupid mutt. Have you forgotten who kept you fat and fluffy all this time?”

The boy, somewhere between fifteen and sixteen, lay on the bed without a shirt. A thin stain of crimson blood trailed from his stomach, now dried, but its path still visible, seeping slowly into the bedsheet. Judging by the wound, it looked like the work of a knife.

His dog, a lazy companion with sleepy eyes, stared at the wound for a while before leaning in to lick it, as if to comfort his roommate. But before the animal could touch him, the boy raised a hand to stop him.

“What are you doing? I don’t need an infection on top of the pain. And you’re a dog, idiot, not a cat.”

The dog continued to stare, unmoved.

“What? I need to keep training, don’t I? Now get up.”

Letting Prologue off the bed, he straightened the messy sheets before heading to the bathroom for a shower. Of course, after some struggle with a needle and bandages.

A few minutes later, he emerged, wearing black trousers and buttoning up a crisp white shirt. He lit the stove and set a small pot of water to boil. Then added tea leaves, a spoon of sugar, and that was his breakfast for today, a cup of tea.

He grabbed a bag of dog food and filled two bowls, then picked another and filled it with water.

“Damn it, Prologue,” he sighed. “You’re the reason I’ve got zero savings after two years.”

Setting the bowls down, and finishing his tea, he crouched to give the lazy dog a quick pat before leaving.

“Don’t eat it all at once,” he warned, putting down the teacup and grabbing his bag. “You’ll be hungry the rest of the day.”

“Woof!”

He chuckled, closed the door behind him, locked it, and checked twice before finally heading out.

He walked with a sluggish gait, his steps uneven and weary. Sleep had been a stranger for days. Whatever energy or excitement he once had had long abandoned him. But those damn dreams, they never left.

Now, they had begun to bleed into his waking hours.

‘Damn it… what are those? My—my… No, it can’t be true.’

A thought tried to take shape in his mind, only for him to crush it before it could form.

‘Lucian… I am Lucian. But Lucian who?’

All he remembered of his life were the past three years and his name. Lucian. It meant light.

“Heh,” he muttered under his breath, lips curling in bitter amusement. “Quite a name for someone living in darkness.”

Everything before that was gone, buried behind a thick fog of mystery he couldn’t pierce no matter how hard he tried.

Lost in his usual thoughts, Lucian didn’t notice how his feet had already carried him through the narrow streets. The small town slowly stirred awake around him, greeting the same morning he had seen every day for the past three years.

The same hole-ridden Nether pipes breathed thin curls of blue smoke from their cracks, yet never once hummed. The same red-brick buildings leaned toward the dark, sunlit sky. The same streetlights flickering. The same group of workers marching toward their daily toil. The same restaurant by the corner pulled down its shutters. The same drunken office workers drifted home, supporting each other without caring who had the farthest to go. 

The same newspaper boy darted over the cobblestones, his cry for the morning news echoing through the narrow lanes.

And as always, the clown was there.

He stood at the corner like part of the scenery, dressed in red-and-white striped pants and a matching top dotted with pale circles. His painted smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.

When Lucian passed, the clown lifted a hand in greeting. Two balloons floated from his grasp. One black, another white.

Before long, he reached the market district, just a ten-minute walk from his tiny apartment.

He stood outside a café named “Morning Hue.”

The café occupied a small section of the ground floor of a four-story building, its upper levels filled with apartments and small artisan workshops. Its entrance nestled beneath a large, ornate clock that jutted from the wall.

Brass and bronze gears caught the morning sun, scattering warm light across the cobblestones. The sunlight turned the clock’s rings into a soft halo of copper and gold, casting long shadows on the stone wall. Sometimes, birds perched on its arms, adding a small touch of life to the still mechanical structure.

The café’s door was simple wood, framed by tall windows that allowed warm morning light to spill inside.

Lucian pushed the door open. The bell chimed, and the rich aroma of coffee greeted him.

Inside, the café exuded a cozy charm with its bronze Nether pipes, nickel-gray walls, maroon chairs, polished brass fixtures, and shelves stacked with books on alchemy, biology, and the nature of the Unread, none of which explored the realms of imagination. It was also the most avoided corner of the entire café, despite the warm atmosphere everywhere else.

An old man sipped his coffee in an empty corner beneath the soft music playing from a gramophone. His deep blue hair contrasted with his wrinkled face and tired eyes.

“Am I late, boss?” Lucian asked.

“No, not at all,” the old man replied, glancing at his wristwatch with a smile.

Lucian adjusted his apron, striped in classic patterns, and headed toward the back room to begin his work.

The day passed as it always had for the past three years. Morning Hue rarely saw many customers these days, with the dwindling population of a town that had never been large to begin with. Most of the residents he saw in the morning were almost everyone who lived here. Or at least that was all he ever saw. Not that he knew, he never talked to anyone. Just him and the café. But Lucian’s salary remained steady. In that sense, life continued just as it always had.

“Hey, are you alright, Lucian?” a young woman asked, her gentle voice startling him out of his thoughts.

“Yes… why do you ask, Lily?”

Aside from Lucian, seven people worked at the café. All of them shared the same striking blue hair, bound together by family ties. Lily, the owner’s granddaughter, was the second youngest. She had a brother, her parents, and two distant relatives.

“You’ve got dark circles under your eyes,” she observed.

Despite the five-year age difference, she treated him more like a friend than a subordinate.

“Wait a second,” she said, disappearing briefly before returning with a small, round box.

“Here. Apply this every night before bed. And get eight hours of sleep, alright?”

“What is this?” Lucian began to refuse, but the look in her eyes silenced him, and he accepted it.

“Hey, could you bring a slice of cake for the old man?” Lily’s brother called from the counter.

He was two years younger than Lily. Although Lucian wouldn’t admit it, the guy was handsome and far better with customers. But for some reason Lucian always forgot his name.

Without a word, Lucian sliced a piece of cake, without even asking which one he placed it on a plate, and took it to their sole customer.

He set the plate down on the table in the corner near the gramophone, which played its usual soft melodies. An old man sat opposite the owner, a chessboard between them.

Lucian glanced at the old man’s sweaty, intense expression and knew he was losing again. The owner, calm and unshaken, looked as if victory were inevitable.

The old man was the only regular Morning Hue had seen in a long time. His wife had passed away a year ago, and his son had left the town for better opportunities. Now alone, he spent most of his days here, enjoying chess and company.

“Ah… damn it.” The old man looked at Lucian with pleading eyes. “Lucian, help me out.”

“May I…?” He looked at his boss. After all, helping him meant neglecting his work in front of his employer.

“Sure. It’s too easy without you,” the owner said with a smile.

The match didn’t last two minutes. The owner won again.

“Lucian, join me from the start next time,” the old man muttered.

“No. Unlike you, he has work to do,” the owner replied.

Frustrated by the loss, the old man switched on the radio for distraction.

The radio on the open windowsill, bathed in warm sunlight, played the same channel the entire town relied on.

“As we know, Sapphire Town was once a mining town. Many people died in those mines. Burned or buried underground,” a male anchor said.

Sapphire Town lay five kilometers east of here, much larger than this place.

“Yes, and that is why most of the Unread there have fire abilities,” a female anchor replied.

An Unread was a human turned monster most of them, anyway.

They were living manifestations of unresolved human stories, born from violent, unjust, or unnatural deaths. Each one reflected someone’s life, regrets, or trauma. Their unfinished stories became monsters, their lives transformed into power.

“And this one seems to be the same,” the male anchor continued.

“But how did it escape from the Librarians?”

“We don’t have all the details, but it’s said to burn people with a touch.”

“How terrifying.”

The old man set down his plate and turned off the radio.

“How terrifying. What are those Librarians even doing?” he grumbled.

“Hmm… be careful on your way home, Lucian,” the owner said with concern.

Lucian returned to the back of the café, where Lily and her brother were sharing half a strawberry cake.

“Here’s yours.” She handed him a slice. “Did he ask for help again?”

Lucian took the cake and sat on the iron stool. “Yes. But we still lost.”

“Grandpa’s impossible to beat. I’ve never won. Have you?” she asked her brother.

“No. I don’t like chess. People call it a strategy game, but that’s just the fool’s watered-down version of what a true strategy game created to teach.”

Lucian almost frowned. Winning was already hard enough for his mind as it was. What kind of game could be harder than that?

‘He looks tired lately,’ Lucian thought as he took a bite.

“Oh, almost forgot. What’s your plan for tomorrow?” Lily asked.

“For what?”

“Tomorrow is your birthday. Did you forget?”

“Oh…”

“So? What’s the plan?”

“…”

Without replying he finished the cake, licking the last bit from the fork. He glanced past the window. Despite the feeling that time had passed, it wasn’t even noon yet. As he looked, the world shimmered for a moment. Lily’s brother nearly fell, catching himself against the wall.

“How much longer do we need to run this café?” he said, voice heavy and strained.

“Not much longer,” the owner replied suddenly from behind him.

Lucian blinked and looked at the window again.

Night had fallen. Stars twinkled. A blood-red moon hanging.

The same clown in green and white star-patterned pants and a matching lined top smiled and waved at him. Two balloons floated from its other hand. One white. Another black.

After finishing the cleaning, Lucian headed home, but the owner stopped him. His expression had turned solemn.

“Are you turning sixteen tomorrow?”

“Ah… yes,” Lucian said with hesitation.

“Which means you might Awaken.”

“…” Lucian remained silent.

“Hmm… let me tell you a story, then.”

“Ah… a story. But stories are banned. Telling one is punishable by law.”

“Only if there’s a witness.” He smiled softly.

“It’s been so long since I heard a story, much less told one. But as far as I remember, it goes like this. Long ago, a boy wanted to touch the sun. That desire led him to make a deal with a black magician, who gave him a seed. The boy planted it and cared for it every day. One day the seed grew, taller and taller, lifting the boy with it toward the sun. But the tree burned, and so did the boy.”

Lucian listened, confused by the poor display of storytelling. As a teenager of the modern era who had never heard a real story, he had always imagined stories to be magical experiences. But this…

The owner coughed. “It’s been so long. My abilities as a storyteller have declined. But what I want to say is, don’t chase the impossible. Understand?”

Lucian nodded and thanked him before leaving. He wanted to ask about the conversation with Lily’s brother, but the topic felt too sensitive.

‘I might become jobless soon.’


                               *****

Lucian walked beneath the crimson moonlight. He passed the park that had never once seen children play. He passed the hospital whose lights had been shut off for years.

Then he stopped and looked up. He sighed and whispered,

“I wish this world would end today.”

As he made his way home, a distant glow flickered.

Chapter 1
The last night Arabelle Greyle spent with Benjamin Chantler, he lost control more than ever.
Her fingers brushed against the ring on his hand—and in that instant, memories came flooding back.
Just a few days ago, she'd seen the gossip online: Benjamin was about to marry the daughter of the Shelton Group's CEO.
Noticing she was distracted, he leaned down and gave her a long, intense kiss.
With her mind all foggy from passion, he slipped a bank card into her bra.
""Just be good for me. I'm getting married next month. Let's end this.""
Arabelle nodded obediently. ""Okay.""
Seeing that she didn't cry or make a scene, Benjamin frowned instead. ""You okay?""
Arabelle gave him a light and comforting laugh. ""I'm good.""
She had long moved past the point where his actions could hurt her.
Everyone who knew them could see that Arabelle was crazy about Benjamin, almost to the point of obsession.
She'd been chasing him since she was 18.
Right after graduation, she joined the Chantler Group and became his secretary.
During the day, she helped him out at work without a hitch. At night, she was right there in bed with him.
Whenever trouble came up, she'd jump in front of him like a shield. When it came to parties and drinks, she'd step up to take shots for him.
She always carried three notebooks in her bag filled with all his likes and dislikes. The moment he gave her a look, she knew exactly what he needed.
For seven years, she followed him—without a title, without a promise. Only recently had people begun to change their tone.
Instead of calling her foolish, they'd smile and ask when the wedding news would come.
No one could believe she'd just sit back and watch him marry someone else. Not even Benjamin.
What they didn't know, though, was that a week earlier, Arabelle had already said yes to her parents' request to head back to her hometown for a blind date.
***
She first met Benjamin when she was 18.
One day, she got a call from her mother.
""Belle! Your dad was in a car crash. He's in the ER— it's bad. You need to come home right now... before it's too late.""
Arabelle's mind went completely blank.
In a panic, she rushed out and accidentally crashed into Benjamin's car.
Luckily, he hit the brakes just in time. She wasn't hurt too badly. After getting up, she limped toward the hospital as fast as she could.
Benjamin stopped her. After asking what happened, he made a quick phone call and then drove her there himself.
When they got there, the hospital director quickly led in the best team for surgery—and somehow managed to bring her dad back from the brink of death.
Arabelle and her mother held each other tight, their faces wet with tears of joy.
Through her blurry eyes, she spotted Benjamin standing a little way off, quietly thanking the hospital director.
That was when she realized he was the one who'd asked the director to come.
At that moment, the young man in the light, calm and serious, felt like a god who'd appeared in her life.
At first, all Arabelle wanted to do was thank him.
That was why she'd been by his side, trying to find small ways to show her appreciation for what he'd done.
After graduation, she joined the Chantler Group and somehow ended up sleeping with him one night. Then she became his personal secretary.
Over time, her feelings changed.
During those rare moments when he showed her kindness, she found herself having desires that felt a bit too greedy for comfort.
It was only a month ago that Benjamin suddenly started acting really cold toward her.
Feeling uneasy, she hesitated for quite a while.
After one close moment together, she finally gathered the courage to ask carefully, ""Mr. Chantler, did I do something wrong?""
Benjamin's icy, serious eyes narrowed at her.
After what felt like forever in silence, he replied, ""I'm just kind of tired of this.""
Arabelle's face went pale. Under his indifferent stare, she hurried away in embarrassment.
That same day, Benjamin left for a business trip overseas. For the first time, he didn't take her—his personal secretary—along with him.
The next day, she stumbled upon the news that he was engaged to Adelina Shelton.
When he returned a week later, there was an extra wedding ring on his finger.
That was when it hit her.
All good things have to come to an end, and it was time for her to say goodbye to Benjamin.
Benjamin had already moved out, leaving her the apartment where she'd lived for seven years.
Arabelle quickly reached out to a real estate agent to put it up for sale.
The apartment was in a great location, and she priced it way lower than what others were asking. The agent marketed it as a top listing, and that very night, someone came by to check it out and put down a deposit.
After signing the contract, the agent beamed at her. ""Ms. Greyle, the buyer is paying in full! We should wrap everything up in about a week.""
Arabelle paused for a second, then smiled and nodded.
""Alright, thanks!""
After the agent left, she started packing up the apartment.
The little lucky cat figurine on the shoe cabinet had been there since her first day moving in.
Benjamin used to joke about that cat figurine. But as soon as she turned around, he pushed her against the shoe cabinet and kissed her like he couldn't get enough.
He playfully nibbled on her earlobe while his deep voice rumbled with laughter.
""You believe this little thing can bring you luck? I can do a better job than it.""
The living room carpet was something he'd spotted at a mall during one of their overseas trips together.
He just whipped out his card and bought it right then and there. It took over half a month to arrive from across the ocean.
Once she unpacked it, he started unbuttoning her clothes with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
""When I first saw this carpet, I thought it looked very comfy to lie on.""
On the single-seat couch in the corner, he had a rare moment of softness. Once, he held her in his arms when she was sick and comforted her gently.
The razor in the bathroom was the first gift she ever gave him, and he used it for years.
On the title page of ""Business Warfare Strategies,"" the book on the far left of the shelf, there was a quick sketch of her that he drew on a whim. It was not perfect but really captures her essence.
Seven years felt like such a long time.
Long enough that even someone as proud and distant as Benjamin made unforgettable memories with her all over this place.
Arabelle went through her things, keeping some and discarding others.
But eventually, she just collapsed into the mess of scattered items, crying uncontrollably.
Chapter 2
She cried all night.
The next morning, she put some ice on her eyes for half an hour and then slathered on a thick layer of foundation. It was only then did her eyelids finally stop looking so puffy and red.
She pulled out the resignation letter she had written ages ago and headed straight to the office.
As soon as she sat down at her desk, she noticed all her coworkers in the department giving her those subtle, sympathetic looks.
Before Arabelle could ask what was up, Benjamin's office door swung open.
Adelina stepped out.
She was rocking a fancy custom dress with flawless makeup. She carried herself with that effortless elegance of someone from a wealthy family, moving around the office like she owned the place.
Arabelle finally figured out why her coworkers were giving her those sideways looks.
Everyone thought she was going to be the future wife of their boss.
But just like that, Benjamin got engaged, and her situation became awkward.
When Adelina spotted her, though, she didn't seem upset at all.
With a sweet smile on her face, she handed over an invitation to Arabelle and warmly invited her.
""Good morning, Ms. Greyle! Benjamin and I are having our engagement party in a week. I came here just to hand out invitations.
""You've worked with Benjamin the longest. We'd love for you to join us!""
Arabelle quickly put on a polite smile and took the invitation from Adelina with both hands.
""Congratulations to you, Ms. Shelton, and Mr. Chantler.""
Adelina kept her smile as she leaned in a bit closer, lowering her voice to a whisper just for the two of them.
""I heard you thought you could marry into the Chantler family? How ridiculous.
""Benjamin was just using you to practice. Otherwise, how would he keep me happy after we're married?
""Open your eyes and see how big the gap is between us. Just give up on this silly dream already.""
She maintained that smile throughout, acting all friendly. Anyone who didn't catch their chat would have thought they were just sharing some light gossip.
Arabelle stayed calm on the outside, but her fingers tightened around the invitation until her knuckles turned white.
She understood why Adelina was acting like this—who would want their husband's ex hanging around? Still, there was an uncomfortable knot tightening in her chest.
Arabelle pressed her lips together and decided to lower herself even more.
""Don't worry, Ms. Shelton. I know my place.""
There was a cold edge behind Adelina's smile.
""I hope so. But honestly, I've never been one to bet on whether people know how to behave.""
In the next moment, she grabbed Arabelle's hand and suddenly stumbled backward. Before Arabelle could react, Adelina fell straight to the floor.
After letting out a sharp cry of pain, she looked up at Arabelle with wide eyes.
""Ms. Greyle, I invited you to our engagement party. Why did you just push me down?""
The office door swung open, and Benjamin stepped out with long strides.
When he saw Adelina lying on the ground, he rushed over to help her up.
""Adelina, what happened?""
Adelina looked up at him, her eyes red and puffy. ""I was just giving Ms. Greyle the invitation for our engagement party and asking if she could come. But out of nowhere, she got upset, pushed me away, and told me to leave.""
Benjamin shot a glance at Arabelle, his eyes cold.
Arabelle frowned and quickly tried to explain, ""I didn't...""
But Benjamin cut her off sharply.
Turning back to Adelina, he asked, ""What kind of status does she even have? Is it really worth you coming all this way just to invite her?""
The room went silent. His harsh words hit Arabelle like a punch in the gut for a moment.
Adelina paused for a second but then quickly put on a smile and playfully whined at Benjamin.
""But she's your chief secretary! I just thought I'd help you keep talented people around.""
Benjamin scooped her up into his arms and headed toward the office.
As he walked, he said with a bit of authority, ""You're the future wife of this company's boss. No one's more important than you.
""Where did you twist your ankle? Let me take a look.""
Arabelle stood there, frozen with a blank look on her face, watching them walk away.
Adelina was really rushing. She couldn't even wait for Arabelle to hand in her resignation letter. But honestly, with such clumsy acting, how could Benjamin not see through it?
Still, he chose to have her back.
They were all adults here. Fairness couldn't be obtained just by throwing fits or crying about it.
A heavy feeling settled in Arabelle's chest as she calmly pulled out her resignation letter.
Just when she was about to go in and ask Benjamin to sign it, he suddenly walked out.
He stood tall and straight, his clothes fluttering a bit as he moved. His long fingers tapped lightly on her desk, and he said bluntly, ""Adelina doesn't want to see you. So just resign.
Benjamin's cold, hard gaze showed no emotion at all.
Arabelle's heart raced for a moment, and she tightened her grip on the resignation letter she'd prepared that morning.
After seven years of working hard at the Chantler Group, she never thought she'd be leaving like this in such a humiliating way.
A bitter smile crept onto her face as she nodded slowly.
""Alright.""
Her calm acceptance with no tears and no shouting, sparked a surprising bit of annoyance in Benjamin's chest.
He frowned. ""Just leave today. I'll have the finance team give you double what you're owed.""
Arabelle smiled faintly. ""Got it. Thanks, Mr. Chantler.""
Benjamin turned and walked away without looking back.
Chapter 3
Arabelle sat back down at her desk, ripped up the resignation letter she no longer needed, and submitted her resignation through the company system.
Maybe Benjamin had already given HR a heads-up. Her resignation got approved almost right away, and it was quickly sent over to Benjamin for his final confirmation.
Not long after that, a notification popped up on Arabelle's screen. ""Your resignation application has been approved.""
At the same time, a large sum of severance pay landed in her bank account.
She hurriedly packed up her stuff. As she walked out with her things in hand, she passed by Benjamin's office.
The door wasn't fully shut. There was just a little crack.
Through that gap, she spotted Benjamin inside, head down as he looked over some papers. Adelina was sitting next to him, enjoying a dessert.
She took a bite herself and then scooped another spoonful of dessert and offered it to Benjamin. ""You've gotta try this. It's so good!""
Benjamin took a bite of the cake with the spoon that Adelina had used without hesitation. ""It's pretty good.""
Arabelle glanced at his face and gave a wry smile.
On her first day at work, she found out that Benjamin had two hard-and-fast rules.
First off, he was a germaphobe and never shared utensils with anyone.
At first, he wouldn't even kiss her in bed.
Their first kiss only happened because she was running a high fever. Her mind was all foggy from it, and when she talked to him, their lips accidentally brushed against each other. She went pale with shock, but he just leaned down casually and kissed her.
Back then, Arabelle thought she was special to him.
Secondly, he really didn't like sweet stuff.
After being with him for seven years, she had never seen him touch anything sugary. Even when she treated herself to some cakes now and then, he wouldn't even look at them.
She had memorized all his likes and dislikes. She filled up three thick notebooks with notes because she was scared that even the tiniest mistake would annoy him.
But it turned out her ""secret rulebook"" was just a big joke.
When he met the right person, he was willing to tolerate everything.
So, pulling out that heavy notebook, Arabelle let out a laugh at herself before tossing it in the trash without thinking twice and walked away.
Benjamin looked up from his papers. Through the crack in the door, he caught a quick glimpse of someone familiar rushing by, and for a moment, it threw him off.
When Arabelle got home, she told a few friends that she had decided to quit her job and head back to her hometown. They made plans to grab dinner the next day.
She thought she'd never see Benjamin again in her life. But surprisingly, as she followed the waiter toward their private room, she spotted someone familiar on the second floor out of the corner of her eye.
It was Benjamin and his friend leaning against the railing, smoking away.
With his back turned to her and a faint red glow from the cigarette between his fingers, there was an unexpected touch of loneliness about him.
Arabelle only stole a glance at him before looking down quickly, pretending not to notice him.
But then she heard Benjamin talking to someone else carried over by the wind.
She could make out his friend's voice asking, ""Are you really thinking about marrying Adelina? Ms. Greyle has been around for so long. We all figured you'd end up with her.""
Benjamin's tone was flat. ""I never thought about it.""
His friend chuckled and teased, ""Well, aside from her family not being the best, Ms. Greyle is gorgeous, knows how to handle things, and has been totally devoted to you. After all this time, you've never felt anything for her?""
Benjamin went quiet for a couple of seconds. Then his cold, indifferent voice floated over to her on the breeze.
""How could I ever let myself catch feelings for a plaything?""
Arabelle froze. The blood drained from her face.
When she caught the waiter's curious gaze on her, she dug her nails into her palm and slowly followed along.
She ate without tasting a thing. Her friends were all college roommates who knew about her feelings for Benjamin over the years.
When they found out she was heading back home, they felt both happy for her and sorry for what she'd gone through. The group hugged each other tightly and cried together.
After the lively crowd thinned out, Arabelle watched as her friends got picked up one by one by their husbands or boyfriends. Once again, she was left all alone.
She tightened her grip on her bag strap and was about to head out when her phone suddenly rang.
Glancing at the screen, she saw it was Benjamin calling. She reached to hang up, but accidentally hit ""answer"" instead.
Frowning and ready to end the call right away, she heard a voice on the other end that she didn't recognize.
""Hi there, is this Ms. Arabelle Greyle?""
Arabelle paused for a second. ""Yes, this is her.""
The caller replied politely, ""Ms. Greyle, Mr. Chantler has had too much to drink. Could you come pick him up? We're at...""
Benjamin was never the type to go overboard with drinking. Given his status, not many would even think about pushing him to drink more.
""So how did he end up drunk?""
Arabelle didn't really question why the waiter called her. She just replied in a distant voice, ""Sorry, but I can't come right now. Please get in touch with his fiancée to pick him up.""
As soon as she hung up, she heard the waiter on the other end gasp in shock.
""Mr. Chantler! Mr. Chantler, what's wrong? Mr. Chantler!""
The call ended abruptly.
Arabelle's expression changed instantly, and panic washed over her like a wave. Before she could fully wrap her head around what was going on, her body had already taken off toward the second floor.
She burst into the private room and shouted anxiously, ""Benjamin!""
When the door to the private room swung open, Benjamin was slouched in his chair, looking all dark and moody. His right hand was covered in blood, bright red and shiny.
Broken glass was scattered all over the table and around his feet.
The waiter stood nearby, fidgeting with worry on his face.
But Benjamin seemed completely unfazed, like he wasn't even the one hurt.
When he heard her voice, he turned to look at her, his eyes deep and shadowy.
His voice came out rough, with a hint of something almost like grievance.
""Didn't you say you weren't coming?""
Chapter 4
Arabelle let out a quiet sigh. ""Let me take care of your wound first.""
Benjamin didn't say yes or no.
He was acting a bit strange. As Arabelle got closer, she caught a strong smell of alcohol on him and figured he must have been pretty drunk.
He probably forgot that she wasn't his secretary anymore.
The waiter, looking relieved, quickly went to fetch the restaurant's first-aid kit.
Having been by Benjamin's side for years, Arabelle had made it a point to learn quite a bit about first aid for all sorts of unexpected situations, so she knew what she was doing.
She leaned in closer and when she saw his palm—a messy mix of blood and flesh—her brows knitted together instinctively.
""It might sting a little, just hang in there.""
""Okay.""
Arabelle carefully pulled out the pieces of glass stuck in his palm, put some medicine on the cut, and then, almost like she was calming a child, instinctively leaned down and blew gently on it.
The man sitting at the head of the table watched her gentle profile with focus, his throat gulped.
When she finished wrapping his hand neatly, she tied a small, careful bow to hold it all together.
She looked up at him with a smile. ""Mr. Chantler, all done with the bandaging...""
But before she could finish her sentence, Benjamin suddenly reached out with his good hand, grabbed her jaw, and leaned down to kiss her.
His kiss was hot and intense, full of emotions that were hard to explain.
Arabelle's eyes went wide, and she stared at him in shock.
In the next second, she didn't think twice before shoving at his chest with both hands.
But it was her who ended up losing her balance and falling to the floor. Her gaze stayed locked on him, filled with panic.
""Benjamin...""
He looked down at her, his voice rough. ""Arabelle, you know... you don't have to go.""
A sudden sharp pain shot through her chest.
He had pushed her away just yesterday, and now he was saying she could stay?
Just a moment ago, he even told someone else that she was just a toy for him to play with.
She could see the desire in his eyes clearly, which only made this whole situation feel totally absurd and ridiculous.
""Benjamin, we're done. You said so yourself.
""If you keep hanging onto me like this... I might start thinking you've actually fallen for me.""
Benjamin's pupils shrank suddenly, and the emotions in his eyes vanished right away, turning icy cold.
Out of nowhere, a phone rang.
Arabelle glanced over and saw Adelina's name pop up on the screen.
She raised her voice a bit. ""Mr. Chantler, your fiancée is trying to reach you.""
Benjamin looked down at the phone screen, his face going completely stone-cold.
""Get out.""
Arabelle quickly got up from the floor and rushed out of the private room.
As soon as she stepped through the door, she heard what sounded like a phone being smashed behind her. She hesitated for just a moment but didn't look back and just kept walking straight ahead.
Outside the restaurant, she quickly flagged down a taxi and hopped in.
As the car pulled away, she caught sight of the driver's unsure glance in the rearview mirror.
Arabelle blankly pulled out a mirror and took a look at herself—only then did she notice that Benjamin's kiss had smudged her lipstick, leaving marks on the corners of her mouth. She looked completely disheveled.
In a daze, she remembered that one time when Benjamin hardly ever stayed over at her place.
The next morning, they got up together to head to work. Arabelle was huddled by the vanity, rushing through her makeup to save some time. It wasn't until she was almost done that she realized Benjamin had been standing right behind her without her even noticing.
Feeling playful, he picked out a tube of lipstick for her and gestured like he wanted to put it on for her.
Worried about being late, Arabelle didn't think twice. She pouted her lips and went along with him as he traced the shape of them.
With two fingers from one hand, he lifted her chin to get her to look up at him. With his other hand, he held the lipstick and carefully applied it to her lips.
Even after he was done putting on the lipstick, he didn't let go of her jaw.
A bit of confusion flickered in her eyes as she met his gaze. She noticed that his expression was serious and intense, and he was looking right at her.
""What's up? Is it not finished yet?""
As soon as she said that, he kissed her, cutting off any further words.
When Benjamin finally pulled back, the lipstick he'd just put on had smudged all over—messy but somehow still sweet and tempting.
Arabelle let out a quick gasp and rushed to fix her swollen lips.
In the same mirror, the guy who caused it all was grinning like he found it hilarious.
As he casually wiped away the red lipstick smudge from the corner of his mouth, he chuckled in a deep voice.
""Weren't you the one who made that pouty face first, asking for a kiss?""
When she finally snapped back to reality, Arabelle looked at her reflection in the mirror—tears were already streaming down her cheeks.
Chapter 5
The next day, as soon as Arabelle woke up, she got a message from an old coworker.
""Arabelle, I found a necklace at your old desk. Do you still want it?""
Her colleague even sent a photo with the message.
Arabelle clicked on the picture and realized it was the birthday gift her mother had given her two years ago—a piece she had always loved.
She figured she must have left it behind in her rush to leave when she quit. So, she quickly made plans to meet her former coworker for lunch.
Arabelle got there early. She just arrived at the restaurant she used to go to during workdays and ordered some food when suddenly, out of nowhere, she spotted Adelina walking over from not too far away.
Gone was the sweet smile that Adelina usually wore. Instead, her face looked cold as she headed straight for Arabelle.
Arabelle couldn't help but frown. ""You...""
Before she could finish her sentence, Adelina suddenly raised her hand and slapped Arabelle hard across the face.
Along with the slap, Adelina shouted at the top of her lungs, ""You bitch! You've already been kicked out of the company. How dare you still try to steal my fiancé!""
The restaurant went completely silent in an instant, and everyone turned to stare at them in shock.
Arabelle was knocked sideways by the force of the slap. When she finally came back to reality, she realized that Adelina was just taking out her anger on her because of what had happened last night.
A sharp, stinging pain shot across her cheek. Around them, whispers quickly spread among the crowd.
""Is this a showdown with a home-wrecker? So dramatic!""
""Good for her! She's so pretty. Why would she want to be someone's mistress?""
""Aren't those Ms. Shelton from the Shelton family and Ms. Greyle, the ex-secretary? I heard Ms. Greyle was Mr. Chantler's girlfriend for years. Now that she's out of favor, the real girlfriend is coming after her. How sad!""
""Sad? What does she even have compared to Adelina? Does she really think she can compete with a Shelton heiress for a guy?""
Arabelle felt her whole body tremble as she locked eyes with Adelina, who looked ready to pounce. She bit down on her lip hard, bent down to grab her bag, and turned to walk away.
But Adelina wasn't having any of it. She looked super smug as she shot back with a cold warning.
""Arabelle, girls like you are everywhere. I could easily grab a bunch of you!
""Don't fool yourself into thinking you're special just because you've been with Benjamin for seven years! Back in the day, you'd just be another servant warming his feet!
""Let me give you a heads-up. Stay out of my way and Benjamin's. If not, I can make sure you're out of the Chantler Group in no time, and I'll also see to it that you can't stick around New York for even one more day!""
Arabelle's face went completely icy. She turned to look straight at Adelina.
""Ms. Shelton, don't worry about me. Benjamin and I haven't been tied together for ages now. I've already agreed to go back home for a blind date since my parents asked me to.
""Instead of coming here to throw threats at me, maybe focus on keeping your man in check and tell him to stop bothering me!""
She casually brought up her plan to leave, but when Adelina heard it, she totally misinterpreted it as Arabelle bragging about how Benjamin had reached out to her first.
Adelina's expression got even worse, a nasty look flashing across her face.
""Going back home for a blind date? Sounds more like you're heading back to pick up some tricks from your mom on how to snag guys!
""I heard your dad got into a car accident and now he can't use one of his legs. What a shame.
""How did your single mom manage to raise you? I bet she had to sell herself just to make ends meet.
""You grew up around that kind of stuff, which is why you think it's okay to go after someone else's fiancé. Like mother, like daughter!""
Adelina's voice was sharp and grating. Arabelle couldn't take it anymore.
""Shut up!""
She grabbed the coffee cup in front of her and splashed it right onto Adelina's face.
Coffee stains were all over Adelina, from her head to her toes. She looked at Arabelle in shock, yelled out loud, and shook with anger.
""Arabelle, how could you splash me like that? You're such a jerk. I won't let you get away with this!""
Arabelle's expression was icy and serious. ""If you keep talking trash, I won't just splash you. I'll hit you too!""
Just as she finished saying that, Benjamin walked in through the restaurant door.
He took one look at what was happening inside and headed straight for them.
Adelina immediately started crying and complained to him. ""Benjamin, I was just having a little chat with her when she threw coffee all over me.""
Arabelle's face turned bright red with rage. ""You were the one who insulted my family first—
Before she could finish her sentence, Benjamin grabbed a glass of iced water from a passing waiter.
With one quick motion, he poured the iced water right over Arabelle's head.
That cut off whatever else Arabelle wanted to say and completely snuffed out any last bit of affection she had for him in that moment.
Chapter 6
The cold water dripped down from her hair and soaked into her clothes, making her shiver.
Her hair stuck to her face, and the wet fabric of her outfit showed the outline of her underwear. She looked like a total mess.
Benjamin stared into Arabelle's eyes, which were filled with tears but she was holding back how she really felt.
""Just apologize to Adelina.""
That was always Benjamin's way.
He didn't care about what was right or wrong. He just wanted to protect whoever he chose.
After a moment of surprise, Adelina next to them quickly put on a smug look. She shot a challenging glare at Arabelle, waiting for an apology.
Arabelle spoke in a daze. ""What if... I don't?""
Benjamin's face was cold and hard. ""If you mess with my fiancée, I'll make sure you can never stay in New York again. And good luck trying to use that card of yours.""
Arabelle let out a bitter laugh.
They all thought she was with him for the money. They figured she couldn't bear to leave behind the glitz of this big city and would hang on no matter how tough it got. But they had no clue that she stuck around here just because of him.
And about that money...
Her hands shook as she dug into her bag. She pulled out the card Benjamin had given her once and set it down on the table.
""Here's your money back.
""I'm not sticking around in New York anymore.
""Anyway, I'm heading back to my hometown soon for a blind date.""
When Benjamin heard the words ""blind date,"" his eyes widened in shock.
Arabelle turned around and started to walk away. But just a couple of steps in, everything went dark for her, and she stumbled forward, nearly falling over.
In her ears, she could faintly hear Benjamin's worried voice.
""Arabelle!""
When Arabelle came to again, she found herself in a hospital room.
Benjamin was sitting by her bedside, his gaze as deep and cold as an icy lake, filled with mixed emotions as he stared at her.
As soon as he noticed she was awake, he tossed a medical report right at her.
Arabelle picked up the report, feeling totally confused, but her face went pale as soon as she saw ""6 weeks pregnant"" printed on it.
Lately, she hadn't been hungry at all, and her period was late.
She thought it was just some hormonal stuff from stress and didn't really think much of it. Never in a million years did she imagine... that it would turn out to be a pregnancy.
Next to her, Benjamin's voice was icy and sarcastic, filled with anger like he felt tricked.
""Arabelle, I thought you were at least somewhat decent. I never expected you to be bolder than anyone else, keeping something this huge from me behind my back.""
He leaned in closer to look at her, his sharp gaze putting a lot of pressure on her, and there was a smirk on his lips that dripped with sarcasm.
""Are you really going back for a blind date... or are you secretly planning to have my baby?""
Arabelle clutched the medical report in her hand, feeling completely helpless no matter what she said, ""I just found out too...""
She went quiet as soon as those words slipped out.
The cold sarcasm in Benjamin's eyes made it clear. He didn't buy it.
He stood tall and looked down at her pale face, his presence looming over her.
""Arabelle, my child can only come from my wife.
""Any kid carried by another woman is just an unwanted mistake that shouldn't even be here.
""I've set up the abortion for tomorrow.""
With that, he turned and walked out of the room without looking back.
She had never really had a choice.
Arabelle stared blankly at his disappearing figure, tears blurring her vision.
She curled up tight around herself and buried under the quilt, sobbing hard.
After Benjamin left, probably worried that she might try to escape, he had two bodyguards posted at the door.
When Arabelle followed the nurse for her pre-op checks, those bodyguards were right there with her every step of the way.
Arabelle stayed up all night.
The next day, while waiting for the abortion, she got a bunch of videos from Adelina on her phone.
Arabelle took a quick look and realized they were clips from Adelina and Benjamin's engagement ceremony.
Benjamin was in a black suit, looking tall and sharp, giving off a gentle and classy vibe.
A slight smile was on his face as he wrapped his arm around Adelina, accepting congratulations from guests one after another.
Adelina's face lit up with a big smile as she snuggled in his arms, stealing affectionate glances at him every now and then.
Just then, a young nurse knocked on the door to remind her.
""Ms. Greyle, it's almost time for your surgery.""
Arabelle put down her phone and nodded slowly.
""Okay.""
Not too far away in a fancy banquet hall, he was grinning like it was springtime while getting engaged to someone else. Meanwhile, she found herself in the cold, quiet hospital being led into the operating room.
With a heavy heart, she spread her legs and let the cold scalpel cut through the last connection they had left.
An hour later, Arabelle was rolled out of the operating room, her face as pale as a ghost.
She lightly touched her flat stomach. There was nothing there to feel, but it felt like something really painful, something that had sunk deep into her bones, was being ripped away from her.
Every breath she took sent a jolt of pain through her body.
Back in her ward, she changed into her own clothes and headed straight for the hospital exit.
The bodyguards raised their hands to stop her.
Arabelle said calmly, ""Benjamin told you to keep an eye on me because he thought I might try to run away before the surgery. Now that your job is done, you can go back and report.""
The two bodyguards exchanged glances and then called Benjamin. But it was Adelina who picked up the phone.
Her voice dripped with annoyance, ""Why are you talking about her right now? This is so irritating, just let her go.""
After leaving the hospital, Arabelle headed straight home.
She handed over the apartment to the buyer, grabbed her packed luggage from earlier that morning, and made a beeline for the airport.
Her old colleague, who had tricked her into going to that restaurant, sent an apologetic text.
""I'm really sorry. Adelina forced me into it.""
Arabelle didn't hold it against her but chose not to reply. She just tapped to block and delete the contact.
She did the same for Adelina, who kept sending videos of the engagement ceremony just to get under her skin.
Finally, she blocked Benjamin too. Ever since she added him as a contact, she just couldn't bring herself to delete any of his messages, no matter how many times she switched phones.
As soon as the plane took off, Arabelle let a faint smile creep onto her face.
""Benjamin, you saved my dad's life, and now I've given one back to you. From here on out, I don't owe you anything.
""Goodbye... and hopefully, never again.""

My issue is that he usually doesn't initiate conversation over text when we have days off work so I start missing him.

1p7g4t7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7g4t7,"Journiv v0.1.0-beta.8: This Thanksgiving, give your family the gift of memories that last forever","Hello everyone!

First of all, thanks a lot for the amazing responses and interest in Journiv ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1onj6ay/journiv_011beta_is_out_a_selfhosted_privacyfirst/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1orsrbm/journiv_010beta4_with_oidc_is_out_and_a_sneak/)). We have [hundreds of stars](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/stargazers), thousands of [docker pull](https://hub.docker.com/r/swalabtech/journiv-app) and many many [feature request](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/issues) (and bugs reports) on Github in just two weeks (sleepless two weeks for me :)).

[Journiv](https://journiv.com) is a self-hosted private journaling application that puts you in complete control of your personal reflections and memories

Journiv [v0.1.0-beta.8](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta.8) is out and in it I have added the most requested features.

**Highlights:**

* OIDC support (now pretty stable)
* In app [one click export-import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRpQbyExMU) with history. So you always have your memories safe and backed up even if you don't want to deal with docker backups
* Role Based Access Control for user management.
* Many quality of life features and bug fixes.
* Read the release notes [here](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta.8)

Journiv began as a deeply personal project, a way for me to capture memories, reflections, and the stories behind thousands of photos and videos (in immich, immich integration status below) of my fast-growing kids. What started as a tool for my own parenting journey has grown into something that fills a real gap in the self-hosting community. If you’re curious, you can read the full story behind Journiv [here](https://journiv.com/blog/the-story-behind-journiv).

I’m grateful that Journiv is now helping others preserve their memories as well.

**The Journey Ahead**

Journiv is in active development, with a fully functional backend, a web frontend, and mobile apps launching soon. It is self-hosted, and designed to be your companion for decades.

Journiv is being built because our memories deserve to be ours, forever.

**Immich Integration Staus**

* As you all know I have been working on the Immich integration, and you can see a preview of connecting to Immich and attaching media from it directly into Journiv in the attachment of the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1orsrbm/journiv_010beta4_with_oidc_is_out_and_a_sneak/) or [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fobtzdk_7tI).
* One of the architectural decision I had to made in this integration was whether to support linking or hard copy of immich assets. Supporting both is possible but increases complexity and maintenance burden over long run. So I wanted to do one.
* Thanks to everyone who provided their inputs and insights on this [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1orsrbm/journiv_010beta4_with_oidc_is_out_and_a_sneak/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1os8chw/journiv_immich_integration_how_would_you_like/), [3](https://github.com/orgs/journiv/discussions/64).
* From the feedback the conclusion was most people prefer link over copy.
* Thinking about this more in design process I realized that even with link only Journiv will still need to have support for downloading actual media files from Immich to support one click in-app import/export(launched above) so the linked Immich media is actually present in the export.
* Hence I prioritized the import and export first to build the immich support over it as doing it other way had higher chances of introducing backward incompatibility which I want to avoid.
* **TL;DR** stay tuned Immich support will be coming soon and will have both options to link and do hard copy at user profile level and switch between them.

Let me explain (brace yourselves for a not so abridged life story). I started my coffee journey this year in fact September. After a somewhat long hiatus from drinking this luscious beaned beverage (damn you to hell Covid), I happened across an awkward looking chappy on the YouTubes talking about filter coffee and grinders. All praise the Hoffmann. The one he was highlighting was the KinGrinder P0. Having my coffee taste buds returned my interest was piqued. I only ever drank flat whites or an espresso. So took the plunge and purchased this device (well P2 version as the P0 and P1 were out of stock on Bezzo’s shop!) and try this wonderful filter coffee these video harped on about. Well, I was surprised by how tasty my brews were. I started with a local roaster and before long began purchasing coffee from Dak, Scenery, Origin etc, and have not drank coffee with any milk in since.

Right back to the Ode 2. So, I got this based on a number of reviews and about the clarity of cup it produced for filter coffee. All hail the Hedrick. And that’s just it. My cups are clean, they are tasty, but they aren’t my P2 kinda funky and tasty. I sometimes throw a towel over the Ode to hide its gaze as I secretly use my P2. By the way this is not a complaint, I do like the cups I brew with the Ode. I guess every now and then I like a muddy brew (give me those fines!), especially when I drink Dak’s beans.

However, I noticed some positive stereotypes about non-binary people. For example:

1- The non-binary barista is often a cliche but it's good, because many people says (at least in joke) that ""You know coffee would be good if it was done by an enby with blue hair"".

2- Maybe not positive due its connotations but here in Latin America the stereotype is that non-binary people are usually rich or privileged (technically it's negative because it's usually used to people to depict us as ""burgois"", lazy or ""elite"").

So I have went to a lot of doctors (3 endocrinologist, 2 dermatologist, gastroenterologist, neurologist, psychologist, psychiatrist) the last 4-5 years. Why ? Because I feel anxious all the time (not panic attacks, but anxious, frustrated, angry), I can never enjoy anything what other ppl can. First my GP sent to a psychologist, who said its a generalized anxiety we did meditation and everything but nothing helped. Than it turned out that my THYROID, especially T3 hormone is elevated. I went to two different endocrinologist, but because its a ""pretty weird"" case. The doctors can't exactly ""announce"" that i have a thyroid disorder even tho for 6 years straight, 10 bloodworks, my T3 is always high. TSH and T4 is ok. At the end I convinced my endo to prescribe propranolol. I take like 30-40mg a day, so not much + 0.5mg xanax extended release. Its better but its still frustrating and it has a big negative impact on my life. I even went to psychiatrist and told her to prescribe me SSRI's i dont really care but do something (even tho i am really against SSRIs). She refused because she definietly told me I dont have depression, and she doesnt even think I have anxiety (def. not anxiety which needs medication)

My symptoms:

\- shaky hands  
\- sweaty palms and feet --> cold hands, cold feet  
\- bad memory, which nowdays now affect my speaking, I dont recall worlds, which is bad because im working in a high position  
\- I could always sleep. I'll easily sleep straight 14 hrs if I have the chance, but If i dont get the chance its also fine, thought that xanax causing it, but nope, even if I dont take it, its the same shit, plus 0.5mg in ""EXTENDED MODE"" is really weak   
\- I get angry and frustrated really easily  
\- acne  
\- oily skin & hair  
\- acid reflux  
\- low appetite (coffee fucks me up completely + even less appetite)  
\- it feels like my metabolic rate for food is really fast  
\- even doctors told me that medicines clear out from my system pretty quickly (when I was in anesthesia when they checked my belly, because 15 minutes after the procedure I wake up like nothing happened and im ready to go without any issues, this happened multiple times)  
\- my cortisol is always sky high 800+ nmol/l 

  
Today I went to the 3rd endocrinologist and he looked at my history because i gathered together everything with dates everything. He said that he can't state/announce that i have a thyroids issue, his best bet (even tho its early to say) is that I have vegetative dystonia. These symptoms for me shouting hyperthyroidosis, or something thyroid related. Obviously I did not want to be the ""smart"" one at the doctor, so obviously I will do the suggested bloodworks AGAIN + ultrasound, but I did these million times, its always elevated T3. 



Tbh Im just needing some help ... Before this endocrinologist I was living like this for 4 years with xanax and propranolol and even tho its better, I can see/feel that im just living a ""half life"". I can't enjoy things what others do because Im never able to enjoy the moment. I always trying to find other people with these symptoms but I never saw anyone. Im pretty good at observing because im a plant breeder, sooo... If this will be this vegetative dystonia I will be pretty disappointed, because nothing really to do against it as far as I know.

1p7fzj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1p7fzj4/my_fiancé_completely_changed_even_before_the/,My fiancé completely changed even before the wedding,"Hello Reddit, I'm looking for an outside opinion because my situation is a little beyond me at the moment.

I got engaged in June 2025 and my wedding is scheduled to take place in April 2026.

Although this is a bit irrelevant I need to set the context. I am a civil servant in Luxembourg and I earn a very good living there, my fiancé works in Strasbourg and has his own company in the construction industry. At the beginning we had common ground, common concessions for family life, and gradually I was a bit of a victim of brainwashing by his whole family and him continually implying to me that I would have to leave my job to go to Strasbourg. Long story short: I ended up being influenced enough to agree to try. But at the beginning, before this brainwashing phase, we agreed on the fact that I would keep my current position, not insignificant, and that there would come days when I had to be in the office and days when I had to telework we would be in Strasbourg (rather fair). Later my teleworking was reduced in general so we had to rethink all that, and it's simple: it's a constant competition... of who has the most things to lose, who has the most difficult situation. To this must be added a certain pressure from his mother (who wanted us to move in with her directly... except that it's not possible for me, you'll understand why).

Apart from the professional context, there are changes in behavior towards me: he was initially very attentive, always flowers and small gifts. Since the engagement these attentions have disappeared and worse, I feel very neglected. I'm not the type to beg for gifts, but the simple fact that he makes himself a coffee without offering me one, for example, remains a gesture that I have become accustomed to seeing from him (I tend to think of him before thinking of myself in these situations). Sometimes I go to his parents' house and they disappear into the basement for example without a word to me to ""send important documents"".. something he would never have done before. The most telling example remains my second hospitalization. During my first hospitalization, he was reassuring and caring. When he left, he came with flowers and chocolates. I had a more serious knee operation, and I was treated to a different face. Not a smile, looking tired and drunk at being there for me, always on his phone or making calls. Worse still, when he hung up and saw my face, his smile disappeared... the worst was leaving the hospital where I was carrying my own bags following a leg operation because he was typing text messages, I saw my future in this act and it was impossible.

I understood that his good mood was not about being in my presence but about having me in his usual circle (with or without me he is happy in Strasbourg). And he doesn't seem to be considering building a family with me either, but only adding me to his existing family. You should know that I already live alone far from my parents for the job I have held for 5 years as a civil servant, and he still lives with his parents. My city was in the center, it seems logical to settle there for balance? At least at the beginning it was possible. It's also possible that it's up to me to make the 1h40 round trip, but when I suggest the opposite, that our family life takes place in the city, it seems insurmountable.

I was able to agree to consider looking for work and therefore divide my salary by 3 because at the beginning, I believed what I heard, today I believe what I see. He is not able to support a family financially.

The other big problem remains... my future mother-in-law who feels so involved that she wants to know about the slightest of our arguments. The truth is that she is very fake with me and I know it because I have seen several times messages where she calls me ""elin kizi"" while in front of me it is ""my daughter my daughter"" and makes fun of me, and her son does not put her back... in short, she marks her territory and refuses that we live ""far away"" because she is sick and ""my parents have 3 daughters and she only has one son"" and a daughter that she does not obviously doesn't count? In short, she feels like she's in constant competition with me and it's... exhausting. These constant peaks etc. I should have turned on my heels at this first lack of respect. But over time, let's just say it gets worse and worse. He doesn't see evil, but as a woman I see these things. For the most shocking example: we were at a wedding and we were taking photos, and she put her hand on her crotch which she grabbed (I didn't see I thought it was on her thigh) and I found that so inappropriate. Later I said that I felt it was disrespectful to his fiance for his mother to do that publicly and he just said that she would do that to anyone. When I saw the photo and the position of the hand… shock! It was so inappropriate especially in public

The other thing (this is a lot) is that my mother-in-law really pushed for us to have a civil marriage much earlier than the norm. Today I wonder if he isn't a little interested in my finances. I was able to delay this. She also explained to me in the absence of her son that: the company does not belong to him, that she gave him so that he could later pay his loan. She implied a lot of things to me that were not to my fiancé's advantage (for example, I learned from her that he had already introduced a girl to his parents). But basically: he has to take care of his family. I've already spoken with him about this, he says that once he's married it will be over but I know not... he's far too dependent on his mother.

I have a pretty strong temperament so it’s true that when I had the misfortune of seeing women on his “professional” Instagram account I said that he was shaming me in front of my family. I don't want to imply that I'm not wrong, when I'm upset I can be mean and tell him, for example, that his payments are systematically refused, and that he couldn't support a family, or that he has a very feminine energy (that's the case, he's always the one to be pitied, he who suffers the most, who suffers the most). But unlike him, I haven't changed my behavior, I've always been like that, he knows it and he accepted it and I even liked him more over time. As for him, I have the impression that his love is fading.

Recently we had a rather heavy discussion and in the end, he put himself in the victim position, and said that everything was my fault (we must have had trouble communicating, instead of understanding he outdid himself by saying ""and me in all of this!! It's you who's pushing me into this, it's your fault, look at me as I am"" when I say I feel neglected and less loved). The ponpon remains that he is hiding behind the fact of being a business manager (he works alone it should be noted that he does not manage Amazon either) and that I do not “understand because I should find a man on permanent contract perhaps because I am not a real woman”

I would like your opinion on the overall situation. Today I discussed with my mother my intention to end this relationship, mainly explaining that he no longer wanted to come to my city and that I refused to go to his.

1p7fxud,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p7fxud/husband_says_i_kinkshamed_him_did_i/,Husband says I kink-shamed him. Did I?,"
Important information:

My husband and I (F) have been married (monogamous) for 25 years. We are a cis-het couple with two young adult children who no longer live at home.

His kink is feeding/feederism. He is currently not overweight, as he has a career that requires fitness. Please understand that this isn't fantasizing--this is something that he wants to do.

When he says ""fat"", he means 500 or more pounds. 

I am very much pro-body neutrality. I have never and will never judge someone based on their shape, size, or any other metric. I am also very far from being a trim and fit person.

I have absolutely no one else to talk to about this, as my husband is not ""out"" in any community.

Please don't focus on the kink. 

Yes this was a real conversation. Yes, I feel mortified that I'm on here asking total strangers to let me know if I fucked up my husband's life.

-------

The other night, we were discussing our sex life and my husband's kink came up. A while in (so this was not from the left field), I asked him if I could pose a hypothetical question to him and he said he'd be happy to answer. My hypothetical question was:

""If your physician told you that you needed to lose weight because of a medical condition that is causing you harm, would you lose weight?""

His answer: ""I only get to live once, right?""

My clarifying question: ""So your answer would be no?""

He nods yes.

Another question from me (I tell him this is not hypothetical, but serious and I would appreciate a serious answer): ""Would you rather be fat (remember his definition of ""fat"") and risk death or serious disability or give us the opportunity to grow old together?""

He did not answer. He did tell me that I was being a bitch, that I ""kink-shamed him and I may as well cram myself back in the closet"" and wants to know why I'm asking this ""years out"". I explained that I see these conversations similar to other big conversations with your partner: when to have kids, when to buy a house, retire, etc.

He told me that he's not even sure that I love him (I raised his children alone while he was in Afghanistan during the middle of the war). I have followed this man all over the country; I can pack an entire house to move in a day. I have loved him faithfully since the day I met him. I have supported his career, his hobbies, interests, weekend afternoons gaming with his buddies, all of it. We go to the ocean, the bookstore, coffee shops...I thought we were happy and content. 

He said that he's not sure if he's in love with me.

Did I ruin my marriage?

Blowout ensues. He eventually finds his way to the realization that he misunderstood me, but still insists that I kink-shamed him. Y'all, on my Mama's grave I never said anything disparaging to him. What did I do? 

Thank you in advance for treating this respectfully. I'm heartbroken.

I’d like to ask you out in person but we don’t exactly have any of the same classes so it’s hard. You know where to find me, though. Next time why don’t you come over and talk to me. I don’t bite, unless you’re into that.

1p7fuab,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p7fuab/any_advice_for_being_burnt_out_on_heartbreak/,Any advice for being burnt out on heartbreak?,"Hello,

  
I (29M) was broken up with by my Fiancé about 3 months ago. We were together 7 years, lived together for 3, and were engaged for about a year. The whole thing felt super abrupt. For context, we had just had our engagement photoshoot the day prior (Thursday). It was honestly a really nice time. We had it at our favorite breakfast spot we used to go to in college, and I remember her talking to the waitress about how we met and always go there together and it made me super happy. She then went out with some friends that night while I stayed home, and she didn't get home until after I went to bed. The next day (Friday), I went to work, and we texted back and forth the usual amount for a weekday, then she went radio silent for a couple of hours until I texted that i was driving home from work. When I got home, she just said that we needed to talk, and basically said that she had been unhappy for months, and had decided in her therapy appointment she had that day that she was going to end things. Of course, I begged and cried, but the decision had already been made before we even talked, so there wasnt much I could do. 

Luckily, my parents lived close by so I stayed with them that night, and stayed there until I found my new apartment. My ex opted to just finish out the lease at our shared apartment and pay rent herself. We had 3 cats together, 1 mine and 1 hers, and 1 we got together. She kept the 2 while I was going to keep mine. My dad is especially allergic to cats though so he stayed with my ex until I got my new place. This is relevant because it drove me to find a new apartment as soon as possible. Breakup happened at the end of august, and I found a place/signed a lease 2 weeks later to start on October 1st.

Fast forward to now and I feel like i've done a ton and changed a lot already. I started going to the gym and lifting consistently 4 days a week, reinvigorated a lot of the friendships that I admittedly let fall by the wayside for my relationship, and established a routine with new activities I had never done prior (reading a book at a coffee shop every Saturday, weekly Yoga classes, therapy, pretty much anything that would not remind me of my ex). 

So now, I have a new apartment that I spent a lot of time and money on putting together, a pretty established routine, and concerted efforts to be social at least a couple of times a week. Yet, I don't think i've gone a single day without breaking down and crying, or ruminating over the breakup. We've gone full no contact since we sorted out all of the wedding cancellation and apartment logistics, and I got off social media full stop because I knew it was killing my mental, even if the posts were not related to her. But a lot of times, it feels like the feelings and rumination are as strong as they were on day 1, and the only thing that's changed is now I do things in spite of it instead of letting it ruin my whole day. Some days I feel very angry at her and swear I'll never speak to her again, and others I just want to reach out and beg for her back.

I just feel so burnt out on feeling like this and I'm not sure how to remedy or lessen it. On top of losing who I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with, the sudden shift in the last 3 months of not just my relationship status, but where I live and what I do with my time has just been really taking a toll on me. Now with the holidays here I honestly don't know how I'm going to get through this in one piece. 

Does anyone have some advice for getting through this weird period of a breakup where its not really a new thing anymore but it feels like it still is? The initial shock of the whole thing has worn off but now I just feel like I'm in a state where I feel this stuff more clearly, which honestly feels worse. I'm just so tired of crying while I'm at home cooking or watching TV or reading, or suppressing the urge to cry while I'm out in public.",9,1764182655.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

I met this guy that lives in the apt building across the street from me about a year and a half ago on a hookup app. We ended up hitting it off and started hanging out/ dating I guess for a month or so after. Texting all day spending time together but nothing really official. One night while we were at the movies he says he has to go to meet a friend that he forgot to cancel on. After that night everything kind of changed. 

In the next few weeks all communication slowed down and it was like pulling teethto get him to go grab a coffee. He was starting an intense year long program at school in that same time period so i saw where it was headed and backed off. I didnt hear from him for like 2 months and moved on. Then he hit me up out of no where, we chatted and we ended up hooking up. Over the next year we hooked up on a weekly or bi weekly basis. 

A few weeks ago I had the courage to ask him what happened last year with the drop in communication. He told me he decided that he didnt want to start anything new since school was starting and he has a lot going on, which is understandable. So I made it known I was still interested and wouldn't mind hanging out again since school was done he said ok. Fast forward a few weeks i hit him up to come over and he tells me that he cant come because he is dating someone. I was a bit shocked but ultimately said ok cool and wish you the best and all that. 

But my feelings are kind of hurt. Is it normal to have hurt feelings in a situation like this?

I have a personal tradition I started when I turned 18 where I would go around to places that offer free stuff when it’s your birthday, if you have the app or a membership, and get myself treats and drinks to celebrate my own birthday without all the chaos of a party. I have done this for 5 years now and I always leave early in the morning so I can still do family or friends stuff later in the day, like going out or getting dinner. This year is a little different, since my birthday falls right on Thanksgiving, and since I’m visiting my mom for the holiday and have the day free I figured I would just do my tradition today. I told my girlfriend I was heading out and she said that since she was almost done getting ready for the day that I should wait and take her along with me. I agreed thinking it couldn’t hurt but mentioned that I would just be going to Chick-fil-A for a peppermint coffee and Nothing Bundt Cakes for a cake for myself. My mother had food and snacks at the house so I was planning on having my treats and cooking anything she wanted at the house when we got back since neither of us had had breakfast. She seemed ok with this and we headed out, and as soon as we get in the car she mentions wanting to go to the dollar tree for some things, which I agreed thinking to since it isn’t that far out of the way and what she needed would only take a minute to grab. I get my cake and we go to the dollar tree where she takes 30 minutes to browse and grab extra little things, which I’m used to but it still got me into a mood. She asked to go to target since it was in the parking lot but my mom wanted to go later so I said no. Now we’re both irritable. She proclaims that she’s hungry and we need to go to Popeyes and get the Freddy Fazbear meal, which I didn’t really want to do but was willing to make happen since it was less than 10 minutes away. We go to CFA first and while waiting in line for my frozen coffee I explain that I didn’t appreciate that my tradition which was meant to be my personal celebration of myself got turned into just another run-of-the-mill shopping/ food trip for her, and while I’m trying to tell her how I feel she shrinks down, rubbing her hands together, in what looks like a pity pose, and instead of comforting her for hurting my feelings, I mock her and exaggerate the pose and whimpers she was making. She got so mad that she demanded an apology and when I didn’t she said she didn’t want to eat anymore. I was fine with that since I could get home faster and since trying to talk had gotten me nowhere I just shut my mouth for the rest of the drive. She did the same after a minute of frustration driven comments and now I don’t know what to do. We got home and I’m enjoying what I got myself, as I believe I should since I’m celebrating another year on the earth, but she has gone into a locked room to sulk and I’m just wondering, am I the asshole?",3,1764182457.0,AITAH,38,0.61,False

* * *

## Pattern Analysis

### 1\. Concentrated Selling in a Handful of Names

  * **BROS, ATEC, and MTD** account for the **majority of dollar-value selling**.
  * Selling comes from **high-influence actors** : 10% holders, founders, executive chairmen, CFOs and senior regional heads.
  * The combination of **size** , **seniority** , and **clustering** (multiple trades in short windows) is what makes these signals stand out.



### 2\. Mixed but Selective Buying in Smaller / Mid-Cap Names

  * On the buy side, **no mega-cap tech names** appear; activity is focused on **smaller and mid-cap companies**.
  * Purchases are dominated by **AUR, DGICA, AP, NRDY, AMZE** , each featuring either a **CEO** or a **10% owner** stepping in with personal capital.
  * In several cases (AUR, NRDY, AMZE, AUID), insiders are increasing their stakes by **double-digit percentages** , which often signals stronger conviction than a token buy.



### 3\. Compensation & Plan-Driven Activity

  * **MTD** and **TFSL** show the familiar pattern of **options exercised (M)** and **restricted stock awards (A)** , sometimes paired with **partial sales** to lock in value or cover costs.
  * **PINC’s** “D-Return” cluster is sizeable in dollar terms but is structurally a capital-structure/plan adjustment, not an open-market decision.
  * These flows are important for context but carry **lower directional signal** than discretionary open-market buys/sells.



* * *

## Sector / Theme Observations

While today’s filings span multiple industries, a few themes stand out:

  * **Consumer / Services:** Heavy selling at a well-known coffee chain operator (BROS) stands out as a dominant single-name event.
  * **Healthcare / Med-Tech & Instruments:** ATEC (spine/orthopedic devices) and MTD (precision instruments and lab gear) both show **sizeable executive and 10% holder selling**.
  * **Software & Platforms:** INTA (vertical software) and NRDY (online learning) show **mixed signals** — management selling at INTA versus CEO buying at NRDY.
  * **Financials & Insurance:** DGICA, USCB, TFSL and other financial names exhibit a mix of **10% owner activity, awards, and moderate-size sales** , pointing more to portfolio rebalancing and compensation than clear sector-wide fear.



* * *

## Market Implications

  1. **Net message: de-risking at leaders, selective conviction in smaller names.**
     * The **-$47.1M net selling** is heavily concentrated in a few stocks, particularly BROS, ATEC and MTD.
     * When large 10% holders and CFO-level executives take tens of millions off the table, it often reflects **portfolio and liquidity management** , but it can also mark **confidence plateaus** after strong operational or share-price runs.
  2. **Insider confidence appears stock-specific, not broad-based.**
     * The presence of **CEO and 10% owner buying** in AUR, NRDY, DGICA, AMZE and AP suggests insiders still see **selective opportunity** , especially in **smaller or more volatile names**.
     * These are typically situations where insiders may feel the market is underestimating long-term optionality or near-term recovery potential.
  3. **Mechanical transactions soften the headline, but don’t flip the signal.**
     * Option exercises, equity awards, and share returns (MTD, TFSL, PINC) explain a meaningful slice of today’s gross dollar flow.
     * However, even stripping those out leaves **substantial net open-market selling** , so the **core directional message remains bearish for this snapshot**.



* * *

## Key Takeaways

  * **Net insider flow is clearly negative:** Open-market sales overwhelm purchases in both **count and dollar value** , led by BROS, ATEC, and MTD.
  * **Big sellers are powerful insiders:** 10% holders, founders, executive chairs and CFOs are the primary sellers, which raises the signal strength compared with routine junior-staff activity.
  * **Bullish signals are more idiosyncratic:** CEO and 10% owner buying in **AUR, DGICA, NRDY, AP, AMZE and others** highlight selective stories where insiders see mispricing or long-term upside.
  * **Compensation noise is present but manageable:** A-, M-, and D-type trades at **MTD, TFSL, PINC** are mostly mechanical and should be treated as **context, not core signals**.
  * **Focus on size and seniority:** The clearest flags come from **large, discretionary trades by top executives and 10% holders** , not from small awards or plan-driven flows.



🟢 **If this brings you value, sharing it helps me keep building the project.**

Her fingers brushed against the ring on his hand—and in that instant, memories came flooding back.
Just a few days ago, she'd seen the gossip online: Benjamin was about to marry the daughter of the Shelton Group's CEO.
Noticing she was distracted, he leaned down and gave her a long, intense kiss.
With her mind all foggy from passion, he slipped a bank card into her bra.
""Just be good for me. I'm getting married next month. Let's end this.""
Arabelle nodded obediently. ""Okay.""
Seeing that she didn't cry or make a scene, Benjamin frowned instead. ""You okay?""
Arabelle gave him a light and comforting laugh. ""I'm good.""
She had long moved past the point where his actions could hurt her.
Everyone who knew them could see that Arabelle was crazy about Benjamin, almost to the point of obsession.
She'd been chasing him since she was 18.
Right after graduation, she joined the Chantler Group and became his secretary.
During the day, she helped him out at work without a hitch. At night, she was right there in bed with him.
Whenever trouble came up, she'd jump in front of him like a shield. When it came to parties and drinks, she'd step up to take shots for him.
She always carried three notebooks in her bag filled with all his likes and dislikes. The moment he gave her a look, she knew exactly what he needed.
For seven years, she followed him—without a title, without a promise. Only recently had people begun to change their tone.
Instead of calling her foolish, they'd smile and ask when the wedding news would come.
No one could believe she'd just sit back and watch him marry someone else. Not even Benjamin.
What they didn't know, though, was that a week earlier, Arabelle had already said yes to her parents' request to head back to her hometown for a blind date.
***
She first met Benjamin when she was 18.
One day, she got a call from her mother.
""Belle! Your dad was in a car crash. He's in the ER— it's bad. You need to come home right now... before it's too late.""
Arabelle's mind went completely blank.
In a panic, she rushed out and accidentally crashed into Benjamin's car.
Luckily, he hit the brakes just in time. She wasn't hurt too badly. After getting up, she limped toward the hospital as fast as she could.
Benjamin stopped her. After asking what happened, he made a quick phone call and then drove her there himself.
When they got there, the hospital director quickly led in the best team for surgery—and somehow managed to bring her dad back from the brink of death.
Arabelle and her mother held each other tight, their faces wet with tears of joy.
Through her blurry eyes, she spotted Benjamin standing a little way off, quietly thanking the hospital director.
That was when she realized he was the one who'd asked the director to come.
At that moment, the young man in the light, calm and serious, felt like a god who'd appeared in her life.
At first, all Arabelle wanted to do was thank him.
That was why she'd been by his side, trying to find small ways to show her appreciation for what he'd done.
After graduation, she joined the Chantler Group and somehow ended up sleeping with him one night. Then she became his personal secretary.
Over time, her feelings changed.
During those rare moments when he showed her kindness, she found herself having desires that felt a bit too greedy for comfort.
It was only a month ago that Benjamin suddenly started acting really cold toward her.
Feeling uneasy, she hesitated for quite a while.
After one close moment together, she finally gathered the courage to ask carefully, ""Mr. Chantler, did I do something wrong?""
Benjamin's icy, serious eyes narrowed at her.
After what felt like forever in silence, he replied, ""I'm just kind of tired of this.""
Arabelle's face went pale. Under his indifferent stare, she hurried away in embarrassment.
That same day, Benjamin left for a business trip overseas. For the first time, he didn't take her—his personal secretary—along with him.
The next day, she stumbled upon the news that he was engaged to Adelina Shelton.
When he returned a week later, there was an extra wedding ring on his finger.
That was when it hit her.
All good things have to come to an end, and it was time for her to say goodbye to Benjamin.
Benjamin had already moved out, leaving her the apartment where she'd lived for seven years.
Arabelle quickly reached out to a real estate agent to put it up for sale.
The apartment was in a great location, and she priced it way lower than what others were asking. The agent marketed it as a top listing, and that very night, someone came by to check it out and put down a deposit.
After signing the contract, the agent beamed at her. ""Ms. Greyle, the buyer is paying in full! We should wrap everything up in about a week.""
Arabelle paused for a second, then smiled and nodded.
""Alright, thanks!""
After the agent left, she started packing up the apartment.
The little lucky cat figurine on the shoe cabinet had been there since her first day moving in.
Benjamin used to joke about that cat figurine. But as soon as she turned around, he pushed her against the shoe cabinet and kissed her like he couldn't get enough.
He playfully nibbled on her earlobe while his deep voice rumbled with laughter.
""You believe this little thing can bring you luck? I can do a better job than it.""
The living room carpet was something he'd spotted at a mall during one of their overseas trips together.
He just whipped out his card and bought it right then and there. It took over half a month to arrive from across the ocean.
Once she unpacked it, he started unbuttoning her clothes with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
""When I first saw this carpet, I thought it looked very comfy to lie on.""
On the single-seat couch in the corner, he had a rare moment of softness. Once, he held her in his arms when she was sick and comforted her gently.
The razor in the bathroom was the first gift she ever gave him, and he used it for years.
On the title page of ""Business Warfare Strategies,"" the book on the far left of the shelf, there was a quick sketch of her that he drew on a whim. It was not perfect but really captures her essence.
Seven years felt like such a long time.
Long enough that even someone as proud and distant as Benjamin made unforgettable memories with her all over this place.
Arabelle went through her things, keeping some and discarding others.
But eventually, she just collapsed into the mess of scattered items, crying uncontrollably.
Chapter 2
She cried all night.
The next morning, she put some ice on her eyes for half an hour and then slathered on a thick layer of foundation. It was only then did her eyelids finally stop looking so puffy and red.
She pulled out the resignation letter she had written ages ago and headed straight to the office.
As soon as she sat down at her desk, she noticed all her coworkers in the department giving her those subtle, sympathetic looks.
Before Arabelle could ask what was up, Benjamin's office door swung open.
Adelina stepped out.
She was rocking a fancy custom dress with flawless makeup. She carried herself with that effortless elegance of someone from a wealthy family, moving around the office like she owned the place.
Arabelle finally figured out why her coworkers were giving her those sideways looks.
Everyone thought she was going to be the future wife of their boss.
But just like that, Benjamin got engaged, and her situation became awkward.
When Adelina spotted her, though, she didn't seem upset at all.
With a sweet smile on her face, she handed over an invitation to Arabelle and warmly invited her.
""Good morning, Ms. Greyle! Benjamin and I are having our engagement party in a week. I came here just to hand out invitations.
""You've worked with Benjamin the longest. We'd love for you to join us!""
Arabelle quickly put on a polite smile and took the invitation from Adelina with both hands.
""Congratulations to you, Ms. Shelton, and Mr. Chantler.""
Adelina kept her smile as she leaned in a bit closer, lowering her voice to a whisper just for the two of them.
""I heard you thought you could marry into the Chantler family? How ridiculous.
""Benjamin was just using you to practice. Otherwise, how would he keep me happy after we're married?
""Open your eyes and see how big the gap is between us. Just give up on this silly dream already.""
She maintained that smile throughout, acting all friendly. Anyone who didn't catch their chat would have thought they were just sharing some light gossip.
Arabelle stayed calm on the outside, but her fingers tightened around the invitation until her knuckles turned white.
She understood why Adelina was acting like this—who would want their husband's ex hanging around? Still, there was an uncomfortable knot tightening in her chest.
Arabelle pressed her lips together and decided to lower herself even more.
""Don't worry, Ms. Shelton. I know my place.""
There was a cold edge behind Adelina's smile.
""I hope so. But honestly, I've never been one to bet on whether people know how to behave.""
In the next moment, she grabbed Arabelle's hand and suddenly stumbled backward. Before Arabelle could react, Adelina fell straight to the floor.
After letting out a sharp cry of pain, she looked up at Arabelle with wide eyes.
""Ms. Greyle, I invited you to our engagement party. Why did you just push me down?""
The office door swung open, and Benjamin stepped out with long strides.
When he saw Adelina lying on the ground, he rushed over to help her up.
""Adelina, what happened?""
Adelina looked up at him, her eyes red and puffy. ""I was just giving Ms. Greyle the invitation for our engagement party and asking if she could come. But out of nowhere, she got upset, pushed me away, and told me to leave.""
Benjamin shot a glance at Arabelle, his eyes cold.
Arabelle frowned and quickly tried to explain, ""I didn't...""
But Benjamin cut her off sharply.
Turning back to Adelina, he asked, ""What kind of status does she even have? Is it really worth you coming all this way just to invite her?""
The room went silent. His harsh words hit Arabelle like a punch in the gut for a moment.
Adelina paused for a second but then quickly put on a smile and playfully whined at Benjamin.
""But she's your chief secretary! I just thought I'd help you keep talented people around.""
Benjamin scooped her up into his arms and headed toward the office.
As he walked, he said with a bit of authority, ""You're the future wife of this company's boss. No one's more important than you.
""Where did you twist your ankle? Let me take a look.""
Arabelle stood there, frozen with a blank look on her face, watching them walk away.
Adelina was really rushing. She couldn't even wait for Arabelle to hand in her resignation letter. But honestly, with such clumsy acting, how could Benjamin not see through it?
Still, he chose to have her back.
They were all adults here. Fairness couldn't be obtained just by throwing fits or crying about it.
A heavy feeling settled in Arabelle's chest as she calmly pulled out her resignation letter.
Just when she was about to go in and ask Benjamin to sign it, he suddenly walked out.
He stood tall and straight, his clothes fluttering a bit as he moved. His long fingers tapped lightly on her desk, and he said bluntly, ""Adelina doesn't want to see you. So just resign.
Benjamin's cold, hard gaze showed no emotion at all.
Arabelle's heart raced for a moment, and she tightened her grip on the resignation letter she'd prepared that morning.
After seven years of working hard at the Chantler Group, she never thought she'd be leaving like this in such a humiliating way.
A bitter smile crept onto her face as she nodded slowly.
""Alright.""
Her calm acceptance with no tears and no shouting, sparked a surprising bit of annoyance in Benjamin's chest.
He frowned. ""Just leave today. I'll have the finance team give you double what you're owed.""
Arabelle smiled faintly. ""Got it. Thanks, Mr. Chantler.""
Benjamin turned and walked away without looking back.
Chapter 3
Arabelle sat back down at her desk, ripped up the resignation letter she no longer needed, and submitted her resignation through the company system.
Maybe Benjamin had already given HR a heads-up. Her resignation got approved almost right away, and it was quickly sent over to Benjamin for his final confirmation.
Not long after that, a notification popped up on Arabelle's screen. ""Your resignation application has been approved.""
At the same time, a large sum of severance pay landed in her bank account.
She hurriedly packed up her stuff. As she walked out with her things in hand, she passed by Benjamin's office.
The door wasn't fully shut. There was just a little crack.
Through that gap, she spotted Benjamin inside, head down as he looked over some papers. Adelina was sitting next to him, enjoying a dessert.
She took a bite herself and then scooped another spoonful of dessert and offered it to Benjamin. ""You've gotta try this. It's so good!""
Benjamin took a bite of the cake with the spoon that Adelina had used without hesitation. ""It's pretty good.""
Arabelle glanced at his face and gave a wry smile.
On her first day at work, she found out that Benjamin had two hard-and-fast rules.
First off, he was a germaphobe and never shared utensils with anyone.
At first, he wouldn't even kiss her in bed.
Their first kiss only happened because she was running a high fever. Her mind was all foggy from it, and when she talked to him, their lips accidentally brushed against each other. She went pale with shock, but he just leaned down casually and kissed her.
Back then, Arabelle thought she was special to him.
Secondly, he really didn't like sweet stuff.
After being with him for seven years, she had never seen him touch anything sugary. Even when she treated herself to some cakes now and then, he wouldn't even look at them.
She had memorized all his likes and dislikes. She filled up three thick notebooks with notes because she was scared that even the tiniest mistake would annoy him.
But it turned out her ""secret rulebook"" was just a big joke.
When he met the right person, he was willing to tolerate everything.
So, pulling out that heavy notebook, Arabelle let out a laugh at herself before tossing it in the trash without thinking twice and walked away.
Benjamin looked up from his papers. Through the crack in the door, he caught a quick glimpse of someone familiar rushing by, and for a moment, it threw him off.
When Arabelle got home, she told a few friends that she had decided to quit her job and head back to her hometown. They made plans to grab dinner the next day.
She thought she'd never see Benjamin again in her life. But surprisingly, as she followed the waiter toward their private room, she spotted someone familiar on the second floor out of the corner of her eye.
It was Benjamin and his friend leaning against the railing, smoking away.
With his back turned to her and a faint red glow from the cigarette between his fingers, there was an unexpected touch of loneliness about him.
Arabelle only stole a glance at him before looking down quickly, pretending not to notice him.
But then she heard Benjamin talking to someone else carried over by the wind.
She could make out his friend's voice asking, ""Are you really thinking about marrying Adelina? Ms. Greyle has been around for so long. We all figured you'd end up with her.""
Benjamin's tone was flat. ""I never thought about it.""
His friend chuckled and teased, ""Well, aside from her family not being the best, Ms. Greyle is gorgeous, knows how to handle things, and has been totally devoted to you. After all this time, you've never felt anything for her?""
Benjamin went quiet for a couple of seconds. Then his cold, indifferent voice floated over to her on the breeze.
""How could I ever let myself catch feelings for a plaything?""
Arabelle froze. The blood drained from her face.
When she caught the waiter's curious gaze on her, she dug her nails into her palm and slowly followed along.
She ate without tasting a thing. Her friends were all college roommates who knew about her feelings for Benjamin over the years.
When they found out she was heading back home, they felt both happy for her and sorry for what she'd gone through. The group hugged each other tightly and cried together.
After the lively crowd thinned out, Arabelle watched as her friends got picked up one by one by their husbands or boyfriends. Once again, she was left all alone.
She tightened her grip on her bag strap and was about to head out when her phone suddenly rang.
Glancing at the screen, she saw it was Benjamin calling. She reached to hang up, but accidentally hit ""answer"" instead.
Frowning and ready to end the call right away, she heard a voice on the other end that she didn't recognize.
""Hi there, is this Ms. Arabelle Greyle?""
Arabelle paused for a second. ""Yes, this is her.""
The caller replied politely, ""Ms. Greyle, Mr. Chantler has had too much to drink. Could you come pick him up? We're at...""
Benjamin was never the type to go overboard with drinking. Given his status, not many would even think about pushing him to drink more.
""So how did he end up drunk?""
Arabelle didn't really question why the waiter called her. She just replied in a distant voice, ""Sorry, but I can't come right now. Please get in touch with his fiancée to pick him up.""
As soon as she hung up, she heard the waiter on the other end gasp in shock.
""Mr. Chantler! Mr. Chantler, what's wrong? Mr. Chantler!""
The call ended abruptly.
Arabelle's expression changed instantly, and panic washed over her like a wave. Before she could fully wrap her head around what was going on, her body had already taken off toward the second floor.
She burst into the private room and shouted anxiously, ""Benjamin!""
When the door to the private room swung open, Benjamin was slouched in his chair, looking all dark and moody. His right hand was covered in blood, bright red and shiny.
Broken glass was scattered all over the table and around his feet.
The waiter stood nearby, fidgeting with worry on his face.
But Benjamin seemed completely unfazed, like he wasn't even the one hurt.
When he heard her voice, he turned to look at her, his eyes deep and shadowy.
His voice came out rough, with a hint of something almost like grievance.
""Didn't you say you weren't coming?""
Chapter 4
Arabelle let out a quiet sigh. ""Let me take care of your wound first.""
Benjamin didn't say yes or no.
He was acting a bit strange. As Arabelle got closer, she caught a strong smell of alcohol on him and figured he must have been pretty drunk.
He probably forgot that she wasn't his secretary anymore.
The waiter, looking relieved, quickly went to fetch the restaurant's first-aid kit.
Having been by Benjamin's side for years, Arabelle had made it a point to learn quite a bit about first aid for all sorts of unexpected situations, so she knew what she was doing.
She leaned in closer and when she saw his palm—a messy mix of blood and flesh—her brows knitted together instinctively.
""It might sting a little, just hang in there.""
""Okay.""
Arabelle carefully pulled out the pieces of glass stuck in his palm, put some medicine on the cut, and then, almost like she was calming a child, instinctively leaned down and blew gently on it.
The man sitting at the head of the table watched her gentle profile with focus, his throat gulped.
When she finished wrapping his hand neatly, she tied a small, careful bow to hold it all together.
She looked up at him with a smile. ""Mr. Chantler, all done with the bandaging...""
But before she could finish her sentence, Benjamin suddenly reached out with his good hand, grabbed her jaw, and leaned down to kiss her.
His kiss was hot and intense, full of emotions that were hard to explain.
Arabelle's eyes went wide, and she stared at him in shock.
In the next second, she didn't think twice before shoving at his chest with both hands.
But it was her who ended up losing her balance and falling to the floor. Her gaze stayed locked on him, filled with panic.
""Benjamin...""
He looked down at her, his voice rough. ""Arabelle, you know... you don't have to go.""
A sudden sharp pain shot through her chest.
He had pushed her away just yesterday, and now he was saying she could stay?
Just a moment ago, he even told someone else that she was just a toy for him to play with.
She could see the desire in his eyes clearly, which only made this whole situation feel totally absurd and ridiculous.
""Benjamin, we're done. You said so yourself.
""If you keep hanging onto me like this... I might start thinking you've actually fallen for me.""
Benjamin's pupils shrank suddenly, and the emotions in his eyes vanished right away, turning icy cold.
Out of nowhere, a phone rang.
Arabelle glanced over and saw Adelina's name pop up on the screen.
She raised her voice a bit. ""Mr. Chantler, your fiancée is trying to reach you.""
Benjamin looked down at the phone screen, his face going completely stone-cold.
""Get out.""
Arabelle quickly got up from the floor and rushed out of the private room.
As soon as she stepped through the door, she heard what sounded like a phone being smashed behind her. She hesitated for just a moment but didn't look back and just kept walking straight ahead.
Outside the restaurant, she quickly flagged down a taxi and hopped in.
As the car pulled away, she caught sight of the driver's unsure glance in the rearview mirror.
Arabelle blankly pulled out a mirror and took a look at herself—only then did she notice that Benjamin's kiss had smudged her lipstick, leaving marks on the corners of her mouth. She looked completely disheveled.
In a daze, she remembered that one time when Benjamin hardly ever stayed over at her place.
The next morning, they got up together to head to work. Arabelle was huddled by the vanity, rushing through her makeup to save some time. It wasn't until she was almost done that she realized Benjamin had been standing right behind her without her even noticing.
Feeling playful, he picked out a tube of lipstick for her and gestured like he wanted to put it on for her.
Worried about being late, Arabelle didn't think twice. She pouted her lips and went along with him as he traced the shape of them.
With two fingers from one hand, he lifted her chin to get her to look up at him. With his other hand, he held the lipstick and carefully applied it to her lips.
Even after he was done putting on the lipstick, he didn't let go of her jaw.
A bit of confusion flickered in her eyes as she met his gaze. She noticed that his expression was serious and intense, and he was looking right at her.
""What's up? Is it not finished yet?""
As soon as she said that, he kissed her, cutting off any further words.
When Benjamin finally pulled back, the lipstick he'd just put on had smudged all over—messy but somehow still sweet and tempting.
Arabelle let out a quick gasp and rushed to fix her swollen lips.
In the same mirror, the guy who caused it all was grinning like he found it hilarious.
As he casually wiped away the red lipstick smudge from the corner of his mouth, he chuckled in a deep voice.
""Weren't you the one who made that pouty face first, asking for a kiss?""
When she finally snapped back to reality, Arabelle looked at her reflection in the mirror—tears were already streaming down her cheeks.
Chapter 5
The next day, as soon as Arabelle woke up, she got a message from an old coworker.
""Arabelle, I found a necklace at your old desk. Do you still want it?""
Her colleague even sent a photo with the message.
Arabelle clicked on the picture and realized it was the birthday gift her mother had given her two years ago—a piece she had always loved.
She figured she must have left it behind in her rush to leave when she quit. So, she quickly made plans to meet her former coworker for lunch.
Arabelle got there early. She just arrived at the restaurant she used to go to during workdays and ordered some food when suddenly, out of nowhere, she spotted Adelina walking over from not too far away.
Gone was the sweet smile that Adelina usually wore. Instead, her face looked cold as she headed straight for Arabelle.
Arabelle couldn't help but frown. ""You...""
Before she could finish her sentence, Adelina suddenly raised her hand and slapped Arabelle hard across the face.
Along with the slap, Adelina shouted at the top of her lungs, ""You bitch! You've already been kicked out of the company. How dare you still try to steal my fiancé!""
The restaurant went completely silent in an instant, and everyone turned to stare at them in shock.
Arabelle was knocked sideways by the force of the slap. When she finally came back to reality, she realized that Adelina was just taking out her anger on her because of what had happened last night.
A sharp, stinging pain shot across her cheek. Around them, whispers quickly spread among the crowd.
""Is this a showdown with a home-wrecker? So dramatic!""
""Good for her! She's so pretty. Why would she want to be someone's mistress?""
""Aren't those Ms. Shelton from the Shelton family and Ms. Greyle, the ex-secretary? I heard Ms. Greyle was Mr. Chantler's girlfriend for years. Now that she's out of favor, the real girlfriend is coming after her. How sad!""
""Sad? What does she even have compared to Adelina? Does she really think she can compete with a Shelton heiress for a guy?""
Arabelle felt her whole body tremble as she locked eyes with Adelina, who looked ready to pounce. She bit down on her lip hard, bent down to grab her bag, and turned to walk away.
But Adelina wasn't having any of it. She looked super smug as she shot back with a cold warning.
""Arabelle, girls like you are everywhere. I could easily grab a bunch of you!
""Don't fool yourself into thinking you're special just because you've been with Benjamin for seven years! Back in the day, you'd just be another servant warming his feet!
""Let me give you a heads-up. Stay out of my way and Benjamin's. If not, I can make sure you're out of the Chantler Group in no time, and I'll also see to it that you can't stick around New York for even one more day!""
Arabelle's face went completely icy. She turned to look straight at Adelina.
""Ms. Shelton, don't worry about me. Benjamin and I haven't been tied together for ages now. I've already agreed to go back home for a blind date since my parents asked me to.
""Instead of coming here to throw threats at me, maybe focus on keeping your man in check and tell him to stop bothering me!""
She casually brought up her plan to leave, but when Adelina heard it, she totally misinterpreted it as Arabelle bragging about how Benjamin had reached out to her first.
Adelina's expression got even worse, a nasty look flashing across her face.
""Going back home for a blind date? Sounds more like you're heading back to pick up some tricks from your mom on how to snag guys!
""I heard your dad got into a car accident and now he can't use one of his legs. What a shame.
""How did your single mom manage to raise you? I bet she had to sell herself just to make ends meet.
""You grew up around that kind of stuff, which is why you think it's okay to go after someone else's fiancé. Like mother, like daughter!""
Adelina's voice was sharp and grating. Arabelle couldn't take it anymore.
""Shut up!""
She grabbed the coffee cup in front of her and splashed it right onto Adelina's face.
Coffee stains were all over Adelina, from her head to her toes. She looked at Arabelle in shock, yelled out loud, and shook with anger.
""Arabelle, how could you splash me like that? You're such a jerk. I won't let you get away with this!""
Arabelle's expression was icy and serious. ""If you keep talking trash, I won't just splash you. I'll hit you too!""
Just as she finished saying that, Benjamin walked in through the restaurant door.
He took one look at what was happening inside and headed straight for them.
Adelina immediately started crying and complained to him. ""Benjamin, I was just having a little chat with her when she threw coffee all over me.""
Arabelle's face turned bright red with rage. ""You were the one who insulted my family first—
Before she could finish her sentence, Benjamin grabbed a glass of iced water from a passing waiter.
With one quick motion, he poured the iced water right over Arabelle's head.
That cut off whatever else Arabelle wanted to say and completely snuffed out any last bit of affection she had for him in that moment.
Chapter 6
The cold water dripped down from her hair and soaked into her clothes, making her shiver.
Her hair stuck to her face, and the wet fabric of her outfit showed the outline of her underwear. She looked like a total mess.
Benjamin stared into Arabelle's eyes, which were filled with tears but she was holding back how she really felt.
""Just apologize to Adelina.""
That was always Benjamin's way.
He didn't care about what was right or wrong. He just wanted to protect whoever he chose.
After a moment of surprise, Adelina next to them quickly put on a smug look. She shot a challenging glare at Arabelle, waiting for an apology.
Arabelle spoke in a daze. ""What if... I don't?""
Benjamin's face was cold and hard. ""If you mess with my fiancée, I'll make sure you can never stay in New York again. And good luck trying to use that card of yours.""
Arabelle let out a bitter laugh.
They all thought she was with him for the money. They figured she couldn't bear to leave behind the glitz of this big city and would hang on no matter how tough it got. But they had no clue that she stuck around here just because of him.
And about that money...
Her hands shook as she dug into her bag. She pulled out the card Benjamin had given her once and set it down on the table.
""Here's your money back.
""I'm not sticking around in New York anymore.
""Anyway, I'm heading back to my hometown soon for a blind date.""
When Benjamin heard the words ""blind date,"" his eyes widened in shock.
Arabelle turned around and started to walk away. But just a couple of steps in, everything went dark for her, and she stumbled forward, nearly falling over.
In her ears, she could faintly hear Benjamin's worried voice.
""Arabelle!""
When Arabelle came to again, she found herself in a hospital room.
Benjamin was sitting by her bedside, his gaze as deep and cold as an icy lake, filled with mixed emotions as he stared at her.
As soon as he noticed she was awake, he tossed a medical report right at her.
Arabelle picked up the report, feeling totally confused, but her face went pale as soon as she saw ""6 weeks pregnant"" printed on it.
Lately, she hadn't been hungry at all, and her period was late.
She thought it was just some hormonal stuff from stress and didn't really think much of it. Never in a million years did she imagine... that it would turn out to be a pregnancy.
Next to her, Benjamin's voice was icy and sarcastic, filled with anger like he felt tricked.
""Arabelle, I thought you were at least somewhat decent. I never expected you to be bolder than anyone else, keeping something this huge from me behind my back.""
He leaned in closer to look at her, his sharp gaze putting a lot of pressure on her, and there was a smirk on his lips that dripped with sarcasm.
""Are you really going back for a blind date... or are you secretly planning to have my baby?""
Arabelle clutched the medical report in her hand, feeling completely helpless no matter what she said, ""I just found out too...""
She went quiet as soon as those words slipped out.
The cold sarcasm in Benjamin's eyes made it clear. He didn't buy it.
He stood tall and looked down at her pale face, his presence looming over her.
""Arabelle, my child can only come from my wife.
""Any kid carried by another woman is just an unwanted mistake that shouldn't even be here.
""I've set up the abortion for tomorrow.""
With that, he turned and walked out of the room without looking back.
She had never really had a choice.
Arabelle stared blankly at his disappearing figure, tears blurring her vision.
She curled up tight around herself and buried under the quilt, sobbing hard.
After Benjamin left, probably worried that she might try to escape, he had two bodyguards posted at the door.
When Arabelle followed the nurse for her pre-op checks, those bodyguards were right there with her every step of the way.
Arabelle stayed up all night.
The next day, while waiting for the abortion, she got a bunch of videos from Adelina on her phone.
Arabelle took a quick look and realized they were clips from Adelina and Benjamin's engagement ceremony.
Benjamin was in a black suit, looking tall and sharp, giving off a gentle and classy vibe.
A slight smile was on his face as he wrapped his arm around Adelina, accepting congratulations from guests one after another.
Adelina's face lit up with a big smile as she snuggled in his arms, stealing affectionate glances at him every now and then.
Just then, a young nurse knocked on the door to remind her.
""Ms. Greyle, it's almost time for your surgery.""
Arabelle put down her phone and nodded slowly.
""Okay.""
Not too far away in a fancy banquet hall, he was grinning like it was springtime while getting engaged to someone else. Meanwhile, she found herself in the cold, quiet hospital being led into the operating room.
With a heavy heart, she spread her legs and let the cold scalpel cut through the last connection they had left.
An hour later, Arabelle was rolled out of the operating room, her face as pale as a ghost.
She lightly touched her flat stomach. There was nothing there to feel, but it felt like something really painful, something that had sunk deep into her bones, was being ripped away from her.
Every breath she took sent a jolt of pain through her body.
Back in her ward, she changed into her own clothes and headed straight for the hospital exit.
The bodyguards raised their hands to stop her.
Arabelle said calmly, ""Benjamin told you to keep an eye on me because he thought I might try to run away before the surgery. Now that your job is done, you can go back and report.""
The two bodyguards exchanged glances and then called Benjamin. But it was Adelina who picked up the phone.
Her voice dripped with annoyance, ""Why are you talking about her right now? This is so irritating, just let her go.""
After leaving the hospital, Arabelle headed straight home.
She handed over the apartment to the buyer, grabbed her packed luggage from earlier that morning, and made a beeline for the airport.
Her old colleague, who had tricked her into going to that restaurant, sent an apologetic text.
""I'm really sorry. Adelina forced me into it.""
Arabelle didn't hold it against her but chose not to reply. She just tapped to block and delete the contact.
She did the same for Adelina, who kept sending videos of the engagement ceremony just to get under her skin.
Finally, she blocked Benjamin too. Ever since she added him as a contact, she just couldn't bring herself to delete any of his messages, no matter how many times she switched phones.
As soon as the plane took off, Arabelle let a faint smile creep onto her face.
""Benjamin, you saved my dad's life, and now I've given one back to you. From here on out, I don't owe you anything.
""Goodbye... and hopefully, never again.""

I spent a good amount of time looking at different options, testing them out, and reading up on reviews. The best one to come out of all that research is the [MuellerLiving French Press](http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO374). The 34oz size is perfect for making a decent amount of coffee without being too bulky, and the double insulation keeps your coffee hot for a good while. One of the things I like is how versatile it is—not just for coffee, but you can also use it for tea or hot chocolate if you're in the mood for something different.

The design is pretty straightforward, and the 4-level filtration system makes sure that your coffee doesn’t have a bunch of grounds floating around. It’s also super easy to clean, which is a huge plus, especially if you're not into spending too much time maintaining it.

I did look into a few other options like the Bodum or Secura French presses. The Bodum is great, but it’s kinda fragile, and Secura’s good for durability but doesn’t have the same insulation, so your coffee cools off faster. So it’s a bit of a trade-off.

Regression is killing me, and killing our marriage (arguing in the MOTN during wakeups because he wants me to cosleep and I don't find it comfy/it's kicking the can down the road and will make it harder to pull back for independent sleep). Tried a couple nights of Ferber and struggled listening to baby cry, then she got sick and had to stop. Needed something to buy me some time to figure out a plan, so bought this suit after a lot of hemming and hawing. 

I am SHOCKED. She still has the Moro reflex despite being in a sleep sack for like 3-4 weeks, with the added fun of constantly bringing her legs up and slamming them down which wakes her + those little hands. Usually when she sleeps we cannot do ANYTHING in the kitchen or adjacent rooms (live in a condo) because she will literally wake up with the slightest disturbance despite sound machine + fan. It never used to be like this, but thanks regression. 

Anyway, Ive tried this thing for every nap so far today and not only did she fall asleep and stay asleep in it WHILE I was talking to my mom ON SPEAKERPHONE, she also stayed asleep for over an hour (was taking 28-45 min naps before, usually 30-35 mins) with zero resettling required AND I was able to cook myself breakfast, grind coffee beans, etc, with no wakeups? MAGIC. 

I'm not looking forward to her learning how to roll in the suit (rendering it unusable) which will probably come in the next 3-6 weeks, but it might buy me enough time to figure out a solid sleep training plan (because currently I have like zero time to read up on this stuff with the short naps and shitty night sleep).

1p7fit1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1p7fit1/trip_report_october_418_northern_vietnam_hanoi_ha/,Trip Report: October 4-18 Northern Vietnam (Hanoi - Ha Giang - Cao Bang - Ninh Binh),"It's been just over a month since I returned from my trip so I thought I'd sit and write something up in case it's helpful for future travellers. 

**Off the top**

* I was travelling solo, 33F from Canada. This was my fourth trip to Asia so I felt pretty relaxed going in. I had been to Thailand and Japan (each more than once), and also Cambodia. What I was hoping to get out of Vietnam was something novel and see some incredible scenery.
* I relied on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) for hotels and I booked my Ha Giang loop tour with [Lila Inn Tours](https://lilainn.tours/). I found them because they were one of the few companies that offered itineraries that included the Ban Gioc falls. 
* I picked up an eSim from TravelKon -- 5gb for 15 days, just under $30 CAD. I don't think I had any connectivity issues, even when I was out on the road on the boonies. 
* I relied on Grab for taxis, and generally without issue. I only encountered problems in Cao Bang, but more on that later. 
* Almost every business I interacted with relied on WhatsApp for general communication 

**Itinerary**

* October 4-6: Hanoi, Old Quarter
   * Stayed at Classic Street Hotel: right in the heart of the Old Quarter, the location was great! However this is listed as a 4 star hotel and it certainly is not, I found the accommodations quite unpleasant but I sucked it up. The room I requested wasn't available so I was offered a downgrade at a lower price. In the Old Quarter especially, be prepared to compromise -- buildings are old and narrow, you'll often find rooms without windows, the streets are very noisy and you're constantly hearing horns honking. Bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper. 
   * The Old Quarter is fun to explore. I happened to catch the Full Moon Festival which was fun, but also quite crowded. 
   * Booked a walking food tour with [Ella](https://www.ellashanoifoodtour.com) which was a great crash course in some Vietnamese dishes I otherwise wouldn't have tried. 
* October 7-8: Hanoi, Old Quarter
   * So my original plan was for the [7-day Ha Giang loop - Cao Bang - Ba Be tour](https://lilainn.tours/tour/7-day-ha-giang-loop-cao-bang-ba-be/) with Lila; however, a typhoon came in on the Monday/Tuesday so adjustments had to be made! I ended up delaying my departure for Ha Giang to October 9th and just riding out the rain in Hanoi. I booked a different hotel and did some rainy site seeing in the meantime. 
   * Moved to Serene Central Hotel, which was a little further away and pricier, but a much more pleasant stay. I figured if I would be stuck indoors I'd want to be comfortable. My only thing is that there was a lot of water leakage during the rain, which the staff asked me to report if it ever happened. I wouldn't be surprised if this is common. 
   * Site seeing in the rain wasn't terrible; I picked up an umbrella and some slides and the area is quite walkable. It was also a lot less busy, and you aren't dealing with a hot sun and humidity. 
   * The afternoon of October 8th, my transfer to Ha Giang was arranged and it generally went smoothly, though communication wasn't great. English competency generally is low and things are a bit chaotic, but they get you to your destination. I caught a transfer car to the bus stop, and then a sleeper bus from Hanoi to Ha Giang, and then a short walk to the hostel, where I arrived around 11pm. 
* October 9-13: Ha Giang loop tour
   * So because my Ninh Binh accommodations were paid for in advance, and I had to be in Ninh Binh for the 14th, I arranged with Lila Inn to [shorten by trip for 7 to 5 days](https://lilainn.tours/tour/ha-giang-loop-cao-bang-5-day/), and rather than loop back to Ha Giang, I would be dropped off in Cao Bang and make my way to Ninh Binh on my own. They were wonderfully flexible and helpful with making changes to my arrangements, and they were one of the most professional companies I interacted with while in Vietnam. 
   * We set off the morning of the 9th and we were a group of 3 solo travellers. The other two women who were with me had booked a 4-day tour, so we travelled as a group for 3 days before they turned back on the 4th and my easy driver and I continued onto Cao Bang separately. 
   * The Loop is incredible. You see people say this a lot online, but photos and videos don't really do it justice. This was a very special experience. More on this below. 
* October 14-16: Ninh Binh
   * I booked my stay with Cháy Mountain Retreat, which was quite nice. 
   * The weather in Ninh Binh was poor, frequent periods of rain, so I didn't get out much since there aren't many indoor activities. I also found the scenery very underwhelming coming off the loop. I would have appreciated it more if I had hit up Ninh Binh first. I was also jarred by the volume of tourists here after returning from the loop. That said, it's considerably less crowded than either Thailand or Japan were, but it felt much more commercial after driving around the countryside. 
* October 17-18: Hanoi, West Lake
   * I opted for a different neighbourhood on my return to Hanoi, so I booked the Minasi Premium Hotel. The hotel was fine; clean. I much preferred this neighbourhood. I do think the Old Quarter is worth staying in for the experience and being close to tourist spots, but it's also still only a 20-30m walk from West Lake, or a short drive. 

**Ha Giang - Cao Bang tour: advice and takeaways**

* Drink lots of water! I noticed our easy riders didn't drink water at meals, and some didn't carry bottles of water with them at all, so it's very easy to get dehydrated. I had a horrible headache at the end of the first day as a result, so make sure you're drinking water throughout the day. 
* Carry cash: especially around Ha Giang province, they have coffee shops at roadside stops all along the route. They sell refreshments and souvenirs, but they may also charge for the toilet. 
* In retrospect, the fact that my tour was cut short was a blessing because it was extremely physically painful for me by the fourth day. The reason for this is that the ride from Dong Van to Bao Lac was a very, very long day, and you're going up and down mountainous terrain for hours, and it put a lot of strain on my body as the passenger. My knees were in a great deal of pain for two days, as well as my lower back (I'm 173cm tall if that helps), just from the strain of keeping myself upright and not sliding onto my easy rider's back. 
* This all made the stops/hikes much more challenging. I'm a reasonably fit person, but the physical pain, rough terrain, high altitude, and humidity made some of these stops miserable. After 4h on a bike with my knees screaming, the last thing I wanted to do was scrambling up a cliffside on craggy rocks. 
* All that said, I am grateful to have seen all of it. Ideally, with this wisdom and more time, I would have preferred to do them separately -- a Ha Giang loop and a Cao Bang loop -- because they have very different landscapes. Cao Bang, once you get there, is very flat and you're riding through valleys with rice fields, and was less busy with tourists (I caught locals sneaking photos of me). I was also lucky to be there when the rice was being harvested. I would definitely recommend both -- it's just the mountain pass that was brutal. 
* Also, the Ban Gioc falls were underwhelming lol I'm glad I went though, but don't let social media drone footage fool you. (Especially if you've seen places like Niagara Falls.)
* I would also recommend a minimum of 4 days for the Ha Giang loop. You could in theory do it in 3, and most people do, but it's nice to have more time to be able to go off the beaten path. Our guides took us to smaller villages and incredible viewpoints where we were the only people there. If you're sticking to the main route as well, you have to suffer the massive party groups that roll up at all the main pit stops. 
* We had good weather for the entire journey, but post-typhoon, especially in Cao Bang, there were remnants of mudslides and flooding. This generally wasn't an issue, but my easy rider and I got stuck at one point for nearly an hour because a van was stuck in the mud and blocked the road on both sides. In Cao Bang City, the flooding had receded and the entire city was still kind of getting things back to working order. I couldn't get Grabs or taxis while I was there, and the city seemed to be at a standstill (understandably). 
* It was also great to have a company make the arrangements. You could probably do this self-guided, but in places where there was less tourism infrastructure, having a guide to navigate things was a help -- if there was a blocked road, he was able to ask locals for directions; the company knew where nice places to stay were; my guide knew where there were good places to eat. Having someone do the driving also meant I could just relax and take in the scenery. 
* Dong Van was also surprisingly cool; I could have spent a couple nights here. 

**Other impressions, observations, and advice**

* Weather can be unpredictable, be flexible!
* English competency is quite low, but people are friendly. I frequently had entire conversations with people using Google translate. 
* Coming from Thailand and Japan, I had expected to find convenience stores all over the place and be able to pick up whatever I needed whenever I wanted -- this was absolutely not the case. I'm not sure about other areas, but in the Old Quarter and West Lake, convenience stores were not common, and they tended to be small, and busy with tourists. I often had to hit up several places to complete my shopping list. Outside of Hanoi, I don't think I saw a single one. Just something to keep in mind. 
* Staff everywhere were very friendly and helpful, but to the point of being obtrusive. I was pressured and even harassed about giving Google reviews constantly, and there was one instance where a staff member took my phone out of my hand to write the review himself. This is annoying, but also keep in mind when reading reviews that they are probably disingenuous and ratings distorted. Everywhere I went, the experience was not as great as I had been led to believe, and at every point -- hotel, tour, grab ride, shop purchase -- I was asked for a review, or offered incentives for leaving one. 
* Depending on your experiences as a tourist, I would recommend lowering expectations in Vietnam. Hotels and resorts aren't going to be as nice as you expect, you're going to encounter squat toilets on the road. Be comfortable with being uncomfortable. 

**Packing list tips**

* Uniqlo packable UV jacket was excellent as a windbreaker for the road. Great for cooler mornings and for bike riding, but also protecting you from sunburn.
* Carry soap and tissue for public toilets; I even wished I can brought one of my Japanese hand towels. 
* Bathing suits ended up being superfluous. I had no access to pools in Hanoi, or it was pouring rain, or it was so hot and humid that I preferred to sit in the AC rather than outside. There are swimming spots on the road in places, but we didn't bother with the hassle of changing in and out.

Here’s something wild: most people on the planet have never invested in a single business. Not their friend’s startup. Not the café they love. Not even ten bucks into a brand they swear by.

And it’s not because they don’t have access.  
Access exists. Apps exist. Minimums are often low. You can literally invest from your phone while waiting in line for coffee.

# So why don’t people do it?

Because the industry has been assuming the problem is *ability*.  
But it’s actually *motivation*.  
People don’t wake up thinking, “I should really diversify into early-stage equity today.” They think about stuff they care about: the gym that feels like home, the craft beer brand they evangelize, the game studio that listens to them.

In other words:  
**Investing still feels disconnected from what matters in real life.**

[](https://medium.com/plans?source=upgrade_membership---post_li_non_moc_upsell--b278b078bf1f---------------------------------------)

Most investment opportunities feel like numbers and charts belonging to someone else’s world. If owning a slice of a business doesn’t feel personal, it’s just homework — and most people will avoid homework forever if given the choice.

# But something interesting is shifting.

Younger generations have grown up with creators and brands they actually feel emotionally tied to. They join Discord servers. They defend brands online like it’s a sport. They crowdfund video games and movie projects and meme coins all because they *care*.

Imagine if all that passion actually turned into ownership.

Not just likes.  
Not just merch.  
Ownership.

The fans who show up early, who give feedback, who tell their friends — they’re already acting like investors. They just aren’t treated like ones.

If that changed?  
If investing felt like becoming part of the story instead of betting on a spreadsheet?

Because the majority of people don’t want to “trade.”  
They want to **belong**.  
They want to support something that feels like *them*.  
They want to say, “I helped build that.”

And maybe — just maybe — that’s the real future of investing.  
Not access.  
Not speculation.  
But **meaning**.

The crowd isn’t waiting for permission.  
They’re waiting for a reason.",1,1764181918.0,DACXI,0,1.0,False

most of downtown connects through the Pedway, so when the weather’s brutal you can move around without going outside. transit is unmatched here: 24 hour CTA rail, the elevated bus platforms including express and jump lines to every edge of the city, Metra at Millennium Station, and Union Station close enough to walk for Amtrak. plus there’s direct access to both airports via the Blue and Orange Lines, so getting to O’Hare or Midway is straightforward any time of day.

Target with a “full” grocery is a block away. Mariano’s (with a better selection of fresh produce etc…) is in Lake Shore East, about three blocks away. Daley Plaza has the big farmers market in spring and summer and the Christmas Market in fall and winter.

the Riverwalk is perfect for dates and totally free. Millennium Park hosts movies and concerts throughout the year. if you walk a bit past the park toward the lake, you can catch the Navy Pier fireworks and hop straight onto the Lakefront Trail.

we have a ton of late night spots like: Petterino’s (and the little Amalfi Coast themed one next door!), The Dearborn, Jimmy’s Gyros, Pizano’s Pizza, Miller’s Pub (Chicago classic), Exchequer, the Pendry hotel lobby bar if you want something polished, Giordano’s, Shake Shack open later than people expect, 7-Eleven’s. for late coffee or food there’s Starbucks, Dunkin, Canes, convenience stores, pharmacies, and Bar Sotto under Italian Village. the best skyline views in my opinion at London House, but Cindys, The Wit, and the Virgin Hotels rooftop are also great rooftops.

Daley Plaza is one of the few places downtown where you can sit outside at night with a lowkey bottle of wine and take in the skyline for free, giving off a European plaza vibe when it’s calm.

the north Loop is surrounded by theaters so there’s always something going on in the evenings, and the AMC dine-in nearby is an easy date setup too. streets get fully decorated every season with lights and installations, and the flower beds, especially the neo-Roman ones along the riverfront, are maintained at a level most neighborhoods don’t come close to.

there’s a local community as well. the Loop Alliance is a non-profit that organizes neighborhood initiatives, seasonal activities (including the occasional themed pub crawl), volunteer programs, and helps keep the area clean and safe. during the day their team in neon green jackets walks around assisting with directions, information, and connecting people with city services. there are close to 100,000 residents living here. it’s a quieter style of community than in other neighborhoods, with people focused during the day and then enjoying the city once they’re off the clock.

downtown offers more than most realize and is still somehow undervalued while everyone battles over the same few zip codes!",104,1764181885.0,chicago,47,0.89,False
1p7fgbs,https://i.redd.it/zn7wwql1an3g1.png,How much coffee do you drink in a day?,"The question is simple: how much caffeine keeps fertility in the clear? Research points to a comfortable lane around 200 mg per day(about two cups),where effects on fertility are unlikely. Risk  increases when refills pile on.

**What the evidence says:**

* ≤200 mg/day (\~2 cups): generally not linked to fertility issues.
* Higher intake can interfere with absorption of nutrients important for reproductive health, like calcium and B vitamins.
* ≥800 mg/day (\~8–10 cups): associated with lower sperm count and reduced motility.

**Drink smarter:**

* Keep coffee to about two cups and don’t forget to count caffeine from tea, energy drinks, soda, and pre-workout beverages.
* Pair coffee with or follow it with protein to help reduce cortisol spikes that may affect hormones.
* Simple add-in: [FullWell Unflavored Collagen Peptides](https://fullwellfertility.com/products/unflavored-collagen-peptides-powder-duo?variant=54477332578377); one scoop blends easily and adds \~14 g protein.",1,1764181782.0,FertilityRealTalk,0,1.0,False

I’m making some new machines and need some help with flavored items. I want the product to inherit the flavor of the input item but whenever I use DROP_IN or DROP_IN_PRESERVE it’s not working how I thought it would? I’ve also tried selphs Extra Machine Configs with no luck and so many combinations of things at this point that I’m just lost. 

Basically I want a machine that makes cheap wine/juice/jelly/pickles/roe fast but the output is either my cheap item but no flavor or it’s vanilla flavored item with a cheap price. I also got it to display my cheap item with flavor using 

ObjectDisplayName: %PRESERVED_DISPLAY_NAME Joja Wine

But the problem is when you combine vanilla and modded items in your bag the prices change to match. They don’t stay as two unique items. Here’s my content.json and the Machines Data starts at line 329 towards the bottom. It’s a problem with both the jar and keg but the non flavored items like beer/caviar/coffee etc all seem to work.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **New Mexico State Aggies vs. Georgia State Panthers: A Beachfront Brawl in Cancun**

The New Mexico State Aggies (5-0) and Georgia State Panthers (1-6) are set to clash in a game that’s less of a contest and more of a math test. Let’s break down why this matchup is as lopsided as a piñata filled with spreadsheets.

**Odds & Stats: The Aggies Are Here to Rebound, Not Romanticize**  
New Mexico State isn’t just winning—they’re *dominating*. The Aggies rank a modest 263rd in scoring (74.2 PPG) but sit a stellar 25th in defense (63.0 PPG allowed), creating a +56 scoring differential that’s about as common as a polite argument between rival bookies. Their rebounding? A beastly 34.4 boards per game, led by Julius Mims, who grabs 8.0 per contest. Imagine Mims as a human mop, vacuuming up missed shots while the Panthers watch, muttering, “We could’ve used that extra coffee.”

Georgia State, meanwhile, is a statistical tragedy. The Panthers shoot a惨淡 34.7% from the field—2.5 points lower than what New Mexico State’s opponents average. Their three-pointers? A desperate game of “Russian roulette” where only 29.7% of shots hit. For context, if you shot as well as GS, you’d make 1-of-3 free throws while blindfolded, juggling, and reciting tax code.

**News Digest: Panthers Struggle to Stay Afloat**  
Georgia State’s recent “victory” over Samford (69-64) was less a triumph and more a mercy mission. Star player Morgan Robinson-Nwagwu dropped 21 points and nine rebounds, but even that effort couldn’t mask the team’s inability to win one-possession games (0-1). It’s like trying to win a race while tied to a parachute—charming in theory, disastrous in practice.

New Mexico State, meanwhile, is riding a five-game winning streak, most recently throttling UC Irvine 57-45. Yes, you read that right—\*45 poin
