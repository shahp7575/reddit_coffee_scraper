My husband 24M I 23F have been married for 2 years. We are very confident and happy in our relationship and don’t have an issue with each other having friends of the opposite sex. So about 6 months ago I met this guy 26M in one of my classes. We hit it off right away and have become good friends. We have hung out lots of times to study and now we will occasionally meet over coffee or take our dogs to the park to catch up since we’re not in class together anymore. We text and send each other funny videos on social media normal platonic friend stuff. He has always been respectful of my marriage and has never given any indications of liking me in more than just a friend kind of way. Well yesterday when we were texting he admitted that he has always thought I am very attractive and that my husband is lucky to have me. It was kind of out of the blue and I immediately told my husband about it. My husband sees nothing wrong with it but I am worried that maybe he is starting to like me more than just a friend. I don’t want to end my friendship with this guy cause we get along really well and I value his friendship. But if he is starting to like me I don’t want to entertain that and inadvertently let him think he has a chance with me when he doesn’t. I was very clear with him when we first started talking that I am married, and that I don’t have any interest in stepping outside of my marriage.

Lulu has suddenly deemed my book in contravention of their agreement and cancelled my order and closed my account. They have not given any specifics of how my project breaks their rules and they are sending me this SIX MONTHS after I first started printing the project with Lulu.

The project is coffee table book comprised of text (written by me) and photos (shot by my coauthor and also licensed from a legit stock photo company.) The book features interviews with famous musicians from the 90s, (conducted by me and written by me.) and many photos.

The notice from Lulu says my book ""may be in violation of the Lulu Membership Agreement which states your project cannot contain material that is intellectual property of another, invasive of privacy rights, defamatory or otherwise questionable and/or determined by us in our sole discretion to violate our Membership Agreement.""

I am guessing they might be objecting to the cover image (which is a famous musician shot in a very stylized out of focus style so there is no recognizable face.) My understanding of the legalities is that COVER art is treated differently than editorial content (photos inside the book itself.) And further that IF I used the likeness of a recognizable famous face on the cover, I would likely be on thin ground legally. However, to restate, my book's cover has no recognizable face on it.

To make matters worse, Lulu has no customer service phone number (unless anyone here has one they can share) and are slow to reply to emails. And worse than that they have cancelled my account and stated that I cannot open a new one.

All this is happening with ZERO info or recourse. Needless to say this is a big problem for me as I have spent almost a year and many thousands of dollars creating this book - and now it has been canceled with no clear reason.

He was telling me im the most perfect person he’d ever met and he likes me so much. i thought “okay he’s going to ask me out” after he called me his girl one night so i said “you never asked me” and we went into a talk about us dating and he was like yeah i was going to wait to ask you but i was so confused because we were already acting like a couple and we obviously liked each other a lot. then he goes onto say we’re dating because we’re not talking to other people but he never officially asked me out so i didn’t know where we stood. days later i think things are going well and he picks me up for a date but once i get in his car i can tell something is very off so i ask him if he’s okay and he starts sobbing about us and how he feels. so immediately i assume im getting dumped and he wants to end things. we pull into a parking lot and he’s telling me he’s just so scared to date anyone right now because he’s not in a good mental state to date plus i go back home for the summer. i ask if he wants to end things and he tells me no, that he wants to be with me but he just can’t date right now so im trying to decipher what the hell that means and he’s just telling me he doesn’t want to let me go and not talk to me anymore. more context he told me this night he’s in love with me and he could see himself marrying me so i’m just confused as hell because how do you tell someone that yet can’t date them. i soon realized he has avoidant attachment personality so im trying to calm him down as he’s sobbing and trying to find compromise telling him ill fly out to see him and we can talk until i get back but we dont have to date. Yet he was making it seem like i was rushing things because i want a relationship but i told him id wait but in his mind i wanted to speed up our dating process until i went back home which wasn’t the truth. We’re still in this parking lot having a talk and im just bewildered because i didnt expect the night to turn into that. We finally calm down and try to go about our night , we still laugh and have a good time with each other despite the pending doom we both felt but didnt want to verbalize. he drops me off at my dorm and i just knew that was my last time seeing him. I text him after our hangout and ask if he needs some time to decide on what he wants and he tells me he doesn’t never wanna talk to me and tells me im the best girl that ever came into his life and he’d rather talk through this then have space. he’s saying he doesn’t ever want to lead me on and he has genuine feelings for me which i believed ( still do to some degree). he says he’s not going anywhere but he’s just scared which valid i understand being scared because im moving back home but he was also bringing up the part where he’s not ready for relationship which i didn’t know what to take from that. we text for a couple days and he invites me to his family’s easter because he didn’t want me to be alone knowing i can’t go home for the holiday, which i thought was a good sign but i tell him i won’t be able to go because i was already going to a friends family’s easter. we continue telling each other we miss each other so much and want to see each other but his car was having problems and he didn’t want to drive it before getting it fixed which i understood. despite things going well for the next couple of days i still felt weird about it and asked again if he wanted to be left alone all though he never gave me any idea he did but i felt weird knowing to some degree he didn’t want to be official with me but we were acting like it was nothing. he again tells me he doesn’t want that at all , he’s just scared that the more we hang the more real and serious we become and that what terrifies him the most because once you have a partner they matter more than you and he’s not in a position to look/care for someone when he can’t even do that for himself. i tell him i understand and i don’t want him to step into anything with me if he’s feeling that way and i can’t beg him to commit to me if that isn’t what he wants. he tells me i’m the only girl in the world he wants and he isn’t unsure about me, he’s just incapable to give me all of him that he feels like a shell of himself. he then again says i want to date as soon as possible and he can’t do that right now yet still wants me in his life. i tell him i never said i wanted a full on relationship right now, i just wanted to know that the more we talk it will hopefully turn into that because i never wanted a situationship. we basically go back and forth we’re he’s telling me he wants to be with me but he just can’t be in a relationship right now and i’m saying that makes no sense and i feel embarrassed that im almost convincing him to be with me one day. we end up talking in circles but both apologize and move on to our usual texting. The next day we’re supposed to see each other and he ask me if i want to stay over which i say yes. I ask him what his eta is to which he tells me he hasn’t left yet because he’s scared to come get me because the more we see each other the more real it gets. at this point im fed up and embarrassed because i want to see him but him saying he doesn’t know if he should come get me makes me realize it’s going to be like this until i go back home so what’s the point in even talking to each other anymore. we end up going back and forth and i end things saying it’s not going to work out. he ends up calling and texting me until the next day which i was avoiding but i answer him because i felt like a cunt for ending it abruptly. we of course end up going back and forth where he’s saying the same thing “you’re perfect, i don’t want to fumble you, it’s you not me , i don’t want to lose you” etc. we end up deciding it is for the best to not further anything and stay friends, we end up deciding to meet up for coffee that week and see each other. I was still left so confused and hurt but i didn’t want to bring it back up because we already decided we weren’t going to be serious. After talking to friends about it and getting their opinions they tell me to cut off all communication and basically telling me everything i know already but was blind to see. that only fuels me more and makes me more angry at him and the situation. he knew from the beginning i was going back home soon so why still continue anything with me? why give me mixed signals and love bomb me when he didn’t want to date me? why call me your girl when you don’t want a girlfriend? why tell me you want to be with me and i’m the only girl you want and i’m the most perfect person ever yet don’t want to commit? , as i’m thinking about it and ranting to my friends about it , i start drafting up a long paragraph to him and sent it. basically saying this is the last time im ever talking to him and im hurt and angry that ive been led on , how his excuses for not wanting to date me make zero sense and i end it by saying to never contact me again. to which he doesn’t. a couple days later i felt like i was so harsh about it and regretted sending it so i sent him an apology to which he didn’t respond. this was almost three weeks ago at this point. I’m still so confused , regretful, angry, sad because despite us not knowing each other for long it was clear we had a strong connection and liked each other so much. i just want him to talk to me again but i realize i probably hurt his feelings with my paragraph and he doesn’t want to ever speak to me again. im going back home in a couple days and i hate knowing im leaving on bad terms with him. we go along so well , and i care about him so much but i can’t reach out to someone who clearly wants nothing to do with me. I just don’t know what to do from here because everyday i just want to reach out to him , i wonder if he misses me, cares about me, regrets this whole thing. that’s the part that sucks the most, just not knowing how he is. I just wanted to rant about this because my friends don’t want to hear about it anymore but i think he was the right person and wrong timing which is devastating. any advice or thoughts??",1,1746590750.0,situationshipsadvice,0,1.0,False

I’d been to Coorg a while back—remembered the stunning landscapes, great coffee, and how distinct the local culture felt. But turns out the people themselves are just as unique as the place.

This new paper breaks down the Coorgs into three genetically distinct groups, despite their shared cultural identity today:

One group is closely related to indigenous South Indian tribes like the Palliyar.

Another has a genetic profile that's basically unmatched in all of South Asia or Eurasia—very isolated and drifted.

A third group is a mix of the two, which might explain the cultural cohesion despite the deep genetic differences.

Also fascinating: the male lineage shows Eurasian and Middle Eastern ancestry, while the maternal line is mostly South Asian—classic pattern of male-led migration meeting local populations.

It’s a super interesting read if you’re into ancient migration, genetics, or hidden histories of Indian communities.

If you’ve ever tried to overhaul your life by sheer willpower (new routine, new diet, new workout, new mindset—all at once), you’ve probably hit a wall.

It’s not that you lack discipline.

It’s that your system has too many moving parts, and not enough anchors.

  
Here’s where habit stacking comes in.



Instead of trying to force a new habit into your day from scratch, you attach it to something you already do.

It’s a psychology-backed method that builds consistency without relying on motivation.

# Try these “Stack This, Not That” ideas:

* Stack This: Stretch for 2 minutes after brushing your teeth
* Not That: Telling yourself you’ll “find time to stretch” at some point today.



* Stack This: Fill a water bottle right before you make your morning coffee

* Not That: Hoping you’ll remember to hydrate in between meetings.



* Stack This: Do 10 bodyweight squats while your shower heats up
* Not That: Committing to a 45-minute workout when you’re exhausted and short on time.



* Stack This: Take a 5-minute walk after every meal
* Not That: Promising yourself you’ll hit 10K steps by the end of the day without a plan.

Why it works:

Your brain loves patterns.

When you stack a new habit onto an existing one, you remove decision fatigue and increase follow-through.



You don’t need to change your whole life—just link better habits to the life you’re already living.

I text him after our hangout and ask if he needs some time to decide on what he wants and he tells me he doesn’t never wanna talk to me and tells me im the best girl that ever came into his life and he’d rather talk through this then have space. he’s saying he doesn’t ever want to lead me on and he has genuine feelings for me which i believed ( still do to some degree). he says he’s not going anywhere but he’s just scared which valid i understand being scared because im moving back home but he was also bringing up the part where he’s not ready for relationship which i didn’t know what to take from that. we text for a couple days and he invites me to his family’s easter because he didn’t want me to be alone knowing i can’t go home for the holiday, which i thought was a good sign but i tell him i won’t be able to go because i was already going to a friends family’s easter. we continue telling each other we miss each other so much and want to see each other but his car was having problems and he didn’t want to drive it before getting it fixed which i understood. despite things going well for the next couple of days i still felt weird about it and asked again if he wanted to be left alone all though he never gave me any idea he did but i felt weird knowing to some degree he didn’t want to be official with me but we were acting like it was nothing. he again tells me he doesn’t want that at all , he’s just scared that the more we hang the more real and serious we become and that what terrifies him the most because once you have a partner they matter more than you and he’s not in a position to look/care for someone when he can’t even do that for himself. i tell him i understand and i don’t want him to step into anything with me if he’s feeling that way and i can’t beg him to commit to me if that isn’t what he wants. he tells me i’m the only girl in the world he wants and he isn’t unsure about me, he’s just incapable to give me all of him that he feels like a shell of himself. he then again says i want to date as soon as possible and he can’t do that right now yet still wants me in his life. i tell him i never said i wanted a full on relationship right now, i just wanted to know that the more we talk it will hopefully turn into that because i never wanted a situationship. we basically go back and forth we’re he’s telling me he wants to be with me but he just can’t be in a relationship right now and i’m saying that makes no sense and i feel embarrassed that im almost convincing him to be with me one day. we end up talking in circles but both apologize and move on to our usual texting. The next day we’re supposed to see each other and he ask me if i want to stay over which i say yes. I ask him what his eta is to which he tells me he hasn’t left yet because he’s scared to come get me because the more we see each other the more real it gets. at this point im fed up and embarrassed because i want to see him but him saying he doesn’t know if he should come get me makes me realize it’s going to be like this until i go back home so what’s the point in even talking to each other anymore. we end up going back and forth and i end things saying it’s not going to work out. he ends up calling and texting me until the next day which i was avoiding but i answer him because i felt like a cunt for ending it abruptly. we of course end up going back and forth where he’s saying the same thing “you’re perfect, i don’t want to fumble you, it’s you not me , i don’t want to lose you” etc. we end up deciding it is for the best to not further anything and stay friends, we end up deciding to meet up for coffee that week and see each other. I was still left so confused and hurt but i didn’t want to bring it back up because we already decided we weren’t going to be serious. After talking to friends about it and getting their opinions they tell me to cut off all communication and basically telling me everything i know already but was blind to see. that only fuels me more and makes me more angry at him and the situation. he knew from the beginning i was going back home soon so why still continue anything with me? why give me mixed signals and love bomb me when he didn’t want to date me? why call me your girl when you don’t want a girlfriend? why tell me you want to be with me and i’m the only girl you want and i’m the most perfect person ever yet don’t want to commit? , as i’m thinking about it and ranting to my friends about it , i start drafting up a long paragraph to him and sent it. basically saying this is the last time im ever talking to him and im hurt and angry that ive been led on , how his excuses for not wanting to date me make zero sense and i end it by saying to never contact me again. to which he doesn’t. a couple days later i felt like i was so harsh about it and regretted sending it so i sent him an apology to which he didn’t respond. this was almost three weeks ago at this point. I’m still so confused , regretful, angry, sad because despite us not knowing each other for long it was clear we had a strong connection and liked each other so much. i just want him to talk to me again but i realize i probably hurt his feelings with my paragraph and he doesn’t want to ever speak to me again. im going back home in a couple days and i hate knowing im leaving on bad terms with him. we go along so well , and i care about him so much but i can’t reach out to someone who clearly wants nothing to do with me. I just don’t know what to do from here because everyday i just want to reach out to him , i wonder if he misses me, cares about me, regrets this whole thing. that’s the part that sucks the most, just not knowing how he is. I just wanted to rant about this because my friends don’t want to hear about it anymore but i think he was the right person and wrong timing which is devastating. any advice or thoughts??",1,1746590536.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

1- i go to the mall with a familiar girl, we sit and enjoy a good meal, the thing is, from nowhere, a homeless man starts harassing my friend, so i decide to beat the shit out of this poor fella, but i ended up killing him with no remorse 

2- i quietly leave the mall to go home, but my car got stolen with no traces, it felt weird somehow 

3- a friendly neighbor realized what just happend and invited me to his house to have some coffee i guess, while waiting in the living room with some other random guy, the neighbor daughter invites me to his bedroom, i accept, the weird thing is that his bedroom is like below the house, and is not a pleasant thing (the girl was good looking tho), when we get to the bed she tells me ""you don't need protection, my boyfriend will not know, and i believe im already pregnant""

My wife recently accepted a new position that will have her working near Millennium Park, right in the heart of downtown Chicago. She’ll be commuting into the office three days a week, so we’re trying to figure out what’s *too far* in terms of a realistic drive or train ride. That said, she used to commute an hour each way in D.C. traffic, so we’re not afraid of a longer ride — as long as it’s reliable and reasonably smooth. I’m retired military, so I won’t need to worry about a daily commute — at least not until I eventually find the right job — which gives us a bit more flexibility when it comes to choosing a location.

Her company has generously given her nine months to relocate, which gives us some breathing room — but with two kids and the upcoming school year on the horizon, we’re hoping to make the move this summer. Our goal is to be settled into a new neighborhood before school starts in the fall, especially since our oldest will be starting 8th grade.

So far, the research has been both exciting and — let’s be honest — a little overwhelming. The Chicago suburbs are full of amazing towns, each with its own character, vibe, and strengths. It’s a great problem to have, but narrowing down the options has become a bit of a part-time job.

Here’s what we’re looking for in our next hometown:

* Single-family homes with a yard
* Strong public schools
* Youth sports programs — especially baseball and basketball
* Walkable neighborhoods where the kids can walk to school, and we can walk to downtown, parks, or grab a coffee
* A vibrant local scene with good restaurants, bars, summer festivals, and a strong sense of community

Our son is all about sports — he lives for baseball and basketball — so we’ve been paying close attention to school programs, park districts, and local leagues. We’ve also come to appreciate walkability more and more. After years just outside D.C., we value being in a place where you can walk to the library, pick up dinner, or head to the park without always jumping in the car.

We’ve never been to Chicago before, so this Memorial Day weekend, we’re flying out to explore. We’re planning to visit towns like St. Charles, Riverside, Elmhurst, Downers Grove, Glen Ellyn, and La Grange. These spots keep popping up in our research for their strong schools, charming downtowns, and family-friendly reputations. We’re also curious about Oak Park, especially for its proximity to the city and historic, artsy vibe.

But we’re keeping an open mind. We want to walk the neighborhoods, peek into the parks, grab a few meals, and just get a feel for each town’s personality. Sometimes a place just clicks when you’re there in person.

If you live in the Chicago suburbs — or know someone who does — we’d love your recommendations! Where do your kids play ball? Where’s the best pizza? What towns throw the best summer festivals?

We’re excited for this next chapter and looking forward to finding a new place to call home — one deep dish at a time.

As discussed yesterday, Marvel Edge comes and goes in the time it takes to make a cup of coffee, but an even worse idea was on its way…the costume redesign.

I don’t know who thought that GR should go from the traditional black leather to some kind of Day Glo abomination, but I hope they never worked in comics again (they were probably promoted).

Luckily, this doesn’t last too long either, almost exactly one year, but this eyeball scorching costume was indicative of the title as a whole at this point, just plain bad.

1kgoa6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kgoa6s/aio_for_the_way_my_friend_ended_our_friendship/,AIO for the way my friend ended our friendship?,"I (30 F) had been following this woman on tiktok for awhile. We fast became online friends. After a little while, she asked me if I wanted to go get lunch with her in person. I said yes, and we became real friends.

We had a lot of fun together, I met her girlfriend, and her best friend. I made fast friends with her best friend as well and the three of us would have sleepovers, talk, smoke weed, do crafts and play some games. Sometimes we went out for brunch. At this point, we have been friends in person for about a year.

Last weekend, we had one of our sleepovers, the first one in a long time, because all of us had been going through something. One friend lost her job, and two people close to her, and the other broke free from a horrible relationship. Me, I lost my 19 year old cat on NYE, had my other cat need surgery, broke my ribs, and also had been dealing with extreme back pain, that makes it to where I can't even turn over in bed, let alone stand, or walk. I ended up in the E.R for it, it was so bad. I am also very financially stressed, and emotionally healing from my own abusive relationship.

Now, the hangout was fun and totally normal, however, prior to showing up, I hadn't slept for about 48 hours, so after being up all day with them, I crashed hard that night. The next morning I was woken up, because the two girls wanted to go shopping in a couple of hours and they wanted me to head home by then. I kind of wondered why I wasn't invited, but I thought to myself that just because we're all friends, doesn't mean I get an automatic invite to everything. They were friends first, and they are allowed to hang out without me. I also figured they knew I was super tired. I didn't think much about it.

We were sitting around having coffee and waking up together just chatting about life, and I suddenly just felt really overwhelmed by mine. I just started to cry out of nowhere. I felt so embarrassed because I don't like being vulnerable in front of other people. I just couldn't stop myself. I'm sure it was from prolonged stressed, tiredness, feeling like I was in a safe space.... 

I apologized so many times as I tried to stop crying, the girls reassured me it was okay to cry, and to talk it through. They started giving me advice, instead of just an ear to listen, and because I was in such a panicked. When they would suggest something I didn't really take it in, in the moment. I tend to process things later. It takes me stepping away and thinking about it in a clearer headspace to really have it sink in.

When I went home, alot of the advice they had given me, I thought about, and I actually took some of it. I did some things I've needed to for a long while. While not all of it was obtainable, some of it gave me ideas for other ways of achieving the goals to get to a place where I'm less stressed, and more independent, like I want.

So, in my mind, I'm thinking, wow, what an amazing weekend. That was so fun, and they were so kind and understanding despite me being so vulnerable and scared of judgement. I came away from it thinking we were closer than ever, and that they understood where I was coming from.

Wrong. A week later, I get a message from one of the friends saying she didn't think she was in a place to keep growing our friendship. Obviously I was shocked, and I didn't know what to say. I ended up just saying how much I enjoyed getting to know her, and that I'd respect her choice.

I felt like I had been stabbed in the gut, she didn't give any reasoning to say that it was me as the issue, but I just knew it was my mini breakdown. Her message felt like a cop-out to me, like 'it's not you, it's me'. 

I ended up messaging the other friend, to let her know what had happened, since I've primarily only gotten to hang with her, when she's with the other friend. I ended up asking what at happened, because it turns out, she felt the same as the other friend. Well, apparently they just saw me making excuses for why I couldn't do things, while they were trying to help me. She in particular felt like I had just slapped her in the face by not taking any of her advice on board.

I ended up explaining to her that I was not thinking at all clearly at the time, and that I was making excuses out of fear and prolonged stress and tiredness. I have bipolar disorder, and sometimes I have a small breakdown, where I kind of wind myself up, before calming myself down, clearing my headspace and actually doing something about it. I told her all the ways in which I took her advice since our hangout, and she told me she was sorry she judged me so harshly, and that she was triggered by past trauma, which I understand all too well. She thought it had all fallen of deaf ears.

I wish I had managed to explain everything, clear it up before going home and leaving a  negative impression.

I managed to make things right with friend B, but she says friend A had something else bad happen, and to wait a little while before trying to fix it with her.

However, something isn't sitting right with me. How quickly I was thrown aside. No attempt to communicate with me first. The way they reassured me it was okay to cry, but then judged me so fast. I kind of feel like it's their way or the highway now, like I don't dare not take their advice, in fear of being cast aside again. I guess some of my trust for them is broken now, and that really sucks.

1kgo8kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kgo8kz/recently_diagnosed_with_isbd_on_meds_that_work_80/,Recently diagnosed with ISB-D. On meds that work 80% of the time but feel like I’m losing in life,"(Please forgive spelling/grammatical errors, I am dyslexic and sometimes rereading posts doesn’t get all the errors corrected) 

For background I am 23M and was diagnosed with ISB-D last year, but have been living with the symptoms for the last two years. My entire life before the symptoms started I had an “iron gut.” I could eat or drink  anything, go anywhere, travel, the whole nine yards. I would always have two bowel movements a day, one after lunch and one after dinner. They were always solid and I rarely had any bowel issues. I will say that there were still foods that upset my gut (coffee, rich foods, lots of carbs) but other than that I was fine. I should also add that I would get the “D.A.D.S” (Day After Drinking Sh*ts) the morning after a long night of drinking. However, it would usually be a soft stool or two in the morning, then I would be fine the rest of the day. I was a heavy drinker in college but I’ve slowed way down since graduating. I also am a nicotine user (zyns) but quit for 6 months while experimenting with diet to see if that was a cause, it didn’t seem to change anything weather I was using nicotine or not. 

My IBS symptoms started two years ago, as mentioned, where I was woken up from a deep sleep with the worst stomach pain imaginable. I thought maybe I had to have a bowel movement or possibly vomit. I couldn’t do either. While attempting to crawl to my roomates bedroom door to have him drive me to the hospital, the pain subsided enough for me to stand/walk. I decided that was good enough for me and went back to bed. An hour or so later, the same scenario occurred. Again the pain subsided enough for me to go back to sleep and so I did. The following day was hell. I felt like I was going to crap my pants or throw up all day. I ended up suffering through work and immediately went home after I clocked out to go straight to bed. 

In the following days I had lots of diarrhea; thinking it was from this “stomach bug” I had gotten, I paid little attention to it. After a week of this, I decided that maybe I needed some probiotics to “rebalance” everything after this ordeal and then I would be good as new. That lasted for about a week (a week of being back to normal, to be precise). Then I started feeling like I had to go to the bathroom ALL THE TIME, even if I couldn’t. As soon as I would get ready for work and head out the door I would get that feeling that I needed to go. I would go back inside and sit on the toilet with no luck. Drive to work and sit on the toilet there, nothing. The feeling only subsided after I had a bowel movement, but it was a 50/50 shot if I actually had to go or not throughout the day. Even when I did go, my stool would be light and fluffy (for lack of better terms). 

I thought that maybe the probiotics were “doing too much” so I stopped taking them. That feeling of constantly having to go to the bathroom went away. BACK TO NORMAL, for about a week. My symptoms then changed. Now instead of always feeling like I had to go, I would be fine one moment, then sprinting to the closest toilet the next. It didn’t matter what I was doing; I could be sitting on the couch, driving, going for a walk, or at the gym when all of a sudden I would get extreme urgency to go. Again, it was mainly diarrhea or those light fluffy stool mentioned previously.

The symptoms then began to start getting “better” (not as bad) where I could, once in a blue moon, have semisolid/solid stools. However, I would still get flareups most everyday. Sometimes I would have a completely solid stool and minutes later be right back on the toilet with diarrhea. I literally could not trust my gut no matter what false hope it gave me. 

This absolutely TANKED my social life. I was afraid of going out and possibly having an accident in my pants as a grown man. I sadly started to have a very poor relationship with food. I thought if I didn’t eat, I wouldn’t have to go to the bathroom. This led to me loosing 27 pounds. I’ve always had a high metabolism and it was so hard to put on weight. I worked very hard to gain weight and I lost it in a matter of a month or so. I then decided to go to a GI. They did a stool sample and some blood work. I was also tested for celiac and lactose intolerance. Everything came back negative. 

I managed my symptoms the best I could for about a year after that. Tried low FODMAP diets, cut out gluten, cut out lactose, used different pro/prebiotics, and even stopped drinking alcohol for a while. Nothing seemed to work. Every new thing I tried would subdue the flares and I would be back to normal (before IBS) for a week or so, then it was right back to being fine one moment and extreme urgency the next. I will note that I’ve always been very active. I played sports in high school and was a competitive weightlifter in college. So I was getting plenty of exercise before and during this time. Funny enough, I would wake up early, drink 32oz of water, walk around my apartment, stretch, and that would “get the juices flowing” enough for me to need to use the restroom. After that it was hit or miss if I needed to go again before the evening. I would eventually go again in the evening, like stated before, and was usually okay after that. Still not living, but alive. 

I decided to go to a different GI. I got more bloodwork done, another stool sample, they tested me for SIBO, and got a colonoscopy. Everything was “good to go” on paper. I was completely healthy. So, like any good doctor whose patient seems to have bowel issues with no definitive cause, they chalked it up to IBS-D. Awesome! My GI gave me peppermint extract pills (IBGard) and told me to take two in the morning and two at night. I’ve been on them for the last year. They work pretty well but I still get flareups. Usually I will flare up in stressful situations (I don’t like airports, planes, or crowds) but other times I could be on the couch, relaxing, when all of a sudden I will slowly start to feel like crap and end up having to go to the bathroom with, you guessed it, diarrhea; for seemingly no reason at all. For this reason, I said no to any anti anxiety meds given it didn’t seem to be solely tied to stress/anxiety. 
 
Recently, I’ve realized I’ve just been going along with my symptoms and now I want to pursue more potential cures (even though IBS is incurable). At least something that gets me back to 90-95% normal. I’ve seen some people say they did a parasite cleanse which “cured” them of their IBS. I’m honestly thinking of trying this just to see if it helps. I’ve got no reason to believe I have a parasite but I do live around two major rivers (which I am constantly swimming in), eat wild game (always cooked well and never close to be considered dangerous), and around pets/livestock. 

If anyone has similar symptoms and has done things I haven’t mentioned with better luck, please let me know! 

I am also more than happy to elaborate on anything posted above if you have questions.

**Background**

I'm late 20s woman who has had an on-and-off relationship with fitness.

I played sports all throughout childhood and high school, spent a couple years in college being really into powerlifting, and then was mostly sedentary with brief spurts of physical activity here and there until last year.

Initially for weight loss reasons, I decided to TRY to pick up running (for the umpteenth time)...but this time, it stook for some reason. Historically, I've hated running and never understood how people could do it. Turns out it was because I was focused on running too fast instead of going at a pace where I could relax.

Went from being able to barely run a mile to running 10K distances in a few months.

At the beginning of this year, I decided I wanted to put my mind towards training for a half-marathon, as I am able to be most consistent with my fitness when there is a goal attached to it.

**Training**

Used the Hal Higdeon's Half Marathon training plan for beginners. But would fudge some of the training days, so averaged out to be moreseo 3-4 days/week training rather than 4-5 days/week. But, I like to count my weekly competitive volleyball games as cross training haha.

Hal Higdeon's plan stops with your final run being 10 miles...I was a little nervous about being able to go the extra 3.1 miles

**Pre-race**

I had a 2.5 week ""vacation"" that made it very difficult to fit in running a week before the race. I got only 2 runs in over the course of 3 weeks, and was feeling very nervous about my capabilities.

Fortunately, I did an easy 5k a few days before the race and surprisingly didn't lose too much fitness.

That being said, I was only able to get 2 hours of sleep before the race due to alarm clock anxiety...I was definitely stacking the odds against me lol.

**Race**

Woke up at 6:30am after 2 hours of sleep, made myself some coffee (I had already eaten a slice of pizza at 3am, so didn't feel like eating breakfast), got dressed, packed my mid-run snacks, and made my way over to the race.

I naturally started the race at a slightly sped-up pace due to wanting to ""keep up with the pack"", but slowed down by mile 2 at a comfortable pace once I realized what I was doing. I would have ""rabbits"" that I'd stay behind as a marker of keeping my pace consistent. For every couple of miles, I'd naturally pick up my pace, overtake my ""rabbit"" and find a new rabbit to set a comfortable pace at again. This wasn't intentional, was just listening to my body on when I could push through. I also made sure to nibble on my snacks at the 4 mile and 8 mile points.

By the time that I was 3 miles away from finishing, I was with a completely new pack of people that I didn't recognize. 

Once I saw that I only had 3 miles to go, I hyped myself up and kept going. Once I was 1 mile out, I decided to switch from podcasts to my running playlist as further motivation to pick up pace and finish strong.

Finished at 2 hours and 20 minutes and was completely gassed out. 

**Post-race**

I was a zombie until I got a banana, a nutrition bar, and water into me. One fellow runner who was in my final pack congratulated me. I passed by another girl in my final pack and congratulated her on finishing as well.

My boyfriend waited for me at the finish line and was super supportive. It was a great accomplishment.

What did I learn? 

That despite putting several obstables in front of me (low sleep, a vacation before the race), I was still able to push through and be successful. Maybe this will mean by body will let me sleep for my next race haha.

I also learned that I like the adrenaline of a race day. I loved listening to my body on when I could push or when I should slow down. Perhaps I'm not doing it right and I should be at a consistent pace the entire race, but it felt nice being able to successfully overtake people and not burn myself out.

I definitely want to do anothe race. I love the positive, supportive energy of a race. Seeing people give each other high fives as someone faster than them passes by on the return loop, the people cheering you on from the sides. 

You're racing against others, sure. But you're really racing WITH others while trying to push against yourself.

1kgo812,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1kgo812/good_advice_to_be_happy/,good advice to be happy,"Happiness isn’t just luck—it’s a habit. While we can’t control everything that happens to us, we can control how we respond. True happiness comes from daily decisions that shape our mindset, relationships, and perspective.



In this article, you’ll discover practical, powerful advice to cultivate joy—no matter your circumstances.

https://preview.redd.it/ksssbmbg9aze1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f0643ab33c9eee50630233b82f4fe68b083eea1



1. Focus on What You Can Control



Worrying about things beyond your control drains happiness. Instead, direct your energy toward actions that improve your life:



\- Your attitude – Choose optimism.

\- Your effort – Work on solutions, not complaints.

\- Your time – Spend it with people who uplift you.



→Try this: Write down three things you’re grateful for every morning. Gratitude shifts focus from lack to abundance.



2. Let Go of Perfection



Happiness thrives in progress, not perfection.



\- Mistakes? They’re lessons.

\- Flaws? They make you unique.

\- Unfinished goals? Keep going—success is a journey.



Example: A musician doesn’t master the piano in one day. Joy comes from loving the practice, not just the performance.



3. Prioritize People Who Matter



Quality relationships fuel happiness.



\- Surround yourself with those who inspire, support, and celebrate you.

\- Limit time with negative influences.

\- Be the friend you’d want to have—kindness is contagious.



Science says: Strong social connections increase life satisfaction more than wealth or fame (Harvard Study).



4. Move Your Body, Boost Your Mood



Exercise isn’t just for fitness—it’s for happiness.



\- Walking, dancing, or yoga releases endorphins (natural mood lifters).

\- Even 10 minutes a day helps reduce stress and anxiety.



Tip: Pair movement with joy—listen to upbeat music or walk in nature.



5. Help Others, Help Yourself



Generosity creates happiness.



\- Small acts matter: A smile, a compliment, or volunteering.

\- Giving shifts focus from ""What’s wrong with my life?"" to ""How can I make life better for others?""



→Challenge: Do one kind thing daily—it’s a win-win for you and the world.



6. Limit Comparisons



Comparing yourself to others steals joy.



\- Social media isn’t reality—people post highlights, not struggles.

\- Run your own race: Your path is unique.



Mantra: ""I am enough. My journey is mine alone.""



7. Embrace Simple Pleasures



Happiness hides in everyday moments.



\- Savor coffee, laughter, or a sunset.

\- Unplug regularly—joy often grows in stillness.



Exercise: Spend 5 minutes daily doing nothing but breathing and noticing the good around you.



8. Forgive—Not for Them, but for You



Holding onto resentment hurts you most.



\- Forgiveness frees your heart to feel peace.

\- It doesn’t mean excusing bad behavior—just releasing its grip on you.



Tip: Write a letter (you don’t send) to release pent-up emotions.



9. Learn to Say ""No""



Protecting your peace is self-care.



\- Say yes to what aligns with your values.

\- Say no to what drains you—guilt-free.



Reminder: You can’t pour from an empty cup.



10. Believe in ""Yet""



Replace ""I’m not happy"" with ""I’m not happy… yet.""



\- Happiness grows with patience and action.

\- Every day is a new chance to choose joy.



Happiness Is Built Daily



You don’t need a perfect life to be happy—just purposeful choices. Start small:



1. Control the controllable.

2. Celebrate progress.

3. Connect deeply.

4. Give freely.



Happiness isn’t a destination—it’s the way you travel. Today, choose one piece of advice and act on it. The more you practice, the brighter life becomes.

(Theory)","Since discovering my abdominal issues all this time have been caused by my gallbladder I've been doing heavy research both about the gallbladder and my past actions, diet, etc.

For context I'm F24 and 130 lbs.

This is not the first time I've dealt with these ""gallbladder attacks"" and funny enough I went through the same phases everytime this has happened to me and now it all makes sense!

Everytime I've gone through a period of gallbladder attacks it was preceeded by me eating less (fasting unintentionally), losing weight, being regularly dehydrated and living sedentary. A perfect recipe for gallbladder dysfunction. Especially considering I consume a fairly large amount of fat in my diet so going from high fat to no fat just makes it that much more of a risk. Basically going from high bile buildup, to bile stagnation.

A couple of the staples in my diet during times of no abdominal issues happens to be coffee and chocolate along with being more physically active and eating regularly.

All that said, I have a theory that coffee and dark chocolate could potentially resolve bile stagnation or ""clear"" bile sludge. NOT overnight**‼️ but rather gently overtime. It is crucial NOT to try to do an immediate clear of your gallbladder because if you have stones forcing the gallbladder to contract could push a stone into the biliary duct and cause blockage leaving you in a world of pain my friend and risk needing surgery.

My dr claimed to see sludge on an ultrasound.

My goal is to drink at least 1 cup of coffee per day and eat 1/2 of a square of 70% dark chocolate along with a low-fat, high fiber diet. I intend to slowly increase the chocolate intake overtime so long as my symptoms allow it. I'm on day 3 so far. Will post an update.

Coffee:  Can gently stimulate the gallbladder and increase bile production. Several studies show that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of gallstones, possibly by keeping bile circulating regularly.
Dark chocolate (cocoa polyphenols & Magnesium):   can support smooth muscle relaxation, may have anti-inflammatory effects and can support liver and bile health. Dark Chocolate is high in fat which can cause stronger contractions, this is why I'm starting small and going slow with it.

‼️ If you decide to try this as well the critical thing is to start slowly and continue only if you body allows. And of course discuss with your Dr first because everyone's body is different and what works for one may not work for another. Especially if you have confirmed stones, please discuss this with your doc first 🙏 I am only attempting this because there were not any confirmed stones. Listen to your body. I also wouldn't start if you're currently inflamed or healing from an attack. Calm your system first, I did the BRAT diet with white rice instead of toast and added chicken for protein for a couple days to calm my system beforehand. ‼️",1,1746589604.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

She's a Chinese Filipina, from a family of business owners and politicians (they sling around more money than I've ever seen, and I am mentioning this for a reason), while I come from a lower-middle class family of factory workers (again, this is pertinent). We live together in America, we have our own house with just my name on the mortgage, a mess of little dogs, no children.

She has been unemployed for 5 years, and is a SAHW because ""a 9-5 just isn't her"", as she says. I have supported her with no issues in that itself, but she also spends money so casually under the... pretense of starting a business, which she is trying to do for the fourth time since we've been together. One failed, one was abandoned at the first sign of hardship, and the other one has made less than $5k
in three years, but cost us around $20,000 to maintain. By ""us"", I mean me on a union labor job and whoever she borrows money from. The mortgage is constantly in a state of defaulting or close to it, our bills are always late on the verge of suspension of service, and I'm working my butt off to keep us afloat.

Any time I address our need to not spend money, it is not only being met with her preaching the gospel of ""always keep money moving"", but the rare times I finally get the nerve to tell her *respectfully* we're totally financially screwed because of her spending, she threatens to divorce me, or maybe find a good husband that will let her go to the spa or whatever, and that pretty much nukes the conversation. If I go to bed before I cave in and do damage control, she will stomp and slam things around to deprive me of sleep, break dishes and stuff (we have 2 coffee mugs left) and won't cook, clean, eat, or bathe until I give into whatever sparked the argument.

If we divorce, I'm still financially liable to support her for 3 more years as she's on a marriage visa (I'm not a passport bro, and she wasn't some 90 day fiancé, it was a very naturally-forming relationship). I do love her so much, but she treats me so coldly when we fight like this and it's almost always about money.

This guy, we'll call him S, has done it all four years, but this is the first year I've seen him. We become friends over Hatsune Miku, and exchange numbers. We talk often over the two weeks he's here. This next part is the part I'm most confused about because I can't read social cues to save my life. He sends texts saying things like ""I wish I could be with you more, I'll miss you"" and stuff. that's sweet but ultimately not too telling of anything right? ""Whenever you come to Japan, tell me and I'll come visit you."" ""I think I'll stay up late just to talk with you haha"" huh, okay. making me kick my feet and giggle a little bit here, guy. We started talking about fruits. He says he doesn't like them, I say my favorites are strawberries. He says theyre too sweet for him and then sends some cute strawberry emoji. I said it was cute, so he responded with a text in Japanese saying ""いちご好きな君もかわいい"" or ""you who likes strawberries is also cute."" WOAH. okay. The conversation continues on, and he ends up asking me to go to Starbucks with him after school on the last day he's here. I agree, we set up a plan. Our friend third-wheels because he's worse at reading social cues than me. Throughout the day, he tells me how excited he is to go with me, and about how he'll miss me when he goes back. He also said ""I want to stay here, or take you back to Japan with me. I want to take you to popular tourist sightseeing places."" One day he was playing pickleball and texted saying he would rather be spending time with me than playing. Either I'm cool, or he hates pickleball. Well, we go to Starbucks after school, and we get our drinks. He ordered some coffee and I got a pink drink, he paid. we sat down and just talked and had fun. He told me about how he likes cars and designing(?) them or customizing them or something, and had me customize parts on a car on a website. We peeled the stickers off our drinks and put them on our phone cases to remember each other (his idea). Right before we left, I gave him a note I wrote in (very poor) Japanese saying I had fun and basically telling him I liked him, and I went straight home. His response was ""I'm happy, but it will be hard to date."" and rejected me, but I don't like that word. He was sweet about it. But I'm even more confused after this. He says he wishes I was his host family so we could spend more time together. The next day I send pictures of me playing D&D with friends, and he says he wishes he could be there and that he wants to play it with me. I promised to teach him how to play someday. He leaves to go to the airport, and says he's sad and he misses me. And that he'll text whenever he comes back. He says he likes talking to me rather than studying because studying is more boring. He says he thought I initially hated him when we first met because I was very shy and quiet... oops. I thought he was cute from the beginning and was terrified to mess it up or that he'd think I was annoying. Kinda funny now actually. He still knows I like him, he doesn't seem to mind at all. His main response was that he wasnt used to being so liked by someone. then he said ""僕を惚れさせれるものなら惚れさせてみな"" or ""if you can make me fall in love, then try"". then when i ask what he really meant by this, he says it was a joke? But he didnt say anything about it being a joke initially.  we call each other grandma and grandpa as a joke. we were both hungry once late at night and he said ""do you want me to make something?😉"" boarding starts on the plane and he says he wishes I was there with him. We talk about me visiting Japan someday and he says ""where will you stay? my house? 🤭"" and I say yes, if he'll let me. He says thay if his parents agree then he would want to. he sends some flirty texts now and then, like ""you'll have to get used to ___ if you want to live with me! 🤭 just kiddinggg"" or ""i don't wanna go to sleepppp, i wanna talk to you 🤭"" he uses that emoji often. I got confused because like... I like him too. does he like me? is he jusy actualky joking? am i insane? so i try to ask him if all this is a joke or if he likes me/is trying to flirt. then he says, word for word, ""Sorry I’m not your boyfriend or something like that so I can’t really answer that"" what does that mean?? if anyone could just.. offer insight. one of my friends thinks he backed himself into a corner and is panicking and never really meant anything. most people think he has/is developing feelings but is skeptical because of long distance (14 hr time difference). I think that's probably the case? i'm not trying to expect a whole lot because I fall for people pretty hard and fast and that's not everyone's style. but if anyone could let me know if I'm insane or not for thinking be might be flirting then it'd be greatly appreciated! this was not sparknotes i'm so sorry for the wall of text.",1,1746589504.0,teenrelationships,1,1.0,False

The pattern usually looks like this:

* Set a huge, inspiring goal (lose 30 pounds, work out 6x a week, cut out sugar, etc.)
* Get overwhelmed by how far it feels from where you are now
* Try to do everything perfectly
* Miss a few steps, feel like you failed
* Stop completely—because if you can’t do it “right,” what’s the point?

Here’s the thing: your expectations might be sabotaging your progress.

They’re not bad because they’re ambitious—they’re unhelpful because they don’t match your current bandwidth, lifestyle, or energy.



So how do we flip that?



# 1. Start with your real life, not your “ideal” life.

Be honest about what you have the capacity for this week, not what your ideal self could handle with no distractions or stress.



# 2. Pick one needle-moving habit.

This could be walking 10 mins after lunch, drinking a full water bottle before coffee, or committing to 2 workouts instead of 6.

Make it so easy it’s almost impossible to fail.



# 3. Set boundaries with your inner perfectionist.

If that voice tells you it’s “not enough,” remind yourself: consistency beats intensity every time.

The goal isn’t to prove your worth—it’s to build something sustainable.

  
4. Redefine success as alignment.

Not willpower. Not restriction. Not hustle.

But showing up in a way that honors your values, your body, and your life.



You don’t need to lower the bar—you need to set the bar where it belongs for you right now.

That’s not laziness. That’s strategy.

That’s growth.

I’m probably bisexual, but eh, if it doesn’t ever work out with a guy it’s not worth it to announce that.

Anyways, I got a new job recently, and there’s this one guy (M<30 probably) at work that I find really attractive, and I’ve been trying to gauge his level of interest in me. 

Some things to note:

1. He doesn’t really engage at all on social media, but he’s super active with posting. I will send him something and he’ll like it or he might send one message. It doesn’t really seem like he wants to talk at all outside of that so I don’t push it.

2. I don’t know his relationship status. He has no posts of anyone on his socials other than himself. He is tagged in a few photos and videos with this girl, but those posts are from December, and there’s no like “anniversary” posts or anything. He certainly doesn’t talk about dating at all.

3. He goes out of his way to fist bump me like a lot. Everybody else does that at this job, but he does it to me like a lot.

4. I’m pretty fem

His attitude towards me seems to either be really talkative and smiley, or kind of distant. He could just be more tired those days though, and it has zero to do with me.

Two things that he’s said in particular stuck out to me the past week:

- I put the brush for the coffee grinder in the wrong spot when we were closing up the previous night, and he came up to me asking if I knew where it was. What stood out to me was when he said “oh it’s honestly just a minor inconvenience, in fact it’s nicer to see you than it is an inconvenience” or whatever the hell, something like that. 

- I hadn’t talked to him at all a day later and I spotted him on my way to my lunch, so I asked him how he was doing. He said his head really hurt, and I was like “awww I’m so sorry!! That’s the worst, I have some Tylenol if you want” he declined but said “It’s nice to know you care about how I’m doing” and I honestly didn’t know how to respond to that bc the way he said it really made me question what exactly he meant. The tone was odd. Idk how to explain it. I was just like “of course I care! Let me know if you change your mind”

Also this was probably like two weeks ago but I think he responded to a message I sent him but then deleted it? Like I saw the notification at 8am briefly, and then I checked again at 11 am to respond to it and it was gone. I think he was drunk when he sent it tho, something about “big ballin at a club” gahahha. 

Anyways, I can’t tell if he reciprocates some attraction, and for some reason is shy, or if I’m just giving him attention he likes? Or maybe he has zero thoughts towards me and I just really don’t get it 😂😂😂 I think i just don’t even know how to read men to be honest, if anyone that has dated men or is a man can give me some advice pls help hahah thanks

1kgnwrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kgnwrv/title_need_advice_after_my_bf_m22_got_upset_i_f22/,Title: Need advice after my BF (M22) got upset I (F22) went to an alternative pop/rnb concert and posted it on Instagram,"
Hi, this is my first time posting on here, and I’m not used to Reddit at all, but I have no idea where else to get unhinged advice. So basically, me and my bf (both 22, final-year uni students) had this huge fight over the past few days cos I went to a concert with my friend (which I paid for myself. 
He wasn’t happy about it, and it’s turned into this whole thing about values and religion. And like I do love him, he has amazing qualities, but recently his behaviour and this reaction to me going to the concert it feels like the final straw and I am so confused if I did anything wrong. 


So for context, we’ve been dating for 2 and a half years, and we’re both Indian Christian and first 1st gen, like we basically grew up in the same city, and now we’re both finishing off our degree. And currently, everything has been a bit stressful with final year exams and his mom broke her ankle, so he’s been looking after her, and I’ve got my final assignments and exams coming up. And, we also have had a rocky year; I’ll explain more below.

So the fights about the concert, the concert itself was absolutely amazing, I paid for my own ticket, and my parents picked me up and dropped me off at the concert. After the concert, I posted on my story and page some clips of the concert and pics of my outfit, a black mini dress with lace sleeves (mirror pic where I put on lipstick and one at the seats). 

So my bf does not like the band, he calls them demonic, and the day before the concert, he was saying the lyrics are not holy, and I need to be careful. I was genuinely just excited that I got to go to a concert, and when I got home, I posted on socials, and he called me at like 2 am, and I said we’ll talk later, cos I am tired. A day later, he sent me a ChatGPT message saying, 

“I’m hurt by you going to the concert and that our values don’t align, and what other people will think of your post.”
So I replied with a long ass message saying that his message was toxic, controlling, and manipulative, that I paid for the ticket, not him or his friends, and my mom said the pics were fine, so I don’t need his approval. Looking back, I was upset and maybe too harsh.

He sent me more ChatGPT messages saying that my response is “emotionally immature” and that I am not matching his values. I ignored his calls for a few days, cos like, how am I meant to respond to that, and I thought maybe we need a few days to calm down cos it’s probably stress from exams and looking after his mom. He sent this message 2 days later, which I suppose is a break-up message saying that I am “adding to this stress” and “not mature” and that I keep “insulting him” and that he needs someone that “understands him” then I go on instagram and see that he removed my initial from this bio (we had matching bios).

I finally called, and we argued/talked for like 5 hours.
So from the argument, I finally asked,  why he sent that ChatGPT message and what he meant by it, and this is what he said. He said I hurt his feelings by going and by values not aligning, it was cos of the pics I posted, which to him looked “provocative” and  “someone just had sex” (I did not look anything like that). 

He also talked about what his friends, family, or church would think about his “public image” (he barely posts himself). He said I should’ve consulted him cos I’m “publicly tied” to him and he needs to “approve” my pics cos what will other people think, as that concert music is not holy.

For context, my bf is Pentecostal and recently his year, he has been more involved with the Church. He has also rekindled his friendship with his childhood friends, and they are now in a Christian band. Also, for context in the Indian Christian community, the Pentecostal branch is quite special because they don’t like it when people wear gold or dress up, and their values are very, very traditional. My bf also says he is not Pentecostal, he disagrees with what the Church has to say and that he is bible-driven (he spends both Sat and Sun in Church and is always surrounded by his church friends). 

When I first met my bf he wasn’t that super religious, 2 and a half years ago, this is like a recent development from Oct 2024.
Back to the 5-hour argument. Here are some snippets of what was discussed:
He kept saying I shouldn’t have posted cos he’d told me he didn’t like the band, and it disrespected his feelings. He said that I should have gone to the concert and not posted to respect his feelings, as we had a discussion the night before the concert, where he was just being negative. He also said he’s never seen me in that dress (I shop a lot, I own tons of dresses) and that I don’t dress up or wear makeup for him. I said, “Well, you don’t like me wearing makeup cos you complain about the taste, and you never take me on dates where I can dress fancy” He said he’s a uni student with no time or money for nice dates, but I’m a uni student too (plus I work multiple jobs). 
And he said that I never give him any incentive to take me out on nice dates. By incentives, he means explicit pics, and I don’t send many explicit pics cos I cba.


He cares a lot about this public image, which is a recent development. In the argument, he went on about “bro-code” and how his friends and family and church community's opinion matters to him. I only follow people we have in mutual cos same Indian community. He kept saying he wants an “elegant girl” who shares his values, especially cos he’s “short and not that good-looking” (his words, not mine). I asked what he tells his friends and what they think of me anyway (since it matters so much) and he said that he tells his friends that I am hardworking, cos I work a lot and that I can cook;  and he said his friends think that I’m “not all that” and I“look like a lesbian” 

Other parts of the argument include him saying that I don’t respect him, and my reply was very insulting. He brought up things like saying that he could “message any girl”, but he doesn’t cos he respects me (yay for the bare minimum). He also said that the only thing he would regret from leaving me was losing my parents and little brother, cos we always include him in our family dinners, musicals, trips and my dad and he get along with things like fixing the car, and he always eats all of my mom’s food.

There were some other things also discussed in the argument, like how I don’t support him with this music in his church (I donated my bass guitar to his church). He says I am not involved in their church (I am not part of their church, I have my own life), and he said that I never wanted to meet his friends (I have said I would, we can get food together). He said we should all get food in the future after we all go to church.
I said during the argument that I was the one who always had to fight for this relationship, (my parents and my friends have also said he was a red flag) In my defence, he wasn’t that bad when I first met him, like he wasn’t insanely religious. 

We ended the call saying that “we’d work on being better.” After I finally got my nap and wrote down my thoughts and cried to my parents, saying what he told me. I am here now writing to Reddit (very sane of me).


Also, for more context, this isn’t our first fight. The first year we got together, it was fine, we made time for each other. Second year together, we were both busy. I was on placement and it was a lot of work and hours, and he was in his final year of undergrad, busy so we mutually understood the busy and supported each other with it. This half of the year is like wtf happened to the plot line. I’m back at uni finishing my degree, and he is in his master's year.

Like I mentioned before, he got back into the church more, and some insane lore from this period is that his church made him and his friends talk to pastors who say they do exorcism. His church kept sending him back and forth to Wales to help with the sound system in the Wales church.
And he didn’t make any time for me (like, is it that hard to meet up for coffee, we go to the same uni). So I made a big fuss, I know this is pathetic, but I used ChatGPT back then to clean up my thoughts and worries about his church involvement, cos it was getting intense.

And I guess we did come to some type of conclusion from this argument, I said to him, “you can have your time at church, I’m not opposed to it, like I don’t vibe with long services and some Christian music, but I’ll support you from where I can.”
He always says I “don’t understand” him cos I don’t get involved with his church life, which is fair, but tbh, I don’t want to; it’s not my thing (especially not from the drama I hear).  I guess we did come to some sort of compromise with this issue. I’ve asked him to maybe spend less time there, cos he has a lot on his plate with uni, tutoring, church, and odd side jobs here and there. But he says Church isn’t stressful. 
We agreed he gets Saturdays/Sundays for church, and we’d find time in the weekday (I go uni and work during the weekday), but it hasn’t worked, unless I make a big fuss. I don’t expect him to ditch his church, but I wish he’d respect my choices like I respect his.

And like I’ve done so much for him (not to brag). I helped him get out of a dark place, I applied for so many part-time jobs, internships, placements, and I encouraged him to concentrate on uni more. I helped him with his job interviews and now he a nice ass grad job lined up. I’ve made food for his family, and I’m taking his sister to a Kpop concert, cos she asked. I’ve always paid at least half on everything from food to hotel rooms, and I would say I’m a pretty decent gift giver too.
I welcomed him into my family, I set up the tutoring business for him as I gave him my brother as his first student and then introduced him to family friends. I have helped with his uni research, and I’ve listened to his conspiracy theories and rants, even about Andrew Tate (who I absolutely hate).
And sometimes, I get told that I am not doing enough compared to other relationships (what are other people doing in relationships - apparently I am doing it wrong).


I’m not perfect either. I can be dramatic and opinionated, like when I called his messages “toxic” and I haven’t read the Bible (I’m Christian but not active with my faith), and then I go and argue about it with him who’s read it twice. And sometimes my arguing just goes round in circles, and I ask too many questions. And maybe I should have been involved with his Church, like at least gone to one event ( I did to one like a youth meeting thing, but I left early). And I know my communication could have been better. And I know we are not aligned with some values, but I was always committed to him and helped the best I could.


And like despite all this, there is part of me that does love him and respect him, like usually when he says these things to me is when he is going through a stressful time. But he is nice and lovely most of the time. When I first met him, he helped with my mental health, and when I was feeling stressed and lonely at uni, he was there for me, and I got much better, like he did support me.
And he also met all my standards for a guy, like I wanted an educated guy who is hardworking and likes me. My bf even raised some standards, 
And when we first started going out, he would set time for me with study dates.

And I know I am lucky to have him, it’s not like I’m the prettiest person out there and not the smartest, so I felt so happy when I found someone who liked me and wanted to be with me. He even got along with my family and was always there when we needed him. He even loved all my insecurities, like my acne issues. And I think I gave my everything, but why does it feel like all the hard work I’ve done for the past few years feels like nothing?
Like right now, I guess I’m torn, like I do love him. But I don’t know, it’s just the past few months he has changed so much, and it feels so toxic. 
Like everyone says, I deserve better, but are there better guys out there? Like I spent so much time with him, and I thought that we pushed each other to be the best person possible. It feels like I am losing him to Church and his “values”. Like, I may not be an active Christian, but his values are def not Christian from what I can see.
And I guess I am kinda scared of losing that part of me, and worried I might spiral, I’ve never been through a breakup and what if my mental health gets worse again. Like I’ve talked to my parents, friends, even ranted to Ai, and I’m not sure what to do. Like I like the music I listen to, I like my autonomy on what I like to wear and where I like to go out. But he was there for me.
I’m not looking for judgment, just some honest advice from people who’ve been through something similar. I’m trying to figure out if this relationship is still healthy for me, and if it can grow, or if it’s time to let go
Like you guys can be honest, and if I sound anything like a pick-me girl, please let me know so I can work on that.

This is honestly tearing me apart and I'm hoping someone out there among the potatoes can give me any kind of solid advice. I'll try to provide as much context as possible, so I'm sorry if this runs on. *Names have been changed just in case!

I (45/f) and my ride or die (46/f) ""Robin"" have known each other since our first day of college at 19. We were both terrified little suburbs girls, out on our own for the first time in the big scary world and totally lost. Somehow we found each other on orientation day and we've been joined at the hip ever since. We both had similar childhoods, though I had an older brother and she was the middle child of three sisters. I was very much a tomboy growing up, content to play GI Joe or ninja turtles with my brother, while she was a Barbie/Cabbage Patch kid. We both were pretty average students, average in popularity at school, we later joked we must've been separated at birth. 

Somehow, we met at orientation at college since we seemed to be the sort of odd ones out. Everyone seemed to know someone already, so we gravitated to each other and went for coffee. We ended up talking for hours! It was like meeting a long lost sister. While we were still very different, somehow we were deeply alike. Same sense of humor, loved a lot of the same things (books, movies, music, men lol). We brought out the best in each other, she taught me to do my makeup, I taught her about football stats to impress guys. We often double dated and gave each other advice on the guys we were with. Men never came between us, nobody could. We were the best of friends, closer than sisters and swore we'd forever be there for each other. I was a bridesmaid at her wedding, she gave me a graduation party (she left college to marry her high school sweetheart). I was there for her later divorce after ten years of marriage, she was there when my father passed away. We thought we'd be besties forever. 

Until...

Now, I want to stress NOTHING has happened between her man and I. Nothing in any way, shape or form inappropriate. When she began dating again, I encouraged her and we started doubling again. Unfortunately, I was single when she met ""Andrew"", but she insisted I wouldn't be a third wheel. When I first met him, it was like one of those stupid rom-com scenes where the music comes up and doves flutter. He is incredibly gorgeous, a veteran with his own business. At first I thought I was just taken by how attractive he was and ignored it. But I started to notice we liked the same music (Robin hates country), we both love to cook, share the same interest in horror movies... I often notice Andrew and I are the only ones playing pool or deep in conversation at the occasional party. Still, we have NEVER been inappropriate, or even alone together. Robin has always been with us, either on a double date, a party, work function, etc. 

When I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2024, she was by my side any time I needed her. For the biopsy, diagnosis, surgery, she was there even more than family. Until one day... I was having treatment and my transportation never showed up. I had no way to get home and I knew she was at work but I texted to let her know what was happening. Andrew showed up to drive me home. Robin has sent him and I was floored. He'd just gotten home from work himself but drove across town to get me. He got me a shake from McDonald's and brought me home. We did hug at my door. I was drained and emotional from treatment. I knew then I was in trouble.

I've started avoiding the double dates and parties, Robin thinks it's because of my illness but I feel like a total rat. I've been attracted to Andrew since the day we met and now I just can't face him, knowing I'm betraying my bestest friend. Should I tell her or just let her believe it's my cancer slowing me down? I honestly don't know what Andrew thinks/feels about me, I can't possibly talk to him about it. What do I do, fellow potatoes? AITA? ",3,1746588975.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,6,1.0,False

Next comes a fairly aggressive burn…I think this is pretty cool they managed to replicate the burn. 2 mins later I spit it out as I was getting sweaty and dizzy.. well played Mr Buffalo..EXCEPT..I got the 11.5mg ones…I didn’t know they had nicotine versions. 🤣 It was very obvious once I looked at the case that it was nicotine.  A waste of 24 hours and $5.00 but it was fairly comical that I had to pull over and drink some water and get fresh air. This will be my first time quitting on my own without my job making me. I had to for 3 weeks for SERE training (shitty camping trip hosted by the Army where you get in trouble for camping in the wrong spot) That wasn’t too bad.. so we shall see. Good luck to the rest of you. 🍀 ,2,1746588856.0,QuittingZyn,2,1.0,False

1kgnqgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1kgnqgq/new_salt_straw_recipe_book_list_of_recipes/,New Salt & Straw Recipe Book - List of Recipes,"No one asked for this, but here it is anyway. A full list of all the recipes included in Salt & Straw's newest book, *America's Most Iconic Ice Creams: Classic Flavors and Creative Riffs*.

I liked the first book of recipes S&S put out and I was excited to see this new one. I wanted to see a list of all the recipes to help decide if I should buy it or not, but coudn't find anything on the interwebs beyond the list of iconic flavors. Didn't have time to go to an actual store to check it out either. So I bought it and figured I'd post the info I would've wanted and maybe someone else would too.

I have not made any of these yet, so I can't make any recommendations.

So far, my only critique about this book is how the sections are organized. From the Vanilla to Salted Caramel sections, each recipe has the section title’s ingredient in it (Chocolate, strawberry, etc). But when you get to Pistachio, it only has one pistachio recipe and the rest are nut flavored recipes. Why not just call that section “nuts?” Same with the Green Tea section and Rum Raisin. One is all tea-based flavors and the other has alcohol in each recipe. Not sure the reasoning for this. At first I honestly thought pages were missing.

As such, I retitled those sections here to avoid confusion.

Hope this helps you decide if you want to buy the book or not. And please excuse any typos.

Baby has lost its heartbeat,"Yesterday I started having discharge with light brown tint. As it was national holiday and discharge was not strong so I kept calm. I had read that some blood could be seen throughout pregnancy. But today morning I had now darker brown and stronger discharge and two spots on pants. In the shower I caught one coffee bean size dark red jelly like clot and knew it was bad. 

I also saw a nightmare tonight, that I had a miscarriage.
My clinic today also has day off, but they do urgent checks. They were kind enough to take me in today. 

And then the nightmare became true. 
Doctor did the ultrasound and found no heartbeat, baby’s body was measuring 9w2d, motionless, but I was supposed to be already on 10w5d. 
I understand this is missed miscarriage. 
I was asked to come back tomorrow and take slow today. 

Triggering thing is…
I graduated fertility clinic just 2 and a half weeks ago. I had my first appointment at regular doctor week and a half ago. Saw the heartbeat and doctor said he is concerned about fibroid. I have been told 6 years ago when it was first found, that it might make getting pregnant difficult. At fertility clinic nothing was told about it. At current clinic doctor seemed concerned as the fibroid is large and degenerate. Maybe it only became so due to pregnancy, I was in my understanding, not told much about it. But doctor did tell to contact if any bleeding is seen before 12 weeks. 

This was my first FET baby, embryo was 4AA grade. 
I have 7 more embryos in fertility clinic. 
Two of them 4AA

I’m doing this all procedure in Japanese, so many new words, I have been okay mostly going to clinic alone this whole time, but tomorrow I hope my husband can take off work and come to clinic with me. I don’t know if I can properly process information in the state I’m now. Doing it in Japanese has been already challenging enough. I often research new words after wards. 

Maybe some advice what should I prepare to ask hdoctor for miscarriage(baby is still in me)/ fibroid/ next FET?

So I decided to get a simple robovac that only has a vacuum feature. After some research, I settled on ecovacs x5 hybrid, I didn't care much about its removable stick but it turns out I use it a lot more often than I thought.I found it quite useful for quick cleanups, yesterday morning I spilled some coffee powder on the floor, I just picked up the stick and moved the robot to where I wanted it to be, pressed the power button on the stick and done. I don't have to open the app - select the cleaning area - and wait for the robovac to take its time. Honestly, it'a lot easier than I thought, just give it a gentle push and the robovac moves smoothly. The suction is also good, no problem picking up long hairs and does not tangle at all. Now I run it every day to keep my carpet clean, but quick question: what do you guys do with wet stains on carpets? please let me know in the comment!

(Me and literally everyone else who took ap chem was late to ap gov testing because it started right when ap chem ended. i was SO HUNGRY and i needed to pee so BADLY but i had to wait till the break omg.) i was so burnt out by the end of the day

Anyways

MCQ for apchem was kinda light(?)

FRQs I didn't have enough time to finish, I knew how to do mostly everything but I work really slowly + I took my ADHD meds this morning w/ coffee and my hands were shaking throughout both exams and it rly did something to my brain but i could NOT have taken the exams w/o my meds 

anyways my teacher prepared us really well for the exam, her tests were twice as hard as the exam was and she helped us develop a really strong conceptual basis for chemistry. my problem isn't the AP exam per say, rather the class. Don't get me wrong -- I have a FANTASTIC chem teacher and I loved apchem the whole way through (excluding acids + bases and equilibria). 

my problem is that im dumb as hell. ive gotten Cs on some tests that i studied really hard for (reviewing notes, past problems, going to help sessions) and it's so disheartening because even tho my overall grade is decent enough, my friends that have studied less than me have consistently gotten better grades than me and i feel so stupid. i really wanted to major in chem or biochem but tbh idrk anymore... i look back at my old tests and quizzes and im like ""wow how the helly did i even think this would be right"" but i feel so confident every time i take a ap chem test. idk i feel so dumb and ive been so burnt out and tired the past 2-3 weeks i literally gave up and got a C on the last test we took (which was last thursday btw??) on K and gibbs free energy. im so dumb i put so much time and effort into this class and i was always excited to go to apchem but idk anymore... i couldve gotten the same grades with less effort and time. i feel so stupid like i shouldve put my time into something that i couldve actually succeeded at... 

i also rly wish i had gotten my ADHD diagnosis earlier and started my meds earlier (i started 2 weeks ago) bc it turns out my ADHD is worse than it is for most people that have ADHD and the medicine has helped me SO MUCH i cant even put it into words. i feel like im unstoppable when im on my meds and they would've made such a positive impact earlier.

I'm interested in ordering an Odin2 Portal Pro. I currently have flights booked to visit my family in the US in July, but with the tariff debacle going on right now, I'm reconsidering where and how I should have this device delivered.

I've seen a few posts and comments where DHL is requesting hundreds of dollars on top the retail price for these devices, which is something I definitely want to avoid. Since I'm in Vietnam (which literally shares a border with China), I'm wondering if I should order it to be delivered here? 

Customs in VN is a nightmare. Often times, if a package is sent here via USPS or a general carrier, all tracking information literally gets ""lost"" entering this country. Shipping typically takes anywhere from four to six weeks. And by the time you're able to sleuth and find out which local delivery company or customs facility has your package, you have to go there in-person, wait a few hours, and then get charged an arbitrary amount from a customs agent based on how much coffee money he wants to pocket that day.  
  
Anecdotal: I've actually had one good experience using DHL in the past (which hasn't always been an available delivery option), when I ordered a Lenovo Legion Y700 tablet from Giztop. During that time (2022), I receive an email from DHL with the import Duties & Taxes and Customs fees I needed to pay for them to relinquish the package and deliver it to my apartment.

  
I emailed Ayn with a few very specific questions regarding delivery time estimates, tariffs, delivery options, etc. It took them four days to reply back and they ignored all but one of my questions and simply responded back with: *""This device is in stock, you can choose DHL, we will arrange delivery as soon as possible after placing the order. Thank you.""*

  
Hence, why I'm here. I understand my situation might be a little more nuanced. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any feedback or ideas on how to proceed. Thanks for taking the time to read and reply.",1,1746587736.0,OdinHandheld,0,1.0,False

I hear only birds chirping.

# Best Marble Sealer 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Marble, a timeless and elegant natural stone, adds a touch of luxury to any space. However, its porous nature makes it susceptible to staining, etching, and water damage. A high-quality marble sealer is essential to protect your investment and maintain its beauty for years to come. This comprehensive guide reviews the best marble sealers of 2025, providing insights to help you choose the perfect product for your needs.

[[Browse top-rated marble sealer on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=marble+sealer)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a marble sealer hinges on several critical features that determine its ability to protect and preserve the stone's integrity.

**Penetrating vs. Topical Sealers:** Penetrating sealers are designed to soak into the marble's pores, creating a protective barrier from within. This type of sealer doesn't alter the marble's natural appearance or breathability. Topical sealers, on the other hand, form a protective layer on the surface. While they may offer more stain resistance, they can change the marble's look and feel and potentially trap moisture.

**Water-Based vs. Solvent-Based Formulas:** Water-based sealers are generally considered more environmentally friendly and have lower VOC (volatile organic compound) levels, making them safer to use indoors. They tend to be less durable than solvent-based sealers but are still effective for most household applications. Solvent-based sealers offer superior water and oil repellency but can have a strong odor and require more careful ventilation during application.

**Stain Repellency and Etch Resistance:** The primary function of a marble sealer is to repel stains caused by common household spills like coffee, wine, and oils. Some sealers also offer a degree of etch resistance, protecting the marble from acidic substances like lemon juice or vinegar. The level of protection varies between products, so it's essential to choose one that matches your specific needs and the likelihood of exposure to these substances.

**Breathability and Vapor Permeability:** Marble needs to breathe to prevent moisture buildup beneath the surface, which can lead to discoloration or cracking. A breathable sealer allows water vapor to escape while preventing liquids from penetrating, maintaining the marble's integrity over time. Look for sealers specifically designed for natural stone that allow for proper vapor transmission.

**UV Resistance and Color Enhancement:** Some sealers offer UV resistance to prevent fading or discoloration from prolonged exposure to sunlight. Additionally, certain products may enhance the marble's natural color and veining, while others maintain a more natural, matte finish. The choice depends on your aesthetic preferences.

Key features to consider when evaluating marble sealers include:

*   Penetrating or Topical formula
*   Water-based or Solvent-based composition
*   Stain and etch resistance levels
*   Breathability and vapor permeability
*   UV resistance and color enhancement

 ## Core Benefits

A high-quality marble sealer provides a multitude of benefits, extending the lifespan and beauty of your marble surfaces.

**Enhanced Protection:** The most significant benefit is the protection against stains, spills, and everyday wear and tear. A good sealer creates a barrier that prevents liquids from penetrating the porous surface, keeping your marble looking pristine. This protection reduces the need for aggressive cleaning methods that can damage the stone.

**Prolonged Lifespan:** By preventing damage from water and acidic substances, a sealer extends the lifespan of your marble surfaces. Without protection, marble can become stained, etched, and weakened over time, requiring costly repairs or replacement. Sealing helps maintain the structural integrity of the stone, ensuring it lasts for years to come.

**Easier Maintenance:** Sealed marble is much easier to clean and maintain. Spills can be quickly wiped away without leaving permanent stains, and regular cleaning requires only mild soap and water. This reduces the time and effort needed to keep your marble surfaces looking their best.

**Improved Aesthetics:** Certain sealers can enhance the natural color and veining of marble, adding depth and richness to its appearance. Others maintain a natural, matte finish, preserving the stone's original look. Regardless of your preference, a good sealer will enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of your marble surfaces.

**Prevention of Microbial Growth:** By preventing moisture penetration, a sealer also inhibits the growth of mold, mildew, and bacteria within the marble's pores. This is particularly important in wet areas like bathrooms and kitchens, where moisture is prevalent. Preventing microbial growth promotes a healthier environment.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions can help clarify concerns and guide the decision-making process.

**How often should I seal my marble surfaces?**
    The frequency of sealing depends on the type of sealer used and the level of traffic the surface receives. As a general rule, high-traffic areas like kitchen countertops should be sealed every 6-12 months, while low-traffic areas like bathroom vanities may only need sealing every 1-2 years. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations.

**Can I use any type of sealer on marble?**
    No, it's crucial to use a sealer specifically designed for natural stone. Sealers intended for other surfaces, like granite or ceramic tile, may not be compatible with marble and can cause damage or discoloration. Always check the product label to ensure it's safe for marble.

**How do I test if my marble needs resealing?**
    A simple water test can help determine if your marble needs resealing. Pour a small amount of water onto the surface and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. If the water beads up, the sealer is still effective. If the water soaks into the marble, it's time to reseal.

**What are the common mistakes to avoid when sealing marble?**
    Common mistakes include applying too much sealer, not wiping off excess sealer, and using the wrong type of sealer. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, and avoid applying sealer in direct sunlight or humid conditions. Ensure proper ventilation during application, especially with solvent-based sealers.

    *   **Breathability:** Poor

### Key Differences Summary

ABC Marble Sealer excels in breathability and maintaining the natural look of marble, making it suitable for users prioritizing these aspects. XYZ Marble Protector provides superior stain resistance and moderate etch protection, ideal for high-traffic areas prone to spills. StoneGuard Marble Shield offers the highest level of etch resistance and noticeable color enhancement, but its topical application compromises breathability and can alter the marble's texture. For users seeking a balance of protection and natural appearance, ABC Marble Sealer or XYZ Marble Protector are preferable, while StoneGuard Marble Shield is a strong choice for those prioritizing stain and etch resistance above all else.

 ## Ideal User Profile

Different users have varying needs and priorities when it comes to marble sealing.

**Homeowners with High-End Marble:** Homeowners who have invested in expensive marble countertops, floors, or vanities require a sealer that provides maximum protection without altering the stone's natural beauty. They typically prioritize stain resistance, etch resistance, and UV protection to maintain the value and appearance of their investment. Products like XYZ Marble Protector, with its solvent base and enhanced protection, are suitable for this user profile.

**DIY Enthusiasts:** Individuals who prefer to handle home improvement projects themselves often look for user-friendly sealers that are easy to apply and maintain. Water-based sealers like ABC Marble Sealer are ideal for DIY enthusiasts due to their low odor, ease of application, and environmental friendliness. These users often value convenience and safety over maximum protection.

**Commercial Property Managers:** Commercial properties with marble surfaces, such as hotels or office buildings, require sealers that can withstand heavy traffic and frequent cleaning. Durability, stain resistance, and ease of maintenance are crucial factors for these users. A balance between cost-effectiveness and long-lasting protection is typically preferred.

 ## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

When selecting a marble sealer, consider the specific application, the type of marble, and your personal preferences. For high-traffic areas prone to spills and stains, a solvent-based sealer with high stain resistance may be the best choice. For areas where maintaining the marble's natural look is a priority, a water-based sealer with excellent breathability is preferable. If etch resistance is a primary concern, a topical sealer may provide the best protection, but be aware of the potential drawbacks in terms of breathability and altered appearance.

Overall, choosing the right marble sealer is crucial for protecting your investment and preserving the beauty of your marble surfaces. The products discussed in this guide represent some of the best options available in 2025, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. By carefully considering your needs and priorities, you can select the perfect sealer to keep your marble looking its best for years to come.

Batch: C924

Proof: 125.1

Age: NAS though assumed to be 6-8 years old

Mashbill: 68% corn, 20% wheat, 12% malted barley

Price: $65

Nose: it’s got a bit of sour funk on the nose, almost a bit like a Wild Turkey 101. My nosing notes are never very good (I think Covid messed something up) so I’ll leave it at that. 

Palate: first sip is very sweet, and then some bitter spicy oak on the back end. Further sips reveal brown sugar, honey, and dark chocolate. There’s definitely a spicy (but not quite bitter) oak on the back end that reminds me a bit of freshly ground white peppercorns. A bit of coffee / mocha as well. 

Finish: medium length, nothing to write home about, but not bad. It’s got good viscosity and is not at all watery. 

Rating: 7.5/10. It’s a solid barrel proof wheater and I like the flavors a lot. I think I paid $65 for it so that’s decent value. One day I’ll try a Maker’s Mark Cask Strength or a 46 Cask Strength to have a comparison point for a similarly priced barrel proof wheated bourbon (never gonna see Weller Full Proof lol)

1kgn4an,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1kgn4an/my_thoughts_on_star_citizen_backer_since_2013/,My Thoughts on Star Citizen - Backer Since 2013,"# Brief Background

I backed Star Citizen way back in 2013/2014 as a young, naïve 21/22 year old that grew up on RPGs and had a special love for *Wing Commander*, *Starlancer,* and *Freelancer*. I didn't expect too much, but I certainly did expect SQ42 to be out by 2016 instead of 2026. That being said, I can't say I'm entirely dissatisfied, and I'll explain why, but I thought it was important to note I've played the game through most of its phases on and off for the last 12 years.

# Star Citizen — The Idea

The thing that captured me about Star Citizen was the *idea* of it. It wasn't the fantastical elements or the crazy scope or even the crazy Fleet Battle possibilities (at least, not initially). In fact, it was the idea of *exploring*. See, if you've played *Freelancer,* then you know exactly what I'm talking about, especially with the *Discovery* mod. Exploration is such a cool and immersive part of space sims, and games like *Elite: Dangerous* really nail this down.

So my thought was that, with someone as ambitious as Chris Roberts at the helm, Star Citizen would be a dream come true for boldly going where no one has gone before. **StarEngine** and **Genesis** made this even more exciting, and the idea of **StarChitect** and **StarSim** seemed to be painting a universe of possibility where the only limits of *discovery*—heh, I couldn't resist—was your own imagination. I envisioned conquering Star Systems, founding colonies, planting my Org's flag across the frontier of the Cosmos, and becoming a happy little ~~despot~~ Administrator in some fledgling frontier system.

Then came the **1.0** release view, and my Kirk Palpatine dreams ended up looking like pure fantasy after all.

I'm sure exploration will be scratched in the eventual **1.X** content drops with new systems and more using **StarChitect**, but the fantasy of it all firmly went down in flames.

Despite this however, the idea of Star Citizen has not lost its hold on me.

The *idea*.

It's hard, sometimes, to really remember why it is that so many of us bought into this game—and I know there are a *myriad* of reasons for you all—in the first place. Pessimism, cynicism, the oopsies of CIG's repeated mismanagement of resources, development, et cetera, have all pooled together to create a playerbase that is simultaneously rabidly supportive and viciously critical. However, I think it's important to remember that at some point, before all the negativity, the anger, the disappointment, the missed deadlines—there was a simpler element to why we invested.

The idea.

The dream.

The *possibility.*

Which brings me, after that little ramble, to my actual thoughts on the state of the game.

# Star Citizen — The Reality

Star Citizen is a flawed product in many ways, and a surprisingly full-bodied one in others.

The positives, of course, are its flight system, the visceral nature of combat both in space and on the ground, the attention to detail around ship design, articulation, special effects, physics, dynamic damage (sort of), and the very real and punishing realities of velocity and inertia in the deep black. The gameplay loops, or the current incarnation of them, provide some semblance of fulfilling repetition. Diggy diggy hole remains diggy diggy hole, and for the truly wealth-driven among us, hauling and piracy both represent different but comparable means of achieving our space tycoon dreams.

That being said, it is when you look for the *next step* that things become more dicey.

There's only so many times you can Bounty Hunt in an asteroid belt before it feels samey, there's only so many ships you can buy with hard-won UEC before it feels like a relentless bore. There are only so many Hathor Sites, Executive Hangars, and Contested Zones you can fight over before it all starts to feel a little stale. That isn't to knock anyone who enjoys those playstyles, and I'm certainly not deriding the content. Still, in my *personal* opinion, two major elements are missing that would really compel me to continue logging in.

Player population and a living economy.

Right now, and I'm sure this is a contentious viewpoint, I believe the most bitter disappointment about Star Citizen—no, it isn't Master Modes, you Khornate Berserkers—is the lack of *community* within the living world. Now, please don't confuse that as an indictment of the player base, or even an indictment of the game itself. This is, candidly, a result of the path toward release—but remains a massive point of discontent for me personally.

I am a D&D forever-DM, an amateur author, and more than anything else, an *avid* roleplayer. Every game I play, I dabble in roleplay, whether it's my 3,500+ mod Skyrim playthroughs, various MMOs, or other avenues of pursuit—I love to immerse myself in the game world. For me, this is never better highlighted than with the interaction of players with players. Countless times I've thought of making a ""Friend me, let's build an artificial roleplay Shard!"" reddit post, but I chickened out each time—primarily due to my own pessimism for the concept's popularity, and partially due to concerns of trolling, admittedly.

But I digress.

Population and Economy. Without these elements, even before Base Building, Crafting, Space Stations, et cetera, there remains a poignant hole in the simulation of Star Citizen's living universe. Context, consequence, and compelling interactions fall short because there is no active investment among players. I want to go to MicroTech, or CRU-L1, or Orison, or ArcCorp and offer escort services to trading barons, negotiate safe conduct deals with renegades, and hunt down notorious pirate gangs. I want a living universe where transactional interaction *breeds* immersion, and where UEC lives and breathes in Star Citizen.

I don't need the fully realized FOIP-VOIP combination, but it certainly would be nice to have the Org updates and new **MobiGlass** functionality put into the game, so that we *can* have a living universe. Frankly, the lack of something as simple as Org tags and dyeable armor/applyable Org colours **13 years on** is bewildering. It remains my largest point of frustration around Star Citizen: the lack of player identity in the 'Verse and the lack of population counts and fundamental systems required for a living universe.

With that said, let's pivot back to some hopium.

**Rich Tyrer** showed us some fantastic things at **CitizenCon 2954,** and while I remain, as always, cautiously optimistic, I have to say that I do believe Star Citizen in its current state is closer to release than it's ever been.

""Well, of course it is, idiot, it's been 13 years.""

Fair enough, but that was not my point!

The difference in developmental focus and priority these past months compared to the last decade is notable. The fixation on QoL, the streamlined (somewhat) pipeline for ship release, and the obvious sprint toward a 2026 SQ42 release (I know, I know) remain points of considerable noblebright in a grimdark development canvas. I'm fast-approaching my mid-thirties at an alarming rate, and with children in the near future looking highly possible, part of me wonders if I'm simply walking the path so that my heirs can eventually run. Will it be my children that actually end up experiencing the fantastical world that I dreamt of as a younger man? The thought both disturbs me and has an element of poetic satisfaction to it.

""I held the line,"" I'll say to them, while imagining the mocking laughter of the millions of backers that understand how copium-infused that statement is. ""I held the line so that you could fly the stars.""

My hope is that I will instead welcome my kids into a world that has already met and exceeded my expectations, and have a game that my partner and I can play together—she does love Star Citizen—while teaching our children how to play the virtual shares market. My hope is that in 2028, I'll be playing the Main Story, traversing from Stanton, to Terra, to Castra, and exploring the early examples of the vast might of the UEE. My hope, my fellow Citizens, is that I'll meet you all in regional mega-shards and exchange fire, UEC, and Cruz Luxes while arguing over which variant of the Lightning is better to fly despite its atrocious handling.

Whatever the future brings, my view on Star Citizen is one of optimism, not because I choose to ignore the facts, but because I want, I *desperately* want to believe in spite of them. My view on Star Citizen is that it is a game made by dreamers, for dreamers, to bring us in touch with the Universe the same way that Lucas brought us in touch with the Force. It is an imperfect game, a flawed game, a game plagued by poor choices and idealistic and ambitious choices—but one I cannot help but come back to, year after year, patch after patch, because of the endless hope that one day I will sail the stars, full-body VR and all.

I want that for all of you. I want that for my kids. I want that for those who passed before they could experience it.

So, 12 years on, I continue to hope.

And when I see you from the bridge of my *Javelin*, sipping my coffee while my son or daughter destroys my Engineering presets to the alarm of my crew, I hope you'll wave and say, ""Hey, man. We did it. *We held the line.*""",18,1746586563.0,starcitizen,11,0.75,False

1. Why did Billy spontaneously abandon his family for the wolf? I never got why he had such an extreme admiration for the wolf. And his relationship with his family seemed decent, definitely not enough to run away like that for a stray wolf.
2. Who killed Billy and Boyd's parents? Was it the man at the start of the book who asked for coffee and food?
3. Why did Boyd run away? Was it because he never forgave Billy?
4. Having run away, why did Boyd suddenly become a gunslinger? I never got the vibe he had violent ideas in his head. He never resembled the Kid from Blood Meridian in any way.
5. Finally, please help me clarify what the heck the Catholic man and the blind man who take Billy in and feed him were talking about? I know they sum up the central themes of the novel but it was so dense and confusing I sort of lost track of the bigger picture.

I have been physically unwell due to binge eating bad food for months. Ive put on a lot of weight, maybe 10kg. My stomach aches from gorging myself daily.

I just had my healthy breakfast and coffee when I saw the free snack bowl provided by my hostel in front of me. I told myself I didn't need them, I already felt full.

I had one anyway. I told myself one was okay. But then I had more. And then I had more.

6 cookies in total. By the 5th I was tearing up. I kept eating as I cried. And it's not about the cookies. This is far from a large binge for me. It's about how food has taken over my life. I want to eat all the time: when I'm full, when I'm not full; when I'm sick, when I'm not sick.

I feel trapped in this. I can't look at my changing body in the mirror. I walk past the mirror, eyes averted, to get another quick fix from the kitchen. 

There is self-blame, there is anger with myself, guilt, loathing. I'm not entirely sure that this is fair. I am a victim of this, as well as the perpetrator. Should I have equal disdain and care for myself, or do they cancel each other out? Or is my perpetratorship itself a form of victimisation; the subconscious and unreachable parts of myself holding hostage the parts of me that feel more truly ""me""?

This only my second go at a medication since my adhd diagnosis, but I was getting really bad these last few years and finally was able to settle down somewhere and connect with a psych. 

Taking Wellbutrin XL 150mg generic (Rising), once in the morning, and I’m having some side effects I wasn’t expecting!! 

I’m on the third day in my first week, and I’ve been experiencing this haze of drowsiness, not too intensive. It’s just like a lite filter over my day, I can do my job, but when I get home I feel more fatigued. Also the last 2 days around the 11 hour mark since taking my dose I’ve started getting a wave of depression. I also don’t have very noticeable emotional reactions throughout the day atm. I’m mostly on a neutral baseline I suppose?? The upside is, strangely, for now, my anxiety is actually a lot less. 

I know this medication takes a couple weeks to work out side effects, so I’m gonna keep going since it’s not exactly unbearable. Just a little inconvenient I guess? 

Let me know if you’ve experienced anything similar, some encouragement that things may change 😅

For some more context, I’ve been essentially “self medicating” with caffeine since I was 12, and am used to having 100-200mg of caffeine per day. I used to have energy drinks but I quit them for the most part about 4-5 years ago. Once in a blue moon I’ll have one if I have a really busy day ahead. 

I did cut down to one cup of coffee in the morning for this medication to account for the stimulant effects, but I’ve had none so far haha.

I am *pumped* for consolidation because i ended up with my very first choice, in medicine at the hospital which is sooooo much better than long-term care (IMO).  

the very last day of the semester, our teacher was nice enough to offer a mock exam if we came to the school to do it.  of course, i did and just barely passed with a 72.  a friend of mine i consider a great student and really smart did basically the same and barely passed.  in fact, quite a few people i consider smart and studious ended up getting around the same grade.  it worried me a little.

for the first five days of my break, i had a routine going where i would have breakfast and a leisurely morning, start studying at noon, take a coffee break at 3:00, study again until 5, go for a jog, have dinner and mess around on the computer until basically as late as i wanted.  by the end of the fifth day, my brain was soup and, as i told a friend, i felt like Van Gogh with his ear cut off.  in this time, i made well over 400 pages of notes.  i took a few days off and felt guilty about it but absolutely *could not* keep studying without hurting myself.  before the test, i met up with a friend in the library and we went through some quizzes together.  we were averaging about 72% again and i was kind of pissed that all my studying had done basically nothing and i was pretty nervous going into the exam.

the exam starts and it's nothing like my study material.  frankly, my study material was way more advanced than this.  i'm thinking, like, am i missing something here?  am i completely off with every question?  i'm not trying to brag, i'm just saying i was sort of freaking out that i was way off because it felt so easy and didn't really know how to feel about it when it was over.  i was still sure i'd passed at least.

Neary tried to convince the both of them that the Commodore's plan would work and that they would make more money with less hassles, but Fleming didn't want to go along with it because he was loyal to Nucky, didn't want him to go to jail, was content with the money he was making with Nucky in charge, and brought up the road appropriations that they were all in on together being Nucky's deal.  O'Neil folded right away, but when Fleming refused to go along, Neary told him that ""Anybody who didn't sign on, he'll be lucky to work the boards with a broom and a dustpan.""

In the beginning of S3E1, after Gyp Rosetti beat the man to death over 3-in-1, the following scene showed a kid running on the boardwalk, but before he picked up the coffee and breakfast for Nucky and his men, he passed the former ward boss Boyd in his last appearance on the show sweeping the boards with a broom and a dustpan.  

Obviously, Nucky didn't want anyone who was part of the plot against him to remain in power, but it's ironic how Boyd ends up doing exactly what Neary told Fleming he would be doing while Fleming was rewarded for his loyalty with a promotion from ward boss to county treasurer.

context: I work at a coffee shop and used to have a pair of white nokwol platform sneakers and lamoda platform zip up ankle boots. 

my white platforms needed to be retired because they were dirty and the soles were disintegrating. the lamoda boots were new but cracked on the platform (😐). sooo, I finally convinced myself to splurge the money on new rocks (tanks) since I’ve wanted them for years but have money anxiety and didn’t want to spend the $$$. thus currently my new rocks are the only shoes I have to wear to work (the only other shoes I own are trail running shoes, hiking boots and chacos/teva sandals and slides which I can’t wear to work at the coffee shop). I love them but they don’t go with every outfit and also I’m getting tired of wearing only those shoes to work every day (they’re a bit heavy after 9-10 hour long shifts). urgg this is such a first world problem, I apologize, but I ask nonetheless.. 

I’ve been looking at Buffalo London platform sneakers/loafers, doc marten zebzags, skechers jammers, birkenstock clogs, demonias, or converse one star or cruise sneakers or converse all star platforms.

We have always had one operable vehicle and once or twice a month, I’d drive to a shopping center to walk around.

We moved two years ago. My driving is restricted now, thanks to health issues, and nothing is within walking distance other than a gas station. We order groceries and doordash dinner about 4 times each pay period. It is an exorbitant waste of money. I am cooped up in the house almost the entire month, and have suggested multiple times that I can place the order and go pick it up. Usually with that suggestion the conversation fizzles, he brings up my health issues (which haven’t flared up since February), or deflects and we order delivery anyway.

When I last brought this up, he rolled his eyes and said families don’t go out that often. I tried to cut him off and say I wasn’t asking for an outing, but he complained about me being high maintenance and said we aren’t rich. Which, no shit sherlock, but the money we spend on delivery fees, tips, and doordash prices would open the budget for A LOT.

1kgmo1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kgmo1f/aio_girlfriend_went_through_my_phone/,"AIO, girlfriend went through my phone","To make a long story somewhat short, one Sunday morning, I (25M) woke up wondering where my gf (28) was. After a while of laying in bed, she came and sat down, obviously distressed and said “I need to tell you something”

I listened while she explained that she had gone through my phone while I slept the night before. She brought up text messages with a female friend of mine, which we will get to later. 

At this point I was upset about her going through my phone, and hardly listened to her other complains before leaving the house to go clear my head. 

To make a long story short, I’m a recovering addict/alcoholic. Due to strange circumstances, BEFORE my gf and I were dating, I “sponsored” a good friend of mine, that happened to be a girl. We have never made any sort of advance to each other, never had romantic feelings, and it was always platonic. 

I helped her out when she first got sober, and just generally supported her the way friends do. I took her to her first AA meeting and we are good friends. She is also married, I should point out. 

My gf has *always* resented that a little bit, usually being quiet and aloof for at least a day whenever I went to see her. Usually we meet at a chicken chef for coffee. 

After lots of fighting, and couples therapy the reason given for going through my phone was because:

My gf has a friend who *is* married and was *just* cheated on by her husband after having several children. I had gone through something very hard last year, and while I was working through that, my gf and I were distant. All her girl friends told her that the most likely explanation (of course) is that I was cheating. 

My girlfriend worked very hard through text messages and fights after admitting to going through my phone to make it seem like I was cheating on her, or at least being very inappropriate with my female friend and stepping outside relationship boundaries. 

She admitted later in therapy that I’ve never given her any reason to think I was being unfaithful, nor to suspect it. 

For a while, I didn’t think it was something I could move past. She consistently downplayed the fact that I was angry about her going through my phone and used the classic “you’re upset so you must be hiding something”

It took probably 2 months to get to a point where she actually apologized for it, without insinuating she had to do it. Before several counselling sessions, she said clearly that she was glad she had done it, so that she knows we’re incompatible now and not 5 years later. 

Anyways, I am still struggling with moving past this. I have *forgiven* her but it’s changed the dynamic of the relationship. For 3 years she has had unrestricted access to my phone, but it’s the fact that she snuck it while I slept, then framed me as a cheater that deserved it. 

One friend told me that they had gone through a similar thing, and after that, the relationship just never returned to baseline.

I've been trying to dial in my morning routine, so to speak. Since I switched to XR, it's been challenging to find the right order and timing of my morning food/pills. I feel like the XR isn't as effective for me, so I'm trying to play with my morning pacing of food/pills to see if maybe the pill is metabolized better on an empty stomach versus with food. I would love to hear what worked for you all while I dial this in. And, yes, I did talk to my doctor about this and she didn't really have much input. She only told me that the medication doesn't specify that it needs to be taken in any certain way (with/without food).

**Here is my morning routine:**

I have to take my Levothyroxine on an empty stomach with no food/drink, so that happens first always.

I wait my normal 30 minute waiting period after taking the Levo before having my morning coffee (2 cups while I awaken).

Recently, I've been waiting \~30 minutes until my last cup of coffee to take my adderrall.

After that, I wait another \~30 mintues to drink a protein shake. That's all I usually have for breakfast, sometimes I will also eat a banana depending on the day.

What I'm wondering is; is my coffee affecting the adderrall absorption? While I have seriously rolled back the amount of coffee I drink, I do still enoy a cup or two. Sometimes I'll just drink one cup of regular and another of decaf, it's also about the ritual and the feeling coffee gives me in the morning. Also, it helps me poop. :) I have read about vitamin C affecting efficacy, but I wasn't sure if the acid in coffee worked the same way.

I'd love to get some idea of what you all do and how your morning routines compare. Maybe I need to eat more than just a protein shake in the morning or give the coffee some more time to work through my system before I take the XR? Do you feel like it works better and lasts longer taking it after a meal?

Pycord is a modern Discord bot framework built in Python. As my first serious Python project, I created a Discord bot that helps join gamers from servers all over to connect & play games together. It simplifies the process of looking for group (LFG) for the top games.

**Target Audience**

This is a project I hope gamers use to connect to more people in order to play games together.

**Comparison**

All the current LFG bots I've seen either are decommissioned or simply do not work. Raid Event Organizer is the closest bot I could find with popularity.

The framework is super clean; I recommend it to anyone who wants to build a Discord bot. They have a super helpful support server and well maintained documentation.

I’ve heard it all—from “China is incredibly safe and efficient” to “Get ready for culture shock.” I’ve read stories about street food that changed lives, tech so advanced it makes the West look like the Stone Age, and toilets that… well, you know.

I’m not going as part of a tour group. No travel agency. Just me, my backpack, a loose itinerary, and a whole lot of curiosity. My plan is to document everything—every unexpected kindness, awkward encounter, surprising discovery, and (hopefully not) travel fail.

First stop: Shanghai. After that? Who knows. Chengdu, Xi’an, maybe some lesser-known places too. If you’ve been, tell me: what blew your mind? What should I absolutely not miss? What should I be prepared for?

I’ll be posting updates as I go—like a mini travel journal slash reality check of what it’s really like to explore China in 2025 as a solo traveler.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job and I travel a lot. I suppose it’s a good life, I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

### Background
I’m 42M, 6’1”/162 pounds, a former D1 collegiate runner (though a relative scrub on a national-champion team). I kept up running a few years after college, and ran my first marathon at Big Sur in 2007 (6th overall in 2:44, but the race was such a blur because I went out too fast and bonked so that I didn’t feel like I made the most of the experience). I stopped running much in 2010 when I got injured but couldn’t afford physical therapy. I had a few false starts over the years, but calf issues would crop up. In December 2023, I had what I like to think of as a “positive mid-life crisis” as I realized I wasn’t actually a runner anymore, and at 41 I  may never be one again unless I changed things, urgently! I committed myself to getting back into running shape, and within 12 weeks went from running 50 miles in all of 2023 to running 50+ miles a week… and promptly got a stress fracture in my foot. Maybe a bit too quick of a rampup! After that healed, I was a bit more careful and slowly started to build back my fitness and lose my extra weight in a long buildup to my hometown Baltimore Marathon in October 2024 (mostly following Pfitz 18/55 peaking in the 60’s mpw). I needed a lot of PT appointments for calf and hamstring issues, but made it to the startline. That race went fantastic, giving it my all to run 2:47. I signed up for another race to keep the psyche up, and chose Big Sur again to try to fully appreciate the Big Sur beauty in a way I missed in 2007.

### Training
After the Baltimore marathon, I had a nice base-building phase in the fall to get ready for a full Pfitz 18/70 cycle, which kicked off around Christmas. The first 5 weeks went great... until I suddenly became the sickest I have ever been in my life. I thought it was just a nasty cold until it got to the point where I could barely breathe, due to what turned out to be a massive clot of bacteria in my lungs (pneumonia). I’m sure it would have killed me in a few days if left alone—thank goodness for the invention of antibiotics! I had lost 12 pounds in 7 days (down to 150lb), was hacking up foul material for weeks, and my heart rate was through the roof when walking up the stairs. Basically, once cleared by my doctor torun again, I was starting back at fitness-square one with just 9 weeks to go to the race. The first weeks back of ~25mi felt way harder than any 60+ mpw weeks I’ve done. I purely focused on “easy” base running, but my heart rate would still quickly jump to LT rate or above! Over the next few weeks, I focused on building back up a long run and getting a bit of LT work (got in 4 long runs over 19mi with hills and pacework and worked my LT pace from 6:20 down to 5:50/mi) and peaked at 72mi 3 weeks before the race. I was also afflicted with, <ahem> “runner’s trot” issues from the antibiotics for the rest of the training cycle (and was very worried about how many pit-stops I might need during the race!). Overall, I still felt weaker than I had in mid-January, but felt strong enough to put in a good effort, whatever that pace may be. I set a goal of top 25 overall to give me something a little scary but possible to shoot for, especially since the racetimes are so dependent upon the conditions.

### Pre-race
My family flew to California the week before the race for Spring Break/grandparent time for the kids.Did my final tuneup workout at 5:45/mi pace and finally starting feeling like my old pre-sickness self. We went down to Monterey the day before the race, and my kids went to the aquarium with grandparents while I went to the expo and did a shakeout. Had an early dinner of sea-bass and risotto, and was asleep by 9pm. Woke up at 3am to scarf down a banana and bagel with PB&J and a Skratch labs high carb drink. Was dropped off at the bus at 4am and stared at the darkness as we traveled the disturbingly long way to the start line. I thought: “Am I really going to racing this whole way back?!?”. Had a Gu stroopwaffel and coffee at 5:30, a 5minute warmup jog in the rain, took a gu and lined up a couple rows back from the front of Corral A.
Race Outfit: Nike aeroswift singlet, Bandit Superbeam quartertights, alphafly 3’s.
Race Nutrition: gu 15min before start, 160g Maurten’s at 4.8mi and 12mi, and a 100g Maurten’s Caff at ~17mi. I grabbed a cup on Nuun’s drink mixture at every water stop. Didn’t bonk!

### Race
Since I had no real idea of my ultimate fitness, I went totally by feel through the ups and downs of the beautiful, wet, windy, hilly course! Started with 4 downhill in foggy redwoods, then cutting to the coast with a gentle uphill with a mighty headwind, quick downhill then a steep 2mile climb to hurricane point, Bixby Bridge, and many miles of rolling hills on the way to Carmel. Felt like I had Ireland’s pastoral hills on the right and Kauai’s sea cliffs on the left! Then rolling cambered hills by rich peoples’ homes in the Carmel Highlands, then on to the finish (though the last section was a bit of a blur to be honest). I started near the front of the field and tried to stay relaxed through the first downhill miles. In my 40’s, it takes longer for my heart rate to ramp up and to be able to handle faster paces, so I focused on being smooth (avoiding needless braking on the downhills) with controlled breathing.  Once warmed up and onto the flats and gentle uphills of miles 5-9, I upped the perceived effort into the headwind as we headed to the coast and pulled away from the runners nearby and was soon basically alone with a big gap ahead and behind (I was basically alone in the marathon from miles 7-23). I focused on keeping my heart rate under 160 on the hills to keep from burning myself out too early (like I had done in 2007). The 2 mile Hurricane Point climb itself wasn’t too bad, especially with a much gentler 2nd mile. I was well-prepared from my hilly long runs to handle Hurricane point; rather I saved all of my groans for the random hills thrown in all over the course that didn’t even seem to exist on the course map’s elevation profile. I came through the halfway point at 1:22-high and felt good ticking off the miles for a while, before the cumulative downhill pounding on the quads really started to set in. My left hamstring, right calf and especially left quad started to bark at me around miles 16-18, to where I preferred the uphills to the downhills the rest of the race! I knew the total elevation gain is ~+2100ft, so I tried to trick myself into relishing the uphills, since each step up was another foot of elevation chopped off the to-do list. On the other hand, every step downhill for the last 8 miles elicited a little “ow” from my quads, but stayed manageable as long as I reigned in the pace. For the last 10k of the race, I was definitely limited by how much pounding my legs could take versus my cardiovascular limit, with my heart rate dropping well below threshold. I simply tried to manage as fast as my legs themselves could take, and was pleasantly surprised that I was still clicking off low 6’s/mile (my grade-adjusted pace was ~6:10/mi for miles 18-23).
The 21-miler race started ahead of us on the same course, so I was constantly passing walkers and joggers, but couldn’t tell where any fellow marathon racers were. Evidently I passed a few in the last 10k without realizing it! At mile ~21, I recognized a fellow marathon runner up ahead, a 5-time winner here and a fellow competitor in the Master’s division, so I focused on reeling him in (he was looking like he was paying the price for a too-quick first-half). I slowly got closer, gobbling up the gap on uphills, while losing a bit on all the downhills.  I passed him on a hill around mile 23, without a fight, but then disaster struck half a mile later, when my left hamstring suddenly cramped up and stopped me dead in my tracks. The exact same muscle cramp, at the same distance as during the Baltimore marathon last fall! After about a minute and several attempts to get it stretched out, it finally released enough to get running again, though my competition had re-passed me in the meantime. Surprisingly, the hamstring felt almost-normal again by mile 24, and I could resume racing after my competition. I briefly passed him again around mile 25, but this time he was properly in on the fight and he flew by me again on the downhill, and held the lead to the final straight. I cashed in all my remaining reserves to kick hard and sprinted past him to take the master’s crown, and 4th place overall. Official time of 2:44:44, slight negative split, and tantalizingly close to the 2:44:28 I ran here as a much younger man in 2007! More importantly, I kept my head up and enjoyed the race much more than in my youth. The course was tough, but as slow as I would have thought, I could have managed maybe 5min faster on a flat, windless course. The wind and uphills were manageable, but what really cost me was the pounding downhill, especially needing to use my quads to brake a bit to maintain control on the wet, cambered roads while weaving between walkers in wobbly alphaflys (with a popped air pod to boot).

### Post-race
After the race, I high-fived my family and waddled over to the tent to collect my gear and get into warmer clothes, enjoying the runner’s high of a race well-executed. The race organizers did an amazing job all weekend, best-organized race I’ve ever done, highly recommend it for anybody’s race bucket list. I forced myself to eat a bit of food, enjoyed a beer, and soaked up the vibes until the award ceremony kicked off. I ended up with 3 award plaques, for overall place, winning my 40-44 age group, and winning the overall Master’s category (40+). I followed another dad’s example and brought up my kids with me on stage for my awards—there was a very wholesome r/daddit crossover with us 3,4,5th place finishers all with our little kids, who were beyond pumped to be in front of a crowd! My quads and hamstrings are still super-fried as I type this on the airplane, and I have to steel myself when I’m confronted with a staircase, but I’m relishing that too as a sign of mischief-well-managed! Considering how bleak things looked 9 weeks ago, I’m deliriously happy with how my body rebounded and how the race progressed. My mini mid-life crisis last year has transformed my body and attitude, and helped me recapture my love of running.  Now I need to make up for lost time while I still can and get in a few proper pneumonia-free training cycles to carry me to Boston 26 and beyond!

We matched on Hinge and it was going all right — not fantastic, but all right. Date one was a low-key coffee shop date, she seemed nice. I wouldn't say there was electricity in the air or anything, but I was hopeful. She mentioned that she liked trains, which I interpreted as a good thing (I'm seriously into transit and locomotives — I build HO scale sets and have a pretty big layout that takes up most of my living room, not boasting).

So, on the second date, we went out to a Thai place. We're conversing, everything's fine, then she says, ""Your phone buzzed — is that your wallpaper?"" and laughs.

Here's the thing: my wallpaper is a composite AI-generated image of a woman who kind of looks like a mix between Margot Robbie and an Thomas the train character, but with a diaper that has green stink lines. I made it myself on Midjourney. She's wearing a conductor's hat and standing in front of a Deutsche Bahn Class 103 train. To me, it's a beautiful image — it brings together a few of my favorite things in one. It's not that weird.

She just responds, ""Wow, okay, didn't expect that,"" and then she laughs again. It wasn't even a laugh, more of a judgy chuckle. I respond with something idiotic like, ""She's my future wife,"" and she just gives me ""Interesting taste,"" then goes back to eating.

But the rest of the date afterwards wasn't quite right. She kept looking at her phone. Didn't even finish eating her curry. She didn't even comment on the train socks I wore specially because she said she liked trains.

I walked her out to her car and she just gave me this half-hearted ""Thanks for dinner"" and then took off. She hasn't texted me since. That was 16 hours ago.

I just can't stop thinking about the moment. Why did she laugh? Why did it matter? It's just a wallpaper. People assign babies or sports teams or sunsets. I speak through digital art and yes, maybe the woman is a bit overdone, but it's not sexual. It's aesthetic. People don't get that some of us actually enjoy form and machinery.

Now I’m spiraling. Like, is this why nothing ever works out? I try to be myself and people just see it as weird. I’m polite, I paid for the meal, I opened the door for her, I even picked a restaurant with zero television screens so we could talk. But one image on my lockscreen and suddenly I’m some creep?

I know this may sound silly and dumb but it's really pissing me off. Am I overreacting for feeling completely judged and dismissed for something so trivial? Or was she superficial and looking for an excuse to dismiss me?

Ever felt like you’re treading water in a sea of goals and dreams? You know the feeling— your to-do list is a mile long, yet you’re stuck scrolling through social media or staring blankly at your screen. Welcome to **Achievement Paralysis**! 🤦‍♂️ Been there, done that!

So what’s the secret sauce to breaking out of this funk? I’ve got a little trick up my sleeve that takes just **five minutes**: the **""Pre-Mortem"" Technique.** Sounds fancy, right? But it’s as approachable as your morning coffee ☕.

### What the Heck is a Pre-Mortem? 🤔
Imagine you’re a detective solving the mystery of why you haven't achieved that goal. Instead of waiting until the end to see what went wrong, you flip the script. You *pretend* the project has failed and ask yourself, “What went wrong?” This little mental exercise can help you dodge pitfalls before they even happen.

### Here’s how to do it in just 5 minutes:

1. **Set the Scene**  
   Picture yourself six months from now. You’ve worked on your goal, but things didn’t pan out. What went wrong? Write down all the possible reasons.

2. **Be Honest**  
   Don’t hold back! Maybe you got distracted, lacked resources, or even didn’t put in enough effort. No judgment here—just the truth! 🙈

3. **Create Solutions**  
   For each reason you’ve listed, jot down a *counter-strategy.* For example:
   - **Procrastination?** Schedule your task like an important meeting.
   - **Lack of resources?** List out what you need and plan to get it!

4. **Prioritize**  
   Now that you’ve mapped out the obstacles and solutions, pick the top three to tackle first. Keep it manageable! 🎯

5. **Take Action**  
   The goal isn’t perfection, just progress. Sometimes getting started is the hardest part, but once you do, the momentum is *chef’s kiss.* 👨‍🍳✨

### Why This Works:
- **Shift in Perspective**: By imagining failure, you prepare for challenges without the fear that often holds you back.
- **Clarity**: You get a clearer picture of what you want and what risks are involved.
- **Empowerment**: Instead of feeling stuck, you’re taking control! That’s power, right?

I recently tried this out while working on a personal project. I listed all the things that might go wrong (hello, self-doubt!), but by addressing them head-on, I felt invigorated to move forward. It’s like shedding a weight off your shoulders!

So, what do you think? Have you ever experienced achievement paralysis? How do you usually break through it? I’d love to hear your own tricks or stories! 🚀",1,1746584137.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
