1noigio,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1noigio,Looking for advice on Diedrich IR-3N,"I am new to roasting (coffee, really) and have never roasted a bean.  However, I have fallen off the deep end and have jumped in with both feet.  I have decided that I want to get a roaster and am wanting a 3-7 kg machine from SF, Giesen, or Diedrich.  I am hoping to create a side hustle that can turn into something big, but before I buy a 12 Kilo, I would like to prove out the potential in my area.

This one has popped up, and I am somewhat interested.  It would not be convenient to get, as it is on the smaller side of what I am looking to get, would need to be converted to LP, and I think it's priced a little higher than I would prefer to pay for this particular one (meaning I don't think it's a screaming deal to offset the other shortcomings).

Due to my lack of knowledge, what can I confirm or ask before making the trip?  It is about 1000 miles away.

Choosing the best coffee maker can be a daunting task, especially with so many options available. A good coffee maker is not just about brewing a great cup of coffee. It’s also about providing a positive user experience. This includes how easy it is to use, maintain, and how long it lasts. Understanding these aspects can help you make a more informed decision. Let’s delve into these factors to find the perfect coffee maker for your needs.

# Ease Of Use

Finding a coffee maker that’s easy to use is crucial. A simple interface can make your coffee-making process more enjoyable. Look for coffee makers with clear instructions and intuitive controls.

# Taste Preferences

Choosing the best coffee maker can be a daunting task with so many options available. Understanding your **taste preferences**is crucial to finding a machine that suits your needs. Whether you love a strong brew or a milder cup, the right coffee maker can make all the difference. This guide will help you explore the key factors in selecting a coffee maker that aligns with your taste buds.

# Coffee Strength

Different coffee makers produce different strength levels in coffee. The strength of your coffee is determined by the **brewing process**and the type of machine used. For those who prefer a **bold and intense flavor**, a French press or espresso machine might be ideal. These machines allow for longer brewing times and a higher coffee-to-water ratio.

* **French Press:**Offers a strong, rich flavor by steeping coffee grounds.
* **Espresso Machine:**Brews concentrated coffee with a robust taste.

For a lighter brew, consider a drip coffee maker. It uses a slower brewing process, which results in a milder taste. The choice of coffee maker greatly influences the **strength and taste**of your coffee, so select one that matches your preference.

# Flavor Profiles

Coffee makers can affect the flavor profile of your brew. Each type can enhance or diminish certain flavor notes. A drip coffee maker might highlight the **nutty and chocolatey**flavors, making it a good choice for those who enjoy such notes.

Espresso machines, on the other hand, are perfect for those who love a **rich and full-bodied**experience. They can bring out the complex flavors of the coffee beans.

|Machine Type|Flavor Profile|
|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee Maker|Nutty, Chocolatey|
|Espresso Machine|Rich, Full-bodied|

Understanding these flavor profiles can help you choose a coffee maker that enhances the specific flavors you enjoy.

# Freshness Factors

Freshness plays a crucial role in the taste of your coffee. A good coffee maker should preserve the **freshness of the beans**to enhance the flavor. Some machines come with built-in grinders, which grind the beans just before brewing. This ensures maximum freshness.

Consider a coffee maker with an airtight container for storing coffee grounds. This helps in keeping the coffee fresh for longer periods.

* **Built-in Grinders:**Provides freshly ground coffee for each brew.
* **Airtight Containers:**Maintains the freshness of the coffee grounds.

Paying attention to these **freshness factors**can significantly improve your coffee’s taste and aroma, resulting in a more enjoyable cup every time.

# Where To Buy

Choosing the best coffee maker can be a daunting task. With so many options available, it’s crucial to know where to buy. The right place can make a big difference in your purchase. The key is understanding the pros and cons of each buying option. In this guide, we’ll explore online retailers, local stores, and second-hand options. Each of these has its unique benefits and drawbacks. Understanding these can help you make an informed decision.

# Online Retailers

* Convenience: Shop from the comfort of your home.
* Variety: Access to numerous brands and models.
* Reviews: Read customer feedback to make better decisions.

Delivery times can vary, so plan ahead if you need the coffee maker quickly. Overall, online shopping is great for those who want options and convenience.

# Local Stores

Local stores provide a different shopping experience. Visiting a store allows you to see and touch the product. This hands-on approach is beneficial for many buyers. Some advantages of local stores include:

* Immediate Purchase: Take the coffee maker home the same day.
* Personal Assistance: Get help from store staff.

Yet, local stores might have limited stock. Prices could be higher compared to online options. It’s important to visit multiple stores to find the best deal. Local stores are ideal for those who prefer a personal touch and immediate purchase.

Second-hand options can save money. Used coffee makers are often cheaper than new ones. Places like thrift stores, garage sales, and online marketplaces offer used items. Consider these points:

* Cost Savings: Often, second-hand items are much cheaper.
* Sustainability: Buying used is eco-friendly.
* Unique Finds: Discover rare or vintage coffee makers.

1noier0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaDivine/comments/1noier0/meaning_of_human_civilization/,meaning of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My dilemma is… I love the machine - do i try:

A) take it apart and put the outer body components on a uk machine, risk breaking it or causing damage to it or me

B) leave it alone and keep it as a display/collectors item (and just buy a uk machine so I can actually have my samra origins coffee pods cause the coffee is yum)

C) eBay it and just buy a normal one without the cute green design (i hate this option) 


I’m honestly so torn! I know these machines have lifespans and reviews say the vertuo pop+ does die after 5/10 years so would I be wasting my efforts if I go with option a.

This is just what Jesus is waiting to do in your life - sit beside you and chat.

Prayer so often looks like dialing heaven, waiting for God to answer in some far off territority that is unknown to you, and then speaking a few words that you hope he deems worthy of listening to. Then, you hang up. You never wait for his reply.

What a terrible relationship\~ Can you imagine calling your friend, mother or father and simply stating a few words, and just when they are ready to respond, you hang up\~

That is so far from the truth of talking to a our Heavenly Father.

In my daily, I speak to Christ as if he were seated right beside me. He listens gently and I wait for his reply. It is a beautiful exchange that I long to have many times a day.

If you are ready to sit with him and listen, book a session with me today. He is waiting to answer you.

1noidwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1noidwu/crazy_inconsistency_with_grinding_and_extraction/,Crazy inconsistency with grinding and extraction,"Hey all! Got my black 601UK last week, and while I'm already aware of the issues with extraction volumes I was not prepared for the behaviour of my machine o.O I can't quite figure out what's going on here but here is my progression:

1st espresso - BA started at 18 / strength 2 - Got tiny DRIPS of coffee through, BA suggested 20

2 - Tried 18 again in case something went wrong because I expected to go way down in grind setting: same result.

3 - Grind 20 / strength 2 - better volume but I didn't measure yet, seemed very large - BA suggests 21

4 - Grind 21 / strength 2 - similar to shot 3 - BA stays at 21

5 - Grind 20 / strength 2- get 55ish grams - BA stays at 21 from here on

6 - Grind 18 / strength 3 - get 55ish grams

7 - Grind 16 / strength 3 - get DRIPS of coffee through (5g) and have to extract twice (yeah I know but I didn't wanna waste the beans), the 2nd extraction comes out better volume wise but still over 50g

8 - Grind 17 / strength 3 - get drips same as above (4/5g)

I'm not an espresso drinker, I do milk drinks but every shot I tasted seemed very bitter to me. Using CoffeeWorks Dark chocolate and Hazelnut Brazil.

Now aside from the wild inconsistency of 18 strength 2 getting drips and 18 strength 3 getting 55 grams, I'm worried pulling espresso so high in the grind range means that it won't be grinding coarse enough when it comes to doing the filter coffees and cold brews which I've seen usually go straight to 25 with others machines. I'd expect double espresso to be somewhere in the single digits to low double digits, not 20.

I'm also getting inconsistency with the milk frothing too. Thin froth will often make very bubbly froth and thin milk. Steamed milk option just screeches uncontrollably until I terminate it. Today, thin froth was perfect: nice steamed milk and small amount of dense, not bubbly foam.

At first I thought maybe the grinder was shimmed too high (I have not opened it up yet) but this doesn't explain the massive difference between similar or even identical grind settings, or the inconsistent milk.

Does anyone have any insights before I just try asking Ninja and potentially swapping the machine? (which is now sold out lol)

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I picked up coffee for someone and decided to get one for myself. I ordered a decaf latte with coconut milk which means cross contamination due to the machines. I don’t know why it didn’t occur to me that I couldn’t have a latte but now my poor sweet babe is paying the price. We are 3 weeks into dairy and soy free and she became a whole new baby. Now she’s back to inconsolable, extra wiggly and reluctant to feed. 

Since it’s the first time I’ve backslid with her, I was wondering what to expect in terms of duration of symptoms? It’s been 24 hours since I ingested it so my breastmilk should be clear but how long will she feel it? Can we do anything to alleviate her pain?

1noi7aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaRises/comments/1noi7aw/whats_aim_of_lyfe/,what's aim of lyfe,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1758636058.0,IndiaRises,1,1.0,False

What does this mean for you? If you run an ecommerce website and want to sell products and services to people that are on the OpenAI, Gemini and Claude agent hypetrain then you will want to keep this on your radar.
They say it can be used with Google’s Agent2Agent Protocol which allows their agents to talk to your agents or MCP. 
I still think A2A might be computational inefficient and a great way to burn a lot of money on expensive LLM models but I am keeping an open mind.
How are you preparing to market and sell your product/service in this new era of AI Agents?

I am a highly anxious guy who second guesses nearly everything from crushes to plain friendships.

So there’s this girl: pretty socially awkward, kinda shy and quiet, but so sweet and incredibly cute like you wouldn’t believe and if you don’t believe me then you’re wrong. We’re in college. There’s a pretty long history between me and her, and I suspected her having feelings for me about a year ago, but things didn’t line up the way I needed them to. Right around the time this semester started, I reached out to her on Insta and said I’d really like to see her sometime, and that there was no rush. It took a few days, but she replied with a yes, and we set up meetings once a week! Because of clubs/classes/homework and whatnot, it’s only a couple hours but she was the first one to say it would be a regular thing we do. We’ve been doing it for about a month. At the last one, she bought me coffee and stopped me from trying to save her money because she wanted me to enjoy it. If I buy her food, she has to “make it even,” but when she does it for me she tells me I don’t have to make it even.

She smiles a whole bunch, remembers small things, asks about my personal life while opening up about hers, and she even invited me to her place on the weekend to watch sports and I stayed for six hours. She kept me fed, wanted to make sure I was comfortable, and we sat with our shoulders and knees touching and she didn’t inch away. She also said she was down to do it again when it was all done.

The only problem… she’s not a top ten texter. She’s got an incredibly hard major, usually has multiple things due each day of the week, and has both a TA and volunteer position in a lab (it’s so cool). When she does reply, she’s engaging and not *dry*, but it takes her long enough that it gets me scared, y’know? That, and she shares information where I can’t tell if she’s just trying to be as open as possible with me (which is so cute) or if she just doesn’t see me that way so she’s okay talking about it. 

Please help 😭😭😭 I really have a good feeling about this girl and I hope it’s not just her being super duper friendly",1,1758635945.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

1noi4bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1noi4bi/i_f34_dumped_my_friendsituationship_m31_and/,I (F34) dumped my “friend”/“situationship” (M31) and ruined his birthday plans.,"Me (34F) and this guy (31M) met 10 years ago in college. We shared a group of friends, he always liked me but we never actually engaged one-on-one. He'd follow me online during all this time. Eventually he got married, had a child, and I moved to another city.

In 2022 we reconnected online. He was in an open marriage at the time, and wanted to meet for drinks/sex, we flirted daily but I did not meet him because I lived far away and it was not feasible to travel just to see him. In 2023, due to work, I moved to the city he lived in and we had a date. Nothing serious, just talking at my place and had a few laughs. He ghosted me afterwards and I was a bit bummed, but didn't care much. We shared some friends in common, and I've heard from his friends that he actually closed off his marriage and did not have guts to tell me, but wanted to apologize.

Somehow, we ended up working together on a project and he apologized for his behavior. He said he really liked me and asked if we could be friends. He really pushed for it. I did not have strong feelings against him, so I forgave him and we'd meet for coffee almost weekly and we became really close friends. Couple months later, he forgot my birthday, despite the fact that I told him about it two days before, and that I wanted to celebrate with my friends.  We had an argument over it, and he stopped talking to me. I shrugged it off and moved on with my life.

2025, guess who comes back? He says he misses me, and wants to reconnect. I give him yet another chance. His marriage is open again. He finally talks about his feelings, that he did not want to ruin our friendship back in the day but he feels something for me. We finally have sex and it's good. We keep having sex for two months, and meeting weekly to talk, watch movies.

Abruptly he got divorced (it was not for me, but for other reasons) and then everything changed.  I didn't push him for a romantic relationship because I knew he wasn't ready, and I offered my support and friendship to him during the divorce. He invited me to a trip overseas, saying that now that he was single, he wanted to enjoy life and do things he never did before (i.e. traveling with someone he liked overseas). I accepted it and we made plans, he bought the plane tickets, etc.

Then, he started being a jerk.

One day, he invited me for a game night, said he'd drop his kid by his ex and come to my place. Around 8PM he told me he couldn't make it because his ex wouldn't be able to spend the night with his kid.  I found out he did in fact dropped his kid by his ex and lied to me about it. I was very upset and confronted him on the lie. He apologized profusely, said he was just tired and did't have the nerve to cancel our plans. I wanted to stop our ""friendship"" right there, but he asked for another chance. I rationalized he was still messed up due to the divorce, so I gave him.

After this incident, I couldn't trust him anymore and stopped having sex. He tried to be more present, would text every day, we'd meet every week for drinks/board games at my place, but no sex was involved. He even said once that he didn't know exactly what he was looking for in our relationship, because hanging out with me was ""random"" and sometimes there was sex, sometimes there was not. I let this comment slide and tried to believe it was just the musings of a confused man and not a complaint.

Last month,  he invited me to his parents' house (where he's living with his kid) so we could talk and drink some wine. We were having a great time and suddenly his daughter woke up and he panicked. He asked me to hide in the bedroom, and then to leave because his daughter wouldn't sleep and she couldn't see me there. I was perplexed by his reaction, because we were literally just talking and drinking wine. He apologized but said his daughter would tell his ex/his parents that he had ""a woman"" in the house and that could not happen. I felt humiliated and left. He blowed up my phone afterwards apologizing and hoping I'd understand.

I couldn't deal with all of this bs anymore, and after a few days of arguments and apologies, I decided to end our ""friendship"". He was very dramatic, that he “really liked me” but I didn’t believe him. That he was sleeping around with other girls, but they did not matter at all to him, they were just ""meaningless flings"", and I was his only friend and the only one he trusted. Tried to rewrite history saying he stopped having sex with me and pushed for a friendship because he's not ready for a romantic relationship with anyone after the divorce, but as a friend he can come through, and that he wants to come through for me. That he did not want to lose me yada yada.

I was BAFFLED by this guy ""friend zoning"" me when I did not ask for any relationship whatsoever (we did not even had the ""what are we"" talk), when he spent months having sex with me, when he invited me to a trip overseas, when he'd drop by my place every week and talk to me every single day. I lost it and told him that what he called friendship was emotional parasitism, that he was a terrible person and I regret giving him so many chances, gave back his stuff that he left at my place, and that he could go on the trip alone.

He had bought the plane tickets, I told him I'd pay for mine, and even offered my concert ticket to him so he could take someone else. He refused, said ""screw the money, I don't give a fuck"". I told him not to contact me anymore  and we unfollowed each other on social media. 

A couple weeks later, I’m not sad about leaving this dumpster fire of a “relationship” but I do feel remorse for being so cold and cruel in the end. I don’t know if I should reach out to make things right or if I should just leave it be.

My son is almost 6 months old

My son's first wake window is frankly miserable and I am on the edge. 2 days in a row I have been so overstimulated and upset that iv had to sit him in the crib crying and walk away for a couple minutes which makes me feel awful

He wakes up and I get maybe 15 minutes of him being reasonable, smiling, etc. during this time I am SPEED trying to get myself at least a coffee and a pop tart or something

Because almost immediately he starts the whining and needyness. I have to sit with him and play but he's getting more and more agitated and it's more delaying the inevitable. We try to move to sit outside on the blanket, different activities, but he's not ever really laughing and happy just delaying the true meltdown

Eventually the last full hour of the wake window he is thrashing, upset, and can only be soothed by me power walking, outside, holding him world facing. For WAY too long. If I go inside to try to make him go to sleep he tries, fails, and then just scream cries. So I'm attempting this repeatedly, then going back outside, then trying again to offer a toy, then trying sleep again, anything. Nothing works

He absolutely will not go to sleep until it's been 2.5 hours of awake time. Sometimes more at random. But that's the FLOOR time it will take even though he's tired and angry long before it. I can tell he's tired, angry, and agitated but he won't go the fuck to sleep for that first nap

It's really killing me. I feel like I start the day sweaty, angry, and in ""fight mode"" every single day. I don't get to eat breakfast or even happy play with him as he's pretty much just mad the whole time culminating in a meltdown.

As soon as he has that first nap whether it's 30 minutes or 1 hr 30 minutes he's a new baby. And the rest of the day goes much better and he's generally easy to put down for all subsequent naps and bedtime. Relatively at least. I can wait for his tired cues, rock him, and put him to sleep. Nothing is as bad as this first window. Even ""witching hour"" if he's just grumpy I have certain toys and little games he likes and I can get him to crack a smile and be happy. Or movement games like lifting him up, any of that works at any other time of day. He's just SO upset all morning

It ruins my entire day starting off like this. I wake up and I am anxious now too about what's about to happen. I feel like a crazy person because everyone tells me they are nicest in the morning and that's when they get shit done like folding laundry

Has this happened to anyone else??? Does it get better??? 

I feel like I have tried everything including trying to put him back to bed sooner. Goes to sleep around 8pm and wakes up at 6:30ish. If I make bedtime earlier like 7pm he just wakes up at 5:30 and can't be resettled. His naps are generally 2.5-3 hours total. I feel like he needs more sleep but he can't stay asleep long enough ",2,1758635853.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

he starts chatting with some CFIs about his ""type rating"" and how he flies the 737 for a major airline. everyone's impressed, asking him questions about airline life and all that. then he mentions he's here to rent a 172 for some pattern work to stay current



here's where it gets weird... the desk person asks for his certificate and medical. this dude pulls out a STUDENT PILOT certificate. not even PPL. student. 



the whole room just went silent. one of the CFIs was like ""wait... you said you fly 737s?"" and the guy just doubles down, starts explaining how he's been ""training on the simulator"" and his airline is ""fast tracking"" him or something but he needs to log actual flight hours



the FBO manager had to escort him out after he tried arguing that his ""simulator hours"" should count as PIC time and demanded they rent him the plane anyway. he kept insisting we didn't understand how ""european training programs work"" even though this is literally in Ohio



has anyone else seen anything like this?? are there people out there really cosplaying as airline pilots at FBOs? the uniform looked so legit too, like where do you even BUY that if you're not actually employed by an airline",16,1758635803.0,flightsim,6,0.9,False

This is a concept I want to explore more in the future!

Any feed back is good feed back! I struggle with conversations.



Daniel Marris cupped his mug between cold, tired hands. The faint warmth from the cup was a whisper against the chill. He never meant to feel like this, so insensate, so small.

Ashbridge wasn’t the kind of college town that welcomed people like him. Not with its sleek buildings, gene-printed students, and families boasting generational wealth. Daniel came from the edge of industry, a place of worn-out boots, broken heaters, and dinners stretched with boxed rice. His mom hadn’t worked since the accident that mangled her back. His dad worked double shifts on scaffolds. Daniel’s acceptance into Ashbridge’s engineering program had been a glimmer of hope, but it came with a cost.

*The Sensory Cost.*

He thought back to speaking with student services. “You can pay with cash, with time, or you can pay with a sense.” A brutal and excruciating practice, born out of the student debt crisis that left half a generation bankrupt. Now, students from working- and middle-class backgrounds could pay for college with their senses, losing a sense either all at once or in scheduled increments.

Most students gave up their sense of taste, a way to save money and avoid the freshman fifteen. A few brave souls surrendered their hearing or sight.

Daniel chose touch.

He reasoned it would be the least disruptive to his mechanical engineering degree. He could still read off the board, listen to lectures, and enjoy the free food at campus events. Unfortunately, the impact of this decision was far greater than he expected.

By the end of the fall semester of his sophomore year, Daniel had already surrendered over 40% of his tactile input. He could still type, still write, but the sensation of pen on paper felt like scribbling on air. He noticed it most in the cold: the numbness in his fingers didn’t sting. Ashbridge winters were sharp and bitter, but to Daniel, this winter arrived like a ghost.

Daniel sat at his dorm desk, sipping coffee that tasted bitter and metallic. To him, it felt lukewarm despite the visible steam. He tried not to think about the sensation he was missing. He couldn’t think about it, the thought only fed the ever-growing dread in his stomach. Sitting before him, on the coffee-ring-stained desk, there was another payment notice.

“SEMESTER PAYMENT DUE: Failure to remit may result in administrative lockout.”

This payment would require another 30% of his remaining touch, enough to dull nearly everything but the sharpest pain.

Daniel stood shakily. He struggled to steady himself between his dread and the fuzzy, nearly numb feeling in his feet. The sensation, or lack thereof, was like a crawling numbness, a fizzing static. Daniel had grown accustomed to the hollow tingling his body now felt. As he exited his dorm, he remembered to grab his jacket. Even if he couldn’t feel the cold of winter, the cold could still bite him.

As he walked to the payment clinic, he found himself thinking of the children he used to hear about on his mother’s daytime television shows; children born without the ability to feel. Congenital analgesia: the inability to feel pain. Most kids with this syndrome died within their first three years. A few reached their early to mid-twenties. Daniel planned to graduate in two and a half years. If he couldn’t pony up the money for his junior year, he would be left without any sense of touch. He wouldn’t be able to feel any pain. The dread in his stomach jerked at the thought of surviving nearly two years without touch or pain at all.

As Daniel approached the steps of the payment clinic, he shook his head, trying to physically shake the idea from his mind. The payment clinic was a nondescript building on the edge of campus. To a passerby, there would be no way to guess that young students were sacrificing their senses, their connections to the world, in an effort for a better future. Inside was clinical and sterile; Daniel noted the intense scent of alcohol and disinfectant as he stepped through the glass doors.

“You still have options,” the blonde-haired clerk said flatly, without looking up from her terminal. “We can schedule the extraction for tomorrow or next week. If you wish to defer with loans, you’ll need co-signers. Parents?”

Daniel shook his head. “No. I… my dad already works two jobs. Mom can’t.”

“Then I’d recommend scheduling the payment.”

Daniel scheduled his appointment for tomorrow, ignoring the dread now gnawing at his insides. As he turned to leave, he overheard two students whispering near the doors.

“She can barely function,” snickered a tall, tan girl, whom Daniel recognized from his Human-Machine Ergonomics class.

“She basically has no senses since her last payment. You would think she’d have gotten a job by now,” said the other girl, slightly shorter with an olive complexion, mockingly.

“Maybe she wants to be one of those,” the first girl paused, making a face of disgust, “inactives.” Both girls snickered.

As Daniel passed them, he kept his eyes lowered. He didn’t want to be noticed, not here of all places.

*Inactives*, he thought, his dread deepening. The word clung to him like frost on the world around him. Inactives, or inactive citizens, were individuals who lost all their senses and were deemed devoid of any fiscal utility.

He knew who those girls were talking about. It was hard not to. Mara, a once beautiful and lithe girl Daniel met during freshman orientation. At the time, she’d left him flustered with her brilliant smile and bubbly personality. Now she was the personification of the grim consequences Daniel dreaded. He wasn’t sure whether it was out of morbid curiosity or genuine concern that he wanted to see her.

He found Mara on the campus fringe, hunched beside her car, the engine long dead and windows fogged from nights of breath. She was crouched on thin, trembling legs, reaching for a half-drank bottle of water that lay just out of reach under her car.

Daniel approached her, heart pounding in his ears but not in his chest. He didn’t know what to say.

“I got it,” he said, raising his voice as much as he could. Mara jumped, clearly unaware she had been approached. Daniel lowered himself prone onto the rough, cold asphalt, which registered little to him. He grabbed the bottle of water, accidentally denting it with the force of his grasp.

He stood carefully, making sure not to stumble or waver in public.

“Here.” He handed her the bottle slowly enough for her to register its presence.

Mara blinked slowly, her green eyes struggling to find his. She was ghostlike and thin. She grasped the cold bottle as best as she could.

“Thanks,” she said cautiously, taking a step back.

“I—It’s Daniel, Daniel Marris, from freshman orientation,” he said nervously in a loud voice.

Mara took a moment to process his words.

“It’s been a while.” She laughed nervously. Daniel went through the motions of small talk. He desperately didn’t want to acknowledge her current state. But as they spoke, a morbid need to understand welled up inside him. As their simple pleasantries began to end, without thinking, Daniel blurted, “What happened?” He realized how rude he sounded, but his dread controlled his tongue. “I mean… how did it get this bad?”

Mara gave a weak smile; her voice was flat.

“My dad lost his job right before the start of freshman year. I couldn’t afford tuition.” She inhaled sharply, fighting tears. “I started with taste. Figured I wouldn’t miss it much. Then I gave up touch, it didn’t seem important at the time.” This statement stung Daniel. “After that, smell. Then bit by bit my sight.”

Daniel’s throat tightened. “And your hearing?”

“Still have most of it,” she said, glancing toward the overcast sky. Daniel was unsure of how much she could really take in of it. Mara continues, “I can’t drive anymore. Can’t keep up in lectures. No one’s gonna hire me like this.”

Daniel looked down guiltily. She was a mirror of his fears. Mara reached into her coat and pulled out a small object: a worry stone, verdant and speckled with golds and browns, smooth except for a deep thumb-groove worn through use.

“I want to give you this.” She placed it in his hand. Her fingers didn’t twitch. “I don’t need it anymore.”

Daniel looked down at the stone in his palm. It was still warm from her hand, or at least he thought it was. Maybe he just remembered what warmth used to feel like. He didn’t want to tell her he could barely feel its cool, silken curve, no more than a ghost in his hand.

“Thanks,” he said, voice low.

Mara nodded once. “I use it to remind myself I’m still here.”

Daniel looked down at the smooth stone, turning it slowly in his palm. “It’s... nice. Thank you.” He kicked himself internally for being so awkward. He already had a hard enough time talking to girls, but he was ill-equipped to say anything more meaningful to her.

Mara’s gaze drifted toward her car, empty and quiet.

“I need to sleep,” she murmured. “The back seat stays warm enough, most nights.”

She turned without waiting for a reply and opened the driver’s side door. With a slow, practiced motion, she crawled into the back, curled up like a shadow folding into itself. The door shut with a soft click.

Daniel stood on the curb, half relieved the conversation was over, the stone in his hand cooling fast in the fading afternoon light.

That night, as Daniel walked home through silent streets dusted with ice, he ran his fingers over the stone, hoping to glean the feeling of Mara’s touch through it.

That night, Daniel stared at the ceiling above his bed. His dread growing, aching his stomach. The thought of Mara haunted him, feeding his dread larger. The memory of touch surfaced like a whisper. He thought of not feeling his mother’s hugs, nor the warmth of coffee cutting through cold mornings, and not being able to recreate the thrill of skin-on-skin contact that he had experienced during his first time the summer after high school.

He tried bargaining with his own mind: Just finish the degree. Get a job. Pay to restore the nerves.

But he’d read the fine print. Reversals were inconsistent. Sometimes nerves didn’t reactivate. Sometimes sensation came back wrong, pain where there should be pleasure. Sometimes nothing returned at all.

He squeezed the worry stone until his knuckles whitened. He could still feel it. Faintly. He didn’t know if that was comforting or horrifying.

The next morning, the day of payment, had arrived.

The dread inside him thrashed him awake.

On his way to the payment clinic, he took the long way to see Mara. She was gone. Her car sat on the curb, empty and frosted over. The dread clawed at Daniel’s insides.

It wasn’t until he had walked through the glass doors of the payment clinic that he realized he had forgotten his jacket. The cold bit him, but he perceived it as barely a chill. Daniel only saw his hands, red, their protests against the cold going unnoticed.

Daniel sat in the waiting room, surrounded by other students with blank faces and nervous postures. No one spoke. He rubbed the worry stone. Its surface was familiar now. His thumb traced the groove obsessively.

They called his name. “Marris, Daniel.”

The procedure room was white. Clean. Inhuman. He sat down. The technician didn’t speak. The procedure lasted only a few minutes.

Then came the numbness.

Outside, the world looked the same.

But the air felt distant. The cold, unimportant.

Daniel gripped the worry stone again.

Nothing.

He stared at it, a deep and vibrant green, like her eyes. Turned it in his hand. No texture. No warmth.

He stood there on the payment clinic’s steps, watching the stone like it might speak, like it might cry out.

But it was silent.

Daniel didn’t cry. He didn’t scream.

The dread that had lived in his stomach was now the only thing he could feel.",1,1758635668.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I'm open to making friends from the US, as long as you're kind, respectful, and looking for genuine connections. If you're feeling the same way, feel free to say hello—I'd love to hear from you.",1,1758635607.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False
1noi0f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/demonhatstories/comments/1noi0f3/chapter_12_the_days_of_sue/,Chapter 12: The Days of Sue,"Elisabeth stared at the contents of the box that she picked up on her way back from the deposit box. The sterile perfection of it: two pristine IV bags, their liquid glowing faintly under the bathroom light… seven empty vials, neatly clipped, like bullets in a magazine.

Her reflection in the mirror hovered just above them with tired eyes, chapped lips, the faint pink scar running down her spine visible beneath the collar of her robe.

She ran her fingers over the plastic tubing, almost tenderly, as if reacquainting herself with an old enemy.

Then her eyes flicked downward to Sue's body, frozen in its immaculate youth. The silence around her was suffocating.

She then set the vials carefully on the sink, and aligned them in a neat row, but her hands trembled slightly.

For a beat, Elisabeth did nothing. She just stood there between the light above, her reflection, and Sue's shadow below. The buzz of the fluorescent bulb grew louder… almost unbearable.

From outside, through the frosted glass of her apartment, her silhouette was bending over, preparing the ritual once more. A faint orange glow filling the window as it pulsed.

She put them away in the bathroom cabinet and closed the mirrored door where she saw her reflection staring back at her. She looked at Sue lying on the floor. And the IV bag indicating that there was still 4 more days to go...

Elisabeth sat hunched over the kitchen table, the tip of her pen carving black X's into the flimsy paper of the calendar. One week erased in a single streak. Then another. Seven days at a time, she obliterated them with the same sharp, mechanical slashes.

When she ran out of days, she wrote the same word again and again in their empty boxes: **SUE.** Her name filled the grid like a chant, like a quiet spell she was trying to cast over time itself. The entire month was gone now, days reduced to names, and names reduced to black ink.

She propped the calendar against the wall and stared at it, as though it might speak back to her. Nothing. Just a silent accusation of time wasted and time yet to come.

The pen tapped against the table. Tap. Tap. Tap. Each sound hollow, impatient. Elisabeth's jaw tightened. She hated this room and the kitchen that was also a living room, cluttered and too small, filled with the faint odor of yesterday's coffee.

She flicked on the radio, needing distraction.

""...at discount prices! It's fish of the sea month at COSTCO! SUPER COLOSSAL ALASKAN RED KING CRAB LEGS are only $12.99 a pound, so come on down and reel in your catch!""

A manic, booming voice clattered through the air.

""HEY BUT WHO'S THIS?! WHO'S WHAT? WHO'S ON TOP OF THIS? THE ASSURAN—""

Click. Elisabeth silenced it before the voice could finish.

She stayed seated, her hand resting on the knob, her chest heavy with a sigh she hadn't let out. Silence pressed in again.

Finally, she pushed herself up and drifted into the living room. The old television came alive behind her, its glow casting restless light across the room. She didn't sit. She didn't need to. The TV murmured to itself, spitting out fragments of laughter tracks, weather updates, breaking news—just noise filling the air like smoke.

Then came night.

The bathroom tiles were cold, even from the ground's view. A door opened, spilling a rectangle of pale light across the floor.

Sue laid motionless in its glow.

Elisabeth's white bathrobe brushed the frame, her feet planted like sentinels beside the body. The IV bag hung slackly, only two notches left, two more days, maybe less.

She stood there for a long time, her shadow stretching across Sue's still form.

Then, without a word, she withdrew, closing the door softly behind her.

Darkness swallowed the tiles again.

From somewhere else in the house, the television droned back to life, voices swelling, breaking and fading. Then silence. Then the throb of rhythmic music that was distant at first, but building, pulsing, insistent, as though the walls themselves had begun to breathe.

The music exploded through the apartment, rattling the cabinets as the refrigerator door swung open.

\----

From inside the cold hollow of the fridge, the world came in blinding slices: white light flooding across Sue's skin as she bent down, her breath quick and alive. The syringe tray clinked as she slid it into place—seven small vials, seven more days already mapped out.

Her hand lingered as she reached for a soda. Long, sharp nails painted the red of warning lights. The can hissed open, the metal tab snapping free with a metallic sigh.

Sue straightened, one hip pressing the door closed with a careless thrust. The refrigerator light disappeared, and she filled the room instead, her presence all motion, all rhythm. She stretched, spine flexing like a whip, and drank in long gulps. Bubbles hissed against her teeth.

The bassline drove her across the living room floor. Elisabeth's time was quiet, stagnant and suffocating, it was now gone. This was hers now. Every nerve in her body felt tuned to the music, a pulse she could ride forever.

The television was still on, a dull flickering box casting its pale light over the armchair. The cushion sagged slightly, a worn hollow where Elisabeth had sat night after night.

Sue's eyes narrowed. Just a flicker of disdain, quick and sharp. She grabbed the remote, snapped the screen to black, and turned to the framed photo of Elisabeth hanging crooked on the wall. Her lips curled.

She padded into the bathroom.

Elisabeth lay sprawled across the tiles, lifeless as cloth abandoned on the floor. A body emptied out. Sue leaned against the doorframe, sipping the last of her drink, staring at the pale husk with neither pity nor remorse.

Then—crunch. She crushed the can in her fist, aluminum collapsing with a scream. She tossed it aside and ran her hand along the tiled wall, rapping softly.

Tap. Tap. Tap. She listened. Nothing but echo.

In the bedroom, she tried again. Tap. Tap. Tap. In the closet, she pushed the clothes aside and pressed her knuckles against the plaster. Tock. Tock. Tock. it was hollow.

Her pulse quickened.

Back in the bathroom, she tested the other side. Same sound. Same emptiness. A hollow space between walls. A secret corridor no one had told her about.

Sue stood still, her gaze fixed on the wall. The music kept pulsing from the other room, but here, in this space, it felt like the silence was louder. She tilted her head, considering as her eyes glittered.

Something hidden was waiting there. And she intended to find it.",1,1758635587.0,demonhatstories,0,1.0,False

I proceeded to do some research, and found out about pressurized versus non-pressurized baskets, grinding finer, and so on. Not wanting to spend big bucks on new equipment I ordered the following (from AliExpress and Amazon):

* A bottomless portafilter from AliExpress \~18.5$
* A simple WDT tool from AliExpress \~2.7$
* A dosing ring from AliExpress \~3.9$
* An IMS Precision basket from Amazon \~26$
* A HAVMORE manual coffee grinder from AliExpress \~26$

So in total, around 167$ or 1557 SEK.

I am sure it's not the least anyone has ever spent for good tasting espresso, but for what I spent, I am astounded by how well the shots are turning out. Mostly wanted to share in case someone has purchased the Dedica and been similarly disappointed, it is definitely a capable machine with the right accessories.

Please ignore the residue on the glass.

It wasn’t just physical discomfort, it really affected how clear and present I felt day to day.

I tried everything: cutting foods, taking probiotics, supplements, more coffee for energy, even different sleep routines. Some things helped a little, but the fog and gut discomfort always came back.

Earlier this year, I decided to focus directly on my microbiome. I added more fermented foods, fiber-rich meals, and simple shakes with oats, berries, and yogurt. Within weeks, I noticed something shift — less bloating, steadier digestion, and my head felt lighter, like I could actually think without pushing through a haze.

To keep track of what was working, I first used spreadsheets, but that got old fast. That’s when I built Vitalize: Gut Health Tracker — a way to log food, symptoms, and mood in seconds and even spot correlations with AI. It’s private, simple, and honestly the only reason I’ve stayed consistent.

They have a tie up with a brand called Mannheim Experience Coffee. Pizza Bakery serves Mannheim’s coffee in-house in different forms like cappuccino, cold brew, et cetera.

So I looked them up. I found that they have an outlet in Bangalore and they have a website, so I ended up ordering their cold brew coffee online.

However, I wasn’t extremely happy with the experience because the cold brew took about 2 to 3 days to deliver post dispatch. This means that the shipment has been out for at least two days, if not more, and Coffee can go bad because it’s already been sitting for 18 to 24 hours for brewing and then two days out in the wild without any refrigeration.

You know, I used to think that gritty cup was just part of the deal. I’d pour the last sip and there it was, that fine sediment, like the dregs from a cup of Turkish coffee. It never stopped me from drinking it, but it always felt a little unfinished, like I’d missed a step somewhere.



I remember watching my grandfather make coffee in an old enamel pot on the stove. It was always strong and clear, never muddy. For the longest time, I figured that clarity was lost to some forgotten technique, something modern gadgets couldn't replicate. I’d settled for the idea that a truly clean cup meant sacrificing flavor.



Then, a friend showed me something so simple I almost dismissed it. After pressing the plunger down slowly and steadily, she didn't just start pouring immediately. She waited. Just thirty seconds or so, letting the heavier grounds settle peacefully to the bottom of the pot. It was a quiet pause, a moment of patience.



That tiny delay made all the difference. It turns out the trick isn't in the press itself, but in the stillness that follows. Those last stubborn particles just need a moment to drift down and rest before you pour. Now, that final sip is as smooth as the first, and it finally makes sense. It’s not about force, but a little bit of grace.

1nohnfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1nohnfm/the_night_everything_shifted/,The night everything shifted,"We’d been dating for almost a year, and if you asked me to describe him, I would’ve said: the kindest, most thoughtful man I’ve ever met. He cooks for me, texts me good morning every day, remembers my favorite coffee order. I’ve never felt so safe and cared for in a relationship. So, when he suggested I come meet his family, I was actually excited. I wanted them to see what I saw.

But the whole night felt off. His mom was polite but stiff, like she was walking on eggshells. His sisters kept exchanging looks with each other every time he spoke. At one point, one of them asked me quietly, So, how’s he been with you? in this almost cautious tone, like she was fishing for something I wasn’t in on. I laughed and said, He’s amazing, honestly. The sweetest guy. And they just looked at me like I’d said something unbelievable.

I brushed it off as maybe family dynamics being weird, but it nagged at me. Later in the evening, his mom made a harmless joke about him, and he went quiet in this way that made the room tense. Nobody laughed. It was like they were all bracing for something. Meanwhile, I’m sitting there confused because the man I know has never raised his voice at me, never lost his temper, nothing. On the drive home, he was completely normal again, chatting about how nice it was to see everyone. But I couldn’t stop replaying the looks on his family’s faces. It left me with this uneasy question: did I know him better than anyone else or did they know a side of him I hadn’t seen yet?",6,1758634711.0,story,0,1.0,False

1nohmi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1nohmi6/anyone_else_with_adhd_dealing_with_problems_with/,Anyone else with ADHD dealing with problems with generic Adderall ever since the shortage? And other questions.,"Part vent, part looking for advice or maybe just other people experiencing this?

Ok, so for all my ADHD peeps out there. If you’ve been taking Adderall for a long time (I do mean a long time, I’ve been on it for 20 years, so if you’ve only been on it for a couple years this might not apply to you, or maybe it does, I don’t know) and have had problems with its efficacy since the 2022 shortage, how have you been dealing? There are a TON of people who have experienced a drastic decline in Adderall’s (generic and even name brand) effectiveness in the last few years and it has nothing to do with tolerance. I have been on the same dose since 2005 and have never had an issue until a couple years ago. I can tell the difference between my depression symptoms and executive dysfunction from my ADHD. Yes, it took a long time to be able to distinguish which symptoms are from which illness and I do consider myself lucky to be able to identify what exactly is affecting me. 

Since the shortage, several pharmaceutical companies have been producing generic Adderall to help increase the availability which is great, but the problem is that many of them are either inconsistent or even useless. One specific manufacturer, Mallinckrodt, was literally worse than a placebo. Rather than feeling like drinking a small cup of coffee, it felt more like I was drinking a cup of chamomile tea with a hint of NyQuil. I took it for a couple years because I didn’t realize that it could have been the medication causing the problems. A few years ago I had Lyme disease and that completely drained my energy so for a while I thought that was the issue. I even doubled my dose (with the permission of my psychiatrist) and that didn’t help at all. I told my psychiatrist that I thought there was something wrong with this generic brand and she actually told me that I was among several patients of hers that said they were having the same problems with this manufacturer as well. After calling a dozen pharmacies in my area, I found a small mom and pop pharmacy that carried a new generic that seemed to have positive reviews online so I had her send my prescription to them instead of my usual pharmacy. 

Since beginning the new med, I am REALLY focused and highly functional. I love art and making things and ever since I started this new generic brand I have been spending a lot of time doing tie dye and organizing all my supplies. The thing is, my husband is concerned that I’m “making sandwiches” (if you remember that Vraylar commercial with the woman making sandwiches, if not, here it is: https://www.ispot.tv/ad/dVJd/vraylar-shaky-ground) and I can’t tell if I’m “making sandwiches” or if I’m just finally able to be creative and focused on something that makes me happy. This happened another time around 2015ish (wow that was ten years ago??) when I got really into painting. 

My concern is that I’ve spent around $200 on dye supplies, shirts, and storage containers for this. Other than that, I don’t really seem to be experiencing any other hypo symptoms that I can tell. I’ve been stable on my med combo for a long time, including when I was painting (but I was at a different job, awful job, totally miserable, where now I run my own business and do something I absolutely love so I’m generally happier overall), but I’m curious if this is just the new Adderall allowing me to focus, combined with me having the time and ability to be creative or if there’s more going on. 

Not really asking “am I hypo?” But more like, has anyone else had this issue or do you think maybe the new Adderall is actually working in combo with the fact that I now have the time and ability to be creative? I’ve always been into art and making stuff ever since I was a kid so it’s not out of character for me to be creative and artsy.

1nohmh1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nohmh1,Week 37: Northern - Swedish Cinnamon Buns (Kanelbullar) (meta: vegetarian),"My mother’s side of the family is Swedish so I wanted to use that for this week’s theme. In my search for recipe ideas, I came across something called “Fika” - which really inspired me and is something I want to incorporate into my life:

Swedish fika (pronounced ""fee-kah"") is a cherished daily ritual and social institution in Sweden, encompassing a coffee or tea break with a sweet treat, like a pastry or cookie, and conversation. More than just a break from work, it's a moment to relax, connect with others, and appreciate small joys. Fika can be enjoyed alone or with others, and popular treats include cinnamon buns (kanelbullar) and chocolate balls (chokladbolla).

I decided to make kanelbullar (recipe below). They came out delicious and might have to be added to my holiday baking lineup!

Alright, folks, listen up! If you’re like me, you’ve probably heard about the magic of AI and all the shiny new tools out there that promise to change our lives. But here’s the kicker—are you actually *using* them to make some cash? I mean, c’mon, let’s not leave money on the table, right?

**So, what’s cooking?** Here’s the deal: AI is evolving faster than my attempts to keep plants alive (and trust me, that’s saying something). If you’re not hopping on these monetization opportunities NOW, you might miss out and kick yourself later! 🤦‍♂️

Here are a few ideas to get those creative juices flowing:

1. **Content Creation Galore:**
   - Ever thought about starting a blog or YouTube channel? Use AI to generate killer content ideas, create outlines, or even draft scripts. It’s like having a writing buddy who never sleeps!
   - Tools like Jasper and Copy.ai can whip up engaging articles while you kick back with a cup of coffee. 

2. **Custom Chatbots:**
   - Businesses are all about customer service these days. Why not design a chatbot that helps them engage their clients? You could build, sell, or even *rent* out these bots. Cha-ching!

3. **Online Courses & Workshops:**
   - Are you an expert in something? That knowledge is a goldmine! Use AI to help structure your course materials and make your teaching efficient. You create it once, and make money on repeat!

4. **AI-Powered Social Media Management:**
   - Social media is a necessary evil for many businesses. Offer to take the burden away by managing content and engagements using AI tools to automate the dull bits. You’ll look like a wizard in no time!

5. **Affiliate Marketing with AI Insights:**
   - Use AI to analyze trends and recommend products. Build a niche website and cash in while you sleep. Seriously, who doesn’t want to make money while dreaming of pizza?

Now, before you say, “But I don't have the skills!” let me remind you: **You don’t need to be Elon Musk to tap into this world of possibilities!** 🚀 There are tons of free resources, online courses, and communities (like ours!) that can help you learn what you need.

But don’t wait too long—these opportunities are like that pizza you meant to order last night: tasty, and I swear they vanish when you’re not looking. 

**So, what’s holding you back?** Is it that nagging imposter syndrome or the ultimate fear of failing? Trust me, I get it. But let’s face it, FOMO is not the vibe we want here! You could be the next success story people are talking about. 

And if you're already diving into these opportunities, I'd love to hear how it’s going for you! What’s working and what’s turning out to be a total flop? Let’s share our wins and learnings because, you know, together we can lift each other up and monetize those sweet, sweet AI opportunities. 💪✨",1,1758634473.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

But here’s a list of currently available (as of fall 2025) body mists that kinda react similarly in my nose. 

Maybe it’s the opening, the dry down, the overall tone or depth of the fragrance, or similar notes. If you like one, maybe you can check out the other to compare and see what you like better (spray on skin, wait for dry down). 

I might get side eye for some of these comparisons, and some are “hear me out” kind of deals. While others, maybe legit I should spray them again. Nonetheless, here’s my list!

By the way, I made a shopping guide just for “wear in the fall time” type body mist possibles currently at BBW. Similar info, more detailed, just fall leaning fragrances. https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/s/zsmddoUboA

##Fresh & Fruity

Like Champagne Toast - pink berry, mandarin, champagne 
* Butterfly - just the berry
* Gingham - just the mandarin 
* Champagne Apple and Honey - the champagne, red apple x4 

Like Sweet Pea - clear peony raspberry 
* Sweetest Song? - the raspberry 
* Ghoul Friend - the peony plus Welch’s strawberry fruit snacks 

Like Gingham Fresh - daisy, pear (plus apple) 
* Hello Beautiful - daisy, jasmine, nectarine 
* Vibrant Jasmine (Scent Lab mini) - daisy (jasmine)
* Rain - similar fresh sweetness, bitter cucumber skin 

##The Vanilla Flankers

Like Vanilla Romance - vanilla absolut, smoky cardamom 
* Vanilla Ease - vanilla absolut, herbal lavender, ginger
* Wicked Vanilla Woods - vanilla absolut, smoky woods x2

Like Vanilla Cafe - hazelnut coffee creamer, caramel musk 
* Rich Espresso - hazelnut coffee grounds only
* Glazed Pumpkin - deeper caramel musk, like molasses 
* Whipped Honey and Vanilla? - honey bun icing to caramel musk 
* Delicate Iris - iris (?) to caramel musk 

##Creamy musk 

Like Sunrise Woods - creamy musk, berries 
* Rose - creamy musk, rose water 

##Amber, neroli, orange flower

Like In the Stars - dried orange, amber, hints of browned apple, resinous woods 
* Mediterranean Mirage - equal parts In the Stars (amber) to All Eyes on Her (plum), plus a hint of blue raspberry airhead. 
* Evil Queen - opens ups gilded pear like Tiana. Becomes a caramel apple: fresh pink lady apple, milky caramel coating. The woods have a similar depth as In the Stars but no peppery resin. Gives a curl of powdery smoke instead. Evil Queen is milkier and fresh fruitier, but shares certain similar note.

I don’t mind where you are located!,"Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!",0,1758634395.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.5,False

1nohide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hermes/comments/1nohide/is_hermes_calling_me_even_just_the_slightest/,Is Hermes calling me? Even just the slightest?,"**(Yap!)**  
  
*Hello!* So I'm new to this praising Lord Hermes thing, and I've only ever found myself being comfortable in being a HelPol **(As I am only learning alot about Greek Mythology yet have found myself some happiness in this new religion).** Hermes is my favorite greek god and I feel more comfortable worshipping him to take it slow before praising other gods such as Aphrodite and Apollo.

It's been 2 days since I made a small altar for Hermes. Since my whole family is VERY firm about being catholic, I've been feeling sick at having to believe in God and Jesus knowing I've been praying to them for 6-8 years and none of my prayers have ever been answered. I know that the gods are fine with what type of altar we can make as long as it's theirs, but it feels as though I'm not very well aware about what safe offerings I can put inside the altar without seeming suspicious to my parents. I already have coins, and I usually put my small journal that I write in and place in the altar once I'm finished for Lord Hermes to read.

But something has been bugging me lately. Ever since I've found comfort and happiness in being a HelPol, I've been noticing some changes. I am just a guy that dislikes going out **(Yes, I whine when I have to go out)**  because I prefer staying at home and rotting in bed. Writing is my passion but whenever I buy notebooks or journals I never write and leave it be. But since then, I've been having this want to go out, to stay and relax in coffee shops, to take walks around the village, and to go around field trips and enjoy amusement parks, **(Which, mind you, I have a dislike to amusement parks. They're fun but they're just not it.)** while also feeling motivated to write about things in my notebooks **(I even write stories on paper which I usually never do since I do them digitally)**. I've also sort of been finding some coins for the past few weeks **(Not alot, but still)** and I guess I've been using them to offer to Lord Hermes?

Just tonight, my dog, a pomerian that is quite into stealing things and always planting something evil, have visited my room 3 times. He doesn't do this, sometimes, but that's once in a blue moon. He stayed by my side before running to my parent's room and repeated. He took something from my room and hid under the couch, which of course, was a usual mischievous act of his, but he never takes anything from my room.

I aswell have always had good gut feelings. But for the past few months my gut feelings have been wrong and would constantly embarrass me. But now, my gut feelings somehow have turned correct. I can't tell if this is by luck, or if my skills have just gotten back. Moving on, I am actually at my extreme lowest. Was. I feel so much better since days ago and have been feeling like I was healed. I might also be feeling some connection with Lord Hermes. I have been finding comfort in his altar, and I feel like he's a trusted person I can always talk to. Do you think Lord Hermes is atleast trying to respond to me? Just a little? I'm an overthinker and a quick doubter so I doubt Lord Hermes even has time to let me be as his devotee.

1nohhxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Generator/comments/1nohhxc/another_sizing_question_rural_wellseptic_use_case/,Another sizing question - rural well/septic use case in cold climate,"In in the mountains in Colorado on well and septic, so looking for something to keep the power, water and heat on during big winter snow storms. Our primary heat is hydronic heating with a natural gas combo boiler (also provides domestic hot water). I think the biggest draw on electricity will be our well pump - I believe it’s a 3/4hp 230v, but I’m not sure the model or starting watts and not sure how to find out. The home is about 3500sq ft so a decent amount of outlets, lights etc. Our cooktop is natural gas.
  
 Electrical appliances I won’t be using with the generator:   
   
-handful of legacy electric baseboard heaters.  
- 230v steam humidifier.  
- hot tub heater.   
- double oven.  
- clothes dryer.    
  
What I will be using:   
   
- well pump plus 4 heating zone pumps (low watt ECM motor)
- gas boiler with circulation pump
- outlets, lights, etc. highest usage probably from coffee maker.  3 TVs (not more than 2 on at any given time, usually just 1)
- Starink Gen 3 and router/access points
- 2 gas fireplaces with fans.  
- 2 fridge/freezers (one 36” and smaller 24” in basement)   
   
What would be nice to use:   
    
- central vacuum since we have 3 pets and kids.  
- 20amp induction cooktop in basement Airbnb unit.   
- basement 77” oled and 5.2.4 sound system  ( I know this is probably a stretch)   
  
I’m thinking that a generator in the 9000 running watt range should be sufficient to maybe get 1 or 2 of my nice to haves, but probably not all 3. Is there any good way to accurately measure all of this? Or would I just need to measure each one individually?

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever had one of those days where you just can’t seem to find your groove? You wake up, full of ideas, but by lunchtime, you’re scrolling through TikTok wondering where all the motivation went. I feel you! We've all been there, right?

Here’s the thing: **motivation is like that friend who says they’ll help you move but never shows up.** Great in theory, but often MIA when you need it most. So let's dig into why chasing motivation is kinda like chasing your own tail.

**Here’s the brutal truth: high achievers don’t wait for motivation.** They create systems. They show up even when they don’t feel inspired. Here’s how:

- **Discipline > Motivation:**  
  Motivation gets you started, but discipline carries you through. It’s like the trusty GPS that doesn’t care if you’re not in the mood for a road trip. Just plug in the destination and drive!

- **Set Small, Achievable Goals:**  
  Ever tried running a marathon without training? Yeah, not gonna happen. Start with small, bite-sized goals. Celebrate the mini-wins! They add up faster than you think.

- **Create a Routine:**  
  Your brain loves predictability. Develop a daily routine that sets aside time for your goals, even when the motivational fairy hasn’t sprinkled her magic dust on you. 

- **Switch Up Your Environment:**  
  Sometimes, all it takes is a change of scenery. Work at a coffee shop, rearrange your workspace, or even just take a walk outside. **Fresh air can work wonders!**

- **Connect with Others:**  
  Surround yourself with people who inspire you (or at least don’t drain your energy). Share your goals and hold each other accountable. After all, teamwork makes the dream work, am I right?

But let’s get real for a sec—some days are tougher than others. You might be in a funk, and that’s okay! Remember, **it’s about persistence, not perfection.** Even the best of us have off days. 

And here’s a little secret: **the magic happens when you lean into the discomfort.** When you push through the days you don't feel like it, that’s when growth occurs. It's the grind that makes success taste so sweet.

So, let’s stop the endless quest for that ever-elusive motivation. Let’s focus on what really counts—showing up, day after day, putting in the work, and trusting the process. 

What about you? How do you keep yourself moving when motivation is nowhere to be found? Let's swap tips and tricks!",1,1758633241.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Then a few days later she admitted she hadn't long broke up with her ex-partner, it hadn't been her decision, and she still wasn't over him or ready to date. She said she liked me and wanted to keep in touch and see what might happen in a few weeks.

So we sent each other a casual message every few days, nothing serious. Last weekend she suggested we meet up again, so we did, and then she suggested we meet up again last week, so we did. Nothing physical happened, but it was nice to spend time with her. I took her out for a coffee and then suggested that we meet this weekend. She then said she'd been thinking and she wasn't ready for a relationship and needed to take a step back, but still wanted to keep my number and message me if / when she was ready.

Going for Sunrise coffee again because it's GOATed and it's closing soon 😭

**What I had:**  
\#02-05 Rui Ji Vegetarian  
Rice + 4 sides ($5.50)

I am going to caveat this by saying that this is my first vegetarian caifan in a decade, so I really have no idea what a good vegetarian caifan is supposed to taste like. 

**What I liked:**  
I'm the classic guy who likes meat a lot, and this was surprisingly decent. The mock meat had a really smoth texture that didn't feel too tough nor dry. I've had real meat that tastes worse than it. 

The fried egg was very proper; crispy egg white parts, while still keeping the egg yolk creamy and not too hard. 

Lotong curry was extremely creamy and had loads of ingredients - lady finger, pineapple (?), and a huge piece of what tasted like fish cake (but I'm sure it's not fish cake) inside. 

Auntie called me shuai ge (handsome boy), I very happy. 

**What I didn't like:**  
There wasn't anything that I didn't like, everything was ""good"" or ""fine"". Of course that doesn't mean that it's perfect. It's a good plate of food but it's not a great plate of food. 

**Final Rating:**  
2 plates - it's very very good, but it didn't wow me and at the end of the day, i'll still stick to meat unless im feeling healthy that day. ",3,1758632935.0,SingaporeEats,0,1.0,False

I’m a former nespresso user who’s decided to make the jump to big girl espresso machines. After years of using a nespresso machine, convenience is a big factor for me. I run around like a madman in the mornings (ADHD brain going crazy) and need an option that will make the experience as simple as possible. I’ve can’t even consider options like a moka pot because I would not have the time or patience to wait while the coffee brews.  An option that’s easy to keep clean will also be a priority for me.

Price is a little flexible, I’ve been looking at models from both breville and delonghi at anywhere from 300-1000 dollars in price. If I need to buy an automatic machine, I will do that. If I need to buy a good grinder, I will do that. I want to get good espresso and relative ease. That’s worth the investment for me. 

I’m not a coffee snob and am easily satisfied, but my boyfriend has the potential to be and I’d love to have something for both of us to enjoy (and maybe even a hobby for him!) down the line.

For the last 3 months, almost every day I wake up with a vibrating, pulsing headache--not exactly painful, more like a whooshing white noise in my head. Definitely feels like vasodilation as the whoosh is often in time with my heart beat. 

I assume the antibiotics did something to my gut, and that I am now uber-sensitive to something in foods,  but I've tried everything and the headaches won't go away. 

Some days I'm at a level 3 and I can function. Other days are a level 8 and the fatigue that accompanies the headache is overwhelming. I took antibiotics for hpylori and the only gut issue I have now is a need to pass my bowels when my headache is at its worse. And *maybe* sone relief after, but not really. I know all about the gut brain connection and assume there's a link there. 

At first I thought it was histamine, now I'm thinking maybe some sort of preservative. The only time the headaches improve at all is when I fast (unhappily). No medication, including toradol or sumatriptin, help.

I have stopped coffee and tea, and for three weeks ate very clean with no processed food.  starting today I am going to eat only unpackaged foods, so just apples, eggs, potatoes, and some sort of non inflammatory veg to see if that helps. Restricting food is annoying when you see no benefit, so a few times I've just given up and eaten my regular healthy, veg diet and things worsened about 25%. 

So nothing really helps, and nothing really worsens. It just feels like I'll have this headache forever. 

I'm going absolutely insane. Any help welcome. I feel like I've tried everything. I even considered it wasn't food at all but barometric pressure, but can find no discernable link. ",1,1758632732.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

1. I am looking to spend about $800USD on a hotel for one night. Typically I stay at chain hotels, but was curious about staying in a boutique hotel or something more “swanky” since it’s just one night. I was thinking around Central Park, but that’s only because of previous trips.

2. Looking for recommendations on a good Italian dinner prior to seeing a show at The Beacon. Will travel by cab/subway, if it’s too far to walk. Favorite bars in the area? 

3. I booked us a tour of the NYPL. Any other activities worth mentioning? Budget isn’t a huge factor. Wouldn’t be upset visiting a spa or a relaxing museum the day after a night out.

I will be talking about 5 star DPS team comps so I’m not writing this for a few more weeks for the 4 stars lol. If you want any tips for those teams, let me know in the comments and I should be able to give some advice.

I am FTP+ (I buy the monthly pass) so I don’t have better knowledge on units I don’t have, though I’ll do try my best. Also this is only recommendations, not what you have to do, more a push in the right direction, this is for fun after all.

If you want more information, please use Prydwen as it currently gives good advice on recommended teams and Personas. As well as what future units can do.

***Small quick tips:***

\- For your Elucidators (Navis I.e Wind, Okyann, Puppet, Phoebe) they share a certain percentage of their stats with the party, including Crit rate and Crit damage, so make sure that the star card is a Crit rate (or crit damage card depending on the DPS like Skull who always crits on his skill 3).

\- If you have a A1 Bui she doesn’t need a crit rate star card, as her a1 makes her follow up attacks automatically have 30% more crit rate.

\- Read Personas abilities, they are the reason why certain units are here. Also if you do have the coffee, try to overlock some Personas as it can greatly improve certain units as well as adding more text.

\- Change these teams to what you prefer, I always have a healer in the team but if you want to make Wonder the healer to get Chord in a team for instance, that’s your choice. Just make sure to have a good healer, Persona Titania at least, Lakshmi is currently the best, change your Sigmata to what’s appropriate and use the second palace knife, All in.

***Joker***

https://preview.redd.it/cxpy8coeuwqf1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=319722478beefd2073543430c84fecdb36bf262f

**Teammates:** Joker, Rin, Marian, Wind

**Personas:** Alice, Surt, Dionysus

Nothing much has changed in this team, Marian is just a better healer than Morgana. If you plan on getting Summer Tomoko I would her her instead of Marian in this team comp as Joker can deliver the sparks needed via his attacks and the dmg taken improving being good for Joker.

Wind can be substituted for Phoebe, it does just depend on Personal preference and how much Wonder is using curse Personas. I do just enjoy the debuffs Wind can give.

Wonder is a debuffer in this team, using Alice, Surt, and Dionysus. If you don’t have time for creating Alice, I would recommend getting Dominion as he’s more universally usable. Surt is necessary as his aoe def down is amazing in multiple teams, Dionysus is a good crit buffer all around, a high priority Persona. Alice is kinda a pain in this team, the nearly 28% curse damage taken to enemies, not taking into account with the boost from the ailment accuracy, is amazing to have on a curse team, the issue is that her skill, Die for Me, only works for 2 turns so in rotation it’s going to be something like:

*Alice, Surt, Alice, Dionysus, Alice, Surt, Alice, Donysus*

Also use the Ex Machina, as it isn’t good for his own damage but when you come into battle with Alice, the whole party will get a curse attack buff.

***Panther***

https://preview.redd.it/yo0osi2huwqf1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc9618d8dabe51d234e93a622f962fa3f671254

**Teammates:** Panther, Key, Cattle, Pheobe

**Personas:** Baphomet, Surt, Dionysus

Same team as last time, the only change is Phoebe as this team is basically the best case scenario for her.

The main change is Wonder, he’s a debuffer, buffer and sub DPS. Baphomet is the sub DPS, when the enemy is at it’s weakest (Key skill 2, Ann Highlight etc.) utilise his skill and he will add a nearly 30% fire dmg taken to the enemies, he also does a lot of good damage. Dionysus is here instead of Dominion so Key can actually do some damage as when built he can be a good debuffer and a decent sub DPS in this team. Surt has all foe def down, it’s almost required.

***Skull***

https://preview.redd.it/1u6s0pqiuwqf1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b8b274873fd6d0df8620efa1db6fc36821c4de3

**Teammates:** Skull, Leon, Soy, Puppet

**Personas:** Belphegor, Dominion, Norn / Chernobog

Same team as last time, as currently there’s nothing to change, Leon is good to activate Skull’s Rebound, Soy increases survivability, and Puppet keeps Skull in his Rebound range range whilst keeping him alive and giving him buffs.

Wonder is a Buffer and Debuffer in this team, we’ve been knew. No Dionysus on this team as Skull should mostly be using his Skill 3 which always crits so you’re only getting a little crit dmg buff. Belphegor is here for his single target def down, Dominion is here for his attack boost, and Norn and Chernobog is interchangeable depending on what you need. More survivability? Norn and you get to apply windswept a lot, More debuffs? Chernobg for effect res, Def, and phy dmg down.

***Bui***

*With Closer*

https://preview.redd.it/3ltgqzwluwqf1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=36127b2543ddaf36332c6692b2b2785fb974f1a6

**Teammates:** Bui, Closer, Marian, Okyann

**Personas:** Dionysus, Belphegor, Dominion

Similar to the Joker team, not much has changed, Marian is here, and I would recommend keeping her here even if you plan on getting Summer Moko, the attack buff Marian can give is just preferred.

I would recommend Okyann in this team, her Ailment acc is really nice as when the enemy has shock then Yui does more damage. Phoebe wouldn’t work here as she needs at least 3 characters (wonder counts) to have the same element to make the best cocktails.

Wonder in this team is a Buffer / Debuffer, Dionysus is here again as he is just really useful with revolution and giving 22% crit dmg to main target, Belphegor is the easiest unit to get Rakunda and decrease def by 36.9% there's also Garuda who can also be used. Dominion is a really good buffer, cohesion increases team attack and increases main target damage and his ability also just buffs that target allies attack. I regret not getting Dominion earlier. He does have the issue that Alice has, where his buff is only active for two turns.

*With Wonder*

https://preview.redd.it/3huyne1ouwqf1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c69ba6e4ee327341b8ad96daa0b2a329f9bc627

**Teammates:** Bui, Chord, Marian, Phoebe

**Personas:** Oberon

This is a team I haven’t shown before, but one I enjoy using from time from time. This has Wonder being the sub DPS, in place of Closer. This allows Chord to be on the team, which I enjoy as it allows Yui to use her highlight more.

Phoebe can get her cocktails much easier in this team and give better electric buffs, if you don’t have her, I would recommend Okyann.

Wonder in this team is a Sub DPS, please remember to change his Schema to more of a more DPS build. By giving him some Crit rate, Crit damage and Ailment Acc to apply Shock. For Personas to use, I use Oberon, you can use Yurlungur, who can increase enemies crit dmg taken, or if you want to work on something harder, getting a Thor and giving him Ziodyne or another Zio single target skills (Yurlungur does have Ziodyne as a teach skill).

***Fox***

https://preview.redd.it/2cy0wcqquwqf1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9d3bf4f33d8d690eec32719f1fc6b619cd06bc

**Teammates:** Fox, Yuki, Rin, Puppet

**Personas:** Norn, Dionysus, Mithras

The team hasn’t changed from the previous post, and it propbably won’t change till Cherish or 5\* Mont, but still this is a solid team. The only character in this team you might not have would be Rin, if so I would just recommend having Mont for extra damage and giving Wonder some debuff Personas in this team.

Wonder in this team is a def buffer for Fox and yuki, With Mithras improving team wide def improvements, Norn is here for their ability as when an enemy is windswept their defence is decreased by 22.8%, which their wind barrier can apply, if that is causing you issues try to train a Aoe Garu skill on them. And I don’t need to say why Dionysus is here. If you have the investment get King frost, massive shields and an ice dmg bonus. In this team I would get rid of Norn for the king. Also make sure Wonder has All In.

***Queen***

https://preview.redd.it/hnfuwwrsuwqf1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=2673e7ae2ac37c21f63e3987d1dafd02ededadd5

**Teammates:** Queen, Vino, Marian, Okyaan

**Personas:** Belfegor, Dionysus, Dominion

Now a team I didn’t do last time, Queen’s is all around big single target dmg, so reasonably you want the fight to be against one foe. Marian is the general healer, I don’t see too many Healers on Makoto teams so switch her out with Chord if you’re confidant that Wonder can do the healing. Vino can increase nuke dmg by applying radiation and is just a general nuke debuffer, she is practically necessary for Queen. If you don’t have Vino, use Leon he’ll just be buffing Queen instead.

Wonder is a general buffer / debuffer similar to previous teams, the only change I would suggest is if you can, or want Queen to do more damage, get Bishamoten. He improves nuke dmg the enemy takes up to 40%. Also make sure you have the Arc Knife.

***Tropical Motoha***

https://preview.redd.it/vi37xpxuuwqf1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a3680603ed426ffcf74cbf7a2eb67d70abbe0d3

**Teammates:** T. Motoha, Chord, Marian, Wind

**Personas:** Domion, Surt, Dionysus

Motoha needs bless units, Marian is the main one with Wonder helping more with it. Chord is the main buffer and helping Motoha improve her highlight which does a good amount of damage, if you don’t have Chord (doubt) then use Leon, Marian is nearly necessary for the amount of healing needed to buff Motoha.

Wind is there for the debuffs, no one else is better here.

Wonder is Buff / Debuffer. I’ve mentioned what they’ve done before, Domion buffs attacks, Surt aoe def down, Dionysus is Crit boosting. The only change depends on how much you want to invest in her, if you want her to do more damage, get Melchizedek. Boosting bless dmg and attack and allows him to do decent damage as well. Also utilise the Glimmer dagger,

***Future Characters***

Only one future team this time, as the next few characters that will be released are more buffers and sub DPSs, with some of the upcoming ones being Summer Moko, Oracle, and 5\* Mont. With the only DPS being Messa.

A DoT (Damage over time) unit that focuses on afflicting bleed stacks on foes and doing extra damage with Laceration, an extra attack that mostly happens when an opponent has 3 or more stacks of bleed.

You could do something similar to Skull but make it:

*Messa, Leon, Healer, Okyann*

The issue with Skull is that he doesn’t want healing which is why you have Soy & Puppet there, whilst Messa doesn’t mind healing and depending on your healer you can gain buffs and debuffs that will help him.

A different team would be swapping Leon out for Chord so he can use his highlight more as his makes his transform into his executioner form, which does more damage, and does damage when activated.

For Wonders Personas, Chernobog decreases effect res, def and phys dmg taken when nightmare is inflicted which is what Messa needs. Otherwise a buffer like Dionysus would be helpful to make sure that Messa crits with all of his hits and either Dominion or a single target debuffer would be good.

***End***

At the end of the day, play whatever you want. Hell when I’m running through mementos and Palaces I run non of these teams, I run a Joker, Bui, Marian and Wind team as the amount of extra attacks is very fun. These teams are more mean for endgame content such as Nightmare gateway, just to help you get that extra damage out.

If you want more information, like I said at the beginning, look into the characters yourself and look into Prydwen. Do some personal research but if you want some extra info, I don’t mind any questions you may have.

Anyway, I’m going to hide and write more Jokawan fanfics. See you all in a few months when there’s more units.

1nogrmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nogrmt/the_kitchen_catastrophe_that_brought_us_together/,The Kitchen Catastrophe That Brought Us Together,"I honestly didn't think a recycling bin could cause so much emotional damage. Living with Maya, Liam, and Chloe in our urban apartment was usually a vibe, but the kitchen had become a war zone. It started subtly – a pizza box left out, a coffee ring on the counter. Then it escalated. The recycling bin, specifically. It was perpetually overflowing, a towering monument of cardboard and plastic that, lowkey, stressed me out every time I walked past it.

Chloe, our resident neat freak, was visibly twitchy. I'd catch her sighing dramatically, or find a passive-aggressive Post-it on the fridge that read, ""Does this look full to anyone else? Asking for a friend (the planet)."" Maya, ever the social butterfly, would just push things down with her foot, murmuring, ""Oh, I'll get it next time, promise!"" Liam? Liam was just… Liam. He’d walk past it like it was an invisible art installation, then disappear into his room to game. I was lowkey getting tired of being the only one who seemed to notice it, or the crumbs, or the mystery stains. Ngl, I was on the verge of just buying a tiny apartment for myself and living in blissful, solitary cleanliness.

One Tuesday morning, I walked into the kitchen to make coffee and found a rogue yogurt container, still half-full, precariously balanced on top of the already overflowing recycling, teetering. It was the last straw. I thought about just silently chucking it, but then I realized this wasn't about the yogurt; it was about the unspoken frustration building up. ""Guys,"" I announced later that evening, calling an impromptu house meeting in the living room, ""we need to talk about the kitchen.""

It started a bit awkwardly. Chloe launched into a detailed account of the bin's transgressions, Maya looked sheepish, and Liam, well, Liam was just surprised we were having a meeting. But I made sure to steer the conversation away from blame. ""Look,"" I said, ""it’s not about who did what last. It’s about figuring out a system that works for all of us, right? We all use this space."" We ended up making a simple chore chart for daily kitchen tidy-ups and a weekly deep clean, assigning specific tasks like taking out the recycling and wiping down counters. We also decided to get a bigger recycling bin, which, honestly, felt revolutionary. Liam even suggested a shared digital shopping list for communal items like dish soap and paper towels.

The change wasn't instant, but it was significant. The kitchen slowly transformed from a source of dread to a functional, even enjoyable, space. We started actually having impromptu cooking nights together, laughing as we navigated who was on ""bin duty"" that week. I realized that a little direct communication, even when it feels uncomfortable, can actually bring people closer. We weren’t just roommates anymore; we were a proper house, connected by a shared appreciation for a clean counter and an empty recycling bin.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

1nogr1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1nogr1w/berlin_marathon_2025/,Berlin Marathon 2025 🔥,"Wow… What an unforgettable day! September 21st, 2025 marks the day I broke my marathon PR once again, running 2:38:03 in Berlin. This was only my third marathon, and to do it at a World Marathon Major in tough conditions made it extra special. It’s 2 day later now, and I’m still in shock at what happened out there. Let me break down the lead-up, the race, and the experience.

**Race Information:**

* Berlin Marathon
* September 21st 2025
* Berlin Germany

**Strava Link -->** [**https://www.strava.com/activities/15885932041/overview**](https://www.strava.com/activities/15885932041/overview)

**Race Stats:**

* **Official End Time:** 2:38:03
* **Average Pace:** 3:45/km
* **Average HR:** 157

**Personal Info:**

* Male
* 23 Years Old
* Belgian

**Training**

This build was about consistency balance, and enjoyment. Peak mileage topped at 105 km, with a strong mix of long runs, intervals, and marathon specific workouts. Three weeks out, I ran a 35 km session with 4 × 4 km intervals and 4 km floats, a workout that gave me a lot of confidence.

Tapering followed the classic principle, ""reduce volume, keep intensity"" Mileage dropped from 85 km → 70 km → 40 km (race week), with final workouts like 3 × 2 km at marathon pace with 1 km float 4 days out. I arrived in Berlin knowing I had put in the work and just needed to execute.

**The Day Before**

The expo was electric. Picking up bib 56570 made it reel real. I was running my first Major. Berlin was buzzing, the Brandenburg Gate, the marathon wall of names, the Adidas and Nike pop-ups and all the other activities. It gave me goosebumps. The evening was spent finalizing my race plan. I programmed my Garmin with six 30-minute intervals, each signaling when to take a gel. My target pace range was set to 3:50–4:10/km, knowing the heat would be a factor. Dinner was simple: pasta, red sauce, chicken. Simple but effective

**Nutrition**

Carb-loading was on point. \~500 g of carbs per day Friday and Saturday. Race morning, I had 125 g of carbs 3 hours before (bread, honey, banana, isotonic drink + coffee) and another 25 g of carbs 1 hour before the gun in the form of an isotonic drink for both hydration and electrolytes. During the race, I aimed for 80 g carbs/hour, using Maurten 160 gels every 30 minutes. I took 4 Maurten 160s through 33 km, then a Maurten 100 at 38 km. Hydration was tougher, with temps rising to 27°C, I doused myself at every aid station. But this did very little since the heat just rose and rose hahaha.

**RACE DAY**

Woke up at 5:30 AM, calm but buzzing. Gear was laid out, breakfast went down smoothly, and then we navigated the chaos of Berlin public transport. At one point, everyone was waiting at the wrong train... I sprinted last-second to the right one, heart rate already up XD. At the start, I met Stephani (NuttyFoodieFitness on YouTube), which was such a cool and grounding moment. Then, did some warm up strides with an ex-pro Ironman athlete Tim Van Hemel which helped get  me locked in. The corral was madness. Unlike ive ever seen before. People climbing fences, and entering the wrong corrals. The air already hot, and I was sweating before the gun went off. Then I knew it would be a hard day.

***The Race Itself:***

**0–21K:** I went out hot. 3:40–3:42/km pace felt too good, and I split the half marathon in 1:17. I knew it was aggressive, but I was rolling.  
**21–30K:** The real battle began. Heat hit 25°C, and my body started fighting back. Pace slipped to 3:45–3:50/km, and mentally it was brutal. For a moment, I thought about dropping out but I refused. I reminded myself of all the training, all the sacrifices.  
**30–35K:** Belief returned. A fellow runner I passed turned to me and told me, “Just a little over 8K left,” and that was the spark. I surged again, fueled by the crowd.  
**35–42K:** Took one extra Maurten 100 gel at 38K that i picked up from the aid statation, punched a Mario Kart mushroom sign at 40K (crowd went wild), and emptied the tank. Seeing the Brandenburg Gate at 41K gave me goosebumps. The blue carpet, the clock under 2:40 I knew I had it. Crossed in 2:38:03. PR secured!!!!

The moment I stopped, everything hurt. I laughed with another runner, saying: *“I don’t feel like sitting, walking, or running... everything hurts haha.”* But inside, I was overwhelmed with pride. Meeting my dad at the finish was emotional. He’s been my rock throughout this journey, and sharing this with him meant everything. Medal engraved -> first Abbott World Major star earned. We celebrated with beers, pizza, and one of the coolest waiters ever at a local Italian spot. By the time we were back at the hotel, I was still in disbelief.

Berlin 2025 was the hardest battle of my life. The heat, the doubts, the grind from 20–30K; it tested me like never before. But I pushed through and came out stronger.

I’m proud. 2:38:03 in Berlin. Another huge step forward.  
Berlin taught me that running isn’t just about the splits, it’s about the fight. ",8,1758632436.0,Marathon_Training,2,0.83,False

I figured I would post this here since this was rejected from the publisher I submitted this to! I apologize for the abrupt ending I had a word limit.

Any feed back is good feed back! I struggle with conversations.

Daniel Marris cupped his mug between cold, tired hands. The faint warmth from the cup was a whisper against the chill. He never meant to feel like this, so insensate, so small.

Ashbridge wasn’t the kind of college town that welcomed people like him. Not with its sleek buildings, gene-printed students, and families boasting generational wealth. Daniel came from the edge of industry, a place of worn-out boots, broken heaters, and dinners stretched with boxed rice. His mom hadn’t worked since the accident that mangled her back. His dad worked double shifts on scaffolds. Daniel’s acceptance into Ashbridge’s engineering program had been a glimmer of hope, but it came with a cost.

*The Sensory Cost.*

He thought back to speaking with student services. “You can pay with cash, with time, or you can pay with a sense.” A brutal and excruciating practice, born out of the student debt crisis that left half a generation bankrupt. Now, students from working- and middle-class backgrounds could pay for college with their senses, losing a sense either all at once or in scheduled increments.

Most students gave up their sense of taste, a way to save money and avoid the freshman fifteen. A few brave souls surrendered their hearing or sight.

Daniel chose touch.

He reasoned it would be the least disruptive to his mechanical engineering degree. He could still read off the board, listen to lectures, and enjoy the free food at campus events. Unfortunately, the impact of this decision was far greater than he expected.

By the end of the fall semester of his sophomore year, Daniel had already surrendered over 40% of his tactile input. He could still type, still write, but the sensation of pen on paper felt like scribbling on air. He noticed it most in the cold: the numbness in his fingers didn’t sting. Ashbridge winters were sharp and bitter, but to Daniel, this winter arrived like a ghost.

Daniel sat at his dorm desk, sipping coffee that tasted bitter and metallic. To him, it felt lukewarm despite the visible steam. He tried not to think about the sensation he was missing. He couldn’t think about it, the thought only fed the ever-growing dread in his stomach. Sitting before him, on the coffee-ring-stained desk, there was another payment notice.

“SEMESTER PAYMENT DUE: Failure to remit may result in administrative lockout.”

This payment would require another 30% of his remaining touch, enough to dull nearly everything but the sharpest pain.

Daniel stood shakily. He struggled to steady himself between his dread and the fuzzy, nearly numb feeling in his feet. The sensation, or lack thereof, was like a crawling numbness, a fizzing static. Daniel had grown accustomed to the hollow tingling his body now felt. As he exited his dorm, he remembered to grab his jacket. Even if he couldn’t feel the cold of winter, the cold could still bite him.

As he walked to the payment clinic, he found himself thinking of the children he used to hear about on his mother’s daytime television shows; children born without the ability to feel. Congenital analgesia: the inability to feel pain. Most kids with this syndrome died within their first three years. A few reached their early to mid-twenties. Daniel planned to graduate in two and a half years. If he couldn’t pony up the money for his junior year, he would be left without any sense of touch. He wouldn’t be able to feel any pain. The dread in his stomach jerked at the thought of surviving nearly two years without touch or pain at all.

As Daniel approached the steps of the payment clinic, he shook his head, trying to physically shake the idea from his mind. The payment clinic was a nondescript building on the edge of campus. To a passerby, there would be no way to guess that young students were sacrificing their senses, their connections to the world, in an effort for a better future. Inside was clinical and sterile; Daniel noted the intense scent of alcohol and disinfectant as he stepped through the glass doors.

“You still have options,” the blonde-haired clerk said flatly, without looking up from her terminal. “We can schedule the extraction for tomorrow or next week. If you wish to defer with loans, you’ll need co-signers. Parents?”

Daniel shook his head. “No. I… my dad already works two jobs. Mom can’t.”

“Then I’d recommend scheduling the payment.”

Daniel scheduled his appointment for tomorrow, ignoring the dread now gnawing at his insides. As he turned to leave, he overheard two students whispering near the doors.

“She can barely function,” snickered a tall, tan girl, whom Daniel recognized from his Human-Machine Ergonomics class.

“She basically has no senses since her last payment. You would think she’d have gotten a job by now,” said the other girl, slightly shorter with an olive complexion, mockingly.

“Maybe she wants to be one of those,” the first girl paused, making a face of disgust, “inactives.” Both girls snickered.

As Daniel passed them, he kept his eyes lowered. He didn’t want to be noticed, not here of all places.

*Inactives*, he thought, his dread deepening. The word clung to him like frost on the world around him. Inactives, or inactive citizens, were individuals who lost all their senses and were deemed devoid of any fiscal utility.

He knew who those girls were talking about. It was hard not to. Mara, a once beautiful and lithe girl Daniel met during freshman orientation. At the time, she’d left him flustered with her brilliant smile and bubbly personality. Now she was the personification of the grim consequences Daniel dreaded. He wasn’t sure whether it was out of morbid curiosity or genuine concern that he wanted to see her.

He found Mara on the campus fringe, hunched beside her car, the engine long dead and windows fogged from nights of breath. She was crouched on thin, trembling legs, reaching for a half-drank bottle of water that lay just out of reach under her car.

Daniel approached her, heart pounding in his ears but not in his chest. He didn’t know what to say.

“I got it,” he said, raising his voice as much as he could. Mara jumped, clearly unaware she had been approached. Daniel lowered himself prone onto the rough, cold asphalt, which registered little to him. He grabbed the bottle of water, accidentally denting it with the force of his grasp.

He stood carefully, making sure not to stumble or waver in public.

“Here.” He handed her the bottle slowly enough for her to register its presence.

Mara blinked slowly, her green eyes struggling to find his. She was ghostlike and thin. She grasped the cold bottle as best as she could.

“Thanks,” she said cautiously, taking a step back.

“I—It’s Daniel, Daniel Marris, from freshman orientation,” he said nervously in a loud voice.

Mara took a moment to process his words.

“It’s been a while.” She laughed nervously. Daniel went through the motions of small talk. He desperately didn’t want to acknowledge her current state. But as they spoke, a morbid need to understand welled up inside him. As their simple pleasantries began to end, without thinking, Daniel blurted, “What happened?” He realized how rude he sounded, but his dread controlled his tongue. “I mean… how did it get this bad?”

Mara gave a weak smile; her voice was flat.

“My dad lost his job right before the start of freshman year. I couldn’t afford tuition.” She inhaled sharply, fighting tears. “I started with taste. Figured I wouldn’t miss it much. Then I gave up touch, it didn’t seem important at the time.” This statement stung Daniel. “After that, smell. Then bit by bit my sight.”

Daniel’s throat tightened. “And your hearing?”

“Still have most of it,” she said, glancing toward the overcast sky. Daniel was unsure of how much she could really take in of it. Mara continues, “I can’t drive anymore. Can’t keep up in lectures. No one’s gonna hire me like this.”

Daniel looked down guiltily. She was a mirror of his fears. Mara reached into her coat and pulled out a small object: a worry stone, verdant and speckled with golds and browns, smooth except for a deep thumb-groove worn through use.

“I want to give you this.” She placed it in his hand. Her fingers didn’t twitch. “I don’t need it anymore.”

Daniel looked down at the stone in his palm. It was still warm from her hand, or at least he thought it was. Maybe he just remembered what warmth used to feel like. He didn’t want to tell her he could barely feel its cool, silken curve, no more than a ghost in his hand.

“Thanks,” he said, voice low.

Mara nodded once. “I use it to remind myself I’m still here.”

Daniel looked down at the smooth stone, turning it slowly in his palm. “It’s... nice. Thank you.” He kicked himself internally for being so awkward. He already had a hard enough time talking to girls, but he was ill-equipped to say anything more meaningful to her.

Mara’s gaze drifted toward her car, empty and quiet.

“I need to sleep,” she murmured. “The back seat stays warm enough, most nights.”

She turned without waiting for a reply and opened the driver’s side door. With a slow, practiced motion, she crawled into the back, curled up like a shadow folding into itself. The door shut with a soft click.

Daniel stood on the curb, half relieved the conversation was over, the stone in his hand cooling fast in the fading afternoon light.

That night, as Daniel walked home through silent streets dusted with ice, he ran his fingers over the stone, hoping to glean the feeling of Mara’s touch through it.

That night, Daniel stared at the ceiling above his bed. His dread growing, aching his stomach. The thought of Mara haunted him, feeding his dread larger. The memory of touch surfaced like a whisper. He thought of not feeling his mother’s hugs, nor the warmth of coffee cutting through cold mornings, and not being able to recreate the thrill of skin-on-skin contact that he had experienced during his first time the summer after high school.

He tried bargaining with his own mind: Just finish the degree. Get a job. Pay to restore the nerves.

But he’d read the fine print. Reversals were inconsistent. Sometimes nerves didn’t reactivate. Sometimes sensation came back wrong, pain where there should be pleasure. Sometimes nothing returned at all.

He squeezed the worry stone until his knuckles whitened. He could still feel it. Faintly. He didn’t know if that was comforting or horrifying.

The next morning, the day of payment, had arrived.

The dread inside him thrashed him awake.

On his way to the payment clinic, he took the long way to see Mara. She was gone. Her car sat on the curb, empty and frosted over. The dread clawed at Daniel’s insides.

It wasn’t until he had walked through the glass doors of the payment clinic that he realized he had forgotten his jacket. The cold bit him, but he perceived it as barely a chill. Daniel only saw his hands, red, their protests against the cold going unnoticed.

Daniel sat in the waiting room, surrounded by other students with blank faces and nervous postures. No one spoke. He rubbed the worry stone. Its surface was familiar now. His thumb traced the groove obsessively.

They called his name. “Marris, Daniel.”

The procedure room was white. Clean. Inhuman. He sat down. The technician didn’t speak. The procedure lasted only a few minutes.

Then came the numbness.

Outside, the world looked the same.

But the air felt distant. The cold, unimportant.

Daniel gripped the worry stone again.

Nothing.

He stared at it, a deep and vibrant green, like her eyes. Turned it in his hand. No texture. No warmth.

He stood there on the payment clinic’s steps, watching the stone like it might speak, like it might cry out.

But it was silent.

Daniel didn’t cry. He didn’t scream.

The dread that had lived in his stomach was now the only thing he could feel.

A True Story of Transformation, Coaching, and Achieving Financial and Personal Freedom","I want to share one story about how Amy turned her life around. Her journey is a real example of what’s possible when you feel stuck and decide to make a change. If you’re feeling burned out or just trying to get through the week, maybe you’ll see a bit of yourself in her story.

\-------------------------------------

I want to share my story, not because I think it’s special, but because I know there are people out there who feel stuck, tired, or just plain worn out. Maybe you’re in the military, maybe you’re not, but if you’ve ever felt like you’re just trying to make it to Friday, this is for you.

A few years ago, I was at a breaking point. My husband and I were both in the Army. We had three kids. We were stationed at a fort, and he was deployed a lot. I was the head physician for a huge group of soldiers, and it was during COVID, so everything was even more intense. I was working six days a week, sometimes more. My husband was gone. The kids were home because daycare was closed. I’d leave microwave meals in the freezer and hope they’d be okay until I got home. I felt like I was failing as a parent, but I was also just trying to keep everyone afloat.

We had to start quitting things. The kids were in swim team, taekwondo, volleyball, but we couldn’t keep up. We dropped activities, and I felt guilty, but there was no other way. When my husband deployed, I was basically a single parent, and it was just survival mode. I remember thinking, “This isn’t sustainable. Something has to change.”

That’s when I reconnected with a friend who was a coach. We hadn’t talked in a while, but I reached out. I didn’t even know what I wanted. I just knew I couldn’t keep going like this. She asked me, “What’s your dream?” and I honestly didn’t have an answer. My dream was just to make it to Friday. That was it.

We did a strategy session, and she asked me to imagine what life could look like if I had time, freedom, health, and money to do what I wanted. I realized I hadn’t given myself permission to dream in a long time. I was just trying to get through each week. But I started to think about what I really wanted.

My husband and I had always planned to do twenty years in the Army, but we were both burned out. He was at nineteen years, I was at seventeen, and we decided it was time to start planning our exit. I wanted time and freedom. I wanted to get paid what I was worth. In the Army, it doesn’t matter how hard you work or what your job is, you get paid by your rank and years of service. I was working six days a week, doing a job that would pay a lot more in the civilian world, but I was just getting by.

I also wanted to stop moving for the job. For twenty years, we moved wherever the Army sent us. We had a sign on our wall that said, “Home is where the Army sends us.” But I wanted to live where we wanted to live, not where the job told us to go. I pictured a ranch-style house with windows on the water, a place where I could sit on the porch and have coffee in the morning, not rushing, just being.

Health was a big part of my vision too. I wanted to be healthier, not just physically, but mentally, emotionally, socially, and spiritually. I wanted to exercise in a way that felt good, eat real food, have time to cook, and be part of a community. I wanted to have real friendships, not just the kind you make because you’re in the same unit or trying to network. I wanted deep, authentic relationships.

I also wanted to work part-time in medicine. Medicine is a high-burnout field, and I didn’t want to jump from one burnout job to another. I wanted to serve my community, but I wanted to do it on my terms. I wanted to be time-rich, to have the freedom to do things I love, to be with my family, to support my kids’ dreams.

Money was part of it too. In the Army, you can get bonuses, but they come with strings attached. You sign up for more years, and then you’re stuck. I saw friends who signed up for four or six more years, and then two years in, they were desperate to get out but couldn’t. I decided not to sign another bonus. I didn’t want to be trapped.

Fast forward to now. It’s June 2025. I’m seven days away from retiring from the Army. We found our dream house, a ranch-style home on the water in Virginia. My retirement party is going to be in our backyard. It’ll probably just be me, my husband, the kids, and our new neighbors, but that’s perfect.

I got a part-time job at a children’s hospital, working six days a month. Not six days a week—six days a month. I also do some telemedicine from home. That means I have twenty-four days a month to do other things I love. One of those things is coaching. I got certified as a mental performance coach for athletes, and I’ve already coached over a dozen athletes, all remotely. I can do it from home, in my own space, on my own schedule.

My husband works remote now too. He’s building his dream office so his desk faces the water. We do a weekly date night, and we go for a walk together every morning. We’re working on building our prayer life together. Our relationships are richer, and we have time for each other.

Our daughter’s dream was to play college volleyball. She found her dream school, made the team, and her university is about forty minutes from our new house. We have the time and freedom to go to her games, to support her, to be there for her. We still have two kids at home, and we’re building a life that’s about more than just work.

We calendar the things that matter most. I don’t schedule work on game days. We say no to other things so we can be there for our kids. For years, I missed games and events because I said yes to the Army and no to my family. That’s in the past now.

Looking back, the turning point was giving myself permission to dream. I was at a low point, but I reached out for help. Coaching gave me structure and support. I still get coaching, and I have even bigger dreams now. I’m helping others achieve their goals too.

If you’re reading this and you feel stuck, I hope my story helps. You don’t have to stay where you are. It’s okay to want more. It’s okay to dream. Sometimes you just need someone to ask, “What’s your dream?” and give you permission to answer.

Thanks for reading.

This makes me think she might have some larger significance in the plot of this season, and imo this means her fate is going in 3 possible ways. 

1. She dies: Within the next episode or two. Quick and easy. This is the obvious possibility.

2. She disappears: we stop seeing her, only to see her again at the very end of the season having discovered that Vought has experimented on her. We know there's labs around the university which Vought uses, we saw the first scene of the season where full grown men were trying to administer V to themselves to give them powers. She could even end up as a unwilling bad guy of the season, having been tortured by Vought. 

3. She is kept alive. This is my main opinion on what will happen due to the time she's had on screen. I think at some point in the season, the supes on campus will start murdering the remaining humans left on campus and she will be protected by the main group or a side group like Harper and her room mate, that way we will get her view perspective of the situation going on.

One crucial thing I realised that note making and active recalling takes too much time.

So far, I’ve found only two tips that are actually practical:

1. Making theme-based notes.


2. Highlighting only the most important parts and revising those once or twice instead of trying to recall everything.



But I feel this isn’t enough. I’m looking for more realistic, time-efficient strategies. Rather than following generic topper advice blindly, I’d love to hear practical tips from those who have actually cleared the UPSC.

The agreement will remove import duties on 98.5% of EU goods exported to Indonesia and simplify procedures for entry for EU products including cars and food products such as milk powder, cheeses, meats, chocolates and bakery items, the EU said.

For the EU, the deal will result in savings of 600 million euros ($707.40 million) of duties averaging 10% a year on EU exports.

Indonesian goods will enjoy zero tariffs in 90% of the EU market upon implementation, the Indonesian economic ministry said, which should boost shipments for palm oil, coffee, textile and clothing and other products.

Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said he is aiming for the pact to enter into force on January 1, 2027.

Trade between Indonesia and the EU is expected to double in the first five years of implementation, Indonesia said.

Indonesia is in talks with European automakers on partnerships in battery and electric vehicle production in the Southeast Asian country, Airlangga told reporters.

*Knight and Paladins*: **The Devils by Joe Abercrombie**. A lot has already been said about this one - trite as it seems, nothing seems to describe it better than ""fantasy Suicide Squad"". I really liked the worldbuilding, and the bander simply worked for me, so I really enjoyed it. But those expecting something as narratively complex as the Age of Madness will probably be disappointed, Abercrombie clearly decided to write ""just"" a fun book (as if that's easy). 4/5.

*High Fashion*: **The Garments of Caean by Barrington J. Baylay**. Tough square for me, and I can't say I hugely enjoyed this one despite some interesting ideas. Character work was just ok, and there is quite a bit of 70s sexism. Still, it had a interesting ending, and I am a sucker for a book that concludes in a satisfying way - I can forgive many flaws if the book somehow sticks the landing in the end, and this one does, so it gets a 3/5.

*Impossible Places*: **Carl's Doomsday Scenario by Matt Dinniman**. One of the most prominent LitRPG series. I really enjoy the humor and the writing and Princess Donut and I have definitely turned into a fan, which is rare for me when it comes to a series that is already pretty long and will likely get longer. 4/5.

*Bookclub or Readalong*: **Lud-in-the-Mist by Hope Mirrlees**. There is a pretty extensive discussion about this one in the book club topic (I mean, duh), but I found the pacing rather plodding up until nearly the end, where is does pick up. Just like the **Garments of Caean**, this one manages to get an extra star from me because of an interesting ending. 3/5. 

*Parents*: **The Road by Cormac McCarthy**. Unsurprisingly controversial, as there are not many times that a book that many people find almost impossible to read, gets so much praise... but while I understand the naysayers, I am firmly in the camp. 80% of what is actually going on is a man and his young (7? 8?) son loading and unloading a cart with supplies, and making camp. The twist of course is, this is a post-apocalyptic world, and never has there been a more devastating depiction of the absolute dearth of resources the crumbling of civilization and the destruction of nature would bring. Of the despair, of the hoping against hope. Riveting. 4.5/5.

*Epistolary*: **The Unworthy by Agustina Bazzterica**. This is the kind of weird I really like. The memory recovery of the protagonist is not very convincing, but that's not the point of the book. Rather, it is an exploration of indoctrination and the sense of self, set against one of the weirdest cults a post-apocalyptic world could produce. 4/5.

*Published in 2025*: **Listen to your Sister by Neena Viel**.  A contemporary, weird horror novel, with an emphasis on weird. An exploration of family dynamics and the African-American experience, it is well-written and easy to read. But it just so happens it frequently mentions a couple of my personal ""icks"" when it comes to books, body horror with a dose of self-harm, and lots of shit. Actual shit, as in feces. Characters routinely step on it, fall on it, roll in it, and shit stains are all over the place. It actually lowered my enjoyment of an otherwise interesting book, so 3/5.

*Author of Color*: **House of Hunger by Alexis Henderson**. A gothic tale about vampires (though I am not sure if they are ever called so), sapphic lust, and lavish decadence, in a stately manor full of deadly secrets. I liked it. 3.5/5.

*Small Press or Self-Published*: **Jamaica Ginger and Other Conconctions by Nalo Hopkinson**. Like most short story collections, this one is uneven. Some great stories, some not interesting at all. I liked that the author prefaced each one. I must admit, the dialects and pronunciations are authentic, but I did have trouble understanding some of it. 3/5.

*LGTBQIA+ Protagonist*: **They Bloom At Night by Trang Tranh Tran**. Weird contemporary eco-horror, examining the search for identity against a backdrop of climate catastrophe. I honestly read it at the beginning of Bingo and I just don't recall that much about it, but my notes say 3/5, so... 3/5.

*Five Short Stories*: **The Best American Science Fiction And Fantasy 2023, edited by John Joseph Adams and R. F. Kuang**. Overall, I would expect the best to be a bit better. There are a few real gems, like ""The Six Deaths of the Saint"" by Alix E. Harrow and ""Rabbit Test"" by Samantha Mills, but most of it is good, but not great. 3/5.  

*Replace a Square*: *A Novel Adapted by Stage, Screen or Game. Hard Mode - Adapted by more than one medium*: **The Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham**. Another post-apocalypse, this one leaves the world intact but humans blind and vulnerable to predation by weird, mobile plants that were probably lab-grown for biological warfare and may or may not be sentient. The characters are rather thin and some of the plot doesn't bear close scrutiny, but the ideas and the vibes have consistently captured people's imagination - it was very successful back in the fifties and has movie, TV and radio adaptations. 3/5.

*Cozy SFF*: **Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi**. Interconnected short stories, around a particular coffee shop and a seat that can, under very strict rules, take you back in time, for as long as it takes for a cup of coffee to get cold - so, not long at all, and yet enough to bring people hope or closure. Some of the stories are fairly sad, and yet there is an undeniably hopeful, cozy vibe to it. 3/5.

*Not a Game*: **The Invincible by Starward Industries**. Videogame adaptation of the novel by Stanislaw Lem, my full review is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mlul9f/bingo_2025_review_not_a_book_the_invincible_video/).",4,1758631536.0,Fantasy,0,1.0,False

* **Price:** $15/month (better deals if you commit for longer)
* **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (strong coverage for US, UK, CA, FR)
* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (barely any buffering, even during US and UK primetime)
* **My experience:** I first heard about XXIPTV from a US-based [**iptv reseller** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_LPTV/wiki/index/)who swore by its NFL streams. After a few weeks, I was hooked—the connection held up during big UK soccer matches and US news broadcasts alike. The [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) made signing up painless, and the whole thing “just worked” on every device I threw at it.

# 2. [**IPTVMEZZY**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $16/month (with savings on longer plans)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (a giant library for US, UK, CA, FR, and more)
* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (very stable, but I noticed the rare buffer spike during major UK football)
* **My experience:** IPTVMEZZY came up in a Canadian online group, and I was impressed with the sheer volume of content. It’s easy to flip from a US sitcom to a French documentary, and the CA news lineup is surprisingly strong. Generally smooth, though I did hit a couple of lags during live European sports—nothing major, just the occasional refresh needed.

# 3. [**Aurorastreaming**](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially good for UK and FR, solid US/CA too)
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (great for movies and series, live UK sports can buffer on busy nights)
* **My experience:** Aurorastreaming was something of an underdog for me. Their classic French and British VOD selection is a hidden gem. Most streams ran smoothly, but a few live sporting events (especially UK rugby) did hiccup when everyone was tuned in.

# 4. [**OrbitBox IPTV**](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 19,000+ live, 58,000+ VOD (US/UK/CA focus, limited FR)
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (good for everyday viewing, but heavy sports nights can challenge it)
* **My experience:** OrbitBox IPTV is my “casual watching” pick—perfect for US morning shows, UK documentaries, or CA reality TV. French content is there, but not a highlight. Set-up for their [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) was quick, and the interface is easy even before my first coffee of the day.

# 5. NovaEdge Stream

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 16,000+ live, 46,000+ VOD (US/UK core, some CA/FR)
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening buffer is common, especially on big live events)
* **My experience:** NovaEdge Stream is my backup for background TV—like old US sitcoms or UK news while I’m cooking. Not my first choice for live sports or must-see events, but it’s reliable for casual use. Their [**iptv reseller**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) portal looked simple, but I didn’t dive into that side.

# My 2025 IPTV Takeaways

* **Don’t skip the best iptv trial**—it’s the only way to know if a provider fits your devices, habits, and region.
* Channel lists are impressive, but I only end up watching a handful of favorites. Focus on what *you* actually watch.
* Even [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) services can slow down during massive live events (especially in the US or UK).
* If you want to be an [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_Official_IPTV/wiki/index/), expect some tech support headaches with friends and family.
* A VPN is always a good idea—sometimes even improves streaming speeds.",21,1758631519.0,ToxicCoupleMemes,1,1.0,False

I'm far more comfortable chatting/meeting just one person at a time; easier to share and talk and connect! so not really looking for group social media or meets etc

Happy to chat for a bit, see if we get on and then meet up for whatever!

I'm open minded and easy going ! I just want to enjoy life, happy to meet anyone and talk about anything, we'll either vibe, or we wont! Age doesn't matter but please be at least 25 :) 

I like nail art AND skin care ( sporadically ^^' ), music (I'm always expanding and listening to whatever! my latest addition is k-pop thanks to k pop demon hunters! ) I game a little bit, but not much, my main fun things going out are for food or retail therapy !

1nog7s2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nog7s2,Ideas for bedside and work table walls,"Hey everyone,

I'm in the process of designing the bedroom I'll be moving into later this year and would love to get your ideas and opinions, especially on two specific walls.

**1. The Bed Wall (1st picture):**

The main challenge here is the wall to the left of the bed. It's a thermal wall that helps regulate the room's temperature. Because of this, I can't cover it with materials like wood paneling. My options are limited to treatments like wallpaper, paint, or hanging pictures. This is the wall I'm struggling with the most, and I'm looking for creative solutions that work within these constraints.

**2. The Workstation Wall (3rd picture):**

For this area, I want the wall to feel more complete and visually interesting. My current idea is to widen the vertical wood paneling and the shelves, but it still feels like it's missing a unique or ""quirky"" element.

A few planned changes for this side of the room:

* **The Desk:** I'll be replacing the desk legs. The current ones feel a bit heavy and oppressive, especially with the vertical lines on the wall. The tabletop shape will remain the same.
* **The Wardrobe:** It will likely have white and ""coffee"" colored details. I plan to use one section as a decorative niche, perhaps for a vase or other objects.
* **Adjacent Wall:** To tie things together, I'm considering adding a wood panel on the wall to the far left (partially visible in the 3rd picture) to match the other wood accents.

**A couple of layout notes:**

* The room is on the smaller side, so the bed has to stay in the corner. If I centered it, there wouldn't be enough space to move between the bed and the desk chair.
* There is a balcony behind the curtains, but the bed's current position is necessary and already covers part of the access.

I'm new to this, so any and all ideas are welcome! Thanks in advance.",1,1758631020.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

The sun slipped through my curtains far too early today, but I didn’t mind. I stretched, smiled, and checked my messages. A few eager boys had already sent their “good morning tributes.” Imagine waking up and the first thought in your head being me. Delicious.

One, however, disappointed me. He wrote paragraphs of excuses instead of sending what I deserve. His name sits in my diary, but barely. I drew a thin line through it as I sipped my coffee. Almost erased, but not quite. I’ll decide later if he survives another day.

As for the others… they’ve bought themselves the privilege of being remembered. Every dollar is ink on my page. Every offering is proof that I’m worth more than their comfort.

The day has only just begun, and already the balance tips in my favor.

1nog3jt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nog3jt,Solo Trip to New Mexico,"TL;DR / This was my first time in New Mexico. I visited the Valles Caldera, Santa Fe Ntl. Forest, McCauley Warm Springs, Carson Natl. Forest, and Black Rock Hot Springs. I was astounded by the diversity of the landscape here and how much some parts reminded me of West Texas. I’d never seen anything like the burn scars in the Jemez area. I also learned that high elevation affects me; I had to catch my breath much too often on this trip. I had an incredible time!

Disclaimer: I had originally posted this on /camping, and someone accused me of using Ai. I spent days writing and perfecting this trip report, I hope this sub can appreciate it :’)

———

In the beginnings of New Mexico from Texas, small shrubs dotted flat land to my right and left. Shy yellow wildflowers peeked through tall, shimmery grass. Looking ahead, blue-grey gradients on the horizon proved higher ground wasn't far.

Plains became hills, and more greenery showed.

The hills grew larger, and I was in their valleys. The green was vibrant and red-brown dirt was visible in its negative space.

Getting higher, the formations around me became bald. Creamsicle rock created peaks against the cloudless sky. Still, a scatter of piñon covered the skirt of them.

After a longer stretch, I was closer to the clouds. Grassy slopes boasting bunches of rabbitbrush and purple aster were the foreground for tall, amber-barked ponderosas. In the distance, burn scars along the mountaintops contrasted the life around them.

Following the Jemez River through sun-bleached pastures, once sparse conifers soon became forests surrounding wide valleys. Dense patches of trees with old, drooping foliage made shade in the harsh middle-day. Newer, shining pines were sprouting from the ground. The stream glittered with the sun. It didn’t narrow, or widen, and it seemed to never end.

I settled for the night on a soft pine needle floor adorned with cones.

Waking to the crack of the forest floor and scattering wildlife feet, my breath touched the air around me and showed. I quickly bundled myself and brewed coffee with cream. A steam cloud rose over my campsite. Orangey morning sun peeked through the tree-blinds, over the hillside, and shone into my face. Quietness remained beside birdsong and the sip of my mug.

With a heavy pack in tow, and layers of warmth, I walked through vanilla woods. The forest was showered in velvety morning sun; glossy leaves at my feet reflected a hot white light. For miles, I sang to myself, and I thanked the forest for her beauty. I told her how grateful I was to smell her scents and to feel her breeze.

The hike became tough, and I persisted through rocky, steep trails. Wool and cotton were packed away as the sun warmed me. Coming upon a stream that I heard before seeing, I followed it skyward.

There, in the hollow, two pools of clear water were fed by a warm, bubbling spring. The first was shallow and cascaded down by waterfall into the next. Terraced below, a deeper bath sparkled with the sun. Tall, purple-white flowers pushed through grassy patches that embellished its borders. Mountain peaks stretched for miles ahead. I cried and repeated to the forest how beautiful she was.

I soaked in the soft spring water. I showered in the sunlight. I laid on the tree roots. I was barefoot on pillows of fallen pine needles. I breathed in the incense of the trees, and the earthiness of the dirt. I stayed until my hair had been wet and dry 3 times over.

Traveling through the high desert, along the Rio Grande, walls of maroon boulders crowned by juniper savannahs made an impressive show of color. Deep purple stone, khaki pathways, and many shades of green: ashy sage brush, evergreen juniper, river water. And, again, the bouquets of yellow wildflowers- like colored buttons or stitching on an otherwise bland blouse.

Just before sunset, my shelter was made atop these heights with a sweeping view of the gorge. The sun hid as I sat on its edge and admired the glittering ribbon of water below. By dark, supper was heating on a snapping fire. I bathed in its warmth and thought of tomorrow. A cigarette was rolled. Under the new moon, hidden stars shone, and the milky way glowed viridescent behind my plumes of smoke.

Cozy in wool, a late morning brought an unforgiving sun. The short, shrubby trees of the area provided no respite. I got up with promises of another soak and packed in a hurry.

Silvery sage meadows covered the fields around me and reflected the morning heat in every direction. I walked through farmland. Black cows lounged near the fence line of healthy pastures ornamented by a backdrop of the range. Modest, tan houses sat on their ranches. A bit further, and I was now face to face with the canyon- and the big purple boulders I had marveled at before.

A short descent of the rocky hillside left new scrapes on my boots. Hidden from the bend, three pools of different depths sat next to the calm Rio Grande. Steam rose off shimmering black water. Despite my lateness, everyone else was just as such. I had the hot spring to myself. I floated and sighed for my last moments in the state.

On my departure, the sky became dull, and raindrops fell one at a time at first, and then with no mercy. Serpentine roads revealed a tarot of fall colors. Yellowing leaves and red bushes were hard to miss against nature’s blanket of green. Before long, oak, mesquites, and cedar fences framed my route. The air was thick and warm. I had reached familiar Texas plains by dusk. ­",59,1758630693.0,womensolocamping,5,1.0,False
1nog270,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nog270,"Rusted burrs, am I cooked? [Eureka Atom 65]","So, I got a nice Eureka Prima E1 on the second hand market, so far so good: I even thought I lucked out because it was going for cheap (was mislabeled as an ECM grinder, but I recognized the look of the Atom so I dug a bit, and lo and behold: the Prima E1 is a special edition rebranded Eureka Atom 65 that was sold as a combo with the Victoria Arduino E1 Prima machine a couple of years ago).

Very happy with it, except that the grinder seems to have gone through hands that didn't know anything about espresso and all... So when I opened it to look at the burrs, I found some moldy coffee in the grind chamber, and that the burrs seemingly had rusted (I assume the reseller tried to clean the grinder and used a wet cloth or so.)

So I cleaned it all, ground some coffee, cleaned it more and here's what the burrs are looking like now.

My question is: how cooked am I? How bad can some rust be on these metal burrs? I'd be tempted to sandblast them, since a friend has a sandblaster, but my understanding of burrs is that they have some sort of coating? What's the purpose of that coating?

I wasn't really planning to hop on the burrs collector train, especially as I believe the Eureka Atom 65 only fits Eureka burrs, but not the SSP ones, or other fancy aftermarket ones, no?

Nothing fancy, just photos of latte art, some behind‑the‑scenes shots, and the occasional meme about caffeine addiction. It's been fun to post, but the growth is sloooow. Right now it's basically my family, a couple of friends, and one very loyal customer.

I've read about all the ""strategies"" (boosted posts, inviting everyone in your contacts, giveaways, collabs, etc.), but I haven't really committed to anything yet. I don't want to be that person constantly begging for likes, and I'd rather avoid the kind of low‑effort engagement bait that clogs up feeds. I actually saw a site called SocialFluffer, and the reviews were really good, and I might try this.

So I'm curious, if you've managed to get traction on a small page, what actually worked for you? Did you run tiny ad tests, share posts in local groups, or lean on cross‑platform stuff like ig or tiktok? I've been experimenting with reels a bit, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to grow organically.

I'm fine with slow and steady, I just want the page to feel alive instead of stuck in ""family + 12 friends"" mode. Any little tips, timing, post types, captions that don't feel cringe, would be super helpful.",3,1758630576.0,socialmedia,2,0.81,False

Alright, let’s talk. If you're anything like me - juggling lectures, part-time gigs, and pretending to read assigned readings - you've definitely thought about getting a little help with your papers. I mean, we’ve all seen those ads, Reddit threads, or even overheard someone in class saying, “Yo, I just used SpeedyPaper for that history essay.”

That’s basically what happened to me. My roommate (who never starts his papers before 1 a.m., absolute menace) swore by SpeedyPaper. Then a classmate mentioned using EssayMarket for her sociology project, and I kept seeing WritePaperForMe pop up on TikTok and Reddit. So, being the curious soul that I am — and also, let’s be honest, tired - I decided to run a little experiment and actually test all three.

Yup, I placed real orders on each platform. Here’s what went down.

**SITE LINKS:**

* [**SpeedyPaper**](https://essay.watch/LpjbZL?type=47)
* [**EssayMarket**](https://essay.watch/3ZGbCG?type=52)
* [**WritePaperForMe**](https://essay.watch/pxZTtS?type=57)

# The Breakdown: Topics, Deadlines, Prices & Talking to Support

🕵️‍♂️ What I Ordered

* SpeedyPaper: Asked for a 5-page argumentative essay on AI ethics, 5-day deadline.
* EssayMarket: Went with a 3-page business case study, 3-day deadline.
* WritePaperForMe: Ordered a 2-page literature analysis on Shakespeare, 24-hour deadline.

💸 Prices

* SpeedyPaper: Around $70 — decent for 5 pages and some solid research.
* EssayMarket: This one works differently — you post your task and get bids from writers. I got offers ranging from $25 to $60 and picked one in the middle.
* WritePaperForMe: $40 for a quick turnaround. Honestly, fair for the rush.

Not crazy cheap, but not robbery either. It’s college — coffee and assignments are overpriced by default.

💬 Support Vibes

* SpeedyPaper: Super responsive. Got replies in like 10 minutes max. Even asked if I needed help choosing a topic.
* EssayMarket: More like a freelancer platform, so you’re mostly dealing with the writer directly. Hit or miss depending on who you pick.
* WritePaperForMe: Slick chat system. Not 24/7 (or at least not super fast late at night), but helpful and polite.

Bonus points to SpeedyPaper for not making me feel dumb when I asked about formatting.

# The Results: Quality, Accuracy, and If They’re Actually Worth the Hype

[SpeedyPaper](https://essay.watch/LpjbZL?type=47) Review

Not gonna lie - I was impressed with the structure. The writer followed the outline I uploaded, included proper MLA formatting, and the sources were legit. No weird citations from blogs or sketchy websites. Grammarly said 96/100 on clarity. Plus, the tone was academic but not robotic. Big win.

[EssayMarket](https://essay.watch/3ZGbCG?type=52) Review

So here’s the thing: since you pick the writer, it really depends who you choose. Mine was okay. The analysis was fine, not groundbreaking. But it hit the points I asked for and came with decent references. Just triple-check the final version - I had to fix a couple of grammar slips.

[WritePaperForMe](https://essay.watch/pxZTtS?type=57) Review

Honestly, for a 24-hour turnaround, this one surprised me. Not flawless, but the paper came with citations, good paragraph flow, and a clear thesis. Also, it passed Turnitin with flying colors (yes, I checked - I don’t mess with plagiarism). Fast service, did what I asked, and didn’t give AI-generated vibes.

# Final Thoughts & Advice: Choosing a Writing Service That Doesn’t Suck

If you’ve ever opened a blank Google Doc at 2 a.m. and considered switching majors just to avoid writing another paper - yeah, I see you.

Here's the deal:

1. SpeedyPaper felt the most professional overall. Great structure, good communication, decent price.
2. EssayMarket is more DIY - can be hit or miss, but if you’re picky about writers, it might work well.
3. WritePaperForMe is great for last-minute situations. Delivered fast and didn’t skimp on content.

If you’re gonna spend money on academic help, don’t gamble on sketchy sites or Reddit DM offers. Stick with services that let you talk to support, have clear pricing, and offer real samples.

Like Warren Buffett once said, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” I think that applies here big time. You’re not just buying words - you’re buying time, energy, and maybe even a decent grade.

# TL;DR - Which One’s for You?

I wanted to ask, from those of you that have already been living there for a while, even your whole life, what if anything do you miss?

I don't know for example how or where to check what the NHS services are like, or even what acccess is there to any private specialist clinics (think of gynecologist, menopause, physiotherapy, that kind of thing). 

I also don't really know how the local communities are like. If any of you is in the LGBTQ community, a bit nerdy (DnD), and such, do you find community around and opportunities to meet other like-minded people? If you aren't from the area, have you find people are welcoming? Have you found it easy to just go to a coffee shop or a small shop and talk to people? That kind of thing.

Instead of buying multiple pairs for different occasions, you can style **one versatile pair** in a variety of ways to suit casual, work, and party looks. Here’s how you can mix, match, and shine with Walkaroo shoes.

**1. Casual Day Out: Effortless Comfort Meets Style**

For a laid-back weekend or a casual outing, pair your Walkaroo shoes with **denim jeans, a comfy T-shirt, and a light jacket**. Walkaroo’s ergonomic soles make sure your feet stay comfortable while you stroll around town or grab coffee with friends. Add a tote bag and minimal accessories for an easy, everyday chic vibe.

**Tip:** Stick to neutral-colored Walkaroo shoes like beige, white, or black for maximum versatility with casual outfits.

**2. Office Ready: Smart, Sleek, and Professional**

Transform the same pair into an office-appropriate look by pairing them with **tailored trousers, a crisp blouse, or a smart shirt**. If your Walkaroo shoes have subtle embellishments, they can act as the perfect accessory to elevate your professional attire without overpowering it. Finish the look with a structured handbag and delicate jewelry.

**Tip:** Neutral shades work best for office wear, but metallic or muted pastel tones can add a subtle, stylish edge.

**3. Evening Glam: Shine for the Night**

Who says you need a new pair for a night out? Your Walkaroo shoes can easily complement **dresses, skirts, or chic jumpsuits**. Pair them with statement earrings or a clutch to add a touch of glamour. Walkaroo’s stylish designs ensure you not only look good but stay comfortable, so you can dance the night away!

**Tip:** Shoes with a slight heel or embellishments can easily transition from day to night, making them ideal for parties and dinners.

**4. Weekend Brunch or Shopping Spree**

Pair your Walkaroo shoes with a **flowy midi dress or a casual skirt and top combo** for brunch with friends or a shopping day. The lightweight design ensures comfort during long walks, while the stylish silhouette adds a polished finish to your casual chic look.

**Tip:** Experiment with patterns and textures in your outfit – a solid-colored Walkaroo shoe pairs beautifully with floral or striped dresses.

**5. Travel-Friendly Footwear**

Planning a trip? One pair of Walkaroo shoes can be your **all-in-one travel companion**. Pair them with leggings and oversized shirts for airport comfort, and then switch to a casual dress for sightseeing. Walkaroo’s sturdy design ensures durability for long walks while maintaining style wherever you go.

**Tip:** Choose neutral tones or classic colors for travel to match multiple outfits effortlessly.

**Final Thoughts: One Pair, Endless Possibilities**

Investing in a versatile pair of Walkaroo shoes isn’t just practical; it’s smart style. With the right outfit combinations, your Walkaroo shoes can take you from a casual day out to a glamorous evening, making every step a statement. So next time you’re dressing up, remember – **mix, match, and shine** with just one pair of Walkaroo shoes!",1,1758629662.0,u_Big_Platypus8664,0,1.0,False

1nofq15,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nofq15/i_tuned_into_a_haunted_number_station_it_knew_my/,I Tuned Into a Haunted Number Station... It Knew My Name!,"Since I was thirteen, I've been obsessed with what most people ignore. Not ghosts. Not little green men. Something older. Quieter. Radio waves. Invisible threads humming through the air 24/7. Passing through walls. Through bodies. Through us.

While most people moved on to cable, CDs, and the internet, I stayed up late with a beat-up shortwave receiver. Tuning knobs. Chasing ghosts made of static.

My name is James Brooks. I'm in my early forties. I've worked in comms my whole life. I live alone, just outside town. I run diagnostics and comms repairs for a small contractor... and listen by night.

Because shortwave isn't normal radio. It's global. It bounces off the sky itself. And sometimes—just sometimes—it bounces back something you're not supposed to hear.

I've picked up signals from Taiwan. Fishing chatter from Norway. Once, even a burst of coded gibberish that chilled me to the bone. But the weirdest of all? The numbers stations.

Calm voices. Female. Robotic. Sometimes... children. Reciting sequences of numbers. No music. No intro. Just ""Seven... four... one... three... zero..."" Again. And again.

Nobody knows who runs them. Cold War leftovers? Spy networks? Or... something worse?

At first, I thought I was just listening. Until one night... one of them spoke my name.

It started on a Wednesday night. The air in my apartment felt heavier than usual. Still. Like something was waiting.

I'd been scanning for over an hour. Static, fragments of foreign weather reports, occasional amateur ham conversations—nothing unusual. I was about to shut everything off, go to bed.

Then I heard her.

""Seven... three... two... two... eight. Repeat. Seven... three... two... two... eight.""

A child's voice. Calm. Rhythmic. Emotionless. It cut straight through the noise—like it didn't belong in the same frequency range. Like it was riding something underneath the signal.

I froze. Reached for my phone. Hit record. My hands were trembling just a little.

The voice went on for nearly two minutes. Repeating the same five digits. Then—nothing. Static again.

I sat there in the dark, headphones still on, trying to process what I'd just heard. Something about it felt... wrong. Not fake. Not paranormal. But personal.

I uploaded the clip to an old shortwave forum I'd used for years with a quick caption: ""Weird numbers station tonight. Child's voice repeating 73228. Frequency 6925 kHz. Anyone else?""

Then I shut everything down and climbed into bed. Didn't sleep well. My dreams were full of static. Whispers. Endless digits floating in blackness.

Next morning, I woke to a flood of notifications. My post had blown up overnight. Comments poured in: ""Dude, I caught something like this last month. Same frequency. Different voice. Different number."" ""Are you sure it wasn't a pirate station?""

And then one comment caught my attention. Simple. Direct.

SilentWhisper7: ""You shouldn't be listening to this.""

I stared at the screen for a long time. Something about that username... the way they phrased it... It didn't feel like trolling.

I replied, asking what they meant. No response.

That night, I sat back down at my radio. Same time. Same setup. Heart beating just a bit faster.

For a while—nothing. The same dead static, the soft hiss in my headphones.

Then the signal returned. Same voice. Same pattern. But something had changed. The tone. The rhythm. It sounded... closer.

""Four... seven... two... James. Repeat. Four... seven... two... James.""

I froze. My blood ran cold. It said my name.

I ripped the headphones off. For a full minute, I just sat there, staring at the floor. Heart hammering. Mouth dry.

Eventually, I hit replay on my phone recording. Just in case I'd misheard. Nope. The voice was clear. Unmistakable. ""James.""

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe someone online saw my post and spoofed the broadcast. But how would they know when I'd be listening? How would they hijack a frequency like that?

Was it a coincidence? Auditory pareidolia? A trick of my own tired mind?

I wanted to believe that. But deep down, I knew better.

I posted again. Urgent. Desperate. ""I just heard my name broadcast on 6925. Has this happened to anyone else? Please tell me I'm not crazy.""

Some comments mocked me. Some suggested stress, sleep deprivation. One even said I was chasing clout.

But a few took me seriously. Some described hearing their names in other sequences. Others claimed to have been hearing whispers long after turning off their radios.

One comment from SilentWhisper7 came again, this time private: ""These aren't just numbers. They're sequences. Personalized. You've been marked. Stop listening—before it's too late.""

No explanation. No context. Just that.

And still... I didn't stop.

The next night, I listened again. I told myself I wouldn't. I told myself I needed sleep. But the static was calling me.

There's something about numbers stations—once you hear them, really hear them—they pull at you.

And sure enough... she came back. Not right away. Almost like she was waiting.

Then—clear, deliberate, cold: ""Four... seven... two... James."" Again. Again. Always the same.

Like she knew I was there. Like she was looking at me through the frequency.

I didn't record this one. Couldn't bring myself to move. I just sat. Listening. Shaking.

And when it ended... the silence didn't feel like silence anymore. It felt like she was still there.

I didn't sleep at all that night. I kept the lights on. I paced the apartment. Every shadow looked heavier. Every creak in the floor made me flinch.

I even unplugged the radio. But it didn't help. Because sometime around 4 A.M., I thought I heard it again.

No headphones. No signal. Just... whispers. Barely audible. Coming from behind the walls. Numbers. Slow. Measured. Like someone was speaking directly into the wiring.

The next day I tried to act normal. I went to work. Talked to customers. Sold two routers and a surge protector.

But I was fraying at the edges. Like my skin didn't fit right anymore.

When I got home that night, I didn't even touch the radio. Didn't open Reddit. Didn't look at anything that might spark it again.

But then, around midnight, I got another message. SilentWhisper7. No greeting. No explanation. ""Did you hear them without the radio? If yes, they've already marked you. You need to leave. Now.""

That was it.

I grabbed my keys and drove straight to my friend Alex's apartment. He was the only person I could really trust with something this weird.

Alex and I had been friends since high school. He was a skeptic by nature. Grounded. Rational. Exactly the kind of person I needed.

He met me at the door, half-asleep but concerned. Let me inside. Made coffee.

I told him everything. Every detail. The voice. The number. My name. The whispers.

He listened without interrupting, which was rare for him. When I finally finished, he just stared into his cup and said, ""Okay... I don't know if I believe all of it. But I do believe that you believe it. And that's enough for me.""

I stayed on his couch that night. Didn't sleep much, but I felt safer with someone nearby.

At least until 3:17 A.M. That's when Alex's old clock radio—unplugged—clicked on.

Just static at first. Then a voice. Male this time. Familiar.

""Six... one... nine... three... Alex.""

His name.

Alex bolted upright on the couch across from me. We locked eyes, neither of us speaking.

Then the voice repeated it. ""Six... one... nine... three... Alex.""

He jumped up and yanked the cord from the wall—again. Even though it wasn't plugged in.

The voice cut out. The silence that followed was unbearable.

That was the turning point. Alex didn't think I was crazy anymore.

He didn't go to work the next day. Didn't turn on his phone. We sat at his kitchen table for hours, trying to make sense of it.

His only question was, ""Why us?""

We spent that afternoon digging deep—forums, old posts, archived threads, conspiracy sites. Most of it was garbage. Fake stories. ARGs. Troll bait.

But a few entries stood out. People describing stations that said their names. Or that whispered when no radios were on.

One post ended with: ""It's not a broadcast. It's a transmission vector.""

That phrase stuck with me.

That night, I returned home to grab a few essentials. Clothes. My backup drive. A hard copy of frequencies I'd logged over the years.

The apartment felt... contaminated. I moved quickly. Tried not to look at the radio still sitting on my desk.

But just as I zipped up my bag—it turned on. By itself. No power. No antenna. Just static.

Then the voice. ""Four... seven... two... James. Broadcast begins.""

I grabbed the radio, heart pounding, and ripped it off the desk. Threw it against the wall. It cracked, sparked, and fell silent.

Five seconds later... I heard the voice again. Not from the radio. From my phone speaker. It had turned on its own recorder. Somehow. And it was playing the exact same voice back to me in real time.

I left the apartment. Didn't lock the door. Didn't look back.

When I got to Alex's, I told him everything. He didn't laugh. Didn't question it. He just asked, ""What if it's not a station anymore? What if it's inside the devices now?""

I didn't have an answer.

Around 2 A.M., we both passed out from sheer exhaustion.

I woke up to find Alex gone. His phone still on the table. Coffee half-full.

His clock radio was buzzing—on again. And his voice was coming from it.

""Three... three... one... five... James... Repeat. Three... three... one... five... James...""

I turned it off. Unplugged it. Smashed it. Still... the voice didn't stop. It moved to the speakers in the kitchen. Then the TV—off, but whispering. Same message. Same tone. Same impossible logic.

That was the last time I saw Alex. He never came back. His phone's GPS stopped updating. His Reddit account was deleted the next day.

All that remained was his voice, now part of the signal.

After Alex vanished, I didn't go home again. I bounced between motels. Used cash. Turned off my phone. No electronics, no screens, no radios.

Didn't matter. The voices followed anyway. They no longer waited for signals or wires. They came in silence. In dreams. In the spaces between breaths.

I stopped trying to explain it to people. Because how do you explain that you're being followed by... a frequency? That your best friend's voice now lives in the static? That numbers... can haunt?

And then, SilentWhisper7 messaged me again. This time with coordinates. A remote spot outside the city. No explanation. Just: ""If you want answers—come alone.""

I went. What else was I going to do?

I found an abandoned farmhouse, half-collapsed, with a rusted satellite dish in the backyard. Inside, it was dark, silent, except for the soft hiss of old equipment still humming.

He was already there. Middle-aged. Gaunt. Sunken eyes. Unshaved. Like someone who hadn't slept in weeks—or months.

""You're James,"" he said. Not a question.

I nodded. He motioned for me to sit. I did.

He didn't waste time. ""They call it Voice 472,"" he said. ""We don't know who built it. Or why. But it's older than it should be. Some of the tech in there predates public shortwave transmission.""

I asked what it was.

He looked me dead in the eye. ""It's not a station. It's a signal vector. An infection. You don't listen to it. It listens to you.""

He explained that the sequences weren't just code. They were activation phrases. Once your sequence is spoken—and you hear it—something connects. Something opens. You're no longer just a listener. You become part of the broadcast.

I asked him if there was any way to stop it.

He handed me a USB stick. ""On here,"" he said, ""are reversed signal pulses. Early countermeasures. They can confuse the frequency. Disrupt it. Temporarily.""

""But not destroy it?""

""No,"" he said. ""You can't destroy a voice that isn't speaking.""

That night, in a motel room off Highway 73, I played the reversed signals through headphones. The effect was immediate. My nose bled. I blacked out for maybe twenty seconds.

But when I came to—the voices were gone. For the first time in weeks... silence. True silence.

I thought it was over. But I was wrong.

It was never about stopping the voices. It was about finishing the sequence.

At 3:00 A.M., my motel TV flickered on. On its own. Black screen. Green text blinking: ""SUBJECT 472 STREAM COMPLETE.""

Then the voice: ""New node identified. Subject... four... seven... three... Ready.""

A pause. Then, softly—right next to my ear: ""Are you listening?""

It was the radio in the motel's room. I smashed the radio. Tore the wires out with my bare hands and hurled the remains against the wall. Plastic cracked. The speaker sparked. Silence.

But the silence didn't last.

That night, as I tried to sleep, I heard it again. No headphones. No devices. Nothing plugged in. Just the darkness... and the voice.

""Four... seven... two... James. Repeat. Four... seven... two... James.""

I sat up in bed, shaking. My ears weren't ringing—they were receiving.

The next morning, I threw what was left of the radio into a dumpster three blocks away. Then I unplugged everything. Laptop. Router. Even my microwave.

Didn't help. Because the whispering wasn't in the wires anymore. It was in the quiet. In the space behind my thoughts. Between breaths.

When the world went still... the numbers came. ""Four... seven... two... James...""

That night, I returned to Alex's place. I didn't even have to explain. He opened the door, eyes hollow, and just said, ""I've been hearing it too.""

We sat in silence for a while. Then he told me everything.

It started last night. ""I thought I dreamt it—just static at first. Then I heard a voice. Six... one... nine... three... Alex. Repeating it. Calm. Like it knew I was listening.""

His voice shook. ""Then my phone glitched. The flashlight turned on by itself. And I saw something written on the screen...""

He took a shaky breath. ""NEW NODE IDENTIFIED.""

That was the moment we both knew this wasn't paranoia. It was happening. And now it was spreading.

Later that night, I found Alex standing in the kitchen. Faucet running. Hands trembling. Mouthing something over and over: ""Six... one... nine... three... Six... one... nine... three...""

I called his name. No answer. His eyes were glassy. Unblinking.

Then suddenly—he blinked. Looked at me like I'd just appeared out of nowhere. ""James... I think I need to go.""

""Go where?""

""I don't know. I just know I can't stay. It's too loud in here. Even when it's quiet.""

He grabbed his jacket and walked out the door. Didn't take his phone. Didn't say goodbye.

That was the last time I saw him.

I waited. An hour. Then two. I texted. Called. Nothing.

By morning, Alex's phone had been deactivated. No last location. No posts. His apartment? Empty. Drawers untouched. Bed made. Coffee mug still warm.

It was like he'd never come home—or never existed.

That afternoon, I got another message from SilentWhisper7. Short. Cold. ""He heard the full sequence. He's inside now. Don't follow.""

Attached was an audio file. I almost deleted it. But something in me... needed to know.

I put on headphones. Pressed play.

Silence. Then static. Then... Alex's voice. ""Three... three... one... five... James... Repeat. Three... three... one... five...""

I ripped the headphones off. Fell backward out of my chair.

He wasn't speaking to me. He was broadcasting.

After that, things spiraled fast. I started seeing numbers everywhere. Not just 472. Not just 6193. New ones. Spray-painted on alley walls. Scrawled on receipts. Burned into my dreams.

Every sequence ended the same way: my name.

I tried to get help. Doctors said I was sleep-deprived. Paranoid. Maybe schizophrenic. They gave me pills. None of them worked.

Because this wasn't in my head. It was in the air.

One night, I came home to find my laptop open. I hadn't touched it in days. The screen showed nothing but code. Endless strings of numbers scrolling like a terminal.

Then a flicker. The cursor blinked. A single phrase appeared: ""SEQUENCE ACCEPTED.""

My speakers turned on. No music. No voice. Just breathing.

That was the moment I knew it was inside everything. The signal had spread. Through phones. Through Wi-Fi. Through us.

Alex hadn't disappeared. He'd been absorbed. Transmitted.

And I was next.

I started writing everything down. Not just what I heard—but what I felt. The dreams. The numbers. The growing sense that something was watching me from inside the static.

I posted pieces of it anonymously online. Deep forums. Old numbers station threads. Some laughed. Some said I was trying too hard to revive old creepypastas.

But one user messaged me directly. Not SilentWhisper7. Someone new. NullSyntax0.

The message said: ""You've gone past the threshold. You're already part of the signal. But you can stall it. If you want out, you need to transmit back.""

That phrase stuck in my mind. Transmit... back.

I didn't know what it meant. But it felt like a thread worth pulling.

So I started researching broadcast theory again. Shortwave reflection. Feedback loops. Pulse disruption.

Then one night, deep in a Russian telecom archive—I found something. A declassified note from the early 90s. Scanned. Blurry.

It referenced an anomalous transmission that caused hallucinations in signal operators. Exposure lasting over 3 minutes led to identity disruption, memory loss, and eventually—signal compliance.

There was a codename: Voice 472.

The note ended with a chilling line: ""Do not allow subject to hear their own sequence reversed. This initiates a feedback collapse.""

That same night, I received a new file from SilentWhisper7. No message. Just an .mp3 titled ""return472rev.wav.""

I didn't open it. Not right away. I stared at the filename for hours.

Then I copied it to a flash drive, packed a bag, and left town. No phone. No electronics except an old analog player with physical buttons and no Wi-Fi.

I drove until the gas tank blinked red. Found a cheap roadside motel with stained curtains and no security cameras. Checked in under a fake name.

Sat on the bed. Plugged in my headphones. And pressed play.

The sound was... wrong. Not just distorted—bent. It didn't play like a normal reversed audio clip. It pulsed. Like a heartbeat. Like breath. Like something was inside it, crawling through the file.

At first, it was just reversed static. Then came the numbers. Backwards. But still... recognizable. ""Sev... en... two... four...""

My fingers clenched. It was my sequence—just inverted.

Then, faintly, buried under the layers of noise—my voice. Not a recording. Me. Saying things I've never said. ""We listen to remember. We transmit to belong.""

I yanked the headphones off, heart pounding. The motel room spun. I felt dizzy. Unstable. Like my body was trying to reject something that had already gotten in.

The next morning, I couldn't find the file on the flash drive. Gone. No trace. Even the filename had vanished from the system log.

The motel's TV screen was blinking. Unplugged, of course. A green cursor blinked at the bottom corner. A phrase scrolled by—slowly, letter by letter: ""Return signal acknowledged. Collapse delayed.""

Then, suddenly: ""New target sequence 473.""

I stared at the number. It didn't register at first. Then... it clicked. 473 wasn't mine. It wasn't Alex's. It was... next.

I packed up. Left immediately. Drove without music. Without sound. Just the hum of tires and my own heartbeat.

But the silence wasn't silent anymore. It never was. Every quiet moment now carried static underneath it. Like the world had tuned itself slightly off-frequency.

I pulled over at a rest stop just after dark. There was a man standing under the flickering light of a vending machine. Thin. Pale. Eyes like he hadn't slept in years.

I almost kept walking. But then he turned to me and said, ""You heard it, didn't you? Voice 472.""

I froze. He smiled. Not kindly. ""You should've let it pass through. You shouldn't have responded.""

I asked him what it wanted.

He shrugged. ""It doesn't want. It collects. And when you reply... it begins cataloging.""

""Cataloging what?""

""Your mind. Your rhythm. Your internal signal. So it can reproduce you.""

That night I slept in my car, far from lights. Far from power lines. I left the radio off. Left my phone in the glovebox.

Didn't matter. I dreamed anyway.

In the dream, I was standing in front of an old screen. Green text scrolled endlessly: ""Signal received. Subject 472 Replica initiated... Replica initiated... Replica...""

And then it stopped. The last line read: ""Next 473.""

I woke up at sunrise, shaking. Checked the windows. Checked my reflection. Still me.

But something felt off. Not wrong—just... copied. Like I was remembering how to be James Brooks instead of being him.

I drove for hours with no destination. Some part of me knew that staying still would only let it catch up. If it hadn't already.

Road signs blurred by. Gas stations. Empty fields. All of them strangely quiet—like the whole world was holding its breath.

Eventually, I pulled into a dusty roadside diner. No customers. One old man behind the counter. He didn't greet me. Didn't even blink. Just stared.

I sat down. Ordered coffee. When he returned with the mug, he placed something beside it: a small, tape-labeled cassette. Scrawled in shaky handwriting: ""Do Not Listen.""

I looked up at him. ""What is this?""

He didn't answer. Just turned and walked away.

I left without touching the tape. But I took it with me. That was my mistake.

Two hours later, inside another motel room, I held the cassette in my hand. Thought about burning it. Breaking it.

Instead, I slid it into an old Walkman I bought at a pawn shop.

The second I pressed play—the room darkened. Not literally. It just felt darker. Like something leaned in. Breathing.

The voice that came through was not a child's. Not male or female. It wasn't human.

""You are sequence. You are noise. You are now within the pattern.""

I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. The voice changed. Became distorted—until it sounded like me. Talking to myself from inside the recording.

""This is James Brooks. Sequence 472. Logging final report... before replacement.""

I dropped the Walkman. It hissed. Then it whispered: ""New pattern stabilizing. Next 473. Awaiting confirmation.""

The lights flickered. The mirror cracked down the center. And for a split second—I saw myself standing on the other side.

But not me. Older. Emptier. Hollow eyes. Mouth moving in sync with the voice.

I ran. Got in the car. Didn't look back.

But every time I blinked—I still saw the number. 473. Burned into my vision like a screen left on too long.

Now I know I don't have much time left. The signal's not just tracking me. It's building me. Echoing me. Recreating me inside itself.

And when it's done... I won't be the one listening anymore. I'll be the one transmitting.

I used to think I could fight it. Shut off the radios. Smash the speakers. Delete the files. Move somewhere off-grid, off-signal, off-frequency.

But it doesn't work like that. The transmission never needed hardware. It used it—yes. But only as scaffolding. Temporary vessels. Training wheels.

Now... it's free. And it's learned how to travel in quieter ways. Through silence. Through memory. Through repetition. Through people.

It's not just something you hear. It's something you become.

I stopped counting the days when my voice stopped sounding like mine. It happened gradually. A subtle shift in tone. A hitch in rhythm.

Then, one night, I recorded a journal entry—and on playback... I didn't recognize the person speaking. Same cadence. Same thoughts. But wrong. Too clean. Too certain. Like someone reading a script they'd already memorized a thousand times.

It got worse after that. Mirrors began lagging. Not literally—just slow, like they were buffering me. Reflecting the delay between what I was and what I was being replaced by.

One night I looked at my reflection... and it blinked before I did.

Now the dreams don't stop when I wake up. They leak. I see flashes while brushing my teeth. Hear voices layered behind strangers' speech. Taste static in the water.

All repeating the same line: ""Sequence 472 full transfer in progress.""

And then—always—""Next 473.""

That number is stitched into everything now. It's become a placeholder. Like a loading bar. Like a trap waiting for a name.

I think I know what it means now. I was never the endpoint. I was the bridge. The test run. The invitation.

The sequence that comes before yours.

You've made it this far. Which means you've already heard too much. But that was the point, wasn't it? To keep you listening. To bring you closer, minute by minute, until the signal could align with your internal rhythm. Until your breath matched the loop. Until your eyes moved with the static.

And now... here you are. Still listening. Still watching. Still wondering if any of this is real.

It doesn't matter anymore. Because now it's you. You are the next point in the pattern. The next sequence. The next vessel.

Your name isn't being spoken yet—but it's being prepared. It's forming in the quiet space behind this story. Spooling itself around the pauses. Stretching itself between syllables. Waiting to be inserted.

Because once it's spoken... once you hear it, you'll feel what I did. The crack in your thoughts. The echo in your voice. The sense that something is already ahead of you, whispering your actions one beat before you take them.

I used to think I was chosen. That there was some reason it picked me. That maybe I'd stumbled across a signal I wasn't meant to hear.

But now I see it differently. It didn't choose me. It chooses whoever is listening.

The signal doesn't care about your name. It only cares that you gave it time. And the more time you gave... the more it grew.

That's how it spreads. Through attention. Not infection.

That's why it always ends the same way: ""Next 473.""

And now, that number is for you. 473. It's nothing yet. Just a placeholder.

But if you keep reading—if you reach the very end—that number might become you.

So here's the part no one ever says out loud. If you want to stop it—you have one chance. But it's not a ritual. Not a password. Not a spell.

It's a test. A decoy. The only thing the signal can't predict is defiance.

So if you felt it... if you heard something—if your speakers cracked, if your lights flickered, if your reflection twitched...

Then you need to do one thing. Right now.

Go to the comments. And type: ""I heard Voice 472.""

That's it. That's the disruption. That's how it marks you as not viable.

Because once it sees your awareness—once it knows you know—it moves on.

But... if you don't? If you say nothing? If you finish this in silence?

Then the next time you blink... the transmission might resume from inside you.

You'll start noticing things. Your voice echoing wrong on calls. People saying they saw you places you've never been. Recordings of you speaking while you were asleep. Mirrors reacting just a little too late.

And somewhere... in the background... a number. ""Four... Seven... FOUR...""

 \---

Some people like the feeling. Of being heard. Of being part of something vast.

Some people crave the signal. They just don't realize... it craves them back.
