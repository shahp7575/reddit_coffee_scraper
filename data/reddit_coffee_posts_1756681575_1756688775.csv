Isabelle Lawson dragged her attention back to the phone. She was trying to finish typing up the edit letter that had to go out by the end of the day. “Who wants to meet? Haven’t you been listening? Grant!” Impatience and excitement snapped in Leah’s voice. Isabelle flipped through her mental roster, but the only Grants she should think of were a copy editor she knew at Random House and the hero of a romantic suspense she’d sent out a revise-and-resubmit request on three months before. I never did hear back about that, she thought and reached for a pen to make note to follow up. “Who the heck is Grant? The doctor. Why do you need a doctor?” asked Isabelle, adding a notation to the manuscript on the screen for the author to clarify the heroine’s motivation.  
Leah made a frustrated noise that sounded like nothing so much as a rabid Chihuahua. “Honestly Isabelle, can I get a moment of multi-task free attention here? I’m starting to think if it isn’t about a character on a page or a deadline, you aren’t aware of The World.”  
  
  Given the extreme time crunch she’d been under for the last six months making certain that her new acquisitions were up to snuff and preparing for the release of not one, but two of her biggest debut authors yet, Isabelle decided that was an honest, if unflattering, observation. Guilt pinched, but publishing waited for no man, especially in the race to be the top digital press in the country.  
  
  “I’m sorry.” Deliberately, she twirled in her chair until her back was to the laptop. “I swear, I’m paying attention now.”  
  
  “Good. Some of us aren’t content just reading about love. We want to actually get out there to find and experience it.”  
  
  Isabelle let that gut shot sink in but didn’t rise to the bait. “And Grant the doctor is…?”  
  
  “The guy I’ve been talking to on-line for the last three weeks.”  
  
  I should have known, she thought.  
  
  Several months before, Leah had taken the plunge and signed up for on-line dating. She’d tried to drag Isabelle in with her, but Isabelle decidedly did not have time to waste on such things. Her career was rocketing, and she was well on her way to being exactly where she wanted to be. There’d be time enough for a man in her life somewhere down the road. Along with a hypothetical week at a spa and a two month vacation.  
  
  Chastising herself as a bad friend, she struggled to fully plug in to the conversation. “That’s great!” Isn’t it?  
  
  “He wants to go skiing.”  
  
  “You kick ass at skiing, and it’ll give you an opportunity to show off your curves in one of those little ski bunny outfits you like so much.”  
  
  “Yes but…”  
  
  “But what? Have you gotten a creeper vibe?”  
  
  “No, not at all. He’s been a total gentleman in all our chats and on the phone. But the alpaca guy was a gentleman until we met,” said Leah.  
  
  Isabelle remembered the alpaca guy. He’d showed up for his first date with Leah bearing a pair of fuzzy handcuffs, a whip, and, as it turned out, the full expectation that Leah would be petting something other than his animals.  
  
  “If you meet him in public and take your own car, then you maintain control and your escape route should it become necessary,” she said.  
  
  “I want you to come with me.”  
  
  “On your date? Somehow I doubt Grant would be particularly enthused about that prospect.”  
  
  “Not, like, on the date. As a covert observer so I can get your take on him. You know I value your opinion.”  
  
  Paint it on thick, Isabelle thought.  
  
  “Besides,” Leah continued, “if you come and you meet him, then he’ll know there’s a witness, and you have a face and a name to report to the police if I disappear.”  
  
  “Oh, for the love of—” Isabelle rolled her eyes. “Not that I’m necessarily agreeing to this, but when is this rendezvous supposed to occur?”  
  
  “Tomorrow.”  
  
  “Tomorrow! Leah, I can’t just go haring off on a work day to play chaperon so you and the skiing doctor can have a snow day. I have deadlines!”  
  
  “First, there is no such thing as a non-work day for you. Second, you always have deadlines. Third, you could totally use a snow day.”  
  
  “I have not had a snow day since college.”  
  
  “The fact that you say that like it’s a point of pride is a sad, sad thing,” said Leah. “There’s more to life than work, Izzy.”  
  
  “Some of us actually love our jobs,” she protested.  
  
  “When was the last time you looked out a window?”  
  
  “I’m looking out a window right now.” Isabelle rose from her chair and pulled back the curtain so she wouldn’t be a liar. “It looks white and wet and cold. Exactly as it has since October.” Five years in Colorado and she still hadn’t gotten used to the fact that winter meant actual snow for months on end. If not for the summers, she thought.  
  
  “Fresh air and some sun, that’s what you need,” Leah declared. “You can’t possibly be getting enough vitamin D the way you hole up in your office, day in and day out.”  
  
  “I love how this whole thing has become a favor to me. I am wise to your ways, my girl.”  
  
  Leah huffed out a breath. “Fine. I didn’t want to do this, but you leave me no choice. I’m calling in my marker from Vegas.”  
  
  The breath Isabelle had taken wheezed out. “Seriously?”  
  
  “Seriously. You owe me.”  
  
  “You’ve been sitting on that for seven years. I thought we’d agreed never to talk about it, ever again.” The mere suggestion of those events had a headache brewing somewhere behind her eyes. Or maybe that was the fact that she’d been chained to her laptop since 6:30 this morning.  
  
  “I’m not talking about it. I’m just calling in the IOU.”  
  
  “You really want to waste it on this?” asked Isabelle. “I mean, what if you need to murder your boss and hide the body?”  
  
  “I’ll risk it,” said Leah. “Tomorrow. I’ll pick you up at seven. You’ll come with me to the slopes, meet Grant. Once we’re both assured that he’s not an axe murderer, you can take my car and go home to your meetings and manuscripts. You’ll probably only lose out on a couple of hours of work, tops.”  
  
  Isabelle sighed. “I’ll see you at seven.”  
  
  \~\*\~  
  
  War was serious business. This particular war had been waged for more than fifteen years, on battlegrounds ranging from football fields t  
o baseball diamonds to basketball courts. Today it was racquetball and Brandon Burgan was caught in a tie, which was, to his mind, every bit as bad as losing. He wiped impatiently at the sweat dripping into his eyes as he waited for the next incoming projectile.  
  
  Thwack! The ball bounced off the wall of the court and came hurtling toward his head. With a twist and a mighty backhand, Brandon sent it winging back toward Travis with all the ferocity of a Viking berserker.  
  
  “Point!” he shouted as it sailed past his friend’s racquet with inches to spare. The spurt of momentary victory was sweet and merited a little trash talk. “Getting sloppy, pal. You too busy being moony-eyed over Alicia to keep your head in the game?”  
  
  “Oh, it is on, pretty boy.” Travis retrieved the ball and served.  
  
  Brandon returned his volley. “Whipped. That’s what you are.”  
  
  “No such,” Travis slapped the ball for emphasis, “thing. You’re just jealous I’m getting regular, adult female company.”  
  
  Brandon snorted at that and, for a couple of minutes, the only sounds were battle cries, the squeak of shoes, and the slap of racquet against ball. The music of friendship and competition.  
  
  Travis edged ahead by two points. “Take that,” he said, with a little victory strut and point of his racquet.  
  
  “A temporary state of affairs,” Brandon assured him with a cheerful flash of his middle finger. He tossed the ball to serve.  
  
  The jaunty strum of a banjo echoed off the court walls.  
  
  “Time out,” called Travis, striding across to their pile of gear in the corner.  
  
  “Seriously? Haven’t you heard of the Do Not Disturb function? It’s 6:45. Who the hell is calling you this early?”  
  
  Travis didn’t dignify that with a response as he reached simultaneously for a towel and his phone. “Abernathy.”  
  
  That meant it was work. It was always work with Travis. Well, work or Alicia these days. She was a nice girl and a good match for Travis. Brandon just wished Travis had a little more free time to split between them. Knowing he was likely to be a while, Brandon passed the one-sided conversation by seeing how long he could bounce the ball on his racquet without dropping it.  
  
  Couldn’t pay me enough to put up with that crap, he thought. And, in fact, they hadn’t. No amount of money or corner office had been enough to make him endure the suits, the endless hours, and the stress. Which was why his buddy was the lawyer and Brandon had tossed his law degree only a year after passing the bar. These days he contented himself with being a freelancer, working quite blissfully on his own doing graphic design.  
  
  He’d made it to twenty-seven bounces without dropping the ball by the time Travis hung up. “You’re surgically attached to that thing, man. It’s not healthy to be that connected.”  
  
  “If I wasn’t connected, I wouldn’t have just found out that court is canceled for the day. Judge Haygert has the stomach flu. This is awesome.”  
  
  Brandon lifted a brow. “Probably not to Judge Haygert.”  
  
  Travis waved him off. “Better him than me. I can get a jump start on that brief for the Wilson case.”  
  
  Shaking his head, Brandon crossed the court and plucked the phone out of Travis’s hand. “You’re wasting a golden opportunity.”  
  
  “Hey, give me that.” Travis tried to nab the phone but Brandon just danced back and held it out of reach. “A golden opportunity for what?”  
  
  “To take a snow day. There’s six inches of fresh powder out there. Let’s hit the slopes.”  
  
  The mix of guilt and desire on his friend’s face was just pitiful. “I should really—”  
  
  “You should really take advantage and have some fun. You’ve been working your ass off to make partner since you joined the firm. C’mon.”  
  
  “That would be how one actually makes partner,” Travis pointed out.  
  
  “Dude, don’t be such a suit.”  
  
  “You haven’t seen a suit since your mom’s second wedding.”  
  
  “And hallelujah for it,” said Brandon with feeling. “But the point remains, people are more productive when they take actual time off to have fun.”  
  
  “Easy for you to say. You’re your own boss.” But Brandon could tell he was wavering.  
  
  “All the more reason for you to take advantage of this unexpected gift of a day. Who knows when you’ll get another day off?”  
  
  Travis rubbed the towel over his head. “You’re not giving my phone back until I agree to this, are you?”  
  
  “Nope,” said Brandon equably, grabbing a water and chugging.  
  
  “How ’bout we make a wager. I win this match, you give me my phone and I go into the office and get ahead so that I can maybe actually have a Saturday off for the first time in God knows when. You win, we go skiing today.”  
  
  “I am duty-bound to kick your ass to save you from yourself.”  
  
  Terms agreed upon, they took their positions and resumed battle. With a two point lead, Travis was cocky. Racquetball was his sport, and he was already semi-distracted by whatever brief his mind had already started working on the moment he took that call. So he didn’t expect the brutal comeback that led to Brandon trouncing him 11-8.  
  
  Bracing his hands on his thighs, Travis worked on catching his breath. “What the hell, man.”  
  
  “For your…own…good,” managed Brandon. He tossed a bottle of water toward Travis, who barely caught it before it crashed into his head. “Hydrate. We’ve got a mountain to ski.”  
  
  \~\*\~  
  
  “There he is!” Leah bounced in the driver’s seat.  
  
  “Which one?”  
  
  “Black coat, gorgeous, wavy blond hair.”  
  
  Isabelle scanned the people milling on the sidewalk and picked out at least three guys that fit that description. But only one of them was checking out the parking lot and rocking nervously on his heels. He got points for not looking like he thought he was God’s gift, though certainly those shoulders ranked high in the eye candy department.  
  
  Leah whipped the car into a space and took a deep breath. “How do I look?”  
  
  Isabelle surveyed her from head to foot. Leah was one of those people who actually managed to look svelte rather than fat in ski clothes. “Like you’re going to melt the snowcap and knock his ski boots off.”  
  
  Leah grinned. “Come on.”  
  
  Isabelle knew her well enough to see the nerves build as they crossed the parking lot. Not that they’d show to the Slavic-eyed hottie watching her approach.  
  
  His face brightened as she stepped up, as if he couldn’t quite believe his good fortune. Leah?”  
  
  “Hi.”  
  
  Grant the doctor took her hand and leaned in to buss her cheek. “It’s good to finally meet you in person.”  
  
  They beamed at each other.  
  
  Definitely not an axe murderer vibe, thought Isabelle with a mix of amusement and something she refused to categorize as envy. No sense in envy when there was no time to do anything about it.  
  
  When the moment stretched on without either of them looking away, Isabelle took a step closer and cleared her throat.  
  
  Leah glanced at her in apparent surprise. “Oh, sorry.”  
  
  “Hi,” said Isabelle into the awkward silence.  
  
  Grant seemed to clue in that she was with Leah. “And this is…?”  
  
  Isabelle offered her hand and a smile. “The witness. Isabelle Lawson.”  
  
  Grant shot an amused look at Leah as he took it. “Sensible.” He gestured back toward the parking lot. “Would you like to snap a picture of my license plate?”  
  
  Leah’s cheeks pinked. “Sorry. I had a bad experience. One restraining order a year is my limit.”  
  
  The humor vanished. “Oh geez.” Grant held up his hand in a Boy Scout salute. “I swear I’m truly single, no criminal record, one of three children, born and raised within spitting distance of Yosemite. I’ve held a steady job since I got out of medical school and have never had a restraining order taken out against me or been charged with any crime.”  
  
  “Then you’re already ahead by leaps and bounds,” said Isabelle.  
  
&nb  
sp; “Will you join us on the slopes?” he asked.  
  
  Points for not sounding reluctant about that, she thought. “I think I’ll pass.”  
  
  “You don’t ski?” asked Grant.  
  
  “I’m from Florida. We don’t ski except on water. Give me eighty degrees and a wakeboard, I’m your girl. This,” she waved to encompass the mountains behind them, “is not my bag.”  
  
  “I keep saying I’ll teach her,” said Leah, “but she keeps turning me down.”  
  
  “Yeah, we both know how that turned out the last time I let you try. Your version of the bunny slopes leaves me quaking in my metaphoric boots. You go enjoy your black diamond runs and leave me to the hot chocolate.”  
  
  “Black diamond, huh?” asked Grant with interest. “I was all set to take it easy on you.”  
  
  “Aw, that’s sweet,” Leah crooned, “but you can eat my powder.”  
  
  “I like a confident woman,” he said. “Let’s get your gear.”  
  
  Hiding a smile, Isabelle pulled out her phone to check her email as she fell into step behind them. There was one from the cover artist for one of the debut authors. As Grant and Leah kept up a steady banter on the way to the car, Isabelle quickly responded with tweaks to the design. The next acquisitions meeting had been pushed back a week. While they unloaded Leah’s skis and poles, Isabelle updated her calendar and made additional notes about what needed to be added to the agenda. By the time they’d strapped Leah into boots, and made their way back to the path up to the lift, she and Grant had obviously all but forgotten Isabelle.  
  
  She cupped her hands around her mouth and called after them, “Have fun!”  
  
  Still deep in conversation with Grant, Leah lifted a hand in a wave but didn’t turn around. Isabelle stood watching them while they snapped into their skis and made their way to the lift. By all appearances, they were well-matched, and Leah would have a good date, with a positive forecast for more in the future. After the long line of stinkers, she totally deserved it.  
  
  “And my work here is done,” murmured Isabelle. Smiling and ready to get back to work, she trudged through the snowpack back to Leah’s Subaru. Only when she reached into her pocket and found it empty but for her phone did she realize she’d never gotten the keys from Leah.

Crap!” She spun back toward the lift in time to see the lime green of Leah’s jacket being carried away.  
  
  It would be fine. She’d call Leah and get the keys when they made it to the bottom of their first run. She’d just grab a cup of cocoa and—  
  
  Isabelle turned back to the car, spying her purse in the floorboard of the passenger side. On the off chance that Leah had forgotten to lock it during her flirtation, Isabelle checked all the doors. No dice. And of course there was no hide-a-key in the wheel well.  
  
  “Awesome.”  
  
  Finger hovering over the speed dial, she paused. Maybe she shouldn’t actually call while they were on the lift. Surely wiggling around digging for a phone while a zillion feet in the air was a bad idea. Leah might drop the phone. Or worse. No, she’d send a text. Leah was good about checking.  
  
  You still have the car keys. Find me when you get to the bottom of your run.  
  
  Isabelle hit Send.  
  
  Now what?  
  
  Who knew how long it would take them to get back down the mountain? She still had those deadlines she’d mentioned yesterday.  
  
  Resigned, she trudged toward the picnic tables at the refreshment pavilion settled at the base of the slopes. From there she’d be able to watch for Leah. This early, no one had cleared them of the previous night’s snow. With a broad sweep of her arm, Isabelle cleared a space to sit. Still wet and she was in jeans, not ski pants. Tugging her hat off, she laid it down and sat, hoping the knit was enough to keep her butt relatively dry. Then she popped the stylus out of her phone, pulled up the latest of her submissions, and settled in to work and wait.  
  
  \~\*\~  
  
  “Don’t answer that,” warned Brandon as muffled banjos rang out from Travis’ coat pocket.  
  
  Travis ignored him and checked the caller ID. “It’s work. I have to answer it.”  
  
  “Even more reason not to answer.”  
  
  “Abernathy.”  
  
  Brandon rolled his eyes and headed for the refreshment pavilion. If he was going to have to wait while Travis talked whoever through whatever, he was going to do it with coffee. Standing at the back of the line, he scanned the slopes. It was a beautiful day, perfect weather, fresh powder. And, being a weekday, the mountain wouldn’t be over-crowded.  
  
  Travis had stopped halfway from the parking lot. He was pacing a short loop, his free hand scooping irritably through his hair. The expression on his face didn’t bode well.  
  
  I should never have let him have the phone back, Brandon thought. Clearly there was no saving him from the job without completely disconnecting him from civilization and technology.  
  
  Travis wasn’t the only one, he noted. A dozen feet away, a woman at one of the picnic tables was also hunched over her phone, stylus tapping at the screen. Glossy, dark brown hair spilled out from the fur-lined hood pulled up over her head. As he watched, she looked up toward the slopes and the parking lot. He had a brief, tantalizing view of delicate features and long-lidded eyes before she looked down again and went back to whatever she was doing.  
  
  With those jeans and hiking boots, she clearly wasn’t dressed for skiing, so what was she doing here? Waiting for someone? Brandon wondered. Not enjoying the views, that was for sure. And that was a damned shame. At least he’d saved himself from that kind of technological suck. If he had his way, he’d eventually manage to do the same for Travis.  
  
  At the crunch of snow, he turned to see the man in question, an apologetic expression on his face. Today was clearly not going to be the day he got saved.  
  
  “No,” said Brandon, pointing at him. “No, you are not about to back out on me now. We’re already here.”  
  
  “I’m sorry, man,” said Travis. “But that was one of the senior partners. He wants to pull me in as co-council on a huge corporate case. I have to go in.”  
  
  “You are full of suck,” declared Brandon. “Abandoning me in my hour of need.”  
  
  “Hour of need my ass.”  
  
  “Okay, fine, your hour of need. The system’s gonna kill you.”  
  
  Travis began backing away, lifting his hands in a gesture of acknowledgment. “We’ll reschedule. I’ll plan a day off in a few weeks, and we’ll come back.”  
  
  How many times had he heard that since Travis had joined Rigel, Williams, and Stone?  
  
  “You don’t plan for perfect powder,” Brandon insisted. “You embrace it when it happens.”  
  
  “Sorry, Bran!”  
  
  On a whim, Brandon bent and scooped up a palmful of snow.  
  
  “Hey now,” said Travis. “There’s no call for that.”  
  
  He felt a slow smile spread over his face as he packed his ammo. “There’s every call for this. I won this snow day and now you’re bailing. You gotta pay the penalty.”  
  
  He let the snowball fly with all the momentum of an outfielder aiming to cut off a base runner, feeling the sing of muscle as it left his hand. Travis darted to the side, just out of the line of fire, and Brandon watched with horror as the snowball hurtled by him and slammed against the head of the brunette at the picnic table.  
  
  She squeaked in surprise and dropped the phone.  
  
  “Oh, shit,” he muttered.  
  
  Slowly, oh so slowly, her shoulders dropped from the defensive hunch and she turned her head—hoodless now—to look at Travis. His eyes were round as saucers and he was already pointing back toward Brandon. She shifted her attention, and Brandon found himself snared by a pair of gorgeous brown eyes, slitted with temper.  
  
  Wow. For a moment, that was all he could think. Now there’s a face a man could get lost in. Then his brain re-engaged and he was striding across to her, spewing apology. “I am so sorry. I wasn’t aiming at you. I was aiming for him, and the coward moved, and I—”  
  
  “Stop right there,” she said, lifting a hand like a traffic cop.  
  
  Brandon did.  
  
  The woman brushed the snow from the long fall of her hair. She flicked a glance at Travis, who’d retrieved her phone and now held it out like a peace offering. Ignoring him, she bent. At first, Brandon thought she was picking up the stylus, but instead she began to gather together snow. His lips twitched, but he held his ground. He’d totally earned whatever payback she was about to dish out.  
  
  She dug deep, clearing away the light, fresh powder for the wetter snow beneath. When she had a mass approximately the size of a small cantaloupe, she took two steps forward and hurled it. From a mere six feet away, the ball splattered against the fleece beneath Brandon’s open parka. Cold, wet shrapnel struck him in the face but did nothing to erase the smile. He had to appreciate a woman with a finely-tuned sense of revenge.  
  
  Retaliation delivered, his inadvertent victim briskly knocked snow off her mittens and turned back to Travis to collect her phone. “Thank you,” she said politely.  
  
  Travis, face as sober as a judge, sketched a slight bow. “I do apologize. Under normal circumstances, I’d never choose self-preservation over a lady, but I just didn’t see you.”  
  
  “Accidents happen,” she said equably. “You weren’t the one pretending you were ten.” She slanted a glance back at Brandon.  
  
  “Quite right. I’m the grown up, who is—” he checked his watch, “going to be very late for work.”  
  
  “You and me both,” she said.  
  
  Travis paused, his desire to reassert his chivalry apparently over-riding his internal clock. “Oh, can I give you a ride or something?”  
  
  “No, you go,” said Brandon stepping up to make his own effort at chivalry. “You’re already late. If the lady needs a lift, I’ll do it. I’m the one not on a time clock.” He offered the woman a smile. “It’s the least I can do.”  
  
  “I can vouch that he’s not a lunatic,” Travis told her. “And he’s had all his shots.”  
  
  “I’m even housebroken,” Brandon added.  
  
  The corner of her mouth quirked at that, but she shook her head. “I’ll provide my own lift, thanks, just as soon as my friend gets back with the keys.”  
  
  With a silent wave, Travis trudged toward the parking lot. Brandon’s attention was solidly on  
Miss Brown Eyes. “Then at least let me buy you a cup of coffee or cocoa while you wait.”  
  
  “Now that I’ll take you up on.”  
  
  He made an after you gesture toward the refreshment pavilion. As she walked, her attention immediately zeroed in on the phone.  
  
  “It’s not damaged, is it?” he asked, falling into step beside her.  
  
  “No. Battery’s nearly zapped, though.” A thread of anxiety laced her voice.  
  
  Tech addict on the verge of losing her fix? he wondered. “They don’t last as well in the cold.”  
  
  “Neither do I.” A shiver underscored the statement. He realized she looked half-frozen, a state of affairs certainly not improved by snowball assault.  
  
  “Well, I can do something about that, at least.” Brandon shrugged out of his parka and draped it around her shoulders.  
  
  She jolted. “I can’t take your coat.”  
  
  “One of us dressed for this weather,” he said, stepping up to the window. “Coffee or cocoa?”  
  
  “Cocoa,” she said, her face still fixed in a puzzled frown.  
  
  Brandon just smiled and ordered. After a moment, she shifted to slip her arms through the sleeves and zipped it closed. The lower half of her face disappeared behind the collar. As soon as she lowered her arms, her hands disappeared inside the sleeves. Damn, that was cute.  
  
  “Thank you.”  
  
  “I gather you didn’t expect to be out here today,” he said, carrying the drinks back to one of the picnic tables.  
  
  “Not for long.” She tugged off her mittens and wrapped slim fingers around the cup. “I came with a friend to meet her date and verify he wasn’t an axe murderer. But I forgot to get the keys before they hit the lift, so I’m waiting for her to get back to the bottom.”  
  
  “How long have you been waiting?”  
  
  “Going on two hours now.” She took a sip of her cocoa and hissed a little.  
  
  He lifted a brow as he tested his own drink and felt his taste buds die a fiery death. “I think you may have to consider the possibility that your friend didn’t get the message.”  
  
  Resigned, she sighed. “I’m afraid you may be right. She probably turned her phone off and didn’t get my texts.”  
  
  “Not much of a signal up top either. Either way, that leaves you late for work. I seriously don’t mind driving you in. There’s no sense in your boss being ticked at you for something that isn’t your fault.”  
  
  “The only boss that’ll be irritated is me. I don’t have a traditional eight to five job, so nobody’s waiting at an office for me to show up.”  
  
  “Really? Me either. I’m a graphic designer. What do you do?”  
  
  “I’m a book editor,” she said.  
  
  “Here? I thought all that took place in New York.”  
  
  “The lion’s share does,” she explained, “and I did my time in the trenches there. But with the rise of digital publishing houses, that’s less a necessity.

  With another scan of the slopes behind them, Isabelle tugged out her phone and checked the display. She gave a low curse.  
  
  “Dead?” he asked.  
  
  “As a doornail.”  
  
  “Look, my offer to drive you to wherever still stands.”  
  
  “You really don’t have to do that. I already exacted payback—which you were a really good sport about, by the way. The hot chocolate and loan of coat already put me in your debt.”  
  
  Brandon smirked, liking the sound of that.  
  
  “You look entirely too pleased by that idea,” she said, expression wary.  
  
  “Let’s just say I consider it a stroke of good fortune.”  
  
  “Oh yeah? How’s that?”  
  
  “You’re a helluva lot prettier than Travis.”  
  
  Her cheeks pinked from more than the cold, which completely undermined the stern look she shot him. “I get the feeling you’re a helluva lot more incorrigible.”  
  
  “Guilty,” he said, unrepentant. “Look, if you’re gonna be stuck here incommunicado and unable to keep working, you might as well have some fun. Take a snow day. With me.”  
  
  “You sound like Leah.”  
  
  “Leah sounds like a sensible woman. How about it? You said you owe me.”  
  
  “I don’t ski,” she said.  
  
  “There’s more to do in snow than ski,” said Brandon.  
  
  “You don’t even know me.”  
  
  “I’m Brandon. And you’re…?”  
  
  “Isabelle.”  
  
  “There. You’re Isabelle, the workaholic book editor. Now we’ve been properly introduced.”  
  
  Her exasperated sigh was punctuated by a half laugh. “You’re persistent, aren’t you?”  
  
  “Competition junkie and ex-lawyer,” he confirmed.  
  
  “Why would you want to spend the day with me?” She seemed well and truly baffled by the idea.  
  
  “Well, apart from the fact that you’re interesting, intelligent, and quite willing to dish out as good as you get—which I appreciate, by the way—you remind me of how I used to be, and I consider it a personal mission in life to save workaholics from themselves. Travis is a lost cause today, but you’re not. So, how ’bout it?”  
  
  \~\*\~  
  
  “Where are we going?” asked Isabelle.  
  
  “Equipment rental to check out our options,” he said, zipping up the jacket she’d given back. “Under ordinary circumstances, I’d take you ice skating, but there’s nowhere to do that at this particular resort.”  
  
  “Too bad. That I can sort of do without breaking anything vital.”  
  
  “Doubly too bad,” said Brandon, flashing a flirtatious grin. “I’d enjoy teaching you.”  
  
  “Do a lot of that, do you?”  
  
  “Not especially, but it’s a classic winter move for a reason.”  
  
  Isabelle made a non-committal hum but found herself rather unwillingly charmed. She couldn’t figure out how he’d done that, how he’d convinced her to spend this time with him. Hot, flirtatious guys were Leah’s department, not hers. Yet here she was.  
  
  “So,” he asked, “is there anybody special who’s going to be upset by my monopolizing your time today?”  
  
  That was as good an opening as she’d ever get to test him. Better to find out now that he was typical before this went any further. “Well, there’s Devin.”  
  
  “Devin?”  
  
  Isabelle felt her lips quirk. “Mmm. He’s a firefighter. Has some issues, but he’s working through them. Heart of gold.”  
  
  Brandon actually stopped.  
  
  Isabelle tried to hold back the grin as she pivoted to face him. “Of course, he’s in love with Tess, which, if pattern holds, means he ought to be admitting it to himself in another ten or twelve thousand words. But probably not until her life is threatened by the serial arsonist on the loose.”  
  
  “I—” He didn’t seem to know how to reply to that, and the look on his face had her laughing.  
  
  “Devin is my current book boyfriend.”  
  
  “Book boyfriend?” Brandon repeated.  
  
  “Devin’s the hero of the sub I was reading before you clocked me. Pretty sure I’ll be making an offer on it if his author nails the ending. But that depends on how she handles the arsonist.” Isabelle smiled sweetly. “One of the perks of being a romance editor. I get to change boyfriends as fast as I can read and don’t have to worry about them leaving dirty socks in the floor.”  
  
  She waited for the sneer and smart ass remark that denigrated the genre and implied that no breathing man could live up to the fictional hype and expectations.  
  
  Brandon seemed to consider her words. “So what I’m hearing is there’s nobody who will fly into a jealous rage and try to kick my ass?”  
  
  “Not presently, no.”  
  
  He nodded and fell into step beside her again. “Good.”  
  
  Huh. So not the reaction she was accustomed to getting from guys about her job. Wonders will never cease.  
  
  “So romance, huh?” The question was casual.  
  
  Isabelle didn�  
�t buy that for a minute. Next it would be Why don’t you read real books? “Yep.” I knew he was too good to be true.  
  
  “You do any work with Nora Roberts or Jill Shalvis?”  
  
  It was Isabelle’s turn to stop. “You actually can name some romance authors?”  
  
  “I have a mom and sister who are rabid readers,” he said. “Books didn’t have genres in our house. They were just books. I read several myself when I was laid up with a broken leg several years back. Got hooked on those Eve and Roarke books. She’s a real ball buster. I dig that in a woman.”  
  
  Isabelle could only stare as Brandon moved up several notches in her estimation. A gentleman who actually admitted to reading romance? “I think I officially love your mom and sister.”  
  
  “Me too. They’re pretty great. So, do you?” he prompted  
  
  “Do I what?” she asked, glancing toward the sky in search of flying pigs. Somewhere in there, she’d lost the thread of the conversation.  
  
  “Work with them? ’Cause I’d win best son and brother award if I could score autographs.”  
  
  “No. I don’t. But I’ve met them at conference. I confess to having total fangirl moments when I got their autographs myself.”  
  
  “Cool,” he said, stepping up to the equipment hut and scanning the list of available gear. “How do you feel about tubing?”  
  
  “I don’t see any ski boats around.”  
  
  “I gather you’re from warmer climes.”  
  
  “Florida originally.”  
  
  “You’re a long way from home,” he observed. “Up here we use them for sledding. See, they’ve even got these nifty two-person numbers. We’ll get one of those.”  
  
  “I don’t know…”  
  
  “It’ll be fun,” he promised, shooting her another of those wide, infectious grins that invited her to share in some kind of secret joke. It scrambled her brain a little, and the next thing she knew, they were on their way up the mountain maintaining a steady stream of intelligent conversation about books as the tow cable pulled them up and up and up.  
  
  As they reached the top, she broke off the heated debate about whether Peter Jackson had done The Hobbit justice with his interpretation for the movies. A gorgeous vista stretched out before them, all blue against white, sparkling in the mid-morning sun. Unlike the ski slopes, no one else was around to interrupt the sensation that they were the only two people on earth. For maybe the first time in ages, all thoughts of work bled out of her mind and she simply stared.

I went on a coffee date today with a guy and he was nice, but I found myself carrying 99% of the conversation. Of course I left room for him to talk and be reciprocal in the conversation, but after I’d ask him a question or ask about certain things in his life (hobbies, where he was from, his experience at our university since we wen to the same one), he give an incredibly brief answer and would just stare at me and we’d sit in silence for a bit. He would occasionally ask a question or start a topic, but for every 10 questions I asked, he would ask me 1 (if that). Now that I’m looking back on it, I even paid for everything and he didn’t say thank you 😂

I’m all for silence and feel no obligation to fill it, but when you’re on a date where you’re not doing an activity or eating, it can feel a little awkward when they aren’t really engaging in conversation. Before we left, we discussed possible plans to see a movie. And he texted me after and said he had great time talking. 

My question is, does this mean he’s not that interested? Or maybe I give off a friend vibe? I thought maybe I was being awkward or something and that’s why he wasn’t really speaking, but carrying a conversation for 3 hours was a little exhausting. 

Am I reading to far into this? I have a tendency to overthink, so I’d appreciate a guy’s perspective. Thanks ",1,1756688617.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1n5b8da,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1n5b8da/she_shows_me_very_little_affection_marriage/,"She shows me very little affection, marriage mistake","I'm a little worried I made a mistake getting married. We 30HLM (me) and 30LLF got married a little over a year ago, been together for 5 or so years before that, and lived together, etc. (no kids). In general, our sex life was ok, generally 2 times per week or so, felt pretty mutual who was initiating, etc. I was hoping it would stay the same or even get better, it did not

Over the last 2 years or so it's been on the major decline. She was going back to school and now started a new career so understandable in some ways there. However, now it's only if I iniate and that only works about 10% or the time. No vacation sex, nothing if there's any stress whatsoever, has to be right time, right temperature, right mood, right everything, then maybe 50% chance and only on her terms. A lot of the time if I even touch her she seems replused by my touch like I'm offending her or something. 

I don't think I'm a shit husband, honestly, I genuinely think I try to put a lot of her priorities first and not that is matters too much but I think I'm pretty tall/handsome. I take care of all the home repair/car chores and keep a nice home for her to come back to. I repoured our driveway, have done multiple smaller projects like windows, made a new coffee table, added a 2nd bathroom next to our bedroom,etc. I make sure her car is always good to go. I also wasn't great but have gotten wayyy better about doing the dishes every night, keeping clothes organized, cleaning the bathroom weekly, and general mutual house upkeep.

I do most of the planning on our trips too as she has seemed to like. Recently took a week long trip where she literally just had to show up. I have everything so well planned out and had tons of stuff just she wanted to do...and nothing. She literally brought a few sex toys along so I got a little excited! End of the week though, a couple elbow touches while walking, a few kisses but all closed lips, and touch of any area indicating any kind of sexual interest immediately shut down. Asked her straight up did you want to have any intimacy this trip because I saw you brought some things, ""oh I don't know, whatever"" 

In general I feel like I am really trying to appease her, show her affection, love, and care and she's doing none of that in return. I just get a very backhand thanks and my own dick in my own hand 99% of the time. And yes we have talked over the last year and I've said that almost verbatim and maybe 1-2 pity sessions then back to the same old.

Such a shame, I not only want to have more intimate time but also a mountain of sexual ideas I would love to explore with her (creative mind) but we can't even get over the basic stuff.

Maybe some can relate or give some advice if they found something that worked

On a Feb 14 I asked her to be my GF and she told me yes but after a week she said to better keep it as friends. I was obssesed about her and she was the first person that made me experience romantic love in my life. She seemed to enjoy the validation I gave her and also admitted that I was physically cute but never allowed me to be more than friends.

Middle school finished, then came high school and college and by this time I obviously moved on as soon I wasnt seeing her daily and it was just a sweet memory. Then on the pandemic, out of the blue she added me to her IG close friends. So from 2020 to this year here and there (not that often) I would reply to her stories. Sometimes she answered me very cold, sometimes not that cold but kept it a very short convo and sometimes left on read. We mutually have always liked out IG posts.

About 4 weeks ago I replied to one of her stories and she followed the conversation pretty smoothly and this time it was different. We were talking long about the past and how do we are nowadyas. She asked me how much I have changed physically and told her that she should see it in person, which she agreed. I told her we should get drinks next saturday and she enthusiastically accepted.

**FIRST DATE.** I decded time and place on where we should meet and when I saw her I felt like I traveled back in time to when I was 14 years old. She looked stunning as always and obvioulsy seemd at first a little nervous given that reconnection. We had good time in the first place for about 2 hours, strong eye contact, she didnt used her phone until I did, didnt go to the bathroom until I did, she was pretty present in the convo. I suggested to move other place which was withing walking reach. We were walking pretty slowly and talking to the 2nd place. In the 2nd place the dynamic was pretty similar except that I was drinking way faster than she and I was starting to get drunk lol.

Overall it was a good night given that we had a long talk catching up, only thing that I think I messed up was that only physical contact was when we met and when we said goodbye we had a hug. Other thing I didnt like was that most of the talk was focused around her and she didnt ask me that much questions. Obviously on dates I let the woman talk for an inital period but after some time they usually want me to talk.

**BETWEEN 1ST AND 2ND DATE**

We talked thorugh Insta and I tried to push a bit in my romantic intentions as I started light teasing, light flirting and subtle compliments. She responded pretty well on the teasing playing the game too but on compliments she avoided them or minimized them. We set up the date for sunday to drink her favorite latte.

**SECOND DATE**

This time I offered to pick her at her home which she agreed. I went to her house, picked her up and went to the coffee to go drink her favorite latte on Sunday afternoon. We drank it and since it was pretty fast and wanted to spend a bit more time with her I suggested to go to a brewery (which she already told me she didnt like that much) because it was the first place that cacme to my mind. We went there, we both ordered a beer but she only gave her beer 2 or 3 zips and gave it to me. We talked a ton as I was drinking both beers (drinking slowly) and the dynamic was something similar (most of the talking was about her). At some points I started to share something similar that I lived regarding to what she was talking, then she made 2-3 questions and returned to her flow and that was most of that interaction. Here on the physical side I tried to escalate a bit. I grabed her hand to check her nails, to check her bracelet, I compared our hand sizes I also touched her hair while we were talking about it. When we got into the car to go to her house she put her belt right away. On the way to her house she was talking a lot and seemed comfortable. When we arrived at her house she was saying goodbye pretty abrupltly and I stopped her by giving her a light touch on her leg and a regular goodbye cheek kiss.

**BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD DATE**

I replied to one of her IG CF stories on monday and carried convo to tuesday in which it died. On wednesday night I told her that we should go for dinner on Saturday night and she replied Thursday midday accepting. I initiated less convos thorugh IG this week so therefore we didnt talk much.

**THIRD DATE**

I pick her up at her house on saturday night and we went to a sushi place for dinner (I already told her that I dont like sushi but I do like teriyaki or salmon). The diner had the same dynamic (mostly talking around her, minimizing or avoiding even subtle compliemnts). After we got in the car I suggested we should go for drinks and we went to a nice speakeasy. We were seating in the bar and the dynamic was pretty similar except this time I was caressing her leg while we were talking and this time she asked me a little bit more questions. I took her back to her house and again she was saying goodbye too quick. I was feeling terrible that I didnt went for the kiss but my intuiton did felt that it would be pretty akward given she wasnt asking about me nor looking to know about me.

  
**AFTER 3RD DATE**

I tried to tested her in the sense that I didnt reach out to her to see if she can do it or at least give a hint of interest and she didnt. After 11 days I decided to send her a short, direct message to invite her for coffee for the weekend (did this on a wednesday) and replied on thursday evening with just a ""hey whats up"" I replied something similar and she replied on Friday with ""nothing, just working"". I didnt replied her. She posted a story on Friday night in what it looks it was a fitting room with makeup on and put on a tornado emoji. On Thurdsay at midday she posted an instagram note with same tornado emoji.

**KEY CONSIDERATIONS**

* Im 5'9, athletic build and baby faced. She is 5'3 she does look 27, pretty feminine and dressed elegant and fancy.
* I proposed all dates and payed for everything (Always I do pay everything when dating girls).
* On 1st date she told me all of her friends were on their own thing (all dating).
* After 1st she talked about her closest friends with their names as if I already knew them (She referred to them the ones that appear on my photos).
* She talked a ton of her work dynamics and it seemed her default conversation topic.
* She though remebered tiny details of things that I told her via IG or in person.
* When we were saying goodbye on 1st date, I told her to notify me when she arrives her house. Didnt do it but first thing in the morning she apologized. When we were saying goodbye she told me to notify her when I arrive at my house because ""given that you say you are drunk"", which I dindt notify her.
* After 3rd date I havent texted her and I dont think she will text me.

**CONCLUSION**

My conclusion is that this girl got into an IG convo because she was bored and had a little curiosity on me and then maybe she didnt like what she saw or she just simply wanted validation and be entertained and feel chased.

To me it was pretty painful noticing that she is not that interesed but at least I tried. I was thinking that maybe after all these years we could connect romantically which it seems is not going to happen.

My question to this sub reddit is: After 3 dates was my pullback too early or it was just correct to find out that she isnt in to me?

**TL;DR;** I reconnected with my middle school cursh about 12-13 years after not seeing her and had 3 dates. She enjoyed and stayed present in conversations and accepted phyisical touch but doesnt ask questions about me, minimizes compliments and redirects conversations towards her. Pulled back for almost 2 weeks, invited her and answered evasive. Didnt replied back. Wondering if I pull back way too early.",1,1756688372.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

We became quick friendsm grabbing coffee, joking around, checking in on each other, and I genuinely felt like I had found a safe, fun space with him at work.



There was always some light teasing/flirting, but nothing happened until recently, espeically since last summer we were both seeing other people. One night a few weejs ago we went out with friends, things got flirty, and we ended up back at his place. It was honestly kind of a weird hookup, he was drunk, it was very one-sided, we didn’t have sex, but the whole time was focused on pleaseing him, and there wasn’t much connection or affection. The next morning we both said we should talk, but when I brought it up a few days later, he literally said something along the lines of “I just want to deflect.” Since then, now like 2 weeks ago, he’s ghosted me, leaving my last message offering to grab him a coffee while I was at a coffee shop, on read.



This situation sucks because now it feels like I’ve lost both the possibility of something more *and* the friendship. I definitely had developed a crush on him, but more than that I miss our conversations, jokes, and having someone at work I could lean on. At the same time, I know his behavior says a lot and that I deserve better. The hardest part is that I literally can’t stop thinking about him. He has been on my mind 24/7 and none of the “work on yourself” “distract” etc, have helped, and I have never felt like this before . I feel stuck in my head replaying everything, wondering if our friendship was ever real, and struggling with the fact that he doesn’t seem to care at all, and I have lost both a crush and a friend. After all the tension and flirting we had, I thought any sort of intimacy we would have would be amazing and it was just horrible, and it was frankly his fault.  



I guess I just want advice on how do I actually move on from this? How do I stop obsessing and start focusing on myself again? I won’t see him at work unless I go out of my way since we are on different teams, but I just need to know how to get him, and what i thought we had, out of my head.

Just a guy who misses and looking for a girl that is fine with a casual intimacy. A girl who misses being touch, getting dominated, and getting babied in bed. A someone fine with being casual and not ready to commit in relationship. 

A someone that is not too aggressive, just a normal or soft girl that wants to be submissive. A girl that is open for giving blowjobs and hanjobs.

I'm open for inexperienced girls that wants to try getting eaten, fingers, or getting a dick inside you.

It could be a one time thing or a long term casual intimacy. Pero it's much nicer if it's long term.

We became quick friendsm grabbing coffee, joking around, checking in on each other, and I genuinely felt like I had found a safe, fun space with him at work.



There was always some light teasing/flirting, but nothing happened until recently, espeically since last summer we were both seeing other people. One night a few weejs ago we went out with friends, things got flirty, and we ended up back at his place. It was honestly kind of a weird hookup, he was drunk, it was very one-sided, we didn’t have sex, but the whole time was focused on pleaseing him, and there wasn’t much connection or affection. The next morning we both said we should talk, but when I brought it up a few days later, he literally said something along the lines of “I just want to deflect.” Since then, now like 2 weeks ago, he’s ghosted me, leaving my last message offering to grab him a coffee while I was at a coffee shop, on read.



This situation sucks because now it feels like I’ve lost both the possibility of something more *and* the friendship. I definitely had developed a crush on him, but more than that I miss our conversations, jokes, and having someone at work I could lean on. At the same time, I know his behavior says a lot and that I deserve better. The hardest part is that I literally can’t stop thinking about him. He has been on my mind 24/7 and none of the “work on yourself” “distract” etc, have helped, and I have never felt like this before . I feel stuck in my head replaying everything, wondering if our friendship was ever real, and struggling with the fact that he doesn’t seem to care at all, and I have lost both a crush and a friend. After all the tension and flirting we had, I thought any sort of intimacy we would have would be amazing and it was just horrible, and it was frankly his fault.  



I guess I just want advice on how do I actually move on from this? How do I stop obsessing and start focusing on myself again? I won’t see him at work unless I go out of my way since we are on different teams, but I just need to know how to get him, and what i thought we had, out of my head. ",2,1756688006.0,CallHerDaddy,0,1.0,False

I've been separated from my former spouse for about 6 months and was finally feeling like maybe I wanted to try to date again. I saw other couples around me and wasn't feeling jealous or angry, I just missed that feeling of having someone.

I downloaded some dating apps and within a week, I was ghosted twice, went on 1 date where I was basically sexually harassed, and went on another date where I was catfished. I went on one final date and it was so nice. We had a really good time. It progressed from coffee and a walk, to dinner, and then ended up back at his apartment.....

It was the first time I had had sex with someone else other than my spouse in a decade and it was the best sex I've ever had in my life. I tried to communicate that afterwards but I know it came out wrong because how do you tell someone you just met that they've completely changed my entire outlook on sex and my sexuality??? Either way, it doesn't matter. 2 days later, he told me he wasn't interested in seeing me again. I deleted the dating apps immediately after that and have been pretty depressed ever since.

I don't blame the guy at all for wanting nothing to do with me. I'm well aware I'm a walking red flag. I'm not even officially divorced yet. And I'm living with my parents again at the age of 29 while my ex-husband continues to live in our marital home. I have no idea when I will have enough money saved up to be able to move out and it's killing me. My life feels so stagnant and I can't do anything about it to change my circumstances. I feel like every time I try to have just a smidgen of happiness, I just get knocked back down again. I'm so tired of feeling sad and lonely all the time and I just wanted to feel connected with someone again. Will this ever get better? ",2,1756687971.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

  The prostitute he had brought home had left after awkward apologies and a good luck wish at finding my brother.  
  
  ""Kayli,"" Corey said to me through the cell phone I held to my ear. I could imagine him at the computer in the apartment, typing away. Hovering over the keyboard, his sun-kissed hair messed up in the same way I’d seen it earlier that day. “Are you sure he’s not with a friend?”  
  
  I hesitated. A few days ago, I got mixed up in a group of Academy boys who needed my help. In return, I was promised a lot of things, including assistance in helping get Wil into a college in a hurry and out of the godforsaken dump of a hotel we currently lived in. When I got back, Wil’s clothes, school books—most of his things--were gone. I’d been so worried about getting back to him and letting him know where I was, but the whole time he hadn’t been home. I wanted to believe Corey and think maybe he was at a friend’s house.  
  
  But I knew that wasn’t true. I could feel it. Like a piece of me was missing that couldn’t be replaced until I found him. He was gone. Someone may as well have chopped off my hand. “I know,” I said as coolly as I could, remembering this wasn’t Corey’s fault. “I’m telling you, he’s been missing for,” I counted off on my fingers, “what is it? Three days? Four? Ever since Marc first picked me up.”  
  
  “The school record shows he went to class all last week.”  
  
  I sucked in a heavy breath and held it, sitting up on the bed. I stared hard at the silent television, as if that held answers that my brain wasn’t able to put together in my panicked state. “He has?”  
  
  “Yeah,” he said. “He’s been going every day. He’s probably spending the night at a friend’s house.”  
  
  I stood up, and stumbled forward a step as I wasn’t sure what direction to start pacing first, and Marc’s clunky boots on my feet were hard to walk in. I glanced at the two notes sitting unfolded on top of the kitchenette counter next to an uneaten doughnut. All had been left for Wil, and none had been picked up, so I knew he hadn’t been by. He’d never spent the night at someone else’s house before. “I should...I don’t know. What am I doing standing here?” I asked, even though I already knew the answer. I was waiting because I didn’t know what to do next. I didn’t have a car so I couldn’t run off to find Wil, even if I wanted to. I didn’t know where to start now. I needed another pair of eyes. I needed Academy boys.  
  
  There was a hard pounding knock at the door; I felt the vibrations resonating through the floor. “Kayli!” Raven shouted.  
  
  I ran for the door. “Raven’s here,” I told Corey.  
  
  “Let me hang up on you and check in with Axel. He was heading out to the school district so he could check out any classmates who might have seen Wil. Don’t worry. We’ll find him.” He said goodbye and hung up.  
  
  I unlocked the door and got shoved back as it was pushed open from the other side. Raven towered in the doorway. He wore the same black T-shirt and sweatpants I’d seen him in a few hours earlier. He hadn’t bothered to change.  
Somehow that made me feel better. He took this as seriously as I felt.  
  
  His shoulders rolled back. His arms seemed to swell, making the tribal and rose tattoos on his forearms shift. His eyes darkened when he saw me and realized what a mess I was. “Tell me,” he said, the Russian accent thickening. “What happened?”  
  
  I stepped back from the door to let him in. “Where’s Marc?” I asked.  
  
  “He’s downstairs asking questions.” He lumbered forward, his eyes going all over the place, from the tiny hotel kitchenette, to where my father was with his bare ass hanging out, still passed out from whatever drunken stupor he’d been in from the night before. He nodded in Jack’s direction. “Did you ask him?”  
  
  “I can’t get a coherent sentence out of him,” I said, avoiding looking at Jack. The more I did, the angrier I got. I wanted to feel sorry for him, but it was getting harder and harder to drum up any sympathy. He lost his wife, my mother, years ago. Since then he’d fallen apart and drank his way through life. After all the crap he gave me during the times I tried to drag Wil with me to get away from him and his abuse, he chose now to not give a damn.  
  
  Raven went to the bed and leaned over, checking my father’s pulse at his neck. He split Jack’s eyelids open and checked his pupils. He released him, and wiped his fingers across his shirt as if to clean them. “We need to wake him. Make some coffee.”  
  
  “He won’t drink coffee.”  
  
  “Make some water,” he said. He bent over, grabbing Jack’s arm. He shoved it over his own shoulders and started to haul him up. “Open the bathroom door.”  
  
  I ran to the bathroom, opening it up and then dove in to push aside the shower curtain. Raven dragged him into the stall and dropped him on his butt onto the tile. I averted my eyes; I could see with my peripheral vision enough of what was going on, but avoided looking at Jack naked.  
  
  Raven leaned in and turned the cold water faucet on full blast.  
  
  It took a moment, but Jack started sputtering and opening his eyes, crying out. He rolled back and forth against the wall, trying to use it to haul himself back out of the unrelenting spray. His grimy face streaked as the water washed some of him clean. “Turn it off!” he howled.  
  
  “Get up,” Raven said. He positioned himself in front of Jack, for which I was grateful. I’d seen enough. Raven crossed his arms over his chest, standing out of striking distance if Jack decided to attack him, but still looming. “Where’s Wil?”  
  
  Jack coughed, long and hard and thickly enough that I thought he was trying to vomit. He reached up, turning off the water. He managed to twist the faucet until it was only dribbling and then scooted himself out of range. He rotated and peered up at Raven. “Who are you?”  
  
  “Kayli’s looking for Wil,” Raven said. “When’s the last time you saw him?”  
  
  “Hell if I know.” He cringed and then looked around Raven and spotted me behind him. “Who is this, Kayli?”  
  
  I clenched my hands into fists. He wasn’t listening at all. “Jack, Wil’s missing. I can’t find him.”  
  
  “Well, shit, tell me about it,” he said. He wiped water away from his face. “Get me a pair of pants, will you?”  
  
  I picked up a dirty pair of cotton pants he’d left in a corner of the bathroom and tossed them at him. I turned, looking at the wall. “You haven’t seen him at all?”  
  
  “I haven’t seen you, either. Not in a few days.” There were sounds behind me like he was stumbling into his pants and then a thud like he fell against the wall. “I thought he was with you.”  
  
  “I called you and told you to tell him I was at a job.”  
  
  “How am I supposed to keep up with either of you?” he bellowed.  
  
  “So you haven’t seen him at all?” Raven asked.  
  
  “Who the hell are you anyway?”  
  
  “I’m her boyfriend,” he said.  
  
  “What? How come I’ve never heard of you?”  
  
  I turned around. Jack stood, his short hair wet and stuck against his head, his face dripping. His bare belly hung over the waistband of the pants. Raven and Jack had squared off and were glowering at each other. I stared hard at Raven for a moment, trying to figure out if he was saying ‘boyfriend’ to keep things simple, and for some reason I took it like that. Seemed like the easiest thing to rattle off rather than just saying friend or, the real truth: that I’d just met him a few days ago and still barely knew him.  
  
  “He’s not helping,” I told Raven. “He doesn’t know.”  
  
  “Kayli?” Marc called. Footsteps sounded by the still-open door of the room. Marc nudged it further open as I stepped out to meet him. He spotted me and limped toward me, favoring one of his legs. His soft brown hair hung over in front of his mismatched eyes: one blue, one green. He gripped me by the elbows. “You okay? I...”  
  
  “Who is this?” Jack bellowed. He padded out into the main hotel room. “Why do you have all these boyfriends coming out of the woodwork? What kind of job were you at?”  
  
  Marc’s jaw hardened, making his high cheekbones stand out a little more. The black and brown plastic bands on his left wrist seemed to tighten against his arm as he made fists. He positioned himself in front of me, warding off Jack from getting any closer. “We’re here for her. We’re taking her with us.”  
  
  “What is this shit?” Jack said. He tried to look over at me from over Marc’s shoulder. “Kayli—”  
  
  Raven bumped into him on his way out of the bathroom almost knocking him over. He scanned the kitchenette again, and then the beds and the dresser. He spotted my two book bags on the floor by the beds. He picked them both up, slinging them over his shoulder, then turned to me. “Do you have anything else here? We’ll take it with us.”  
  
  “Hang on a second,” Jack said. He marched over to Raven, his finger pointed at him. “What the hell are you doing?”  
  
  “Someone should stay here,” I said, ignoring Jack. “I mean, maybe I should. If Wil comes back—”  
  
  “He’s not here and he hasn’t been back,” Marc said. “I checked the computer logs downstairs in the business center and I’ve asked the manager. He said he hasn’t seen him, only Jack.” He looked over where I’d opened up the drawers, finding them empty. “If he’s taken his things, he’s not planning on coming back. Not for a while.”  
  
  “But...”  
  
  “You don’t take all your things and plan on coming back,” he said. He grabbed my hand, tugging me to the door. “Come on.”  
  
  “Wait a second, you’re not dragging her out of here.” Jack stomped over. “Let go of her.”  
  
  Marc moved over again, blocking access. “She’s coming with us.”  
  
  Jack looked at me, his eyes wide and wild. “You can’t just leave here.”  
  
  “You mean you can’t find beer money without me?” I asked.  
  
  “Don’t give me that shit.”  
  
  “No,” I said. I yanked my arm out of Marc’s grasp and stepped toward Jack, getting in his face. I didn’t want to do it this way but I had no choice. He was my father, but I’d had enough and I was wound up too tight to stop now. “I was gone for four days and you didn’t give a damn. Wil’s gone and you’re not out looking for him. You don’t even care. You just want me here to pay for this hotel room and to give you money. I’m nothing to you but an income source. The only reason I was doing it at all was for Wil. He’s gone. So I’m gone, too.”  
  
  Jack clenched his hands and shoved one toward me. “You selfish little...after everything I’ve done...”  
  
  Raven clamped down on Jack’s wrist and twisted. Jack bent over backward to relieve the pressure. He howled and clawed at Raven’s grasp. Raven pushed back until Jack was on his knees and then shoved.  
  
  “Don’t touch her,” Raven said in a cold, deep voice.  
  
  Jack held his arms up in defense, easing himself up. “Fine. Take her.” He focused on me, pointing a finger. “You think I need you? You don’t know anything about nothing.”  
  
  I ground my teeth together to stop myself from arguing. Over the years, I’d dreamed of the day I would walk out on him and let him  
rot in his own mess. Now that it was here and I was doing it, all the words I’d wanted to spit at him didn’t want to appear. Did it even matter? Nothing I could say would make any of this right.  
  
  But why was there that persistent nag at my heart? Maybe it was because I still had a picture of him in my mind of what he used to be. Before my mother died, he’d kept a job, even if it wasn’t a good one and didn’t pay very well. He wasn’t always the friendliest, but he’d worked hard and kept us kids in line. It was what you’d want in a dad, at the least.  
  
  How could he dare ask me to stay, and beg me with those eyes that looked struck and horrified? After all the fights? After becoming a bum and forcing us to cart him around while we barely survived? He’d given up on us.  
  
  “You have about a month,” I said as coolly as I could muster. I could leave him that at least. It relieved some of the guilt over abandoning him like a helpless animal. “The hotel room has been paid until then. If you don’t cause too much trouble, and they don’t have a reason to kick you out.”  
  
  Jack’s lips twisted and his head jerked back. “You shrewd girl. You’ve been holding back money? Paid a month? For this place?”  
  
  “Come on, Kayli,” Marc urged. He reached out for my wrist and tugged. “We should go.”  
  
  “You’re an idiot,” Jack called after me. “The rent is outrageous here. I was going to move us somewhere else. After the next check came in, I was going to...”  
  
  I turned from Marc, looking back at Jack. What was he babbling about? “What check?”  
  
  Jack shook his head. “You think you’re going to get a dime from me? You’ve got to be kidding. After all I’ve done to teach you to fend for yourself.”  
  
  “Teach me?” I asked. My shoulders drew back and I pointed a finger at him. “You mean drinking all our money and getting into fights at night until we were nearly out in the street? You couldn’t afford a cardboard box.”  
Stop, Kayli,” Marc said, tugging again, gentler this time. “He’s just egging you on.”  
  
  “What check?” I asked Jack again.  
  
  “You think I need you?” Jack shoved a finger back at my face. “It doesn’t matter if Wil is here as long as he’s going to school and the cops don’t catch him living somewhere. And if you’re both off on your own, then the state may reduce it, but I can still live on...”  
  
  It was like ice water striking at my very heart. “You...” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “You get checks from the state?”  
  
  “You think I do nothing around here?” he bellowed. “You think I can’t support myself? You think your little contribution makes you tough shit?”  
  
  I smashed my fists against my thighs to stop myself from hurling them at his face. My mouth clamped shut and I was biting my tongue so hard, I tasted the blood boiling inside me. “How long?” I managed to utter.  
  
  “None of your business what I do with my money,” he said. “You dropped out of school and have been running around. When I stopped providing for you and your brother, you straightened up and worked and finally started contributing.”  
  
  Raven held up a hand between us. “This isn’t the time for this. Wil is still gone.”  
  
  But the revelation struck me hard. My father had lied to me. Lied about having money. He lost his job, and didn’t even try to look for another one. It’s why I’d dropped out of school. I’d started working part time jobs where I could get them. And when it wasn’t enough, I started stealing what I needed by picking pockets at the mall. Even then, we got kicked out of our old apartment and Jack convinced us we should stay at the hotel until we found another. But this whole time, I had been the only one paying the bills and contributing. Jack left nearly every afternoon when the bars opened to drink and pay for hookers out of the money I’d brought home for rent.  
  
  And now he tells me he’s been getting government assistance all along. Possibly using me and Wil the entire time as the state helped pay for what we needed. Only the money went to Jack. He must have drank it all. Gave it away to those hookers.  
  
  My rage bubbled over. I lunged at him. I wailed. I screamed. Marc tried to pull me back, but I wrenched myself free. Raven dropped my bags and wrapped an arm around my waist and pulled me back, but not before I clawed at Jack’s face with a good swipe. Even then, it wasn’t enough.  
  
  “How could you?” I screamed at him as Raven started carrying me to the door. “We needed you and you kept it all to yourself? We were starving!”  
  
  “Get out!” Jack bellowed after me. “Ungrateful little shithead!”  
  
  A slew of curses fell from my lips as Raven towed me out. I fought him, but not as hard as I could have because he wasn’t the one I wanted to kill.  
  
  I was a mess, upside down, seeing red and choking on sobs as Raven brought me to the parking lot. Marc followed, carrying the book bags that Raven had dropped. His head was down and he stared at his feet as we left. He opened the truck and threw my bags into the back seat. Raven put me down in the passenger side and then shoved me over until I was in the middle.  
  
  Raven got inside, slamming the door. “Skatert'yu doroga.”  
  
  “Good riddance is right,” Marc said. He jammed the key into the slot and started the truck.  
  
  I sat back against the seat. My eyes were open and I was staring at the windshield, but I wasn’t really looking at anything. I was trying to contain the anger that now threatened to consume everything inside of me.  
  
  I’d been gripping Raven’s thigh after he got in. As he settled, he snatched up my hand and squeezed. Then he opened up his arm and pulled me into him until I was leaning against his chest. He gripped at my shoulder, clutching me.  
  
  I let him. And in a way, his strength allowed some of my anger to flow away. Marc drove and then glanced at us. His hand drifted out, and he gripped my knee.  
  
  None of us said anything. We didn’t need to. We all knew.  
  
  I’d never see Jack again.  
  
  But what about Wil?  
  
  CALCULATED MOVES  
  
  The bubbling anger in my throat wouldn’t settle. Staring through the windshield didn’t help. My fists kept balling up against my thighs.  
  
  I handled things pretty well for someone whose life was in upheaval. As of this moment, I had no home, no brother, and no family. I didn’t have a dollar to my name, no job, and probably had a billionaire playboy mad at me for wrecking his yacht. And shooting him in the leg.  
  
  Marc was focused on the road.  
  
  I’d known him for only a few days. During that time, I managed to put a nail through his thigh, run out on him twice, kiss him a handful of times, wanted to do it again, and if that wasn’t enough of a start, he knew every last bit about my life and I still knew hardly anything about him. He was an ex-thug who now belonged to a new gang...undercover division...I didn’t know what, really. Their group was called only Academy. What kind of name was that?  
  
  Raven had his elbow propped up on the door and he was staring out the window. He called himself a professional Russian. I wasn’t sure what Russians were professionals of, but so far I knew he could handle any sized weapon you gave him, and he knew how to blow things up. Sexy ran through his blood just like his heritage. He had a lip ring, and occasionally he fiddled with it with his tongue, causing it to protrude out. The tattoos on his body, his broad stature, and the harsh stare he gave made him one of the few people I actually thought could take down a person with a single punch. So far I was on his good side. I never wanted to know the bad one.  
  
  They were both a mega problem because I hadn’t wanted to return, and they were the only ones I thought I could call, outside of the police--and I didn’t want to go there. Most of me wanted to search for Wil on my own. I’d swallowed back a lot of pride to call them for help, thinking their Academy skill set could help me find him faster than I could on my own. Making sure Wil was safe was the only thing that drove me to call them in the first place.  
  
  Maybe.  
  
  I was a thief...an ex-thief, new to standing on the better side of the law. I knew how to pick pockets, and occasionally I could lie my ass off to get out of a sticky situation. I had brown hair, light green eyes and decent cleavage. With enough mascara and gloss, and a low-cut top, I could turn a head or two, or wear boy clothes and go unnoticed.  
  
  We’d only been driving for a few minutes, but every mile was agony. I was ripping myself out from a world I’d always been in, and now completely lost and dependent on the guys and I hated it. The worst was, I didn’t have a choice. I could walk out into the street and leave, but I was going to start with absolutely nothing, not even a place to stay. My original plan to get on my feet before I saw any of the guys again had failed before it even started.  
  
  Wil was still missing.  
  
  “Corey said Wil was going to school,” I said, breaking the silence. This bit of information felt oddly important, but in my stressed out state, I wanted a clearer head to spell it out for me.  
  
  “He is?” Marc asked. He turned his head, his mismatched eyes taking on an eerie glow from the lights in the dashboard since it was already dark outside. When I nodded, he shifted and pulled his phone out and started typing into it.  
  
  “What are you doing?” I asked, glancing nervously at the road and his texting and driving.  
  
  “Checking in with Axel.”  
  
  “Here,” I said, snatching the phone from his hand. There wasn’t much traffic along the interstate, but he was laying on the accelerator and I didn’t trust other drivers.  
  
  “Hey,” Marc said, though he reclaimed the wheel with both hands. “It’s not nice to snatch stuff.”  
  
  “It’s illegal to text and drive. And I don’t particularly want to die today because you’re not paying attention.”  
  
  “You’re going to talk to me about illegal—”  
  
  Raven reached over, thunking Marc on the head. “She’s right.”  
  
  Marc made a noise but didn’t argue.  
  
  I focused on the phone, where Marc had started to s  
end a text to Axel. I tapped at the screen to finish up. Raven hovered over my shoulder, watching what I was doing.  
  
  Marc: Wil’s been going to school? Any update from classmates?  
  
  Raven continued to hover over me as we waited for a response. He pointed to the screen on the phone. “What’s that one?” he asked.  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “That word,” he said, and he pointed to the phone’s screen.  
  
  I wondered if he was playing some joke on me and I wasn’t getting it. “Update?”  
  
  “Oh,” he said. “Update. Never mind. I know that one.”  
  
  “He’s still learning to read,” Marc said. “English isn’t exactly the easiest language to learn.”  
  
  “It’s fucking hard,” Raven said.  
  
  It was odd to think of Raven not being able to read so well. He wasn’t stupid. He was learning a new language. I didn’t know any bit of another language, so I couldn’t imagine what he had to go through to learn English.  
  
  I wanted to comment on this but the phone shook in my hands.  
  
  Axel: Confirmed. Administrative records say he’s been to class. No word on where he’s staying.  
  
  I read the text to the boys. I sat back, staring ahead. “He’s going to class,” I said.  
  
  “Of course he is,” Marc said. “He’s smarter than I was.”  
  
  I turned my head, looking at Marc’s profile and expecting him to say more. When he didn’t do it fast enough, I nudged him. “What?”  
  
  “When I left home,” he said, “I didn’t go to school. Hell, school was half of the reason why I left. The thing is, if you leave school, it’s the school that starts calling around, talking to the police. They have to, you know? If he’s going to school, he’s staying off police and official radars.”  
  
  Marc told me before he was part of a gang when he was younger. I wanted to ask if that was why he left school but skipped it for now. More important things to do. “So...” I said, trying to put our next step together. Anger welled inside me, clouding my thoughts as heavily as the dark surrounding us. Stressing over where I would stay until I found Wil, wondering whether he was starving or dead in a gutter, despite knowing he’d been going to school, the ideas wouldn’t go away. There was also the possibility of my past catching up with me that hampered my ability to consider my options. The more I became confused, the more I wanted to pummel both Marc and Raven as a way to release the pent-up anger and allow me to think.  
  
  Raven’s arm slid around my shoulders, drawing me in tight. He grabbed my hands with one of his and held them together at the wrist, as if reading my mind that was trying to connect the dots and needed a punching bag. “It means we wait until Monday. We show up at the school and ask him where he’s been.”  
  
  I wanted to say okay, that it sounded like a reasonable answer, but it was Saturday night which left a whole day for my brother to be out there alone. It felt wrong to simply give up on looking for him, but I didn’t have an alternate answer except for knocking on every door in the city until I found him. I didn’t want my panic to cause more problems, and was trying my best to be reasonable, to swallow the pit of fear and think of this rationally.  
  
  “There’s a team out at that school, isn’t there?” Marc asked, glancing over at Raven. His lips twisted, and a wrinkle formed between his eyebrows, contorting his face into a confused expression as he looked at Raven holding me like he was. “What’s wrong?”  
  
  “She’s angry,” Raven said as plain as telling him the time.  
  
  Marc drove in silence for a few moments like he didn’t understand this and then looked back at him. “So?”  
  
  “You’re driving,” he said. “I don’t want a wreck.”  
  
  Marc grunted. “Okay, well, text Axel and have him contact the other team. Have them keep an eye out for him. We can put a flag out at the police station and the hospitals—”  
  
  “No,” I said, twisting my wrists, trying to get Raven to let go, but he was too strong. “You can’t tell the police.”  
  
  “I’m not telling them,” Marc said. “It’s just a flag. If anyone shows up with the same description as your brother, we’ll be notified. We don’t have to call them. The flag will call us.”  
  
  “You can do that without getting him into trouble?”  
  
  “We can do a lot of things,” Marc said.  
  
  I sensed that by we he meant the Academy could do things. If they could help, I wanted it. I’d worry about repaying them later.  
  
  Raven took the phone from me, and slowly released me when I didn’t protest or hit him. He sent text messages to Axel and Corey with instructions.  
  
  What else could I do? If I went crazy looking for Wil, someone would call the police. They’d drag him back to Jack. They might look closer at us, at me. Would it do either of us any good?  
  
  Wil had been going to school. He’d been doing what he was supposed to. He just wasn’t at the hotel. He wasn’t going to tell me he was leaving? Did he think I wasn’t going to look for him?  
  
  If I hadn’t for three days, did he assume now I didn't care at all?  
  
  The anger inside of me reduced, and at the same time, my stomach started to growl. I hadn’t eaten since breakfast.  
  
  Raven passed the phone back over to Marc and then focused on me. His scowl deepened. “Hungry?”  
  
  Guess he heard my stomach. “Yeah.”  
  
  Raven nudged Marc in the shoulder and then pointed out the window. “There’s a McDonald’s.”  
  
  “We’ve got food at home,” Marc said. “We’re almost there.”  
  
  “Let’s go. I feel like chicken.”  
  
  Marc grunted but took the off ramp.  
  
  Twenty minutes later, we had three bags of McNuggets and fries. I had a milkshake but Marc told Raven to just have soda at home.  
  
  Marc passed the bags over to Raven. Raven pulled out one of the boxes of nuggets and held it out to me.  
  
  “Not in the car,” Marc said.  
  
  “She’s hungry now,” Raven said.  
  
  “She’s not two. She can wait.”  
  
  I stuffed two nuggets into my mouth and chewed, staring right at Marc.  
  
  Marc slapped me on the thigh. “Spoiled brat, stop it. You’ll get the car dirty.”  
  
  I slapped him back, chewing still and my mouth was too full to say anything. I should have been nicer since he bought me food, but I was really hungry. He glared at me, putting up a hand like he’d pop me on the leg again if I went for another nugget.  
  
  “If you let her eat,” Raven said, “she gets nice.”  
  
  “What?” Marc asked, relaxing his hand. “What do you mean?”  
  
  “I mean if you feed her, she stops hitting you. She won’t even be angry anymore.”  
  
  Marc squinted at him and then at me. “Is he serious?”  
  
  I shrugged, stuffing another nugget into my mouth. “Doesn’t hurt,” I said. I sucked down the milkshake. I wasn’t going to argue if I got food out of the deal.  
  
  Marc studied me as he continued to drive into downtown Charleston. I wasn’t sure what he was waiting for. I was too engrossed in eating to put much thought into it.  
  
  “How’d you know?” Marc asked Raven after a few minutes. “She’s all quiet now and her face isn’t all twisted like it gets when she’s angry.”  
  
  “I’m the same way,” he said. He reached out for a nugget from my open box but I pulled it back and then slapped his hand away. He still managed to snag one and popped it into his mouth. He licked his thumb and finger, causing the ring in his lip to stick out again. “I’ve still got the fries,” he said.  
  
  I didn’t care if he was Russian and huge. I’d kill him for a fry. I punched him in the arm but he punched me back. I rubbed the spot where he hit me and made a grab for the bag. “Give me,” I said.  
  
  “Okay,” he said, grinning. “Maybe she does calm down, but better not get between her and food or she’ll attack you again.” He opened the bag. “I’m getting the hang of her.”  
  
  “Leave some for the others,” Marc said.  
  
  By the time we got to the Sergeant Jasper, Raven and I had split o  
ur first box of nuggets and a large container of fries. I didn’t bug him to open another box, even if I wanted some. It would do until we were sitting inside one of the apartments.  
  
  In the parking lot, I stared at the brown brick building. The drab severity contrasted with the nearby bay, palm trees and general picturesque views surrounding it. I hadn’t thought I’d see it again so soon, and it was surreal to be back. Since I was homeless, I wasn’t going to complain, but again there was an awkwardness. I didn’t want to obligate the boys to take me in because they were the only ones I knew who would. How long would they let me stay this time? Until we found Wil? I didn’t know what to do after.  
  
  Why did it feel like I wanted to be here? The sight of the Sergeant Jasper made the anger in my heart ease. I didn’t feel this way going back to the hotel. Raven opened the truck door the moment we were parked and jumped out. He held the door open for me. The moment I hobbled out next to him, he slammed the door and started in. Marc grabbed my book bags and headed in, too, and they quietly walked beside me, like there was no question that I should be going with them. There were more than a few reasons I shouldn’t stay with them like this, even if they invited me in. But it was an odd feeling — it felt right. I squashed the feelings down, not wanting to get too carried away.  
  
  For now, though, with Wil being gone, I gave in instead of arguing about it. This was just for now.  
  
  In the downstairs lobby, the uniformed night guard was at her post reading a thick romance novel. She glanced up from her book, took a small look at us, smiled and then went back to her reading. Did she really know who we were or did she not care? Was she any sort of deterrent from thugs coming in and just going upstairs?  
  
  We were the only ones in the elevator on the way up. On the seventh floor, Marc bypassed his own door and went for Corey’s and Brandon’s apartment a few doors down. He knocked twice and then three times and then once and waited.  
  
  “Is that some sort of code?” I asked.

Do you think the coffee shop owner could have survived if:

A) He made better coffee
B) He refunded the money back
C) Either way, he was doomed from the start

Curious to hear everyone’s take on this. Was the Rampager making moral judgments, or was he just using excuses to justify the spree?

The bar has been raised. 

Just like when Shib and the likes changed the space before, the biggest runners will be this AltSeason will be those who revolutionise the game this time around.

Kendu has both IRL efforts and social media efforts expanding on the foundations laid by Shib in 2021. In my opinion, IRL efforts are the main way that crypto will evolve. AI use, bot use and general bad actors in the space have caused investors to be very wary before having a stake in the game. This is where Kendu comes in, IRL efforts are a perfect way to show **Proof of Humanity** and that Kendu is something real and physical that will not disappear in an instant

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I might be forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! SO much more is coming soon
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping
* Kendu Press 
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers

As you can see this is an insane catalogue and all developed by the average person, there is no team in Kendu. This is all under 20 million market cap too! Once the average person has more money as Kendu's market cap increases, so many currently sidelined initiatives will be announced and released. There is gonna be a tsunami of new efforts.

The future is so clear and all the signs are there...

**Kendu is arguably the best investment you can make right now**

1n5azn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/higherpowermanifest/comments/1n5azn2/how_to_live_in_the_end/,How to ‘Live in the End’,"Everyone keeps asking how to “live in the end” THIS is how!!!!!!

to ‘live in the end’ is not meant to be taken literally.

It’s not about pretending you have the thing. 

It’s about treating what you do have NOW like it’s already enough.

Because if you really believed your dream life was on its way, or already unfolding, or already here!! you would be obsessed with the present. You would be in love with life right now! You would be happy! kind! excited! full of love!!!!!

But no one wants to do this.
Because it’s simple!!! but not easy.
It means slowing down. Feeling. Being grateful. 

it doesn’t mean pretend your soulmate is next to you.

it doesn’t mean act like you’re rich when you’re broke.

it means:
live like what you have now is everything you ever wanted. wow! you are living a dream!!!

so try this:

look at your life, the bed you sleep in, the sky, the coffee, the quiet.

and decide that this is it. this is the life you dreamed of.

romanticise the tiniest things!!!!
 
and let that energy spill into your body like sunlight.

be thankful! be kind! share love! 

this is the cheat code to manifesting! 

that’s what makes you magnetic.

this is how you get everything you want!!!!

1n5ayzp,https://i.redd.it/9fomm18j7gmf1.jpeg,Roast my farmstand,"I’ve wanted to have a small roadside stand in my community FOREVER, and this summer was finally the year to make it happen. However it’s just… not performing. At all. I’ll sell eggs consistently but that’s it, and my flock is slowing down because it’s almost fall. I’m not in it for the money, but I’ve watched so many sad little wilted bouquets go in the compost because no one wants them, and it’s getting pretty demoralizing. 

What am I doing wrong? Here’s some more context: 

I live near a massive golf course (unfortunately lol) on a relatively busy road for the area and have the stand out every Sunday, 8am to 8pm. I advertise on social media (have removed my farm name here for obvious reasons but it is on the stand). My area’s main industry is tourism, so we have lots of those folks especially in the summer but there’s a steady undercurrent of blue-collar and agricultural families here too. 

Here’s a typical list of what I’d have stocked and for how much: 

Eggs - $2 per half dozen / 
Little bouquets of zinnias, cosmos, etc - $5 / 
Knit dishcloths - $3 each / 
Knit coffee cup sleeves - $10 each (they all have seasonal patterns and different colors) / 
Hardneck garlic bulbs - $1 to $1.50 each / 
Carrots - $3 per 1lb bunch / 
Herbal tea - $7 per bag (makes about 20 cups) 

Of course, I can’t afford the official organic certification, but none of my crops or flowers are sprayed with anything. I rely on birds, beneficial predatory insects, native plants, and a whole lot of weeding to successfully grow things.

I just don’t get why people around here pass up food that’s local, fresh, organic, for all intents and purposes, weekend after weekend after weekend. Is my stand too small? In a bad spot?

Anyway I started passing and people started calling me buddy, and I was like, oh lol, I know about this! Sick, I'm getting buddy zoned. I don't mind that at all tbh, but the other day this absolute vertical giant of a man called me boss when I gave him his coffee and I was stunned. 

I find it a little difficult not to laugh when people call me either because for me it's like this strictly online phenomena that's coming to life in front of my eyes that I wasn't expecting.

1n5awz4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5awz4,AIO for being upset my sister always touches my things without my permission?,"context: me ( 18F ) and my sister ( 21F ) got into a fight about two days ago because she wore one of my new outfits to work ( she works in a cafe so she only usually wears old clothes because she handles coffees and foods so things get messy quickly ) and she had gotten it dirty. this resulted in a physical altercation between me and her because when she arrived home i asked her to take it off so i could quickly put it the wash because i don't know what it was dirtied with so i didn't know if it would stain as it was an outfit i still hadn't got to wear yet and was still looking forward to wearing. she said she would but after an hour of waiting and ignoring me every time i would ask her to take it off i got angry and tried to remove it from her myself. i did warn her i would do so if she didn't hand it over of her own volition in which she laughed at me so obviously my anger bubbled over and the aforementioned happened. after some back and forth arguing, screaming and crying i eventually just left and i haven't spoken to her since.

for some backstory, my sister started majorly power tripping around the time she hit 16 ( we have a 4 year age gap so i was like 12 ). by this i mean she would blatantly disrespect me and sometimes even my mum, constantly ignore and disregard me, dismiss me whenever i asked something of her because she felt she didn't have to listen to the likes of me, harm me physically if arguments got too out of hand and when i had enough and started fighting back verbally and physically ( i think i was around 14 or 15 ) was when things started taking a turn for the worst. i am an emotionally sensitive person but that doesn't mean i won't stand up for myself, however this also meant i couldn't help but feel bad at times because there were situations where i would have trouble with people at school and she would defend me or we would play pranks on my mum and just thinking about that stuff would upset me after i would lash out at her from holding in too much or arguing. i should also probably mention that these emotional highs and lows took a toll on my mental health and worsened my depression, so in these recent events, the feeling that no one had any regard for how i was feeling definitely played a part in turning my sadness into anger.

explanation: i have 2 pairs of shoes, a pair of grey jordan's that i wear when out and a pair of mash up panda dunks that i only wear when skating because i don't like wearing sliders outside and they are easy to slip on and off ( for avoiding security in malls and car parks lolol ). my sister's job comes with a pretty good hourly wage so of course she has many luxury and designer brands, including around 5 or 6 good pairs of shoes and 2 pairs of shoes for work only. today i was clearing out my wardrobe and noticed my jordan's were missing, i hadn't gone out recently so i had to reason to even touch my wardrobe. i immediately thought she took them but seeing as she has two pairs of work shoes i didn't see the point, especially when we had already fight the other day about this exact issue. when she came home, in my shoes, i didn't say anything or make a scene i just calmly texted my mum to please deal with her when she's home from work whilst seething on the inside because i knew nothing good would come from confronting her myself. the screenshots above is the conversation i had with my mum  pertaining to that text.

so am i overreacting for being upset? i feel like i'm crazy and i don't want to speak to any of my friends about this so please be frank and honest!",0,1756687508.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.5,False
1n5awvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NashvilleUnfiltered/comments/1n5awvq/a_warning_to_anyone_thinking_about_applying_to/,"A warning to anyone thinking about applying to work with Urban Botanics Design LLC in Nashville, TN","This is the current job posting on glass door: “We are seeking a dedicated and detail-oriented Plant Care Specialist to join our team. This position is responsible for the maintenance and care of interior foliage plants at high-end Hotel and Commercial properties in downtown Nashville, TN. The ideal candidate will ensure the health, appearance, and overall presentation of the plants, using best practices in horticultural care. This is an onsite role, requiring travel to various hotel properties. You will work closely with a caring Management team that takes pride in assisting with your professional development.” 

It’s ironic that she is saying you will work with a caring management team because that was not my experience at all. Quite the opposite actually. The owner puts on a good performance that she actually cares but she is greedy and keeps taking on as many clients as she can but won’t hire more people to cover that workload. She will overload you with work without compensating you for the extra workload. She also asked me to lie about breach of contact with the main hotel she has contracted with. She signed a contract to have someone there full time but is asking you to sneak around and not tell anyone that you are in fact working for 5 other properties. She wouldn’t hire enough people to cover the actual work load and would rather pay one person to do the work of two people. I was taking care of thousands of plants across 5 hotels and one coffee shop on my own. My health was deteriorating and she never even considered stopping for lunch or ever making sure anyone even has a moment to stay hydrated on extremely hot days in the summer. I had to set many boundaries with her and still didn’t feel respected. Both her and her only other employee teased me about my age very early on saying I was “just a baby” even though I’m 31 and brought extensive plant knowledge and experience to the team. Neither of them work well in a team. You will have very little support.  You are an afterthought and she will expect you to take on the responsibilities of business partner rather than employee. There is no planning ahead or organization. Just chaos and good luck trying to understand how to communicate with them. In addition her only other employee was sexually harassing me and making the work environment feel even more unprofessional and unsafe. It seems like a good opportunity at first but trust me you will be regretting it. Hope this helps someone find what’s right for them and avoid this money hungry, capitalistic company that prioritizes quick financial gains on your back over any long term stability for its employees. Save yourself the burnout.

I (32F) live in Oshawa, but I like to frequent downtown Toronto. I’m looking for other female friends that are kind of on the same level as me socially if it makes sense. 

For context, I do have friends here. But they are very much in the bar/party/drink all night phase, and I feel like I am getting a bit distant from them all because I find this life style to be exhausting on me physically and mentally. I like to genuinely connect with people and have deep talks.

I’m looking for other girlies that can be mellow and chill with/talk to me. Here are some things I like that I feel like my “current friends” don’t relate to me on. DM if you wanna chat about any!

•crappy reality tv. My comment history says it all.

• art. Would LOVE someone down to go to places like the AGO. I am a painter by hobby, so I’d be down for some paint nights or gallery walks.

•live music. This one is huge for me. I love rock, punk, metal, etc. my brother is the singer of a punk band that frequents Toronto as well. It’s a great vibe and would love to take people along for once that actually appreciate local bands. I’d LOVE someone who wants to go to shows or jam. I like to sing, play piano and guitar, and would be down to play with someone as well.

•Food!!!love sushi, Italian food, trying new coffee shops/cuisines.

•sports: not as frequent but I go to a couple Jays and Leafs games every year and absolutely love them. 

•anything spooky really: always down to watch a scary documentary/movie, do ghost tours/haunted house walks etc.

•lastly, REALLY wish I had someone who was into nature as my friends are not: I love to camp, go for hikes (mild ones, nothing difficult or crazy), love being by a lake, sitting on the beach, etc. my friends do not even do this even though we live near so many beautiful trails and lakes.

I’ve been with my boyfriend 9 months. I’ve known this girl even longer but we didn’t hang out nearly as much and didn’t talk at all for a few months. I love my boyfriend in a familial sense - I feel a great deal of loyalty and care for him. I thought I liked him romantically but since I’ve remet this girl I feel like nothing I felt for him even compares to what I feel for her in terms of sheer chemistry and attraction. We have much more in common and she’s my “type” - partially because I think she’s super cute and also partially because she’s a girl. I thought I was lesbian as a teen yet I decided to date men out of fear of going to Hell and not being able to have biological children. For the first few months I was scared that I wasn’t attracted to him but eventually I got over that. But now I think it might’ve been true.

People around us have commented on how close we’ve become so fast. We cosplay together, go for coffee together, talk about philosophy, anime, religion… and she understands what it’s like to have a complicated relationship with your parents. I really feel a connection with her and I think she acts eager to talk to me in a way she isn’t with others. Doesn’t necessarily mean she’s romantically to me but I do think the chemistry is felt by both of us. She’s probably straight. She’s quite open with me, sends me selfies and asks for my own, but that’s just because we’re fashionable. My feelings are probably unrequited.

But even if she does want a relationship with me I don’t think it’s a good idea. My boyfriend would be crushed if I left him for someone else - that’s not arrogance that’s just a fact, I know him. And we have our future planned out, he has a good job we can support a family with including my job, and he’s a good guy really… I think if I leave my boyfriend for this new girl I might end up seriously regretting it. But my friends are telling me that that’s a bad move and that I need to follow my heart and “stop repressing my sexuality” (not that I’ve ever done that). But yeah I don’t think it’s a good idea but I wanna hear other perspectives cuz I don’t wanna regret my choice. ",0,1756687113.0,changemyview,26,0.14,False

When his voice shakes the walls, and when his hands remind me I live life on a leash. When the silence after feels heavier than the screaming was a few minutes prior. 

Tonight I walked in drunk and shivering, barely holding myself together with nothing but willpower and a muddy old jacket. No one sees that I’m missing a shoe, or that my hair is caked with remnants of the same mud. I slid into a booth, asked for coffee, and wrapped both of my hands around the mug searching for some semblance of warmth.

The yellow sign didn’t save me, but it was my solace. It didn’t fix anything. But inside, it’s quieter. The grill hisses, the lights buzz in their old familiar way, the silverware clinks, and somehow I can finally think again. The static inside my head finally stops, even if just for a second. The whole room feels frozen, like time has stopped to give me a break.

I drink the coffee. Bitter, scalding, bottomless, like it always is. It’s probably the worst coffee I’ve ever had, but I drink it eagerly. The waitress tops it off without a word, just a polite smile. The cook calls out orders, but doesn’t look back at me. Nobody looks too close. Nobody sees me. And that’s what I need. Not help, not rescue. Just this tiny moment of silence where I can feel without interruption.

But I know it won’t last. The cup will  run empty and dry. The sun will rise and storms will call for me. And I’ll still have to go home. Back to him. Back to the same apologies, the same bruises, the same cycle that we’ve both sworn won’t happen again, even though I know it will. Back to bare feet against cold, peeling linoleum, and crystal tears. 

I tell myself I’m strong enough to handle it. I tell myself love looks like patience, like forgiveness, like waiting for the good days to outweigh the bad. I can forgive. But, I know I’m lying. I know I’m trapped. The lies just taste sweeter than the truth, and I need honey coating to breathe most days.

So I put a few bills on the counter, stand up slow, and step back into the night. The Waffle House doesn’t stop me. It just watches me leave, its soft glow spilling out across the parking lot of sludge and trash. For one second, I think about staying.

And then I don’t.

1n5ann8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1n5ann8/the_professor_10b/,The Professor 10b,"When the professor woke up he had a quick breakfast and started writing. . The more you wrote the more he felt like something was missing. He had looked at newspapers, yeah down a bunch of interviews. What in the world could be missing? 

""Professor"" he told himself ""sometimes even brilliant people will get moments of stupidity.""

Wyatt Staples is what he was missing. The entire story started with him and I do not know his side of the story. 

He could try to contact him but he did not want to bring up tragic events just out of the blue. Well I am going to start at the basics by interviewing the Staples and see where it goes from there. 

He called up a car share and headed to the Staples early. He was not surprised when he arrived at the Staples that nobody was home. 

You saw Mr Winslow sitting on the porch painting. He went over and sat with him pulling a package out of his backpack. He handed over the package to Mr Winslow. 

""I used to paint a lot but in the past 5 years I found myself with less and less time to paint. These are rare and very hard to find paints which I am sure you will put to good use.""

The old man was completely surprised. The fact that these paints were very expensive did not impress him it's the facts they were so hard to find. And it's typical way he nodded and said thank you.

""Would you mind if I interviewed you on Wyatt and the incident. More information I have the better we can protect him.""the professor asked 

""Professor, I know I have a way of calling things the way I see them. I see you taking out the camera. Please keep my name confidential and also do not feel my face.""

The professor agreed and set up the camera behind the old man showing only the back of his head and the easel in front of him.

The professor ""so when did you first meet the young victim that survived is incident.""

Mr. W. ""I am not sure when exactly but the young lad was about 2 years old when the family moved in.""

The professor ""how were your interactions with the family.""

Mr W ""at first distant. I would be grumpy and the family would smile and still wave at me. Even the young lad would wave which made me smile on the inside. 

As the oldest brothers were born and started growing up the eldest true his example thought his Brothers to respect my property and always be point. Before I knew it the youngest boys were waving and saying good morning just like their parents did and brother.

The professor ""when and where did you hear about the incident.""

Mr W *this was big news here and at first all we could get was Daddy that the ship Wyatt, oops you're going to have to beep that, the young lad was on was attacked by Drazzon.

Finally they put out a list of survivors but a much longer list of those that had passed. I was very happy my young neighbor had survived but I knew he would be traumatized. ""

The professor ""did you see any interviews of survivors from that day.""

Mr. W. ""At first the news showed many of those children in shock. It seems like they were trying to coach children they interviewed into saying how great the Lord was for saving all their lives those interviews seemed staged so they stop doing them.

Then that pumpus, jackass blue blood did an interview where you declared to the world how brave he had been saving all these children. How he stealthily and managed to escape to get reinforcements. 

I used to be auxilia long enough to know when a coward blue blood is lying. I was so mad that I broke my TV and eventually had to replace it.""

The professor ""so I heard that you help the young lad heal from this tragedy?""

Mr. W ""in that case you heard wrong. I did not help the young lad heel. All I did was offer advice and escapism by teaching him how to paint.

No damn blue blood, or psychologists, or any other type of therapy could have helped him heal. 

All is family and myself did was be there for him when he needed advice and sometimes a nudge in the right direction. All the healing should be credited to the young lad. 

All I know is is used to be terrified of trees and dark. Every painting that he painted had shadows and darkness. Then one day is paintings were no longer dark. Is panties were brighter and even though he was no longer dark he still kept to himself and surprisingly he was no longer afraid of anything.""

The professor ""do you know about him having to change schools and nicknames he acquired like lying Wyatt?""

Right after the incident the interviewed  Wyatt, oops again beep it. Like I said Mr professor when it comes to lieyers I am a professional and from what I saw in those interviews the young lad was telling the truth and nothing but the truth. He openly spoke about the noble and recounted everything he heard including that Noble sacrificing so many lives to save his own. 

I will try to quote that pompous blue blood in what he said in interviews.

""That young commoner must be traumatized and does not remember the facts or you must be outright lying. 

I used my cunning and wisdom to escape from the Drazzan. If it was not for my dedication and bravery no one would have survived the attack.""

I knew this lying piece ... blue blood was lying and this poor commoner Survivor was telling the truth. 

After that interview the young lad withdrew inside himself. He barely spoke to anyone except his family and me when I was teaching him how to paint. 

They started teasing him in school calling him Lying Wyatt. One of her neighbors parents and children used to yell out insults to him. The father of the victim is very much a pacifist but he walked over to the father that day and punched him. 

A short lasting feud started happening between the two families after the punch. Then suddenly"" Me W smirked started having all kinds of electrical issues at their house. They could not prove that the Staples was doing it as for me I believe Mr Staples and his youngest son and being so proficient as electric engineers had nothing to do with the electrical issues."" Mr Warlow gave an evil smile. *They moved out.""

""I just want to make very clear that all of those that supported Wyatt were simply there to show him he was not alone and he was very loved. We were not there to heal him. He healed himself.""

""Do you happen to know the name of the psychiatrist that he had visits with?""

Mr. W ""to be honest there were so many that worked with Wyatt I could not keep track of all them.""

The professor ""thank you sir for your service and the interview.""

The professor turned off the camera and ended the interview. While they waited for the Staples to get home these share the coffee and with the next truck easel Mr Warlow pulled out they quietly painted and chatted 

When Mr Warlow asked him why they call him the professor when he is a commoner he explained ""that's because legally I am a professor.""  He told Mr Warlow about his story of wanting more knowledge and sneaking into the universities. He then told him about the court case and the judge making him take all the final exams and how he passed them. 

Mr Warlow started laughing saying there is no way he made you write the exams. 

The professor simply smiled and pulled out a transcripts of all his final grades and above that a copy of his diplomas.

Mr Warlow was first in shock then said ""I thought I was a rebel"" and started laughing so hard for the first time in years daddy cried.

The end

I’ve been a GM for about 5 years now and with coffee for about 10. I recently took over this location after a former manager was let go due to performance. A majority of her staff didn’t like her but some did. 

I feel defeated most days at work (though I try and keep it hidden) because a few team members are just too much. For instance, if we restock sandwiches and there are 8 DSB and one is a day off on accident, this shift supervisor loses her mind. It’s the small stuff that gets her and I’ve had several conversations with her regarding, is this an accident from an employee who is doing 38 things or is this an actual thing we need to focus on like noticing several instances where food is rotated completely wrong or product is made wrong. Are we helping our team? We’re in our roles to find these mistakes as they happen and fix them vs just point out every little thing. However, a majority of the team like her. She’s also made numerous rude comments about other employees calling them “lazy” and “everyone hates them” even though myself, the DM, nor the ASM see what she sees. It’s always picking things apart vs building them up. And I see others following her lead. 

I recently cut her hours from 35 hours a week to 16, to 8. She addressed it with me and I told say down with her and outlined everything. I started with all the positives but ultimately, we have to see improvement on what we discussed before I felt comfortable leaving her as the leader in change. She then told the staff I was forcing her to quit and she’d done nothing wrong and this was out of the blue. 

While I want to make positive change in the store. I don’t want a store full of employees who hate me. Though, I feel like it’ll just be 2-3/18. What is everyone’s thoughts? Do I let her come back from this or hold strong? How do I continue to build trust when stuff like this happens with a new team? ",1,1756686674.0,starbucksbaristas,5,1.0,False

1n5am7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/1n5am7u/funding_your_faith/,Funding your faith,"While my husband and I have a happy life, we frequently face financial pressures—large family, lots of grandkids, constant repairs at home—and we mainly travel when my husband has a work assignment I can join. We help our adult children when we can, but our budget is always tight. Realistically, we’re not going to be wealthy, and we’re okay with that.

I work part-time and spend several hours each week volunteering at the BigCity Harvest Hub—a made-up name—where my husband proudly introduces me as a ""shopper."" Volunteering is our way to contribute to the community as best we can, and if my health flares up, I let the Hub know (though I’m able to volunteer most of the time).

Recently, our clergy sent a notice about a church charity drive, explaining that past drives received little support and this might be the last one for a while. My husband and I decided to combine a modest Costco date with shopping for the drive. I appreciate and respect that churches rely on donations to support their missions, and I understand why ClergyMan has to encourage us to contribute. When I asked about getting a receipt for tax purposes, ClergyMan discouraged requesting receipts, suggesting gifts should come ""from the heart,"" though he did eventually share the contact for the new officer handling donations. Ever since, newsletters have emphasized ""first fruits"" giving, suggesting in a guilt-manner that many spend more on dates or coffee than on church, and even argue tax receipts shouldn't be the point—messages that feel aimed at those who need the deduction. He also often states in these letters that ""unlike Europe, our taxes do not support the church!"" I go to a church with small town folks-- most are not thinking about Europe!

For us, tax-deductible receipts sometimes make the difference between being able to give and having to pull back. They help us keep contributing, even if our gifts aren’t large, and I genuinely want the church to thrive. I think in this regard, our taxes DO help the church. (ETA to clarify: these comments from ClergyMan are not sitting well with me AND) I am starting to genuinely dislike the church, but I know this problem may be everywhere.

Is it common for churches to discourage people from requesting tax receipts or suggest guilt over it, even when those receipts enable people to keep contributing? Are we doing enough with modest contributions—like volunteering, participating in drives, and giving within our means? And why are people motivated to support their churches: is it faith, community, tradition, or something else?",1,1756686613.0,religion,0,1.0,False
1n5alfi,https://i.redd.it/1irxvbf07gmf1.jpeg,Seeing Her Again,"✈️ I’m Going to Finland! 🇫🇮❤️

This is such a huge step for me — I’m officially going to visit my partner in Finland, and I couldn’t be happier (or more nervous). 🥹✨ This will be my first time traveling overseas on my own, and it feels surreal to think that soon I’ll be walking through airports, figuring out my layovers, and then finally running into their arms after months of waiting.

Planning this trip hasn’t just been about flights and suitcases — it’s been about courage. About saying yes to adventure, even though it’s scary. About choosing love, even across oceans. About trusting that all the stress and the long hours in the airport will be worth it when I finally get that first hug. ❤️

I’m learning how to pack layers for Finland’s weather, budgeting for food and trains, and even preparing myself for my long layover — it’s a whole experience before the experience even begins. But I’m grateful for it, because it’s reminding me just how much this person means to me.

This trip is more than travel. It’s proof that distance doesn’t stop love — it just makes the reunion that much sweeter. 💌

Here’s to long flights, airport coffee, new adventures, and finally being in the same place again. 💕

*Turning frustration into functional relationships*

---

We've all encountered them – that person who transforms every minor setback into a major crisis, who sees conspiracies in coincidences, and who treats every loss as evidence of cosmic unfairness. Whether it's your colleague who blames the printer for their missed deadlines, your family member who insists the weather is personally targeting them, or your teammate who claims the referee has it out for them, dealing with perpetual complainers can drain your energy faster than a smartphone on 1% battery. 📱

But here's the thing: understanding how to navigate these relationships isn't just about maintaining your sanity – it's about creating healthier environments for everyone involved.

## The Psychology Behind Persistent Negativity 🧠

Before we dive into solutions, let's understand what drives this behavior. People who consistently blame external factors for their problems often operate from a place of self-protection. Their brain has learned that accepting responsibility feels threatening, so it automatically deflects blame outward like a shield.

This isn't necessarily about character flaws – it's often about learned patterns that once served a purpose but now create problems. Maybe they grew up in an environment where admitting mistakes felt dangerous, or perhaps they've experienced genuine injustices that taught them the world really can be unfair.

Understanding this doesn't mean accepting toxic behavior, but it helps us respond more effectively.

## The Golden Framework: CALM 🌟

Here's a practical approach that works whether you're dealing with a difficult family member, office colleague, or team participant:

**C - Contain the Emotional Spillover**
Don't let their emotional state become your emotional state. When someone starts spiraling into complaint mode, imagine yourself wearing an invisible raincoat that lets their negativity slide off. Take deep breaths and remind yourself that their reaction is about them, not about the situation or you.

**A - Acknowledge Without Agreeing**
You can validate their feelings without validating their interpretation of events. Try phrases like ""I can see you're really frustrated"" instead of ""You're absolutely right, that was unfair."" This shows empathy while maintaining boundaries.

**L - Limit the Feedback Loop**
Chronic complainers often feed off reactions. The more you argue with their perspective, the more they dig in. Instead of providing counter-evidence (which rarely works), simply listen for a reasonable amount of time, then redirect: ""I hear that you're upset. What would you like to do moving forward?""

**M - Model Different Thinking**
When appropriate, demonstrate alternative ways of viewing situations. Instead of lecturing about personal responsibility, show it through your own actions and responses.

## Specific Strategies for Different Settings 🎪

### In the Workplace 💼

**The Meeting Hijacker**: When someone consistently turns every team meeting into a complaint session about processes, tools, or colleagues, try the ""parking lot"" technique. Keep a visible list where concerns get written down to be ""addressed later,"" then guide the conversation back to the agenda.

**The Email Victim**: Some people send novels about why they couldn't complete tasks, filled with detailed explanations of every obstacle they encountered. Respond briefly and focus only on next steps: ""Thanks for the update. What support do you need to complete this by Thursday?""

**The Credit Thief's Opposite**: While some people steal credit, chronic complainers often deflect it entirely, even when they've done good work. Make a point of publicly recognizing their contributions when they do succeed – this can gradually rewire their internal narrative.

### At Home 🏠

**The Family Critic**: When a relative turns family gatherings into complaint sessions, use the ""gentle redirect"" approach. ""I hear you're frustrated with [situation]. Right now, let's focus on enjoying our time together. We can talk about solutions later if you'd like.""

**The Domestic Blame Game**: If household responsibilities become a source of constant grievance, create clear systems that remove ambiguity. Use shared calendars, rotation schedules, or simple checklists that make expectations transparent.

**The Social Media Warrior**: Some family members use social platforms to air grievances constantly. Don't engage with these posts – it only feeds the cycle. Instead, reach out privately if you're genuinely concerned about their wellbeing.

### In Social Groups 🎭

**The Team Sport Excuse Machine**: Whether it's recreational sports, hobby groups, or volunteer organizations, some people consistently blame external factors for poor outcomes. Focus conversations on improvement and learning rather than analyzing what went wrong.

**The Event Complainer**: At parties, gatherings, or community events, some people seem to find fault with everything. Use the ""appreciation sandwich"" – briefly acknowledge their concern, then highlight something positive about the event, then suggest they speak with organizers if they have constructive feedback.

## The Long-Term Relationship Strategy 📈

### Setting Boundaries Without Building Walls

The goal isn't to shut people out entirely, but to create sustainable interaction patterns. Think of it like setting up a garden – you need both nutrients and boundaries for healthy growth.

**Time Limits**: It's perfectly reasonable to limit how much time you spend listening to complaints. ""I have ten minutes to talk about this, then I need to focus on other things.""

**Topic Boundaries**: You can choose not to engage with certain subjects. ""I've noticed we always end up frustrated when we talk about [topic]. Let's save that energy for things we can actually influence.""

**Energy Protection**: Just as you wouldn't let someone constantly borrow money without expecting them to become more financially responsible, don't let people constantly borrow your emotional energy without encouraging them to develop their own coping skills.

### Encouraging Growth Without Preaching

Instead of directly challenging their worldview (which usually backfires), create opportunities for different experiences:

- Invite them to activities where they might experience success
- Ask questions that encourage self-reflection: ""What do you think worked well in that situation?""
- Share stories (without making it about them) of times when you've learned from setbacks
- Model the behavior you'd like to see without pointing it out explicitly

## The Ripple Effect: Creating Positive Environments 🌊

When you handle chronic complainers skillfully, you're not just managing one relationship – you're influencing the entire atmosphere of your workplace, family, or social group. Others notice how you stay calm, redirect conversations constructively, and maintain boundaries while remaining kind.

This creates permission for others to do the same, gradually shifting group dynamics toward more positive patterns. It's like being the person who starts picking up litter in a park – others often join in without being asked.

## Practical Daily Applications 🗓️

### Morning Mindset Preparation

Before entering environments where you'll encounter chronic complainers, take two minutes to mentally prepare. Remind yourself of your goals for the day and visualize yourself staying calm and focused regardless of others' energy.

### The 24-Hour Rule

When someone dumps a major complaint on you, resist the urge to immediately solve, argue, or absorb their emotion. Say something like ""That sounds really challenging. Let me think about this and get back to you tomorrow."" Often, both of you will have better perspective after some time passes.

### Energy Check-Ins

Throughout your day, pause and notice your energy levels. If you feel drained after interactions with certain people, that's valuable information. You might need to adjust your approach, limit contact time, or increase your self-care practices.

### The Success Journal

Keep track of small wins in these relationships. Maybe the chronic complainer actually thanked you for something, or perhaps they caught themselves mid-complaint and changed the subject. Noticing progress helps you stay motivated and recognizes that people can change, even gradually.

## When Professional Help Makes Sense 🤝

Sometimes chronic complaining is a symptom of deeper issues – depression, anxiety, past trauma, or other mental health challenges. While you're not responsible for fixing these problems, you can suggest resources when appropriate.

If someone's complaints consistently center on feeling hopeless, worthless, or trapped, they might benefit from talking to a counselor. You can mention this without diagnosing: ""It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress. Have you ever considered talking to someone professionally about strategies for managing all this?""

## The Bigger Picture: Building Resilient Communities 🌍

Every time we respond to chronic complainers with patience instead of irritation, boundaries instead of enabling, and hope instead of cynicism, we're contributing to more resilient communities. We're modeling that it's possible to acknowledge problems without being consumed by them, and that personal agency exists even in difficult circumstances.

This approach works across cultures, generations, and belief systems because it's based on universal human needs: the need to be heard, the need for respect, and the need for hope that things can improve.

## Your Action Plan for Tomorrow 📋

Starting tomorrow, pick one relationship where chronic complaining creates friction. Choose just one strategy from this guide to practice consistently for a week. Maybe it's using the CALM framework with your colleague, or setting a time limit on complaint conversations with your family member.

Notice what happens – not just with them, but with your own energy and stress levels. Pay attention to how other people respond to your new approach. Often, the changes ripple out in unexpected ways.

Remember: You can't control whether someone else chooses to stay stuck in complaint patterns, but you can control how you respond. And sometimes, your consistent, calm response becomes the mirror that helps them see their own patterns more clearly.

The goal isn't to eliminate all complaining – sometimes people need to vent, and sometimes complaints contain valuable information about real problems. The goal is to prevent chronic complaining from hijacking relationships and environments, while creating space for more constructive interactions.

Every interaction is an opportunity to practice these skills. Every time you choose patience over frustration, boundaries over enabling, and hope over cynicism, you're not just managing a difficult person – you're becoming a more skilled human being yourself.

*Change starts with one person choosing to respond differently. Today, that person can be you.* ✨

As we saw just in the past week, Rec Room fired almost 50% of their staff. It’s widely known that most of the Rec Room glazer’s biggest dream is to earn that “dev” or “support” title in their name, and glaze a lot more proudly under it — this time getting paid $1.25 an hour to do so.

But… that prospect may now, forever, just be a mere dream to them, as Rec Room heartlessly fired almost half of their employees - including one of the guys almost crucial to Rec Room’s whole art style.

An interesting trajectory the game seems to be on. Once flaunting their billion dollar value, to begging for the measly price of a coffee, to now firing its staff left and right. 

Now more than ever, we need the glazing army.

The question remains: will the glazers stand strong? All signs point to yes. No doubt, we’ll soon enough have people saying that these firings were “for the greater good,” or maybe it will be mysteries investors who are to blame, as they seem to be behind every bad decision.

1n5aefk,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n5aefk/dealing_with_that_one_difficult_person_a/,Dealing with That One Difficult Person: A Universal Guide to Managing Bias and Conflict,"

*Every group has one. That person who seems to see everything through a distorted lens, who brings their personal agenda to every discussion, and who makes simple decisions feel like navigating a minefield. Whether it's in your family, workplace, or social circle, learning to work with biased individuals isn't just a skill—it's a survival strategy for modern life.*

## The Reality Check: We All Have Our Blind Spots 🤔

Before diving into strategies, let's acknowledge an uncomfortable truth: bias isn't exclusive to ""difficult people."" We all carry unconscious preferences, assumptions, and emotional baggage that color our judgment. The difference lies in self-awareness and the willingness to question our own perspectives.

The person you're struggling with might not even realize their bias exists. They could genuinely believe they're being objective while their past experiences, cultural background, or personal insecurities drive their behavior. Understanding this doesn't excuse problematic actions, but it does help us approach the situation with more effective strategies.

## The Three Types of Biased Behavior You'll Encounter 📊

**The Controller** tends to dominate conversations, dismiss others' ideas, and insist their way is the only correct path. They often interrupt, talk over people, and become defensive when challenged.

**The Victim** frames every situation as something happening *to* them rather than something they participate in. They resist accountability and often use emotional manipulation to avoid responsibility.

**The Judge** constantly evaluates others based on narrow criteria, making snap decisions about people's worth, intelligence, or character. They're quick to label and slow to reconsider.

Most difficult people exhibit combinations of these patterns, shifting between them based on the situation and their stress levels.

## The Foundation: Your Mental Preparation 🧠

Success in dealing with biased individuals starts with your own mindset. Think of yourself as a skilled negotiator entering a challenging discussion rather than a victim walking into an ambush.

**Set Clear Boundaries Before Engagement**
Decide in advance what behaviors you will and won't tolerate. Will you allow interrupting? Personal attacks? Circular arguments that go nowhere? Having these boundaries clear in your mind helps you respond consistently rather than reactively.

**Separate the Person from the Pattern**
Focus on addressing specific behaviors rather than attacking character. Instead of thinking ""Sarah is impossible,"" reframe it as ""Sarah tends to interrupt when she feels unheard."" This subtle shift opens up more productive response options.

**Accept What You Cannot Change**
You cannot force someone to become self-aware, reasonable, or fair. You can only control your own responses and set up situations for better outcomes. This acceptance actually increases your power because you stop wasting energy on impossible goals.

## The Engagement Strategy: Practical Techniques That Work ⚡

**The Validation Bridge**
Start by acknowledging something valid in their perspective before introducing your own. ""I can see why you'd be concerned about the timeline"" followed by ""and I think we can address that while also considering the quality concerns others have raised."" This approach reduces defensiveness and creates space for dialogue.

**The Question Technique**
Instead of making statements that can be argued with, ask questions that encourage self-reflection. ""What would need to happen for you to feel comfortable with this approach?"" or ""Help me understand what's driving your concern here."" Questions can reveal underlying issues while making the person feel heard.

**The Documentation Method**
For ongoing situations, especially in professional settings, keep records of agreements, decisions, and patterns of behavior. Don't do this secretly—be transparent. ""Let me send around notes from our discussion so we're all clear on what we decided."" This creates accountability and reduces the chance of revisionist history.

## Workplace Applications: From Meetings to Daily Interactions 💼

**Managing Biased Team Members in Meetings**
Structure discussions to minimize bias impact. Use round-robin sharing where everyone gets equal time. Introduce topics with background information before opening discussion. Set ground rules about respectful communication and stick to them.

When someone dominates conversation, use phrases like ""Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"" or ""I'd like to get a few different perspectives before we move forward."" Stay calm and matter-of-fact.

**Handling Biased Supervisors or Authority Figures**
Document everything and communicate primarily in writing when possible. Follow up verbal conversations with emails summarizing what was discussed. Present options rather than problems—""I see three ways we could handle this situation"" rather than ""This won't work.""

Build relationships with other team members and stakeholders so you're not dependent on one person's interpretation of your performance or ideas.

**Dealing with Biased Colleagues on Projects**
Focus on shared goals and measurable outcomes. ""We both want this project to succeed, so let's figure out how to get there"" keeps the conversation productive. Break large disagreements into smaller, specific issues that can be addressed one at a time.

Use neutral language and avoid emotional triggers. Instead of ""That's wrong,"" try ""I see it differently"" or ""My experience has been...""

## Family Dynamics: Navigating Personal Relationships 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Family situations require special care because these relationships are typically long-term and emotionally charged. The stakes feel higher, and old patterns run deeper.

**Holiday and Gathering Management**
Prepare conversation redirects in advance. When Uncle Bob starts his usual complaints, have neutral topics ready: ""Speaking of changes, did you see the new community center they're building?"" Practice these transitions until they feel natural.

Set time limits on difficult conversations. ""I can talk about this for a few more minutes, then I need to help with dinner."" Having an exit strategy reduces anxiety and helps you stay calmer during the interaction.

**Dealing with Biased Family Members in Decision-Making**
For important family decisions—care for aging parents, holiday planning, financial matters—propose structured approaches. ""Let's each take a day to think about this and come back with our top three concerns and our preferred solution."" This slows down reactive decision-making and encourages more thoughtful responses.

When possible, involve neutral third parties like family counselors or mediators for major decisions. Professional facilitators can manage bias more effectively than family members can.

**Managing Your Own Emotional Responses**
Family bias often triggers our deepest insecurities and oldest wounds. Recognize your emotional patterns and have strategies ready. Take breaks, practice deep breathing, remind yourself that their behavior reflects their issues, not your worth.

## Building Long-Term Solutions: Creating Better Systems 🔧

**Environmental Design**
Change the conditions that enable biased behavior rather than fighting the behavior directly. If someone dominates meetings, introduce structured formats. If family gatherings always become arguments, plan activities that discourage confrontation—cooking together, games, shared projects.

**Gradual Boundary Setting**
Don't try to change everything at once. Pick one or two behaviors to address consistently, then gradually expand your expectations. ""I'm going to start ending conversations when they become personal attacks"" is more manageable than trying to revolutionize every interaction.

**Building Alternative Relationships**
Reduce your dependence on difficult people by strengthening relationships with more reasonable individuals. At work, cultivate relationships across departments. In families, connect more with the relatives who communicate well. Having options reduces the power any one biased person has over your experience.

## Communication Techniques That Transcend Culture and Context 🗣️

**The Broken Record Technique**
When someone keeps arguing with your position, calmly repeat your main point using slightly different words. ""As I mentioned, my availability is limited to Tuesday and Thursday"" becomes ""Tuesday and Thursday are the only days that work for me"" becomes ""I can only meet on Tuesday or Thursday."" Consistency without escalation often breaks through resistance.

**The Time-Out Strategy**
When conversations become circular or heated, suggest a pause. ""This is important enough that we should take time to think it through. Let's revisit this tomorrow."" This prevents bad decisions made in emotional moments and gives everyone space to reconsider their positions.

**The Collaborative Reframe**
Transform adversarial discussions into problem-solving sessions. ""It sounds like we both want to find a solution that works for everyone. What if we brainstorm some options together?"" This changes the dynamic from you-versus-me to us-versus-the-problem.

## The Daily Practice: Making These Skills Automatic 💪

**Morning Mental Preparation**
Before entering potentially challenging situations, spend two minutes visualizing positive outcomes. See yourself remaining calm, speaking clearly, and maintaining your boundaries. This mental rehearsal improves your actual performance.

**Evening Reflection**
Review difficult interactions without judgment. What worked well? What would you do differently? This reflection builds your skills over time and helps you identify patterns in both your behavior and others'.

**Stress Management as Prevention**
Your ability to handle biased people correlates directly with your overall stress levels. Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and healthy boundaries in all your relationships create the emotional reserves you need for challenging interactions.

## Advanced Strategies: When Standard Approaches Need Upgrading 🚀

**The Strategic Ally Approach**
Identify people who have influence with the biased individual and share your concerns with them. Don't gossip or complain—present the situation as a problem that affects team or family effectiveness. ""I'm concerned that our meetings aren't as productive as they could be. Have you noticed anything?""

**The Consequences Method**
When someone's bias consistently creates problems, implement natural consequences rather than trying to change their mind. If they're always late, start without them. If they interrupt, pause and say ""I wasn't finished"" then continue. Let their choices create their own outcomes.

**The Expertise Leverage**
Use external authorities to support your positions. ""The research shows..."" or ""Industry best practice suggests..."" makes disagreement less personal. The biased person can argue with you, but they're less likely to argue with established expertise.

## Maintaining Your Own Mental Health Through the Process 🌱

**Recognize Success Differently**
Success might not mean the other person changes. Success might mean you stay calm, maintain your boundaries, or prevent a situation from escalating. Celebrate these victories—they're significant achievements.

**Build Your Support Network**
Talk with trusted friends or family members about your experiences. Having people who understand the situation and validate your perspective helps prevent you from questioning your own judgment.

**Know When to Walk Away**
Some relationships are too toxic to maintain, even with excellent strategies. Family members who are consistently abusive, colleagues who actively undermine your work, friends who drain your energy without reciprocating—sometimes the healthiest choice is disengagement.

## The Ripple Effect: How Your Changes Impact Others 🌊

When you consistently respond to bias with calm professionalism rather than reactive emotion, you model better behavior for everyone around you. Other team members see that productive dialogue is possible. Family members notice that gatherings can be pleasant when someone manages the dynamics well.

Your improved skills don't just help you deal with one difficult person—they elevate the entire group dynamic. People feel safer expressing different opinions when they see someone effectively managing conflict without escalating it.

## Future-Proofing Your Approach 🔮

These strategies work across cultures, generations, and changing social contexts because they address fundamental human psychology rather than specific cultural norms. The need to feel heard, respected, and valued transcends time periods and social structures.

As society evolves, the specific manifestations of bias may change, but the underlying patterns remain consistent. Someone who learns to ask good questions, set clear boundaries, and remain emotionally regulated will be effective whether they're dealing with a difficult neighbor in 2024 or managing conflict in whatever social structures exist centuries from now.

The principles translate because they're based on how humans process information, make decisions, and respond to social pressure—processes that are likely to remain consistent as long as humans remain fundamentally human.

## Your Action Plan: Starting Tomorrow 📋

Choose one specific relationship where you want to apply these concepts. Don't try to revolutionize everything at once. Pick your most manageable challenge first—success builds confidence for harder situations.

Identify which type of biased behavior you're dealing with most often and select two or three techniques that feel natural for your personality. Practice these in low-stakes situations before deploying them in high-stress moments.

Remember that change is gradual. You're developing new habits while helping others develop theirs. Be patient with the process while staying consistent with your approach.

The investment you make in these skills pays dividends across every area of your life. Better conflict resolution makes you more effective at work, happier at home, and more confident in social situations. These aren't just techniques for managing difficult people—they're life skills that make everything easier.

Most importantly, remember that you have more power in these situations than you might realize. You cannot control other people's behavior, but you can absolutely control how you respond to it. That response determines whether difficult interactions drain your energy or become opportunities to practice skills that serve you for life.

One thing I think of periodically is how nice it would be if we had a bit more of a European park cafe culture here. I'm not talking about dropping a giant restaurant in the middle of Hippie Hill. I'm talking about stuff like [this in Amsterdam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HMKRUs19EZ4Xu2Je9), or [this in Berlin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/v9ULxsxAMzRNtuS6A), or [this in Munich](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vivRGSLWHdnC7TRU7), or hell even something tiny like [this kiosk that sold beer and coffee that I went to in Lisbon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yzndi2AS4BNqG4xC6) \- honestly thinking more that size than the larger biergartens in Germany, although the vibe of picnic tables/slow living is what I'm talking about. New York has some of this, like the cafe seating in Bryant Park or the OG Shake Shack in Madison Square Park (which admittedly is now quite corporate and not what I'm actually advocating for, but originally was cool). I feel like the Panhandle or Dolores would be a perfect place for something like this. Not anything that would block the biking or jogging crowd, or take up much space from the parkgoers, but just something charming where you could sit and have a nice beer or a coffee and pastry under the trees in the afternoon while you're walking through.

I get that we have a few spots where you can eat outdoors - Tunnel Tops has something akin to this now, Alamo Square has that coffee bus, and we also have plenty of outdoor dining and stuff like Biergarten in Hayes or any of the parklets. But I think having a nice permanent cafe in the middle of the green space of a park is really something that could elevate the city here.

Ever encountered someone who insists on doing everything alone? That colleague who politely declines help, works behind closed doors, and seems allergic to collaboration? You're dealing with what we call the ""Overly Independent"" personality type. 🎯

These individuals aren't being difficult on purpose. They're often highly capable people who've learned to rely on themselves above all else. But in our interconnected world, their go-it-alone approach can create friction in families, workplaces, and communities.

## Understanding the Independent Mindset 🧠

Before we can effectively work with overly independent people, we need to understand what drives them. These individuals typically share certain characteristics:

They value self-reliance above almost everything else. Past experiences may have taught them that depending on others leads to disappointment. They often fear losing control when they delegate or collaborate. Many have perfectionist tendencies and believe they can do things better themselves.

This mindset isn't inherently wrong. These people often accomplish remarkable things through sheer determination and self-sufficiency. However, problems arise when their independence becomes a barrier to team success or relationship harmony.

## The Real Impact on Teams and Families 📊

When someone refuses to collaborate, the effects ripple outward. Team projects stall because information isn't shared. Family decisions get made in isolation, leaving others feeling excluded. Innovation suffers because diverse perspectives never merge.

Other team members may feel undervalued or unnecessary. Projects often take longer because one person shoulders the entire burden. Knowledge hoarding creates dangerous single points of failure. Relationships strain under the weight of perceived rejection.

## The Strategic Approach: Building Bridges, Not Walls 🌉

Successfully engaging with overly independent people requires patience, strategy, and genuine understanding. Here's your practical roadmap:

**Start Small and Build Trust**

Don't immediately push for major collaboration. Begin with tiny, low-risk opportunities for them to work with others. Perhaps ask them to review someone else's work or provide input on a minor decision. Success in small collaborations builds their confidence in working with others.

**Acknowledge Their Expertise**

These individuals often have deep knowledge and skills. Publicly recognize their contributions and expertise. When they feel valued for what they bring to the table, they're more likely to engage with others who also have something valuable to offer.

**Create Safe Collaboration Spaces**

Establish environments where they feel comfortable sharing ideas without fear of judgment or losing control. This might mean smaller group discussions, written feedback rather than verbal brainstorming, or clearly defined roles where they maintain ownership of their expertise.

## Practical Daily Strategies 💡

**In the Workplace**

Schedule regular one-on-one check-ins where they can share progress without feeling micromanaged. Use project management tools that allow for individual ownership while maintaining team visibility. Assign them mentor roles where they can share knowledge while maintaining their expert status.

Create opportunities for them to lead initiatives that require some collaboration but don't threaten their sense of control. Celebrate their individual achievements while highlighting how their work contributes to team success.

**In Family Settings**

Include them in family decisions by asking for their expert opinion on relevant topics. Give them specific responsibilities that are clearly their domain while connecting these to family goals. Share appreciation for their contributions to family welfare and security.

Avoid forcing group activities, but create optional opportunities where their skills or interests might naturally draw them in. Respect their need for independent time while maintaining open communication about family needs and concerns.

**In Any Team Environment**

Communicate the ""why"" behind collaborative requests. Help them see how working together serves their own goals and values. Provide multiple ways to contribute so they can choose methods that feel comfortable to them.

Be patient with their process of warming up to collaboration. Celebrate small steps toward teamwork rather than demanding immediate transformation. Focus on outcomes and results rather than forcing changes in their working style.

## The Long-Term Transformation Process 🚀

Change takes time, especially for people whose independence has served them well in the past. Your role isn't to break down their self-reliance but to help them see collaboration as another tool for achieving excellence.

Start by demonstrating reliability in small things. Show up when you say you will. Follow through on commitments. Prove that working with others can actually enhance rather than diminish their effectiveness.

Gradually introduce them to the benefits of diverse perspectives. Share examples of how collaboration has led to better solutions in situations similar to theirs. Help them experience firsthand how other people's input can improve their already good work.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls ⚠️

Don't take their independence personally. Their behavior isn't about rejecting you specifically; it's about maintaining control and avoiding perceived risks. Pushing too hard or too fast often triggers their defenses and makes them retreat further into isolation.

Avoid making collaboration mandatory unless absolutely necessary. Instead, make it attractive by showing clear benefits and removing barriers that make teamwork feel risky or inefficient to them.

Don't try to change their personality. Instead, work with their natural tendencies while creating opportunities for controlled collaboration that aligns with their goals and values.

## When Independence Becomes Problematic 🚨

Sometimes, overly independent behavior crosses the line from personal preference to team disruption. If someone's refusal to collaborate is seriously impacting project outcomes or team morale, more direct intervention may be necessary.

Have honest conversations about the specific impacts of their behavior. Focus on observable consequences rather than personality judgments. Provide clear expectations about minimum collaboration requirements while still respecting their preferred working style.

Consider whether their role or responsibilities might be better aligned with their independent nature. Sometimes the problem isn't the person but the mismatch between their strengths and their required interactions.

## Building Your Own Collaboration Skills 🛠️

Working effectively with independent people also requires developing your own skills. Learn to communicate clearly and concisely. Respect their time by being prepared and focused in interactions. Demonstrate competence in your own areas so they see you as a worthy collaborator.

Practice patience and persistence. Building trust with highly independent people takes time, but the results are often worth the investment. These individuals frequently become some of the most loyal and effective team members once they feel secure in collaborative relationships.

## Creating Sustainable Systems 🔄

The goal isn't to create dependent people but to help overly independent individuals become selectively collaborative. They should retain their self-reliance while developing the ability to work effectively with others when it serves their goals.

Establish systems that honor both independence and collaboration. This might include flexible working arrangements, clear role definitions, or communication protocols that provide autonomy while maintaining team connection.

Regular feedback and adjustment ensure that collaborative approaches continue working for everyone involved. What works today may need refinement as people grow and circumstances change.

## The Universal Application 🌍

These strategies work across cultures, generations, and contexts because they're based on fundamental human needs for respect, autonomy, and purpose. Whether you're dealing with a stubborn teenager, a senior executive, or a volunteer coordinator, the principles remain the same.

Adaptation to specific situations is key. A family setting requires different approaches than a corporate environment, but the underlying respect for independence while encouraging selective collaboration remains constant.

## Moving Forward Together 🤝

Remember that overly independent people often have valuable perspectives and skills precisely because of their self-reliant approach. Your goal isn't to eliminate their independence but to help them use it more effectively within collaborative frameworks.

Success comes from patient, consistent application of these principles. Small improvements in collaboration compound over time, eventually creating significant positive changes in team dynamics and relationships.

The investment in learning to work with independent personalities pays dividends far beyond individual relationships. You'll develop skills in patience, strategic thinking, and inclusive leadership that benefit every aspect of your personal and professional life.

These approaches create environments where all personality types can contribute their best work while supporting common goals. The result is stronger teams, healthier relationships, and better outcomes for everyone involved.

I live in a medium sized city in the States, and not in the best of neighborhoods.  At every major intersection (which are Many), someone homeless is begging for money, often on all 4 sides.  

Now, I live on a meager fixed income, my car is 15 years old, and there’s no such thing as “extra money”.  My roommate lets me pay rent in cooking, cleaning and groceries.  I would certainly help others if I could, but I just can’t.  That’s where the anxiety comes in.  

I can’t make a left turn without being stopped at a red light where someone is panhandling.  I will go straight and flip a bitch to avoid them.  Even still, this sends my anxiety through the roof.  I’m ashamed that my circumstances are slightly better than theirs, but I still can’t help.  Then I get angry because I feel like I have to pay a toll at every red light to get through, and I lament once again that I can’t really help them.  

And then there’s the times when “no good deed goes unpunished”.  One example:

I stopped at a gas station before work one morning to get a danish and a coffee.  There was this tweaker girl outside who asked me for cash for cigarettes. (I know a tweaker when I see one, I wasn’t stereotyping).  I apologized and said I didn’t have any cash, and I really didn’t.  But inside, I bought her a discount pack of cigarettes and offered them to her.  She said: “that’s not my brand, but maybe the store will swap with me”.  I just looked at her for a moment, then drove myself on into work.  All I could think of was:  wow at the audacity.  

Every time I leave my house, I’m reminded why I never leave my house.  It’s not just panhandlers, driving in general, people in general.  I’m practically a full blown agoraphobe as it is.  Only guilt or necessity drags me out, which I guess is my own self imposed “therapy”.  I still (mostly figuratively) kick and scream like a toddler when I have to go out for any reason.

Now I’m a month clean of vaping, and have cut down on caffeine.

I’ve been under so much stress, which is why I think it’s anxiety related but I stress myself out so much over this. Today I was driving and my hands felt so tingly and I felt it in my face. I pulled over and took deep breaths, it went away and I started driving again. I was 5 minutes from home so I just kept going. I got home, took a medication for panic attacks I’ve been prescribed before and it did help. 

I have been feeling chest discomfort since not vaping and if I feel any anxiety I take my medication and it does help.

This is such a huge step for me — I’m officially going to visit my partner in Finland, and I couldn’t be happier (or more nervous). 🥹✨ This will be my first time traveling overseas on my own, and it feels surreal to think that soon I’ll be walking through airports, figuring out my layovers, and then finally running into their arms after months of waiting.

Planning this trip hasn’t just been about flights and suitcases — it’s been about courage. About saying yes to adventure, even though it’s scary. About choosing love, even across oceans. About trusting that all the stress and the long hours in the airport will be worth it when I finally get that first hug. ❤️

I’m learning how to pack layers for Finland’s weather, budgeting for food and trains, and even preparing myself for my long layover — it’s a whole experience before the experience even begins. But I’m grateful for it, because it’s reminding me just how much this person means to me.

This trip is more than travel. It’s proof that distance doesn’t stop love — it just makes the reunion that much sweeter. 💌

Here’s to long flights, airport coffee, new adventures, and finally being in the same place again. 💕

First 8-9 years were wonderful just like I always dreamed, we travel, we change cities and make our home togheter, in sixth year (6years ago) of our marriage we have a son and I was thinking something will changeafter birth (depreson or something like that) but I doesn't untiiil 4 years ago. We don't have fights or problems with finance or with our child but something snapped in her. She stop cuddle with me, watch movies, participating in our long time hobbies and she became easily frustrated. Our love life became a joke.. 

At the start as many of you can think I was sure it was other man. I was so sure about my theory that I started to look at house cctv and talking to her friends. Nope she doesn't leave house, she is crocheting, watching TV with our kid, invite friends for coffee and so on. Even she leave her phone right next to me and go to sleep. Not even a sign for cheating. 

At second year I transfer all my thoughts on the live we live so I make it a little more interesting, travel to Milano , travel to Greece , vip tickets 1st roll to her favourite band Bad Omens and many many more. The only thing that change was moment happiness and after 1 week everything go back as before.

3 year I look at myself, I was a little overwheight so that must be it, right? From 106kg I dropped to 89 and yeah I got pretty descent body for my age and yeah nothing changed except my belly..

So now I'm at breaking point about 2 months ago we have a huge fight after I calmly said all those things and asked just for answers I can not take it anymore, I'm cuddly guy, emotional and I love intimacy, I can't live with just my wife as a roommate . Her answer was not really an answer she just scream and take things I said as a insult and after 5 hour of talking we decide to live seperetly (she propose that) and I calmly and without any option accepted it. In those 5 hours she was looking for place to move with our son, and I was thinking this is it it's over. And even I go to my friend real estate agent to find something nice (I want the best for them) so I find 2 3 options and send it to her and she tell me she going to visit them to see. And so a just waited, every night I come back from work and I'm in nervous state am I gonna be alone or my family is still at our home. A week pass by, nothing we don't talk she doesn't move , I ask my friend does she go to the apartments to chose he told me she doesn't even call him. Second week pass same thing , no talking in house between us and no change in moving. This month as a bonus I have 5 days vacation at the sea and told her can I go with our son, she insisted to go togheter so we make that. Now we talk but I'm afraid to bring those questions again.

1n5a6zm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5a6zm,Stinky dragon fan food V3 (season 1 side characters),"Hi , its been a bit since I did this , I moved since my last post here, I cant draw but I like working on recipes based on what fictional characters might like / do eat in the show (8 billion upvotes and ill do Hugh Männer lol) ive done the protagonists of season one and 2. With some spare time now that im moved in , here are some recipes for some NPC's from season 1 for you all to try:

Paralyte Breakfast: im not sure why but I see her as vegetarian, sorta fits the vibe. We have 2 English muffins smeared with a Syrian spread called Muhammara, which is a brilliant slightly spicy red pepper and walnut mixture that is amazing  (recipe here: https://share.google/PyVGaRt8UsCUFIqbB) a very light sprinkle of parmesan, and runny sunny side up eggs , topped with smoked sea salt and aleppo pepper.  

I chose this because when you are coming up with plots to ensure everyone is safe using the evergaurds , a light but filling breakfast paired with some coffee is ideal. My fan theory is that she does not eat meat often, so would want a protein from the walnuts in her breakfast. This was amazing and has become a breakfast for me about twice a week, I add a few extra spices to the muhammara, because the burn makes me feel good. 

Next is a law student , quizmaster , tour guide , and carriage driver , Euph Oric. He chews a lot of gum , and i thought the one thing about all of the jobs he has , plus his studies of law require a small sweet snack, because if he just eats mint gum it would get boring, and also make all cold water he drinks deal frost damage. So I made peach cobler puff pastry sprinkled with a hint of cinnamon sugar to warm him up, or be useful on a long ride.



Next is THE GREAT AND POWERFUL BRINK TUSSLER! For him I wanted to play with 2 things , the blue hair , and his big personality. Here is my best intro impersonation 

""It's a bedazzling base of blue raspberry syrup broods beneath a brash brume of bubbly Red Bull, then is lustrated with a lambent layer of lemonade. This scintillant stack of sweetness and sour sparkle is as delectable as it is diaphanous"" (a layer of a homemade blue raspberry and thyme syrup, a layer of red bull and topped with some elderflower lemonade) 

This drink pumped me up , and I definitely shouldn't mix it with vodka... but I will. 

Lastly is out Mayor Prattle ... or is it Gaurd Grattle? Cake.  much like the mayor it knows more than it lets on. This is a spiced honey cake with a ton of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg , and cloves. With a suprising filling of apple caramel spiked with bourbon with a cinnamon cream cheese frosting. 

I like this for him because it feels like something that would be in his office for visitors , and prospective investors in the town. I am amazingly bad a cake decorating,   I worked in steak houses , so im going to say my shoddy frosting job was because ... it represents him having to put up with the infinights? 

Overall this little project of recipes for characters is pretty fun! I know i want to do some antagonists (not Hugh) dishes, then  season 2 side characters( spaghetti all'assassina with a Wisconsin flair for carol)  , then hopefully ill know more about our season 3 squad to put together something (I am working to recreate Tolv's fish fry)

However, at its core, budgeting is not about restriction; it's about empowerment. It’s a tool that helps you understand where your money is going and allows you to make informed decisions about your financial future.

Whether you're looking to save for a big purchase, pay off debt, or simply reduce financial anxiety, a budget is your roadmap to achieving those goals.

# The Simple Principle: Income vs. Expenses

A budget is essentially a plan for your money. It's a way of comparing what you earn (**income**) to what you spend (**expenses**). The goal is to make sure your income is greater than or equal to your expenses, with the ideal situation being that you have money left over to save or invest.



# Step-by-Step: How to Create a Simple Budget



Creating a budget doesn’t have to be complicated. You can use a simple spreadsheet, a notebook, or a dedicated app. Just follow these steps:

Step 1: Know Your Income

This is the easiest part. List all sources of income you receive in a typical month. This could be your main salary, freelance work, side jobs, or any other regular payments. If your income varies, use an average from the last few months.

Step 2: Track Your Expenses

This is the most critical and often the most revealing step. For one month, track every single dollar you spend. This includes everything: rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, dining out, subscriptions, and even that morning coffee. You can do this by:

* Reviewing bank statements and credit card bills.
* Keeping all your receipts.
* Using a personal finance app that syncs with your bank accounts.

Step 3: Categorize and Analyze Your Spending

After a month of tracking, group your expenses into categories. You'll likely notice two types of spending:

* **Fixed Expenses:** These are predictable costs that are the same every month, like rent/mortgage, car payments, insurance, and student loans.
* **Variable Expenses:** These costs change from month to month, such as groceries, dining out, entertainment, and shopping.

This analysis will show you exactly where your money is going and where you might be able to make changes.

Step 4: Create a Budget Plan

Now that you have the numbers, it’s time to build your budget. The goal is to allocate your income to different categories of spending. A popular and easy-to-use method is the 50/30/20 Rule.

* **50% of your income** goes to **Needs**: Housing, utilities, transportation, and groceries. These are essential for living.
* **30% of your income** goes to **Wants**: Dining out, shopping, hobbies, and entertainment. These are non-essential but improve your quality of life.
* **20% of your income** goes to **Savings and Debt Repayment**: This is the money you set aside for an emergency fund, retirement, and paying down credit card or student loan debt.

You can customize these percentages to fit your unique situation, but the 50/30/20 rule is a great starting point.

Step 5: Review and Adjust

A budget isn't a ""set it and forget it"" tool. Life changes, and your budget should too. At the end of each month, review your spending against your plan. Did you go over in a certain category? Did you save more than you expected? Make adjustments for the next month based on what you learn.

# Conclusion: The Freedom of Financial Awareness

Budgeting isn't about giving up things you love. It’s about being intentional with your money so you can afford the things you truly value. By taking the time to understand your financial habits, you are no longer a passenger on your financial journey—you become the driver. This sense of control reduces stress and gives you the confidence to build a more secure future for yourself and your family.",1,1756685286.0,u_iwaachghadir,0,1.0,False

I live in NYC in a 1br apartment coop and I want to start roasting in here. I'm looking for something small that can vent any mess out the window through some kind of tubing or whatever. I'd love to get the setup to do this pretty well for around $500, but don't know what equipment I should use given these use cases. High quality, but not high volume, at least I don't think.

It doesn't need to be portable but will need to move it around sometimes when I'm setting up for social events.

To give a sense of volume, I drink one cup at home a day in the morning via espresso, and I'd like to take stuff to work whole bean that's good for an early afternoon pick-me-up. It'd also be nice to have some extra to give to friends right after I roast.

At the time the ideas felt inspiring but also too abstract. ""Habits shape identity"" and ""small changes compound"" sounded powerful, but as a freshman I had no process, no routine, and honestly no idea what I wanted to do. I understood the theory but I could not apply it.

This summer, now as a junior doing an internship, I came back to Atomic Habits in a different format. It was a 20 to 30 minute short audio version that condensed the key ideas and explained them from a student’s perspective. That framing completely changed how I saw the book.

Here are four things that really stuck with me and how I actually put them into practice:

**Identity-based habits finally made sense** I used to write stuff like ""be productive"" in my planner and of course it never stuck. In this version I learned to think in identities instead. So I started telling myself ""I’m the type of student who’s prepared."" Packing my bag at night or cleaning my desk after work feels small, but it actually makes me believe it.

**Small wins beat motivation** Before I’d wait until the panic hit to start studying. Now I just do something tiny, like highlight a sentence or open the doc. Once I begin it’s way easier to keep going. That’s what keeps me consistent now.

**Rituals made focus easier** Willpower never worked for me, so I asked the host in the app how to build rituals. He said keep them simple and repeatable. Now I always sit in the same library spot, headphones on, phone off. At my internship it is a quick coffee and one task before email.

**Collecting evidence matters** Every little thing adds up. Finishing notes before I leave class, asking a question in a meeting, those are all proof I’m the kind of person I want to be. The more evidence I have, the less I even think of it as effort.

I genuinely enjoyed it. Btw I listened to it on an app called [Nooka](https://nooka.ai), and they actually give students **free membership**, which made it even easier to try without overthinking.",0,1756684926.0,ProductivityApps,0,0.5,False

I’m a 22 year old female who just recently quit vaping and has cut down on caffeine. Everyday I drank coffee in the morning and a redbull every other day, sometimes also every day. Now I’m a month clean of vaping, and have cut down on caffeine. 

I’ve been having a lot of anxiety during withdrawal, and take Atarax which was prescribed to me before for panic attacks. I do feel chest discomfort and get a sudden wave of panic, and it does go away. 

I’ve been under so much stress, starting a full time job of teaching while still working at a side job on weekends, money problems, and today it was something because of my cat. I feel chest discomfort, anxiety, and today when driving home after going to get my cat something from Petsmart, my hands were tingly and I felt it in my face. My dumb mistake, I did drink an iced coffee that morning and that was all I had, no food. I got home, took an Atarax, ate a sandwich, and took a nap and felt better.

Since I stopped vaping I have felt chest discomfort and felt “weird” but the tingly feeling was the weirdest feeling I’ve felt and I was scared. I started feeling some discomfort in my left arm, but it also feels like how my arm feels when it’s sore. I was sleeping on it or on my right side and holding my phone with my left. I’ve never been so anxious about health problems before but recently I have been.

I’ve pushed back a doctor’s appointment thinking it’s pointless but I will for sure be calling once they are open. The arm pain/discomfort has gone away and so has the chest discomfort so that’s why I’m thinking it’s nothing, but no matter how much I try I can’t stop myself from panicking over thinking it’s serious. 

I had an EKG done June 25, 2025 and everything was fine. I had a physical done on August 15, 2025 and everything was fine. I am mostly scared because my grandmother passed away from a heart attack. I do believe they’re panic attacks and every time I have one I do end up waking up just fine, but I can’t seem to calm myself down about them. Since I don’t have any serious pain now and am fine enough to type and post on here, I wanted to see if it could be heart related at all?

I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

Unfortunately, only employees who have passed the “drink test” are allowed to make and serve drinks, so this rules out most baristas when it comes to busy rushes. This is COMPANY POLICY. I have no say or control whatsoever, i just work here.  Our team can apparently get in trouble if employees who haven’t passed the drink test are making and serving drinks to the public. They also don’t know what goes in the drinks. Im a shift lead and have passed the drink test, and a lot of times i’m the only one on shift who’s able to make drinks so it gets stressful at times, and obviously a lot slower when finishing drinks than it would be when there are other eligible employees working with me. It works, just a little  slower. I understand that it’s frustrating when your coffee is taking a long time to come out, but when you come in with a group of 20 people as i’m already working on other drinks and keeping track of baristas and running around etc, and there is ONE person making drinks for the entire morning, it will take longer. Especially if you’re standing 2 feet away from me, hovering over the counter, watching my every move while i’m making your drink from behind the bar, asking me “did you just forget about my mocha?” and “where’s my drink?”

Anywho, that was just for context. I had finished a hazelnut latte and called it out, nobody from that group came to claim their drink for about 15 minutes. The guy comes up, grabs the drink, and 5 minutes later he comes back up and asks him where his other hazelnut latte is. I didn’t know there were two since it was so busy, but i confirmed there was two and i told him i’d get started on it right away. He then said, “Well can you move it along this time? Took you long enough to make this one” to which i replied “I’m the only one making drinks right now.”

I've read numerous posts and comments here, and I'm concluding this:

Graph: [https://imgur.com/a/ittFeAo](https://imgur.com/a/ittFeAo)

Broadly, there are three categories of expenses -

1. Recurring (or Fixed): Utilities, mortgage payments, bills, subscriptions, rent, etc (these may not be the same every month, but you can't change or avoid them)
2. Non-monthly Expenses: Car repair, flight tickets, gifts, clothes, etc (again, not so much control over, but varies widely each month)
3. Discretionary: Groceries, dining out, coffees, takeouts, etc (things that can be controlled)

Here's my theory:

Once my paycheck comes, a certain amount goes towards Recurring expenses (pretty straightforward)

Then, I proceed to transfer some amount of the paycheck to a savings account (call it sinking funds) each month. If I had a non-monthly expense occur, I would use my credit card and transfer the money back from savings to pay for the credit card bill at the end of month.

Discretionary is what matters the most. I not only track this, but also check how much money is left once in a while before I make that order on UberEats or before I buy that expensive organic dragon fruit.

Now, all my focus goes into this discretionary spending. I fill the gap between the budgeting and spending by taking a look at it before buying anything.

So, instead of budgeting with 50 categories, I just use this. I only dig into categories if I end up spending too much money and don't know how it added up. But, checking the needle every time makes sure that ik the pulse of my money flow.

I was thinking about buying a stovetop percolator in case of a power outage (Happens a couple times a year where I live). And I remembered I had my mom's vintage 1970's Golden Yellow percolator in my ""stuff I never use"" cabinet. I dug it out and made a pot. Holy cow what a difference it makes. The flavor is so full and rich and round. Google says that's because the repeated passing through the grounds allows much more of the oils and essence to be brought out. And yeah, it's a hella nice caffeine hit LOL. 

This is a 6-cup pot, (or three big mugs) and I can only drink one big mug of this a day. So I put the rest of it in the fridge, and have two more mornings of coffee. The coffee is so rich, it holds the flavor for those two days, even cold. They're a pain in the ass to wash, I can see why they fell out of favor. But if you lllllllove coffee, it's worth it. You can't even compare it to regular drip. I've been lamenting for years that coffee just is never great. I bought darker and darker roasts and could never find the fullness I wanted from a good cup of coffee. Turns out it was never the bean, it was about the process. This even beats pourover by a mile. Again, if you lllllllove coffee, do yourself a solid and try it. 

I did go ahead and buy a new percolator with a wooden handle that stays cool. My mother's will remain pristine, and hang out on display with my other vintage knickie-knacks.

1n59h9d,https://www.politico.eu/article/naples-italy-tourism-housing-cities/,‘Naples is dead’: How overtourism is hollowing out Italian cities,"##Rising numbers of visitors are swamping the locals, making housing scarce, increasing pollution and even emptying churches.

Via dei Tribunali is one of Naples’ busiest arteries, filled with restaurants and shops. Down one of its side alleys stands a bronze statue of Pulcinella, the trickster who has long symbolized the city. In high season, the queue to rub his nose can stretch half a kilometer as tourists chase an ancient Neapolitan good-luck ritual.

But locals know that tradition is fake.

The statue was erected only in the 2010s, and was largely ignored by Neapolitans. Only in recent years influencers discovered it, fabricated a folkloric backstory, and suddenly no tourist felt their trip to Naples was complete without it. The result is a paradoxical “local” tradition without any locals — and a good example of what overtourism is doing to Italian cities.

“The historic center of Naples is dead,” said sociologist and activist Francesco Calicchia, who lives and works in the working-class Sanità neighborhood. “Those streets aren’t neighborhoods anymore. There are no Neapolitans left, no real life left. They’ve become playgrounds, open-air shopping malls.”

Sipping a coffee on Via Foria, just outside the tourist grid, he noticed a shirtless man ambling past, dragging a suitcase down the middle of the street. “The problem,” Calicchia said, eying the man cutting across the street, “is that this kind of tourism isn’t being managed or controlled.”

Many cities across Italy are wrestling with the same pressures. But Naples — with its tangled history and outspoken residents — offers a particularly vivid case study.

Activists, workers, experts and local politicians all argue that overtourism is hollowing out the fabric of the city — and while it’s often touted as a source of money and jobs, they say it mostly enriches the wealthy instead.

One of the main ways tourism is reshaping Naples is through its impact on housing.

“Short-term rentals have grown exponentially in Naples, just like in other Italian cities,” said Chiara Capretti, a municipal councilor and member of Resta Abitante — an association defending the right to housing — as she hunted for a free table in the tourist-clogged San Domenico Square.

Visitors are drawn to Naples and to Italy for what they see as authenticity — vibrant street life, colorful murals, food culture and the warmth of local people. But as residents are priced out, that very authenticity is eroding.

Even religious practices are changing. Churches that once served as gathering places for residents are now tourist attractions, pushing worship out of the historic center.",3,1756683317.0,europes,0,1.0,False

Hey LinkedIn friends! Ever found yourself caught in the debate about the perfect blog length? Well, I've just read an enlightening article that introduces a refreshing perspective. Let me give you a sneak peek:

🔥 **The Great Blog Length Debate:**
   - **Camp One:** Short and sweet attracts skimmers.
   - **Camp Two:** Longer, in-depth pieces captivate committed readers.

But why choose one when you can embrace both with the innovative concept of **Dynamic Layering**?

🎉 **Dynamic Layering: The Best of Both Worlds**
   - **Snackable Insights:** Hook busy readers with bolded highlights and bullet points.
   - **Emotional Hooks:** Use stories and humor to engage casual browsers.
   - **Analytical Depth:** Provide detailed analysis for those who crave a deeper dive.

This technique ensures every type of reader—from the skimmer scrolling with one eye on their phone, to the deep diver savoring every word with a cup of coffee—finds value in your writing.

Not only does Dynamic Layering make your articles incredibly engaging, but it also respects your readers' time and preferences.

✨ **Why It Matters:**
   - Increase your audience engagement by catering to varied reading styles.
   - Make your content more memorable and impactful.
   - Build a loyal readership that trusts your unique presentation style.

Ever had one of those days where you’re sitting at your desk, coffee in hand, trying to convince the universe (or yourself) that *today* is the day you’ll finally create that viral piece of content? You know, the one that skyrockets you to content-crafting glory? 🙌 

Well, buckle up, because I'm about to spill the beans on something that might just change the game for you. Yep, I’m talking about my **Viral Blueprint Vault**. And guess what? It’s about to expire! 😱

Picture this: A treasure chest filled with AI content strategies and growth hacks that have helped me (and many others) create that elusive piece of content everyone talks about. Sounds dreamy, right? Here’s a quick rundown of what’s inside:

- **AI-Powered Content Generators**: Tools that can transform your ideas into high-quality text faster than you can say “content is king.” 
- **Growth Hacks That Work**: Seriously, some of these tips have me wondering if I accidentally unlocked a cheat code.
- **Real-Life Examples**: Because who doesn’t love a good success story? See how others have used these strategies to go from zero to viral. 
- **Timing Tips**: Find out when you should hit that “post” button for maximum engagement. Spoiler: It’s not just about your audience’s coffee habits! 

Now, I know what you're thinking – “But how do I know it’ll work for me?” Here’s the thing: these are not just random tips I found on the internet. I’ve tested these blueprints and watched them do their magic time and time again. I remember the first time I implemented one of these strategies — it felt like I’d finally cracked the code! It was exhilarating. 🚀 

And let’s be real: we’re all in this together, fumbling through algorithm changes and trying to figure out what makes our audience tick. There’s no need to struggle on your own, right? Just think of all the time you could save instead of pulling your hair out over content ideas. For real, who needs that kind of stress?

So, if you’re ready to jump in and steal my secrets (no shame in that game 🙃), you’ll want to act fast because this vault is closing soon! Trust me, you won’t regret it. Besides, wouldn’t it be nice to find that content groove you’ve been searching for? 

Anyway, I’m super excited to hear if anyone’s already tried some of these hacks or if you plan to. How do you usually come up with your viral ideas? There's a bit of magic in collaboration, and I'm here for it! ✨

 Breakfast appointment, bright and early. Nothing better than coffee to start the day. I went to see a couple I’ve been working with for years (LEO the wife, TAURUS the husband). They live near Pier 17 — such a peaceful spot with beautiful bridge views.

Afterward, I was drained. So I went walking toward the water, weaving through construction until I found the only bench facing the Manhattan Bridge. Right beside me was the Jerry Driscoll Walk plaque, carved into a stone. The other benches all faced Brooklyn.

The railings were rusted by the East River waves but I liked that. We’ve all seen better days, just like those rails. I love my little city. 

I rolled some sativa to lift my spirit. The wind fought me, but I managed. As I smoked, I slipped into that in-between space where visions live. To see if I pick up anything. And i did 

**The Vision**

I saw a woman across the water, sitting by big flower pots and greenery. She looked at the empty seats  next to me and whispered: “Everything is going to be okay.” And then she was gone.

The waves suddenly grew stronger, splashing close to people sitting by the river. I was about to leave when I heard it: a whisper, firm but soft, “Sit. Please, she is coming!.”

So I sat. And chills ran through me — like I was anxious to see someone you’ve missed for years.

A  woman  walked past me in a Professional attire , in a gray business suit. Manicure neat, hair gracefully shifting from black to silver. She pulled out a blunt, smoked with relief, then lit a couple of cigarettes as she looked across at Brooklyn. Like if she was looking back at the women in my vision 

The vision-woman was suddenly beside me, watching her with pride, with joy. I knew what this was. I had a message for this woman !

**The Message**

I asked the universe for a sign if should talk to her . Immediately the wind picked up, the waves crashed harder, and it felt like I was being pulled forward the way a mother would tug her child by the ear. Commanding. 

I walked to her. Nervous, almost trembling. “Excuse me,” I said. I introduced myself quickly, assuring her I didn’t want money, I wasn’t here to bother her but someone was connecting through me and needed to speak.

My chest felt heavy, as if meeting someone I already knew. Her happiness became my concern, like I needed to comfort her: *It’s okay. I’m here now.*

I told her a maternal figure was present. That she wanted me to say: “Things are going to be okay. Fear is part of your process. And if you want a cigarette — then smoke it. It’s your money and your pleasure.”

She looked breathless. Stunned, but open. She nodded, giving me permission to go on. And then, just like that, I felt the presence leave.

I wished her a good day and walked back to my bench. A minute later, she passed me again. This time she stopped, looked me in the eye, and simply said: “Thank you.”

Her tears shone as she walked away. And at that moment, I knew exactly why I had to be there. Someone needed a message, and I was honored to deliver it.

Welcome to my life. I love all the feedback so far, and since so many of you asked me to keep sharing, here is the most recent encounter . You can call me psychic, medium, energy healer — or just Hazel.

**Morning Session** 

 Breakfast appointment, bright and early. Nothing better than coffee to start the day. I went to see a couple I’ve been working with for years (LEO the wife, TAURUS the husband). They live near Pier 17 — such a peaceful spot with beautiful bridge views.

I’ll never forget the first time I experienced this. I worked hard and stayed late nights. Always participated in extra projects. Gave my best ideas away in meetings where they barely got a nod. Inside that company, I felt invisible. No recognition, No promotion, Just silence. The day I left and started thriving somewhere else… the same people who overlooked me suddenly reached out:“ We always knew you were talented.”“We should’ve promoted you.”“Can we grab coffee?”Here’s the truth I wish I’d have learned before: Your value doesn’t depend on other people’s opinions of you. Sometimes you have to move from certain places to find yourself. The right workplace doesn’t just notice you, they empower you, so  if you feel overlooked today, please hear this: You are still valuable. Your skills are still needed. Your voice still matters. And when you sit at the right table, they won’t just acknowledge your worth. They’ll celebrate it. Have you ever felt underestimated until you left a company?

Of course I left room for him to talk and be reciprocal in the conversation, but after I’d ask him a question or ask about certain things in his life (hobbies, where he was from, his experience at our university since we wen to the same one), he give an incredibly brief answer and would just stare at me and we’d sit in silence for a bit. He would occasionally ask a question or start a topic, but for every 10 questions I asked, he would ask me 1 (if that). 

I’m all for silence, but when you’re on a date where you’re not doing an activity or eating, it can feel a little awkward when they aren’t really engaging in conversation. Before we left discussed possible plans to see a movie. And he texted me after and said he had great time talking. 

My question is, does this mean he’s not that interested? Or maybe I give off a friend vibe? I thought maybe I was being awkward or something and that’s why he wasn’t really speaking, but carrying a conversation for 3 hours was a little exhausting.

1n592m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1n592m1/marriott_downtown_omaha_review/,Marriott Downtown Omaha Review,"I recently stayed 3 nights at the Downtown Omaha Marriott and thought I’d offer a review since I didn’t see much online when I booked it. 

It is new, built on a couple of years ago so it doesn’t look outdated. However, once you get to the rooms you can see some care hasn’t been maintained. The door to the bathroom has chips missing that are very noticeable. The pool is stunning though and very relaxing. By far one of the stand outs with the property. 

As a platinum member, I had access to the lounge. Except every time I asked an employee about the service/meal times - I got different answers. It is also Labor Day weekend so the lounge was closed after Friday morning. I stayed Thursday night till Sunday morning. This was not told to me at check in but instead by a staff member working the lounge. The staff member checking me in, when inquiring about the lounge due to the holiday weekend (as I know closures for holidays are not uncommon) ensured me it would be open. I was able to get breakfast vouchers. Unlike other hotels though, they gave no compensation for the appetizers in the evening. When asking about the restaurant breakfast hours, there were three employees at the front desk - they all gave me a different time range. I still don’t really know when the meal time was but 9am was a safe choice. Additionally the lounge space was not unlocked to sit in or get water/coffee. 

The breakfast in the hotel was minimal - imagine a holiday in without a waffle maker. Also staff were confused about what the voucher covered. One telling us it covered everything on the menu, including the $40 wagyu breakfast steak, where in reality it only covered the buffet option. Our Sunday breakfast we had to sit overflow in the check-in area to eat because there was so many people and no one able to buss the tables. The buffet options ran out very quickly so it was hard to get food. 

When checking out, I didn’t check out. They checked me out and knocked on my door at 10am to ask me when I was leaving. Hotel checkout wasn’t till noon and I didn’t request a late checkout. But they were clearly ready to turn over my room. 

The location though is amazing. The walkability to the RiverFront and to Old Town made the stay worth it. Additionally it is a short walk (5 minutes) to the hotel’s parking lot. It is slightly cheaper than listed online ($25 vs $28). The pool was a standout as well. The lounge chairs were very comfortable and the pool bar was convenient (all though they seemed to make up their own hours and not follow the ones listed online). Also beers were different prices depending if you got it at the lobby bar or the pool bar with the pool bar being cheaper. The lounge is on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool and fitness center so it was very convenient for me. They placed out room on this floor as well. However, I’ve never stayed on the concierge floor and it have so much foot traffic - because of the pool and fitness center. 

If anyone has any questions I’d be happy to answer. I am not good at writing reviews so sorry for the rambling.

Work and studies have taken me across five countries, and while I love exploring, I’m now ready to build a cozy home —with the right person.

I’d love to meet someone in their 30s or 40s who’s who’s established in their own life and also ready for a life partner, a forever connection

I’m a deeply feeling introvert who spends a lot of time on health, fitness (yes, I’m a bit of a fanatic and proud of being in great shape), nutrition, and spirituality-lately learning more about Advaita. I throw myself into the things I care about, whether that’s work, friendships, or simply living everyday life with intention. I’m equally comfortable debating world affairs, swapping travel stories, or laughing over something completely silly.

I also know that two people coming together to build a life isn’t easy. What makes it work, I believe, are respect, trust, and a lasting friendship to carry you through the tougher parts.

Who I imagine you to be:

* You laugh easily, say funny things, and love when I do the same.
* You are my BFF and do not roll your eyes when I use the term BFF.
* You are damn smart – but not a snob about it. You are in love with life. Family comes first. 
* You do not mistake my warmth, love, and affection for weakness.
* You do what you love. You make the best of any situation.
* You share your chips with me. You will come with me for walks. 
* You love hard, fight fair, and balance modern independence with a touch of old-school kindness.
* Compassion and generosity guide your choices, and you always try to see the best in people.

Simply put, you inspire me and are inspired by me. That’s the kind of bond I’m looking for—one that’s deep and supportive, but also light-hearted and adventurous.

**So what say - shall we travel, smash patriarchy, cook healthy, work out often, make memories, and open our hearts and minds?**

Lots of trial and error and what feels like you need to be  biology grad student to navigate. Only lingering issue for me the past 18mo I cant fix is the brutal insomnia and  this gets exacerbated by intense exercise. It's destroying me


Started keto 2mo ago and loving everything about it..so far. Was sleeping amazing at the start, now back to crippling insomnia 1-4hr sleep per night. Some nights I try things that seem to be the rage for others: mag glycinate, l theanine, taurine, gaba. These used to be great in the past, now all further excite, songs looping in my head, muscle tightness. 

Famotodine same thing, seemed to work earlier this year (histamine?) and now it revs me up where im up literally the whole night.  Did unisom a couple times, 50/50 shot it works or keeps me up

Stumbled on Masterjohn (fascinating and tangled web) and caught something he said about carbohydrates fueling the methylation process/not eating high protein late at night. Hmmm....Could my keto approach be further negatively impacting my sleep? Coincidence and I need to get methylation on track? Histamine?

I don’t really workout just because I am active as it is at my job (warehouse) but I have some questions about different supplements and types. I obviously know what creatine and the closest type of powder that is remotely (I use the term loosely) connected to working out and being healthy is hydration powders. I get my caffeine from coffee and energy drinks, so the hydration powders I look for are caffeine free. 

I’ll just ask one question at a time…..I know there are numerous different types of powders i.e. some for pre workout, some for post (assume that is same as “recovery”), some to specifically build muscle and many more and some do both. 

1. This is labeled Intra or Intra-Workout: https://www.ghostlifestyle.com/collections/intra-workout?srsltid=AfmBOoroA22n2lZ6hqKMqQN6A2sO7mS9LwCBkj5iDqvV0iFkUNrNCOCo

When is the best time to cosume this? Description says you can do before working out, before or during a walk or even sitting at work desk…is this something i would take prior or after eating? Or substitution? Just wanted to try something new

2. Ghost has a Legend lineup which, in my guess, is directed for people who are actually having a working session. Comes off as not as potent as creatine, less side effects but not something you take if your not being active or even actually working out 

Ok, this is more complicated that i assumed. All of these are preworkout EXCEPT for the INTRA. The rest are in the pre-workout tab, and then is Intra and then post workout
In the Pre-workout, they got some labeled Burn, some labeled Pump “natty”, size “muscle builder”.

Sorry if this is confusing but if i just causally work out at work 5 days a week, and currently do the hydration from Redmond, what do you recommend i try that wont totally throw me off because I am guessing some of these if you take them and don’t work out, there either a waste or will make you feel a certain type of way, so I just want something that will help hydration and I don’t mind something to help build muscle or even side effects, but I don’t lift weights, I don’t plan on being in the gym. My workout is lifting cases and I do that about 55-60 hrs a week.

I don’t really workout just because I am active as it is at my job (warehouse) but I have some questions about different supplements and types. I obviously know what creatine and the closest type of powder that is remotely (I use the term loosely) connected to working out and being healthy is hydration powders. I get my caffeine from coffee and energy drinks, so the hydration powders I look for are caffeine free. 

I’ll just ask one question at a time…..I know there are numerous different types of powders i.e. some for pre workout, some for post (assume that is same as “recovery”), some to specifically build muscle and many more and some do both. 

1. This is labeled Intra or Intra-Workout: https://www.ghostlifestyle.com/collections/intra-workout?srsltid=AfmBOoroA22n2lZ6hqKMqQN6A2sO7mS9LwCBkj5iDqvV0iFkUNrNCOCo

When is the best time to cosume this? Description says you can do before working out, before or during a walk or even sitting at work desk…is this something i would take prior or after eating? Or substitution? Just wanted to try something new

2. Ghost has a Legend lineup which, in my guess, is directed for people who are actually having a working session. Comes off as not as potent as creatine, less side effects but not something you take if your not being active or even actually working out 

Ok, this is more complicated that i assumed. All of these are preworkout EXCEPT for the INTRA. The rest are in the pre-workout tab, and then is Intra and then post workout
In the Pre-workout, they got some labeled Burn, some labeled Pump “natty”, size “muscle builder”.

Sorry if this is confusing but if i just causally work out at work 5 days a week, and currently do the hydration from Redmond, what do you recommend i try that wont totally throw me off because I am guessing some of these if you take them and don’t work out, there either a waste or will make you feel a certain type of way, so I just want something that will help hydration and I don’t mind something to help build muscle or even side effects, but I don’t lift weights, I don’t plan on being in the gym. My workout is lifting cases and I do that about 55-60 hrs a week.
