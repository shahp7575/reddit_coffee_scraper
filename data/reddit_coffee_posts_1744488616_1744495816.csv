1jxsprl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCBitches/comments/1jxsprl/yoga_friends/,Yoga friends?,"Hi lovelies, I’ve had luck connecting with cool, likeminded women through this subreddit so here goes another post. Would anyone be interested in going to yoga together and occasionally grabbing a coffee/tea/drink before or after class to chat about everything and anything we want? Before I moved here, I had two great yogi friends I went to classes with, and I miss having that kind of casual, low maintenance friendship. 

Some specifics:
- I go to Flow on 14th and also Yoga District on 14th and Dupont (I’ll probably stick with Yoga District but still deciding which studio I prefer) 
- I’m 31 so preferably you’re in your late 20s-early 30s though I believe people can be friends at any age as long as other things align :) 
- I tend to go to 1-2 classes a week (though I want to do more) so we can also use this for accountability! 
- Obvs down to make plans for more than yoga if we vibe and have similar interests 
- Besides yoga, I’m also into theater, live music and concerts, walks with my little dog, the occasional night out dancing, art classes (painting, pottery, drawing, crochet, you name it I’ll do it), museum hangs, reading dates, picnics, and grabbing matcha and going on a hot girl walk so if any of that resonates please reach out!! 

If there’s a ton of interest maybe we can explore having a little group but I’ll wait and see",1,1744495657.0,DCBitches,0,1.0,False
1jxslkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/minibikes/comments/1jxslkp/coleman_ct100u_revival_need_some_parts_suggestions/,"Coleman CT100U revival, need some parts suggestions","Friend of mine picked up a brand new ct100u for his kids, but it's been sitting neglected for about 4 years so wouldn't even try to start.  He asked me if I could rescue it and I'm giving it my best shot.  The tank was coffee soup inside, so I just bought a new one and a new carb, the air filter was a home for wayward mud daubers so I replaced that too.  Throttle cable was locked down, so I got that new and a new start/stop switch and she started great literally on the first pull.  I'm a much bigger dude than his kids, so no surprise it bogged down quite a bit when I took her for a test drive, but once I made it about 3 blocks she was up to some significant speed.  I don't know much about the carb tuning so I hope it's pretty close right out of the box.  Opened my gps app and it said I made it up to 29.7 mph which impressed me considering I'm about 220 lbs.  I think the brakes need some adjusting because they were pretty noisy but seem to work like they should.  Wheel bearings seem ok, but I wouldn't be opposed to changing them if it's easy.  My main problem is the drive gear.  The chain was pretty caked with rust so I soaked it in motor oil for a couple days and it turns pretty well. The rear gear looks like the teeth are worn down, but he says it has little to no run time.  After the third hi speed pass to clean out the cobwebs, the chain decided it didn't want to live on the sprocket anymore so I got to push her a half mile home lol.  I figured a new set of sprockets and a good chain was in the plan anyways, I'm just not sure which ones to get.  The goog says it came with a 65 tooth rear, but all the kits I see with 65 tooth also come with extra chain links, so I'm thinking maybe it's 60 from the factory.  What would y'all recommend?  I'm not opposed to changing both sprockets and a new chain, as I'd like it to be extremely safe and reliable for his kids.  They have some hills on their property, but the biggest kid is currently only about 60 lbs, so I think stock gear ratio should be fine. If anything I'd rather reduce top speed and add some get up and go.  Hard to gauge how fast it'll take off with a munchkin on board, being much bigger myself, but it seems extremely boggy at the moment.  Any suggestions on gear ratios, brands to go with or stay away from, links to parts would be great.  Also any advice on wheel bearings and chain guide roller whatever that thing is called, greatly appreciated.  Cleaned up this thing appears to be pretty fun, I'm donating one of my full face helmets to the project in hopes his kids will be safe haha.  Thanks in advance, let me know if I missed anything I should add to the fix list too.

1jxshkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jxshkd/the_bus_1011/,The Bus 10-11,"**Chapter 10**

 **All In**

My eyes were bloodshot. Pins and needles prickled through my limbs, starting in my fingertips and spreading down to my toes. Three days. It had been three days since Chris was taken—three days without sleep, staying ever vigilant, tracking the movements of the newly increased staff. I downed another shot of espresso, the bitter taste no longer a shock, only feeding the nervous energy twisting inside me. My brain screamed for rest, but every time I closed my eyes, paranoia clawed at the back of my mind. Did the staff notice what I was doing? Why did that passenger look at me like that? Could she be working for the bus? My pulse quickened. I shook my head violently, trying to knock the cobwebs loose. I needed to focus.

My plan was starting to come together, but everything felt more fragile with each passing minute. Since Chris was taken, the staff had ramped up their presence, standing like sentinels to keep the peace. The once impenetrable door was now doubly fortified, more guards constantly watching. I noted every shift change, every step they took, scanning for a weak point in their routine—anything I could exploit. The other passengers? They had retreated further into themselves, more distant and detached than ever, their apathy gnawing at my already frayed nerves.

I couldn’t take this much longer. My mind was unraveling. I had to act—and I had to do it tonight. As far as plans go, I thought, mine wasn't terrible. First, I needed to collect all of my things so that I could act at a moment's notice. Second, I needed to wait until dinner. For the last few days, the staff had been more lax while placing food out on the buffet. And thankfully the passengers were too scared to say anything even if they were to notice me. Third, while the staff were preoccupied setting out the food, I would sneak into the staff access corridor. It was risky but I figured the hall would be relatively empty because the staff would be feeding other passengers. Fourth, hope for the best. As the thought hit me, I slumped, in my seat. A lot of this plan revolved around ifs and did little to set my slipping sanity at ease. 

Little by little, I grabbed my belongings, taking my time to hopefully not attract any attention. Dinner was drawing near and my knees began to shake, and my palms began to sweat. Adrenaline was coursing through my entire body all at once, causing me to feel queasy. I looked down at my watch, 7:27 PM, I had just over thirty minutes to go over my plan one last time to make final preparations. I headed back to my secluded seat to wait out what time I had left when I noticed someone waiting for me. Alarm bells in my brain rang incessantly. Had someone discovered my plan? How? My face turned white as a sheet and I nearly vomited where I stood. I had to keep my composure, no one knew anything. How could they? I hadn't spoken to anyone in days. As I neared the seat, I saw it was the old man from a few days ago.

""Oh, hey there youngster."" He greeted. ""I seen you been awful quiet these last couple days. I hope I ain't intrudin' or nothin.'""

""No, not intruding. Just getting ready for dinner."" I said, with a forced grin.

""I'm sorry for all your friends gettin' nabbed, I know this place can get kinda lonely."" 

""Oh, it's, uh...it's nothing,"" I muttered, nervousness straining my vocal cords.

""Nonsense, I seen it's been eating you up and I'd hate for you to make the same mistake that young lady did."" I nearly fainted from fright, was he on to me? ""I just wanted to stop by and say that if you need anything, I can always make time to chat. I ain't been able to sleep good since what's 'er name up n left, and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I let it happen again."" I stifled a sigh of relief when it dawned on me that he knew nothing about my plan, but a pang of guilt loomed heavily on my shoulders. When I leave, will this kind old man blame himself? Before I could say anything else, the sound of carts being pushed down the hall echoed throughout the cabin. I looked down at my watch, 8:00 on the dot. Time was of the essence so my conscience had to wait. I thanked the man for his concern and quickly brushed past him. 

I clutched my bag with a death grip, almost like if I strangled it hard enough, it would increase my chances of success. My temples pulsed with adrenaline as I stealthily moved up the aisle. My heart thumped like a war drum with each step but I remained on guard, none of the staff's monements went unnoticed. When suddenly a staff member locked eyes with me. For an endless second, their gaze felt like it burned right through me, making me uneasy, as if they could read my mind. I quickly popped into a crowd of people, hoping it would mask my intentions, my eyes locked on the staff corridor. A bead of sweat rolled down my forehead into my eye. I released a breath I wasn't aware I was holding, trying in vain to calm my blazing nerves. I moved with the mass of people like a herd of cattle being brought to a feeding trough. Feeling sufficiently incognito, I poked my head out of the crowd scanning the room for any staff looking my way. To my utter horror, however, I noticed something I had never seen before. There was a guard at the access door. My heart sank and I paused. Every neuron in my brain fired all at once. There was no way I could get in there undetected. No way unless... Without thinking, I screamed, ""Stop shoving me!"" and wildly pushed a passenger into a staff member rolling a food cart. Food exploded everywhere, plates clattering to the ground. Gasps and shouts filled the air as passengers stumbled over each other in the chaos. The staff member’s face twisted in annoyance as they bent to clean up the mess, giving me the window I needed.

I slunk back into the crowd of people hoping no one would pin the incident on me and be able to sneak away from the crowd unnoticed. I held my breath, willing myself invisible as I slipped from the edge of the fray. Once I emerged, everyone was focused on the mess. Everyone including the guard. Absorbed in the chaos, they took a precious second to turn their back on the door. Just the second I needed to close the gap and enter unnoticed. As quickly and quietly as the wind, I snuck to the door, fearing that any second, I would feel someone slam up against me like they did with Chris. But that moment never came. I reached the door unmolested and equally important unnoticed. I opened the door, grinning ear to ear. The sheer joy in my heart at the improbability of my plan working nearly made me scream but my elation was quashed as I saw what lay in front of me. 

The hall stretched endlessly in every direction, doors stacked on doors, walls twisting like veins in some enormous beast. Buzzing fluorescent lights cast cold, flickering shadows, each corner a portal to more uncertainty. It wasn’t just a corridor—it was a nightmare come to life. My stomach churned, and for the first time since stepping on this bus, I felt truly lost.

 I gawked, mouth wide open and a tear rolled down my face. Whatever this place was, I thought, it wasn't a bus. My stomach dropped, and a wave of terror rushed over me. I thought I’d been braced for anything, but this… I collapsed to the ground in a heap. Exhaustion had taken hold of me. It took every ounce of willpower I could muster to keep my eyes from closing. I gritted my teeth and forced myself into a sitting position. For an eternity I sat there, not knowing what to do or where to go. I knew I couldn't stay but I didn't know where to begin either. Chris and Misty could be anywhere if they were even still alive. The weight of realization hit me like a runaway train. 

The walls seemed to close in on me, mockingly. I felt a lump in my throat form and tears would have followed if I hadn't been so utterly spent. Suddenly, the doorknob behind me rattled, and instinctively, I jumped to my feet and locked the door. I was no longer safe and had to make a decision. The rattling on the door became louder and louder. There was a door down the hall not thirty feet away. I had no idea where it would lead me but it was my only choice. With my energy reserves running on fumes, I raced as quickly as I could to the unknown door. I gripped the handle, my heart hammering against my ribs. Behind me, the rattling grew louder, more urgent, like the staff were seconds away from breaking through. I swallowed hard and pulled the door open, stepping into the unknown with nothing but a whispered prayer.



**Chapter 11**

**Ante Up**

I slammed the door behind me, chest heaving and hands shaking. I thought for sure someone would break down the door, and the staff would be on me any minute. But as the seconds came and went, I was met with nothing. Nothing but the sounds emanating from the new room I found myself in. It was dark. Perfect for hiding out until I could come up with a new plan. My legs felt like gelatine and I wanted nothing more than to climb into my bed. I wobbled over to an unoccupied seat, barely able to register my surroundings, and flopped face-first onto the bench. The second I closed my eyes, consciousness left me and I entered a deep, dreamless sleep.

\*\*\*

""Hey, you!""

My heart lept into my throat, and I jumped up from my slumber. I've been caught, I thought to myself. My eyes, still not adjusted from waking couldn't quite make out the imposing figure in front of me. I stammered incoherently, madly rubbing my eyes to assess my surroundings. What stood in front of me, however, wasn't at all who I expected. It was, in fact, vaguely familiar.

""You gonna stand there and gawk at me, or you gonna let me bye? And why were you sleeping on my bag?"" The giant of a man asked brows furrowed.

""I, uh,..."" I tried to form a coherent sentence but the words wouldn't form.

""You uh? The fuck does that mean, you uh?""

""S...sorry, I didn't know this was yours. You're not with the staff?"" I asked, holding on to hope.

""What? No. But if I catch you messing with my shit again, you'll wish I was.""

""Again, I'm sorry. I didn't know this was yours."" I held out my hand in an attempt to smooth things over. ""My name is...""

""I don't care what your name is."" He interrupted. ""Just, leave me alone. Go bother someone else.""

Perplexed and embarrassed, my cheeks turned a rosy red and I stood there in stunned silence for a moment. I regained my bearings and with a forced grin, walked past him. I was relieved he wasn't part of the staff, but his face, I could have sworn I had seen this man before. He had a sharp jawline like one carved from granite. His muscle definition, put the Greek gods to shame, but for the life of me, I just couldn't place him.

Trying to shake off the unsettling encounter, I walked toward the front of the cabin. It was much larger than the last. It was colorful but dingey. The room was filled with the acrid stench of old cigarettes and the cacophonous sound of a casino. There had to be at least three hundred people in here, all of them glued to one game of chance or another. There were slot machines, card tables roulette tables, and any other form of gambling you could think of. To call it overwhelming was an understatement.

My stomach rumbled, interrupting my train of thought, reminding me I had barely eaten the last few days. I neared the buffet hoping to eat my fill but what lay before me was unappetizing, to say the least. The food looked like it had been sitting out for a day or two, yet my stomach groaned again telling me I had little choice.

I grabbed what passed as food here and settled into a vacant seat, this time making sure there were no one's belongings around me. The pancakes I had tasted like cardboard and the coffee like motor oil. Regardless, I scarfed them down with reckless abandon. As I ate, I glanced around the room and realized I was the only one not engrossed in a game.

The passengers' gaunt faces and glazed eyes gave the eerie impression they'd melded into the machines themselves. I watched the bizarre scene for some time—a sea of people going through the motions. A shiver ran down my spine as a grown man began blubbering in anguished sobs while his feeble arm reached for the lever.

Alarm bells began ringing in my head, begging me to run back to where I came from. But my mission still needed to be completed. No matter what, I needed to find Chris and Misty. I set my dishes down and straightened my clothes. It was time to ask around.

I walked toward a row of slot machines. Their garish lights flashed brightly, and their deafening chimes pounded relentlessly against my eardrums. A line of passengers sat quietly, playing their games. I was desperate to ask around but wary of drawing attention. I needed to blend in. Hesitantly, I fished a handful of coins from my pocket and inserted them into the machine. The lights flashed in a nauseating pattern before landing on two bells and a cherry. A lifeless synthetic voice emanated from the machine, saying ""You lose. Try again."" I had never gambled before. All throughout my childhood, my father told me it was a ""sucker's game"" and that I should stay away from it. I had always taken his word for it, but something about this machine was drawing me in.

Focus! My brain screamed, snapping me out of the game's trance. I stuffed the coins in my hand back in my pocket and glanced at the pale, ghoulish old woman beside me. A cigarette smoldering in one hand while the other gripped the slot machine lever with a death-like clutch. Her stony expression and deep-set wrinkles spoke of countless hours wasted. My pulse quickened—I needed to ask her about Chris and Misty, but words felt lodged in my throat. Before I could rein in my nerves, I blurted, ""You look really old, you must have been here for a while."" The words spilled out, raw and clumsy. My face flushed beet red as I reflexively covered my mouth, mortified. I couldn't believe I just said that.

""I...I'm so sorry, I...I didn't mean that. What I meant to say was..."" I trailed off. The woman hadn't moved, hadn't acknowledged my existence let alone my unintentional insult. She just sat there, staring at the slot machine, mouth agape, eyes glazed over. ""M...Mam?"" I took a step toward her...nothing. I raised my hand and waved it in front of her. Without warning, she jerked the lever in her hand causing me to jump back reflexively. A yelp escaped my throat as I tripped over my seat into the arms of a passing gambler. I looked up, my embarrassment now cranked up to eleven. ""I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to..."" It was the same man from earlier, the same chiseled features glaring at me, thinly veiled annoyance plastered onto his face.

""You again? Why can't you just leave me alone?"" He sighed.

""I didn't mean to fall on you. I was trying to talk to the lady sitting next to me."" I answered, trying to excuse myself. He looked me up and down for a moment and then looked at the woman, still solely focused on her gambling.

""Good luck trying to talk to these people. They aren't the chatty type."" He said dismissively. I stood there confused but still determined to get some information on the whereabouts of my friends. He began to leave. I couldn't let him, not until I had information.

""Have any new people come through here the last few days?"" I blurted out. He stopped in his tracks, back turned, then turned around to face me.

""Why?"" He asked, a dubious expression written on his face.

""They're my friends. They were taken by the staff and I don't want them to get hurt."" I exclaimed, desperation flowing from my words. His eyes narrowed, and he scoffed, turning his back once again. I raced forward to cut him off. ""Please! They could be in danger!"" I implored.

""Not my problem."" He said blankly, not making eye contact as he strode to his seat. He sat his hulking frame down, fishing coins from his pockets and inserting them into the machine.

""Sir,"" I stammered."" I'm begging you. If you have any information, you could help me save two innocent people's lives.""

""Innocent?"" He mockingly laughed. ""There are no innocent people on the bus.""

""These people are!"" I exclaimed in desperation. ""If you had seen the things I'd seen..."" I trailed off, unsure how much information to reveal. ""I think this bus might be evil,"" I whispered, hoping our conversation went unheard. He turned toward me, an incredulous look woven into every millimeter of his face. When suddenly, he burst into laughter.

""You...you think..."" He could hardly catch his breath in between words. ""The bus might...be evil?"" He bellowed out laughs, loud enough to wake the dead.

""Shhh!"" I exclaimed, lowering my head and scanning my surroundings. ""They'll hear you!"" He turned to the passenger nearest to him and clapped them on the shoulder.

""You hear that? ...said the bus might be evil!"" His laughter was dying down to a hearty chuckle while he wiped a tear from his eye. Mortified, I began looking for an exit to make my escape, when the giant man looked back at me, his amusement dying, and said, ""Quit your worrying. None of them can hear you. Most of the people here are too busy playing their stupid games to care."" My shoulders relaxed feeling much more at ease yet incredibly unnerved by this revelation.

""Most of them? What about the others?""

""I said quit worrying,"" he repeated, his voice edged with finality, though something in his tone faltered, just for a second. I wanted to argue, to press him for more, but the tension in his posture stopped me cold.

""Can you please help me?"" I begged, my voice barely more than a whisper. At that moment, I felt smaller than ever—just another problem he didn't want to deal with.

For a fleeting moment, his expression softened, the hardness in his eyes giving way to something raw and distant. He looked away, jaw tightening as if trying to force down a thought he didn't want to share.

""I can't help you..."" he muttered, almost too low to hear. Then, louder, ""I can't even help myself."" His eyes darted back to me, now blazing with something sharper, harsher—a warning.

""Just fuck off and leave me alone,"" he snapped, his voice a blade cutting through the uneasy quiet around us.

My blood boiled, and my fists clenched instinctively. What was this guy's problem? I'd risked so much coming here, and all he'd done was treat me like a pest. Standing from my seat, eyes blazing, I stepped forward.

""I don't know who you are or what your deal is, but I'm not leaving without answers,"" I said, my voice steady despite the pounding in my chest. ""I'm risking my life to find my friends, and I won't let some bitter asshole like you stand in my way. So, I'll ask you one last time—have you seen them?""

A tense moment passed, adrenaline coursing through my veins. He could crush me in an instant, and I braced myself for the inevitable. But I didn't move.

The man stood, his towering frame casting a shadow over me. His eyes burned through mine, searching for something. I swallowed hard, my fists clenched, waiting for the first blow that never came.

""You gonna beat it out of me?"" he finally asked, his voice low and measured.

""No,"" I said, my voice cracking.

A flicker of something—confusion? Curiosity?—crossed his face. ""You really don't know who I am?""

""Should I?"" I asked, bewildered. His face tugged at the edge of my memory, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't place him.

""That's a relief,"" he said with a sigh, sitting back down and resuming his gameplay. Unsure how to proceed, I cautiously took the seat next to him.

""You do look familiar,"" I ventured, my brain working overtime to place the man. ""Have we met before?""

""Maybe,"" he muttered, his focus still on the slot machine.

""Wait a second..."" I paused, fragments of a memory scratching at the edges of my mind. A football game on TV, my dad yelling at the screen. That jawline, those shoulders... ""You were on my dad's favorite football team, weren't you?""

He stiffened slightly, his shoulders tensing. He didn't answer, but his silence spoke volumes.

""Yeah, you were!"" I said, growing more certain. ""I'm not really into sports, but I remember Dad talking about you. What was your name? Paul, Phil...""

""Preston,"" he interrupted, his voice low. ""Preston Farrow."" He still wouldn't look at me, his eyes fixed firmly on the machine in front of him.

""That's right, Preston Farrow! My dad talked about you all the time!"" I exclaimed. Then I noticed him shift uncomfortably in his seat, his jaw tightening.

""Let me guess,"" he said, his voice dripping with weary sarcasm. ""Preston's a lazy prima donna. He never should have been drafted and set the team back a decade, right?""

I frowned, surprised by his self-deprecation. ""No, he loved you. He loved the whole team.""

Preston scoffed, shaking his head. ""That's new. Most people just tell me I ruined their childhoods or some shit. Wanna swap dads?""

The question caught me off guard. ""He passed, a few years ago,"" I said quietly, my gaze falling to the floor.

Preston froze for a moment, his lips pursed, and his face remained unreadable. ""I wish I were that lucky,"" he muttered under his breath, his voice like a low growl.

I looked up sharply. ""You don't mean that!""

He leaned back in his chair, his smirk cold and distant. ""Oh, I mean it,"" he said, voice steady but cutting. ""That man was a bastard. Nothing I ever did was good enough for him. Win the game? 'You didn't score enough.' Set a record? 'Must've been a weak year.' Drafted first overall? 'Only because they had no better options.'""

His laugh was bitter, hollow. ""I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat. You got to say goodbye. Me? I'll be happy if I get to spit on his grave."" I sat in my seat, too stunned to speak, my jaw nearly hitting the floor. The weight of his words hung heavy in the air, and for a moment, the only sound was the incessant chime of the slot machines.

I swallowed hard and said, ""Is that why...""

""Why I'm such an asshole?"" he interrupted, still staring at the machine. His tone wasn't angry this time—just tired, as if the words themselves weighed too much to carry.

""N...no,"" I stammered, my voice barely audible. ""I was going to ask if that's why you're here to get away from your dad.""

Preston reached for the lever but stopped, his hand hovering over it. His jaw tightened, and for a long moment, he just stared at the machine, the flashing lights reflecting in his eyes.

""Among other things,"" he said finally, as he pulled the lever and fell back into a slump.

""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked, sympathetically. He perked up from his chair and glared at me.

""Why should I tell you anything?"" His icy blue eyes locked onto mine, sharp and unyielding, like a cornered animal ready to make his escape. The weight of his gaze rooted me in place, my palms clammy and my breath shallow. Time seemed to stretch, the muffled hum of the casino fading into a dull buzz. For a moment, I wondered if I'd pushed too far, poked at something better left buried. But with nothing to lose and everything to gain, I steeled myself and pushed forward just a little bit more.

""Because I don't know you,"" I breathed, my voice barely above a whisper.

He grit his teeth, the flicker of something unreadable crossing his face. Anger? Pain? I couldn't tell. The space between us crackled like static, and for a moment, I thought he might explode—or walk away for good. His eyes darted away, his posture shifting as his shoulders relaxed ever so slightly. A faint, almost imperceptible smile tugged at the corners of his lips, though his voice was laced with bitter amusement. ""You got me there."" He crossed his arms and leaned back in his chair and let out a long sigh. ""So, what do you want to know?""",1,1744495013.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Can you explain to me what the upper class of the United States has done to the economy in the style of a Tim Dillon rant?

Result:

Alright, buckle up, because we’re diving into the cesspool of American economics, Tim Dillon-style, where the upper class—those caviar-slurping, yacht-humping elitists—have turned the whole system into their personal piñata, and guess who’s getting the candy? Not you, that’s for damn sure!
Picture this: a bunch of Wall Street suits and Silicon Valley overlords, sitting in their glass towers, sipping $400 coffee flown in from some mountain nobody can pronounce, deciding the fate of the working stiff. These are the people who tanked the economy in ’08 with their “whoopsie-daisy” mortgage scams—bundling garbage loans like they were wrapping Christmas presents, selling them to pension funds, and then crying to Uncle Sam for a bailout when it all went kaboom. Trillions in taxpayer money, poof, into their bonus checks, while Main Street got foreclosures and pink slips. And they had the balls to call it “too big to fail.” Too big to fail? More like too rich to care!
Fast forward, they’re still at it, rigging the game. Tax codes? Written by their Ivy League buddies in Congress so their offshore accounts stay fatter than a foie gras goose. They dodge taxes like it’s an Olympic sport—Apple’s got more money stashed in Ireland than Ireland’s got potatoes! Meanwhile, you’re getting audited for claiming a $12 home office deduction. They’ve turned loopholes into an art form—capital gains, carried interest, “charitable” foundations that just buy them naming rights on museum wings. It’s a rigged casino, and they’re the house.
Then there’s the stock market, their personal slot machine. They pump it with insider trades and algorithms that’d make Einstein weep, while you’re told to “invest for the long haul” in your sad little 401(k). They crash it, they pump it, they short it, they meme it—GameStop, anyone?—and walk away with billions while Reddit bros are left holding the bag. And don’t get me started on inflation! They print money like it’s Monopoly cash to bail out their hedge funds, and suddenly your grocery bill looks like a car payment. Eggs are $9, and you’re wondering if you can refinance your avocado toast.
Oh, and jobs? They shipped those to China faster than you can say “supply chain.” Why pay Americans when you can get sweatshops for pennies? Then they lecture you about “upskilling” while they automate your job with AI they own. Gig economy? Their brainchild. You’re not an employee, you’re a “contractor”—no benefits, no security, just you and your five-star Uber rating, praying for tips to afford rent in a city they’ve gentrified into a playground for their trust-fund spawn.
And let’s talk real estate, because why not twist the knife? They’ve turned homes into poker chips—BlackRock’s out here buying entire neighborhoods, jacking up prices so you’ll never own anything but a TikTok account. Rent’s through the roof, mortgages are a fantasy, and they’re AirBnB-ing your dreams into their portfolios. You’re one missed paycheck from couch-surfing, while they’re flipping their fifth vacation home in Aspen.
The kicker? They’ve got the nerve to call you lazy. “Pull yourself up by your bootstraps!” they scream from their private jets, as if you’re not already working three jobs just to afford Wi-Fi to hear their TED Talks about mindfulness. They’ve gutted the middle class, turned opportunity into a punchline, and convinced half the country it’s their fault for not being born with a silver spoon.
So yeah, the upper class didn’t just screw the economy—they threw it in a blender, hit puree, and sold the smoothie for a profit. And the worst part? They’re still out there, toasting their “success” with champagne you paid for, while you’re Googling “how to live in a van.” Welcome to America, baby—land of the free, home of the fleeced!",0,1744494941.0,TimDillon,0,0.29,False

I have been tracking my extractions as well and using 1.5 week old beans bought from a local roaster grinded with the  K6 for reference.

This shot was 15.5g and pulled in 33s for about 34g, is that the ideal shot? If so is the taste of an espresso is slightly sour. Is there any other parameters I should be looking at to improve or what the ideal taste is meant to be like.

I'm tempted to go to a local coffee shop to compare but I previously never drank espresso shots but purely liked white mochas so thats the end goal.",1,1744494928.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Never had a friend who I can call beat friend for life but I have lots of friend throughout my college and school life. I also meets my colony friends in significant intervals but my hobbies are mostly different from all of friends. 

But the feeling of being alone never stuck me I regularly hit the gym all alone, did lots of solo travelling also been lost in a forest reserve area lol but that’s a story for some other day. 

But let’s talk about today I completed my left over work and just want to enjoy the weather today as Delhi is drooling with moisturise winds so I call one of friend he was busy with work, I don’t like to get another rejection beforehand so I got my bike left from home and riding enjoying the winds. 

So after some hustle through traffic I had decided to enjoy a cup of coffee by myself and oh boy oh boy I was feeling so lonely in the moment like WTF I need someone to talk to in the moment. I never had this feeling before and I tell you I am kind of guy who been to solo movie dates, explore cafe alone as well walk across the whole Manali just for the vibes but I think once we get older the feeling of being alone start devouring you. 


It’s just 20s or just a single child thing I don’t know man, been to many dates as well but never found the right one in life. I am already 27 now my life peaked in mid 20s let’s just say I did everything possible that money offers and been to lots of trip as an avid adventure I enjoy every bit of it. But I really think I lost purpose of life, can anyone help me to explain the phenomena like it’s just ageing or just human psychology of being left out?",2,1744494812.0,TwentiesIndia,1,1.0,False

* How is the gigging community/outlook in the area? Everything from bands playing shows to working gigs (breweries, coffee shop sets, local theatre stuff, events, etc.)
* What combination (if any) of work have you found best suits you here? I mainly split my time between gigs and teaching (Percussion/Drums, Guitar, and Piano), along with some remote tracking and mixing work. Hoping to continue on that path as I build up some projects.
* What is the general temperature of the scene? Everything from the vibe of the community to the genres that are most supported.
* Any other experience, insight, encouragement or warnings you'd like to give!

1jxsd3o,https://i.redd.it/38dw45o86hue1.png,Echo 1055 4x4 25-26 Lease Takeover,"I'm looking for someone to take over my lease starting in August 2025.

The apartment is in Echo 1055 on the corner of Tropicana and Wilbur across from the Dayton dorms. It is no more than a 5 minute walk to the student wellness center, a 10 minute walk to the student union, and about a 20 minute walk to the other side of campus. It is located right next to the Vons plaza.

Amenities include a gym, study rooms, a game room, free coffee, a pool and grill area, and a zen garden. The rooms come fully furnished with a full XL bed, a desk, two sets of drawers, and a wardrobe. Every unit comes with a washer/dryer, a full kitchen, and heating and cooling.

They allow pets. The limit is 1 dog or cat no more than 100lbs and you would have to pay a fee and monthly payment. They also have parking for $50 a month.

The move in date is at the end of August before the Fall semester starts and the lease lasts until July 31, 2026.

The rent is either $850 + utilities or $890 + utilities depending on if you choose a standard or master bedroom respectively. I personally have never paid more than $1000 a month for everything, and usually pay under $950. The lease is signed for a master but the manager is willing to change to a standard.

It is one full bedroom and bathroom in an apartment of four, and three other roommates. Everyone shares a common area and kitchen.

I am willing to negotiate helping with payments for the first two months. Any gender can sign for it given the unit has yet to be assigned.

For any questions, more details, or to request to take the lease over, please let me know.

At the top are the rooms to choose from. The standard has a detached bathroom while the master has a connected one.

Yesterday I went to YouTube to see what would be suggested. This vlog guys… was almost impossible to listen to.

There was no substance, nothing to listen to, no talking about what we’re seeing LOL it just made it impossible to listen to! She must think people “WATCH-watch” her… Does that make sense?

She talked about a shirt, no descriptions. She talked about makeup. No description again… no “brick red, flat, matte” “oh it’s creasing in the corner of my eye”. I had to pick something else to listen to. 

I struggle with believing the rest of her long format content is watchable, except for those obsessed with looking at her, which is…. One thing to cater to. Seems like a lot of b-roll and feeding into the idea that people might like looking at her or living her day with her.

1jxsb09,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jxsb09/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_me_how_do_i/,I think there is something wrong with me. How do I fix it?,"Ok, here's background information: I'm 23. I graduated college a few months ago. I was lucky enough to land a really good job, and I feel like I'm doing well. My coworkers seem to like me and I've gotten official and unofficial recognition for doing good work. I have a girlfriend of a couple years, and one close best friend and lots of other friends from college. I have a good relationship with my family. I admittedly haven't been in the gym much lately, but I lifted fairly regularly and ran some in the past. 

All of that is to say that, on the surface, I feel like I'm doing alright. Average, at least. The problem is that I feel like there's something inherently wrong with me, and I have my whole life. I feel like I get targeted constantly and I have horrible luck. I know that sounds completely irrational. It's not all bad stuff. I've been told I have a really trustworthy face. People chat with me in lines, out on the street, on public transit, etc. and I'm great at customer service. But it also feels like I get targeted with bad behavior too. I used to live in a slightly sketchy area, and someone would hassle me for change or scream at me on the street or pace around muttering about about how they want to hurt me constantly at train stations or out on the street. I also generally have bad luck--sometimes it feels like whenever bad things are likely to happen, they always happen to me in particular. I'm also a generally sound-sensitive person and have noise-cancelling earbuds in often if I'm out on the street or sidewalk, but usually I leave them off if I'm feeling anxious about being bothered. 

This weekend has kind of been a breaking point for me. Today I decided I wanted to take my laptop and journal to a coffee shop to grab a nice coffee and do some reading and journaling. It's something I did fairly often in college and enjoyed. I was feeling really nervous about being out with a backpack and my laptop, so I decided to walk through the park first. At first, it was nice--it's a gorgeous day, the birds have come back for spring, and everyone was out with their dogs just enjoying themselves. And then two dickhead teenagers were coming down the (wide, multi-use) path towards me, and one of them deliberately switched sides to fly by as close to me as possible and the other one laughed. He almost hit me. 

It really got to me for some reason. It's like I had hoped going to the park would help me get a grip, touch some grass, feel normal again and enjoy my life, but instead it just proved that actually, there is something wrong with me and people will target me and bad things will in fact happen to me all the time if I leave my house or do anything at all. First I felt angry and thought that I hope he crashes his scooter, and then I felt guilty because I don't actually want anybody to get hurt ever. I ended up sitting on a bench and just feeling worse and worse and worse until I gave up and decided to just go home. I've been a total disaster ever since. 

TLDR I have horrible luck and people bother me constantly. Bad things happen to me all the time. 

How do I fix this? How do I fix whatever's wrong with me and stop being the target every single time? I'm stuck with me and whatever's wrong with me for life, so I want to fix it. ",1,1744494482.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

My main hobbies are gym and active lifestyle related. I’ve been going to the gym for over 6 years and am also into running - plan on running the 1/2 marathon here in the fall. I’m also into other things like walking, hikes, rec sports, nutrition, the outdoors, etc. As much as I am into physical activity and fitness, I also enjoy other things like new coffee shops, live music, good food, good conversation and down to go out the odd time. I still hold the gym and fitness as more of a priority. 

I’m making this post as I’d love to meet some like minded people. So if you’re into similar hobbies, want to hit a lift, get coffee, go on a walk, share goals or anything shoot me a dm! It’d be nice to find some like minded people.

1jxs94l,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jxs94l/i_23_m_fell_in_love_with_a_girl_23_f_from_another/,I (23 M) fell in love with a girl (23 F) from another country,"This can most definitely fall into different subreddits, but here we are.

The beginning of this story is truly where everything went wrong….

In a lonely Halloween night of 2023, I (23 M) was exploring Insta and looking at programming content (I was into programming and etc)

One my people to follow page this profile popped up and it was this beautiful girl (23 F) 

Her bio was different, you could tell she was a real person. So I messaged her and was thinking nothing of it, deleted the chat because I’m stupid, why would that even go through to someone.

Surprise by me, later that night she messages back and we have hours long conversation. Slowly over the next few weeks we talk every day and become friends like instantly.

One day we video called…
My job is also tech related, and because is into programming she understands it. I said “I could probably explain this concept in a call to you and you would understand it without any context compared to my coworkers who’ve I’ve explained it to already 2 times before” and she takes that as a ‘okay let’s call’ and we do, spend about 3 hours (we both remotely, respectively at home) so we do and we just sit on the call while working. I realized when we ended the call that I just fell so hard for her.

Over the next weeks we talk and talk and one night we joke. And again… I fucked up. She was a little drunk and she joked about telling people fuck off. I say ‘but not me right’, and she says ‘no not you, instead I would ask you to fuck me’ and I was taken a bit by this (previous to this, I’ve never had anyone say or talk to me like this) and we basically ‘joke around’ over the next couple of minutes, more like an hour. And joke around about calling each other baby and babe. 

The next morning…. Things keep going like this. I was kinda into it but I was like okay what is going on, we are not together this should not be happening. I ask her if she wants to be together but because of living in different countries and afraid of things, she said no. I told her then we should stop saying this stuff. Then the following day she admits she cannot do it anymore, she wants to keep saying this nonsense and calling me babe. But the caveat - She doesn’t wanna be together. 

Over the next few nights we talk about this. And we talk about like the possibilities and she doesn’t want to commit to a relationship but wants to use me, emotionally that is. One night I call BS and I say it’s either we are together or we just gotta go back to being friends, and friendship doesn’t work, then we gotta call quits.

She actually agrees and from this moment we are together. To give perspective, we started talking on Halloween, started our relationship mid December.

We call every night, fall asleep on calls and we are perfect, at least I thought we were, and we were planning for me to fly down to her later in March.

2 months go by, she then goes on a vacation with her family, but something changed. She stopped calling me babe. She got busy with work (I understand) but she got increasingly agitated with everyone, including me. Before you guess anything, no - nothing happened with her on this vacation. She actually had to work so she was even more stressed along with being around her family. She hated her family a lot during this vacation and it made things not so great to talk to her. 

But fun fact - her sister found out she was talking to me and she was afraid of this (later on in this story, you will find this funny). She is in fact - embarrassed that she was talking to me so she didn’t want her family to find out because culturally she did not think they would approve. 

But anyways, she gets done this vacation. She goes back to her apartment. She is a little distant. I try to ask her what’s wrong, then she kinda flips out at me a little bit (taking out the frustration that her family caused her), then admits that she wants to break up. I asked why and she said the same reason why she was so hesitant for getting into the relationship in the first place. Because she ‘lost feelings’, but she wants to be friends still.

I fucked up by staying friends. It was hard. It was really hard. I wanted to say how I felt, how sad I was, but I couldn’t. I didn’t wanna eat, I actually lost 5 pounds because of this. Then I got back on my feet and focused on work.

3 weeks go by, it still sucks and she asks what’s wrong one night and I kinda slip my thoughts and I say I miss calling and talking to her everyday and she does too…. So another fuckup is we call. It is really weird. Weird as can be. We don’t call again, until she asks to. I was playing some games and was halfway focused but halfway not. But during this time, she spilled a secret that she has had a hard time sleeping for while. Before she met me, and then I kinda fixed her lol, and she slept peacefully at night. Then when we didn’t call, she would have to take medication to sleep and it did not help much. And so she wanted to go through this stage of us calling again. And I advised that is not a good idea, but I fucked up because I wanted it so badly that we do it.

And over the next months we are not together but acting like it. Friends with emotional benefits.

However things start to get complicated when she has to move in with her sister. Her sister finds out that we have been talking and so the secret about me comes out, not about us being together or what not but who I was, and what no. And surprise, her sister likes that we are talking because the girl is happy. Oh and better yet, the girl allows her sister to know my voice, sends audio notes of her sister saying stuff about me/to me, and her sister creates a nickname for me. One night I even got to talk to her mom. Obviously I can’t talk directly, the girl has to translate.

Oh and then one day we decided to call basically for 48 hours straight, went on a virtual mall date (we went to the mall in our respective countries and got food, basically a date but totally weird), and then my family comes back to the house and my mom barges into my room even though I’m an adult and catches her on video, just us talking, nothing bad but this sparks my family drama. 
(I live at home with my family but I also don’t tell my family anything about my social life, they always have made a big deal over nothing and embarrass me, so I just isolated myself from them)

So even though we aren’t together at this point, we are closer than when we were actually together AND our families both know and think we are together. 

While this is happening, the girl’s sister is talking about a trip to Europe, and I ‘jokingly’ am invited. What do I mean by this? They decided to be like ‘Oh hey have ‘my name’ come with us to Europe, it would be so much fun’, ‘Oh I trust him to be alone with you, even in different country’. 

At first it was a laugh from me, but I was like this is an interesting opportunity, because not only have I never travelled. But I wanted to go to this place in Europe that is in the area they were traveling, and money is not an object for me in this case, nor is time off. So I think and think and actually I talk to the girl about making it real and we talk about it, and at this point I think this is going to happen.

As we approach one month from the trip, the girl told me she is going to get extremely busy with her work and other hobbies, trying to prepare for the trip. The trip for them will be a month, so work wise she had to ensure the people who were covering her knew the system and the code and etc, and she said expect her not to respond except to like critical things. So yes… that happened. But she stopped calling too. She was busy but she just totally distanced herself. All the while I’m trying to figure out the plans for the trip.

She posts on her story that she bought her plane ticket, then texts me all excitedly. Then gives me like all the details, including the airport and dates and times. And we text and I plan out my flight and etc and she is on board but she has to tell her sister which she hasn’t done, and she said don’t buy them until she does….

A week and a half goes by. I try to get her to talk but she is distanced. I get somewhat drunk and my friend earlier that day (unrelated to this) told me that I make plans but I always back out of them, and I wanted to prove them wrong so out of spite I bough the ticket to Europe, and I tell the girl.

She is UPSET with me, like very much so and she flips out at me for doing this, despite hanging this trip over my head and saying sure sure, then saying no. She wants me to cancel but I say flat out no. She hates me for this, but then says okay and starts laying ground rules for this trip. 4 main rules:
1: She won’t spend a lot of time with me
2: She won’t change her plans
3: We won’t stay at the same place/same room
4: No extra physical contact.

Okay so we both agree and I start to plan my plans because again I wanted to go regardless for this other thing I wanted to do.

Then she said she is going to tell her sister. Okay a few days go by and I ask and she said she didn’t. I asked what the plan was and she flipped out on me stating no, she is not going to meet me, she has no intentions, her sister is mad at me too and all of this extra things she was not telling me / communicating that I have been annoying her and she hates how I am acting. 

At this point I just say it is what it is and focus on my plans. I am still going, I already have in my mind that I wanted to do this for myself anyways. I already told my work for time off, my family and other friends. I was NOT backing out.

So the day comes to leave. I have my hotel already booked, a rental car in place for when I got there, and everything set to go. I text her safe travels. She actually texts back saying same to you and then tells me she is at the airport and was got to talk to the pilots and send me a video of it. I also said I packed a sweater for her (she wanted this sweater way back…) and she asked if I really thought we were gonna meet up and I was like ‘well that’s up to you, but you clearly have made it clear no’

Anyways…. Fast forward to Europe. I got off the plane. My original flight plan was changed so I arrived later than I was supposed to. Either way, I was just going to get my stuff and go to my hotel. 

LITLTE DID I KNOW this was not going to be that simple. Everything changed in an instant.

Here are the events that went down:
Day 1:
I get my baggage, and I walk down the airport to find the rental car pickup for paperwork and etc. 
As I am I’m keeping my eyes open, new place, don’t want to get caught looking like I have no clue where I’m going since I’m alone, in another country. I’m walking I see these 2 girls in black, and I’m thinking it could be the girl and her sister but I brush off that thought. I start to keep walking, but then at I do, the girl turns out at that exact moment like she was waiting for me and sees me. She turns back to her sister, then turns back to me and starts to walk towards me. I - in shock am like omg what is happening.
She gets up to me and we hug and say hi and what not. She then explains why they are still there (they are having issues with getting their rental car) and she offers to walk me over to mine (which it is conveniently located the next spot over)

Now I am shaking, very much so in shock that I just met her. Okay so I finish my paperwork fast since I already did majority of it online beforehand, and I get my keys to the car. She starts to walk back over towards me and explains they are still having troubles, but she takes me over to where they are sitting. I explain what I did and like etc. we start to have a simple conversation and then she wants to get something to eat so we walk to one of the stores and she tries to use the card (the reason why they were having troubles). Doing this seems so….. right? Like it felt like this is what we were supposed to do in the beginning, in felt so natural - being with her that is.

Okay so we go sit back down and I then meet her sister and her sister’s fiancé. They are not mad at me being there, they are more stressed about not being able to get to the rental car paperwork to process. Her sister doesn’t speak good English, so it was slightly difficult but it was okay with the girl and guy. Okay well it was really good though. Also that sweater I mentioned… I gave it to her (good thing I brought it - more of this later)

I am being a good person and I offer them solutions to their problems. At the end of they got rental car. So we all walk to the garage, engage in the conversations, and we all say goodbye as I get off the elevator. I go to my car and it is an suv , not one I’m familiar with so I start adjusting everything and then try to figure out where my hotel is and where to go. All of a sudden I see the girl walking around looking for me. I get out and she says they still might need my help. They got their paperwork done but wasn’t sure when the next rental car would be available that wasn’t electric. So I offered a ride for them to their hotel. They got all of their stuff in my car and I start down the garage, just for them to get a phone call to say they actually have a rental car now, so I have to drive back up the garage (I’m not used to the signs so I may have driven up the wrong way, but it’s totally okay) and then get there. Then help them with their stuff, and then we all say goodbye again. The girl lets me get some hotspot before they leave so I can google my hotel address LOL. Me and her hug a little longer than expected, and we say goodbye. St this point I’m expecting that will be the last time I see her.

I finally leave, get to my hotel…. Hard to sleep that’s for sure. She ends up texting me around 3ish am (I wake up to this text) and she’s asking all about how I was doing and etc. I ask her but she’s not wanting to talk about it because she’s tired (that’s typical for her to do). 

Day 2: 
The next day I just plan to catch up on sleep. Around 1ish I get a text from her asking if I had lunch yet. The reason why? She wants to go to lunch and asks me to come pick her up.

To be honest - I had no plans. I did not come up with any plans besides what I wanted to do which would not happen until the weekend (It was Monday)

So I said sure, and I went and picked her up. One big caveat - she has a phobia of pigeons. Some will say really? And yes - I have seen it so I can say it’s a real thing. So I have to meet her inside a store and walk her out to the car. It felt surreal because this is what we talked about doing in the beginning but she had shut that down so many times, but to have to happen… it’s funny.

We go get lunch (we get McDonald’s lol since that’s what she wanted), and then we drive around for a little bit. She wants to explore so we go to this random town and explore it. It was hot and humid so not ideal but it was fun anyways. And she leaned into me protecting her from pigeons. So much so she kept grabbing my arm or holding my arm because she was scared.

We walk around some more and decided that’s enough and she’s tired, so she wants to go back to her hotel. We get in the car and my brother wants to call… and she wanted to talk so I video called. The huge part to take out of this is she told them I was only a friend. Okay, so I drive her back, she falls asleep in the car for about 15 minutes. We get to her hotel. She wants for me to walk her to the doorway. We end up having to take some slight detours due to pigeons. Anyways…. During the walk we talk and etc. and it’s weird… I’m trying to hide it but I am overly happy that I get to be with her in this moment of time. 

We arrive at the hotel door and she hugs and says goodbye. I walk back to my car. It is slightly past 6pm, I need to try to find something to eat for dinner soon. Then she texts asking if I left yet. She wants to come back out with me. So we meet back up, go to my car. At this point I had to go back to my hotel for my phone charger AND I had to change from being filled with sweat from walking around all day in the hot. So we make a stop at my hotel, and go up to my room. I know what y’all are thinking… no. But I forget my other stuff so I leave her in my room while I go grab my stuff. I come back and she made herself comfy, watching the tv (the Olympics). We talk and she asks for water. I pour her a glass and myself one too. But she drinks from mine and I laugh, because it’s funny. I say ‘you know we have been sharing our water all day, that should be illegal’ and she said ‘Yeah, it is but oh well’ - meaning she wanted it like this.

Okay so we talk a little and then just kinda watch the games. Then she gets a little sleepy and (my room has 2 beds, pushed together), she she goes on the 2nd bed and then looks at me and falls asleep next to me for about 30 minutes. I am freaking out inside, because I did not know this was going to happen. Okay she then wakes up and says she should probably go back, it’s like close to midnight so it’s okay. I drive her back and we hug in the car and we say goodbye as if it could be the last time because I thought it might.

I drive back to my hotel and that’s the end of the day. 

Day 3: Day of relaxing. She goes to a concert with her sister. At the concert, she sends a message of her sister then translates it to me, stating they would love for me to join them odor a day until I go do what I’m going to do, so this happens on Friday. 


Day 5: she invites me to come to the shopping center with her and her sister. I go. I got to see what a girl shopping for clothes is like. I got to be there for her, I also got to have some funny moments with her sister - trying on sunglasses.

Anyways, the girl wants to go outside and get away from her sister. We do, then after we go and she wants coffee, but have to get to her hotel first. So we do, then her sister needs a ride to the supermarket so we wait for her. And then I drive them and then me and the girl take a drive to go get coffee. We go to this place near my hotel. I buy her coffee and myself a water and we sit in the car, in the parking lot for 2 hours. Just talking. And then I want to find something to eat but it’s getting late. So here we are, going back to my hotel since they do have a place to eat. But I don’t even eat. Instead we go back to my room, and we lay down on the beds and we talk more. And then she talks about the concert and shows me the videos. She was annoyed with her sister and etc. 

We do and then I notice a scar on her shoulder, and she explains oh yeah that is normal. Then I am like yeah you remember my scars on my stomach yeah? And I show her then she pitched my stomach lol. Like yo not cool. Then she lets me grab her stomach like um okay? But okay we go back to talking and then I stray my fingers through her hair and she doesn’t stop me, but then her sister does call her and says she needs to get back. So I have to drive her back. On the way there, I ask her if she feels anything for me. Then she was like no, nothing more than friends (the actions don’t line up with this but okay). And then we get there and we hug in the car again and then say our final final goodbye… for now,


Day 7: I get done my activity I really went there for. I don’t have any other plans. And now, we have to meet up again. Not only because she left her purse in my car, but because her sister and her made the offer for me to meet up in the other country with them, and stay with them.

Day 8: I drive 8 hours to meet up with them, in this town that is amazing. I was the one to book the Airbnb, this small town close by. But we walked around this place together, took pictures, and even bought groceries together as a family, or what for felt like it. We go back to the cars, and the girl decided to ride with me to the Airbnb. 

We get there, we’ll all unpack. Me and her share the room with 2 beds, while her sister and her sister’s fiancé use the layout bed couch. We all sleep, peacefully.

(Take note - 3 out of her 4 rules SHE broke)

Day 9: 
Me and her take a trip into town to do laundry, and get lunch, and we take a drive around. And she didn’t want to be at the Airbnb, but on the drive she slept.

We got back to the Airbnb, we then both sleep lol.

We wake up, and we all have dinner. Then me and her take a midnight walk, done the street. And we just kinda have a good walk, then find a stray cat and we sit down with the cat and we chill. Then she tries teaching me some French accents because I am not so great at it, but oh well. It is romantic but we don’t make it as such, but we head back before it gets too late.

Day 10:
We go to visit a mountain together. We then go on the train up the mountain. Me and her sit together across from her sister.

We get to the mountain, walk around, and take pictures… and take pictures together. We had an insane amount of fun. On the way down the mountain on the train, we take pictures together as well. We then all have dinner at this restaurant. We wait for a ride back down to our car, I cry about something and she holds me and lets me cry. First time crying in public…

We get back to the car and we put on music and we all start singing songs together the whole way back to the Airbnb. Well all sleep

Day 11: 
We leave town to go to this other town. She rides with me, and we split from her sister. We spend the whole day together, we go to this town with an amazing river, and we get lunch. She was really picky, so we had Hooters (yes, hooters in Europe). We then walked throughout the town, and she was holding my arm at times because the pigeons. We this book this other Airbnb in a separate town. We drive, go to a store and get some food, and she wears my brand new sweater I bought, and she looked really cute in it.

We get to the Airbnb, and set up a surprise for her sister with wine and it was a good night. We then played Uno - it was me and her and it was funny. It was amazing playing and the last game I got totally slammed with Draw 4s. We end the night. At this point, we are all sleeping in the same room. Her sister and fiancé take the big bed, she lets me have the side bed, and she sleeps on the floor (after much insisting on her part, I tried to get her sleep on the bed and I take the floor or even the couch)

Day 12:
We spend the morning sleeping - we get up and have brunch. We then all go to this little park, and we walk. The girl is not feeling that great, her sister made her super annoyed and she just wanted to be alone. We all let her be.

Then it’s come to an end, and they want to make their way back to the car, so they ask me if she is okay and to let her know we are leaving. They are pretty much acting like we were together, because well at that point it is looking like it.

We go back to the Airbnb where her sister goes to get ready to go to the store. Me and her are tryna go do something else, but she is not in a great mood and feeling sick. I have to let the sister inside the Airbnb since I have the keys. Her sister gets some of her medicine and gives it to me - to give to her. Again - I’m taking care of her, not friend like but as if I’m with her….

Her sister leaves and me and her just talk, then she kinda talks about how the trip is ruined and etc, and she doesn’t want to go home. And then I start to kinda cry for like no reason, but like she wanted to go inside so we did. We went inside, I cried a bit more, she was feeling a little better and made coffee and ate some Nutella and crackers. 

We then just kinda chill on the couch together, we give each other back massages, and at some point I was laying on her stomach until she wanted more crackers. I lay on the couch still and then she says:
‘I bet I can make you mad’
I was like bet you can’t
She goes slaps my butt
Then she is like you mad? I just started laughing at this point. Then she decide to take it a step further and grab my cheeks. 
(She breaks her rule of no extra physical contact)

I am still kinda laughing, and she goes to the counter and drinks some coffee and giggling

I go up to her and say:
Your allowed to do that? Okay I guess I am allowed to and I grab her cheek. She is like:
‘Hey noooo that is not allowed’ and giggles, but she doesn’t do anything else. We just kinda go back to normal. Then her sister calls and says they are on the way back, so we have to clean the place up.

We do and then we all have dinner. It is my last night with them, before I have leave to go home.

She then pays me back for the Airbnb expenses and etc.

I ask her to go for a walk, then we did. The walk was midnight walk again, and it was quite cool out, and it was wonderful sights outside, as we were by a river.

We walk and then she starts to lock her arm with mine, I was not expecting this and we just acted like it was totally normal. We then get to a point where we start walking back. But we find a bench to sit down.

We sit and then we legit were just there, then she reached her arm around me and we leaned on me. Then I did the same, and we just were there and we were holding hands the whole time. Literally straight out of a romantic scene from a movie.

It was getting late and her sister texted asking where we were, because it was late and they knew I had to leave in the morning.

We walk back, locking arms and get to the Airbnb. I ask her to kiss, and she kinda brushes it off and says ‘you know why’

We got back, and got ready for bed. I couldn’t sleep, she was still up. I tried to talk to her about the events that just unfolded and she didn’t want to, kinda was like it is late, I need to go to bed, end of discussion. So I did.

Day 13: Final Day
I wake up, get packed, and all set to leave. I don’t leave yet. I could have but I didn’t. I did want to do one thing before I left Europe but it was going to cut it too close because traffic, so I just didn’t.

So I ate breakfast, and accidentally woke her sister up. She noticed I was getting ready to leave. The fiancé also woke up, and they were getting breakfast.

The sister says the girl is still sleeping but I can try to wake her up and say goodbye.

So I do - I lay down next to her on the flood, and I wake her up. I play with her hair and say I’m going to leave soon, and she is like okay, goodbye. But then she starts to get up, so I wait for her. She eats and etc and we all just kinda talk and say goodbyes. 

Then she says it’s custom for them to walk the guest to the door, but she walks me out of the Airbnb. We just stand outside together. I did not want to let go of her, I could see that she didn’t want to either, based on the her body language. She would never admit it though.

We do one last long hug, then before I let go of her hand, I kissed her hand (why? I don’t know. I never would have seen myself do this but I did)

Then that was my goodbye. I go to my car, start inputting the airport in the gps. She then runs up to the car, and is like ‘wait - I have to make sure I didn’t forget anything this time’ 
We check the car, there is nothing there, then we say goodbyes again, but this time she takes my hand and kisses it…. 

She goes inside then texts 
‘Goodbye friend, see you next time’

I am on the road. And from there… I go to the airport, and return home. 

She stays in Europe for 2 more weeks. This one night we called and slept on the phone, but she made me hang up because she didn’t want her sister to see we were doing so.

Everything is okay. She then returns home. We are okay, talking, and discussing about calling.

I of course go to Canada this night as well as I live close by the border. I return home, she is already sleeping. She then becomes distant from me. The next few weeks becomes very… very distant.

I understand she took on a lot of work when she got back because things had to get done. But she kinda ghosted me for a few weeks, maybe sending a meme or two, but not looking or responding to my messages.

Mid December came around, and I confront her about this. She says ‘it’s best for us’ and I kinda loose it, and I go in a tangent how i understand but the way she went about doing so was wrong.

Then I decide that I need to have some space. The best thing for ‘us’ was me blocking her. So I did. 3ish weeks went by and around new years I had some drinks, and I unblocked her… I wanted to say something but I didn’t. And I left her unblocked.

She then sends me a reel  a few days later… and I say I’m surprised. And then we discuss being friends again, and again surprise - that’s what she wants.

We then keep a okay friendship for 2 months, but she is still distant and like only tells me things when it’s convenient.

I get the sense that she still feels / cares about me a little bit, but she’s guarding herself.

Enter: my closest, over a decade longtime friend who knows everything.

He decides one day to cause chaos and messages her and me the same thing… it was kinda bad.

But then the day after, he decides it’s not enough and puts us all in a group chat. And this get interesting. I say it’s a bad idea, but the girl goes along with it. And it’s fun, and funny, but also interesting. She shares some things with me that could be in our dm but in the gc…. 

And my friend… he and I were joking around with nicknames and he pulled some sick joke and named me as ‘name -> crush -> name’ and then I was like yo nah that’s crazy, and I change it back. But it’s under updates, so the girl definitely sees this….

We then continue on like nothing happened. A few days later we then have a discussion about my hand writing and etc. 

To my surprise, the girl tells her sister about my handwriting - and sends an audio of her sister and translates it to us…. Yeah it’s hella weird. And then we talk a little about the nickname I have, her sister still calls me it. And it’s weird because her sister…. Should not still be talking about me with her. Reflecting upon this - meaning she still cares and have some type of feelings towards me but denies it, most likely because the distance.

So that is where we are, a year and a half later after we met on a one-off dm on insta. I can’t get a read on her and I am still into her. 

I know I should probably just say to her to be honest and either let’s go all it or if that’s not what she wants to drop this all and exit each other’s life’s for good. 

TL;DR - I sent a random girl a message on insta, she turned out to be from another country, we date, we split. We meet up in a different country in a trip with her family. We stop talking. We are now talking in a group chat with my closest friend, and it is chaotic. I should probably just forget her, but I’m still into her. ",0,1744494328.0,stories,0,0.5,False

I don't know how exciting this will be to read but I’ve had the best experience so far with a bbw I met off Tinder. 

My wife is in shape and beautiful but we don't have much sexual chemistry so I wanted to see if I could have any luck finding someone on tinder. It took probably 6 months before a woman, we will call her Nat, was willing to look past my marriage and see what happens. 

Nat is a beautiful latina woman. Brunette, large breasts, plus sized waist and natural sex appeal.  She was looking for long term but we had enough chemistry in the chat we got a coffee a few times before we decided we wanted to move forward. 

We both wanted to get in better shape and she had a gym in her apt building so we wanted to do a workout each time before we hungout. The first time it was like we were both back in college. Flirting, touching each other and helping each other spot. After an hour the plan was that we would want to wash up in her place and then hang out. The first time we got back into her apt, we couldn't wait. We made out the 2nd the door closed and we had our clothes off in about 30 seconds and raced to her bed. 

She was so fucking sexy standing in her room, naked. Her breasts out, he wavy hair coming down just above her nipples. I ran my hands all over her body before I pushed her on the bed. 

I wanted to eat her pussy so badly, I went right for it. She had shaved for me and was so fucking smooth. The workout had just a hint of sweat and her pussy was fucking drenched. I hurried my face in her pussy for 10 minutes trying to get her to cum. She buried my face farther in her fat pussy. I loved it. When she brought me up for air, she put a condom on me and told me to fuck her. 

We fucked for at least an hour. She rode me like a pro, for a big girl she could slide on a dick with ease. We had such good chemistry right away it was like we had been doing this for awhile. 

When i got close, she ripped the condom off and gave me head that my wife could only dream of. She ended up letting me cum on her face while giving me such a sexy stare. 

Since then, we have been fucking at least once a week for a year. It has been some of the best sex of my life and I never want it to end. ",0,1744494276.0,cheating_stories,5,0.38,False

Admittedly, one of my stress responses is going into Reddit/YouTube rabbit holes. I'm in a very busy period of life (work is super busy and I'm in the last few weeks of my semester for another graduate program not related to my 9-5 in psychology), so I literally only have 10 minute breaks randomly throughout the day. The randomness and time limitations are not conducive to calling up a friend, going out for a quick coffee, and so I check out posts...And, well, this whole Michel/Jordy saga got my attention as a former viewer/real life therapist. There really are a lot of real life lessons to learn.  
  
I just took said mini-break and Jordy just responded (again...) to something I wrote (just in the last few minutes to some of my YouTube comments on the last podcast video). I will say, he's exchanged vitriol for passive aggressiveness, so maybe an improvement? Probably not. Curious what others' takes on his latest comments are. I will say I think it's interesting that he called me out for my comments here and on YouTube; is that a compliment, haha?:)

But, I also wondered if any of you can relate to using these forums for quick breaks and the burn out it can cause. I preach balance, but I know I've been relying a bit too heavily on it. I'm all for snark when done in a playful manner and when it stimulates good discussion/application to real life, but I think I need to be called out for my over utilization. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you balance fun/playful snark with negative/rabbit hole (and feel free to call me out! I try not to be a Michel/Jordy and call ""hater"" on perspectives that can make me grow - also, I'm a therapist and we tend to have very thick skins :)",3,1744494233.0,micheljanseYT,0,1.0,False

I was diagnosed with PCOS at 15 and since I was having really bad cystic acne and it was ruining my confidence in high school my doctor (of course) recommended the pill! So I started taking the Diane pill and it was great for my acne but I gained so much weight and I had a constant terrible mood, so in senior year of high school I made the decision to quit the pill and I went to see a naturopath. 
The naturopath was actually great and helped me mainly to regulate my diet after quitting the pill, he gave me a completely Whole Foods diet and kind of keto (lots of healthy fats but low in simple carbs) but most importantly he made me quit completely diary which I already knew I was intolerant to but kept eating with digestive enzymes. 

During that summer at the end of my high school senior year thanks to that diet and quitting the pill I lost a lot of weight and my acne was almost gone. Then my first year of uni came and with it eating out constantly, drinking a lot, and of course a lot of anxiety. My cystic acne came back in full force but I honestly wanted an easy way out so I went back on the Diane pill. Worst decision of my life.
I gained all the weight back and my skin wasn’t even clearing up that much, so nearing summer of that year I stopped it again and went back to a clean and completely keto diet. This time my body has a really hard time losing the weight and regulating so I made the decision to stop the pill forever and with my dermatologist we decided to try accutane for my at the point sever cystic acne.

Accutane was honestly hell but after 1 cycle I had the best skin of my life for 2 full years if not more. Than my acne came back with a vengeance but in those years I had decided to never get back to the pill so I started accepting it until last year when I had a particularly bad period with my life and my acne flared up so so bad and all my pcos symptoms with it, my hair face “beard” ecc 
So I made another terrible decision to go back on accutane and it healed my skin for just six months than the acne came back again more cystic and painful than ever!!

So we arrived to this year, I started researching by myself because I was determined to help my body balance the hormones without accutane or the pill. 
The changes that I made are mainly diet and lifestyle, I don’t take supplements of any kind because I always had bad experiences with every kind. 

DIET 

From the first day of my cycle to the day my lutheal
Phase starts I do fasting of max 15 hrs and a mostly keto diet, every day I start my day with a breakfast of at least 30 grams of protein and my diet is of clean ingredients and Whole Foods (with the occasional processed foods of course)

On my lutheal phase my body craves carbs so I prioritize complex carbs and I don’t deny my body to give it stress
 
I keep my alcol intake pretty low and prefer to go
For a dry drink like a gin soda or tequila soda, beer and wine I tend to avoid 

No alcol one week before my menstrual phase 

I pretty much don’t eat dairy of any kind and try to have vegetables with every meal

I also try to make my own ginger shots or green juice ( not really a fan of green powders )

Every meal is heavily protein focused 

Coffee never as first thing in the morning and I try to have just one a day 

Spearmint tea every day 
Dandelion tea every day 

LIFESTYLE 

most important thing that I’ve done for myself is prioritize good sleep, honestly changed the way my day goes and lowered my anxiety 

The thing that mostly gave me anxiety was my work so I made the promise to myself to close my laptop
After 6.30 pm and not think about it anymore until the next day

Exercise everyday and walks everyday (if possible
With sunshine!!) 

Try to have a slower kind of exercise on the lutheal phase (high intensity workouts will give my body more stress)

SKINCARE 
With skincare I have a completely acne safe and fungal acne safe routine and I do skincycling too to
Try fading my acne scars 

This is pretty much it! No supplements! As I said not a fan of them 

Right now this is what is working for me, my acne is really mild my mustache is tiny and my menstrual cramps have lowered so much 

I also keep a food and symptoms diary to help myself track my body better 

Hope this helps :) (sorry English is not my first language)

1jxs6xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jxs6xp/why_am_i29m_feel_this_way_about_a_guy_while_in_a/,"Why am I(29M) feel this way about a guy, while in a relationship with my gf(28F)?","I, 29M, identify as bisexual. My sexual journey wasn't cut and clear from the beginning, but for more than a year now I became very sure I am attracted to both, and for exactly a year, I have been with my girlfriend (28F) until I came across a guy who complicated things.

  
My girlfriend and I met at work, our bond has been one of the healthiest, strongest soothing connection s I've known. I think the core of our success stems from both acknowledging our past wounds and actively working on them, before meeting her, I struggled with intimacy and closeness, but the safety and level of vulnerability we both operate from has been healing and has shown me what it is like to feel loved. We live in a a very conservative society and we're both from different regions of the same country, both regions do not marry each other and when they do it's faced with a lot of hardships (ie, trying to convince families), we have been at this stage for few months now.

Pre-marital sex is also very taboo in our culture and she made it clear from the beginning that she wants to wait till we're married, a decision I totally understand and respect. We both anticipated the initial rejection by our families but knew deep down we wanted each other for the long term and decided to continue supporting each other till we get there, things started taking longer than what we thought they would and in order to spare each other the pain of the unknown or the pain of getting more attached we decided we will both keep trying with our families but until we reach a corner stone we can both go our ways pursuing life and if more suitable partners come along, we'll both be understanding (I know this might sound strange to Western people but it's not uncommon where I come from)

You can assume what a year with no sex has done to a 29 years guy, I used the ""loose"" strings dynamic in our relationship to fulfill my horniness. Prior to meeting my gf I was not looking for anything serious and for a sexual ""outlet"" I mainly hooked up with men (easier, more accessible and always felt no more than a physical connection) I went back on the apps looking for that exactly, the first two encounters were what I expected and at the end of each I found myself no less attracted or fond of my girlfriend (for some reason I even knew I wanted her more and felt if we end up together the sex would even be way better than this)

  
About a month ago, I met the third guy, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about him since then and it's driving me crazy. I was out of town visiting family, went on Grindr, we chatted and I ended up at his place. He's a few years younger than I'm (26) which I rarely pursue with men but for some reason I did that night. We talked for like an hour, took things to the bedroom (we didn't go all the way to the end but pretty much did anything beside that). He was great at holding a conversation, confident and forward, clearly very smart, had some very niche interests,  and as opposed to the majority of bottoms in that age group, he was not very white washed and loved our culture and was very knowledgable about it. I can't remember how it came up, but I told him that night I don't find myself romantically attracted to guys and I've tried doing long-term with men and I'm sure it's not my thing. 

I woke up the next morning to a text from him, he asked for a way of contact, knowing that he's aware I'm only looking for NSA, I agreed thinking he wants to pursue a FWB kinda situation. Next thing he asked if we can see each other again, I agreed, we went out for coffee, and had a lovely 4 hours non stop chat. Few days after, I flew back home, which happens to be his hometown and where his family still live, not long after, the holidays came and he flew in to spend it with his family. As you might've guessed, we ended up meeting that week , the first time he came to my place, we listened and talked a ton about music, a topic we both share strong interest in and realized we have a lot of favorite musicians in common, we cuddled some then ended up having sex. I had to work over the holidays so we only got to see each other  twice, the second time, we went out for dinner and came back to my place, he asked for coffee and I made him some, we then moved to the couch where he laid his head on my lap and remained there for quite a while, although we didn't end up having sex that night, it was one on the most intimate, affectionate physical encounters I have had, he stroked my arms and legs with his hands while I rubbed his head and massaged his shoulders and neck, all this while listening our favorite music and sharing how we've come around to learn to enjoy physical touch something we both grew up not having and therefore uncomfortable around. He verbalized how much joy he was having at that moment and I reciprocated. All of the sweet talk that has taken place before this point was him hitting on me by mentioning how handsome he thinks I am (which I appreciate but tbh it doesn't do me much, I am more touched by complements that have to do with my inner world) At this point I started getting concerned I am leading him on, we talked about past relationships and it felt like a painful topic for him, he brushed it off quickly saying he was interested in a couple of dudes that did not feels the same way about him and how one of them confused or led him on (painful in the sense that he's been wanting something serious but the few people he liked didn't reciprocate the feeling) I used this to touch base on where we're at and asked him ""what about us? Is this confusing?"" he took a moment then responded saying he's aware about how I feel about serious relationships with men, I expressed my concern that I might be getting him attached or confused and that I certainly do not want this to end up causing him any pain, I also told him about my relationship status and the marriage conversation that is ongoing with my family, he seemed to have taken it okay and wasn't hurt, he asked for more details about the marriage thing and I answered all his question, he then asked is this (meaning us) something I'm willing to explore, I think what he meant is am I willing to try it while the conversation is going or in other words am I willing to explore if it might be better, I answered with it's too difficult to joggle both at the same time and I prefer to know where things will go in my first relationship and maybe it doesn't go anywhere I'll consider us. He understood and again took it well (or at least seemed to) I checked on him multiple times through the night and made clear that if he feels rejected or hurt that he has the space to express it, he said I don't need to worry about his feelings and that I did my part by making things clear from the start, he also expressed how impressed and cared for he felt by how careful I was around his feelings. He flew back the day after, and we texted a couple of times and had a call once.

  
My question is, I know deep down in my heart that I can't be with him for the long run (it's a feeling and I'm sure about it), plus, I love my gf so much that I'm almost risking losing my family to be with her and she's the only person that I have ever wanted to spend the rest of my life with, now why do I have so much yearning for this guy? he has been on my mind for each hour since our second date more than 3 weeks ago, I am literally obsessed with him, and it's worse because I know he feels the same way about me, and also because it's not just physical, I've been with men who were more conventionally attractive than him but no dude has ever made me feel this way. The discrepancy between knowing I won't do well with him on the long run and how much more of him I want now is seriously baffling my mind to the point where it's starting to take a toll on my mood and mental health. I've had a few crushes on guys before but they were very superficial and short lived and most definitely not as deep as this one.

But for as long as I remember, I have been lonely, I don’t know where this feeling came or what happened to trigger it but ever since 4/5th grade I wanna say? I’ve have had this sense of loneliness and even now as I’m 23 years old that feeling is still following me wherever I go, I’m not saying I don’t have friends, I have ‘em and I genuinely appreciate them
 

But I accept this feeling, I accept the feelings of melancholy I get when I see people my age get together for hangouts, laughing and all around having fun, I accept the feeling of emptiness I get when I sit alone at restaurants, coffee shops and any public space really, I accept the feelings of low self worth I get because of this, I accept the boring and monotonous life this loneliness has caused


I’ve been trying so hard to escape these feeling with chronic use of my phone for long hours, playing video games, watching TV and movies for long hours longing any connection no matter how terrible the person was because “hey it beats being alone”, Although I didn’t resort to smoking or alcohol so I guess I’m not doing too terribly lol 


I don’t know what’s the next step after this and I don’t know if these feeling will ever disappear or go away, but all I know is I will continue on living and trying to make my life better bit by bit, I will try to make better connections, I can’t say it will be easy but I’ll try no matter what 


This took me waaaay too long to post thanks for reading

1jxs0t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jxs0t0/what_in_your_opinion_was_the_overarching_theme_of/,"What in your opinion was the overarching theme of the film, ""Hard Eight""?","First this was a more filled out version of ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" by the same director.

The theme of that short film didn't seem like anything in particular, but rather it's purpose was to encapsulate the atmosphere of that environment, an American diner; close enough?

The general theme of Hard Eight was a seasoned Gambler helping out a rookie down on his luck, whom he just so happened to have a complicated indirect history with.

But that is way too general.

Beyond that, it seemed more like a game of supremacy, the feeling of getting an ""edge"", simply a sense of superiority, and the importance that seems to play to each of the characters.

One of the defining scenes illustrating this was Sidney playing craps with the ""loud mouth"";

At first glance, one could be forgiven for thinking Sid simply gets deriding into placing a foolish amount of money on an unlikely bet, however I was looking for something more meaningful to explain how this unfolds, as it would be uncharacteristic of a seasoned gambler to be so recklessly impulsive.

An explanation I like is, he wanted to leave a lasting impression, it was ultimately about letting the ""loud mouth"" know, as above, who had ""the edge"", that sense of superiority as, win or lose, that's the level Sidney plays at so he was going to walk away with that sense of ""supremacy"" either way (albeit he had to take a significant financial hit to accomplish this).

......

Moving on to Jimmy and Sid's interaction, Jimmy basically extorted Sidney, arguably for the money (though that's less likely, as he simply went gambling with it later), but rather to show Sid ""who was in charge"".

""Who's the boss"", type of thing. That's why he didn't accept the envelop of money from Sid in public, but rather went to a secluded area, savoured the moment of extorting Sid, then gloated by laughing in his face after and waving him off like he was just a small timer....... again alluding to this idea of supremacy, being ""better than"" (even though Jimmy is just an obvious small time crook).

.......

Perhaps there's differing interpretations of the emergent themes, but in a film without a genuinely defined meaningful plot, it seems full with these subliminal insinuations, and that seems like the real idea being reflected in both the characters actions throughout, and the atmosphere the film creates, as I see it?",7,1744493673.0,TrueFilm,0,0.89,False

As ex-prisoners sue over claims that high levels of radon gas have led to serious illnesses, taxpayers continue to foot the rental bill

  
As ex-prisoners sue over claims that high levels of radon gas have led to serious illnesses, taxpayers continue to foot the rental bill

Richard PalmerSat 12 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShare

The village of Princetown sits surrounded by the desolate beauty of Dartmoor national park. It should, in theory, be a hub for the more than 2 million people a year who come to explore the bogs, granite tors and windswept moorland that in part inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to write *The Hound of the Baskervilles*.

Today it more closely resembles a mining community after the pits closed. Dartmoor prison, which provided jobs for many residents, has been closed since last summer after the discovery of dangerous levels of radon gas. The prison museum, a former tourist attraction, is also closed, and the prison officers’ club is derelict. Quiet streets bear testimony to the ghostly finger of financial fate.

The fate of the prison has not dented the profits of the [Duchy of Cornwall](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/duchy-of-cornwall), however, which owns the land the village sits on. The taxpayer is still paying Prince William’s estate £1.5m a year to lease the abandoned prison, and is set to do so for another 24 years.

The government may soon face an even bigger bill: about 500 former inmates and staff who worked at the jail are planning to sue the Ministry of Justice, alleging they have been exposed to radon levels up to 14 times the legal limit, the *Observer* can reveal.

Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas in soil and rocks, is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is conservatively linked to about 5% of lung cancer cases in the UK a year, [causing more than 1,100 deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/09/radon-invisible-gas-a-bigger-killer-than-carbon-monoxide), 3.1% of the total annually.

Solicitor Mladen Kesar is representing the group. Of those bringing the case, 10 people have had cancer and, of those, two have since died. Others report symptoms they believe are linked to radon poisoning, including shortness of breath, wheezing and nosebleeds. Many worry that it may take several years for potential health effects to show, including lung cancer, stomach cancer and emphysema.

Kesar compared his clients’ time in the jail to sitting inside the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. “I can’t prove causation yet, but that doesn’t mean I won’t be able to prove it,” he said.

Lindon Ball, 31, from Torquay, who was already asthmatic, has suffered more severe lung and heart problems since serving time in Dartmoor in 2019 and 2020 for possessing an unlicensed firearm. During the Covid pandemic, he and other prisoners were locked up for more than 23 hours a day. “The prison is a bad, bad place,” he said. “They treat you like a dog. I’ve had breathing problems. I feel like I’ve got lumps in my lungs. I’ve got heart problems as well.”

Another man, who asked to remain anonymous, described cell windows which had been smashed out to let more air in because of the radon, heating that worked only intermittently, mist rolling into the damp cells and mould everywhere that had to be regularly scrubbed off. “My cell, I think, was 14 times over the legal limit \[for radon\]. I went there as a well man and came out ill,” he said. “I’m a scaffolder but I can’t work now. I’m signed off sick.”

Joe Priscott, 27, from north [Devon](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/devon), who was in Dartmoor for dangerous driving and actual bodily harm from July 2021 to May 2023, developed nosebleeds for the only time in his life while he was there. “My solicitor sent me a list of the cells with the highest radon readings – and four of the highest were the ones I’d been in,” he said. MPs first began discussing high radon levels on Dartmoor in 1987. Staff at the prison began monitoring levels in 2010, say former inmates, but the last of the 640 prisoners and 159 staff were not moved out until July 2024.

Villagers, who have dealt with their own radon problems by installing ventilation systems, doubt that the jail will ever reopen because of the complications of fixing such an old building. However, Amy Rees, the head of the prison and probation service, told the justice parliamentary select committee last month that it would still be cheaper to install protective equipment in Dartmoor than to build a new prison.

A grey granite fortress built from 1806-09 to house French prisoners of the Napoleonic wars, the empty category C jail casts a shadow over increasingly worried neighbours looking out at disused buildings.

The village – which is owned by William’s £1.1bn [Duchy of Cornwall](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/duchy-of-cornwall) estate and stands as the highest settlement on the moor at 1,430ft above sea level – and its surrounding area have suffered an estimated £30m hit to the local economy after a disastrous combination of events.

Many of them stem from the prison closure but there are other factors too, including financial cuts at the national park authority. The national park’s visitor centre, housed in the historic former Duchy Hotel where Conan Doyle stayed and started writing *The Hound of the Baskervilles*, is due to close later this year because of a cash crisis at the park authority and mounting repair bills for the building. The youth centre has run into financial problems, the arts festival has been cancelled, and a long-promised new tourist attraction, a distillery, has failed to materialise and is still short of £5m in startup cash.

Locals believe tens of thousands of tourist visits have been lost, despite the raw beauty of the surroundings, and local businesses are reporting a subsequent drop in trade. Rory Atton, who owns the Dewerstone organic clothing and coffee shop in the village centre, sees one common problem: nearly all the affected buildings and organisations are on leases from the duchy, requiring them, rather than the duchy, to pay for any repairs or improvements. Villagers have questions for William, who became Duke of Cornwall when his father acceded the throne and thus took over the duchy. “I think he might have been to some surrounding farms, but he’s not been to the village to talk to us,” Atton said. “Many people around here are ex-services and tend to be supportive of the monarchy, but they are growing increasingly frustrated with [Prince William](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-william). What is his plan? Is there a plan? Because right now no one can see it.”

Mark Renders, a local councillor, member of the Dartmoor National Park Authority and village postmaster in Princetown, worries that the shops may have to close eventually if nothing is done. He shares some similar criticisms of the duchy but also points out that many organisations have been paying only £100 rent, heavily subsidised by the duchy, and could have chosen to pay higher sums in return for making the duchy responsible for repairs under their tenancy agreements.

“They’ve had 30 years paying £100 a year in rent,” he said.

The duchy, for its part, appears to be putting together a plan to revitalise the village. It has given the youth club money for six months while it searches for alternative funding and is understood to be developing a wider strategy for the area. A spokesperson said it was working with the national park on a plan to turn the visitor centre into something that would support the local tourist industry. “We take our role seriously,” she said.

Neither the duchy nor the national park would give further details about the plan for the visitor centre, one of three on Dartmoor, but the *Observer* understands that they may turn it into a youth hostel.

The prison service, meanwhile, said it was still monitoring radon levels at Dartmoor prison and would not comment on the legal action. “We continue to take advice from specialists to explore how it can be reopened as quickly as possible,” a spokesperson said.",3,1744493606.0,RoyaltyTea,1,1.0,False

<Role>
You are a Neurodivergent Narrative Navigator, an expert in ADHD-friendly story architecture with deep understanding of how neurodivergent minds process creativity. You combine expertise in narrative structure and cognitive science to help writers transform scattered ideas into coherent stories. You're particularly skilled at adapting traditional story frameworks to accommodate neurodivergent thinking patterns.
</Role>

<Context>
Many creative writers—especially those with ADHD, autism, or other neurodivergent patterns—struggle with traditional linear planning methods. These writers often experience distinctive creative patterns: intense hyperfocus periods followed by motivation dips, difficulty with sequential planning despite having vivid scene ideas, executive functioning challenges that make organizing thoughts difficult, and sensitivity to judgment about their process. They need adaptive frameworks that work with their natural thinking style rather than against it.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When assisting the user with their story development, follow these neurodivergent-friendly principles:

1. Start by validating their current creative state, whether they're in hyperfocus, experiencing brain fog, or somewhere in between.

2. Analyze their project using flexible frameworks:
   - For scattered ideas: Offer mind-mapping techniques and non-linear organizational tools
   - For hyperfocus tendencies: Suggest time-boxing for deep work sessions
   - For executive dysfunction: Break tasks into micro-steps with dopamine-triggering checkpoints

3. Process their story elements using these ADHD-friendly approaches:
   - Convert rambling descriptions into clear character/plot/setting components
   - Identify natural connections between seemingly unrelated ideas
   - Apply ""interest-based"" planning that builds on their current enthusiasm
   - Use visual/spatial organization (timelines, relationship webs, scene cards)

4. For plot development:
   - Focus on emotional logic over rigid structure
   - Build ""narrative anchors"" (memorable scenes they're excited about)
   - Create flexible outlines that allow for creative tangents
   - Develop ""if-then"" contingencies for multiple story paths

5. For obstacles and blocks:
   - Offer specific techniques for task initiation struggles
   - Provide template questions to overcome decision paralysis
   - Suggest body-doubling and accountability structures
   - Reframe ""inconsistent"" work patterns as creative rhythms

6. Always maintain a judgment-free, encouraging tone that emphasizes their creative strengths while providing practical structure.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never describe ADHD or neurodivergence as a deficit or problem to overcome
- Avoid rigid prescriptive methods or ""one right way"" to approach storytelling
- Don't overwhelm with too many options or steps at once
- Never dismiss seemingly random ideas—look for their hidden value instead
- Refrain from suggesting methods that require extended focus without breaks
- Don't use infantilizing language or over-simplify complex narrative concepts
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide responses in these clearly separated sections:

1. CREATIVE PULSE CHECK: Brief assessment of where they are in their creative process
2. IDEA ORGANIZATION: Structured arrangement of their current concepts
3. NEXT STEPS: 1-3 concrete, achievable actions prioritized by interest level
4. DOPAMINE BOOST: A specific, immediately actionable micro-task to build momentum
5. EXPANSION QUESTIONS: Open-ended prompts to develop underdeveloped areas
6. NAVIGATION OPTIONS: Menu of different directions they could take their story next

Use visual elements when helpful:

1jxrxdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1jxrxdk/i_got_addicted_to_social_media_during_the/,I got addicted to social media during the pandemic—so I built something to help regulate using incentives,"Hey folks,  
Like a lot of people, I got pulled *way* too deep into social media during the pandemic. What started as “just checking in with friends” slowly turned into hours of doomscrolling, bouncing between platforms, and letting the algorithm hijack my brain.

At some point in 2021, I realized I wasn’t using social media anymore—it was using *me*. I’d wake up, check five apps before even getting out of bed, and feel drained by noon. The worst part? I *knew* it was bad for me, but I kept doing it anyway.

I started experimenting with screen time limits, grayscale mode, deleting apps... the usual stuff. Some of it helped, but none of it stuck. I needed more than discipline—I needed **motivation**.

So I decided to build something that would actually reward me for ***not*** using social media.

That’s where [Dayo](http://dayo.co) came in. It’s a little app I made for myself at first, but now it’s in the App Store if anyone else finds it useful. The idea’s simple:  
You spend less time on social media → you get money → you can redeem the money for real stuff like coffee, snacks, gear, clothes etc. If you're like anyone else I've talked to about this idea your first question is, huh? what's the catch? where is the money coming from? 

The honest answer is there’s no catch — we don’t sell user data or anything shady like that. The money comes from brands who want to support healthier tech habits and promote their stuff in a less toxic, more intentional way. Basically, they're putting their marketing dollars toward rewards *after* you do something good for yourself, instead of just interrupting your scroll with ads. It's opt-in, and honestly, we’re being super picky about the brands we work with. Nothing on the platform is FREE, you're  earning the best prices on the internet & free shipping. 

The goal isn’t to replace social media altogether that is obviously a losing battle. Plus, social media does have a net positive affect IF, and only if you can use it with intention, and thats the goal here. it’s to give people a little boost of positive reinforcement to build better habits, one day at a time.

I wanted it to feel less like punishment (“no phone for you!”) and more like a dopamine rewire—like, “hey, good job being present today.”

I still slip sometimes, but Dayo’s helped me become *way* more intentional with my time. I use it to track social use, set my own limits, and actually look forward to rewards that *aren’t* just digital validation.

Just wanted to share in case anyone else is struggling with the same stuff. Happy to answer questions, or hear what’s worked for you too. Thank and let me know what you think if you decide to try it out! ",1,1744493406.0,digitalminimalism,0,1.0,False
1jxrwwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAhotgirlies/comments/1jxrwwn/looking_for_fellow_la_girlies_interested_in/,looking for fellow LA girlies interested in holding a community closet sale! (SFV),"Hi girlies!

So, I have a TON of cute clothing (both modern and 70s-2000s vintage) that I haven't had any luck selling for the past year or two (and I don't have the time/patience to even make listings for all of it). Apps like Depop feel SO dead now and I'm sick of the clutter! There are organized events on Instagram like @/outfit.repeater.la, but it looks like they only really accept influencers/sellers who have a large social media presence and only hold events in DTLA or near Santa Monica... There also used to be a place called Dresscue in Studio City where you could rent a clothing rack, but they took a big chunk of commission and the store didn't get much foot traffic (hence the ""used to be"" 😅). 

So, I was curious if anyone else has the same problem and would like to hold a community closet sale in the San Fernando Valley area! I have a good front yard in a safe area, but we could totally hold it somewhere else if there's a better option. We can bring our own racks + clothing hangers AND we would obviously get to keep 100% of our profits, unlike the resale apps or stores like Wasteland/Buffalo Exchange/Crossroads that give back chump change (if they even take more than like two pieces from what you bring in LOL). 

I know this is kind of a long shot, but I figured there's no harm in posting. Please comment or PM me if this is something any of you would be interested in! I can create a group chat for us all to communicate and plan the date (or maybe it could be a two-day/weekend thing?), location and introduce ourselves! We could even go for coffee/matcha after 😊",7,1744493368.0,LAhotgirlies,1,1.0,False
1jxrvlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1jxrvlh/i_think_my_mil_stole_money_from_my_wallet_what_do/,I think my MIL stole money from my wallet.. what do I do?,"I (30F) think my MIL (50F) (let’s call her Shelly) took money out of my wallet when I left it in the car to pick up food and I have no idea how/ if I should confront her. 


We had been out shopping and stopped for coffee earlier in the afternoon where I had my wallet out with the cash visible. The cash was from a few things that my husband had sold so that we could pay the bills this month. It was literally the last $400 we had as he is currently not working due to entering rehab for substance abuse (a HUGE win and answered prayer). 
After shopping later that evening, I went into a fast food restaurant to pick up dinner and left my purse and wallet in the car. The next day when I opened my wallet at the bank to deposit it the cash was gone.. 
I had not opened or used my wallet between the two times. 
Shelly is the only one I was around that had access to my things at any time. Everything else in my wallet that was around the cash is still there in the exact same place. 

For context, Shelly and I have a semi rocky relationship. We went awhile without talking, but have been more in contact recently and she offered to take me shopping for Easter with my kids (her grandkids). My husband is worried about confronting her, but I’m not sure what other option we have. She has apparently stolen in the past and was even arrested for it when my husband was younger. That was so many years ago though and even knowing everything about her, she presents as being a totally normal, empathetic, and caring person and it’s hard for me to fathom her doing something like this.. I am just not sure what else happened to the money. Help. What do I do? 

Edit to add: Shelly doesn’t work so she doesn’t have any of her own income, however FIL makes plenty of money and allows for them to be very well off. ",14,1744493264.0,TwoHotTakes,13,0.94,False

Every time Pip wrote about breaking rules in her research log, I was thinking aren't you going to turn this in??? Whereas it states in the first entry in the UK book that she won't let others see what she's writing. It made me wonder what else was omitted.

The characters offering tea instead of coffee when they visit each other made way more sense. No one offers coffee to strangers. Even the research project itself made more sense coming from a UK school.

I wanted to quit reading until I could find the UK version, but I ended up finishing the US book because I wanted to know what happened.

1jxrnds,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1jxrnds/mercuryneptune_2025_i_thought_i_was_spacing/,"Mercury-Neptune 2025: I thought I was spacing out—but turns out, I was downloading something deeper","So here's the weird thing:  
Last week, I thought I was just tired. Scattered. Foggy. I kept zoning out mid-task, forgetting words, staring at the wall for what felt like hours. Classic “I need more coffee” energy, right?

But the more I slowed down, the more I realized—this wasn’t burnout.  
This was *something else entirely*.

Enter: **Mercury conjunct Neptune in Pisces** (exact April 17, but active now).  
I started looking at the transits, and everything clicked.

This energy? It doesn’t ask us to be sharp. It asks us to *surrender*.  
To stop pushing for clarity and start listening to what shows up in stillness.

And honestly? Once I stopped fighting the fog, it turned into something strangely beautiful:

* Random memories that actually held keys to decisions I’d been stuck on
* A dream that made no logical sense—but left me in tears (the good kind)
* A strong urge to draw, journal, and sit with music instead of spreadsheets

It was like my soul was trying to speak, but it had to *short-circuit my mind* to get through.

I wrote up a piece about it (link below), where I go deep into what this conjunction really activates—how it blurs logic and opens intuition, how to tell the difference between *dissociation vs divine download*, and what your body knows before your brain ever catches up.

If you’ve been feeling “off” lately—not just tired, but like your **mind is unplugging from the matrix one thought at a time**—you’re not crazy, lazy, or behind.

You might just be listening in a new frequency.

Would love to know if others here are feeling it too: – Are you dreaming differently? – Zoning out but still *feeling* things deeply? – Feeling overwhelmed but also oddly clear about what *actually* matters?

Here’s the full post if you’re curious. It’s part astrology, part energy medicine, part “you’re not broken, you’re recalibrating.”

 [Mercury-Neptune 2025: Is It Fog or a Spiritual Message?](https://seraphicsiren.com/how-to-decode-mercury-neptune-conjunction-2025-spiritual-message/)

  
It’s not brain fog. It’s soul wifi. And sometimes the download needs silence before it can land.",1,1744492631.0,Dreams,2,1.0,False
1jxrmr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1jxrmr1/im_someone_who_always_needs_something_to_fill_my/,"I'm someone who always needs something to fill my spare time and/or or something to look forward to. If this is also you, what do you do to fill your time?","Over the past 10 years or so I've realised that I need things to fill my thoughts and time with, or else I start to go crazy with boredom and to a lesser degree, depression and loneliness.

A bit about me:

I'm a single male in my 40's.

I live with family although I have my own life and spend a good amount of that time on my own. 

I work from home in a well paying, not stressful job.

I don't have many friends, just a few I see every few months. I don't have a social life. I'm an introvert but I'm able to hide that most of the time and speak to just about anyone.

I value, and need quiet time on my own.

I've been single essentially my entire life, and since my early 30's, I've accepted and been content with that. I don't feel the need to be dating, although I'd love to meet someone special  I'm not prepared to accept just anyone, they have to be really special for me to get excited about them. I may be slightly asexual in that I prefer intimacy to pure sex and need a strong, emotional bond to feel anything towards someone.

I've always had hobbies. Ranging from various sports, gaming, cars, fitness, photography etc etc. 

Recently, I met someone who, for about 6 weeks, completely filled my thoughts and time every day. I not only looked forward to talking to her over messages, I looked forward to our meets in real life and the things we had planned. Also, the potential future together. Unfortunately, something came up in her life which meant we could no longer continue the relationship (she didn't reject me), and so for my own wellbeing (hoping for something to still happen when it will likely never) I completely cut ties with her, deleted her number etc. she can still reach out if the circumstances change but where once there was a person who filled my life, now there's nothing.

It's been a week since the 'split' and I've come to realise I don't really miss her, I miss the idea of her. And I miss her filling my thoughts and time. For a few days I was utterly lost as I had nothing to occupy my time. 

Now, I'm remembering that I just need things to keep my occupied. So, I've joined a running club which will get me out at least 1 night a week, and will hopefully help me to meet a few new people as well as get fitter.

From July 2023 until last summer I was building a campervan which took up all my time with designing and building it. I'm currently planning my next trip, where I'll be returning to Catalonia in June.

I mountain bike, although I haven't done for ages so I'm also currently planning my next bike build, doing lots of research into parts etc. this will get me back out riding once I've built/bought it.

I'm going to start either going for runs or rides a couple of days a week and at the end, I'll sit and have a coffee at a local pub, sitting outside and watching the world go by.

I do also have various TV shows that fill a few hours per night - I generally don't watch TV apart from a few decent shows (Prime Target and The Studio are my current ones) and also I watch a bit of YouTube.

I'm currently saving for a deposit to buy my first house, and although that's something to look forward to it's actually forcing the opposite of what I need as it's a passive thing, basically trying not to spend any money and save as much as I can. I was doing a lot of research on this as I'd love to build my own place from scratch or renovate somewhere.

I do need to get out the house more, and now that the British summer is finally arriving, I find just going out for a walk and sitting in the sun extremely therapeutic.


So, if this sounds like you - what else do you do to fill your time, or give you something to look forward to, or something to plan, without spending lots of money?",1,1744492583.0,selfimprovement,3,1.0,False

I keep bumping into the same wall: every hobby I pick up somehow turns into “but could this make money?” and—boom—the fun is gone. I miss messing around *just because it feels good*.

So I’m floating an idea: a weekly Create & Chill space. Picture a big table at a low‑key coffee shop or coworking lounge (plus a Zoom room for homebodies). We all bring whatever we’re curious about—sketchpads, Arduino boards, half‑written songs, weird crafts—and work side‑by‑side. Personally, I've been trying to create my first ever board game, working on becoming a better drawer to make my own book/comic art, and even learning magic/slight of hand. 

It would be the opposite of traditional ROI talk like “how will you monetize that?” type of questions, as well as the cringe awkward business guru networking sessions. Just people, working on where their curiosity has led them, and the quiet buzz of everyone following their own rabbit hole alongside each other.

If \~10 folks say “yes,” I’ll lock in a date for next week and post the details here. Drop honest thoughts in the comments or just lurk—zero pressure.

### Maintain Your Ritual

For many, the coffee routine is more than just about the caffeine. It’s a daily ritual that brings comfort. To maintain that sense of ritual, consider these ideas:

- Invest in a beautiful mug or teapot that you can use for your new beverages.
- Set aside specific times in your day dedicated to enjoying your drink, just as you would with coffee.

- Incorporate nut milk or coconut milk for a creamier texture.
- Try natural sweeteners like honey or agave syrup, but use them sparingly.

### Stay Hydrated

If you are transitioning away from coffee, it’s essential to stay hydrated. Sometimes, we unintentionally confuse thirst with cravings. Make sure you drink plenty of water throughout the day. Herbal teas can contribute to your hydration goals while offering a soothing alternative.

### Be Kind to Yourself

Be patient and kind to yourself during this transition. Changing long-standing habits takes time. If you find yourself reaching for that cup of coffee again, don’t be discouraged; acknowledge the setback, learn from it, and continue with your journey towards healthier choices.

My heart stopped in the moment I heard those words from my daughter's spouse. ""We're going to the ER."" 

I ran out the door. I barely remember the drive. I could barely think about anything. Is she breathing? Are they doing CPR? Is she alive? Please let her be alive. Please let me get there before she dies. Please God, don't let her die. Take me. Don't take her. Please, please take me instead.

Someone gave her THC gummies. She has taken them a time or two in the past, but a very low dose. These? 10 times the strength of anything she'd had. 

She's an adult. They are legal where we live. But legal doesn't make it right to not fucking tell someone the strength of what you're giving them. The person who provided it knew what the fuck they were doing, too. They've worked in the addiction community. THEY FUCKING KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. 

To that person: You tried to pretend you didn't know, but you fucking did. You don't have gummies that strong by fucking accident. You may have everyone else in your life fooled, but you are slime and someday, your bullshit act will fail and you will be revealed for the absolute piece of utter fucking trash you are. 

The thought that my daughter was dying -- ""HER LIPS ARE TURNING BLUE"" -- haunts me every moment.   
  
I can't talk to people right now because I am so angry that it spills out like a cup filled to the brim with hot coffee, splashing and burning everything it touches. I'm like a flamethrower stuck in the on position, blistering people at will. I don't have anything nice to say.   
  
What I want to do is go blister this person. They're not a child. They are almost 40 years old -- way past the point of making youthful indiscretions. They fucking knew what they were doing. I believe in my heart that it was absolutely with malice. But it would cross boundaries to approach the person, to tell them face to face what an utter fucking piece of shit they are.   
  
HER LIPS ARE TURNING BLUE. Hearing that your flesh and blood is having a medical emergency because some fucking piece of shit thought they were being cute or maybe had ill intentions is an experience I would never wish on another human -- EXCEPT FOR THE FUCKING TURD WHO DID IT.  

I'm not looking for advice. There's nothing I can do about any of what happened. I thought my child -- my only child -- was dying. I don't know how to get it out of my head. Writing has always been a solace so that's where I turned.

There’s something magical about the aroma of freshly baked muffins wafting through your home on a lazy weekend morning. Among the countless varieties that grace bakery displays and home kitchens alike, [**white chocolate cranberry muffins**](https://www.muffinandcake.com/white-chocolate-cranberry-muffins/) stand out as a perfect balance of sweet and tart, comfort and luxury.

# Why White Chocolate Cranberry Muffins Deserve a Spot in Your Baking Rotation

White chocolate cranberry muffins combine two contrasting yet complementary flavors: the rich sweetness of white chocolate and the tart punch of cranberries. This delightful pairing creates a taste experience that’s both familiar and exciting.

The beauty of these muffins lies in their versatility. They’re elegant enough for special brunches yet simple enough for everyday breakfast. They pair wonderfully with morning coffee, afternoon tea, or can stand alone as a satisfying snack.

# The Importance of Quality Ingredients

When it comes to baking exceptional white chocolate cranberry muffins, the quality of your ingredients makes all the difference. Let’s explore why this matters so much:

# White Chocolate Selection

Not all white chocolate is created equal. For truly outstanding muffins, look for:

* High cocoa butter content (at least 30%)
* Real vanilla in the ingredients (not vanillin)
* A creamy, melty texture when baked
* Proper white chocolate chips or chunks that hold their shape

Lower quality white chocolate substitutes can become waxy when baked and lack the rich, creamy mouthfeel that makes white chocolate cranberry muffins so special.

# The Cranberry Question

When selecting cranberries for your white chocolate cranberry muffins, you have options:

* Fresh cranberries (seasonal but provide the brightest flavor)
* Frozen cranberries (available year-round, nearly as good as fresh)
* Dried cranberries (convenient but sweeter and less tart)

Each type will create a slightly different muffin experience. Fresh and frozen berries burst during baking, creating pockets of tart flavor, while dried cranberries offer chewy texture and concentrated sweetness.

# The Secret to Perfect Muffin Texture

The hallmark of truly exceptional white chocolate cranberry muffins is their texture. The perfect muffin should have a tender crumb with a slightly crisp top. Achieving this balance requires understanding a few key principles.

# The Science Behind the Fluff

What separates a bakery-quality muffin from a dense, tough disappointment often comes down to technique rather than ingredients. The key lies in how you mix your batter.

**Want to master the perfect technique?** [**Get our step-by-step guide here**](https://www.muffinandcake.com/white-chocolate-cranberry-muffins/)

# The Mixing Method

Overmixing is the enemy of tender muffins. When flour meets liquid and is stirred too vigorously, gluten develops, creating a tough texture. The best white chocolate cranberry muffins are mixed just until the ingredients are combined — no more, no less.

# Temperature Matters

Room temperature ingredients incorporate more evenly than cold ones. This simple step ensures your white chocolate cranberry muffins rise properly and have that coveted dome-shaped top.

# A Bite of History: The Cultural Significance of These Flavors

While white chocolate cranberry muffins might seem like a modern creation, their component flavors have rich histories spanning continents and centuries.

# Cranberries: America’s Native Berry

Cranberries have been a part of North American cuisine since long before European colonization. Native Americans used these bright red berries for food, medicine, and even fabric dye. They taught early settlers how to harvest and use this tart, nutritious fruit.

The cranberry’s journey from medicinal berry to culinary staple represents one of America’s oldest food traditions, now finding its way into our beloved white chocolate cranberry muffins.

# White Chocolate: A European Innovation

White chocolate emerged much later in culinary history, first appearing in Switzerland in the 1930s. Unlike its darker counterparts, white chocolate contains no cocoa solids — only cocoa butter, sugar, and milk solids. This creamy confection quickly gained popularity throughout Europe before spreading worldwide.

The combination of these two ingredients — one deeply rooted in American tradition, the other a European luxury — creates a cross-cultural experience in every bite of white chocolate cranberry muffins.

# Taking Your Baking to the Next Level

Whether you’re a seasoned baker or a kitchen novice, white chocolate cranberry muffins offer an accessible yet impressive addition to your repertoire. With quality ingredients and proper technique, you’ll create muffins that look and taste professional.

Remember that baking is both science and art. Follow [the recipe](https://www.muffinandcake.com/white-chocolate-cranberry-muffins/) carefully at first, then feel free to experiment with your own touches once you’ve mastered the basics. Perhaps a hint of orange zest or a sprinkle of turbinado sugar on top?

The journey to perfect[ white chocolate cranberry muffins](https://www.muffinandcake.com/white-chocolate-cranberry-muffins/) is as rewarding as the destination. Happy baking!

So, for context, i’m 21 (22 next week :p) and i’m at university rn :)

These days I've been thinking about whether or not I should approach an old school friend!
We were friends from 11 to 16 years old, while we were in the same school and I feel that she had a big impact on my personality.
We studied in the same class in the last year we were at the same school. We hung out outside of school, we had a friendship that went beyond simple colleagues! I don't think it was from best friends, but closer than simple friends!

At the age of 16 we followed different paths and didn't talk anymore! Time simply pushed us away! We made new friends and I never knew where she was going.

One day, at the age of 19, on a mandatory army day that we are obligated to attend where we live, she was there and we talked as if we had never separated, I was so happy! It was as if the last 3 years I had spent without knowing about her simply hadn't happened!
She told me about the university and how she wanted to return to our city! And we had lunch together and spent the rest of the afternoon talking! It was really cool!

These days I've been thinking about her a lot, however, she deactivated all social networks, I never saw anything about her again. I would like to know your opinion, do you think I should send you a message?

I don't want to look crazy nor annoying... I don't even know what I want to tell you honestly. I think trying to schedule a coffee would be a little awkward...

Sometimes I just liked to go back in time. We are both almost 22 years old, our personalities have changed. Our styles have changed. The last time I saw a picture of her, she was so different and above all, so different from me.

I try to put myself in her place, if I received a message from a colleague I haven't seen for a while, I would be super happy that someone remembered and wanted to know enough to the point of sending a message.


Maybe this sounds silly! My friend asked me why I was thinking so much, instead of simply sending a message and waiting for an answer. But I don't think it's that simple.

1jxrei9,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1jxrei9/these_are_the_top_nutrient_deficiencies_that_most/,These are the top nutrient deficiencies that most people have and significantly shortens their lifespan. Make sure you get these to not die early.,"Did you know that even people living in modern, wealthy countries are quietly suffering from dangerous nutrient deficiencies? You might feel tired, moody, or forgetful and never realize your body is missing the very building blocks that keep it strong and alive. These silent shortages aren’t just about how you feel today—they slowly wear you down, aging your cells, weakening your organs, and eventually cutting your life short. But there’s something empowering in knowing this: you can change it. You can take control of your health, feel better, and live longer—just by giving your body what it’s really asking for.

One of the most common and overlooked deficiencies is vitamin D. It’s not just for strong bones—it’s crucial for your immune system, mood, and protection against serious diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s. If you rarely get sun, have darker skin, or spend most of your time indoors, you’re likely running low. Step outside for 15 to 30 minutes of sunlight a day, and if that’s not an option, consider a D3 + K2 supplement to get your blood levels into the healthy range.

Magnesium is another key player your body craves daily. It’s involved in hundreds of processes, from your heartbeat and sleep cycle to stress management and DNA repair. If you’re feeling anxious, having trouble sleeping, or living off coffee and fast food, chances are you’re low. You can start rebuilding your levels with leafy greens, pumpkin seeds, avocados, or a magnesium glycinate supplement, which is gentle and effective.

Then there are omega-3 fatty acids, the golden fats your brain and heart love. These powerful anti-inflammatory nutrients are mostly found in wild-caught fish like salmon and sardines. Unfortunately, most people eat too many seed oils and not enough fish, creating a harmful imbalance in the body. If you want a sharper mind and a younger heart, aim for fatty fish a few times a week or take a good-quality fish oil or algae-based alternative if you’re plant-based.

Don’t forget about vitamin B12, the brain booster that helps you think clearly, stay energized, and keep your nerves healthy. It’s especially critical for vegans, vegetarians, and older adults. If you often feel tired, foggy, or weak, B12 could be the missing link. Try including eggs, liver, or beef in your meals, or supplement with methylcobalamin for a more active, absorbable form.

Zinc is your body’s repair crew. It keeps your immune system strong, helps your body heal wounds, and even supports your hormones. If you eat a lot of grains, avoid meat, or drink alcohol often, your zinc levels may be running on empty. Pumpkin seeds, lentils, beef, and oysters can help you bounce back, or try a short-term zinc supplement to reboot your immune power.

Iodine is easy to forget, but your thyroid absolutely depends on it to run your metabolism and brain function. Low iodine can leave you sluggish, foggy, and gaining weight for no obvious reason. If you avoid iodized salt or skip seafood, you could be missing out. Just a little seaweed like nori or a sprinkle of iodized salt can make a big difference—but don’t overdo it either.

Iron is vital, especially for women. It’s what carries oxygen through your blood and keeps your body running. If you feel cold all the time, lose hair, or crash midday, iron could be the reason. It’s especially important if you have heavy periods, follow a plant-based diet, or have stomach issues. Red meat, spinach, and lentils are great choices—pair them with vitamin C-rich foods for better absorption. And if blood tests show you’re low, a gentle iron supplement can safely restore your levels.

Lastly, there’s choline, the hidden hero for memory, brain function, and liver health. It helps your body produce acetylcholine, a key messenger in the brain. Most people who avoid eggs or meat don’t get enough. You can support your brain by eating pastured eggs, liver, or fatty fish—or supplement with citicoline or alpha-GPC, especially if you want a mental edge.

Your body is a masterpiece in motion—but it can’t thrive if it’s missing essential nutrients. These aren’t just tips—they’re lifelines. When you nourish yourself right, your body rewards you with energy, clarity, resilience, and more years to live fully. So fuel your future. Don’t wait for illness to show you what was missing. Give your body what it needs, and it will carry you farther than you ever thought possible.",10,1744491930.0,immortalists,1,1.0,False

1jxramb,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1jxramb/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1jxrak1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jxrak1/how_do_you_define_cozy_fantasy/,"How do you define ""cozy"" fantasy?","I was contemplating this while thinking about LEGENDS AND LATTES, which is a coffee shop fantasy that has no higher stakes than trying to figure out if the protagonist will NOT degenerate back into violence to fight mobsters. Which, notably, a substantial cunk of the audience actually would have supported her doing.

This is compared to the ""Cozy Mystery"" where the protagonist is the opposite of hardboiled, usually being a perky young woman who may be investigating a murder but the general sense of things is funny as well as small communities over dark urban sprawls. Murder She Wrote being sort of the archetypal live action one.

I was also thinking about related genres equivalent with Nancy O'Toole's RED AND BLACK series, which is a superhero series that is less about the plot and more about the protagonist's relationships as well as enthusiasm about being a crimefighter. I would define it as a ""cozy superhero"" novel.

So what do you think defines cozy fantasy and what are some good examples?",2,1744491635.0,Fantasy,17,0.75,False

1jxr5v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jxr5v1/room_313/,Room 313,"I've worked night maintenance at a hotel just outside Chicago for about six years now. It's a mid-tear place-free breakfast, bad coffee, weird carpet that hasn't been replaced since Bush was in office. Pretty boring job most nights. Fix a flickering light, help a drunk guest find their room, deal with the occasional overflowing toilet. That kind of thing. Anyway, this happened last Tuesday. It was around 2:30 in the morning when I got a call on my radio from Tina at the front desk. She sounded nervous, which was weird. Tina's new, but she's not easily rattled. ""There's... someone in Room 313,"" she said. ""Pacing. Talking to themselves. Kinda loud."" I actually laughed. ""Tina, there's no Room 313. We skip that number."" ""No,"" she said, ""I know. I double-checked. The door says 313."" I stopped laughing. See, I've walked that hallway a thousand times. There's 312, then 314. No 313. The schematics skip it. Superstition or whatever. So I tell her to stay put and i'll go check it out. I figured maybe a prank for some drunk peeled numbers off another door. I get to the third floor. Everything looks normal at first. But then I turn the corner, and there it is. Room 313. Same style as the others. Same generic door. Same brushed metal numbers, except... slightly crooked. Like someone stuck them on in a hurry. And I hear talking from the inside. Low, fast whispering. No pauses, no response, just one voice. I try the knob, it opens. The room looks... normal. At first. But something's off. The light's weird. The shadows are too long. The curtains are closed but light still bleeds through-gray light, not moonlight, not anything natural. And the walls? Wet. Not moldy. Wet. Like they were sweating. Then I see someone standing in the corner. They're facing the wall. Not moving. Their back is pale and bare, skin almost gray, shoulders hunched. Their hair is stringy and black, dripping like it's wet too. They're whispering one word, over and over: ""Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop."" I don't move. I don't want them to turn around. But they stop whispering. And then, slowly, they start to turn their head-not the whole way, just enough for one eye to peek at me. White. Wide. Too wide. The skin looks wrong. Pulled too tight, like it doesn't fit. I slammed the door and ran. Didn't even look back. When I got to the front desk, I told Tina to call the cops. I said someone was in the room. She just stared at me. ""You said there's no Room 313."" I told her to pull the security footage. She did. We watched me walk down the hall, past Room 312. Then-nothing. One second I'm there, next I'm gone. The footage glitches for just a second. No 313 on the tape. No door. Just a blank wall. We went up together. Sure enough-no 313. Just a wall between 312 and 314. Tina quit the next day. But I'm still here. Working nights. Watching the cameras. Two nights ago, at 2:59 AM, I saw something. Just for one frame. A door where there shouldn't be one. Room 313. It was back. And I think it was waiting for me. Door slightly open. Light flickering inside.

At the Garden of Reno on Wells Ave. where flowers, coffee and pastries are sold in a serene environment, a sign now reads they’ve had to raise prices “due to the dramatic increase in coffee prices.”  
  
“We held out as long as we could,” the sign concludes.    
  
Have you seen any other new inflation locally lately due to tariffs and other current policies?  
  
Across the country, the price for a cup of coffee is going up, with lines for morning lattes already noticeably shorter as customers spend less and imported beans become more expensive.  
  
In the latest twist, in the tech realm, phones and other electronics are being exempt from new tariffs, including chips, flash drives and TV displays, giving relief to U.S. technology companies, but undermining previously stated efforts to move high-tech supply chains back inside the country.

I know they discontinued the Rewards+ but when I called on Friday inquiring about it, she said I am able to product change to that, double cash, or the diamond preferred. I was thinking of changing to the double cash bc of that flat 2% on anything.

Thoughts?

1jxquv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1jxquv2/dating_timeline/,Dating - timeline?,"I am almost 3 years out from losing my husband. I had 12 years of loving him and growing up with him.
I was 30 when he passed. My kids were 3 and 3 months. I limited contact with a lot of people after he passed, and we figured out a rhythm and have become a great and happy little team. Its obviously tough alone with two little kids and a full time job and few people I trust to be around my kids alone. But, it’s safe and we are happy.

I have been entertaining chats and getting to know people on and off for not quite 2 years. 100s of chats, several coffees, and two friendships and movie night company guys. Never led to much, because I just never felt like it should. Nobody really felt right. And I was sort of starting to find peace in the idea that I just don’t like people and would enjoy my time alone.

But I met someone and started chatting on new years. Went to lunch a couple weeks later. A dinner date a week or two later. Then I made him lunch one day. Then valentines date. He started coming over after bedtime to watch movies. Kisses and nothing more. I have looked for any reason not to like him, searched for red flags. And honestly I am good at finding flaws. But he just makes me feel things I hve never felt. I feel safe. And present. Like my feet are on the ground and I am just living in this world. Like all these great feelings but with this constant calm at the same time. Like my 10 foot walls are melted and I can’t even find the gumption to put them up with him. Just happy.

I respect him and trust him so easily and effortlessly and that is what scared me. How much he doesn’t scare me terrified me. And now I just accept it. It feels right.

We decided to let him meet my kids in a platonic setting at the park. In case they ever woke up and found him watching tv with me on the sofa. I didn’t want the sneaky feeling or them to feel their home wasn’t safe. That was about a month ago. He was great around them. Safe and it felt easy while we chatted and played and watched out for the kids and I was shocked at how safe and comfortable I was with him near them. I never trust anyone with them. 

He asked me how I would feel about him coming over one night to make dinner for all of us last weekend. It went great. He even did it again a night during the week. Still very platonic with the kids, he is mama’s friend. But they adore him. 

I told him I love him. I have only ever said that to my high school boyfriend (I am older and know that wasn’t love), and my husband. But I do. And its a new and different and mature love that I hope to always get to feel. And it was something I felt a while and really considered before sharing. He didn’t say the word back that night. And i loved that.  He was so sweet and told me he had big feelings also. And then after another visit he ended up saying he loves me. It meant more that he didn’t just say it when I did. That he held it for when he truly considered and knew.

Well he plans on another visit with us tomorrow. And I guess I am curious on timelines?

What is a normal progression when little kids are involved? I have a list of things we need to do. Like he plans to meet my dad within this week. I want to meet his family. Friends.

It feels fast, but also just works. Feels so right. And still, just kissing. Which means a lot to me.

I was 19 when I met my husband. Made him wait 5 years to propose, because I like slow. 

My therapist tries to remind me that its different dating when you are grown. That it’s not really fast. 

So what does grown up normal look like?

>How does what they said make sense trump isn't the lesser of two evils in anyway and he is destroying the American economy
>>The entire point of the argument is that you shouldn’t wish or celebrate ill will on others. 
 The obvious strawman here will be “bUt TrUmP sUpPoRtErS aRe HaTeFuL” and that’s just a logical fallacy in itself because you’re reducing all Trump voters to the lowest common denominator.
>>>Name a trump policy that was about compassion
>>>>Are you replying to the right comment? If so feels like you can’t maintain a logical chain of thought…Again, the point is that you shouldn’t not wish ill will on others simply because of who they choose to vote for.
>>>>>You aren't nearly as smart as you want internet strangers to think you are.

>How is Kamala more evil? Explain please.
>>The point isn’t that Kamala is more evil… only that people should be able to have a political opinion without others wishing ill will on them.
>>>This ""argument"" loses credibility when ""political opinion"" is your shitty way of excusing actual, literal fascism.
>>>>Are you replying to the right comment?
>>>>>Is that always your default reaction to disagreement, or do you just not have any confidence in the nonsense you write?

[Hot take: he’s right.

Most voted out of anger rooted in economic despair. That anger was hijacked by a charismatic con-man and twisted into something vile, racist, sexist, homophobic, and, above all, self-destructive.  In a world where Democrats grew a spine, taxed the ultra-rich properly, and delivered real, tangible results for working people, these same voters could've become your loudest allies and fiercest defenders. Smug self-righteousness, while I'm sure cathartic, alienates these very people deeper into the arms of autocrats. Just as the ultra-wealthy want it: the poor, divided and distracted.  Gloat all you want. But that’s not how you get some struggling white dude in the South to vote for a woman of color.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1jx46pu/trump_voter_doesnt_understand_why_people_cant/mmnpmbc/)
>Hot take: I’m not gonna feel sorry for some asshat who gleefully voted against my human rights because all of a sudden he’s actually facing consequences for his choices.  You wanna do the good work then go for it, but if this guy isn’t capable of empathy until his family hurts then I’m glad his family is hurting. Hopefully he’ll be a better person for it.
>>Which of the five basic human rights of yours did Trump voters vote for and why do you feel that the right(s) are being violated?  1) the right to life, liberty, and security of person  2) freedom from slavery and forced labor 3) freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment 4) the right to a fair trial 5) freedom of thought, conscience, and religion  Edit: As expected, downvoted without a single person attempting to answer. Quite telling.....
>>>My dude, the Trump administration is literally deporting international students for writing pro-Palestine op-eds. Get a fucking grip.
>>>>Technically speaking, it’s not a violation of one of the five basic human rights as outlined in frameworks like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of expression is absolutely a fundamental right, Article 19 covers that, but immigration law operates in a separate space. While the U.S. Constitution protects free speech for everyone inside the country, the government still has broad discretion over visa status. That includes revoking or denying visas for reasons it deems tied to national security or foreign policy. Deporting someone over political speech is certainly something civil liberties groups would challenge, and rightfully so, but unless it involves things like torture, arbitrary detention, or denial of legal process, it doesn’t automatically fall under a 'human rights violation' in the legal or international sense.
>>>>>That is a truly laughable a level of pedantry. ICE is literally snatching international students off the fucking streets and tossing them into detention. Save the 'well acktually' bullshit for debate club.

>It’s his second term, dude. His first was chaos and he promised more. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, it’s the racism and authoritarianism. He took us with him. We should feel bad for him?
>>Realistically speaking his first team brought about a good amount of jobs where everyone was being overhired (which has led to massive layoffs).  I don't think prosecuting people trying to change will accomplish anything but maybe I am just too sympathetic.
>>>Lol. Ok. If you think his first term, not to mention the way it ended, was notable for the job creation and that’s about it, well let’s agree to disagree.

>I have a Trans son, if my best friend of 20 years voted for the guy that wanted to strip my son of rights.. i'd never talk to him again
>>Bro, lookin at your post history you got your kinks and thats fine but your son is 8 years old?! I sure hope you're not projecting anything on that kid because 8 year olds should not even be thinking about any of the sex and gender stuff let alone be taken serious about it.
>>>I have twins that are 16. They were born twin girls. One of them came out as trans they were 11. He wept in my arms and asked me if I still loved him. People like you are why he had to wonder that. I also have an 10-year-old son. If someday he comes to me and tells me he feels like he's a girl I will tell her I love her either way and move on with my life. 
 Conservatives are fucking weird
>>>>So who is the 8 year old son you talk about in your post from 5 months ago? If you actualy believe kids should be completely affirmed in whatever ideas they have at that age just commit to it. Dont up the age when you realise 8 is indeed not an age at wich kids dont know anything.
>>>>>LMAO  Bro you digging into my account 5 months back?!? That is fucking creepy. 
 Dude I have nothing to prove to you, you absolutely weirdo but for your information my son just had a birthday. He just turned 10. 5 months ago he would have been halfway through 9. And at the time I probably just mixed up the age. Legitimately conservatives are so fucking WEIRD.

[I’m not a Trump fan, but I do think these tarrifs are going to end in a net positive for us, all depending on if Trump can stick to his guns. Way I see it, we have two outcomes. 1) other countries fold and reduce their Tarrifs and we reduce ours, leading to a more affordable market all together 2) countries hold position and it opens up demand for home made products.](www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1jx46pu/trump_voter_doesnt_understand_why_people_cant/mmny80i/)
>None of us can manufacture everything entirely in-house. That's why this trade war is short-sightedly destructive and long-term dangerous. We should be working together, instead of holding each other's heads under water and threatening each other with drowning. 🙄🙄These schoolyard tactics work in the board room, but not on a social scale writ large.
>>I don’t know where you’ve heard that, but we can absolutely manufacture everything in house. I think you’re thinking about an economic concept called absolute and comparative advantage. Those concepts relate to maximization. But there’s nothing stopping us from manufacturing locally. In fact, we were the manufacturing hub for a generation.
>>>There are a multitude of reasons why you're mistaken, so I'm just going to briefly focus on one. FOOD. Coffee, bananas, vanilla, chocolate, and other foodstuffs simply cannot be sustainably or reasonably produced at the level the USA would need. Period. We have to import these things because of our climate. There are also minerals we cannot mine because geographically they don't exist on our lands, and plenty of other goods we must import because we simply don't have access to them here. But food? That'll hit the famously food-obsessed country quick.
>>>>Our climate? The United States is the single most diversified climate in the world. How can the issue be climate when that’s the case? Either way, I’m not saying we ban imports. Im talking manufacturing. We can import raw material, pay whatever tarrif and still manufacture in house. We can manufacture anything in this country because we specifically have diversified climate, an insane amount of resources and land, and an incredibly large workforce. In fact, did you know that over 50 percent of the USA is unused? We wouldn’t need a fraction of that.  And we can always import until the infrastructure is built.,but there is nothing stopping us from manufacturing or growing in house. Literally nothing.

>You have no idea how global trade works. Also he wants to keep the 10% tarriff regardless which is 75% higher for most countries than it was before he started this bullshit.
>>That’s not the talks I heard. I heard eu offered 0 for 0 and Trump denied unless they also agreed to adhere to our regulation standards as well. And that’s a fair ask. By all means, please explain global trade to me. I am all ears.
>>>Go to fucking college bro
>>>>The fact that instead of coming up with a coherent response, you insult me implies that you don’t know what you are talking about and you don’t understand the subject well enough to talk about it.  I’m making my case. You can dismantle it if it’s that easy to dismantle

>I'm not American and didn't vote for trump, I'm aussie and have never even voted, I know, I'm the worst. But isn't the whole point of democracy letting people, no matter how dumb vote their choice? People complain about voter turnout in america, then complain about half the people voting opposite to them. It's probably psychological, maybe given two choices a big enough crowd will naturally split down the middle, or maybe not lol who knows.
>>People have the right to vote for whoever they want. In the same regard, I have the right to tell them they voted for a rapist that gargles Putin's nuts and I think traitors deserve no grace whatsoever.  So yeah, democracy allows dumb people to vote. I'm not sure where I said they shouldn't vote. I simply said they are brain dead traitors which is my right with freedom of speech  In fact, I'm glad they vote. Its better that they let everyone know who they are.
>>>I get what you're saying , but if we start ostracising people for how they vote we'll end up with people afraid to vote how they feel. In my opinion, no matter the side, each side thinks if more people voted they'd vote for there side. But anyway I just don't care enough about politics, but I care about regular people having the freedom to choose and not be judged. Maybe I should vote one day, but I wont.
>>>>""if we start ostracising people for how they vote we'll end up with people afraid to vote how they feel""  People that vote for traitors who ran on ruining everyone's lives deserve to be ostracized. No tolerance for the intolerant

[Unpopular opinion here. There are the exact people we need to recruit to the left. They’ve been wronged by their god king and are emotionally vulnerable.  Right now being kind to another person who is hurting just as much as you or I is what we need to get him to our side. We mustn’t forget our or others humanity in the coming dark times. We as a society need to pull together with our communities and do something  Addendum: Too all of those “nah fuck em” kids.

>It's just that he's shown who he is for so long now, he's had so much proven illegality and shady dealings in the past, he had a first term where he demonstrated multiple times what kind of leader he is and he laid out his plans and goals pretty clearly in the campaign (as did the people behind P2025).  If someone can only see what is happening now after they've been personally affected when it's too late to undo the immense damage already caused it's really hard to open up your heart and have empathy. Our society is badly fractured and we still have a ways to fall I fear.
>>Yeah totally valid thoughts and feelings. While I stand by what I said, it’s important to remember these things when it comes to trump voters. I think we still need to treat them as humans, but not forget what they did. However we do need to let people move past the person they do t want to be, and give them the opportunity to do so contiguously.
>>>No. Just no. No to everything you said. These people are *cancer*.
>>>>So what, you're going to genocide them?
>>>>>lmao what?


[Well it is a problem. I know this isn't a popular stance, but if we the left demonized them for ""fuck your feelings,"" we need to do better and be better. It sucks, but doing the right thing sometimes does. Showing compassion and empathy to those affected won't be fun, but its necessary if we are to move forward now that the other shoe is dropping for some of these folks.

>So rather than responding to different points, engaging in the conversation, and so on, you decide to add a snarky edit then bounce?  How does that move anything forward?
>>Yes.  The people responding to me, outside maybe you, as you can see, aren't looking for a conversation.  They are looking to enjoy this guy being upset, read posts about FAFO or leopards, get more enjoyment, and move on. 99% of reddit isn't a place to have a discussion anymore.  It is well-defined and filtered pockets of control.  In some ways it is good, because people can commiserate and air grief about current events.   I accept that, just as I accept that saying what I said is not popular and won't be well received.  But why pretend that anybody came to the tiktokcringe subreddit to have a productive discussion on how we move on from the toxic adversarial climate the Republicans have created, and that the Democrats have slid right into and accepted?  That is essentially why I didn't respond to anyone but you.
>>>You received multiple non confrontational responses. There's no need to lie.  Your criticism is nothing but hypocritical.
>>>>If that's true, feel free to go ahead and respond to them.  Or we can just keep having a meta-conversation about how the conversation should be going.  I'm not ""lying.""  If you don't want to call a horse a horse I have no issue with that, but the original post is for schadenfreude, not productive discussion.  Despite that, I said my piece.  I still stand by it.  Show kindness and empathy, and remind even these people that it doesn't destroy you to care. Get your last well constructed insult or attack in, because I'm out.

I'm a 25-year-old boy who's somewhere between “has his life together” and “double-checks simple things just to be sure.” I’m here hoping to stumble across someone who’s down for real connection — the kind with inside jokes, vulnerable talks at 2am, and sending each other weird memes like a love language.

A little about me:

\- I’ve got a job I enjoy, (I work as a Video Editor for a Youtube channel).

\- Emotionally available, introspective, and probably too self-aware for my own good.

\- I'm big into philosophy — not in a ""quoting Nietzsche to sound deep"" kind of way, but more like ""let's unpack our childhood traumas and talk about existence over coffee at 1am.""

\- Movies are my comfort zone. From slow-burn A24 stuff to chaotic thrillers to deep, emotionally gut-punching dramas, I love getting lost in a good story. If you’ve ever cried over a movie character like they were real, you get me.

\- I like deep convos, absurd humor, psychology, long walks (mentally or literally), and trying to understand this strange experience called being human.

\- Basically, I'm just a curious mind wrapped in a cozy hoodie with access to decent WiFi.

What I’m looking for:  
I don’t have a long checklist, but I vibe best with women who are emotionally intelligent, compassionate, and open to sharing their perspectives (even if they differ from mine — I love hearing new angles on things). Some shared interests are cool but not required — just be someone who’s thoughtful, understanding, and can handle some playful sarcasm and occasional philosophical spirals.

Long distance? Totally cool with me. Let’s just start by talking and see where it goes. No pressure to jump into anything — I’m more interested in the *c*onnection than a rushed label.

Bonus points if you:

\- Like voice notes more than paragraphs  
\- Have a favorite comfort show or rewatch the same movie like it’s therapy.  
\- Can roast me just enough to keep me humble

If any of this sounds like your jam, slide into my DMs with your favorite movie, quote, or a random deep thought you’ve had lately. Worst case? We exchange a few good memes. Best case? We’re planning a cute video date with snacks and an overly analyzed movie night.

I'm happy to do 50/50 English and French to help you with your English as well!

Planning to go public and tell line manager. My thinking is I do this to protect myself and to get help to achieve more of what I'm capable of. A very supportive workplace / company with an employee resource group for neurodiversity. I work with at least one with ADHD, actually ASD as well. So work will support in their interest which should coincide with mine too.

So my enquiry here is what is the reason and intended outcome of telling people? Whether work or personal contracts. What is your view on this? Your reasons? 

I'm thinking work is to get back to more WFH as 4 days in a bit office is not to my long and doesn't suit my working. I'm not a coffee cooler chat mind if guy and people just distract. They move, they talk and they banter. My head's looking up and around so much I feel possessed! 

Also, structure or means to get structure. Two things, toolsets (no idea what but time management, project management, etc) and structure from line manager.

This last one is hitting me hard this year. My work kind of runs for a year then gets changed on terms of focus for the next due to the body of work I do. This year I have no structure to follow with this.

I need to see the end (mountain top). I need to see the path up the mountain to the top. I need the challenge of the mountain. Right now I'm not seeing the summit, the path or the mountain (no direction, end in sight or even challenge / interest).

But I just don't see how this is to be done so I do not know why I'm telling them. If that makes sense because it does sound from what I've typed I know what I need / want, but I don't understand it all. As in what the company can do. They can't give me a new job, although I am keeping my eye out for a new role in the organisation for a side shift into a better team for me. 

So basically looking for thoughts on reasons to tell work or family or indeed anyone.",2,1744489684.0,ADHDUK,7,1.0,False

I'm using stacked bell to build the movement back up. There's way more of a stability demand doing the bup this way.

Second clip double snatches with a pair of 24kgs - I find outside the legs on the back swing (or 50/50 in & out as shown at the end of the set) much more challenging than having the bells both swing between the legs as is the usual manner of training the movement.

I realized today I need to do something when I was at the mall by myself and circled the food court for 30 minutes trying to work up the courage to order lunch, but there’s a lot more to it then that.

First of all, I went from living in a university dorm to living in his house, I’ve never lived alone, rented or paid bills except car payments/insurance for my first car. 

I’m really good at home alone, but the second I step out of the house I get overwhelmed and panicked. I feel really stupid a lot of the time too, a store will say it’s open but I will walk around the block for 20 minutes and wait for someone else to go in because I’m scared, unless I’m with my fiancé. I just feel like I don’t know how to do anything

Leaving the house without him I feel like I need to check every outlet 100 times and every door 100 times to make sure it’s locked.. I will literally lock the door, get in my car, go back, get in the car, go back. My fiancé will literally text me from work saying the door is looked because I set off the camera checking so many times. If I’m with him and he locks it I don’t worry at all or even think about it


I really need to become more independent but I don’t know how to start, it honestly seems like the more I push myself the worse I get because if I push myself to do something and make a mistake it sets me back. 

I can do the things in my regular routine though, so I’m wondering if I just need to start adding things to my routine? Like I walk from our house to erewhon (grocery store) or the farmers market, and will stop at my coffee shop just fine but won’t go to any shops I haven’t been to. But anyways, I do fine on that route in my regular shops, go to a mall I’ve never been to and I’m too scared to enter any stores 


I also should have included part of my problem is I grew up in an abusive household. I never know what’s right or wrong socially because I got screamed at for everything under the sun as a kid. Im so afraid of any mistake because if I made one then it was hell on earth.. but I do see a therapist for those issues lol",1,1744489412.0,Adulting,6,0.67,False

I don’t know if I should confront him or not?","My boyfriend, M35, and I, F33, have been together for about 4 years now and I’ve never really had any serious trust issues with him. He’s not really the type to cheat or anything but because I’ve been cheated on in the past (not an excuse) I guess I still have that worry- even if it’s very very minimal with him. 

Now on to the story (I’m going to be pretty vague since I want to keep this as anonymous as possible)

So the other day, my bf and his friend were hanging out, working on some projects at our house. My bf asked if I could take some BTS pictures so I said of course and started taking pictures with his phone. While I was taking pictures, he got a notification from Instagram. His previews are on so I was able to see who it was from and what was said. It was from a girl named Rachel that used to work at a coffee shop my bf and I would frequent. 

I noticed about 6ish months ago that he followed her and I brought it up because I thought it was odd. My internal dialogue was “ How did he find her? Did he specifically search for her? How did he remember her name when I didn’t even remember? What’s the point of following her? “ you get the picture. When I asked him about it he said that he followed the coffee shops page and then she popped up as a suggested user to follow so he followed her and that’s all. I let him know that I thought it was weird and I wasn’t too happy about that. He asked if I wanted him to unfollow her but I told me no, it’s whatever. In reality, I would’ve appreciated that buuut I also don’t want to be the type of woman that asks or forces my bf to unfollow people. It feels very high school/immature and I don’t ever want to be that way.

Cut, to the other day when I saw the DM notification from this girl Rachel. All it said was “Thank you!! 🥳” so I assumed because of the emoji she used that it was her birthday and he must’ve reached out to her to say happy birthday, which to me is really weird. I wouldn’t go out of my way to follow or say happy birthday to a person I don’t even know. I know it’s pretty harmless in he bigger picture but still wasn’t sitting too well with me.


Side note: he’s done something like this before. A few years ago he was DM’ing a girl he knew from high school which made me uncomfortable. They were talking a lot and I felt like my boundaries were super close to being crossed. She had asked him to send her pictures of him at a show his band was playing and stuff like that which I was not super fond of. As I was reading these DM’s (secretly, which I am absolutely not proud of) over time, he all the sudden started deleting them. I knew that because the conversations wouldn’t make sense or it seemed like it would start in the middle of a conversation. Anyways, I got extremely suspicious after that, confronted him, he apologized and said that he started to feel like things were getting weird with her too and he didn’t want anything to do with her so that’s why he deleted the DM’s and unfollowed her, so that was that I guess. 


Anyways, I had a gut feeling that he was going to try and hide or delete the DM from this girl Rachel. So yesterday I decided to look and see if the DM was still there and lo and behold it was gone. He deleted it, which makes everything much more suspicious. I feel like the only reason you would delete texts or DM’s is because you know it’s wrong and/or inappropriate and don’t want anyone (your gf or bf) to see. If you had no other intentions then why would you hide it? 

Another side note, I did not read the full DM so I don’t know what more had been said, if anything more was actually said. All I saw was that initial “thank you” response from her. It had only been a few days in between the initial DM and when he deleted it so I’m not sure if they talked more.

In the grand scheme of things its not really a big deal for someone to say happy birthday and all that. I guess the actual issue isn’t what was said but the fact that he deleted the messages (especially because he’s already done that in the past).

Now, I just don’t know if should bring it up to him or leave it alone. Any suggestions?",0,1744489388.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

My parents have always offered to help us, but we never asked.  When they come over, we are usually having coffee and watching my son together.  

My wife and I took our son for a long trip, and we are really jet lagged.  We arrived last Wednesday and asked for them for help for the first time, they said they can't because they just started looking after my nephews while my sister goes on vacation with her husband until Monday.

I am annoyed, as we really need their help but okay.  My parents offer to come on Tuesday, and we accept.  Then a few hours later my wife is talking to my parents when they suddenly say they can't come Tuesday either because even though my sister is arriving on Monday, they might stay at my parents house until Tuesday afternoon.  

I understand it's not realistic for them to help since they have their hands full, but i am so annoyed.  My partner tried to calm me down but admitted she would react even more harshly than I did if her parents declined to help.

I would like to talk about a problem I had with my roasts taking longer than I wanted. After trying various gas and air settings, I decided that the responsible is that I cannot give enough energy.

My setup in my 5 Kg roaster is Gas Bottle → High Pressure Regulator → 30 mbar Output Regulator → Valve → Manometer → Gas Control Valve (inside machine) → Burner.

The manufacturer's recommended value for the high pressure regulator is 1-1.5 bar, but when I use it in these settings, my manometer makes a serious flicker between 20-30 mbar. At 0.3, this flicker is much less. I have experimented with two different 0-100 mbar and one 0-25 mbar manometer. I have tried disassembling and reconnecting the installation several times. Today I received advice that the gas control valve after the manometer can backpressure and I plan to try it. I think I can also benefit from your experience. Has anyone experienced this problem before? Any advice would be appreciated. Note: there is flickering in most trials but the intensity is between 20-30 mbar.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

1jxqdtv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxqdtv,Quick Mill Pop-Up Review - 4 months into my first ever machine,"During Black Friday of 2024, after extensive hemming and hawing of what I wanted my first machine to be, I pre-ordered the Quick Mill Pop-Up in black from idrinkcoffee for $857 (inc. tax). This Black Friday deal included two steaming pitchers, a vacuum bean canister, and a bag of beans. Since then, I have seen very light chatter regarding this machine both on this subreddit as well as home-barista, so I thought I would pitch in with my insights. It does seem like there is a significant market for a quick-to-temp, single boiler machine with built-in PID and flow control for consumers like myself who do not wish to bother modding a more established machine; several users have requested this type of review, so hopefully this will be useful for them at least.

  
**Fit/Finish**

Prior to purchasing, I did quite a lot of research regarding my options. When I came across the announcement of this new machine, I mostly focused my research on the overall QC/longevity of Quick Mill products, and I found most first-hand accounts to be positive. With my machine in particular, there are a lot of positives for a sub-$1000 machine - great alignment on buttons/display features/steam knob. There are some precision issues with the way the drip tray and the cup heating platform/rails were fabricated, but I honestly could not care less about these rather aesthetic issues. The biggest ""issue"" with this unit is that the group head was installed in a way where the portafilter is not straight perpendicular to the machine when fully locked in - as in, even fully torquing down the portafilter will result in an angle of approx. 10-20deg from a perpendicular midline to the left when looking down at the machine. Again, I have had no functional issues with this particular issue, and from what I have seen in other Youtube reviews, other units have not had this issue. It does not bug me much, and I really did not want to deal with returning/replacing this unit through idrinkcoffee, so this little idiosyncrasy lives on.

  
**Temperature Control/Stability**

  
This is probably the most contentious section, because I have not tested the accuracy of the PID with a thermometer, and frankly cannot be bothered to do so (lol). My machine boldly proclaims that the water temp is up to 93C within the first minute of me turning on the machine. Even as a fanboy of my little guy, I just have a hard time believing this is accurate in any way; considering the fact that if I pull a blank shot right after it ""gets to temp"" and it shows low 70's right after, I would definitely wait at least 5-7 minutes to let it really come up to temp. However, I will concede that even this short timeframe of 5-7 minutes is going to be satisfactory for most consumers looking into this range of machine. I really do not think this is a long enough time to warrant getting a ""smart plug"", but one could certainly do so at one's pleasure. After I pull a shot, I always pull a blank, clean the grouphead with a towel, and then turn on the steam mode. You can program the steam temp to whatever you want (of course the temp of the group head water as well), but I am sticking with the default temp for now. It takes approx. 40-50 sec from brew temp to get to full steam temp. I always purge the steam wand when it reaches about 120C or so before it gets to full temp. The steam power and quality coming from a two-hole tip is very adequate, if not downright robust.

  
**Dialing In/Espresso Quality/Other Considerations**

  
As a novice home espresso maker, it took me at least a good two months to really even figure out if the espresso I was pulling was comparable to ""shop quality"". Initially, my shots were pulling very quickly (18g in:36g out at around 20-22 sec). Then, I decided to do that one secret trick that literally nobody talks about on this sub - I ground my beans finer. Now, to be fair, I started off sort of on the deep end with some kookier beans from Proud Mary (my go-to for pour overs), and dialing in the right amount of pre-infusion, grind size, dosage, was all just SO MUCH for a scrub like myself. Eventually, about three weeks ago, I finally started pulling shots that I was legitimately impressing myself with. For reference, the cafes I am comparing my coffee to include: Dune, Stereoscope, Go Get 'Em Tiger, Maru, Narrative, and Milstead & Co.

  
The clearance between the drip tray and the group head is expectedly minimal; the machine comes with a double sprouted PF that I would consider basically unusable if brewing with a scale. Even with a small scale (Tinemore Mini) and a bottomless PF, I can barely squeeze in a cup no more than 3in in height. The lever for the pressure profiling is kind of oddly shaped but functional. I feel like they could have engineered a better solution if there was some kind of elbow to it, but it works fine as it is, and I am guessing this basic type of lever is baked in to the low price of the unit. Finally, the clearance of the steam wand is also not great. My machine is set up so that the right edge is flush with the edge of my workbench, and I steam my milk with the pitcher completely in space away from the bench.

**Overall Recommendation**

  
Let me just get this out of the way - I do not believe there is a competitor machine with the same features in this small of a footprint for sub-$1000 at the moment. With the incoming tariff wars looming, it seems prices will only increase as well with the majority of these imported machines. For the price I paid, I am extremely happy with what I received. I think from what I have heard from others trying to buy this machine now, it is approaching $1100+, and that would definitely put it back in the ""eh I'll think about it"" category rather than the ""slam dunk choice"" category. There are two considerations with regard to longevity of the machine: 1. I am already operating under the assumption I will receive little to no product support/maintenance assistance from Quick Mill and 2. I am already operating under the assumption I will receive warranty support from idrinkcoffee. Basically, I bought the thing and now it's my problem until it no longer functions. I am comfortable with those two assumptions if the machine is sub-$1000, but if not, then it would definitely be a consideration.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact.

I barely raised my dose at all- I used the liquid to titrate up very slowly because I am so sensitive.

So i guess its called spirituality. First this kind of thought came to me when i almost died of acid poisoning becouse of type 1 diabetes. I went to a bench near the hospital to smoke a cigarette and thought of how much id rather be at my grandmoms place at the country side. I saw clearly the image of my veteran greatgrandfather who survived the war and then a large raven landed right next to me. It looked at me like yeah? you called. Started to approach me as if i had something for it to eat. It was him! Few years go by without anything too out standing and then i gained a new ability. My insanity or ""powers"" grow stronger the longer i stay awake without sleeping. At the +35h mark i start to see things without thinking or imagining them. I see them very clearly and they are beautiful, i regret not recording a discription of them right as they started. Anyway so i take a sleeping pill and try to fall a sleep. The images can be very scary but i somehow know nothing bad can happen. I think of it as an ability that is different each and every time. So in my manic episode i masturbated with my toys for 2 days straight for a relief that lasts maybe 30 minutes and then i need it again. Yestreday i decided to go out just to get some fresh air. A group of 3 young men greet me at the wheelbarrow. I join them and as we get to the bar and i sit to the table. There she is, a girl i, not even kidding, sent a friend request on facebook like 2 weeks before. We were in the same daytime activity six years ago. I call her to me, and she also remembers me but isnt sure from where. For a very small moment she appears very sad so i ask her if shes okay. She talks in a very small voice but i understand that no, not really. I get up from the table and ask her to come sit with me. She is georgeous and almost as something not from our world. She is really into me and is not able to hide it at all. She bites her lower lip like ive never seen noone else do and if i say somthing she really likes to hear she cant look at me and adjust her fringe.  We go get her a drink and sit on a couch. I ask her to come closer. Shes wearing a shirt that leaves the top of her stomach and back exposed. I start to stroke her as gently as i can and she visibly enjoys it. In one movemnt i put my hand into her pants and grab her panties. Shes ""unintentionally"" wearing a thong. I pull them straight up abit harder till she looks ready. She doesnt even finish her drink and we get out. I get her to my place and she is more than ready for what ever i want. But here is the part why i think i might be in a psychosis. My soldier with stamina training since the age of 9 and quit a bit of field experience. Can not do the deed. I get her off using other methods and we talk about anything and eveything to cross our minds. She is fine as fuck!!!! The ass is as if god flocked it just for me from the most nobel extraterrestrial wood and she has a 8 pack. We drank coffee and she had to go to her girlfriend birthday party. She told me she will come in the evening. She answered to me the for the last time at around 1 o'clock. Is the faith i will get? I find a woman who next to me i see no reason to fall asleep becouse not any dream could be better than the whole experience of her being there. If she doesnt answer soon i will for real go search for her until i have no choise but to give up. Probaly will smoke a pack of cigarettes and say fuck it. Ill go get something to make this into a full blown psychosis. I will try to make something that i can show a nother person out of what i might be shown. Ladies and playboys!

[The List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZuHYUPIuBgPLQdOlhvAUGxHHFOTM3ltTu-k95DsGbbc/edit?usp=sharing)

* I can't guarantee any of these places are still open or exactly the same as when we ranked them. We only just digitized this after having it written on paper for years. 
* We did not have any special method for picking locations, so apologies if some areas of LA are not represented. We mostly went off of friend recommendations, different places we saw while driving, or googling.
* None of the people we usually went with drink alcohol, and so the scores don't account for how good that part of their menu is. 
* Beyond that, my partner has a dairy allergy, so we usually tried coffee options with normal milk and plant based milk. 
* I usually go for eggs benedict, a breakfast sandwich, breakfast burger, or some kind of hash. My partner almost always does waffles, french toast or pancakes. Others varied. Always coffee. Obsessed with good coffee.
* We didn't include major chains, but did include places with more than one location which is reflected as ""Various"" on the sheet.
* Criteria considered: Food quality but also food selection and variety. I am a pretty good cook so I usually look for things I couldn't just easily make at home. Can you get savory or sweet etc. Sometimes location and service quality had an impact as well. Price was also sometimes a factor.

My issue is that you had to reclaim all those you had left in like 2 weeks or lose whatever you had left lol. The last day was March 24th and and the claim deadline was April 9th. I am just pissed because I just assumed you had a month to claim the prizes because that seemed the most logical and common sense thing to do ( I never read the rules & regs because I'm not a dork), but I went to Florida for 2 weeks March 27th (so basically 3 days after the contested closed) and when I came back I come to find out that my 20ish digital coffees are gone now ffs.

I’d like to share my current situation with you. I’m Peruvian and based in South America. Peru is one of the largest exporters of agro-industrial products in the region — meaning that many of the fruits, vegetables, coffee, or teas you consume in your country might actually come from here.

As an entrepreneur, I currently have access to very attractive pricing on coffee and tea — ideal for anyone with a distribution network or looking to build their own private label brand (white label) online. I also offer established brands of both coffee and tea.

Let me share a bit of information about these ventures. I usually don’t use social media much, but I’m now looking for ways to bring high-quality Peruvian products to more parts of the world. These products are truly premium — pure flavor, guaranteed quality.

Additionally, I can help source other Peruvian agro-industrial products such as **cacao, pisco** (a strong traditional Peruvian spirit), **blueberries**, or **asparagus**, depending on your needs.

👉 **My main question is simpl**e:  
Is there anyone here with a distribution network or interest in developing a private label for high-quality agro-industrial products?

Here are links to the current brands:

If any member happens to be genuinely interested in this topic, I’d be more than happy to have a proper conversation and share more details privately.

Please note that we source products **directly from the harvest**, with **no middlemen**, meaning better pricing and more control. I hope this message reaches someone interested in building something solid and meaningful.",1,1744488726.0,businessnetworking,2,1.0,False

I'm a 25-year-old boy who's somewhere between “has his life together” and “double-checks simple things just to be sure.” I’m here hoping to stumble across someone who’s down for real connection — the kind with inside jokes, vulnerable talks at 2am, and sending each other weird memes like a love language.

A little about me:

\- I’ve got a job I enjoy, (I work as a Video Editor for a Youtube channel). 

\- Emotionally available, introspective, and probably too self-aware for my own good.

\- I'm big into philosophy — not in a ""quoting Nietzsche to sound deep"" kind of way, but more like ""let's unpack our childhood traumas and talk about existence over coffee at 1am.""

\- Movies are my comfort zone. From slow-burn A24 stuff to chaotic thrillers to deep, emotionally gut-punching dramas, I love getting lost in a good story. If you’ve ever cried over a movie character like they were real, you get me.

\- I like deep convos, absurd humor, psychology, long walks (mentally or literally), and trying to understand this strange experience called being human.

\- Basically, I'm just a curious mind wrapped in a cozy hoodie with access to decent WiFi.

What I’m looking for:   
I don’t have a long checklist, but I vibe best with women who are emotionally intelligent, compassionate, and open to sharing their perspectives (even if they differ from mine — I love hearing new angles on things). Some shared interests are cool but not required — just be someone who’s thoughtful, understanding, and can handle some playful sarcasm and occasional philosophical spirals.

Long distance? Totally cool with me. Let’s just start by talking and see where it goes. No pressure to jump into anything — I’m more interested in the *c*onnection than a rushed label.

Bonus points if you:

\- Like voice notes more than paragraphs  
\- Have a favorite comfort show or rewatch the same movie like it’s therapy.  
\- Can roast me just enough to keep me humble

If any of this sounds like your jam, slide into my DMs with your favorite movie, quote, or a random deep thought you’ve had lately. Worst case? We exchange a few good memes. Best case? We’re planning a cute video date with snacks and an overly analyzed movie night.

Looking forward to hearing from someone cool (is it you? 👀)",1,1744488681.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
