Hi everyone,

I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. üôÇ

I have been dissolving half a teaspoon of baking soda in a cup of water (a standard coffee cup), and been rinsing my mouth.

basically after making a drink one day, my Linea Mini's steam wand stopped working, and the steam boiler isn't showing any bars of pressure even after being on for an hr. App says everything's fine, I opened up the machine and hit the reset button for the steam boiler which seemed to have tripped, it clicked, won't click again when pressing it, but the pressure still stays at 0. Suspect the steam boiler, and so I'm planning on testing with a multimeter according to [https://support.clivecoffee.com/en/la-marzocco-gs/3-steam-boiler-electrical](https://support.clivecoffee.com/en/la-marzocco-gs/3-steam-boiler-electrical) .

  
The last thing I did before that last drink was to change the temperature PID from 205 to 185 F, (and swapped to the IoT board earlier in the week), but not sure if either of these two are related (but worth double checking just in case). 

Anything else I should check for in this process?

EXPECTO... PAAAAAAATROOOOOOOOOOOONUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!! Alright, \[NOSTALGIA CANAGLIA\] can affect the enemy as much as the user doesn't use the Joestar's secret technique and runs away like NIGERUNDAYOOOOOOO or kills the enemy stealthly, smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover (i know you sang it). 

\[NOSTALGIA CANAGLIA\] is an italian song sang by Albano Carrisi, and it's about past memories, so it's the ability, i make powers or weaknesses inspired by the meanings of the songs, like \[VIBRELLO\] is an italian trash song by Gemboy about a vibrator and it's ability is to vibe and electroshock people for example. 

\[NOSTALGIA CANAGLIA\] is a psychological stand like \[WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN\] but it's not that OP... it's more like a family friendly stand that makes you live happy moments of your life by making your mind get lost in your memories, allucinating you, distracting you... and i thought that \[NOSTALGIA CANAGLIA\] could be GORGEOUS GEORGE VALENTINE'S NEW STAND, son of Pancetta and Funny Valentine (it's cursed i know) seen that Gorgeous is much more chill than his mom, he is much more chill than any other JoJo character, he's the kind of a man who shakes your hand then gives you coffee, hugs you... he talks to you, he gets along with people, he is safe around children, he is like an angel believed to be a bitch... so \[TOXIC\] as his stand doesn't make sense... even if my main OC doesn't make sense... but it's another story...

1hx7spl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hx7spl,Explosion on first try out of the box,"So, I finally went and bought a moka pot the other day, 6 cup Bialetti from Target. Bought a canister of the illy grounds after I had seen them recommended online multiple times. Super excited to give it a try, knew all the steps from reading online and from friends, felt pretty confident in my first attempt. 

I go to pop open the new container of coffee grounds and somehow it‚Äôs pressurized, so coffee grounds go shooting two feet up in the air and raining down on my kitchen counters/floors and anything else in a three foot radius. This honestly was foreshadowing and I should‚Äôve stopped right here. 

So, I get everything assembled, grounds are in (not tamped), water is below the valve, set my burner to low-med heat, and left my lid open to watch the magic happen. After a few minutes, it starts to steam/leak out of the middle where the top and bottom connect and screw together. Twisted it just a hair tighter and then put it back on the burner to see if that helped. It was still leaking a little bit, but I figured it will stop eventually and all will be good.

Well everything was far from good. In that next minute, my moka pot decides to spew hot burnt coffee ground lava all over my kitchen. Thankfully I didn‚Äôt get burned in the process, but now I‚Äôm just in shock with a humongous mess to clean up. 

I start troubleshooting while cleaning all this up. Thinking about the coarseness of my grounds, how tight I put it together, is my pressure valve broken? Nothing is really making sense. I‚Äôm looking at manuals online, my box has already been thrown in the trash unfortunately in my excitement a few days prior, so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm missing a crucial step or a part. 

Come to find out, my moka pot is actually missing a rather important part. The rubber ring seal and the filter part that goes in the top half of this concoction so that when it‚Äôs screwed together, it will work properly. So now after cleaning up two big messes and having an apartment that smells like burnt coffee for days, my replacement parts are on the way and I will be making an attempt once again to make this thing work.

She‚Äôs been consistently committed to F45 workouts, and I‚Äôm fully supportive of her efforts. While she occasionally counted calories and nutrients, she‚Äôs stopped doing so, and her weight and fat loss have plateaued. She‚Äôs never been consistent with her diet for more than two months. Even when she was counting calories, she refused to give up her sugary 200-calorie coffee with creamer, despite her app (MyFitnessPal) highlighting its high sugar content.

She‚Äôs been open about her frustrations and has been considering cosmetic surgery. I‚Äôve always been on board with her idea, acknowledging that having a baby can be tough on a woman‚Äôs body and that cosmetic surgery might be an option. I want her happy, but I recognize the financial and potential risks involved.

However, my concern is that even with cosmetic surgery, if her habits don‚Äôt change, it‚Äôll be a temporary fix. I‚Äôd hate for her to be unhappy if she regained the weight after surgery. I suggested that she meet with a personal trainer and dietitian, preferably a woman and a mom. But she refuses, pouting at the idea and dismissing the expense. My hope was that a female professional would provide her with a perspective that she‚Äôd listen to and trust. For a long time, my wife was one of those girls who avoided lifting weights because she feared getting ‚Äúbulky‚Äù.

My hope is that a dietitian and personal trainer, especially a woman/mom, would dispel many of the ‚Äúmyths‚Äù she holds about fitness and potentially offer solutions before and after she undergoes expensive surgery.

She‚Äôs very pretty, and I‚Äôm happy with her, but I don‚Äôt feel unreasonable to suggest that she get a personal trainer and dietitian if we‚Äôre going to pay for cosmetic surgery. I feel like I upset her by the idea but I feel strongly about it given the expense to our family. I want to do right by her and I want her to be the glowing confident girl I love.

# Who is this for?

This information is ideal for anyone planning to purchase a diamond, especially for engagement rings or special occasions. It's particularly useful for buyers who want to understand all aspects of diamond quality beyond just carat weight.

# Who is this not for?

This may not be as relevant for buyers primarily focused on carat size without concern for overall aesthetic quality. It's also less crucial for those purchasing diamond simulants or other gemstones.

# Recommendations for smart buying:

1. Prioritize polish grades of Good or better for visually appealing diamonds.
2. Use magnification tools provided by online retailers to inspect diamond surfaces.
3. Consider the balance between polish grade and price ‚Äì Excellent polish may increase cost by 10-12%.
4. Don't overlook other important factors like cut quality and symmetry.
5. Request certification from reputable labs like GIA or AGS to verify polish grades.

# FAQ: Diamond Polishing

Q: What exactly is diamond polishing?

A: It's the process of refining a diamond's surface using a wheel coated with diamond powder to create a smooth, reflective finish on each facet.

Q: How much does polish grade affect a diamond's price?

A: The difference between Excellent and Very Good polish can impact price by about 10-12%, but it's less significant than factors like cut or clarity.

Q: Can I see polish flaws with the naked eye?

A: Usually not. Most polish flaws are microscopic and require at least 10x magnification to detect.

Q: Is it worth paying extra for Excellent polish?

A: It depends on your priorities. For most buyers, Good or Very Good polish is sufficient for a beautiful diamond. Excellent polish might be worth it for perfectionists or high-end purchases.

Q: Can a diamond be repolished if it gets scratched?

A: Yes, diamonds can be repolished to remove minor surface damage, but this process will result in a slight loss of carat weight.

Remember, while polish is important, it's just one aspect of a diamond's overall quality. Consider it alongside other factors to find the best diamond for your needs and budget.

Montmartre. Just the name conjures images of bohemian artists, charming cafes, and breathtaking views.  This iconic Parisian hilltop neighborhood is more than just a postcard; it's a living, breathing experience waiting to be explored.  So grab your beret (optional, but encouraged!), and let's embark on a delightful stroll through Montmartre.

**Getting There:** The easiest way to reach Montmartre is by taking the Metro to Abbesses (line 12) ‚Äì the station itself is a work of art! From there, it's a pleasant uphill walk, immersing you in the neighborhood's charm immediately.

**The Artists' Square (Place du Tertre):** This is the heart of Montmartre's artistic soul.  Hundreds of artists display their work ‚Äì from vibrant paintings to intricate sketches and quirky sculptures.  While some are undeniably talented, others are more‚Ä¶ commercial.  It's a fun place to browse, chat with the artists, and perhaps even commission a portrait.  Just be prepared to haggle politely ‚Äì it's all part of the fun!

**Wandering the Cobblestone Streets:**  Get lost!  Seriously, the best way to experience Montmartre is to simply wander its charming, winding cobblestone streets.  Discover hidden courtyards, stumble upon quaint boutiques, and soak up the unique atmosphere.  Don't be afraid to veer off the main paths ‚Äì that's where the real magic happens.

**Charming Caf√©s:**  Montmartre is a caf√© lover's paradise.  From traditional bistros to trendy brasseries, there's a spot for every taste and budget.  Grab a coffee, a glass of wine, or a delicious pastry and people-watch.  Many cafes offer outdoor seating, providing perfect vantage points for soaking in the atmosphere.  Just be mindful of the prime locations which can command higher prices.

**The Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica:**  The majestic Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica crowns the hilltop, offering panoramic views of Paris that are simply breathtaking.  The basilica itself is stunning, both inside and out.  It‚Äôs free to enter and explore, and the climb to the top is well worth the effort (or you can take the funicular).   Arrive early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid the largest crowds and truly appreciate the magnificent architecture and the stunning vista.

**Tips for your Montmartre adventure:**

* **Wear comfortable shoes:**  You'll be doing a lot of walking uphill!
* **Be aware of pickpockets:**  Like any popular tourist destination, be mindful of your belongings.
* **Bring your camera:**  You'll want to capture all the beauty!
* **Allow plenty of time:**  Montmartre is best explored at a leisurely pace.
* **Embrace the unexpected:**  Let yourself get lost and discover hidden gems.

Montmartre offers a unique blend of art, history, and charm.  It's a place where creativity thrives, and the atmosphere is infectious.  So, ditch the itinerary and let yourself be swept away by the magic of this iconic Parisian neighborhood.  Enjoy your stroll!

This is the fourth time my dad has absolutely ruined my life. 

I‚Äôm being melodramatic and throwing a pity party but I need to speak my truth that I don‚Äôt dare say to anyone out loud. 

The first time he ruined my life was when he decided to have a baby with my crack addicted mother who had no interest in being my mom and never was. He should‚Äôve figured that out, considering she was almost 40, wanted an abortion, did crack while she was pregnant with me, and already had two grown kids that were raised by other people from birth because she was incapable of doing so herself. But his desire to have a child/not be ‚Äòresponsible‚Äô for a fetus being aborted was more important than reality. 

The second time was when he decided to remarry a woman (my stepmom) he‚Äôd been married to 20 years prior that treated him like dirt (both times they were married) and then proceeded to physically and emotionally abuse him, me, and her own three children, despite one of them being physically disabled, and do nothing to divorce her to save himself or save me. That woman stripped me naked and paraded me in front of our household to punish me. She locked me in closets. She fucking poured freshly brewed coffee over my head when I was 8 years old because I dared to get up out of bed to get water. And he did nothing. Just threw himself a fucking pity party when she eventually left and bankrupted him. 

The third time was when he decided that his response to my depression and anxiety as a teen after my stepmom divorced him was to prescribe and supply me alcohol and marijuana, at 14 fucking years old. I deal with addiction to this day, and while I know I‚Äôm my own person and responsible for my choices and actions, unlike him, in this moment I am pissed the fuck off at him for that. 

The fourth time was when he decided to spend 12 years after the divorce from my stepmom self medicating with marijuana and alcohol, ensuring that he had dementia by 65, so that I had to find him half dead on the floor, put my entire fucking life on hold, drag his dog‚Äôs dead body out of his house, and move him in with me and MY beautiful family, who doesn‚Äôt fucking deserve to have to put up with this shit. Take care of him (which is a 24/7 fucking job) and clean his shit off my toilets and walls and argue with him about how much alcohol and marijuana he can consume while living with my husband and my stepson and my 1.5 year old daughter, who, despite living ten minutes away from me, he‚Äôd met a total of five times in the last year and a half. Before he moved in with us two weeks ago. And then he complains that she does normal toddler things, like cry. And whine. Because she‚Äôs a toddler. And that‚Äôs what she does. 

I don‚Äôt need to be told. I‚Äôm sure by my post history that anyone can see that I‚Äôm unfolding. Yes he needs to go into a facility. And yes he will. But at this moment, right now, he is still in my house, being a stubborn, selfish addict, and dementia ridden, so I can‚Äôt lash out on him without feeling guilty. So instead I‚Äôm venting. Fuck this guy. Fuck his selfishness. Fuck the absolute hell he‚Äôs put me through. He‚Äôs no father. He‚Äôs a parasite. I don‚Äôt want to take care of him. Sometimes I wish I‚Äôd listened to him when I found him on the floor, and left him there. In that one moment, he was absolutely right. I should‚Äôve just fucking walked away, because I do have my own family to worry about, and he told me that and I didn‚Äôt listen. I tried to do the right, moral thing, instead. I should‚Äôve fucking left him there.

I‚Äôve tried a few of their cakes and the matcha latte before, and everything has been great! While it can be a bit pricey, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it because the quality truly delivers.

Like why psychiatry and not neurology, for instance? Or if you care about clinical work related to mental health, then why not drop out and become a psychologist, professional counselor, clinical social worker, and so on? I think about loans, time commitment, and the lifestyle I want. Sure psychiatry pays better and is more secure than most careers in mental health but is it a right fit for me? How did you decide if psychiatry was the right fit for you?

One way I have tried to make a decision is by looking at the nature of work, values, goals, and people's personalities in psychiatry compared to people in other areas of mental health. Just to give an example, I've noticed social workers care more about social justice than many psychologists or psychiatrists.

I've wanted to sort of talk to psychiatrists to get a feel for what kind of people they are and what they care about, but I've had access to a very small sample in real life. And I was unable to post r/psychiatry as a med student. What I've noticed though is that they are generally more easygoing and friendly but also more cautious than the surgeons I've met.

Yet I've read about psychiatrists being closer to cops in terms of dealing with potentially dangerous and aggressive people (severe addiction, psychosis), especially way more compared to clinical psychologists or professional counselors. Which is appropriate because you can't do talk therapy with these patients until they've been properly medicated. Yet the fact that they report high career satisfaction and seem so relaxed despite the work they do makes me think they must have surprisingly high stress tolerance, and I doubt I have that. Sure, technically if I survive residency, then I can do private practice with garden variety anxiety and depression with low-risk patients, but that's a big if.

Things would have been much simpler if I didn't care about the biology of mental illness. Then med school would have been wrong. Yet, although I think many people's problems are related to societal factors (poverty, racism) and upbringing and all that, but it's one's perception of thing, and that is shaped by the brain. So nutrition, sleep, medications, vitamins and supplements, all these things can change one's perception of things.

1hx7ehs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1hx7ehs/an_amazing_experience/,An amazing experience ,"I was in need of a new Bible and some new fun reads. So armed with my Christmas gift card to Barnes & Noble, off to the bookstore my fiance and I went. We got a coffee and perused the store. I found three books that looked interesting and off to the Bible section we went. 

Now, I must mention that we are living in the southern United States, and not close to a military base or major city. So Catholic Churches and other Catholics are few and far between. And the last time I needed a new Bible back in 2016 (water damage due to leaking roof took out that one) my semi-local B&N didn't have any, only KJV to be found. I inadvertently got an employee fired because I dared to disagree with her statements that the KJV was the ""true"" Bible and that ""y'all Catholic people"" were going to burn in hell for worshipping ""those saint people."" I didn't even go to the manager as he'd walked up behind her while she was screaming at me. That was an interesting day, and I got my Bible for free and overnighted to my home. 

Anyway, back to present day. I was delighted to find a small, yet diverse, collection of NSRV/Catholic Bibles! I immediately locked on to one that came in a box. It was stunning and contains over 500 pictures from a 16th century Venetian Bible. There was a younger gentleman also shopping for a Bible, and he laughed along with my fiance when he opened the one I wanted and me being me said, ""Ohhh look! It's got PICTURES!"" 

However, it was $80. I only had $100 to spend so I told my fiance to wait there while I put two of the three fun reads I'd selected back. The young man, mid to late 20s maybe, said, ""I'm sorry, did you just say you were going to put your books back to get this?"" I replied that yes, I was, but it's ok because they'll be there the next time I come in. 

And that's when he offered to buy it for me. I was shocked. We both tried to decline because while incredibly generous, that's a lot of money. 

That's when he told us that he was very recently finding his way back to God. Only in the last year had he begun his journey. He told us where he grew up, he'd attended a Southern Baptist Church with only what he called ""Sunday only Christians."" 

I asked him why he was shopping for his own Catholic Bible since he's been raised on the KJV and he told us that he'd heard there were more books in our version and wanted to know what had been left out. He was also very curious about what Mass was and why he'd always heard we worshiped Saints and Mary and bc of that we were all going to hell. 

So we had a conversation with him about why we choose to remain Catholic. And answered those questions. And we accepted his amazing gift.

1hx7dgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hx7dgv/th_the_apartment/,[TH] The Apartment,"	It was cold in Tim‚Äôs apartment. The cool, musty Seattle air blowing in through his window brought in smells from across the city that made him feel equal parts nostalgic and nauseous. This city had taken everything from him. His wife, his job, his money, everything. Tim sat on his couch, staring at the Colt 1851 Navy Revolver on his coffee table. Was he really about to do it? Was he seriously about to end it all? Tim sat there, thinking about all the ways he could go about this. Would he put the revolver in his mouth and blow his brains onto the ceiling ‚ÄòHeadfirst for Halos‚Äô style? Or would he just put the gun to the side of his head the way he‚Äôd seen in the movies so many times. Or maybe he‚Äôd frame his neighbor Kevin by creating a crime scene, throwing himself onto the table shattering glass everywhere, break the lock on his door, and then shoot himself in the stomach a few times until he finally landed the killing blow under his chin. Kevin always kept Tim awake at night by blasting Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit at maximum volume, but whenever a complaint was phoned in he‚Äôd always turn it down just long enough for the police to leave, but right after he‚Äôd turn it right back up. He also thought Amber Heard was innocent and that‚Äôs enough reason for someone to be framed for murder.



	Tim lifted up the revolver, weighing it in his hand. Agonizing in his misery, Tim wondered what brought him here. ‚ÄúWhy end it all when you could just move somewhere else, start anew, and leave this life behind?‚Äù Tim muttered to himself. ‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôd find you‚Äù, a voice called out to him. Shaken, Tim stood up and turned around, desperately trying to find the source of the voice, but no one was there. He was hearing things, Tim told himself, trying to ignore what he had unmistakably heard. What if someone really was in the apartment with him? Who could it be? Has someone really been there this whole time, watching, studying him, waiting for the perfect time to strike? Tim held the revolver out into the darkness. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù he shouted with fear. Only silence responded, maybe he was losing his mind after all. Tim pulled the trigger, hoping the ear shattering gunshot would make the intruder reveal himself. Again, only silence met him. Tim rushed over to the light switch, but just as he was about to turn it on, he felt a sharp, staggering pain in his shoulder. He turned around, and that‚Äôs when he saw the source of the voice. It was a tall, husky man with a mask over his face, holding a bloody knife in his left hand, and a crowbar in his right. Before Tim could say anything he felt the cold, blunt edge of the crowbar hit his head as he was knocked to the ground, everything collapsing to black as the taste of blood filled his mouth. As his vision faded to black, all he could see was the revolver he was just about to use to end his misery. Funny, now that his life was in danger, Tim no longer wished to end it all. As his blood seeped into the carpet and around his head, the only thought in Tim‚Äôs mind was his desire to see his daughter just one, last time. The man picked up the revolver, pulled back the hammer, and pulled the trigger.

1hx7bd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hx7bd9/no_one_was_there_cleaning/,No One was There Cleaning,"I work for a murder clean up company. No, not crime scene clean up, murder clean up; my company comes in after a call and clean the scene before it becomes a crime scene. If there‚Äôs ever been a murder reported or a missing person report but there‚Äôs no leads, no evidence, not even a body‚Ä¶ yeah, that‚Äôs us. The company was made official at the end of the 1800‚Äôs, after Jack the Ripper killed his seventh victim. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs only five,‚Äù I can hear you saying. To which I‚Äôll reply, ‚ÄúOnly five FOUND.‚Äù We‚Äôre good at our job; at hiding and disposing bodies, removing any physical evidence, such as blood, hair, fingerprints, murder weapon, and cleaning up the area to its previous, untainted state of pristine. It was as if nothing had ever happened, a doe would feel comfortable giving birth after our clean ups.

I‚Äôve seen quite a few different types of murders that people could only see in movies or on TV. People smothered by pillows, clothes, a teddy bear, people stabbed with knives, a hat pin, a fire poker. I once saw a person stabbed with a butter knife, in their ribs! The amount of force a person has to put behind a butter knife to penetrate skin and lodge itself between ribs, I may never want to know.

Now I'm sure you're wondering, with how dangerous this job could become, what with tampering with a crime scene, not reporting a crime, accomplice to a murder, how good is the pay? Well, the answer to that could only be one thing: if I die tomorrow, there would be fights over my estate. That is, if they found out I was dead. Minor clause in my contract, no big deal. I've worked at this job for a little over a year and, if it didn't raise any red flags, I could possibly purchase a four bedroom home with cash. But since this job isn‚Äôt technically legal, I can't make any extravagant purchases with my FAT STACKS!! Or put it in a bank since I'm ‚Äúunemployed.‚Äù Hell, my parents think I‚Äôm selling drugs or prostituting or something.

Now, enough about how amazing or difficult my career is, you didn't come for that story. You came for the story about the most unbelievable, incomprehensive, and down-right horrendous murder scene that I‚Äôve witnessed to date. And it didn‚Äôt even involve women or children. Just a single man and a single knife‚Ä¶ I think.
Let me paint you a picture. You‚Äôre sitting in what can only be described as a breakroom with who can only be described as your coworkers drinking what can only be described as coffee. You don't know his name, you don‚Äôt need to; names lead to companionship, and if you make friends with these coworkers, you feel bad when they leave‚Ä¶ or ‚Äúleave.‚Äù You're sipping your third cup of coffee, hoping that dark ambrosia will give you the strength needed to get through the rest of your shift. Your newest coworker, a kid, maybe nineteen, looks like he just walked in on his parents making a little brother, a horror on his face that you know will fade in a few calls. ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt think a senators murder/suicide would be that harrowing,‚Äô I thought but remembered, I was a new kid once too. I almost threw up at scene of a holocaust recreation in Kansas. I still shudder at the image of a four year old with their skin sloughing off from the chemical shower.

‚ÄúLook at it this way, ‚Äú I said, trying to calm him down. ‚ÄúAt least the kid looked legal.‚Äù

He just looked at me with a look of ‚ÄòWhat is wrong with you?‚Äô on his face before staring back down at his feet, probably trying to get the sound of sloshing blood out of his head.

The door swung open for our boss, a slightly overweight man with balding gray hair and a face to rival any drill sergeant. He looked at us with a straight face and said, ‚ÄúPanties up, ladies, you got a call.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe literally just got back,‚Äù I replied, a twinge of whining in my voice. ‚ÄúI just poured some coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I look like I'm paying you to sit on your ass, and make yourself pretty, soft-man!?‚Äù he replied, knowing full well how long we‚Äôve been back. He threw a wadded ball of paper at me, probably the info we‚Äôll need. ‚ÄúPanties! UP!‚Äù he shouted and slammed the door behind him. I swear, that door had been replaced at least six times after I came in. Not sure if that was a coincidence or just how he was but I try not to dwell on the structure of the building. If it came down, it wouldn‚Äôt be my fault.

‚ÄúWelp,‚Äù I sighed, standing slowly and downing the burning liquid of life and normalcy. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get going, new guy. The sooner we get this done, the sooner we can get another call.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there another job I can do here?‚Äù he asked, a hint of fear in his voice. ‚ÄúLike making coffee? Or cleaning the breakroom?‚Äù

I looked around the clean, empty room and asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs to clean?‚Äù There were literally only three tables and a handful of chairs, one table holding a new looking coffee maker that‚Äôs been here longer than I have.

‚ÄúWell, what about paperwork?‚Äù he asked, grasping at straws while he followed me to the van. ‚ÄúPlace like this must have plenty of paperwork.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the boss‚Äô job,‚Äù I replied flatly. I opened the door for him and gestured inside. ‚ÄúCome on, kid. In and out, two hours max.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo?‚Äù he gasped, buckling in.

‚ÄúWell, it's a single body in a basement with a stab wound. Even if they hit a major artery, it‚Äôll probably take us just under two hours.‚Äù I closed the door, climbed in the drivers side and drove to the designated address. 

Our details were usually three simple points:
Number of bodies
Weapon of choice or wound type
Destination

Our mantra for this job has always been, ‚ÄúThe less we know, the better.‚Äù

The drive was silent, the kid was probably questioning his life choices, when we pulled up to a dilapidated, boarded up house with the front door removed and leaning against the patio railing. 

‚ÄúDrug deal gone wrong,‚Äù I guessed, opening my door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm putting twenty bucks. You?‚Äù It had always been tradition to put up fake bets on what you thought happened based on what little information we had and the look of the destination.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asked, staring at the haunted-house-reject with his mouth agape. ‚ÄúOh, uh‚Ä¶ ghost hunting.‚Äù

‚ÄúGhost hunting?‚Äù I opened the side door and pulled out two painter's smocks.

‚ÄúYeah, like, two kids try ghost hunting, one friend spooks the other and they stab their friend to death?‚Äù He took one smock and zipped it on, making sure to tuck any loose hairs back in the hood. We donned out protective equipment, shoe booties, gloves, goggles and headlamps, to avoid leaving anything of ourselves behind.

‚ÄúAnd who‚Äôs paying the hefty price tag for us to come out and hide this?‚Äù I grabbed a gurney with a caddy of cleaning supplies on it and started rolling it toward the door.

‚ÄúWell, in that case.‚Äù He lifted one end as we carried it up the front steps. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs paying to cover up a drug deal?‚Äù

‚ÄòSmart kid,‚Äô I thought and looked at the door, contemplating how to put the door back in the doorway without making new drill holes. ‚ÄúAlright, point made. Drug deal or ghost hunting gone wrong. You‚Äôre on, kid.‚Äù

We wheeled the gurney into the room and left it in the foye, searching the first and second floor for any stragglers or squatters. Cleaning up the murders is easy, getting rid of witnesses is a pain in the ass.
As soon as the room was cleared, we descended the stairs to the basement, leaving the gurney at the top of the steps and carrying down a body bag and the cleaning supplies. The shine of two headlamps illuminated our way into the darkness but the lower down we went, the more both of our speculations seemed less and less likely.

Bloody prints on the steps, walls and railing led our way down. But the prints were not going up the stairwell like there were people leaving, they were trailing back down, like someone was pulling them back. The basement floor was covered in almost an inch of blood, pooled from wall to wall.

‚ÄòThis didn‚Äôt come from one person,‚Äô I thought, looking down the empty room and saw necklaces hanging on the wall behind a brace beam with a body tied to it in the center of the basement. At first glance, the body was facing away from the stairway, tied with their arms up in a Y shape and ankles tied together. We walked further into the room, both beams lighting up certain areas of the body‚Äôs back as we looked over the corpse.

We glanced at each other in silence, out of respect for the deceased, communicating with our eyes, ‚ÄòGuess we were both wrong.‚Äô

I walked around the corpse slowly, surveying the damage. Legs were still intact, no wounds, just some strange markings written in blood. The lower half of the body was nude, displaying the corpse was male, although his equipment was missing, his abdomen was chiseled, guy obviously was a gym member, but his chest was where the obvious cause of death lay.
His chest was flayed open, rags of skin hanging loosely from muscle and bone, and the ribs were all broken outward, like they broke his ribs and opened them to remove whatever was inside. There was an incision like cut in the skin above and below the wound, starting just over his naval and ending at his clavicle. His face was frozen in a horrified look of pain and terror, his eyes staring down at the exposed tissue below him. On his face, aside from the expression, was more of the bloody markings, unknown symbols drawn methodically along his cheeks, nose and forehead, the blood dried and dark, bits of it flaking off.

‚ÄòHe was alive while this happened to him,‚Äô I thought somberly. ‚ÄòHe was alive long enough for this blood to dry on him. How long could something like this take?‚Äô

I heard a coughing behind me and turned quickly to see the kid covering his nose with one hand and pointing down at a mass in the corner. A pile of, I‚Äôd guess six or seven, bodies lay in a pile of blood, guts, and viscera, no definitive characteristics to each body aside from different colored flesh clinging to muscle and bone. I set the cleaning caddy down on the shallowest pool of blood I could find and handed the kid a medium sized garbage bag.

‚ÄúAnything of value goes in here,‚Äù I said coldly. Anything that could be traced back to a victim or suspect was sold to a pawn shop the boss owned; extra money and less evidence.

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he started and choked back bile. ‚ÄúThe boss said one body.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople lie, kid. Start collecting. And keep an eye out for any murder weapons. No way this was done with just their bare hands and a knife.‚Äù

I looked around the body and found a single dagger gleaming in the light of my headlamp, the only thing that wasn‚Äôt covered in dark blood. I gingerly lifted it out of the liquid and examined it closely. The same markings on our corpse were etched into the foot long, silver blade; the handle, about four inches long, held eight rubies and two diamonds. The rubies looked dark as the blood around me and if I stared hard enough, the color seemed to swirl inside, like a liquid being stirred in a pot. I held the dagger gently and raised it slowly to cut the binds on the body‚Äôs wrists, freeing it from the beam and slowly laying it in the body bag, careful not to cut myself on the exposed bones.

The kid started gagging, the sound of squelching coming from his hands digging into the bloody pile for wallets, watches, jewelry or anything else we could hock. I turned back after zipping the bag shut and saw him holding a handful of necklaces with matching pendants.

‚ÄúHold on,‚Äù I called, reaching for one of the necklaces. I took one from his hand and let him drop the rest in the bag.

The pendant had a single symbol carved into a piece of polished wood, one large spot carved in the center with eight smaller, darker spots spiraling out from the center. A crack in the pendant broke a ninth spot, possibly meaning a loss. I looked down and counted the pendants in the bag; six and the one I was holding was seven.

I looked back at the body bag, the eighth occupant of this weird ritual. Or was he the sacrifice for this ritual? I pocketed the necklace, turned back to the cleaning caddy and removed a large, black garbage bag.

Now it was time for my ritual: cleaning this up so it looked like it never happened. We bagged up and collected the mess of dead bodies into garbage bags and set them at the bottom of the stairs. We only had one body bag and this mess would make it more difficult to clean up those bags. Once the bodies were cleaned up, we started mopping up the copious amounts of blood. Luckily the floor for this basement was tiled so it was easy to sop it all up. Unfortunately, that meant we had to go through each crack and loose seal between the tiles and scrub them with a toothbrush to make sure there wasn‚Äôt even a single cell left. We finished soaking up the blood and I started on any chunks left over while the kid cleaned off the support beam. Sweat is harder to clean than blood, mostly because you can‚Äôt see it, but I thought I trained him decently enough that I'd make sure he did it right after he was done.

Once we got the dried blood symbols off the walls, I noticed claw marks on the walls under the blood so maybe they were here before the blood was and decided to ignore it. The kid was shaking a burlap bag of dust and dirt around the newly cleaned floor and I ran over to stop him.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I hollered, shaking him from his autopilot mode. ‚ÄúWe do that on the way out, we still have to walk on this. Try getting the blood out of the stairwell.‚Äù

He nodded and took a rag to the stairwell, leaving me to clean up the dirt mess. Sighing, I swept the dust into the corners, places it would settle if there was a draft or gather due to the settling foundation.

I started filling fresher marks with a plaster/concrete mixture and replacing any missing gouges of wood with our own false wood mix; stronger than real wood, fake enough to look real, gotta love it.

Suddenly, the kid started yelling for help and I heard a squelch, cutting the yells short. I ran over to the stairwell and saw the kid slumped over on the stairwell, blood pooling and dripping down the bottom three steps. I turned the kid over and saw the dagger sticking from his eye, plunged through the socket and into his brain. I stared, mouth agape, and felt the bile rise. I stepped back, trying to choke it down, still feeling the warmth of his fresh body on my hands. Through the glow of my headlamp, I saw the handle of the dagger, the nine blood-red rubies‚Ä¶

Wait.

Nine?

‚ÄòScrew it!‚Äô I thought, threw the kid's body over my shoulder and jogged up the steps, pulling the gurney and the eight occupying bodies out the door. I threw everything in the truck, grabbed a book of matches and walked back to the top of the basement stairs. One thing our boss emphasized with us was to never smoke at work sites; one, the butts and ash show someone was there, and two, the cleaning chemicals were extremely flammable. I struck a match, set it in the book and tossed it down the steps. It landed perfectly on the tiled floor and the floor quickly was engulfed in flames. Since were thorough, the walls and support beam would soon go up so i ran out the building, set the door in the doorway, disregarding setting it properly in the frame, and saw a symbol graffitied on the door; it matched the symbol on the pendant slightly, but looked less clean, more scrawled on with spray paint. I whipped my phone out and took a picture before standing the door in the frame and sped away. Thankfully our tires are specially made so it looks like, well, no one was there, so no tire tracks.

I sped back to the office, almost breaking speed limits but avoiding known speed traps, the whole way back. I slammed on the break as soon as I made it in the garage and immediately vomited in a nearby trash can.

‚ÄúYou okay, bruh?‚Äù a coworker asked. He was in charge of cleaning up inside the vans and changing and disposing of tires after every call. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt seen you like this since your first day.‚Äù

‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt had to deal with that, even with my first day,‚Äù I croaked, throwing a finger at the side door of the van.
He rolled the door open and shouted, ‚ÄúMadre de Dios!‚Äù I didn't even have to look to know he saw the kid‚Äôs dead body draped over the gurney, dripping blood and feces on the floor.. Or maybe it was laying on the floor in a pool of blood and feces; I was driving pretty fast and heard a few things fall and thump down while I was.

I heard him call over the intercom for our boss to come down to the garage while the only female in the company, the one who made the coffee and cleaned the breakroom, walked me to a nearby sink to rinse my mouth out and wash my face. She stood with me, holding my shaking hands and keeping me close to a trash can in case there was more that came out, while we listened to the boss and the auto guy talk about what they saw. I heard another squelch and my stomach lurched, watching the boss pull the dagger from the kids eye, the blade still a gleaming, clean silver.
He walked over to us and held the dagger up, displaying it to me. ‚ÄúWhere did you find this?‚Äù he asked. Was‚Ä¶ was that fear in his voice?

‚ÄúAt the scene,‚Äù I croaked out, trying not to look at the newest bloody ruby in the handle.

‚ÄúHow many diamonds did it have when you found it?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, how many diamonds?‚Äù He emphasized ‚Äòdiamonds,‚Äô enunciating each syllable.

‚ÄúEight rubies, two diamonds.‚Äù I was sounding angrier but I didn‚Äôt like being treated like an idiot who couldn't count gems.

He looked at the dagger and asked, ‚ÄúHow many bodies?‚Äù

‚ÄúIncluding the kid?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you got there.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere was one on a beam and six or seven in a pile in the corner.‚Äù

He looked back up at me, a look of utter terror on his usually stern face. ‚ÄúWhat happened to the building? When you left, what happened!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI burned it down. Something was in there, it attacked the kid and there were these symbols everywhere-‚Äù

‚ÄúSymbols?‚Äù His eyes went wide. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

I took my phone out and showed him the picture. ‚ÄúThis was on the door. It was the only one I got a picture of. I also found this.‚Äù I took the pendant out of my pocket and held it out to him.

He stared at the picture and took the pendant, analyzing it methodically. He then ran out of the garage with the pendant and the dagger, yelling over his shoulder, ‚ÄúGo home; you‚Äôll get a full day's pay!‚Äù

He slammed the door behind him and disappeared from sight. We all watched, looked at the van with the new kid's body then left the building, without a single word between the three of us.

The next day, the van was gone, along with the bodies from yesterday and any evidence I was at the call site yesterday. It was weird being on the other side of my own job. I ran into my boss and asked him about the van.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs being cleaned,‚Äù he replied quickly, slipping a pendant back in my hand with a slip of paper and strode quickly to his office.

I left for the break room and saw the cleaner and shop guy sitting at a table, each with similar pendants and slips of paper. I sat at the table with them and set my pendant on the table with theirs and read my note.

‚ÄúKeep this with you for the next ten days. No arguments. Do NOT leave it anywhere! KEEP IT WITH YOU!! TEN DAYS!!‚Äù

I looked at my coworkers and broke the silence. ‚ÄúI think we need to keep these with us for the next ten days.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why ten?‚Äù she asked.

I looked at the pendants and finally noticed how different they looked from other ones I found in the basement yesterday. This one was on a white, polished stone and looked more like an eyeball with a black iris and a white constricted pupil and eight black spots surrounding the black.

Eight black spots and one white in the center makes nine, and the others had ten total black spots, the outer nine looked painted black spiraling out from a lighter center spot.

‚ÄúOurs is not to ask why,‚Äù he spoke like he‚Äôs said this hundreds of times. ‚ÄúOurs is to do as we‚Äôre told.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not the saying,‚Äù she said, grabbing her pendant and walking out suddenly.

‚ÄúAround here, it is,‚Äù he muttered, grabbed his pendant and walked out after her, probably both going to their respective duties.

I sat in the break room staring at the pendant, like I would a cup of coffee, waiting for the boss to come in with my first call of the day. Nothing‚Äôs changed‚Ä¶ right?

Right?

1hx7bcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hx7bcv/this_is_the_fourth_time_my_dad_has_absolutely/,This is the fourth time my dad has absolutely ruined my life. ,"I‚Äôm being melodramatic and throwing a pity party but this is a vent sub so I‚Äôm just gonna speak my truth that I don‚Äôt dare say to anyone out loud. 

The first time he ruined my life was when he decided to have a baby with my crack addicted mother who had no interest in being my mom and never was. He should‚Äôve figured that out, considering she was almost 40, wanted an abortion, did crack while she was pregnant with me, and already had two grown kids that were raised by other people from birth because she was incapable of doing so herself. But his desire to have a child/not be ‚Äòresponsible‚Äô for a fetus being aborted was more important than reality. 

The second time was when he decided to remarry a woman (my stepmom) he‚Äôd been married to 20 years prior that treated him like dirt (both times they were married) and then proceeded to physically and emotionally abuse him, me, and her own three children, despite one of them being physically disabled, and do nothing to divorce her to save himself or save me. That woman stripped me naked and paraded me in front of our household to punish me. She locked me in closets. She fucking poured freshly brewed coffee over my head when I was 8 years old because I dared to get up out of bed to get water. And he did nothing. Just threw himself a fucking pity party when she eventually left and bankrupted him. 

The third time was when he decided that his response to my depression and anxiety as a teen after my stepmom divorced him was to prescribe and supply me alcohol and marijuana, at 14 fucking years old. I deal with addiction to this day, and while I know I‚Äôm my own person and responsible for my choices and actions, unlike him, in this moment I am pissed the fuck off at him for that. 

The fourth time was when he decided to spend 12 years after the divorce from my stepmom self medicating with marijuana and alcohol, ensuring that he had dementia by 65, so that I had to find him half dead on the floor, put my entire fucking life on hold, drag his dog‚Äôs dead body out of his house, and move him in with me and MY beautiful family, who doesn‚Äôt fucking deserve to have to put up with this shit. Take care of him (which is a 24/7 fucking job) and clean his shit off my toilets and walls and argue with him about how much alcohol and marijuana he can consume while living with my husband and my stepson and my 1.5 year old daughter, who, despite living ten minutes away from me, he‚Äôd met a total of five times in the last year and a half. Before he moved in with us two weeks ago. And then he complains that she does normal toddler things, like cry. And whine. Because she‚Äôs a toddler. And that‚Äôs what she does. 

I don‚Äôt need to be told. I‚Äôm sure by my post history that anyone can see that I‚Äôm unfolding. Yes he needs to go into a facility. And yes he will. But at this moment, right now, he is still in my house, being a stubborn, selfish addict, and dementia ridden, so I can‚Äôt lash out on him without feeling guilty. So instead I‚Äôm venting. Fuck this guy. Fuck his selfishness. Fuck the absolute hell he‚Äôs put me through. He‚Äôs no father. He‚Äôs a parasite. I don‚Äôt want to take care of him. Sometimes I wish I‚Äôd listened to him when I found him on the floor, and left him there. In that one moment, he was absolutely right. I should‚Äôve just fucking walked away, because I do have my own family to worry about, and he told me that and I didn‚Äôt listen. I tried to do the right, moral thing, instead. I should‚Äôve fucking left him there.

I work in Texas and do gig work here and there..., sometimes construction, sometimes event setups. My credit score isn‚Äôt the greatest (around 690), so finding a loan that‚Äôs fast and not insanely expensive has been a challenge.

A few days ago, I was searching for **Coffee Break Loans** while looking for something to hold me over until my next gig paycheck. I liked how easy their application seemed, but I was a bit skeptical (as anyone should be, right?). The question that popped up in my head: **Is Coffee Break Loans legit?**

That said, I‚Äôm still a bit cautious because payday-style loans can pile up interest fast.

Has anyone else tried them? What‚Äôs your experience? I‚Äôm also open to hearing about **alternative loan options** that are more reasonable for people with subprime credit.

No traditionally broken combos, no insane damage scaling, let me tell you a tale.

My deck was okay through act 1. I took a coffee dripper, soon to be offset with bites (no strikes removed, max hp loss was such that I lost only 6 current hp, an ideal bites take. Next, I found the J.A.X event. Well, no strikes to transform, and a way to heal the damage? Taking the JAX, especially since now I have some slow scaling in fights. This gimmick gets me to act 3 (I take a black star).

The next event is the mind bloom event. I have courier AND membership card. I can also path to 2 shops, at a loss of elites (who cares, suck it black star). I take it, next floor is Golden Shrine (regret event that offers 275 gold). I take the regret since its like 650 effective gold. I go to a shop, buy SIXTEEN RELICS including WINGED BOOTS, PEACE PIPE, BLUE CANDLE, and a preserved insect. I wing my boots to every elite, clean up nicely, remove both normalities, keep the regret in exchange for more gold, I then find a maw bank and a ceramic fish, so I can't go to a shop this act of course. I beat the daylights out of the act 3 bosses (-10 strength from malaise).

Next, I get to the act 4 shop and buy 4 more relics, beat the stuffing out of him and the heart. Here are some pics from the run:

Anyways, thanks for reading this all. One of the wilder runs I've had in a while. Also tacking this on, rearranging relics could be a cool mechanic because you could keep the tracking relics in one spot or organize by defensive/offensive relics etc, but also if you have a second screen you can keep stuff together.

1hx76nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/1hx76nv/bruiser_the_bruce/,Bruiser (The Bruce),"Bruiser was a bruiser.  He was a magnificent beast.  Dame an American Bulldog.  Sire a good Redbone Coonhound of larger than average size.  

With the best qualities of both, as will sometimes happen in the best of circumstances. 

From the mother;  deep, broad chest;  thick, powerful neck and shoulders;  strong jaws; and all thick, solid muscle. 

From the sire;  long legs, great wind, and natural hunting instinct.  He required little in the way of training. 

Mostly reddish coloration, with a cream chest, white stockings on three legs, and a white blaze on his snout up to between his eyes. 

Quite beautiful, really.  And big.  

Avid hunters would cross different breeds sometimes, seeking a superior animal that incorporated traits of both, with sometimes better than hoped-for results, as with Bruiser. 

My brothers and I had acquired him young, just as he was old enough to be weaned.  An adult cousin of ours had a dog with a new litter, and he had asked Gramp to bring us by so that we could take our pick of it; whichever pup we chose.  

It would have been in the wintertime when we went to see him, late in the day.  That I remember.  There was a deep chill in the air.  Gramp and we had our coats on.  And the surrounding hillsides were gray with bare trees.  The black loamy soil among them covered with layers of dead brown leaves whose older under layers were well along in the process of reverting back to the earth that had once nourished them.  

There was nigh always a dampness in the air in those mountains during the winter months. Even when it wasn‚Äôt raining; which it often was. Daylight came late, and darkness fell early.  Especially in the shadowy hollows (hollers) that were folds between opposing rising wooded hillsides.  Down the centers of which ran small burbling tributary streams.  

And there was a Smell in the air that I still remember.  Cold flowing water; rich, damp black earth;  and decaying fallen leaves.  Hints of tannin musk in flowing waters, among the crisper sweetness.  Faint traces of cold weak coffee and strong tea - from the quiet, darkly brooding hillsides asleep now in the dead season. Breathe deep and drink it all in.  I loved it. 

We knew right away which one we wanted.  He was bigger than the rest, and stronger.  We watched as he forced aside some complaining weaker siblings to seize a prized hind teat for himself.  Looked like he‚Äôd already been getting more than his share. 

So far so good.  Next test; pick him up and pry open his mouth to see the color of his palate and gums.  

Healthy pink gums;  not too pale, not too bright.  Good circulation, not anemic, and not overheating for no reason.  

Roof of the mouth pigmented nice and dark.  Another good sign indicating superior quality (it has no bearing, really, but we believed that at the time).  

So far so good.  Now dangle him by the loose scruff of his neck and see if he squirms or whines.  That would indicate a dog of a weak, complaining nature, of poor spirit.  

But he just looked silently back into my eyes with curious ones of his own asking ‚ÄúAnd just who the hell are You?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis one, Clayton.‚Äù  And Clay was laughing.  He‚Äôd figured that‚Äôd be the one. 

Driving back home, the three of us crowded in the cab of the truck with Gramp as night came on, we now had a dog of our own curled asleep in my lap.

The more bruiser grew, the more he ate.  And the  more he ate, the bigger he got.  But he never got fat.  Just unconscionably strong.  

And he would hunt anything at all.  Whatever we set him to.  A man once offered us two hundred  dollars for him, which was a lot of money for three youngsters in the late sixties.  Well, he first offered it to Gramp.  But Gramp said he was Our dog, so he needed to ask Us.  We turned him down, of course.  

Now, Bruiser was an eating machine.  Perpetually hungry, it seemed, no matter how much he was fed.  As another had been.  Bruce being robust and healthy, we put it down to greed.  

He was on a little thin ice with Gramp for a while one year because of it.  We‚Äôd planted a good patch of sweet corn in the center of our front field away from the fences that year, intending it for the table.  Surrounded by lesser field corn for the stock.  And it was coming along nicely, the green stalks taller now than a man.  

We began noticing, as time went by, that Bruiser (The Bruce), had been making repeated trips in and out of that field each day, and went to investigate.  And found that he had pulled down every stalk and eaten every cob of ripening corn.  

But further did he one day transgress.  We‚Äôd been squirrel hunting, and had made a good haul.  Gramp and we were down at the edge of the creek    as usual, skinning and cleaning our catch.  

Bruiser with us, as usual.  We‚Äôd toss him the hides and entrails, and he‚Äôd snatch them out of the air and swallow them whole in a single gulp.  

Gramp had just again repeated that procedure when Bruce, overcome by the sight of the just-skinned carcass in Gramp‚Äôs hand, forgot all caution and lunged forward.  

Gramp looked down at the half of a squirrel that he still held; the front end bitten clean off and swallowed whole.  Then back at Bruiser, who was trying to look innocent, despite witnesses.  

‚ÄúWell, ye might as well have the rest‚Äù, and tossed it over.  

The Bruce was watching intently as Gramp worked on another one.  Until Gramp said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù

Bruce looked away, and you know, that dog managed to look offended at being thought capable of such a thing.  ",2,1736406060.0,FuckeryUniveristy,0,1.0,False

Hydrocortisone is incredible but addictive. Every 2 weeks or so I let my self use it

One of the most important parts is moisture. Moisture is bad. Moisturizer is often bad too. When the skin is too moist it weakens and for me often sheds. 

To control moisture I dab dry after the shower and then double dry with toilet paper.   You can use baby powder or goldbond to get skin very dry. Medicated stuff works well and feels incredible when your skin isn‚Äôt too damaged. 

Zinc oxide works wonders. It prevents moisture from damaging your skin. If your skin is weeping or sweating it will make you feel more comfortable and when you shower at the end of the day your skin will be left feeling healthier. 

For healing balms‚Ä¶ again mostly avoid moisturizer‚Ä¶ but oils work well. To me they feel better. They absorb more with less sensory issues and never burn. They also tend to be anti fungal and seem to help me heal. 

I get a lot of scaly build up in and around the area. I like occasionally using psoriasis cleaner. Sometimes I find using oil before the shower can help clean the area without damaging it too. 

If you‚Äôre bougie baths with oatmeal(the Aveno stuff) or epsom salt help. 

Sometimes I mix my oil or (unscented) soap with tea tree oil. Just 2 or 3 drops‚Ä¶ no more! You will hurt yourself if you use more. This is antifungal and feels cleansing. Idk if it works but it really feels like it does which helps me keep my mind off it and the slight burn of the tea tree oil helps a lot with itch. 

Cotton boxers. 

A lot of these don‚Äôt work together. You can‚Äôt powder and oil‚Ä¶ so experiment. I hope this helps. I would love some recs!

/\* LONG STORY HERE, SKIPPABLE ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

So, I'm a guy, 42, one kid (9M), born in the US but moved to another country in 2008. I met someone here and we got married two years later.

I knew she was spoiled. Her family is very rich, where I was born in poverty, so I wasn't really sure what aspects of her behavior were normal for her upbringing, and I guess I missed a lot of red flags because of that. She was lazy, but she worked, she went out, we did fun stuff together. She had a short temper, but I grew up with a mom and sister who would explode at the tiniest provocation, so I guess that just felt normal to me. The first time I really questioned marrying her was when her brother took me aside and asked me if I was ok, and if I really wanted to marry his sister. I brushed it off as an older brother talking shit on his little sister.

We got married. I was 27, she was 29. Weddings here use cash as a traditional gift, and she had all her friends, family, family friends, coworkers, etc. There. I had a pretty short list. My friends are on the other side of the planet. My mom, sister, and grandmother came out here, but that was it, plus my few friends here. The gifting was enough to pay off the wedding entirely, but I guess the profit wasn't enough, because that night, my wedding night, she absolutely threw off the handle at me, shrieking, tearing up photos from a photobook my sister made for her showing our family through the years, calling my friends and family poor trash. I was too stunned to understand what to do, so I just hunkered down and waited it out. She said a lot of stuff I still haven't forgotten. ""Why did I marry an American? Why did I marry you?""

Our honeymoon was peaceful enough, but it was a tour vacation, which was just us driving around with other couples to 10+ locations a day and pretending to have fun at them for photos, then off to the next place. Minor shit, I was still happy. Over the years, I had learned to be careful about holidays. She's addicted to TV dramas, and I was expected to be the Perfect Man at all times. I had to give increasingly elaborate gifts. I was not due gifts, because I was the Man. The Man gives gifts, the Woman takes them. Stop being selfish. I didn't have a dad so I never saw what a good marriage looked like. I just accepted it. Once, I picked her up from the airport and had trouble finding her gate.

When I got there, she was sitting, and she was clearly furious. She was gone for a week. I was supposed to be right there, waiting with a gift and flowers, so she could run dramatically to me and hug me. But I didn't even care enough to get there on time. ""Why did I marry an American? Why did I marry you?"" I'm not trying to drama here, that's just a phrase I heard a lot. Around this time, she started using a term with me when she was angry in her language that I hadn't heard. I could tell it wasn't friendly, but I ignored it. A few weeks later, when out eating with coworkers, I offhandedly asked what that term when, and the table went dead silent. ""Where did you hear that? Did someone call you that?"" I lied and just said I heard it on TV, but later looked it up, and while it doesn't really have a direct English translation, I'd say ""crippled retard"" comes closest. I did confront her about that, and she insisted she was just saying it in jest, but according to my friends here, native speakers of the language, that's just not language you use against anyone you care anything about.

She decided around this time that she would quit her job because she didn't like it. I asked her what she would do if I just quit my job to sit around the apartment all day watching TV and she said she would divorce me. The D word came up a lot, any time I did something she didn't like. Washing the dishes wrong? Doing the laundry wrong? Asking to take a nap sometimes because I was so tired from working all day? ""Fine, we'll just divorce then, ok?"" I know now this was an obvious manipulation tactic, but I didn't know it then. I was just scared to losing this marriage. I knew that if I just did everything right, she'd be happy and start treating me well. She didn't clean, didn't really go anywhere or do anything during the year she didn't work. As soon as I got home, I had to ""help"" her clean, which entailed me cleaning and her watching TV.

I know I should have left even before then, but I was dumb and thought I could salvage this. Fights just didn't work the way I thought they did. I stayed calm, I never insulted or shouted, and I absolutely never laid a hand on her out of anger. I made my share of mistakes that I probably did deserve some flack for, but nothing egregious. I really was trying hard to be a great husband, but all that seemed to do was just make her angrier. Still, there were good times mixed with the bad, and what was really an incredibly toxic relationship still just seemed normal to me. It was around this time, 2015, that she got pregnant. We were thrilled, and that nine months, while tense, was probably the best we had, and now I have a son who I love more than anything.

When he was around 1 year old, I started waking up with her holding my nose and covering my mouth. The first time, I panicked and shouted at her, and she just exploded at me. I was snoring and it was waking her up. After a couple weeks of his, with her just kicking me now every time I snored instead of choking me, she just told me I needed to sleep on the office floor. I slept there for 3 years, usually with the baby, because she was tired and didn't want to have to wake up to feed and take care of him. I didn't complain, because this is my son. He will never hear me complain about taking care of him.

One night, she told me she was going out for a walk. I said she should take the dog and she said no. I mentioned that she rarely ever walks the dog, and that if she's going out, it would be nice to bring the dog, but she insisted. Several hours passed. She didn't answer the phone when I called, so I walked downstairs and saw that her car was gone.

I noticed she was starting to spend a lot of time in her room on the phone. I ignored it. While I'm not ignorant of the language here, listening to a native speak at full speed is a challenge and I didn't care to eavesdrop anyway. The time she spent in there was time she wasn't focused on me, which was a good thing. One time, though, she was in the living room on her phone. I walked in and started a sentence and she frantically started waving her arms and shushing me. I was confused, but I was also used to her just cutting me off and telling me to shut up that I didn't immediately register it until I heard a male voice come out of the phone. I was shattered in that moment. A number of odd little behaviors of hers instantly connected in that moment. I opened the door and walked out.

She chased me down the stairs, asking me where I was going. I just said to her mother's house, and she panicked, apologizing for what was probably the first time profusely. She hates her mom, and she's afraid of her, and this would be very bad for her to find out about. The fool that I am, I listened and went back into the apartment. She insists to this day that nothing happened that night that she drove out. She met a guy at a singles event she was only at to support her friend, got his number and chatted. The night she lied about taking a walk, she just decided to drive around for a few hours. I didn't believe her, but I just didn't have the energy or will to fight any more.

We went on a vacation that summer to a popular island in this country. 10 days. She slept all day, every day. When the baby cried, she ordered me to take him out of the room with me. The weather was awful, rain the entire trip, so he and I sat out in the lobby and played. I went back into the room but he started to cry, which woke her up, and she grabbed a coffee mug on the nightstand and hurled it against the wall, shattering it loudly and shrieking at me for waking her up. Again, ""Why did I marry you?"" I called her a psycho, which I shouldn't have done, I know, and I took our son and went back to the lobby.

The hell vacation went otherwise ok. Sightseeing, screaming at me for not taking photos the way she does, all that. We got home and things went pretty calm again for awhile, until the day she found out that her mom had come in to clean and threw away a Starbucks coupon. You've all seen a child throw an actual kicking, screaming, crying tantrum, I'm sure. That was her. That was her any time her mother did something she didn't like. She threw a footbath through the plaster on the wall and tipped over the baby's little plastic dresser. I just sat in the living room holding him. She eventually stopped and came in and told me to clean up. I asked her who threw the baby's dresser down and she just said ""You really want to fight with me right now?"" I cleaned it all up. From here, it all started getting worse, and fast. She was now throwing things like her phone at me while I was holding the baby, and even aggressively pushed me while I was holding him because I was going down the stairs too slowly. I nearly fell, and turned around sharply to ask her if she was insane. I was holding the baby! What if I fell down the stairs with him! ""Well, I knew you wouldn't fall"".

Nothing notably horrible happened from there until the day I finally just snapped. I was in place; office floor with the baby, when I wake up panicked again. She was holding my nose and covering my mouth. I jumped up and just shouted ""WHAT THE F\*\*\*?"". She got upset because she was trying to be cute and playful and I exploded at her. She left for work after that, and I started packing. She was shocked that I was leaving. She thought everything was just fine in our marriage.

/\* STORY OVER /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I left an abusive marriage. Me leaving was very messy. Her family threatened to have me deported. She threated to have me deported and tell my son I left because I didn't love him. (I told her when we were dating that my dad left because he didn't care to be a father). At any moment, they probably could have done it too, but I held my ground, even as a foreigner here with very little legal protection. I'm still here now. She got the apartment, the car, all the savings and various other accounts.

She had custody for a while, during which I paid her child support, roughly half my paycheck, but eventually, caring for him became too much work and she signed him over to me. I receive no support at all from her. I hate so much that she will be set for life and I lose everything, but that's how it is, being a foreigner against a native here.

I'm glad I left. I wasn't perfect. I know that, but nothing I did deserved being treated the way I was. I'm out, but I'm ruined. I do have a good job teaching AP Computer Science at an expensive international private school that gives my son free tuition, and having him move in with me has been a big boost to my morale, plus a big advantage I could not otherwise have given him. I see a therapist who has diagnosed me with PTSD and clinical depression, and while I struggle really opening up with him, I'm doing my best. It's hard talking about my problems because as I said above, I just feel selfish wanting someone else to focus on me when I'm sure they have their own problems to handle.

The last few days have been difficult for me though. I don't know why I suddenly started thinking about it, but I started thinking about having another relationship, and I became incredibly dismayed.

I'm 42. I have no home of my own, no retirement, no car, a son, and a small teacher's pension. Other men my age own homes, have retirement savings, vehicles, all things I don't have much chance of ever getting now. Raising my son alone isn't cheap, and I'm saving all the money I can for his college, because I don't want him going through any of the struggles I had to go through.

But on the dating market, I'm cooked. Divorced, single dad, poor, no real assets to speak of. I am pretty healthy, especially for 42, and never really struggled dating before, and even shortly after my marriage, although I wasn't ready to be in another relationship those times, so they ended, of course. Long-term, I just have nothing to offer. I try to be respectful loyal, and kind, but that's just a basic requisite of being a good partner. It isn't a reason on its own to choose to be with someone. Lots of guys are respectful, supportive, kind, etc, but they also don't come with tons of baggage.

I'm not great at reading red flags in people, but I'm improving. This is good, but it is also making me very self-conscious. I want to meet a stable, kind woman, but that kind of woman is just going to see only red flags with me. I honestly am starting to wonder if dating me IS a red flag in and of itself. Like, if she is with me, she is bad at choosing partners. The kind of guy her friends would get together with her to figure out just what she thinks she is doing and try to keep her from choosing someone who will only make her life harder.

I don't even know what I'm asking here, or what I'm needing to hear. I just let all this build up for so long that I needed an outlet for the pressure I'm under.  I do have friends and hobbies, and I'm always building on my skills for work and for fun. I'm very focused on moving forward and being a better me, and I'm doing what I can toward prioritizing and taking care of myself. I'm not in a rush to find someone new, but I am becoming worried that this is now simply an impossibility. I don't want to be alone forever.

**The Taxi Ride**

Assuming the taxi left from the corner of W 86th Street and Columbus Avenue and departed in the direction of Central Park (given the reflection of the sunrise), the trip would have taken an estimated 16 minutes to 26 minutes to arrive at 2372 Amsterdam Avenue, New York.

**Exiting the Taxi**

""The defendant then fled northeast on 54^(th)¬†Street and took an e-bike uptown, before getting into a Taxi that took him to West 178^(th)¬†Street and Amsterdam Avenue."" - Manhattan DA.

Interestingly this drop-off location is not mentioned in the Federal Complaint. Instead, they noted the following:

""At approximately 7:04 a.m., the Sh--ter entered a taxi that drove him to the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal in the vicinity of West 179th Street and Fort Washington Avenue in Upper Manhattan.""

The background of the below image indicates 2372 Amsterdam Avenue was the drop-off point for this taxi ride. I adjusted the original Google Maps route suggested to account for this drop-off location as the taxi was facing South along Amsterdam Avenue.

**Commute to the Bus Terminal**

""At approximately 7:30 a.m., video footage from the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal captured the Sh--ter entering the facility. No video footage showed the Sh--ter leaving the bus terminal, suggesting that the Sh--ter left New York City""

The commute is possible in the provided timeframe if the taxi encountered no traffic and the passenger walked to the Bus Terminal in any one of the routes provided by Google Maps.

*Question*: Why did the taxi passenger walk South when the fastest path to the Bus Terminal is in the other direction?

*Question*: Where is the video footage from the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal? Is this person wearing the same clothes and same shoes as seen in previous images and video footage?

1hx6t25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1hx6t25/i_dont_get_how_to_make_food_logging_work_for_me/,I don't get how to make food logging work for me,"I know that logging your daily intake can be helpful for both making sure you're eating under your TDEE and getting your macros in, but I just don't understand how people make it work if they primarily cook at home.

Background: I (43 F) cook at home probably 5-6 nights a week, and it's been that way for many years. I've never been into packaged snacks or fast food, and I don't drink alcohol or sodas. I stick to the perimeter of the grocery store. No shame intended to those who do struggle with those temptations; I say this only to explain my situation. Over time, as I worked my way up to my HW, I was mostly perplexed as to why it was happening, because I felt like my overall diet was pretty decent and the volume of food seemed on par with the amount my non-obese friends ate. But clearly I had a weight problem, so I had to take a harder look at what I was actually eating. And the answer is that I'm mostly cooking French and Italian food. So heavy on the saturated fat (lots of butter and cream) and heavy on carbs (hello, pasta!).  

Fast-forward to now. I recently started Zepbound and my portions are much smaller now. I'm a little worried I'm not getting enough nutrition. I'm prioritizing protein, but probably only getting 80g a day. Total calories might be as low as 1000 on some days (rough estimate). Tracking my intake could be helpful, but seriously, how the heck do home cooks do it?! I'm not following any exact recipes - I'm a ""this needs a little more of x"" cook who tastes as I go. Are people seriously weighing every single input into a recipe and then ALSO both calculating how many servings are in a finished dish and then how many servings they ate? I just can't imagine living like that. What do people do when they aren't eating stuff that's already got a nutrition label on it or a barcode to scan?

A recent example daily log:  

Breakfast: Coffee with 1 tsp sugar and cream, 2 hardboiled eggs, 1 piece of buttered whole wheat toast 

Lunch: Protein shake 

Dinner: 1 Bowl of Stuffed Pepper Soup (has ground beef and lots of veggies), black tea w/ 4g of sugar.

I'm guessing that's maybe 1000-1300 total calories and maybe, if I'm lucky, 80g of protein. All depends on how much ground beef and bone broth gave me in the soup, but I only ate one bowl, so it can't be outrageously high. And that would be an example of a day that's easier to log. I made homemade chicken salad to use as a high protein lunch and I have no idea how much of about 12 different ingredients I put into it, nor the total yield, nor how much of a serving a scoop represents.

Would greatly appreciate advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation!",2,1736404452.0,Zepbound,6,1.0,False

It is mostly under 3 ft high but pretty dense. We can't walk through it. And the area is something like 0.20 acres.

We are planning on going through with a power tool and cutting it down at the base, raking up and disposing of the waste, laying coffee bean bags down (I have an abundant supply) and then mulching very thickly with wood chip mulching (I have an abundant supply of these as well). Coffee bean bags and mulch are free so it's really just a matter of how much time I want to spend laying it down; I much prefer that to pulling holly out.

Our goal is to get rid of this holly problem for good. I know that even with the most effective methods of removal I will have to maintain areas that have resprouted. Any thoughts on how effective this method might be? I don't see this method talked about online so I'm concerned it's going to be a waste of time and the holly will just grow right through the decomposed coffee bags and mulch.

1hx6mpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1hx6mpg/ideas_for_phasmophobia_based_encounters/,Ideas for phasmophobia based encounters,"I've been hosting some phasmophobia one-shots for my friends whenever our regular DM couldn't DM that day so we wouldn't go a week with nothing. Recently, the campaign got canned, so I decided to make the one-shots into a full campaign. The problem comes with the ""Entity"" encounters I made for my players as it works well on paper, but as we know, plans can go up in flames pretty quickly. Here's the outline I made for the players and me. Feel free to take some of the ideas for yourself if you like them.

1. The set-up phase is an essential aspect of the game where players can gather evidence before the entity fully manifests. Evidence can come in various forms, such as photographs, audio recordings, and video footage, and it's essential to the players' success in identifying the entity type\* and defeating it. As players progress, they'll need to use their skills to gather sufficient evidence while working against the ticking clock.
2. Once the setup phase is over and the timer has finished, it's time for the entity to go on the hunt. As you know, it becomes easier for the entity to manifest when the group's average sanity\* is low, but thankfully, there's a cooldown period between each hunt. Unless a cursed object is used, cursed hunts also have a chance of being triggered. So make sure to use all the time you're given to properly identify the entity type and prepare for the final battle.
3. After the hunting phase, it's time for the final battle. In this phase, you'll need to summon the entity for a showdown. To do this, your Arcana Specialist will use their expertise to perform the necessary summoning ritual. Meanwhile, your team will be on the battlefield, ready to fight the entity and send it back to wherever it came from. You'll use all the information you've gathered during the set-up phase and the hunting phase to strategize and come up with the best battle plan. Remember, your goal is to defeat the entity and send it back to the afterlife, so make every move count.



**Gathering evidence** \- When gathering evidence in the set-up or hunting phase, keep in mind that your primary goal is to identify the type of haunting form the entity is using as a cover. Remember to observe the entity‚Äôs abilities and traits to uncover any clues that may help you identify it. Certain entities exhibit traits and behaviours unique to their type, such as Mares interacting with lights more often or Onis being more active and causing more events. Some of these traits may be subject to the game's random nature and may not manifest, so it's crucial to gather as much evidence as possible. After collecting the necessary evidence, consult with your Arcana Specialist to properly identify the threat and eliminate it, as this will make it easier to defeat the entity. Keep in mind that it's also encouraged to find the place of death or anything that may bring the entity back, such as remains, objects, or other items related to its existence**.**



**Locating the entity**\- Depending on the entity type, the difficulty level as well as direct player activity determining where the entity currently is on a map can be a tedious task, especially on larger maps. Identifying the entity‚Äôs location correctly can save a lot of time (and lives) while identifying its nature.

Generally, the location of an entity can be split into two categories:

* Favourite room
* Entities current room

It is important to know the distinction between the entity's favourite room (a.k.a. ""entity room"") and its current room. The favourite room is specific in the map where the entity teleports back to after every hunt, as well as where Ghost Orbs will appear. On the other hand, the entity's current room is where the entity physically is and does not have to be the favourite room.

Generally, identifying both the favourite room and the entity‚Äôs current location will aid the investigation. The setting up of equipment will mostly be centred around the favourite room. Depending on the room size, you may need to watch out for the entity moving favourite rooms (only on difficulties where this can occur, e.g. Professional, Nightmare, and Insanity), and place your equipment accordingly. This will mostly occur in small or tight rooms like bathrooms and hallways of houses.

Some of these tips may be useful for the initial finding of the entity, while some are better used later in the investigation.



**Sanity** \- Sanity is relevant in hauntings for many reasons. For one, the higher the average sanity, the less we have to worry about causing a hunt. Hunting is not the only thing we need to worry about, because depending on the entity, its power can increase exponentially. Not to worry! If you are in a room that is lit, you don‚Äôt have to worry about your sanity draining. The same goes if you brought a tier 3 flashlight, or cast a spell that summons light.



**Hunt** \- Speaking of hunts, let's clear some misconceptions. Saying the entity‚Äôs name does not initiate a hunt. It just means you‚Äôll have a higher chance of getting a coffee mug chucked at your head. Holy symbols also don‚Äôt stop an ongoing hunt, it just buys you time before you have an actual hunt. If someone gets caught during a hunt, the entity will attack the player in question and end the hunt immediately. You cannot hurt the entity while it‚Äôs hunting but it can hurt you, even more so if your sanity is low. You can hide during a hunt, you‚Äôll just have to roll a stealth check, the DC being the entity‚Äôs passive perception. You gain an advantage if you find a particular area being covered Or you cast invisibility. Be wary of entities with true sight, however.¬†

Your handlers will always tell you when a hunt is happening and when it ends. On the off chance your handlers are unable to tell you when a hunt is happening, keep an eye out for any signs of a hunt happening. Shortness of breath, flickering lights, and thumping footsteps are pretty good signs. And also, the entity heading your way.



**Fighting Phase** \- It's critical to carefully identify the entity type and its favourite room before performing the ritual. Properly identifying the entity‚Äôs type and favourite room will help ensure the ritual is performed accurately and successfully. The consequences of a failed ritual can range from minor inconveniences to potentially fatal consequences, so it's important to take caution and double-check your work before proceeding. Additionally, it's important to have a plan in place in case the ritual goes wrong,

1. The entity may take over and become more aggressive, leading to increased hauntings and potential physical harm to the players.
2. The ritual may make the entity more powerful, making it more difficult to deal with and increasing the risk of serious harm during the fight.
3. The ritual may fail to remove the haunting entirely, leading to the continued presence of the entity.
4. The ritual may have unintended consequences, such as summoning an entirely new entity along with the current one or triggering unexpected reactions from the environment.

  
\*Entity type - based on the ghosts in phasmophobia; Demon, Banshee, Spirit, etc. This does not mean players will be fighting those specifically, but it is to determine what kind of ritual a specialist needs to use.

\*Sanity - Based on a counter from 10 for each player. If a player is in total darkness for to long (doesn't matter if they have darkvision or not) or has caught a glimpse of the entity, the counter ticks down one. It can cause minor hallucinations early on, but you may later confuse your fellow investegors as the entity and can cause injury to them or yourself.

  
Admittedly, I'd like to have more consequences for a failed ritual, but that's a problem for future me to worry about. The thing that I actually have a problem with is the evidence gathering. I've already translated some of the items in the game (like the spirit box and the thermometer) into items the players can use in game and have made ways on how the players could gather the evidence needed for the entity of the week. The problem is that the gathering evidence mission feels obsolete or even pointless. Or rather there could be a better way for them to gather evidence that I'm just not seeing? I don't know. I'd appreciate any input or ideas.

1hx6lfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1hx6lfr/my_productivity_tools_and_systems/,My Productivity Tools and Systems,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share some productivity tools and organizational methods that have worked for me. I‚Äôve been enjoying seeing how other people set up their systems and use different apps, and I‚Äôm always curious to learn about new approaches! These systems help me stay on track, especially as someone managing ADHD and juggling a busy schedule as an Outdoor Educator. I‚Äôve picked up a lot of ideas from posts here, like using habit trackers or the phone foyer method and thought I‚Äôd return the favour by sharing what‚Äôs worked for me. These methods aren‚Äôt always perfect, but they‚Äôre simple enough to fall into without too many steps or friction. I‚Äôm always tweaking and refining these, so feel free to share your own ideas too. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found helpful:

**1. Google Calendar**  
I live by my Google Calendar. I‚Äôve set up multiple calendars for different areas of my life: work, personal events, and a shared one with my partner. With our irregular schedules, the shared calendar has been a lifesaver for syncing up plans. I‚Äôll even time-block my hobbies and relaxation‚Äîit‚Äôs been a great nudge to make sure I actually spend time on things like reading or painting.

**2. Google Keep**  
This is my go-to for checklists and notes. My partner and I use shared notes for things like groceries (organized by sections of the market) and household tasks. It‚Äôs simple but effective, and it helps us stay efficient even when we‚Äôre working opposite schedules.

**3. ScreenZen & Block Apps**  
To keep a healthy digital diet, I‚Äôve blocked Instagram and Facebook from 8 PM to 9 AM using the Block app. ScreenZen limits me to 7 minutes of use per hour on these apps, stopping rabbit holes before they start. Reddit is capped at 45 minutes a day‚Äîjust enough to get value without losing hours. This setup keeps me intentional with my screen time.

**4. YT Subscriptions Only**  
I turned off YT Watch History, and it‚Äôs been a game-changer. Without the suggested videos, I‚Äôve stopped getting sucked into reels or random content. Now, I only go to my subscriptions page, which I‚Äôve curated to align with my interests. For example, I follow channels that focus on outdoor skills, productivity tips, or fitness routines. It‚Äôs like a clean slate every time I open the app.

**5. ChatGPT for Planning**  
I‚Äôve started using ChatGPT to plan my days more intentionally. I‚Äôve input my values, goals, and quirks into its memory, so when I send it my evening to-do list, it can create a personalized schedule for me. It‚Äôll even format it into a time-blocking plan I can plug into Google Calendar. For example, if I list my tasks‚Äî‚Äúgym, get ready for bike trip, dinner prep, ‚Äù‚Äîthis is what it suggests:

# Morning

* **7:00 AM:** Wake up, morning routine (breakfast, quick mindfulness, journaling).
* **7:30 AM:** Organize bikepacking gear, check checklist, and make final shopping list.
* **8:00 AM:** Reflective hobby session (20‚Äì30 minutes of painting or journaling).
* **9:00 AM:** 10K Zone 2 run (\~5:00-5:15/km).
* **10:15 AM:** Snack, shower, and review any progress on self-guided fitness (e.g., check lifting or running logs).

# Midday

* **12:00 PM:** Market run to get bikepacking supplies and food (e.g., snacks, fuel, map).
* **1:30 PM:** Lunch and quick reflection on fitness goals and trip prep.
* **2:00 PM:** Explore a local food business in Preston for a taste of your area.
* **2:30 PM:** Inspect bike (check tires, brakes, chain, and gear). Test pack gear and adjust for comfort.

# Afternoon

* **3:30 PM:** Reflect on goals (writing, self-growth check-in). Plan for upcoming Spartan Race.
* **4:30 PM:** Hydrate and ensure everything is packed for the trip. Organize gear by function (e.g., cooking, repair, etc.).

# Evening

* **6:00 PM:** Dinner (high carb meal). Share an intentional moment with Wife (e.g., talk about the trip or other shared goals).
* **7:00 PM:** Final bikepacking prep (ensure maps, navigation, and hydration packs are ready).
* **8:00 PM:** Relax with a light hobby (e.g., painting, reading *Nexus*).
* **9:30 PM:** Bedtime, focus on rest for the adventure.

This approach has given me some of my most productive days‚Äînot busy for the sake of being busy, but productive in a way that includes downtime and hobbies. Scheduled relaxation time makes it easier to truly unwind.

# Below are some habits I've used that have had the most impact:

**1. No Phone in the Bedroom**  
For years now, I‚Äôve kept my phone out of the bedroom. It‚Äôs saved me countless late-night scrolling sessions. My alarm goes off at 6 AM, but my body clock‚Äôs so tuned in that I often wake up a couple of minutes early and grab my phone before it disturbs my partner. This habit has been foundational for better sleep and mornings.

**2. Evening Journaling & To-Do Lists**  
Every evening, I write a quick journal entry and a simple to-do list for the next day. The notebook sits by my phone, so when I turn off the alarm in the morning, my list is right there. I always start with a few easy wins, like ‚Äúdrink coffee‚Äù or ‚Äúshower‚Äù‚Äîsmall victories to get the ball rolling in the morning. I‚Äôll also add some nice things, like ‚Äúkiss wife‚Äù or ‚Äúenjoy ride to work,‚Äù.

# Physical and Mental Health:

**1. Exercise**  
I exercise daily, whether it‚Äôs cycling to work, trail running, mountain biking, or hitting the gym. My job is pretty physical, but I find consistent exercise outside of work is essential for my mental health. It also helps burn off the excess energy that comes with ADHD. The variety in my work and workouts keeps me engaged; routine-heavy environments don‚Äôt suit me as well.

**2. Meditation (On & Off)**  
Meditation has been helpful in the past, but it‚Äôs not always consistent for me. Sometimes focusing on quieting my mind backfires, giving my thoughts an empty stage to get louder. I‚Äôll go through phases where it‚Äôs daily, and other times I‚Äôll skip it entirely.

Cultivating a healthy digital and mental ‚Äúdiet‚Äù takes maintenance. For example, I regularly prune my YT subscriptions or Instagram follows to make sure I‚Äôm consuming content that aligns with my goals and values. It‚Äôs a constant process of tweaking what works and letting go of what doesn‚Äôt.

Of course, this is all best-case scenario. Sometimes habits fall off the rails, and that‚Äôs fine. I see it as an experiment: what works today might not work tomorrow. At the end of the day, productivity is about what works for *you*. My approach might seem intense, but it keeps my mind calmer and more focused. That said, nothing here is fixed‚Äîit‚Äôs all about experimenting and adjusting.

That‚Äôs my system‚Äîhopefully, it‚Äôs helpful to someone out there!

**Dr. November Harding**

*A forensic psychologist hiding an unhealthy obsession with a local serial killer she assisted the FBI in apprehending.*

Most of your consulting work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been out of the resident agency in Annapolis. However in MAR 1999, you‚Äôre asked to lecture on developments in forensic psychology to a group of veteran and novice agents at the FBI Field Office in Windsor Mill, Baltimore County.

At the conclusion of the lecture, over lukewarm coffee and stale donuts, you‚Äôre approached by a pleasant-mannered agent in his late-thirties. Special Agent Gary Hall has the odd combination of boyish good looks and greying hair, but he‚Äôs warm and welcoming, something several of the other agents apparently missed the memo on. Hall even comments on the other agents‚Äô rudeness. *Most of them remember the Revolutionary War better than the Reformation*, he says, which you interpret as a (bad) joke about the continuing influence of Protestant Christianity on the Bureau‚Äôs leadership and culture.

He explains that he works the organised crime desk for Maryland and Delaware, researching the possible remnants of the Gambino crime family in Baltimore. He gushes about your lecture, and asks several intelligent questions about your work. Finally he excuses himself, telling you that‚Äôs it‚Äôs been a real pleasure. You get the sense he means it.

You think nothing of Hall until well over a year later, in NOV 2000. He calls your office, and tells you he‚Äôs in Annapolis for the day. He asks to meet at a bar and grill in Eastport, just off Chesapeake Avenue. It‚Äôs a dingy, nautical-themed joint of no discernible quality, and you‚Äôre confused as to why he chose it. A small part of you wonders if he‚Äôs about to propose an extra-marital affair, or something equally embarrassing.

But he‚Äôs not alone when you arrive. He sits with a kind-eyed, raven-haired woman in her late-forties. She‚Äôs in civilian dress, but a security lanyard for the Naval Academy, one suburb over, hangs from her neck. Hall introduces her as Lena Garner, then orders beer and lobster rolls. As you eat, Garner peppers you with questions as to your work and research. Like Hall, she‚Äôs friendly and unassuming. You‚Äôre still waiting for the ball to drop.

Finally Hall drains the last of his beer, pushes the last soggy roll your way, and gets to the point. He and Garner are part of what he describes as an ‚Äúinter-agency taskforce‚Äù. The work is classified, and the security clearance is one most law-enforcement officials have never even heard mentioned. *Would you be interested in doing some consulting on the side? The pay isn‚Äôt great*, he admits. *But the subject-matter should be interesting to you*, adds Garner. *Research into abnormal psychology, that sort of thing. Very complex profiles. Arthur Brian Justice has one of those, right?*

You stop chewing. Your work on the taskforce created to investigate Justice is a matter of public record, but the way she says it‚Ä¶it‚Äôs as though she knows your involvement with Justice hasn‚Äôt exactly concluded.

And she shouldn‚Äôt know that. She really shouldn‚Äôt.

A week later a courier brings you a package. It contains instructions on how to set up a new email address using encrypted servers created specifically for Hall‚Äôs ‚Äútaskforce‚Äù. It also contains a copy of a recently published academic work: *Castration and the Heavenly Kingdom: A Russian Folktale* \[Engelstein, Laura (1999), Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press\]. The title page is inscribed: Start Here. G.H.

The instructions come from Garner to your new email address. The Skoptsi (Russian: —Å–∫–æ–ø—Ü—ã, ‚Äúeunuch‚Äù) were a cult within the larger Spiritual Christianity movement in the Russian Empire. Their members were best known for practising self-emasculation (by male members) and self-mastectomy and self-genital mutilation (by female members) in accordance with their teachings against sexual lust. The sect emerged in the late 18th century, peaked in popularity in the early 20th century, and was wiped out by the Soviet Union under Stalin.

Garner asks that you use modern profiling to classify the major personality and behavioural characteristics of a theoretical member of the Skoptski living at the end of the 19th century. What possible use this could be to contemporary law enforcement escapes you, but you complete the task within a month, and you complete it well. Garner is pleased, and tells you that she and Hall will be in touch soon.

As of 3 FEB 2001, you have not heard from them.

**Roman Borowicz**

*A information security consultant (i.e. a hacker) who has recently opened shop in Baltimore.*

MAR 1998. The phone rings in the office of the newly formed Combinatoric Malfeasance. It‚Äôs not much of an office, just a couple of rooms filled with boxes above a crab cake place in Fells Point, Baltimore.

‚ÄúBorowicz?‚Äù Female voice. Professional-sounding.

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù.

‚ÄúOn a scale of one-to-ten,‚Äù the voice says, ‚Äúhow well would you say you understand physics?‚Äù

A beat. ‚ÄúWho referred you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have experience in theoretical mathematics?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù you respond. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that got to do with‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks for your time‚Äù. The line goes dead.

You work for an hour, put the weird call from your mind. Head downstairs to try the crap cakes. They‚Äôre dry as hell. When you get back upstairs, the phone‚Äôs ringing again.

‚ÄúHow much experience in theoretical mathematics?‚Äù

Twenty minutes later you‚Äôre in a town car with your kit packed, being taken by a mute driver to a tired apartment complex in Montebello, near the university. A man in his late-thirties, wearing an FBI windbreaker, meets you at the door. He leads you to a first-floor studio apartment that screams ‚Äúsingle and hating it‚Äù. On a desk stacked with fantasy computer games (*Diablo, Return to Krondor, The Elder Scrolls*) there‚Äôs a running PC.

‚ÄúCan you get me into this?‚Äù

He clocks your glance at the letters emblazoned on his windbreaker, a glance that says: *Don‚Äôt you have somebody on your payroll can take care of this?*

‚ÄúHard to get someone from the Bureau out this time of night,‚Äù he says, and laughs. It‚Äôs the middle of the day.

You shrug, get him in. Then he asks you to get into the owner‚Äôs AOL account, and find an email from three days ago, sent by someone named Michael Wei. The name‚Äôs familiar, but you can‚Äôt place it. You find it, a message to mathgeeks@listbrain, a group which apparently includes the owner of this PC. The email‚Äôs headed: ‚ÄúLaqueus puzzle solved!‚Äù.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt read it,‚Äù the Fed says. ‚ÄúJust check it wasn‚Äôt sent on, wipe it, and make sure anyone looking at this can‚Äôt get it back.‚Äù

You leave Montebello with a mess of questions and nine hundred bucks in your back pocket. Watching the news that night, you remember where you know the name Michael Wei from. Three days ago Wei, who had no criminal history, executed all seven members of the Ridgeway family in their home in Alliance, New Jersey with a stolen shotgun, before blowing his own head off. No motive or connection to the Ridgeway family has been found.

That‚Äôs not the bit that sends a shiver down your spine. It's when the reporter reveals Wei was a grad student in mathematics at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University, New York.

A month later you run into the Fed again, in the crab cake place below your office. It‚Äôs not a coincidence. Says he feels he owes you an explanation. Thing is, he‚Äôs part of this covert cyber-crime unit being run between the NSA, the FBI and ONI. Inter-agency cooperation‚Äôs a beautiful thing. What would you say to helping out from time to time?

He‚Äôs full of shit. You‚Äôve worked the intelligence community. Inter-agency cooperation doesn‚Äôt exist.

He flashes you his boyish smile. Thing is, he knows he‚Äôs full of shit. And he knows you know it. He just wants to know if you‚Äôll call him on it, or if you‚Äôre coming along for the ride, wherever the hell it‚Äôs going.

*Michael Wei. Laqueus Puzzle. Seven dead in Alliance.*

Yeah, you‚Äôre along for the ride.

That‚Äôs how you end up moonlighting for Special Agent Gary Hall and his partner Lena Garner. Garner‚Äôs late forties, a retired naval intelligence officer. She sets up a seperate email for you, using encrypted servers created specifically for Hall‚Äôs ‚Äúunit‚Äù. Their requests come just a couple times a year, with little warning, and with even less detail. Pull the financials for some company incorporated in Colorado. Make a copy of some pastor in New Mexico‚Äôs schedule for the next two weeks. Get a list of employees from some political thinktank in Bountin, Maryland, a few counties over. You have questions, a lot of them. But you never ask them. It‚Äôs just another job, after all. One you happen to be damn good at.

As of 3 FEB 2001, you haven‚Äôt heard from Special Agent Gary Hall or Lena Garner in two months.

**Dr. Ed Blackwell**

*A forensic physician with Annapolis PD who is carrying out a llicit  affair with a local escort.*

They pull the body out of the Severn, just where it meets Chesapeake Bay. Everyone‚Äôs saying accidental drowning, and you‚Äôve got no reason to think otherwise. Alexander Lonisky, male, nineteen years old, dropout from the United States Naval Academy. Probably drunk. Someone needs to confirm it though. Someone needs to tick those boxes.

And he did drown, despite the complete lack of alcohol in his blood. But that‚Äôs not the weird thing. The weird thing is the tattoos. Stick-and-poke with ink from a ballpoint. The three lines on each side of the body, just above the coxal, that kind of look like gills. And the scratchy block letters, horror-movie stuff, below the left pectoral:

HOME DAGON HOME

HOME YHANTHLEI

SEA TO THE SEA

You note everything down in your report, put the body on ice, and clock out for the night. It‚Äôs the middle of winter, 1998. It‚Äôs late. Probably too late, she‚Äôs probably asleep, but maybe you should try calling anyway‚Ä¶

Someone‚Äôs waiting for you at your car. He introduces himself as Special Agent Gary Hall, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and he‚Äôs got the paper to prove it. Says he already spoke to your boss, says he‚Äôs come a long way to be here, then laughs. All the way from the Bureau Field Office in Baltimore. He‚Äôs not funny, but he‚Äôs got pleasant manners and seems genuinely apologetic for taking up your time. He just wants five minutes on Lonisky, so you give it to him.

You give him the headlines: cause of death, no booze, the weird ink. He nods, seems unsurprised. Makes another bad joke about preferring red ink when he writes, that it grabs the reader‚Äôs attention. Then he asks if you wouldn‚Äôt might leaving the tattoos out of your report. It‚Äôd really help him out with something he‚Äôs working on.

It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúno‚Äù once you‚Äôre over the shock. Annapolis PD doesn‚Äôt have the best relationship with the Feds, and you‚Äôre not about to make it worse. He asks if you‚Äôre sure, and you absolutely are. He nods again. *O.K.,* he says. *No problem. Thanks again for your time. Have a good night. Then he‚Äôs gone.*

On your doorstep the next morning you find an unwelcome copy of one of the local rags, sitting atop the Capital Gazette. One of the pages is dogearred. In the winter dawn, standing outside in your dressing gown, you flip it open to the classified section. Adult Services, ‚Äúcall me now‚Äù and all that. Of course, you can get more than just conversation by dialling any of these numbers, if you know what to say.

One of the numbers is circled - in red ink. It‚Äôs a number you know well, so well you don‚Äôt even need to write it down anymore. In fact, you called it last night‚Ä¶

You leave the tattoos out of your report.

Six months later, you meet Special Agent Gary Hall for a second time, in line for a sandwich on Amos Garrett. You get the feeling it‚Äôs a not a coincidence. He offers to buy you lunch, and for some reason you accept.

He‚Äôs sorry about the whole report mess. Thing is, he‚Äôs part of this classified working group set up by the Bureau. Can‚Äôt even tell his wife about it. Issues of national security, that sort of thing. What would you say to helping out from time to time?

You‚Äôre not sure you have a choice. But you‚Äôre also not sure that you‚Äôd refuse, even if you did. Because you‚Äôre interested, and because you certainly don‚Äôt plan on being with the PD forever. Nothing wrong with planning for the future.

And it turns out Hall is pretty respectful of your time. A week later a courier brings you a package. It contains instructions on how to set up a new email address using encrypted servers created specifically for Hall‚Äôs ‚Äúworking-group‚Äù. He‚Äôll get in touch every six months, usually just to get your medical opinion on something. He leaves out most of the details, or why he needs the information. It‚Äôs all pretty banal, disappointingly so, and you often find yourself wondering about the meaning of those strange words, set to flesh‚Ä¶

As of 3 FEB 2001, you have not heard from Special Agent Gary Hall in three months.",6,1736403417.0,DeltaGreenRPG,0,1.0,False
