\*TITLE: OREOS AND LATE STAGE CAPITALISM\*



CHAPTER 1: OREOS, THE IDEA



I don’t need to sit you down like a parent explaining how people have sex to explain to you what oreos are, because there’s a staggering chance you’re either eating them or thinking about eating them. That’s because, admittedly, they taste pretty good. But, there are better cookies, healthier, cheaper, and more ethical that you will never taste. Sure, I can drive 30 minutes to Grandma’s Bakery to get cookies with genuine effort, or I can drive to the Wallgreen’s 2 minutes away for schlop cookies made with child labor and stuff you can’t pronounce. Whether you like it or not, all Americans are stuck in a hellscape where they are forced to support genocidal companies that should never exist in the first place. But, let’s be fair, maybe the children slaving away for pennies put a lot of effort and creativity into these cookies, let’s take a look!



CHAPTER 2: OREOS, THE COOKIE



It started off with a basic cookie, simple, clean, looks like a manhole cover from the top down, but of course, you aren’t here for the brown bits that make up the actual cookie, you’re simply here for the cream. There is double stuf, yes spelled S T U F, because innovation is when you remove a letter and add more cream, triple stuf, triple double stuf, mega stuf, and most stuf, just in case your gluttony wasn’t satisfied. Do Americans really need a pipe to feed them ‘Stuf’? Also why do they name the cookies like RPG skills? Of course, there are Oreo thins! The illusion that you’re eating healthier! I’m sure the 18 calorie difference really shows when you shovel them into your mouth watching Young Sheldon. OH, AND HOW COULD I FORGET. THE FUCKING FLAVORS.



CHAPTER 3: THE FUCKING FLAVORS



In case you wanted to celebrate your gluttonous, capitalistic country with each bite, there are red white and blue oreos that look more French than anything. Brownie batter, Ultimate Chocolate, and Chocolate Hazelnut, 3 different products all with the same intention of telling you, “Hey, we put chocolate in the middle instead of fucking cream.” Oreo Peeps, Red Velvet, and Birthday Cake, in case you were such a glutton that you needed your dessert cookie to taste like other deserts. (Seriously, there are so many other desert flavors it would be a waste of your time to name them.) Dunkin Donuts coffee, a conglomerate crossover so great it rivals smash bros. Ginger bread, 2 varieties of peppermint, and Hot Cocoa, just to make sure your holidays are EXTRA commercial. Lady Gaga, Blackpink, I hope they taste like the music feels, that could be redeemable. This isn’t even ACCOUNTING for the various products that aren’t cookies. Why can’t they make other cookies? Why don’t they have 1,000,000 flavors for things that aren’t oreos? I mean who even owns this? \*search results show mondelez\* OH MY FUCKING GOD. SOMEONE CALL A PRIEST.

That is, until this week. I’ve noticed my bus commute is wayyy quicker. What used to be a 45 minute ride into the city is now barely 30.

Even my walk from the bus stop to work has gotten faster. It was warmer today, so I actually ditched the bus altogether and just walked to work from home. Didn’t even break a sweat running 4-5 miles! I do get pretty hungry afterward though, like I-could-eat-a-rat hungry haha. Just kidding.

My sleep is better too, maybe because there’s less honking? I work second shift so getting up was always a problem for me, but it’s like as soon as the moon comes up I’m full of energy. No more coffee or energy drinks for me!

There are also some not-so-good changes though. TMI, but I’m getting hairier. Like A LOT hairier. Everywhere. If I don’t wax daily it gets pretty crazy, but I guess that’s just the Eastern European in me.

Anyway, just wanted to see if anyone else noticed these changes?

Edit: I could use a good mani/pedi if anyone has a recommendation. My nails are getting looooong.

1hxs46t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1hxs46t/the_old_ones/,The Old Ones,"I only ever had one distinct ESP experience in my life at that point. I was studying  Abenaki history in Northern VT and lived in a very remote area. One moonlit night I was taking the long way home on Route 15 along the Lamoille river.  

It was a supermoon and lit up the night almost like it was day, I had rolled a joint of some pretty good stuff and was looking for a pull out to toke up. The valley was long and dark with few dwellings. I found my pull out and got out of the car and took a hit or two and took in the cool early spring night air and looked into the distance appreciating the beauty and the mystery.

As I stood there a loud clear voice said somewhere in the middle of my mind ""We are the Old Ones and we have lived here always"", ""We have always lived around the Great Lakes"".

I stood there somewhat amazed as nothing like that had ever happened to me before and it left me puzzling. The night remained the same beautiful mysterious night but now I had a question. Who were the Old Ones that had just communicated with me?

There seemed to be a couple of possibilities. I was studying under an Abenaki ambassador the Abenaki tribe up in Swanton and I knew that some Native peoples claim to have always lived here as an origin story, could it be them? It seemed the most likely.

Was it a spirit of a Native ancestor long gone reaching out from beyond the grave? Algonquian people had lived around the Great Lakes although the Western Abenaki had lived around Lake Chaplain, but this was considered by geologists to be one of the Great Lakes although it is not included in the standard 5 traditionally.

The other option was another strange encounter I had with a giant aquatic animal that was considered extinct during the last ice-age. Perhaps he was the old one? An ancient animal that could talk to my mind. But that was a decade before and 120 miles away so why now? Of course this type of animal did live around the Great Lakes historically and there are many sightings at this latitude of the same even to this day. 

These were my two options it seemed and for several decades I thought back to that evening and rolled over the question of who were these old ones and what did that all mean, anyway?

Then one day I was driving through a very old archeological area that had deep history in what I will call deep time, all the way back to the last Ice Age. 

There was a Dunkin's and I thought to get a coffee. As the Dunkin's was coming up on my right I passed a small yard sale and my intuition must have kicked in and though I did not see more than a few trinkets I got a strong desire to pull in. As I had just passed it I thought, NAW, but still something made me spin the wheel around into a U turn. I often had impulses to pull into yard sales after I pass them and I always just kept going but this one time I didn't.

As I got out of the car to look over the wares on the table the owner approached me.

As they got closer I was taken aback, is this real? A type of person that I considered to not be possible was standing beside me and looking at me and we conversed for awhile. I had many question but did not want to appear to be impolite and learned as much of them as I could through casual conversation. The person knew why I was there, I had been called decades before. As I reflect on that meeting now and as I have thought about it over the last few days and weeks I realize now, I had met one of the Old Ones.

1hxs0yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1hxs0yb/manifesting_works_better_than_the_12_steps_for_me/,Manifesting Works Better than the 12 Steps for Me,"I used drugs for nine years, went to rehab four times, and tried everything possible to quit. 

I tried hypnosis and therapy. Nothing worked for more than a few days. 

I even tried a 12-step program. This worked the best of everything I tried until manifesting. It got me 18 months sober. I even sponsored other people and took them through the 12 steps. 

Unfortunately, I used drugs again, and I was right back to square one. I was beating my head against the wall trying to think how I could quit. 

That’s when I discovered the law of attraction. I immediately put it into action and started meditating and manifesting. 

After just a few meditation sessions I found that drugs were losing a lot of their appeal, but I was still using them as a habit. So I kept manifesting: 

I would picture my life as a happy, productive, *healthy* person. How would I feel when I got out of bed in the morning? What kind of people would I be friends with? What kind of words would I use to describe myself when people asked me about myself?

As I continued meditating and manifesting, I reached a few key turning points:

* I stopped applying the word “addict” to myself, or even the word “sober.” This was not done to minimize or excuse my problematic behavior — I did it to get out of the mental trap I was in, where I thought of myself as an “addict,” which made me feel shame, which made me want to use drugs to escape the shame. **Instead of saying “I’m sober,” I started saying “I’m healthy.”** People who are not addicts never say they’re “sober.” Saying i was “sober” actually kept the problem alive,  because I was still defining myself in relation to substance abuse. Saying “I’m a healthy guy” works much better for me. 

* I stopped swearing off everything forever. As an AA member I was taught total abstinence (other than coffee and nicotine, lol) — so I had programmed myself to think of the situation in a black and white way, and demand total perfection / complete abstinence from myself. When I failed, I would feel shame, which made me want to use drugs to escape the shame — so I stopped seeing total abstinence as the ideal. Instead, I started seeing myself as someone who has a drink here and there. I’ve never had a dependence on alcohol so it wasn’t a risky bet to see myself that way. 

* I stopped seeing substance abuse as a “demon to conquer.” I started to see it as a phase that I would naturally outgrow. 

* **The biggest shift came when I started to view myself as someone who had *already* outgrown substance abuse.** I didn’t realize it, but that’s when I started employing “the law of assumption.” Instead of seeing it as a problem I was having in the here and now, I started seeing it as a problem I *used* to have, and that I had already outgrown. 

It’s been three years since I abused substances, so manifesting has officially worked better for me than 12-step groups, which only got me 18 months.

I’m not some big hater who has an axe to grind about 12-step groups. **AA (and other groups) can save lives, and it was the second most effective thing I’ve ever tried.**

However, I do believe that for some people, like myself, being part of a 12-step group can actually keep the problem alive because being part of it forces you to think about it all the time, and forces you to always consider it a present struggle rather than allowing it to be a struggle you used to have in the past and naturally outgrew. 

Feel free to ask any questions you have, I enjoy helping other people outgrow their problematic substance use. ",2,1736469637.0,lawofattraction,0,1.0,False

Little Joe came huffing up the stairs, carrying an armful of fluffy, turquoise towels. “You can shower and get cleaned up. Get some dry clothes. You can have them off those racks over there. Take whatever you need. Probably all went out of fashion ten years ago anyway. I haven’t sold anything since the truckers stopped coming.” He slapped down a pair of scissors in front of the Greta. “Have at it, sister.”

The woman pressed her hands together and raised them over her head.

“Our mother the Earth… When you’re all done, I’ll nuke some hot dogs, and we can drink hot cocoa and tell ghost stories. Indians tell the best ghost stories. Ain’t that right, Francis?”

Francis shrugged, eyes still locked on the floor.

“I bet you have a story to tell, don’t you, kid? I bet the stories you could tell would make all our hairs turn gray.”

Little Joe sniffed the air. “Maybe you can go first,” he said to the Greta. He moved to leave but stopped. “No phones, AR glasses, anything that gets online.”

“Comstock took mine,” Alan said.

“I left mine at the department,” said Gwen.

“Haven’t used a damn phone since I went off the grid thirty years ago,” said Nash.

“Good, you can use these.” From a denim pocket, Little Joe handed a pink phone to Alan and a red one to Gwen. “Pink for the shrink, red for the red.” He laughed. “They won’t be able to track these. You can use them on my internet, but if you use them from a Wi-Fi, like at a coffee shop, and you log into your social media, they’ll be able to pinpoint you within a few minutes.” He eyed each suspiciously while adding, “Do not log into fucking social media.”

Alan turned the device over in his palm. It was much fatter than any phone he’d ever used.

“You like that, doc? Made them myself. Good old reservation craftsmanship. There’s a market for anonymity these days. Militias can’t get enough of them.”

“I should call Comstock,” Gwen said, “and explain what happened.”

Nash chuckled. “Whatcha gonna say? That you were attacked by werewolves?”

“You should call him, Deputy Wolf,” said Little Joe, “and listen to his words. If he’s part of this, you’ll know it.”

“I don’t even know what _this_ is. How could he be part of this? He’s acting sheriff.”

She put the phone on speaker and dialed. It rang for half a minute.

“Hello, Lake County Sheriff’s Department. How can I help you?” said a woman’s voice.

“Hello, Sheriff Comstock, please?”

“May I ask who’s calling?”

Alan nodded when she looked at him. “It’s… Deputy Gwen Wolf.”

There was a pause. “One moment, please.”

The line switched to an old Christmas song, “I’ll be home for Christmas.”

“Gwen? Where the hell are you?” There was a quiver in Comstock’s voice.

“I’m okay. I’m alright,” Gwen said. “The department was attacked.”

Another pause.

“What do you mean, attacked?”

“I mean, attacked. By people with wolves or trained attack dogs. Comstock, listen to me. This is going to sound crazy. I think they were werewolves.”

Alan could hear muffled voices in the background.

“Damn right it was attacked. Someone busted out that shrink and the boy.”

“Comstock, people died.”

“Goddamn right they did. I’ve got six dead deputies here.”

“Oh my God, all six?”

“And dead Gretas everywhere.”

The tall Greta hid her face with cloth-covered hands.

“Ambushed. Gunshot wounds to the head. Assassination style. It takes a real sick bastard—”

“No, there were no gunshot wounds. They were attacked by animals.”

“Bullshit. You need to come in right now. The FBI’s on the way.”

“I told you! We saw them. One of the deputies, I saw him attacked. Check the CCTV.”

“CCTV was offline. Come in now. We can help you. Is the boy with you?”

“No,” she said flatly. Her trembling emerald eyes locked on Alan.

“Gwen, help us get the boy back. We have reason to believe he could be in some danger. Perhaps some sort of grooming by this Dr. Smith.”

“Comstock, that’s ridiculous, and you know it. I can’t come in until I figure out what’s going on.”

“I know Dr. Smith and the kid are with you. I also know you helped them kill the deputies, _my_ deputies.”

“No! We didn’t! It was the wolves!”

A long pause and a series of beeps and clicks.

“Where are you calling us from?”

“I have to go.”

“The only wolf is you, Wolf.” There was a sneer in Comstock’s voice. “You got nowhere to run. We’re going to find you. We’re going to find that fucking boy.”

Gwen ended the call with a shaking finger. She looked at them all and said, “I don’t know what’s happening.”

“He was lyin,” Nash stated.

A pall passed over the group, quiet as the Greta herself. From downstairs, there was a loud _DING_. Alan’s heart jumped.

“Hot dogs are ready!”

Little Joe brought them each a large hot dog in a fluffy bun smothered in mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, and relish, along with a steaming mug of hot chocolate.

Alan chewed carefully with his swollen lip. It was the best hot dog he’d ever eaten. The meat was hot and juicy, and the bun was soft and warm.

Francis scraped off the fixings before devouring his.

“I gotta say, Lil’ Joe, you do make a gourmet _dawg_,” the hippie complimented.

“Papa Joe’s secret recipe. Remove from package, microwave for three minutes.”

When they’d finished eating, they all sat in the soft booth, drinking their hot chocolates. Francis leaned his head against Alan’s shoulder. He wanted to pull the child into his arms, rock him, and say that he would protect him from the world. But he could merely sit there with his heart beating. The father who had never been. He was no defender. He was not wise.

The Greta sat cross-legged on the floor across the room, her back against the wall, a neon _BEER_ sign shining down on her as she cut up a black t-shirt.

The hippie leaned against the cardboard, and Little Joe had pulled in one of the comfortable chairs from the TV room and was reading something on his phone.

“The National Weather Service just declared emergency travel only for all of Lake and Flathead counties. Seven to twelve inches by morning, and it looks like the temperature is going to drop tonight. Minus forty.”

“_Sweeeeet_ Lord,” exclaimed Nash. As if on cue, a gust of wind shook the side of the building. “I say we stay cozy as peas in a pod here.”

Gwen laid her head on the table. “I’m so tired, but I doubt I could sleep.”

“We’re all going to need sleep. But not all at once. We’ll need to keep watch,” Little Joe said.

“Keep watch?” Alan questioned. He realized that he was probably in a state of shock. The events at the jail, the accident on Main Street, they felt like scenes from a movie and not something that had actually happened. Yet Gwen’s call to Comstock had confirmed the authorities, including the FBI—if Comstock could be believed—were looking for them as suspects in the murders of the deputies and the Gretas.

Francis pulled his hoodie tight around his head. Poor kid. He had warned them, hadn’t he? He tried to tell Alan about the scars on his body, about the hunters.

“Doc,” said Carter Nash, “I think we need to seriously consider our situation here and start cookin up a plan.”

“Fuck, Nash, I don’t know what the hell happened,” Alan said.

“Well, you did go up to see White Owl, didn’t you?” asked Little Joe.

“I did,” said Alan.

“No offense against White Owl, but there’s a reason she lives up there in a rock and no one ever visits her.”

“Who’s White Owl?” asked Gwen.

“She’s the woman Francis has been living with.”

“She’s a damn witch,” Little Joe interjected, “and trouble finds her wherever she goes. And trouble finds you too, boy.” He pointed a fat finger at Francis.

“Sorry,” mumbled Francis, looking down at the tabletop.

“It’s not your fault,” said Alan.

“It _is_ my fault,” the boy persisted. “If I hadn’t given the concert, nobody would have died. They always come when I sing.”

“The hunters?” asked Gwen.

Francis nodded.

“Those things,” said Alan, “Do you know why they come?”

“Werewolves, call em what they are,” said Nash.

“They want to kill me. They want to kill the Maji.” His voice was soft and lost. “White Owl told me never to sing unless I have a plan to escape. I’m sorry. I didn’t have a plan in the jail.”

“Who are the Maji?” Gwen asked.

“We are,” said Francis, weak of voice.

Nash took a piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolded it. It was one of the posters. “Builds A Fire Brings the Rain,” he read. “You sure did make it rain. I guess when it rains, it pours. Gotta say though, little guy, your music, it’s… I don’t know how to talk about it. It’s magic, sure as Heaven.”

“Here is where you are,” Little Joe declared. “Hippie, I don’t know anything about you, but Dr. Smith and Deputy Wolf, you two are professional people, logical people, yet here you are holed up in my gas station while the cops are out there looking for you because of some bloody tragedy tonight. And how those poor people died, well, you’re just going to have to believe your eyes. And you’re just going to have to accept that the shit has hit the fan, and things as they are now, are not as they were.”

“Cheers,” said Nash. He lifted his cup aloft, and so did they all, and touched them one to another in solemn recognition of their new reality. The Greta, shrouded in dry black fabric cut from the expired fashions of the Jiffy Stop, curled in a ball on the floor.",1,1736469556.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

*WEEK 6- DAY 1 (20MG)*

Hey guys, welcome back to my daily log. Today was a bit of a rollercoaster, but I'll take you through it.

I woke up at 5 AM, but not because I'm a morning person or anything. Nope, I woke up because I was coughing like crazy. I'm pretty sure I'm coming down with something, but I'm trying not to think about it.

Anyways, I was coughing so much that I couldn't go back to sleep. I tried, though. I lay in bed, hoping that somehow I'd magically fall asleep again. And you know what? It kinda worked. I managed to stay in bed until 9 AM, which is basically a miracle.

Once I got up, I started my morning routine. Took the doggies out, made my bed (gotta keep that routine going), fed them, gave them water, and set up the TVs with some chill music. I even made some breakfast, but I was too lazy to make tea. Yeah, that's how gloomy I was feeling.

Despite the gloominess, I tried to get some stuff done around the house. I started doing laundry, tidying up, and just taking it easy. I mean, when it's raining outside and you're feeling under the weather, what else can you do, right?

But then something magical happened. I took my Prozac around 4 PM, and I also took my Vitamin D supplement. And let me tell you, it gave me a little boost of energy. I was like, ""You know what? I'm gonna clean this entire house!"" And that's exactly what I did.

I finished cleaning around 4:30/5 PM, and the house was sparkling. I mean, it was already pretty clean, but I just wanted to get everything perfect. And it felt so satisfying to get it all done.

After that, I went to the gym with my hubby, and we had a blast. We're trying to get into this whole 'healthy couple' thing, and it's actually really fun.

Today was a bit of a rollercoaster, but it ended on a positive note. Still feeling a bit under the weather, but hoping the Vitamin D supplement will help. Fingers crossed for a better tomorrow.

That's it for today, guys. Thanks for tuning in to my daily log. If you're going through similar stuff, just know you're not alone. And if you're not going through similar stuff... well, just know that you're lucky, and I'm kinda jealous.

Peace out, and I'll catch you guys tomorrow!


*WEEK 6- DAY 2*

I woke up at 9:30 am feeling nice and lazy. After a relaxing morning, I got some household chores done, which felt productive.

The rest of my day was super cozy, but I did get pretty sick, which I think is due to the weather. Despite that, my day went smoothly.

One weird thing that happened was around 8 pm - I got some heart palpitations that felt strange. But I'm fine now!

I skipped the gym tonight since I'm not feeling 100%, but I'm planning to go tomorrow!

Medication update: I took my 20mg Prozac at 4:50 pm today.

That's all for today!


*WEEK 6- DAY 3 (20MG)*

Today was a pretty laid-back day. I woke up feeling extremely lazy and tired, which has been a common theme lately. I've been struggling with fatigue since upping my dose from 15mg to 20mg.

Despite the tiredness, my day wasn't bad. My husband and I went shopping, which actually helped improve my mood. The rainy weather has been making me feel gloomy, but spending time with him was a nice pick-me-up.

I took my medication around 4 pm, earlier than usual, since we had plans to go to the gym and grocery shopping. Thankfully, I didn't experience any side effects after taking it.

One positive benefit I've noticed is that I feel more calm after taking my medication. However, the tiredness and fatigue are still a challenge. I've also been experiencing some physical symptoms like coughing, a stuffed nose, and headaches, which might be due to a mild cold.

Overall, it's been a relaxing day spent with my loved one, and I'm grateful for that.

That's all for today!

WEEK 6- DAY- 5: The Struggle is Real

Hey guys, welcome back to my daily log! Today marks my 5th day of week 6 on Prozac, and I'm still alive (barely).

I have to admit, this journey hasn't been easy. Just two days ago, I was feeling like the rainclouds outside had moved into my brain. But today, the sun is shining, and I'm feeling somewhat human again!

My day started at the crack of dawn (5 AM, because who needs sleep?) when I woke up to pee. I'm not sure why my body has decided that 5 AM is the new 3 PM, but I'm rolling with it.

After my hubby left for work, I took the doggies out, fed them, and gave them water. Now they're snoozing away, and I'm enjoying some gaming time. I mean, who needs books when you have video games, right? (Just kidding, I actually miss reading, but my adorable husky, Dougie, had other plans for my book collection... RIP, books.)

Today, I'm planning to do a deep clean of the entire house. I did a quick clean yesterday, but I want to get into all the nooks and crannies today. My hubby will be home around 4 PM, so that's when I'll get started. Wish me luck (and a lot of coffee)!

To anyone who's new here and looking for reassurance, I want you to know that this medication takes time. It's taken me almost 6 weeks to start feeling somewhat normal, and I still have a long way to go. Be patient, and don't be afraid to start with small milligrams. And most importantly, don't let your husky destroy your book collection... trust me on that one.

I hope you all are having a great day, and I wish you the best on your own journeys. Remember to take care of yourselves, stay positive, and laugh at the silly things (like your husky destroying your books... again).

Thanks for tuning in, and I'll catch you all in the next update!


*WEEK 6, DAY 6 (20MG) Brain Fog: Still a Thing!*

Hey guys, welcome back to my journey! Today was a chill day, and I'm not just saying that because I'm on Prozac (although, let's be real, it helps). I woke up early, couldn't sleep, but I felt pretty calm. After taking care of my fur babies, I tidied up the house and organized my bed (yes, I'm a neat freak now).

So, about that brain fog... I'm starting to think it's not just anxiety, depression, and trauma (although, those things don't help). I'm pretty sure my neck instability is contributing to it (hello, therapy sessions!).

On a more positive note, I've been feeling way more confident and free to do my thing without worrying about what others think. I mean, I've been going to the gym since November, and I'm loving every minute of it (well, almost every minute... let's be real, burpees are the worst). My social anxiety used to hold me back, but now I'm all about that yoga life, running, and exercising without caring who's watching.

However, today I did experience some anxiety - mainly heart palpitations, a bit of tightness in my chest, and feeling out of breath. It's not bad, just a little uncomfortable. I'm thinking I might need to adjust my dose, but I'm giving my body time to adjust to the new 20mg dose. I was on 10mg for five weeks and did fine, but now I'm taking the full 20mg pill (no more opening the capsule and taking a fraction of it!). This is my second week on the full dose, and I'm hoping my body will adjust soon.

I've heard that people usually start feeling the full benefits of Prozac around week 7 or 8, so fingers crossed that's my case! If not, I'll be consulting with my doctor next week on the 17th to figure out the next steps.

So, if you're experiencing similar side effects or anxiety, let's chat! Your support and comments mean everything to me.

That's all for today, folks! I'm stoked to have made it to week 6, and I'm excited to see what week 7 brings. Thanks for joining me on this wild ride!



*WEEK 6, DAY FUCKING 7 (20mg)*

Last night was a hot mess. I woke up twice, and my brain was like, ""Hey, let's have 10 different dreams in 5 seconds!"" I'm talking car chases, airplanes, and who knows what else. It was like my brain was trying to win some kind of bizarre dream award.

Anxiety decided to crash the party, too. I've been feeling it especially at night and in the afternoons since upping my medication dose to 20mg. And, of course, my husband and I are both feeling sick, because why not?

Today was a mixed bag. I had zero appetite (thanks, chronic gastritis!), my lips were drier than the Sahara, and I was motivationally challenged after 2:30 PM. But hey, at least my anxiety waited until the afternoon to kick in!

I've also been hitting the gym around 5-6 pm, doing sprint running and cardio. Yeah, I know, it sounds crazy, but I'm trying to keep my anxiety levels in check! The exercise is probably contributing to my tight chest and fatigue, but hey, it's worth it, right?

On a more serious note, I have noticed my intrusive thoughts trying to sneak back in. It's like they're testing the waters, seeing if I'm still on my toes. But I'm not letting them win! I'm staying vigilant, and I'm hopeful that my medication will continue to help me keep them at bay.

Additional symptoms: sore throat (getting better, whatever!), and tiredness (because, hello).

Bring on week 7! I'm ready for some relaxation and maybe, just maybe, some decent sleep.",1,1736469334.0,prozac,0,1.0,False

1hxrw83,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hxrw83/ice_on_my_eyelashes/,Ice on My Eyelashes,"I remember rolling over in my sleeping bag. I blinked once, twice. My vision was blurry, because of the ice on my eyes. If I could see, I would see my breath creating a fog. I couldn’t see though, because it was too cold. Why had I ever pushed myself to this point? 

…

I knew why. I knew my purpose and my dream and exactly why I was here. I blinked the frosted tips from my eyes and I blew my warm breath in to my hands. Warming my frozen digits, I hugged myself to manifest more warmth than I currently possessed. I smiled inwardly. I knew that I lived for this. 

I roused my partner Lena gently. “Hey, wake up. Big day ahead of us.” I smiled as she pulled her bag over her head, as reluctant yet joyful as I knew I was. I sparked the gas stove and spooned our coffee into the metal percolator with intention, feeling the anticipation build within my chest. I paused for a moment, taking in each sensation. Warming coffee, freezing breath, watching the breath rise and fall in my partner’s chest as she slowly rose beside me. Maybe we were lunatics. Actually, we knew we were lunatics.

As the water began to boil for the coffee, seeing the percolating drip, I took out the freeze dried meals and began to boil further water – the last of our water before I would have to boil snow for lunch – and relished the scents. It smelled like joy, it smelled like freedom, and as I’m sure many would agree, it smelled like madness. 

“Lena – we made it love.” I smiled at her warmly, before I unzipped our tent, the lapping shores quietly cascading near to us. “Look at the waves – they look perfect.” 

A gentle breeze flapped the door of our tent, drawing a brisk wind inside to bring us to life. I brushed a hair blown across her face across her brow as I prepped our nourishing coffee. I felt at peace, but I also surged with purpose knowing what was to come. 

“Breakfast of champions angel,” I smiled at her as I served her a freeze dried omelette. “Your appetizer,” I passed her a stiff granola bar and a metal cup of water beside her coffee. “We travel with only the finest!” I poured her a dollop of creamer, the only luxury item we always carried to bolster our spirits.

“You are too kind,” she laughed as she sat up to enjoy her breakfast. 

“I do my best.” 

The wind was kind enough to not exceed a dull howl as we smelled the salt spray from the volcanic beach near to us. We were the first to try and surf the Icelandic volcanic beach. For all our levity, we both knew we were about to challenge a monumental task. 

I sipped my coffee. I again paused to embrace all of this moment. I looked at my beautiful partner. I smelled the aroma of the coffee. Eating my meal, I took a handful of volcanic rock in my hand and crumbled it, watching it fall, feeling the momentous nature of our task before us. I rose, letting Lena clean up our breakfast as I prepared our boards. 

Waxing on, waxing off. Each stroke of the preparation was deliberate, was done with intention. Stroke in succeed, stroke out fear, slide on conquering the unknown, slide off the possibility of failure. 

Lena joined me on the beach and as she dressed, I took in the shore. The waves were just big enough. Not insurmountable. Nothing was insurmountable with her. I helped her zip up the back of her dry suit and donned my own as she did the same. 

I waxed her hair. It was our own routine and unique to us. Most people felt dreadlocks were dirty but hers were nothing more than a mermaid’s locks of incandescent beauty. She could flow anywhere with them. I gently stroked the beads within them and gave her a gentle kiss for reassurance. 

“It’s cold.” She said, smiling at me, clearly nervous. “What are we even doing here? Are we mad?” Laughing, she looked at me for reassurance.

“Mad? If we weren’t mad, we wouldn’t be here my love. Watch for riptides and follow my lead.” I set up the tripod and camera and angled them towards the break.

Attaching her ankle to her board, giving it a further kiss for encouragement and doing the same for mine, I hoisted my board and waded into the freezing sea. 

Breathe in, breathe out. This is how it feels to be alive. I looked back at her with a wink and dove in headfirst, rising up with a yelp “WOOO! YES! C’mon love the water is great!” 

Arm across my board, I pulled myself on it and began to paddle out. YES. This is why we came. This is when I felt most alive. I paddled hard, cresting wave after wave until the shore was safely in my rear view. I had studied map after map to find the safest point for us to surf in the Iceland Sea. I swear I could see Greenland in the distance! 

Lena was still on shore, but I felt the pull of a teaser wave before looking back and seeing a nice crest just begging to be tamed! I pulled and I pulled and I \*snap\* jumped on my board and before I knew it I was OFF cruising! 

“LENA! It’s PERFECT!” I rode, dropping one hand down and dragging it along the surf, picking up speed. “It’s cold but it’s great! C’mon love!!!” 

“WOOHOOO!” I was exhilarated. As the wave was coming to an end near the shore I leaned backwards and dove through the crest to exit the other side, letting my board twist and turn but I wasn’t worried, this surf was great! 

Coming up by the shore, I waded back looking up at my love, who was still waiting. “Lena! Are you okay! It’s perfect c’mon!” 

She looked at me with a look of melancholy I didn’t fully understand. I beckoned her in but she didn’t reply. 

“Okay, well more waves for me!” I paddled out once more seeking a break, and finding the right opportunity I crested again. 

A cross wave came off the shore and unexpectedly knocked me into the surf. It hit me like a bag of bricks and the air left my lungs. I churned in the wave, trying desperately to find my way up. I calmed myself, knowing the strength of the sea and blew my few remaining bubbles to watch them and find my way up. 

Searching desperately, I swam burning for air, but I was tossed again, and again. I grabbed for my ankle tie and pulled but I couldn’t find my way up. Fighting, I took in an accidental gasp and coughed and coughed feeling the freezing water envelope my lungs. Not like this. Not doing what I love…

I awoke freezing, I couldn’t see. I GASPED. The only sound was a quiet beeping. 

“Hello? Hello?” “Oh my God Theo, you’re awake!!!” My sister’s voice? “What? Where am I…?” 

“Theo oh my God” she sobbed, hugging me close. My surroundings became clear to me. I was in a hospital room. My blurred vision became more blurred as I struggled to regain my composure. 

“Sister, where is Lena?” I asked, sobbing.

“Oh Theo… Oh Theo…”

Only silence remained.

I feel like that number might be a little high as I’ve been a little constipated for the last 5 days.   My end goal for weight loss is 210 lbs at which point I plan on continuing this WOE but increasing my intake to 2700-3000 calories.

 I counted my calories the entire time using a food scale and MyNetDiary app. I averaged 2200 calories per day across 3 meals. Approximately 170 of fat, 165 grams of protein and 10g of carbs or less.I was shooting for 70/30 split between fat and protein. At the beginning I was consuming some avocado but I’ve cut that out completely after about a week. I am eating cheese but no milk.

I found that I am sleeping better and have more consistent energy throughout the day. I don’t really  find myself being noticeably hungry at any point throughout the day. I usually eat at at 9 am, coffee and butter, breakfast sausage/bacon and eggs, lunch around 2 pm, typically a ribeye or ground beef with eggs and cheddar cheese, dinner around 7, usually some cheese and 4-5 strips of bacon. 

I’ve noticed that I have dropped in strength at the gym but I’m slowly rebuilding, I’ve lost approximately 15-20% of my weight. During this 30 days I lifted on average 3 times per week and ran on 3-4 days per week, usually on my days I’m not lifting. 

I am supplementing with elecrolytes, creatine and a multivitamin.

In my experience, I find this to be a very easy “diet” to maintain. Everything just tastes to damn good.

# Identify Your Triggers

* **Internal Triggers**: Emotions like stress, boredom, anxiety, or even celebration.
* **External Triggers**: Specific people, places, or situations associated with the habit (e.g., parties, certain times of day, or coffee breaks).
* Keep a journal to log when and why you feel the urge to engage in the habit. This can help you pinpoint patterns.

# Create a Plan to Avoid Triggers

* **Change Your Environment**: Avoid places or people that strongly encourage the habit, especially in the early stages of quitting.
* **Adjust Routines**: If smoking is part of your morning coffee ritual, switch to tea or enjoy your coffee in a different setting.
* **Prepare for Social Situations**: Have a plan to manage urges during events where triggers are likely, like bringing a non-alcoholic drink or chewing gum.

# Replace the Habit with Positive Alternatives

* **Physical Activities**: Exercise, stretching, or even short walks can reduce cravings and release endorphins.
* **Hobbies**: Engage in creative outlets, such as painting, cooking, or playing music, to keep your hands and mind occupied.
* **Healthy Substitutes**: Replace cigarettes with chewing gum, healthy snacks, or fidget toys. Swap alcohol with sparkling water or mocktails.",1,1736468076.0,quittingBadHabits,1,1.0,False

My wife and I have a good relationship.   She is a calming influence on me (I can be impulsive).  She is very smart and good hearted.  She has solidly supported me at every step over the last 15 years.  I have supported her and loved her in every way.

We keep our finances separate at my request- my ex wife did a number on me.  We both make good money and are great with money.

We have had issues.  Mostly, she lives her life like a married woman without kids.  I handled all kid responsibilities in my part of my divorce decree from the kids mom.  Sometimes this can make her oblivious to when I was struggling to get 3 kids to 3 different schools and she was off to get a massage...  it was my responsibility and I never asked her to help so that's on me but I was still a bit resentful. She often compliments me on having been and continuing to be a good dad.  

She can be very cold when her interests and mine collide.  I try to optimize for us, she optimizes for herself.  

Sometimes she doesn't really hear what I am saying.  She is very smart and can often catch on quickly, but sometimes/rarely she completely misses, and it can be hurtful.  We were recently in the car for a 40 minute drive and happened upon a topic very personal to me.  I was driving.  After me saying out what I was feeling, I looked at her to find she was looking at her phone the whole time and hadn't heard a word.  

My wife and I also don't have much fun traveling together.  I like to go off the beaten path, she gets very anxious quickly and likes comfort to the extreme. 

I started a new job within the last year. I manage a team of 12.  One of these is a beautiful married woman (45f). She and I have gotten close over the last few months. 

About 2 months ago I was out of the office for a week.  When I came back, a few of us went to a happy hour.  At the end of the happy hour, it was just the two of us, and my coworker admitted to me she had feelings for me. As we walked out of the bar, we kissed. 

Since then things have escalated.  We have coffee at a nearby Starbucks once every week, lunch or happy hour once a week. She has expensive taste in food. We went and got a couples massage one afternoon and snuggled afterwards.  We both feel like we are living a teenage romance we both missed.  But, no sex. 

She gets me in a way that my wife likely never will. 

We both feel guilty because we both feel we have already cheated.  We are both hesitant to take the final step though. 

The regular coffees and breakfasts and lunches out and happy hours are 80% on me and adding up.  I wonder sometimes if I am just a walking talking credit card, and if the romance is only real from my side??

Not sure what to do.

2. Kind of set in an AU where Izuku is a fairy. Shouta acquires fairy Izuku by a chance of luck and now he is stuck with the fairy till he realises his heart's deepest desires and Izuku can fulfil them.
3. The next part in my Cat, Coffee and Green Beans! series, where Zashi and Nem meet Izu.
4. This one is Erasermic with baby Izu. Shouta is a single dad; Izuku is his baby boy, and all seems fine until a blonde crashes into their lives and stirs things up.

Hi there. I’m m from mn. I am a tall fat dude and I’d say I’m attractive if you like big men. I have long hair I dye various colors and a beard. I’ve also got lots of tattoos and a few piercings as well. For work I manage a coffee shop and make enough to live off of alone. I have tried and dropped out of school 4 times and I don’t think it’s for me due to some mental stuff. I’ve got some mental health shit I’m open about. I love talking about that stuff as well. Now that the boring basic description is done I can talk about why you might want to hit me up!

I am super into film. I love talking about good movies and overthinking what the director was thinking while they directed. Coming up with my own dumb theories and shit. V fun. 

My music taste is eccentric. We should do a Spotify blend to see if we match. My highest match percent has been 79%. I’m into indie/emo/shoegaze/breakcore/hardcore/hiphop. You get so many cool points if your blend match is close to mine lmao. One of my projects is to make a meme slam band.

When I’m not at work I’m usually playing video games on pc at home. Right now I’m grinding the fuck out of path of exile 2 and it’d be great to have someone to do that with. Otherwise I’ve always got league downloaded and am always down for an Elden ring playthrough or smth. Only games I don’t tend to like are mmos like ff14 . I’ll play anything you play other than those. I’d say this is an important thing to have in common as it’s how I spend most of my free time.

I am currently a part of two ttrpgs. A dnd one and one set in the alien universe. They are both mad fun and I’d like to think I have the coolest friends. I also play magic sometimes and want to get back into playing the modern format. Soon I’ll start collecting and painting warhammer 40k as well.

I consume a lot of audiobooks and podcasts. Genres completely vary. I like horror, philosophy, politics, sci-fi and true crime. Lately I’ve been doing a pretentious classics checklist and I am on brave new world atm. If you know the podcast wolf 359 I can tell you were probably soulmates.

When it’s not winter out the outside stuff I like doing consists of fishing and camping. Bringing a small grill and cooking while we fish is like the perfect outside activity. I also like to go to music shows.

I’m looking for a witch. Some version of an alt girl. Someone that might be down to sign her name in satans book. I am a type and I have a type. I have a sword (I lack the armor still unfortunately) and I’m looking to fall victim to a witches treachery. If youre not a witch and you’re just some degenerate terminally online nerd that’s also fine too. I don’t tend to get along with people who don’t share my interests tho.

Anyways if you’ve read this far I just want to thank you for taking time out of your life for making it this far. If I seem interesting to you hmu. I’m seeking a relationship but new friends is fine too!",1,1736467470.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.67,False

For some context, I’m in uni now, and I’m getting a lot of attention from guys, which is new and extremely weird for me. Up until now, I’ve never really experienced romantic interest from guys, so I’m still getting used to it—and I’m having trouble accepting this even though my girl friends acknowledge it as well.

The problem is, out of naivety, I’ll agree to grab coffee with a guy, thinking it’s just to be friends, but then it becomes clear that he has romantic or sexual intentions. When I make it clear I’m not interested in anything beyond friendship, he stops talking to me. It’s frustrating because I just want to make friends, but it feels like that’s not possible with most guys.

More recently, I was asked out for coffee, and because of all these past experiences, I thought maybe if I’m really direct, it’ll work. So I politely thanked him for the invite but said I’m not looking to date at the moment. I felt guilty saying that because, even though I liked him on a friendship level, I felt like it was prideful to assume he was interested in me (in the end it turned out he was indeed interested, which made it even more awkward).

This being said, it kinda worries me bc I’d love to be in a relationship but I would like to first have ‘normal’ friendships, or simply normal interactions w guys bc thus far it’s kinda off-putting and doesn’t feel natural… what should I do?? ",1,1736467391.0,AskMenAdvice,3,1.0,False

-The male was named Sinbad (or something similar)
-Female lead was the focus of most if not all of the series 
-It was oddly Christian? A lot of themes surrounding god and the devil
-Both leads had secret superhero-like identities that came with sprites (kinda like Miraculous Ladybug) and Sinbad was a bit more of a vigilante
-Definitely a love story 
-Something to do with candy? Like a pink, round candy in a dish on the female lead’s coffee table 
-They go to heaven (?) on a mission at the end
-Female lead’s best friend’s dad is a cop and is trying to find the ML and FL

I'm a 26 year old guy, currently studying 3D animation online.  Since all my classes are online only - I've been exploring around various different community colleges around my area; finding good study spots or libraries to get my work done. I hate being cooped up at home all the time (I still live with my parents), and the community colleges around me generally have better hours, more space, and overall better vibes than sitting in a local library or coffee shop all day. I find being in a college environment really helps motivate me and keeps me in a ""college student"" mindset, which I find difficult to achieve in my online classes. It's also been a great source of making friends, meeting fellow artists/like-minded people, and I've even met a couple nice ladies here and there.

Now - I'm just wondering if anyone thinks this is odd? At first, I didn't think much of it, I first started doing this when I was like 22. But now, being 26 (my animation program is taking longer than anticipated), I can't help but feel like I don't belong there or something... am I just overthinking things? I do have bad anxiety. I just don't want students who actually go there to be see me as some creep or loser who just hangs around at a college I don't even attend. Is it strange for me to try and talk to students or befriend them? What about hitting on women? Should I just keep to myself? Or, should I just not give a fuck because after all, I am actually a college student just like them - just not at their particular school.

Guess what? Nothing changed. I was just constantly tired, stuck at an energy level of like 3 or 4 out of 10 the whole time.

I guess I could strike up a conversation over text but I have no idea what to say, without it sounding incredibly random and forced.

anybody have any advice. Do I just stop overthinking and text her, or what?

also when I say meet in person i mean go to an on campus coffee shop.

1hxqzdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1hxqzdv/found_a_diary_entry_from_a_few_months_ago_in_my/,Found a diary entry from a few months ago in my notes app from when I went to France solo for three days on a budget… I am now questioning how my friends put up with this sort of rambling every day 😀,"Wednesday 
Got bus into town then aircoach to airport, arrived around 3:20ish, went through security and had an espresso in the breakfast bar place in the airport, the place began to liven up then as it went on towards 4a.m., bought some protein bars for the plane (3 for 2), boarded, no one sitting next to me, nice.
Flight was nice and I slept for a good bit of it; there was a whole drama with some guy losing his AirPods case, turns out some guy had taken it while he left to talk to his girlfriend and then eventually had to admit it and give them back to him when the guy played a noise to find it and it was literally ringing in the his pocket. So bizarre, like he kept saying ‘that’s so weird how did that get there?’ And all that kinda jazz 🥴
Anyways got out of airport in France, tried to buy a train ticket at the platform but machine wouldn’t accept my tap, sorted my mobile data and everything while having an americano, bought a train ticket on Bordeaux’s transport app, hopped on, validated it, and then sort of hopped off nearby a place that looked like it was central enough. Think it was the Saint-Catherine stop.
There were loads of really nice shops around, it was warm but cloudy but all the buildings were French vibes so I was feeling it coming together already, sat down in a cafe after a browse in the different stores for an americano and to charge my phone. Also peed. Turns out cafe was on Place Saint-Projet which I didn’t know at the time because I was winging it.
Planned out my route while there, first stop was tourist office to get a city pass.
Passed by loads of gorgeous buildings and streets on the way, everything is huge carved limestone and really pretty wrought iron. Literally everything. 
Passed by place de la bourse, a really nice old church, the Grand Théâtre building, the Intercontinental Hotel building, High-Street, etc.
Got my city pass, planned my route on way back to hostel to maximise sights (got out of my jeans in McDonald’s bathroom and into skort - huge help it was so hot outside).
Visited the Grosse Cloche, the Porte Cailhau, the Ponte de Pierre, place de la bourse again, this time from different angle and saw the miroir d’eau, the Musée d’Aquitaine, then did my makeup in the museum bathroom, stopped in the Blarney Stone Irish bar to charge my phone and recuperate (had a glass of wine for €2.50), then on to Cathédrale Saint André and Tour Pey Berland (closed for climbing, might do tomorrow), then went on to the maritime museum (incidentally passed by it and dropped in), the ‘museum du vin et de négoce de bordeaux’ in a historic wine house and cellar, which included a wine tasting session at the end with this lovely girl Lea, she made me try a Cerat or something (edit: claret) and then a Margaux or something, one more tannic than the other, and also told me about the regions around the split river Garonne, and the marshiness/humidity, and tried choc covered raisins and then the same wine to see how it changes taste perception; then on to Cité du Vin which is uber modern and looks boring and like a tourist experience and they said they closed in 45 mins so it wouldn’t be the full experience, so I skipped and probs won’t go to that tomorrow, it’s far away and it looks very skippable. 
Was fairly drunk at this point so I went towards the hostel to check in, stopped in a Carrefour on the way (yay!!) and got yoghurt, protein puddings, salami sticks, and water.
Got to hostel, more runsy downsy vibes around the streets surrounding the hotel even though just a couple streets earlier it had been sooooo nice and pretty and super safe looking. Found out no lock on room doors and at that point it was all looking down from there. But it turns out the woman running it with (presumably) her daughter was lovely, the beds, room and bathroom are really clean and new, had a shower, nice shower, nice hair dryer, forgot face wash had to wash with hand soap yuck. I’m really enjoying it, it’s like a town house and it’s very antiquey in a good way.
Also when I first went up to my room I went into wrong room by accident and had a humorous encounter with a random who was just chilling on his bunk alone in the room. Quickly realised what had happened and left lol.
Chilling and eating now, seeing who’s around - not many lol. Still feeling so relaxed though, doesn’t feel like I didn’t sleep last night and I feel a nice mellow from the wine and sun.
Tomorrows plan is to explore this new area (hadn’t been near it at all today with all the sight seeing so I’m excited to have a look around here), gonna get to know it better, and find a nice place for coffee, then soak up rest of museums I didn’t make it to today before noon, then hop on a train/bus to arcachon for a beach day if weathers looking okay, then come back in evening.
If weather is not permitting, then apparently my mums aunt & uncle live in Blye, or usually are there or something, which is a nice-ish nearby town so I could always make the trip out there instead of the beach.",1,1736466636.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

I’m a barista ,"So this coffee shop I’ve worked at for 4 months has had a lot of sketchy things happen which have made me consider quitting. THIS situation might do it 😬So for info, there is no clock in/clock out here. You’re scheduled for your shift and that’s what you get paid for. Doesn’t matter if you come in earlier and hop in or stay later to help your coworkers. You just get paid what you’re scheduled. So today my shift was 7-9:30am. The owner came in for her shift early and started working on stuff that I had out as more customers came in. Around 9:29/30 I was helping this group that came in, they took a while to order but I helped them, and then made all of their drinks. It was a good size order and they tipped $9. It is time stamped for 9:34. After that, I cashed out and took my card tips for the day which totaled $15. FIFTEEN DOLLARS. That $9 was more than half of what I would have got today.So imagine my surprise when she texts me asking for the $9 returned so she can have it for her shift??? She’s the owner and works most of the day (mid)! The opener (me) and closer only have 2.5 hour shifts. She gets a majority of the tips anyway because she works the busiest hours. Also I should say there hasn’t been a “last time” like she’s implying. She’s confusing me with someone else I’m pretty sure? This hasn’t happened to me before, and if it did, I’d be fighting to figure out what to do like I am now! This policy that she explains in the last text hasn’t been told to me before. I’ve definitely taken tips after my “shift end” if it was a customer who I helped on the register and made the drink myself. I live in WA state and I thought owners weren’t so supposed to take any tips. I don’t care but she’s trying to take mine so how should I proceed?? I don’t feel like giving it back and I’m considering quitting over this.  

I can’t attach pics of our text but this is how it goes:

Boss:
Hey so I was checking the tips from this morning and it looks like you claimed the tip after 9:30 again. 
*Includes photo of transactions that shows the 9:34 timestamp for tip in question*

Me:
I only included that one because it was that group who I helped and made all the drinks for

Boss:
Like I explained last time. The tips switch over at the next shift. I was making and cleaning up the breakfast sandwiches you had out and unfinished which I started over 10 minutes prior to my shift. I was working during my shift finishing that as well. It doesn't matter what it is you're specifically doing, tips goes to the next on shift at shift change because your shift is over.


I haven’t replied after that because I don’t know what to think but this just doesn’t seem right? I live in Washington State and Google says owners aren’t typically supposed to get tips but I don’t know much. What are my rights here when my scheduled shift ended at 9:30 but I stayed and the last group that tipped me is time stamped for 9:34? Again, there’s no clock in/ clock out that proves I stayed later or has my name attached to that transaction.

Again. 




I was driving along the highway to work. 




Again. 




To my job. 




At the plant factory. 




Ruminating on how sad this world has become. 




We used to grow plants. 




In the wild. 




Now we build them. 




With materials such as lead paint. 




Such as sulfur. 




And such as mulch. 




In the factory, they don't even let me touch the plants.




""Your just a machine supervisor. Just watch the machines in case they start acting up. And stop watering them. Of course, they aren't water dependent. You're just here to fill our humans quota, remember? 




Stop pouring water on the equipment."" 




These are the things my boss, Siri, always tells me. 




And so I watch the machines. 




How can a plant grow without water, I wonder. 




In the factory, the only thing protecting me from the machine debris is a high school football helmet and shoulder pads.




My legs are completely exposed, and during Autumn season, they are shredded by the falling aluminum leaves. 




At least the pay is good - 7 PlantersCoins a month. 




---------------------------------

Funny enough, The Company grows the machines in the same fields we used to grow oranges. 




All my life I wished the tangerine, clementine and orange fields would burn to the ground, taking their sour flavor and nauseating aftertastes with them. 




And now as I drive to work, I find myself reminiscing of the days I hated them. 




And so I drive along this highway as I always do. 




As my Honda Accord sputters, a drunk driver in an 18 wheeler flies by me in the carpool lane. 




As he speeds past, I find myself continuing to watch the driver. 




As if I'm watching him from inside his rearview mirror. 




It's at this moment I remember I lit my Honda Accord on fire six years ago to protest Big Lumbar chopping down the redwoods in Central Park. 




It was two days before easter, and I had forgotten that my trunk was filled with plastic eggs for the hunt I was organizing. 




They said the net effect of the emissions from all the melted plastic was the same as the effect of all the trees being cut down. 




Looks like I did nothing wrong then, I told them. 




------------------------




I remember now I stole this truck from a Wawa parking lot in Tuscaloopha, Montama, the night before. 




The end of another great night with the boys. 




The boys, of course, are my two sons. 




Jepito, Pejito, and Tejipo. 




There's a Poland Spring gallon jug between my legs. 




Filled to the brim with I Can't Believe It's Not Sake. 




I look in the rearview mirror into the truck bed. 




It's my only son - Kiddo Junior. 




His paintbrush jolts with every bump we hit on the highway. 




He's painting a mural on the inside wall on the truck. 




To an outsider, it's another abstract mural bound for the landfill. It's ink thrown against the wall by a male-presenting 11 year old who's never seen the inside of a classroom. 




The circle of life often feels like a straight line, Jepito tells me as he paints. 




I take his comment with a grain of salt. 




He never took geometry. 




In fact, he's never even seen the inside of a classroom. 




As his father, I've always known he was an outdoor cat. 




Trapped inside the body of a boy named Jepito. 




-------------------------------------




I used to love Eggs Benedict. 




I had it every day. 




I even ordered it during lunch meetings with Prime Ministers, fighter jet pilots, and bank tellers from around the world.  




I broke yolk with some of the most powerful people on Earth. 




With my network, we could pass laws, fly wherever we wanted, and withdraw money from whomever's bank accounts we desired. 




Until I betrayed the entree that started it all. Haven't had it in years. 




Eggs. Benedict. Arnold. 




A lover of eggs, now a shell of my old self. 




Working for companies like Shell, Exxon Mobile, and PlantBuilders Corp. 




Companies that build plants that ingest air and release carbon dioxide. 




It's why I named my only son Photosynthesis. 




So people wouldn't forget. 




Until he had an accident as a child laborer in the factory. 




He ate a berry from a mechanical plant. 




Most of his body burned as he laid in agony on the bed of the lava river inside of the plant. 




And when Plantbuilders Corp revived him, he was more machine than man. 




More evil than good. 




I guess the whole reason I'm writing to you, Duke, is to warn you. 




You can be A New Hope. 




Our Duke Skywalker to Photosynthesis' Anakin. 




But Photosynthesis, if your listening, don't forget: you can still become a Miti-Chondrian. 




A powerhouse of the cell. 




And so I drive to work. 




-----------------------------




Recently I decided I'd get up early to watch the sunrise. 




But my phone died in the middle of the night so it never shouted at me to wake up because it was out of power. 




I slept until 7 pm. 




But I wasn't going to miss my sunrise. 




Not today. 




So I tied my feet to a neighbor's balcony and hung upside down watching a sunrise, while the others watched a sunset. 




Life is all about perspective, I guess. 




The last thing I remember is my neighbor, Julian, who was out on the balcony, shouting inside to his wife.




""Christine, why does it smell like feet out on the balcony?""




Then I passed out from the blood rushing to my head. 




----------------------------




And so I drive to work. 




Just a normal guy, earning his paycheck. 




-------------

I pull into a Starbucks on exit 77 to pick up a to-go order as I always do. 




I walk up to the pickup counter. 




Shit. 




No ones ordered anything yet. 




Looks like another breakroom coffee is in my future. 




---------------------------




It's 9 am exactly.




I pull into the parking lot and walk into the factory. 




Just on time, Craig, my supervisor says.




Another day, another PlantersCoin.

I know ghosts don’t exist, at least not in the way some people think. I’ve heard stories about figures lurking in the dark, whispers in the middle of the night, or the touch of invisible hands. These occurrences are real in the sense that the people who lived through them *actually* experienced these events; they saw what they saw, heard what they heard. The cause, however, is anything but supernatural. Rather, a ghost is the manifestation of the murkiest depths of our minds: fears and desires, echoes from the past. They haunt us, indeed, and some people can never escape them. 

Leonard started seeing ghosts only about a year ago. He is not the same man I fell in love with–he forgets our conversations, misplaces his glasses, get lost in our own house, and sometimes can barely form a simple sentence. This could very well explain why he swears that an item was on a different place just seconds before, or why he’s scared of sounds coming from unlikely places. For him, these experiences are real. At first, I tried to explain this was all a product of his imagination, but he’d always get upset. “I’m not crazy”, he would say. “Why won’t you believe me?” I understand his frustration. After all, he’s got no-one else in the world but me. We didn’t have children, even if we tried, and all of his family is now dead or estranged. Nobody else even found out about his decaying mind, falling apart like leaves from a tree. 

Now I choose to believe him. Every day I choose to swiftly misplace his favourite mug, the same he was holding when he hurled that hot coffee onto my face; every day I choose to hide in the wardrobe, the same he used to lock me in, and scrape my nails on the heavy wood. I even started seeing ghosts myself, and I let Leonard know how a shadowy presence was mauling his face in the dead of night; or how the bathroom door got locked by itself and he had to stay there for hours, crying like an infant.

I know ghosts don’t exist, but I make sure to give poor Leonard the reassurance he deserves. It’s the least I could do.",13,1736466299.0,shortscarystories,2,1.0,False

1hxquar,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hxquar/good_news_a_part_of_me_died_today/,Good news! A part of me died today,"I (71F) was raised by an abusive ""mother,"" who shall be known henceforth be known as Jan. She died a few years ago, mostly alone (except for my brother) and definitely unmourned. In fact, we considered throwing a party.

A part of her lives on in me as the voice in the back of my head, telling me I'm a stupid idiot, to get off my lazy ass, that I am useless, and that I am despised, that I can't even kill myself right. You know the one; the one that berates you for any mistake or failure, and the one that denies you any feelings of success by saying it's not good  enough. However well you do, you could have done better.

I have rented a room from a man about my own age for the last 4-1/2 years, who we shall call Jackson. Today, he gave me 60-day notice to move out. It's a complicated situation that has to do with who inherits his house when he dies, which he thinks may be soon. I have to move out on the insistence of the ""friend"" he is leaving it to because her dad came up with a scheme to make the inheritance less complicated for her. This idea doesn't really benefit Jackson at all, it just makes things easier for the ""friend.""

So, I was disappointed, sad, hurt, and angry at the news. I went in my room to process, and thought it was weird that I wasn't overwhelmed and panicked. I am agoraphobic, with a lot of anxiety about certain things, and in the past, overwhelmed and panicked would have been my go-to after what happened. Instead, I sat with my feelings for a bit, and then went right into ""ok, what needs to be done?"" mode. I need to find a place to live, pack my stuff, and move. (I have moved a zillion times in my life, so it's really not a big deal to me.) With a little help from my nieces, piece of cake! Problem solved.

A little later, I went out to the kitchen for a cup of coffee and chatted with Jackson for a few minutes, then took my coffee back to my room. I was thinking, that was different. Shouldn't I be short and cold with him? Shouldn't I be glaring at him and making my displeasure known? Shouldn't I be stomping around and slamming doors, making him feel my wrath? Shouldn't I be giving him the Silent Treatment? Doesn't the situation warrant that kind of behavior? Shouldn't I be making my wrath felt?

Well, no. I wasn't feeling any of those things. I love Jackson like a brother, and I don't feel like treating him that way. I am still disappointed, hurt, sad, and a little angry, but those are my feelings to manage.

Talking with my therapist later, I realized that those feelings that I wasn't having belong to Jan. It was her voice that wanted me to act like that. And I didn't, because *I* didn't want to. 

That part of Jan is dead forever. I am sure that other parts of her are still left in there to torture me, but now I know I can slay the evil monsters, one by one.

I feel lighter, and there is a new space in my chest where there used to be a heavy rock. I can breathe better now. My God, I feel free!

Thanks for reading. This sub is the best!

Akala ko normal lang sa corporate world yung micromanaging policies, until I started working at one of the US in-house banks in BGC…

Gulat kanina yung boss ko na nagpapaalam pa rin ako for bathroom breaks. Turns out I can actually go out anytime and even take my 1 hour lunch whenever I want, as long as matapos ko deliverables at the end of the day. 

Pwede ko rin gamitin phone ko during work, watch netflix or listen to music. And kumain ng heavy rice meal sa desk. Hindi ko na rin kailangan ilagay bag ko sa locker. Pinapatong ko nalang sa desk nang hindi sinisita. 

Lastly, pwede ako dumating saktong start sa shift ko (or a bit later basta magpaalam) without worrying about any trackers. Unlike sa previous work ko, na dapat 15 minutes prior for setting up my laptop and Avaya. 

I thought I had it good kasi sobrang ganda ng naging BPO company ko. I saw myself working 2+ years there…

I was in health insurance and halos wala akong reklamo. Professional lahat ng colleagues ko. Sobrang pro-people ang management. Rewarding din ang work kasi hindi siya repetitive, mentally stimulating, and kaunti lang ang calls. 

Yun nga lang, andun pa rin BPO metrics. Tipong 1 mins ka lang late mag-punch sa Avaya, NTE ka na. Ibabawas pa VLs mo. Bathroom breaks, need ipaalam at ibabawas sa 15mins break mo. Tech issues, kailangan ilagay sa maraming trackers. I’m glued to my desk because of auto-in, and as an athlete, my physique got worse because of its sedimentary nature. Not to mention, nagigisa ako every week sa surveys na di ko naman control.

This was bearable kasi akala ko normal lang micromanagement sa corporate world. Until naging anxious at paranoid akong tao. I was constantly worried about getting fired NOT because of my scorecard. But because of the rules. Kailangan sakto pag-punch ko sa Avaya down to the seconds, nakatago phone ko palagi, at nasa locker yung bag ko. Nagkaroon pa ako ng NTE for having coffee at my desk. 

As someone with attention span issues, dahil dito, nagbunga yung pagiging uneasy ko even outside work. 

But now I’m working as a Data Analyst after working 10 months in the BPO industry, and my mental health has never been better. Lalo na’t hybrid setup pa and I can WFH whenever I please. They even gave me double my previous net salary after I stood firm sa HR with my asking price. 

I hope this inspires people to step out of their comfort zone and seek those back office roles 🙌 lalo na yung mga undergrads diyan tulad ko na akala walang chance sa ganito. 

Kahit ganito lang level of education and work experience ko, nakakasabay pa rin ako sa UP, Ateneo, DLSU, UST grads ng department. If someone like me can escape the call centers, you can do it as well 💪🏿

1hxqqk6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hxqqk6,Baby grand in this room-a mistake?,"We have a sort of open concept living/kitchen area separated by a staircase and guard rail. The front door is on the wall behind the camera to the left (sort of in line with the Christmas tree), and the couch is behind the camera parallel to the coffee table along the wall. The issue is we have quite a wide hallway. Usually I have the secretary desk (to the right of the pic) where the Christmas tree is to sort of section off that big wasted hall space. 

However, I’m considering placing an apartment sized baby grand piano where the tree is now and leaving the desk as is. Technically, it should fit and leave some hall space on either side (to the left and behind, so that we can access the kitchen area). The rail to the left wall measures 62”, leaving room to walk (last pic—pls excuse dusty floor!). The rail itself (perpendicular to coffee table) is not that long, so the piano would certainly extend past it (see second to last pic—I have the tape measure extended to 63”). My question is whether this would seem very awkward and out of place. I’d love to be able to play on an acoustic piano from home, and I’m having trouble finding another place in our relatively small home that would accommodate even an upright. 

We also have a projector that descends above the guard rail (second pic), but usually it’s up.

Read I should try walking around and drinking water and warm herbal tea, coffee. This went on for another hour or two - going back to the toilet, nothing, just painful to push though I could feel the stool trying to exit. Eventually I walked to the drug store and bought a fleet enema (saline)

It was hell trying to use it, took a number of tries, and it burned, but eventually got some of it in (maybe 1/4 of the liquid) after about 5-10 minutes I was able to go, hurt at first to push but eventually i was able to pass a really long hard stool. 

I feel a lot better now, but now my rectum hurts not sure if just all the pushing / enema or if there is more up there.

Huh, big crowd tonight. I thought this run-down shack of a tavern was unpopular enough to drink in peace?

Nothin’ personal, Voko, I like it. It’s cozy, reminds me of the social chambers in my home hive. Nice low ceilings, dim light, sticky floors and the smell of fermented plant matter. Aaah, beautiful.

What do you mean, my fault? Don’t tell me these newbies are here ‘cause they wanna hear me clicking on about Howard.

Oi, paws off the carapace. Settle down and hand me a drink, then we are golden.

Right, just lemme take a sip and we can get into it.

And you, you beaked little shit, I see that coms terminal you are tryin’ to hide behind that goiter. This story better not leave this room, my clutch-mates won’t let me hear the end of it if they find out how useless I was in this whole endeavor! I’m only telling you because none of you lazy bastards are motivated enough to go find out where I’m actually from! Also, I need this shit out of my system, or it’ll haunt my sleep forever.

Come on, tuck it away. Chop chop. Thank you!

Right, where did I leave off? Ah yes, Howard had just made fire. With his bare fuckin’ hands. And the doc tried to provoke what we both thought was a trained warrior or infiltrator of a newly-spacefaring culture by blowing his cover. Damn cats.

For such a skittish race, they sure are reckless when they get inquisitive. Humans also got a sayin’ about that by the way, something about being nosy getting them killed.

Yeah, I learned about six hundred human sayings in the few weeks we were stuck out there, Howard is nothing if not talkative and full of factoids.

Oh, fun fact (heh) about that, unlike yours truly, humans do not actually have perfect recall. Well, most of you don’t without implants, but you guys also aren’t walking data streams.

They store all their experiences in that single wobbly mass of brain matter they carry around atop their lanky-ass forms. No specialized ganglions, no redundancies. One good smack to their domepiece and they lose most of what makes them a person.

Crazy weak spot, that.

Yeah, I know right? How could a species develop powered flight, let alone FTL, if their neural computational capacity is restricted to one single point of failure, a messy-as-fuck piece of tissue that has only some minor specialization?

It’s insane. Maybe it misfiring constantly is where they get their weird-ass ideas about what constitutes “fun”.

Right. So we were sat there, under our tarp, rain prattling away and warming our appendages on the fire – a true blessing for a cold blooded Dictyopteron like myself, even if open flame made me very nervous back then – and Howard was telling us all about how he used be an eagle scout as a juvenile. All the while the diagnostics box was humming away next to the doc, analyzing the dead fish and water samples.

Eagles are some kind of terran bird of prey, yeah don’t ask me what that has to do with making fire and suicidally running around in hostile environments. They don’t build flying machines in that social group from what I could gather. Just roll with it, human naming conventions are weird.

Anyway. He was telling us about how he learned all this stuff, not as some type of traditionalist warrior culture rite, though it apparently had its roots in that, but as a way of entertaining oneself and forming social bonds.

Yes, intentionally seeking danger and hardship for bonding is not unheard of in social non-hivers, but from what I remember it’s mostly a thing for martial castes to increase team cohesion. The apes do it for fun.

When he got to the part where they were building dwellings from frozen water – yeah their planet has a tilted axis, so even safe regions get VERY unsafe temperature fluctuations and weather patterns – I couldn’t believe it. He had to be making that up.

Our doc said as much. She still had her ears laid back, even as she was moving closer to the fire for warmth.

“Mr. Howard, you want me to believe this Earth – do you really call your planet what you also call the dirt? – has many temperate zones and abundant water, and yet your people chose to not only remain in unsafe areas, but even expand to extreme climate zones with intense heat and cold, little water and dangerous wildlife? Voluntarily? For, at best, minor socioeconomic advantage?”

Howard looked slightly abashed as he poked a piece of dried vegetation into the fire, sending up a shower of sparks. I recoiled instinctively, but the doc looked mesmerized as her green, glittering eyes followed the glowing specks up as they drifted out from under the tarp, into the dark, rainy night.

“Um… When you put it like that, it sounds stupid. But you gotta believe me, it’s the truth!” he seemed to suddenly remember something.

“You guys have colonies, right? You know the drive to expand? To explore? Finding new things?”

“Chhh”, the doc made a sound in her throat, “that is true, yes. But you do realize that this expansion is driven mostly by necessity, when resources become scarce?”

She extended a claw as if to indicate it’s evolutionary use.

“We used to be solitary hunters, living in familial clans. Ambush predators. Our social centers evolved around mating and birthing spaces where water and prey were abundant. We gathered there for mating season, and late in the year for birth and to suckle our young. To trade and exchange knowledge, of hunting techniques and unconquered roaming grounds.”

She made a circle in the sand with her paw.

“But once a litter had been born, the young ate their first flesh and the unhealthy had died, the matriarch was obligated to move her clan back to their own hunting grounds.”

She drew lines from the circle to smaller circles surrounding it.

“It ensured genetic diversity. And it followed the rhythm of nature and our prey’s reproductive cycles. Birth and death. The ebb and flow of life. Archeological evidence suggests we only moved those centers in times of great hardship. Droughts that left little prey. Wildfires devastating the land.”

She glanced at the flames as if contemplating their danger. Then scooted closer to them.

“Such migrations always took a great toll on genetic diversity. As a student, I once ran a genetic analysis on myself. Comparing it to the archeological databases, I could actually see the bottleneck where my matriline nearly died out.”

She shivered at almost not having existed. Howard looked at her with wide eyes, apparently lost in thought too.

“And you say your people have an inherent drive to do this? Even when not forced, yes?”

Howard looked uncertain.

“Uhhh… Listen, I’m no historian, so I can’t rightly speak for my whole species and I might be bullshittin’ here ‘cause I didn’t pay much attention in those classes. But from what I remember from school, the first tribal humans did only move when resources ran out, like you guys. But… well, that changed when we learned how to farm. Freed up resources to experiment and develop new tech.”

He yawned.

“That in turn allowed us to prepare better – make shelf stable foods – pemmican, back when we were still hunter-gatherers, then salted meat, grain, hardtack. Stuff you could take with you on a journey. To go somewhere new, find more… uh… stuff. We find that rewarding, finding more stuff. But expeditions require a social structure behind them that allow for their success. Guess we never really lost that urge to move, even when we no longer had to.”

Something seemed to occur to him suddenly.

“Do you guys do farming?”

The doc blinked, amused.

“Yes. Rodents and bigger mammals and fish. But it was difficult and grueling, when our culture started attempting it. See, we are not omnivores, we require a very fatty and protein-heavy diet best served by meat. That meant we never tried to farm plants. It was a terrible process of trial and error, taming livestock, watching it, cultivating it, where those who noticed a lack of herbivore food or an illness diminishing their flock too late were doomed to starvation if they could not find new hunting grounds. Only those clans most observant survived. Or those that took from others by force.”

She looked sad.

“Some still live this way today. Pirate scum.” She hissed.

The human, with a social aptitude I have only seen of the highest ranking diplomats, saw the trajectory this interaction was taking and turned to me, quickly changing the focus.

“What about you, Braxxt? You do any farming?”

“Aye. Fungi, grown deep in our hives. But we sent out the male drones like myself to capture smaller prey too. Sharp claws, see?” I raised my arms.

“But that is not very efficient. The energy it takes to venture out, far, and lie in ambush, is almost always so great that the meat has to be used entirely by the drone, only returning some small scraps to the hive for the larvae.”

My crewmates nodded, understanding.

“So, the majority of our food has always come from the fungal farms. For those, the female drones went out and chewed on inedible plant matter, swallowing it and storing it in a fermentation sack in their thorax. Upon return, they expelled the fermented biomass into the farming chambers, where the fungal spores would settle and grow into bountiful fruit. Some organic farming collectives still do it this way.” I clacked my mandibles, digestive fluid building up in my throat at the thought of a fresh fungal stir fry.

“Ewww.” Howard said, amused. The doc wrinkled her snout.

“These fungal strains, even today, are guarded like martial caste hive secrets. The exquisite taste of Sklaxian aspergillus novofumigatus – a type of fungus with heat resistant spores that is only found on dead matter after a fire – is so prized, that I heard once, a remote colony paid for a gene-stabilized pack of spore seedings with an entire freighter of raw lithium!”

“Hah, kinda like truffels.” Howard said.

“What is that, a truffel?” both myself and the doc asked.

“A fat, knobby fungus some pretentious dickheads grate and sprinkle on their noodles. Only tried it once, wasn’t for me. It can not be farmed, really, but has to be found in the wild when foraging.”

“Hold on.” I interrupted. “You still have a forager caste? Forced to endure hardship to acquire a luxury item? That seems cruel!”

“Ha, it’s not a caste, really, just a job. A way to contribute to society. Like piloting a transport. Or engineering.”

With that, he smirked at the doc and added:

“Or, you know, “menial labor”.”

She did her best impression of a statue and looked away at that jab; eyes narrowed. But some mirth could be seen in the way her lip curled on one side and revealed a sharp fang. Either that, or she contemplated tackling him and ripping his throat out, but I chose to believe it was not the latter.

A quiet beep drew our attention to the med scanner. It had run the full analysis on the tissue and “blood” samples the doc fed it.

Apparently glad of the distraction, our medical feline bent over and retrieved the device. She scrolled through the results on the small screen. Looking over her shoulder, I could see a lot of green, which I assumed was good, but three major red notes.

“What’s that mean?” Howard asked, as he pointed one of his small arm-tentacles at the screen and poked at the red entries.

The doc hissed and slapped his hand away, but left her claws retracted – she was clearly not actually mad at him.

“Don’t touch that, I’m reading!” she fiddled with the system some more and scrolled through a long log of data.

Her face, like most of the time when she was not angry, was unreadable. Howard was fidgeting.

It seemed he was nervous and could also not interpret her expression, which strangely made me feel much better about my inability to read emotional cues in mammals.

Gradually, I could see the tense muscles in her shoulders relax. That was good. Wasn’t it? Or was it a defeated slump?

Now I was getting twitchy! Mites eat me, but waiting for the results was scarier than the ship exploding!

Finally, she spoke.

“It seems your theory was correct, Mr. Howard. The system could indeed be tricked into running a full analysis on your water and tissue samples. That first red alert was it indicating there was no actual blood cells to be found in the “blood”, as is to be expected from drinking water. The tox scans came back clean, only some microbial life forms are present, which would be the second red alert.”

“NICE!” Howard pumped his fist in the air in a gesture that seemed rather extravagant for such a small thing as having drinking water, yet in that moment I too felt like celebrating. My abdomen involuntarily began to sway in the first movements of the tremble dance.

What that is? We use it to communicate non-verbally. Instinctive movement, basically. Indicates the workers should stop gathering and help me carry the surplus foraged matter inside. It’s connected to abundance and now mainly used in formal celebrations.

Sorry, I’m stalling, it’s about to get weird.

Hand me another drink, will you? Thanks!

Howard spoke again.

“So… we should be able to just boil the water to kill the germs, and then we can drink it safely, right? What’s the last alert?”

“Yes. And… that last one… it is more complicated, yes? This alert relates to the meat of the fish. I sampled muscle meat and all organs, including the neural structures. It has some minor parasites that heat will kill. It is apparently not toxic in and of itself – if you avoid the filtration organs, that is, these have accumulated some heavy metals.”

“Alright, so just eat the filet, sounds simple enough. What’s the problem?”

“It’s this line here, see? Apparently, there is an unknown compound present in the meat which I can’t fully analyze without a complete lab suite including a gas chromatography and mass spectrometry system.”

She scrolled some more until a structural diagram and a spectrogram popped up.

“IR spectrometry indicates it could be an alkaloid, looking at the preliminary structural analysis. Might be harmless, might kill you. No idea.”

I remembered my early years in the hive, helping out in the farms. Some fungi produce alkaloids that can be inactivated when heated or treated with a mild acid. I looked at the flames before me.

“Is it thermostable?” I asked.

“Again, no idea. This thing is not a pocket chemistry lab. It’s just a simple spectrometer with a federation scientific database plugged in against which it checks readings and gives you the closest matches. It’s called paw-printing – each signature is unique, but you need to know what it belongs to, to identify it.”

Howard leaned forward and looked at the screen, the skin above his face getting very wrinkly.

He asked: “Can you pull a specific chemical from the database for me? I think I know what this may be.”

The doc looked incredulous.

“Sure.""

She tapped a few buttons.

“But, for the love of the matriarch, do NOT tell me an untrained hab-dweller that just happens to have survival training to rival our expeditionary forces also just so happens to know organic chemistry well enough to infer the potential toxicity and effects of an unknown alkaloid from the approximated structural formula.”

Howard laughed.

“Nah, my sister’s just a massive nerd and used to wear a shirt with a very similar structure on it. Does this thing speak English?”

He leaned over and took the small box from the doc. She suppressed a hiss and moved closer to the human to help him navigate the menus.

“Here. Enter your search term in this field. Like so. This is not a sophisticated system but the support has not been discontinued, at least. It should have downloaded an update when we left the station, so I assume it has Earth data too. Chrr… somewhere. Maybe.”

Howard tapped on the screen and cycled through virtual keyboards until lettering came up I recognized from his name tag. He started typing.

“Mh, nothing. You sure this thing has Earth data?”

The doc looked a bit more closely.

“Oh yes, I see the issue. It’s not integrated to the fed system. You’ll need to go to the data browser, like so.”

She tapped some more on the screen and a new search window popped up, then she handed the system back to Howard.

When he was done, a structural formula and a short chemical formula in human lettering appeared: C8H10N4O2.

“How do I…?” the human began, then tapped something by accident and closed the window.

“Oh fucking…” he grumbled and started to randomly press buttons. The doc flicked her ears in annoyance and took the small box back. Forcefully.

Two taps with her claws later and the window the human had closed was back.

“What is it you wanted to do, Mr. Howard? It might save us all a lot of time and conserve energy if you guide me through your thought process, yes?”

“Ah geez. Sorry. I’m not used to all this high-tech stuff. I wanted to see if I could make it compare what I pulled up to what you found in the fish.”

The doc sniffed and said: “This piece of junk is a lot of things, but not high technology, Mr. Howard.”

Then she nodded and prodded the screen some more, until a green info screen popped up. It read: “highly probable match, equivalent binding activity and stability expected”.

She slowly looked between the screen and Howard. Twice.

She took a long breath, swallowing an incredulous exclamation, then only asked, with a strained calm in her voice, “What, precisely, do you think I am looking at?”

“Well, I thought this structure looked very familiar. I think it might be caffeine. Because it looked like it? So… it should behave like caffeine? Or at least… act like it when consumed?”

“Mr. Howard, first of all, things looking like other things is not a scientific way to analyze quite literally ANYTHING. Second, what, by my ancestor’s bones, is this caffeine substance?”

“You could just read the database entry…?”

 “I’m not a reading a two-hundred-page data manifest, in your squiggly, prattling language, on the same day 80 percent of my crewmates died, my ship exploded and I got stranded on a death world moon with the two crewmembers I know least about. Just… please just tell me. I’m done.”

Howard looked down, pink-faced, then reached a calming hand-paw out to gently touch her furry back. She bristled, then settled down.

“Sorry. That was insensitive. I try to shut out the trauma, gotta stay functional for now. I’ll probably cry myself to sleep later, though, if that makes you feel better?”

She hissed, but also looked slightly amused. “It does not. But I appreciate the thought. So, what am I looking at?”

“Okay. So… caffeine… as you said, it’s an alkaloid. Some plants on Earth produce it to kill insects.” That made me raise my claws.

“Ah! It is poisonous!” I clacked my mandibles nervously and scooted back from the offending carcass.

“Well, yeah, for some insects. For humans, too, in extremely high doses, like most substances, you know. Makes our heart race, caffeine overdose really fucking sucks. Trust me, I know from experience.”

I raised a questioning claw.

“How do you know that? I thought you knew how to survive the wild? Avoid poisonous plants? Or did you have to consume it under threat of starvation?”

Howard laughed.

“Hell no. Just had like two huge pots of coffee and 3 energy drinks back-to-back when I studied for finals. Thought I was gonna die! My head was spinning, I puked and had the shakes. My heart felt like it was exploding. Suffice to say, I did not get any studying done past midnight. But it was a learning experience anyway!”

He laughed.

We looked at him with newfound disrespect.

“You intentionally consumed a lethal poison? To study?!” the doc exclaimed. “Who provides these poisons to juveniles? Are there such vile, criminal elements in your home habitat?”

“Uhh… that’s not… well technically… how do I explain this? Caffeine, for us, is usually a very nice uh… drug. It’s a stimulant, basically. Makes you alert, helps you suppress the need to sleep or eat, at least for a while. And usually it’s very hard to overdose anywhere near lethal amounts, if you are not a stupid teenager that thinks he can just take more so it’s more effective. It’s freely available anywhere, though it is a little addictive and withdrawal gives you severe headaches.”

“You are aware that you are not making it sound any safer, yes? This is basically like the combat drugs our elite troops consume on long missions!”

Howard looked very sheepish.

“I’m an idiot, okay? Don’t judge my whole species by my actions, please! But what I really want to know is the dose. How much of this practically-caffeine is in the meat?”

The doc fiddled with her scanner again.

“Chrrr… About 10 milligrams per 500 grams, at least in the muscle. The filtration organs contain a higher amount. Might be the fish is not producing it by itself but consuming a plant that contains it.”

“Ha, nice, that’s just like having a small cup o’ joe with your filet o’ fish! I say we fry this bugger up and try it. Doc, you should only take a small bite and wait a while to see if it affects you if you never had caffeine before. And you… Well, maybe you should not even do that, Braxxt.” He looked at me apologetically.

“I do very obviously not intend to consume poison specifically evolved to murder my entire genetic clade.” I deadpanned.

Howard laughed again and slapped my carapace hard enough to make it reverberate all the way to my mandibles. I clacked them to get rid of the tingly feeling and listened to the prattling rain and chirping, screeching fauna. It was strangely calming.

“Dude, you crack me up. But seriously. We oughta eat and get some rest; I have no idea how long the nights here even are. Tomorrow, I’ll show you guys the spring I found and we can explore some more together. Sound good?”

We agreed and watched the human cut up and prepare the slightly-gnawed-on fish by fileting and piercing it with small branches and setting them up close to the fire.

We sat in silence for a while, as Howard kept stoking the fire and turning the fish-meat on his sticks until he was satisfied they were safe to eat, parasite-wise.

With that, he sat back down and handed the doc a stick with crispy bits of fish on them and took one for himself. As the furless omnivore and the very furry predator ripped chunks of meat off the stick, I chewed on the carbohydrate ration bar allocated to me.

It tasted rather bland. I missed the spicy fungal chips I had in my luggage back on the ship. Ugh.

“Mh, tashtesh like fatty, stringy tofu!” Howard mumbled around a mouthful of steaming hot fish meat.

The doc very carefully chewed a small bite of the meat, then put it down for a while.

She leaned back, eyes closed.

I was concerned, and watched her face very carefully. It took a few minutes, but I could see the subtle changes the drug forced on her nervous system.

Her eyes, until then often drifting open and closed, sliding across the fire, unfocused and deep in thought, started moving around more after a few minutes. Her droopy ears perked back up and she sat up straighter, breathing deep.

Howard must also have picked up on the change as he gently put a hand on her paw.

“You good?”

“I think I feel it!” she exclaimed, sounding both worried and exhilarated.

“Mh, might be placebo, since you expect an effect. You sure?”

She almost snapped at him then, I think, but reigned herself in. Breathed. Then fixed his eyes with hers.

“Absolutely sure. My pulse has quickened beyond what a normal fear response would be. My mind is restless, unlike anything I have felt before. Yet focused.”

“Eh, could be the adrenaline.”

“The what?” we both asked.

“Wait. You guys don’t have adrenaline? Or do you call it something else?”

The doc gave him a look.

“If we called it something else and the translator did not have it in its database, Mr. Howard, how would we know what you are talking about? We need some context, yes?”

“Oh. Uh… that’s on me. Sorry, I’m pretty knackered. Uhhh… Okay..”

He ripped another piece of fish meat off the stick with his teeth and chewed.

“Us humans, we got these glands in our bodies, right, and in emergency situations, when we get startled or scared or feel threatened, they pump out this hormone. Adrenaline. It affects the sympathetic nervous system. Numbs the pain response, raises the heart rate and makes us more alert. Things seem to slow down if it is a really hefty dose. We use an artificial version of it to restart the heart of a dying person.”

I listened closely, this seemed like classified information he definitely would not be sharing if he was a trained soldier. Having a gland for combat drugs, built into your body. How strange!

“There have been documented instances where a person was seriously injured, even lost a limb, but kept going.”

“What do you mean, kept going?” I asked, highly curious.

Loss of limbs used to be a pretty common occurrence for my species, but we also have eight of them and can deal with a loss pretty easily. Just have to clamp down the cut to keep the ichor in.

Having only four limbs and using two for locomotion, that was different. Losing one seemed much more catastrophic.  

“What’s a good example… mhm… there was this guy, a soldier, right? He was attacking an enemy position, uphill, fortified to hell and back.”

I clacked my mandibles in respect. Being in the vanguard against a fortified position is considered a great honor and often means you die for the hive, bringing greatness to your clutch.

“So, he charged up there with his men, right? The fighting was intense, the enemy had a machine gun, just firing wildly at the charging soldiers, and BOOM, an explosive took off his left arm. But he didn’t go down, instead he dropped his rifle, couldn’t use it one handed, you see, and drew his sabre.”

The doc gave him a quizzical look.

“It’s like… a melee weapon. Sharp and pointy.”

He picked up the tool he used to cut up the fish.

“Like a very big knife.”

“He assaulted an entrenched force that was using ballistics? Wounded? WITH A KNIFE?” The doc sounded incredulous.

“A BIG knife.” Howard corrected.

“No wonder you know the story of his death, that’s insane!”

“Oh, he did not die in the charge. He got shot a few times, but that didn’t stop the guy. Made it to the top, took out the gunner and captured the position. Even managed to give some orders to his men before he died.”

“…remind me to never anger you, Mr. Howard.” The doc all but whispered.

“Oh, we aren’t all built like that, ma’am. It IS a special story, which is why we still tell it, centuries later. But many people that were heavily wounded or in extreme distress report that the adrenaline gave them immense strength, speed and endurance.”

He seemed to think of a better explanation.

“There are, for example, also stories of mothers that could lift hundreds of kilos of weight to free their trapped children. I also remember an old movie about some guy that got mauled by a bear – big apex predator, like 5 times my weight and size, all sharp fangs and claws – and managed to walk home. That might be apocryphal, though.”

He finished his meat and apparently tried to read our stunned expressions with little success.

“Point is, that’s what adrenaline does. You guys haven’t got any endocrine systems like that?”

“No” came the reply from myself and “Not as such” from the doc.

The doc flicked her ears thoughtfully.

“We have fear responses, of course, and our alertness is raised when we sense a threat. But the reaction is nothing like this! I can see how such a thing would be an evolutionary advantage. Your planet must indeed be an incredibly hostile place, if it takes shrugging off lethal injury to outcompete other species.”

She tapped a claw against the sand thoughtfully.

“Maybe it is the combination of close cooperation in your social structures and the high impact an individual sacrifice can have that makes suicidally stupid actions a viable strategy?”

Howard seemed to think about that, hard, as the doc went on:

“We do have reflexes and instincts that allow us to react without thought, and we can feel tense and afraid – but we will usually falter within seconds when mortally wounded! If we mess up that badly, it is best to be removed from the clan.”

We kept discussing evolution and survival for a while as the doc slowly finished her food, to stretch the poison out and not be overwhelmed, but all the talk about death made us gloomy and, together with the exhausting day, we gradually settled down as the rain pattered on and I slowly drifted off to sleep while the rain splashed on and on, the waves lapped against the sand and the jungle played it’s melody of screams and clicks and rustling.

The next thing I remember is waking to a shower of sparks, as Howard tossed some wood on the fire. I did not stir from my crouching position, trying to fall asleep again, so he might not have noticed I was even awake.

He walked around the fire and was squatting down behind the doc, who had curled up and was shifting restlessly, putting a calming hand on her shoulder. She stirred again, blinked, and looked back at him.

“…shouldn’t have eaten that damn drug fish…” she grumbled. “…can’t sleep… keep thinking… about getting my legs ripped off…”

She pressed her head against his arm, seemingly only half awake.

“Don’t think it’s the fish, doc. You’re wired and mentally exhausted is all. Need to process what happened. When I couldn’t sleep as a kid, it helped to just talk a little. Calms me down right quick.”

“Is that why you never shut up? To stay calm?” came the snarky response from below him.

He shook his head, smiling.

“Maybe, but my dad always used to say it’s a good thing I don’t like hunting, because my yapping would scare away any quarry.”

“Indeed, it would! My clan would have cast you out for sabotaging the hunt within minutes!”

“Heh, probably. Come on, let’s make it a game. I ask you a question, you answer, then it’s your turn. Sound good?”

“Mhh. Why not.” She stretched, then curled back up. “At least it’ll pass the time. Ask away!”

“Right. Earlier, you said you weren’t an actual doctor. What did you mean by that?”

“What I said. I’m a medical technician. I received paramedic training and am skilled in using the automated med suites like you find in ships and habitats, but I’m not authorized to operate on a patient alone.”

“But… people keep calling you doc? Why don’t you say anything? Or have them use your name?”

“Hey, it’s my turn! Adhere to the rules you have laid out, Mr. Howard, or face the consequences.” She snarled playfully, poking his bare chest with an extended claw.

“Damn, okay. Chill! Heh. What’s your question?”

“I would very much like to know if you have a clan back home. You mentioned a nephew – the offspring of your sibling, correct?”

“Indeed. My parents are no longer with us, sadly. Dad died early, work accident. Mom two years ago. My sister moved to Frisco for work. Biotech. So, I only see her when I take the kid out to the Appalachians for the summer. And that’s already it. Got some cousins out west, but we don’t talk much.”

“That is a very small clan, Mr. Howard. Do you not have a partner of your own?”

“Ha, now YOU are asking two questions. But I guess turnabout is fair play. Yeah, I’m alone. Mostly. A guy that works odd jobs and hangs out in the woods for most of his free time isn’t much of a desirable partner in our culture.”

He looked down, his face wrinkly again. Then smiled.

“Less baggage also meant I could take this job, though! I’m on an alien planet! How fucking cool is that!?”

“I see. A satisfactory reply. So let me answer your previous question. I enjoy being called doc. It is technically what I do, even if I did not complete the full formal training. It is what makes me useful. And you will have noticed my name tag only says “med tech”, yes?”

Both Howard and I glanced at her crumpled uniform on the sand next to her. Indeed, it only had her job title.

“That is intentional. I have a very large clan. It is customary to only carry your matrilineal name and a number until you have distinguished yourself enough to earn a name that is worthy of your own line. I myself would currently be Flamna Vren by this convention, which I distaste.”

Howard looked very confused, and I must admit, I felt uncertain too. The catfolk are secretive at the best of times, and this very personal look into their social structure was unheard of.

“It literally means “great huntress twenty”. Come on, don’t try to be polite about it, it’s stupid.”

Howard’s cheek was twitching and I suppressed a very amused clack of my mandibles to avoid letting them know I was listening.

“Well, I can call you kitty instead, if you like.” The human said, with mirth evident in his inflection, if not on his face.

“You used that expression before, what does it mean?”

“It is a pet name, for a cat. A small predator we enjoy having around as a domestic animal, for company, which you very much resemble. Well, the big pointy ears are more like a jackal’s and your fur looks like an ocelot’s and you are taller than me and could probably bite my head off, but I think you’d make a good cat.”

He patted her head and she bared her teeth.

“I am most decidedly not a house pet, Mr. Howard. If you use that name or gesture again, you shall lose this insult-prone tongue of yours!”

She sounded dead serious.

At that, the human stumbled back from his squatting position and raised his hands defensively.

“Oh boy. Sorry, meant no offense, just wanted to bring some friendly banter.”

“Oh no…” Vren- uh- the doc groaned. “you’re one of THOSE cultures…”

“Those?”

“Where playfully insulting your closest allies is considered a friendly gesture.”

He smirked at her again.

“Not everywhere, that’s more of a specialty of my peer group. Rough, uneducated, menial laborers, you know.”

She sniffed, then relaxed.

“Heh, point taken.”

She breathed in and out calmly.

“You were right, I do feel better. And very tired. We should rest, while this damn jungle is quiet enough for it.”

Howard tensed up and glanced around. I was alarmed too. The noises had stopped.

“You’re right. It IS quiet. Very quiet. Fuck!”

Suddenly he jumped upright, took a burning piece of vegetation by the unburnt part and moved outside the warm glow of the fire, into the rain that was slowly stopping. He held the flame outstretched behind himself so it did not impact his night vision as he scanned the tree line.

The doc kicked me very lightly to wake me up. I moved a claw to indicate I was awake. Then we followed his shadowed form from where we lay, straining to see in the dark past the bright fire.

No sound except intermittent dripping was audible from the vegetation. Pale yellow light glistened on the droplets that hung from leaves and vines and branches and bushes, some from the gas giant shining through the clouds above, some from the firelight.

Nothing moved.

Howard took a step forward and moved the burning branch left and right.

Nothing, again. Not a sound other than dripping, and no motion.

Then three of the glistening droplets blinked simultaneously and a branch a good four meters up moved.

Whew, okay, took longer than expected, telling that part – but I needed you guys to know what my two fellow survivors are like, as persons. Because what happened next was the actually harrowing part and you’ll buy me wayyy more drinks if you actually want to know how this went.

3. I will never speak to her again and don’t want to be around her or let my kids around her I told my brother this before he told her about the trip and he invited her anyways.

     Anyway just wanted to make a few things clear before I dove into the story. I absolutely hate my mother and some of you will probably say “That’s your family you shouldn’t hate family…” and I’m just gonna flat out tell ya, you’re wrong. Some family members can and should rot in a ditch, not saying my mom should but maybe she should forever stub her toe on a coffee table to make me giggle. 
     Anyway my brother was initially supposed to come visit me in the state I moved to, it’s only a couple hour drive away. And tbh it was like pulling teeth to get anyone of my family members to visit when I lived 25 minutes away so I kind of expected him to cancel having to drive several hours, and instead of the original idea of my brother coming to visit in his own trip with his family to come see me and my sister had her own date set to come see me he upended it all and decided a family trip to a mutual distance location would be easier for him and everyone else…I don’t see how when my sisters visit was a private convo between her and I and now she’s not gonna come to that because my brother took it upon himself to change the plans.
    I get wanting to go somewhere familiar and somewhere everyone would go but I set up these dates separately with each of them because I hate family reunions. Im always left out and feel like an outsider when around everyone else. It’s hard to make conversation when everyone’s talking over you, it’s always been like this. So it would’ve been nice that he consulted me before making solid plans and convincing everyone to go with what he wanted.
   Now here’s where my mom comes in, I’m used to rolling over and giving in when things change. I’ve had to roll with the punches my entire life and when you’ve been punched at as much as I have you become practically liquid. You just give in and do what makes s*** happen. 
    So I told my brother fine I’ll talk to my husband and we’ll see what we can do with my husbands work schedule. 
    I had every intention of making it work until I asked him(bro) if our mother was going and he gave me a half a**ed answer of “ya know I don’t think they are, I doubt they can afford it right now. But I don’t have any control over it if they go.” And in my head I’m like what the hell do you mean you don’t have control, you planned this the only reason they would be going is if you invite them…and if they can’t afford it why tell them about it at all. So then I told him, “Look I know y’all are cool with ma, but I’m not I don’t want to be around her I don’t want my kids around her. She would very much be a reason I don’t attend.” I made myself very clear that if she goes I will not. And mind you this was supposed to just be a sibling gathering.
   So a few days pass and I’m like okay let’s plan this ish, my brother sent me the name of the hotel he was staying at ect. And after the third day of our initial convo he called me again and I asked for a second time if our mother was going just to be sure and he told me…
    ”Yeah she and dad are gonna be there. You have to understand don’t make this about them this is about us and the siblings getting together don’t let her being there hold you back or keep you from going.” And I dunno but I kinda just got real pissed off because I told him the one reason I wouldn’t go would be because of her. I don’t care what any of y’all try to say to guilt me into going I’m not gonna go if she’s there. So I tell him something halfa**ed and say.
    “I told you I wouldn’t go if she’s there, I dunno if I’m gonna go, but I’ll think about it and try and set my feelings aside.” Meanwhile in my head I’m thinking I’m definitely not going, I’m not setting my feelings aside this time I told you my reasons and you did it anyway. I also asked if my parents got their own hotel room cause he told me they can’t afford it so I’m wondering if they scrounged the money up and he told me he was letting them stay in his hotel room. Like not only did you invite them, but you gave them lodging…he really must’ve not wanted me there all so he could bring his portable baby sitter aka our mother. I get it he has like 4 kids so it’s hard, but my other brother has 3 kids and they don’t bring a baby sitter, I have 2 kids and don’t need a sitter. They have always needed her to watch their kids from the 1st child and onward.
    So it’s been a few more days and I’ve decided im not going. I told my sister I’m not going. And she can inform them but I’m done being walked over and setting my feelings aside. Since I was a kid I have always been the bigger person, always set my feelings aside to accommodate my siblings, my parents l, my friends. I’m done. So AITA for deciding not to go.

Im on 300 mg XL and in general just pretty bad at checking in with myself so besides the dry mouth side effect I dont really know if its doing anything for me? If that makes sense.

I got on it to quit vaping a year and a half-ish ago but found that it helped me with mood and impulses. Also before taking this, caffeine didnt really work for me in terms of as an energy booster, but now it does. For example, before I could drink a few cups a day and be able to sleep fine/not really tell a difference in me with caffeine vs without caffeine. But now i drink an energy drink and i do feel the energy and finally understand why people need coffee to start their day lol. 

Anyway, I feel normal on it in terms of energy and really only feel the difference when I have caffeine, when previously it did not affect me as much. But like I said, maybe its just a subtle difference in energy so I dont notice? Anyway, please let me know what your experience is with the “energy boost” aspect of being on this drug.

I (f42) have been single for 3 years. It was a choice I made after getting out of a very toxic and asconautic relationship of almost 9 years. I decided to get to know myself and heal myself, going through psych and therapy to find out how to become a better person, as I know that when you're in an actual narcissistic relationship, you gain some narcissistic qualities, and I wanted to be able to nip that in the rear right away. I found myself and have become an almost completely different person, though I am still in extensive trauma therapy. Since becoming single, I've made a lot of new online friends and am a part of a community that \*shares partners. I lost 70lbs in 8 months, got into the gym and have turned my health almost completely around. I can handle my life and my own mental health fairly well, letting people know when I need a moment to process their words or when I need a day to myself. My trauma therapy is even going to start me on another round of EMDR to help get rid of whatever diagnosis he believes I have going on, and my psych doctor is weaning me off a lot of medication that she doesn't believe I need to be on anymore. It's refreshing!



However, being a person who dates more than \*one person at a time is a bit more difficult in the dating field than it is for monogamous people. I recently got on Facebook dating and by chance met a really great guy, Ryan - fake name - (M41). He's burly and bearded, sweet, attentive, and compliments me all the time. We have a lot of different interests, some that neither of us has a real interest in becoming engrossed in and while some may think that makes us doomed (ha), I find it healthy. We can do our own things separately while we do share common interests in other areas and can make use of our time together better. He's also been in the same dating world I have been, simply in a slightly different way. He's cultured and handsome and tells me I'm a badass and cute every day. We had also agreed to keep our relationship 'ours' only for the foreseeable future. We decided mutually after a month to become bf and gf and things were beautiful for roughly 2 weeks. 



\-Long suffering sigh-



The biggest issues that I have with this man are that **A:** He lives with his not quite ex-wife, Emily - fake name - (f38?) who has the entire upstairs to herself, while they share the main floor, and they have 2 young ones (M2 & M7) that run around, as well as a teen (f16) that is his daughter alone. **B:** While Ryan is Mr. Mom, his ex-partner is barely able to take care of herself with her own mental health issues, let alone her children for more than a couple hours at a time. I feel that Ryan lets her take advantage of him in more ways than one, however I didn't voice this because we are still so new in the relationship. \*\*Hindsight being what it is, I can recognize that perhaps she has a post-partum thing going on as well, considering they were breaking their marriage up when the youngest was only a little over a year old and he had told me they'd been falling apart for years\*\*

  
Emily and Ryan have been separated since Nov of '23, living in the same home and trying to cohabitate for the kids. While I am not particularly patient with every child I come across, I get attached very quickly and am very good with them. His children grew on me quickly. Emily and I had even tried becoming friends. We went out and had a few drinks, talked a lot and got to know each other quite well, I thought. Emily had been in a year long relationship with someone else and that day he had broken up with her. She had voiced that she was having a very hard time with me being with her ex. Whereas Ryan had reassured me that he doesn't have romantic feelings for his ex. I'd been told that things were mutually fine between Ryan and Emily until I came into the picture.



She kept to herself for about 2 weeks after that until 3 days ago when she admitted to Ryan that she still has feelings for him. A month ago, he would surprise me with a coffee that I like, randomly invite me over or out on a date, or even invite himself over. I always let him take the lead on when we spent time together because he did have children to juggle, and I have my own business that is flexible enough to find time whenever he had it. Since Emily's confession, Ryan has been distant with me. Much less messaging, much less trying to spend time with me. I spent that time jittery and worried to death but scared to push him into telling me what's going on. He finally told me he was coming over (night before last) and by that evening, he told me Emily was having a breakdown, and he was watching over her to make sure she didn't do anything to herself that everyone would regret. I advised him to call the rescue and let them handle it - knowing the night between us was already a no go - but he came back with *""I don't know if I want to do that, and it wouldn't change me not coming to see you anyway""*. I said, *""Obviously, but she needs professional help if she's being serious""*. After more conversation, I came to the conclusion that she's being manipulative, and he felt the same way but he was unwilling to change the situation. That gave me a lot of clarity. Yesterday morning, I finally worked up the nerve to say something. I asked him if we were in trouble and his answer took a long time coming. Those little bubbles in the chat that appear and disappear were making me nauseas. His message read: *""I don't know, I'm confused""*. 

  
I always told myself that I would not be the other woman, and this relationship just got extremely messy, so I told Ryan that I was backing away for a day or so to give us both some time to process what we want out of this. It was very rough for me because this brought up old feelings of abandonment and betrayal as Emily had always been so openly happy to my face and Ryan went from *""I have such deep feelings for you so fast""* to *""I'm confused and don't know what I want""*.  With a lot of continued conversation (never fighting, we didn't argue about it at all), he thanked me for giving us some time to maturely process this change, told me I'm a badass, and we stopped communication. 

  
My friend (f32) had to make a bet with me because I kept wanting to break my own self-made boundary and message Ryan. She told me that as long as I don't message Ryan, she won't go buy a nicotine vape. Ya'll, that's huge so of course I took the bet. After 24 hours of going through a roller coaster of emotions, from anxiety to ugly crying, I finally got my head on straight and decided to break it off with him. I let him know I would be here for him as a friend and since he has his own mental health concerns, I assured him that I would check in to be sure he was okay. I also stated *""as a friend, please continue to look out for your boundaries. Look out for manipulation and control""*. We had openly communicated about all of those things throughout our small relationship, so I did feel comfortable telling him that, to which he wholeheartedly agreed he would do and told me he would love to remain friends. 

It hurts so much to know that within my grasp, I had some hope and now it's been yanked out from under me, but I feel like an asconaut. Should I have fought harder? My two closest friends tell me I did the right thing. Others congratulate me for being so strong, though I feel so weak. Some people say I should have fought for him because he was now in a relationship with me, and I should've let him know how much he meant to me. I've always been the type of woman who seals off the emotions after the breakup. Living with the mindset of ""If you don't want me then you don't deserve me"" my whole life has basically made me a permanent ascon 3.  I feel as if this was the right road to go down but still, I have to ask:

I basically have to turn my heat all the way down or off when I’m driving, or open my windows every ten minutes to release the moisture. Of course this introduces a ton of freezing air into the car too, and isn’t a solution. 

The fogging up happens even when it’s a dry day and I haven’t tracked snow into the car, and there are no open coffee cups or water bottles or anything inside. I’ve tried the kitty litter solution and it hasn’t worked at all. Also, the air recirculation button is off. 

What could be causing this? It’s the first winter since 2012 that it’s happened, so I’m guessing something has gone wrong. The only recent work I’ve had is a new o2 sensor and a new fuse box, due to a recall. Maybe this is a dumb question but is this something mechanics look at, even though it might not be mechanical?

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I need some help for my mental health.,"'ve known this girl for about a year now. She is from Israel and is 21 years old. I am from the U.S and 24 years old. We met at college. She is studying to be a vetenarian, while I'm trying to be a surgeon. It started in organic chemistry lab. I was alone and needed a partner, so did she and we became partners for the semester. The first day of meeting her was very cordial, with asking each other where we were from and what we were studying. The next couple of weeks went by and everything was going smoothly. I happened to ask where she sat in the lecture portion of the class and she responded with I sit alone near the middle and come sit with enthusiasm. Over the next couple of weeks she then would invite me to study in the library especially on the days we had lab together. During the studying we never really studied together because both of our study techniques are very different, but she always insisted of going to the library. We always used to sit right next to each other than across the table. Right around the time of when Iran attacked Israel with the ICBM attack in 2024 she became very different. Some days she would show up late to class and not even sit by me. The biggest switch was we had went to the library and as I pulled the chair out from right beside her, she snapped at me and said why do I feel the need always sit right next to her. To my response I was caught off-guard and said I don't know and from then on out I never sat right next to her. Also, during that semester there was no tables available in the library so we had chosen a booth area to study for the time being. We were both in the process of scheduling classes together and she had adjusted her own schedule just to have the same lab time as me for Organic chemistry 2. During the process we didn't really study much and we got on the topic about how her older brother is dating an older woman and she had made an odd comment about how if she was a year older she would be more comfortable. I was very confused and didn't say anything in response. As the class went on for about the final 4 weeks she continued to be moody and not like her usual self. Some days she would be talkative asking me questions to not really saying hello. But all in all she still sat by me and insisted about studying in the library together.

So, now class has ended, and summer has begun. Throughout the whole summer she never texted once. I figured she would text if she wanted to, so I never gave her one text throughout the whole 3 months of summer. A day before class starts she asks how was summer and If I was still in Organic chemistry 2 together and what time my lab portion was also. This is confusing to me because why would she ask me about the time when she sat there right with me and made her schedule? Anyways I responded and told her when it was and she said cool I'll see you then. I sat near the back but I was kind of hurt a bit since she never even texted me throughout the whole summer so I played quiet and waited if she would make a bit of an effort. Which she did the first day. I saw her wander the aisles aimlessly looking for me until we made eye contact and she then sat right next me. Again she asked If I was going to the library to study and of course I said yes and then she followed. The first couple of weeks were pretty good. She then asked me in vague question with was I studying for the test late after lab one day and I responded what do you want to do? and she responded with to study for the test on a certain date and I obliged. After lab this semester I had been giving her a ride home. During the car ride she would sit pretty close to me. She also started to communicate that her friends and roommates were bad influences by encouraging her to smoke marijuana and they were also loud. Which was preventing her from studying efficiently.  During a short three day break I had got the courage and asked her out to lunch hoping for a date, but she stated over text as friends which I never even pursued the lunch thing after that. We then got to class that week together and she wasn't awkward at all, but I was pretty quiet. To be honest I was really hurt and didn't want to be mean to her but for a good couple of weeks I didn't study at all with her at the library and just left without saying. Now after this there was weird moody relationship between the two of us for the rest of the semester. Somedays she was super happy and others she was awkward and almost would storm off without saying anything after class. She stopped texting me as much but continued to sit by me and also continued to study at the library together. I've been experiencing some health problems with digestive systems and I divulged all this information to her one day after class and said I was sorry for being moody. I didn't mean to create a problem if I did. She was really receptive and started to act like her normal self again while checking on me. Towards the last month and half before the semester had ended, I had started to ask her if she was available and I was trying to plan a date between just me and her. She was always honest and told me that she had already made plans. I clearly was just asking at a bad time. the last 2 weeks of school I had asked if she would be available after finals. I also texted her a message about how I like the friendship we had created over the time and I would love to hang out with you outside of school even if its just as friends. She responded with she felt the same and she would be available after finals maybe. We'll I waited after the final test we had together and she hit me with why are you still here in a tone that I wasn't expecting. I responded with well I was just waiting to see how the test went for you. I then asked her like always if she wanted a ride home and she very sternly said no and I said Ok. and then she stormed off again. 

Now she hasn't texted me at all since the break had started until a week before this next semester had started. She had asked me with how my winter break is going and If the doctors had found anything with my health problems that I had been experiencing. Of course being once again hurt I didn't really want to text her, but out of politeness I responded, but kept it short and brief. I responded with my breaks been good, how was yours and no not yet but I have scan in a few days. She responded with she was in israel and visiting family again. She then messaged me if I was excited for next semester and I responded with ehh not really. She then responded with because of classes or other things. I just responded with kind of. 

To be honest I don't know what I should do Biblically as a believer in Christ. I really do admire and like this girl a lot. I would do anything in my possible nature to help her out with anything that I can do. I'm just hurt with all of things as mentioned above. I just don't know if that I even should be texting her. When I think about just cutting her off and blocking her, I just want to cry because she really wasn't that mean to me and I'm not that type of person. I have been losing sleep and dropping weight and this constant worrying is clearly not helping me. I just don't know why she even wants to be around me if we don't even really study together. Also, why would she only invite me to the coffee shop to study when she could have asked any other person in the class. Because she knows other people besides me. ",1,1736463842.0,relationship_advice,1,0.67,False

1hxpww8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSFLeaks/comments/1hxpww8/edited_version_mixed_kind_of_positive/,"(Edited version) Mixed, kind of positive cisternogram results!","Copy of a post I made an hour or so ago; there was a development. Updated to reflect it.

People wanted updates, so here they are. With the cisternogram: in short, some indications of a leak on the first day, some indications on the second day. Also, my symptoms seem to have improved somewhat?

# Cisternogram

Lumbar puncture was a bit painful, but really not too bad. On the first day they took one picture about 2 hours after the injection, and (according to them, this is promising) saw that my various organs were lighting up. This got me kind of excited. I checked with the doctor at the clinic, and he said it would be ok for me to sit up extra to try and highlight the leak, so I did that. Unfortunately, on day 2, it looked like the CSF had fully dissipated and there was no indication of the leak, in the imaging, according to the clinic doc. However, the plegets got scanned the day after. There was, surprisingly, CSF leakage in my nose!! I do want to emphasize that I didn't expect this, I really thought they would not find anything in my nose. But they did, which was very exciting -- I'm getting a CT scan next.

# Home remedy adjacent stuff

There's been some moderately exciting news though. I keep a spreadsheet of my symptoms, with potentially relevant daily info. After using the abdominal binders, I noticed that there was some slight improvement in my symptoms even without using the binder. This was really exciting, because my symptoms had previously been slowly deteriorating, and this inspired me to read a little more literature + try a few things. I started keeping a spreadsheet and being more deliberate with my actions. Here is what I tried:

* **Reducing** caffeine intake: Since caffeine can almost double the production of CSF fluid, I would expect it to relieve symptoms but slow down healing due to increased flow out of the leak.^1 Admittedly the first day without caffeine was really really tough, but after that it got much 

* Kept electrolyte+sugar consumption unchanged. Best not to introduce too many variables.

* Started using a posture enhancing back thing, it's almost as helpful as the abdominal binder.

* (warning: woo-woo shit) Auto-hypnosis: Unfortunately the only real, recent clinical trial I could find was about burn victims and similar, but results were very statistically significant. I'm typically pretty opposed to vague woo-woo shit, but it wouldn't shock me if there was some moderately altered state that allowed us to increase/reduce blood flow to random parts of our body. The first step of healing is inflammation, so I figured this could make a difference. I've been doing this once a day for about 30 minutes, I've successfully gotten myself into a sleep-paralysis like state twice and then I tried to direct blood-flow towards my back.

^1: This is not supported by any literature and just conjecture on my part. I couldn't find studies indicating the effects of long-term caffeine consumption on CSF healing specifically. I would imagine this is a hard study to do, so this isn't too surprising. There are lots of caffeine/CSF studies, but none that I was looking for.

# Changes in condition

And now for the end results: I have actually seen, once again, huge improvements to my condition! During the day of my cisternogram, I got something like 6 hours of upright time, two days in a row, with only light-moderate pain in the last two hours. This is without using my abdominal binder, painkillers, or coffee!!! For reference, even two weeks ago, it was maybe like 30 minutes with the binder and caffeine.

Unfortunately, the day after is definitely pretty crappy, but I did also have the lumbar puncture so I'm not taking it too personally. Going forward, I will continue this testing. After the last few days, I have real hope this thing can heal even before they finally get around to fucking treating me. But we will see.

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, just some random grad student. What works for me may hurt you, depending on your situation. For the love of god check with a doctor before you try stuff, especially the 'spicier' things. I asked about abdominal binders and about standing up extra for the study. I do these experiments at my own risk, and this is explicitly not medical advice. Happy to hear any and all feedback, as long as it's thorough.",3,1736463709.0,CSFLeaks,0,1.0,False

She also started to communicate that her friends and roommates were bad influences by encouraging her to smoke marijuana and they were also loud. Which was preventing her from studying efficiently.  During a short three day break I had got the courage and asked her out to lunch hoping for a date, but she stated over text as friends which I never even pursued the lunch thing after that. We then got to class that week together and she wasn't awkward at all, but I was pretty quiet. To be honest I was really hurt and didn't want to be mean to her but for a good couple of weeks I didn't study at all with her at the library and just left without saying. Now after this there was weird moody relationship between the two of us for the rest of the semester. Somedays she was super happy and others she was awkward and almost would storm off without saying anything after class. She stopped texting me as much but continued to sit by me and also continued to study at the library together. I've been experiencing some health problems with digestive systems and I divulged all this information to her one day after class and said I was sorry for being moody. I didn't mean to create a problem if I did. She was really receptive and started to act like her normal self again while checking on me. Towards the last month and half before the semester had ended, I had started to ask her if she was available and I was trying to plan a date between just me and her. She was always honest and told me that she had already made plans. I clearly was just asking at a bad time. the last 2 weeks of school I had asked if she would be available after finals. I also texted her a message about how I like the friendship we had created over the time and I would love to hang out with you outside of school even if its just as friends. She responded with she felt the same and she would be available after finals maybe. We'll I waited after the final test we had together and she hit me with why are you still here in a tone that I wasn't expecting. I responded with well I was just waiting to see how the test went for you. I then asked her like always if she wanted a ride home and she very sternly said no and I said Ok. and then she stormed off again. 

Now she hasn't texted me at all since the break had started until a week before this next semester had started. She had asked me with how my winter break is going and If the doctors had found anything with my health problems that I had been experiencing. Of course being once again hurt I didn't really want to text her, but out of politeness I responded, but kept it short and brief. I responded with my breaks been good, how was yours and no not yet but I have scan in a few days. She responded with she was in israel and visiting family again. She then messaged me if I was excited for next semester and I responded with ehh not really. She then responded with because of classes or other things. I just responded with kind of. 

To be honest I don't know what I should do Biblically as a believer in Christ. I really do admire and like this girl a lot. I would do anything in my possible nature to help her out with anything that I can do. I'm just hurt with all of things as mentioned above. I just don't know if that I even should be texting her. When I think about just cutting her off and blocking her, I just want to cry because she really wasn't that mean to me and I'm not that type of person. I have been losing sleep and dropping weight and this constant worrying is clearly not helping me. I just don't know why she even wants to be around me if we don't even really study together. Also, why would she only invite me to the coffee shop to study when she could have asked any other person in the class. Because she knows other people besides me. ",1,1736463613.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

Seemed like a fun time outside with some bands playing music and good food, and we're not stuck in one place. Anyway that was the plan. 
I'm asking her some basic getting to know you questions as I'm driving to A show my interest and B help with my slight nervous energy. 
Now one important detail is that we're in the countryside and have to drive back to civilization lol it's not that far but it does feel quite like you're in the middle of nowhere. 
I don't know if she was extremely nervous/excited or on something but all of a sudden she started talking about bj's in cars and also being abused... I was very confused and uncomfortable. 
Then she exclaimed that I could easily pull over anywhere and do anything I wanted to her and nobody would notice!😳
My balls shriveled up so damn fast 💨! 
I'm not going to jail for your stupid fantasies thank you very much. I drove straight to the closest Tim Hortons and simply said let's get some coffee but I don't like using the drive thru. So we walked in, I went to the back for the washrooms and snuck out the side door. 
All I could think of was that song "" hit the road jack, and don't you come back no more-no more-no more""!
She was very upset as you can imagine and she did try to tell a few people in the community that I had been inappropriate with her but given that I said right away sure let's go to the police and file a report and they can question both of us and investigate your claim, the whole thing died down quickly.

What should I do?","Been told to post here. I don't know if it counts as abusive (there is abuse though), and I've been wondering if you guys will have some things to say about the issue.

My GF and I have been together for four years now. She is currently a student at university, and I finished my degree and started working. We've lived together for two years now, adopted a cat, and so far so good.

The first disagreements in our relationship started when we moved in together, regarding how messy the place had gotten sometimes. I know I'm not the most tidy, but I'm not THAT scattered, and it seems like she doesn't care. She does most of the cooking and the cleaning (which frankly I suck at, so I'd rather her do it), but I do other chores around the house. We split the bills so that's not much of an issue.

The persistent mess and other things in our daily lives resulted in a snowballing of emotions, that spiraled this year to levels way beyond what we've been used to. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells every time I tell her about something she's misplaced (and she does, a lot. I really don't want to see half-full cups of coffee on every counter in the apartment), or threw, or did something - and when she does let me know about something, I try to do it the best I can.

Sometimes she gets incredibly upset about the most minor issues (like when I ask her to put away stuff), and then she goes full-out passive aggressive and straight up unbearable. I can't not take that personally and it feels like she's punishing me just for the sake of being me when she's in the mood for it - and I don't care that she'd usually come later and apologize, which happens often. I swore to not have a relationship like my parents have, so I actually like talking about what bothers me and how it can be solved (together. I don't lecture her), but she seems like it just doesn't matter to her. She has closed up lately, and I only know the general feelings she has, and never elaborated on anything more, even before that. I'm not the most open person myself, but I try to make an effort to let her know how I feel.

I have been through an incredibly rough time in my personal life lately, and she has as well. She overworks herself with university work, and honestly, I don't know if what she picked is good for her, but if I tell her that she'd think I don't believe in her (I really do, but her parents never did, and she does need support), and then go full on passive-aggressive no talking again.

When she is angry though, she is angry. She gets incredibly aggressive and defensive, even pushes me at times, and I find it torturing even. I've experienced passive aggression and borderline abusive behavior when I was younger, with being bullied and ostracized as a teen, so the wounds are still fresh and I still black out every time this happens. I can't do anything the hours after when these ""episodes"" hit and it makes me feel like shit obviously.

More things happened lately, and an honorable mention is when I had to sleep at my parents' house to watch over their cats while they were away, she stayed at home, and suddenly a rat jumped inside the kitchen. Instead of doing anything to it she just closed herself in her room and called me (I had my phone on mute), and when I went back home to try and solve the situation the day after, she went to her parents for a few days and went super low contact. I felt like I was punished (again) for something I wasn't responsible for, and when she came back she still acted super off and reserved. For example, she promised she'd help me clean off the kitchen with bleach (as we should have), but was incredibly reluctant to do it because she was busy (the excuse she uses the most nowadays to avoid literally everything) and because she didn't trust me for scaring off the rat (which I have). So yeah

We had a big fight two days ago, which resulted in me almost crying and then her crying and apologizing. I told her that it's either we go to couples therapy or split because I genuinely can't bear with this shitty behavior every time she feels a bit off. I sent her links to couples therapists, but she dismissed them because ""they had no reviews"" (we don't have an elaborate review rating system for these. they're signed with the government and I've read some reviews when they do have them, which is why she got these links). She left the house incredibly messy, with plates all over, clothes thrown around everywhere, and like always.

So today. We were supposed to celebrate our 4th anniversary, and I booked us a place at a nice restaurant to celebrate. She came home incredibly stressed and went straight into the work room. She came up to me, gave me flowers and then asked me why I looked that angry (she ignored my calls before and when I asked her where she was she answered super vaguely). Turns out she wanted to surprise me with a picture frame collage of us, but because the bus driver back home accidentally closed the door on her while she was walking out, the frame broke, to which she reacted with smashing it on the floor from anger. She then came up to me (a few minutes before we were supposed to leave) and told me she didn't want to go because her plans didn't work. I told her it doesn't matter at all and that today is my treat, and all she needs to do is to enjoy the night.

We got to the bus stop, and I asked her how her day was. She started freaking out again and elbowed me because she said I ""forced her"" to talk about something she didn't want to (yet she brought it up). I asked her what the fuck that was all about, and whether she is punishing me again for some reason (she was passive aggressive up until that point), and then she stormed off the bus station literally two minutes before it was supposed to show up. I told her she doesn't have the keys to the apartment (only I had them on me) and as an answer she gave me the middle finger and stormed off. I felt like shit again, contemplated going by myself but then went back home. She came back a few minutes later and closed herself in our bedroom.

I'm at loss, to be honest. When she's Dr. Jekyll, she's one of the sweetest, most caring, and nice people I know - but when Mr. Hyde comes I am literally scared to have anything to do with her. What should I even do at this point? I am willing to pay for therapy for her or something, because she wouldn't talk to me elaborately about anything. I love her with all my heart, but I'm honestly super super SUPER SUPER tired with everything this brings. What can I do? What should I do? I'd obviously want to fix the whole situation and make her actually TALK about things and SHARE but I really cannot stand this type of behavior anymore.

Please ask anything related to this in the comments if I wasn't clear enough. Also, I apologize for my English.

TLDR: My [24M] GF [24F] had an ""anger episode"" today when we were supposed to go and celebrate our anniversary. We've been arguing more frequently and harder than we are used to due to hard times for the both of us, and aside for me not being able to cope with it well, I feel like absolute shit for existing, and truly at loss with my options.",1,1736463274.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False

1hxpoxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hxpoxe/was_it_completely_my_fault_advice_on_the_ending/,Was it completely my fault? Advice on the ending of a relationship (TLTR) ,"^(This is my first post on here and I am making this because I would like some feedback from outsiders perspectives. Forgive me of this length but I would like to make this as thorough as possible. This is about the ending of a relationship awhile back.) 



^(This girl (20 yo) and I (24 yo) met online and things went smoothly at first. We were only dating for about two months before we made things official. I would like to point out in the very beginning I made it clear on what my intentions were as I am someone who doesn't want to date just for fun, I am greatly looking forward to getting married and raising children although I do not expect that to come anytime soon I pretty much made it known on the first date that I wanted to date someone who had the same goal. She told me from the start she was just dating to meet people, but from my thought had changed because after a few dates we ended up going to a concert with her closest friend and her friends boyfriend. Before the concert as well I had picked her up and she ended up introducing me to her whole family which was a surprise to me. I figured it was a good sign though, on top of that, the next day she said that she had lost a bet with her mom and I asked her to explain, she said her mom and her made a bet that I would be asking her to make things official on that date. Although I would like to and was planning on leading in that direction, I still felt as if things were still early and I didnt want to rush into anything needed some more time to learn about each other. Also I explained to her that it was a bit unfair of her to share that information on me as that puts a bit of pressure on myself as I wasn't aware we were at that stage yet.) 



^(We kept the dates going and on a night where we were both dog sitting together I felt as if the time was right, we spent the evening making dinner together, watching a movie and took the dog we were sitting for a walk. It all felt really good and natural so I asked her to make it official and she said yes, awesome. Although, after that I just brought up on how initially we were at different stages on what we wanted when we met and I reminded her that in my mind I was dating with the intent to find my wife. For whatever reason she began to cry explaining that how that is so far out of the picture for her as she is still young and doesn't want to think about that for a long time. I explained and reassured her that I didn't want that anytime soon but I also didn't want to waste time with someone who wasn't really thinking about that. I felt that was odd for someone to cry in that type of situation as I feel like you would want someone to be serious about the relationship and not aiming to waste your time. We proceed past that.) 



^(Still dating and learning more about each other. Learning more I found out that she has been cheated on and has trust issues as well as a not so good self image of herself and there was a time where she flinched from my movement although I have shared with her that being physically abusive is something that I would never do as I was raised in a home witnesses such acts between my own parents and I know that is unacceptable behavior. Along with this she was not a very physical affectionate type of person from what she explained as I am more the opposite and expressed that it is an easy way to express our attraction to each other and she would say that it was too much for her. So I would work on not being as handsy I guess but I would still give plenty of complements before and after learning about her self esteem and I myself have my own qualities physically that I am not happiest with and what has worked for me is going to the gym and having an app sets automatic words of affirmation so I would share the ones with her that I saw fit. We both had expressed previously we were both attracted to each other than other people we had been with prior.) 



 ^(Proceeding further when we were going out on a date night because she was going to school at the time and just finished up a semester so I wanted to treat her to a meal and some fun that evening. We went and grabbed dinner and all was going well to start off the night. When the bill came for dinner she grabbed the tab before I even realized it was at the table and pretended to pay even though this was my treat to her and I did not want her to pay. I asked for the bill back and did not receive it so I grabbed her card from her so she could not use it, and swapped my card in to make the payment. She then got quiet and just gave me a stare as if I had done something terrible and explained that I was aggressive with her and humiliated her because I guess the waitress witnessed me grabbing her card. This is how she perceived it and I just explained that was not my experience since I made it aware before hand that I was taking care of the night as it was a celebration for her. We then went to take on the activity part of the date where we were at a large mall/outlet area that included options with arcade, axe throwing, and mini golf.) 



^(Well I guess I did a terrible job on planning a date and she was not excited to do any of those options I had planned for us, either that or she was just still aggravated with me over paying the bill. So instead of playing and hanging out and having a good time we just sat down and talked for a while. It was a normal conversation but I ended up saying that the night was somewhat ruined with her overreacting and not wanting to do anything that I had planned, although they not be the most fun activities to you it's more about spending time with one another and creating experiences and her argument was that she is a different girl and none of those options were her idea of fun. We are getting ready to leave since she was ready to end the night and so was I. While we were heading out I suggested  we should do anything else like grab dessert or something just to spend the some time together and end on a positive note. She didn't have anything in mind and said she wanted to go home so I told her I feel as if you do not want to even be with me.) 



^(She completely shut down, having never seen anyone react this way as she just began to bawl her eyes out and not say another word on the ride. While I do not want to cause someone to cry and react like this as I do care for her I did my best to reassure her in any way I could. Half way through the ride back about 20 minutes I would say from when she began her reaction she just kind of apologized and said that she wasn't expecting me say that and she does want to be together and was just saying that is her worst form of herself when she experiences something she does not want to. It's been awhile but it was something along those lines, we agreed to stop and get ice cream in hopes it would make us feel better. After talking a bit more she explained to me that she is not happy. I didn’t know how to react to that, I wanted to know more but she said she didn't want to talk about it. She reassured me that this was not because of me but something that she struggles with and I told her that we need to talk about it because I can’t help but think that I could be impacting that and would like to know what I could do to help because I do care for her. We agreed to talk about it another time. And at the very end of the night when I dropped her off she told me that she loves me. I again had no idea on how to react to that, Neither of us had said that and it was very odd timing for that to be expressed for the first time. Looking back on it maybe it was just a manipulative mood because of what I said prior. But at the time I was somewhat excited, and when the next day came around she explained that her shutdown was just a reaction because she does care for me and the relationship although her actions may not back that up. I know actions speak louder than words and told her so. She said she would work on it.)



 ^(Here are two other examples that she had an overreaction to in my opinion, One was when we had just got done being intimate with each other in the morning before starting our day and while we were out she asked how me how her oral skills compared to past partners, She always preaches about honesty and realistically she wasn't the worst or the best so I was just straight up and said I enjoyed it a lot but I have had better and i've also had a lot worse, well she didn't like that answer and just started pouting the rest of the time we hung out. I can understand being upset if you are doing your best to please your partner but also somewhat unreasonable to expect you do things the best.I also need to include that she was somewhat a judgemental person always picking out what she didnt think was proper in other peoples actions and I should have seen that as a red flag because you cant go around always thinking about what others thoughts and opinions on you are, on top of this I guess she must be one of those girls that only goes for guys 6 foot and above or some bullsh\*t because she would tell me that I was short a lot, i mean a lot, im 5’9 and she is 5’2ish. I didnt give a f\*ck because I cant do sh\*t about my height and she chose to date me anyways but she once told me that she told her dad that she would not bring home a guy that was shorter than him. Her dad is probably an easy 6’2 so that was pretty reassuring of her to tell me but I dont know how or why I even put up with this, she brought it up at dinner one time when I was with her parents and pulled out a measuring tape. Dont know what the purpose behind that could be besides to try and humiliate me?)  



^(Okay another time her reaction ruined our time together practically was another morning where we went out on a coffee date and grabbed a small pastry. She introduced me to a new coffee shop and we were deciding on a pastry to split and I was automatically drawn to some fruit coffee cake they had as I enjoy coffee cake and have never had fruit mixed with it. Once we got the coffee cake she explained how that it wa a horrible choice and its just a dry old pastry. I told her she could have got her own or gave me the recommendation letting me know that wasn't the best option here or at least something. She proceeded to be in a bad mood until we decided to stop and grab her a different pastry. After looking back on it i figure this is pretty child like behavior but in the moment I just wanted to be happy and in a positive state when we were together so Id try to do whatever to make sure we were having a good time together.) 



^(Okay so lastly. Her birthday was approaching and she had been deciding on outfit and couldn't choose. Before we went to fix that I had come over to her house on an early weekend morning to help set up a party. I'm not sure if I remember getting a thank you for doing that but thats besides the point. After the early party was over we were deciding on what to do for the rest of the day and so she wanted to go shopping and see if she could piece together her birthday outfit. Of course I had already told her that she was going to look great either way she was still not satisfied with the fit. We go to the mall together, we go to a few stores and I help her decide what i think looks best and I forget what she grabbed but ended up getting two types of bottoms from what I remember. We get to the car to head back after shopping and she asks me if I am the biggest girl I have dated or been with. I said Id just wish I could pick you up easier. I repeated to her that no not the biggest or smallest but Id like to be able to pick her up easier and I understand the way that can come off but all I meant by it was just being a man it is both fun and thrilling when we are being intimate with our partner and we just pick them up and pin our girl against the wall. Whatever im sure you know what I mean and as a girl im sure you enjoy that aspect to.) 



^(But with her being in a vulnerable and insecure position with that day of her trying to choose the right fit I should have thought a bit more before i blurted out my answer. She cried, blamed me for fat shaming and how she would not put up with that. Sure I get that but i just think the word were received in the wrong context. She asked for a break for the next day and to not communicate as she was pissed.) 



^(Understandable. I was working on an apology letter to leave her when she gives me a call and ends it saying that she wouldn't be able to look at me the same or could even think about being intimate with me again. The next day or the day after I drop off flowers and the letter that was a few pages that included an apology, basically reiterating that it was miscommunication and lack of communication because she wouldn't listen to me after she heard what she heard. Again why ask that type of question. Anyways, she responds later in the day basically saying shell need some time to think about it.) 



^(Understandable. Before this happened we had a trip planned which obviously did not happen. Our communication from texting and speaking on the phone vanished. She had updated her hinge profile, which I was upset at but was aiming to be understanding as we were not technically together. We met for a drink a few weeks later and she told me that she was going to prioritize staying busy by picking up work so that she can have money and not work while she is going to school, this was the case before so I was like okay but she explained that she didn't want it to be unfair to me as she wouldnt have as much time to commit to the relationship. She told me that she did love me and want to date me but that I shouldn't put off the option of dating myself. I was appalled as I told her it makes no sense for me to do that If i wanted to be with her and make this work. I wouldn't want to put time/effort into others if the objective was to just get back to what we were which just included better communication and a bit of understanding on each others mistakes.) 



^(Im sure you can sense that things did not workout as her heart never came back into it. I would love to hear some feedback on if this was completely on me and my lack of awareness in the situation and saying the wrong thing or if this was childish behavior on her end. Maybe there was redflags that I dismissed as well. To preface this I am christian and have spent a while before this relationship praying for my future wife to come into my life, and I probably blinded myself in a sense because of that as well as I came to the understanding that I do not think a true soulmate exists, I believe if you find a person and know that ups and downs present themselves through a relationship just like life does but you just need to choose to stick it out with that person because you do love and care for them. This definitely did have some impact on me afterwards, out of all the relationships I have been in for whatever reason this one hurt the most and I believe this is the case because it was the first relationship where I knew I wanted to aim for the long term and this has changed my perspective going forward, I've been in a few other situationships and for whatever reason this one still bothers me the most. It disgusts and pains me that I said something that hurt someone I deeply cared about, but again I truly don't know if this is truly on me since she may have been overreacting, maybe had past trauma, or was just using it as a manipulative tactic to end things. Who knows.)

^(When I was in the stage of just being more angry than anything about the waste of time and passing by her at Church I sent the following text, “I have been very hesitant to reach out for a while and I had a lot of time after the breakup to go back and think about what happened from an outside perspective. I’ve had this written and on my mind for a while now and just needed to get this off my chest. First lets go over what I said to you that caused the end of the relationship, right after we were done shopping together. I answered in a way that was not a lie and not in a cheesy way because I felt that would not have reconciled with you. Although I should have said you should not be worried/comparing yourself to my past partners because we were together and I wanted to be with you. But previously whenever I complimented you it was not received well, you claimed that you needed to take all of my compliments with a grain of salt because you felt as a significant other that was something that I was required to do. On top of that I was touchy yes, I believe physical touch as a love language is important, although it may not be top for you, everyone needs that because it is reassurance that someone is attracted to you. But you wanted me to limit that so I worked on it, but with feeling like my compliments are not being taken seriously then where does that leave me and how does that give you any reassurance. It seemed as without you knowing or it being on purpose was a form of self-sabotage. There needed to be better communication on both ends because like you said, we may have rush into things but we were excited about each other allegedly, we should have taken mode tie to truly understand and know each other first. Although I knew you had insecurities I did not know the extent of it after only knowing you for a couple months. You said I was body shaming when I couldn't even tell you how many times you called me short, hypocritical. You don’t think that would eventually eat at someone? I grew up with a brother that is much taller than me and always wanted more height because I was constantly in sports. Ive worked on not letting that hold me back because it is out of my control. And as soon as I accept that as an insecurity it would just make things worse. I have insecurities of my own believe it or not, one of the reasons why I workout so often. You even had me measure heights compared to your dad who is obviously taller than me and you told me that you told your dad that you would not bring home a guy that was shorter than him. How superficial is that, someones height does not equate to how much they care for another. I saw no flaws with you when it came to physical appearance and I tried to make that known. Could you imagine if the roles were reversed and I told you that I told my o that I wouldn’t bring a girl home if she weighed more than her or if i had you two hop on a scale to compare, obviously I wouldnt. And if you dont think calling me short is body shaming then you are just a delusional hypocrite.  Now let me ask you this, if you took someone out on a date for a little celebration of their accomplishments and then they became upset because you  made sure that you were going to cover the expenses since they were the one who did the planning and wanted to spoil you. And Then you had multiple date-like activities but they were not happy with the choices so decided to not do any of them instead. You would assume that person was not appreciative of what you were trying to do for them am I right? Why do you think I told you that night when we went to Westgate that I felt like you didn't want to be with me? Because you couldn't choose to enjoy the quality time that would have been spent on a date night. It just wasn't good enough for you. And we know what happened when we left, and then you dropped the L word on me which I didn't understand at all after all that but I believed it and was happy to hear those words come from you. Looking back on it, I don't believe that was true at all. Worse of a lie than me being worried about your family's views on my past drug usage. That wasn't true because of 3 separate reasons. you kept track of my wrongs or bads as you would say  when I never reciprocated that, “1 Corinthians 13:1 Love is patient, Love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no records of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth”) 

^(I saw that you updated your hinge, thats why i asked if you went fishing with your dad…right around the time when you went to Mexico with your fam a little after I wrote you that 3 page letter and dropped it off at your work. And somehow in response to that letter all you had to say was you needed time to think about it and say how the blue corn muffin was better. I still don't understand someone telling someone they want to make things work yet telling them to date other people. If i loved someone and wanted to make things work, that just doesn't seem like it would do either person any good. Plus saying you dont want to date other people yet had your hinge updated. Funny. As well as saying you want things to work and start over yet your communication just went to shit. To top that off you completely ignored me on a day we agreed to meet and I was going to open up and explain to you my concerns with us and my own insecurities but you still viewed my instagram stories and couldn't give me any type of update on what was going on and I had to call the next day. I don't believe anyone who had love for someone would do that. All in all, that shit is much worse lying about compared to me with my drug usage since i was still new around your family and had no idea howd i be judged for it or how they would react to it.) 

^(I don't care if you respond or not, I just wanted you to think about that and I hope you give whatever future partner you have a little more grace and don't let your insecurities get in the way. Take car of yourself”)

^(I look forward to getting your feedback on this)
