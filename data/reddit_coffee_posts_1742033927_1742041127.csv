I have been talking to a guy now for about 12 days on text and we met for one date for coffee and breakfast that he planned and initiated. Before meeting we were texting in a continuum and had a banter. We met Saturday and I think that the date went well with 2/3 awkward moments but he didn’t reach out and I finally reached out Tuesday to which he replied immediately and enthusiastically. Since then I have been reaching out almost every other day to which his responses are quick and we have a banter but he doesn’t initiate texting. We met last Saturday ( so a week now) and I’m wondering if he just isn’t that much into me and if it would be ok from my end to ask if he wants to come for a stand up show or something fun. I do think he took more initiative with texting before we met and it’s ok if he isn’t into me, just need to see if this goes forward. I’m also worried about seeming too clingy or forward!

\----

DX: Methane Dominant SIBO (IBS-C type)

ROOT CAUSE:

My root cause for sibo is abdominal adhesions from poor healing after endometriosis surgery in 2018. The surgery was successful and I am endo free, however my ex's cat jumped on my stomach just a couple days after surgery and any trauma to the surgical area makes adhesions much more likely. Adhesions make you much more prone to SIBO, and though I didn't get it at first I did start having SIBO symptoms a couple years after. The symptoms really came to a head during the pandemic when I had become quite sedentary; also a risk factor for SIBO.

In 2023 I attempted an adhesiolysis surgery with the same surgeon who did my endo excision, and though the surgery itself was successful unfortunately because of the inflammation from the SIBO combined with some poor post surgical advice from the nurses I ended up with even worse adhesions than before. Because of the worsened adhesions I ended up even having a ""transient bowel obstruction"" according to the ER doc, which had me in hyperemisis for hours until it thankfully passed on it's own.

\----

TREATMENTS ATTEMPTED:

(sometime in 2021 I transitioned to the low fodmap diet; gas and bloating symptoms were (mostly) managed with it if I was extremely strict, though the constipation persisted and was quite painful and uncomfortable. This wasn't a SIBO treatment attempt persay, more palliative but thought I should include it )

* first attempt, summer 2021: generic rifaximin from india, ordered by the GI who diagnosed me with SIBO from a breath test. It didn't work and had awful side effects including a rare side effect of intense bladder pain during the course of treatment. GI doc shrugged her shoulders and had no further suggestions. I dumped her from my team shortly after.
* second attempt, Jan 2023: I thought I should tackle the root cause; which in retrospect was the right idea but the wrong method. Online many sources will say the only way to treat abdominal adhesions is with surgery, despite surgery being the cause of adhesions. Naively I believed that, despite less invasive alternatives being available. See above for awful results of that.
* third attempt, Mid 2023: out of desperation, I went on my local subreddit and asked for any recommendations for doctors in my area who have had success treating SIBO. I was directed to an evidence based ND, who uses a combination of prescriptions and herbals. I was able to get in to see her a few weeks later and started treatment. We tried a few things, including sun fiber and motility supplements and I had some minor improvements in motility but not in other SIBO symptoms. My ND told me motility is key to clearing SIBO especially Methane/IBS-C type so this was my first step in the right direction.
* fourth attempt, Novermber 2023: the adhesions were killing me and the thought of another bowel obstruction terrified me, so I looked into alternative treatments and found clear passage therapies. The treatment is very expensive, very intense, and for most people requires travel. It definitely helped my adhesions, but I needed more treatment than what is normally recommended due to the severity of my adhesions. After 1 week of clear passage they were improved but only about 30%-40% so I knew I would need further treatment later. Clear Passage also helps people with SIBO, and along with their manual intense massage therapy to help break up the biofilm they recommended Biocidin Remove to treat it: 15 drops, 2x a day 10-20 mins before meanls. IMPE Biocidin DOES WORK especially at dismantling the biofilm SIBO hides in, however I got the memo too late for it to help much during my first clear passage treatment. Ideally, you are supposed to be up to the full dose of biocidin before treatment at Clear Passage if trying to treat SIBO. Since my main goal was adhesion and obstruction treatment, they were focused on that and hadn't shared about Biocidin til my first day of Clear Passage.
* fifth attempt, May 2024: after a few false starts with the biocidin-- you have to ramp up the dose slowly or else the side effects can be intense and unpleasant, and I was overeager-- I was able to work my way up to the recommended dose. I started having some die off symptoms during this time, for a couple days every couple weeks I would be gassier and get a little bit of hives & night sweats. I contacted clear passage again to set up another round of treatment, this time with another therapist as my first therapist had left the company. After discussing with both my ND and my Clear Passage therapist we decided I would try rifaximin again during my clear passage therapy while continuing the biocidin and motility supplements. This time I got name brand rifaximin from canada, and OH BOY! Finally!! a combnination that REALLY WORKED!! The die off was HUGE. The gas I was passing from the die off was HORRIBLE and FREQUENT. We had to change the sheets EVERY NIGHT from me sweating it out. But it was finally actually working!! I wasn't out of the woods yet, but it was amazing feeling like something was finally helping me make headway in my treatment\~
* sixth attempt, Sept 2024: Following Clear Passage I stayed on the 15 drops 2x a day  biocidin regimen. Over the summer the die off lessened and I was able to tolerate yellow and red light servings of various fodmaps with zero to minimal sypmtoms, when yellow used to lay me up with terrible gas pains & bloating. But I was still having some symptoms, as well as  pain from the adhesions so I signed up for another round of clear passage and canadian rifaximin hoping for this to be the nail in the coffin. I ended up with yet another therapist as she was closer, but she wasn't my favorite. She just didn't do things the same as the other two therapists, and didn't listen to me as much. I also caught a nasty cold during the treatment, which I think caused extra inflammation and contributed to my lackluster results with my adhesion treatment progress from this round. I ended up waiting to do the rifaxmin until my body had fully recovered from the cold, and had a little extra die off this time but no where near as intense as the first time.
* \-Japan Tangent, Oct 2024: About a month after finishing that last round of rifaxmin my then boyfriend (at the end of the trip fiance!)  took our dream trip to Japan we have been talking about since our first date! I ate so many amazing foods there and had basically zero reaction to fodmaps while on the trip. We went exploring on our own and found gluten free (I do GF as I have an allergy to wheat) karaage, curry, ramen, udon, bento boxes, dorayaki, etc etc and again, basically zero reaction despite the onions, garlic, beans etc. It went so much better than I ever could've dreamed! Unfortunately though, I wasn't the most consistent about taking my biocidin during this time. I tried to remember to take it twice a day, but our itinerary was packed and I am a forgetful gal when I'm not in my routine. There were many days where I only took it once, and some where I forgot to take it entirely. This was the start of a bad habit that set me back a lot.
* \-Return from Japan & return of symptoms, Nov 2024 & Dec 2024: We were in Japan for the majority of October and came back Nov 1st. We came back from beautiful, relatively warm, exciting Tokyo to our house in rainy, gloomy Washington state. I have SAD anyways from living here, but the combination of coming back and coming down from our dream trip to awful weather and shortening days AND the political situation that happened a few days after... This was one of my worst SAD seasons yet. I totally fell off the wagon. I was doing an awful job of taking care of myself. Not only had I barely taken any biocidin during this time, but I also basically went back to being sedentary after spending much of the year working on my fitness and being as active as I could tolerate. Two big no nos for SIBO and one big no no for keeping the adhesions in check. After a couple of months like this, I started having some belching and bloating again with fodmaps. I knew I needed to get my shit together, and that's what I'm doing now.
* \-Seventh/current attempt, January 2025-current: Starting around the end of last year, I started working my way back up on the biocidin dose. I've been having intermittent die off again since, and have been able to tolerate more fodmaps again. More recently I have also found a new adhesion treatment which can be performed locally, which I believe is also helping fight the SIBO. The treatment is called Softwave TRT; it is a unique version of shock wave therapy that works to help break down scar tissue and encourage blood flow and healing factors to migrate to the treatment site to help your body to heal and regenerate. It is usually used for soft tissue injuries, but can be used for abdominal adhesions as well. It also can be used for persistent biofilm based infections, as the shock wave ""knocks the bacteria out of the biofilm"" also helps your body break down and remove the biofilm so antimicrobials can treat the infection. Since starting this treatment my die off from the biocidin has reminded me of the extra die off I got during my second round of clear passage; though not quite as intense. Some contributing factors may be: biocidin only vs biocidin + rifaximin, duration of treatment (softwave is 10 mins 1-2x/week over several weeks or months, clear passage is 4hrs/day 5x/week for 1+ week(s)), and amount of microbes & biofilm present. In any case, I am still getting a lot of the same symptoms of sweats, hives and gas despite them not being as terrible or as frequent as during clear passage.

NOTES:

Along with the biocidin ""remove"" products (I have used all 3 varieties), I use their GI Detox pills. This absorbs the nasties that the microbes release as they are killed, and helps keep die off symptoms more manageable. I didn't use these during my rifaxmin treatments as I was worried about it absorbing the medication, but in retrospect I think I could've managed the timing so I would've been less miserable especially during the second rifaxmin course.

I have had to take magnesium supplements for the past several years, or else I get painfully constipated. That was true during this entire process. I am still on them now, but taking less. At my peak I was taking 2400mg, right now I am taking half that at 1200mg!

I also take the Silver Fern Motility supplement, but it has less of a direct daily effect than the magnesium. My ND insisted I stay on a motility supplement indefinitely because we are fighting an uphill battle with my adhesions. She at one point suggested a prescription motility regulator to help, but I didn't want to try it as it has a (admittedly low) chance of mood changes and I already struggle with that.

During most of this process I have also had to have coffee every day to stimulate a BM. There have been 2 times where I have consistently not had to do this: For a couple weeks in japan, when my SIBO was at an all time low AND I was walking 5+ miles a day. and drum roll.... NOW!!! The past week or more I haven't had to have coffee to have a BM!! And I am currently nursing an ankle injury so I'm not very active at the moment either. This, I can only think is from the softwave treatment which is helping to break up the adhesions, encourage blood flow and treat /remove the sibo & biofilm.

I have plans with my ND to make my system more resilient going forward with probiotics and other various supplements to help prevent recurrence.

This is not an exhaustive list of every little thing I tried, I left out a lot of the bunk that didn't work before my first round of rifaxmin.

TLDR/ FINAL THOUGHTS ABOUT TREATMENTS:

adhesiolysis: just don't, especially if you haven't cleared your SIBO before the surgery. expensive, brutal, and made things much worse for me.

rifaxmin: works best with a biofilm removal treatment, impe doesn't work without one. Powerhouse when you've got a biofilm treatment in tandem! canadian name brand seems to have less side effects than indian generic, and is about 1/5 of the cost of buying in the US.

biocidin: this was an absolute game changer. it treats the sibo and the biofilm, but especially tackles the biofilm. it is much more gradual than antibiotics; it takes a month or two to work up to the highest dose without feeling awful IMPE, and it took about 5 months at the highest dose ( plus the rifaxmin which I started when I was 1 week into the highest biocidin dose ) to get the results I had while I was in Japan. My clear passage therapist said that it can clear SIBO on its own, but will take longer than if used with rifaximin. She also said you need to stick with a maintenance dose for several months after achieving symptom remission to make sure it doesn't recur-- something I obviously didn't follow.

clear passage: extremely expensive, I'm talking $5k for a week of treatment plus travel expenses. The first two rounds were worth it IMO especially concerning my adhesions & obstruction, but the last round didn't feel worth it due to middling results. Therapists are hit and miss; my favorite who still works there is Sharon in Missouri though who I would highly recommend. She specializes in SIBO treatments and had it herself, so she's very empathic and knowledgable. She told me she has kept it at bay for over a decade now.

softwave trt: I think this, and being religious about my biocidin may be my final chapter in SIBO treatments. It's not cheap, but a hell of a lot cheaper than clear passage. My provider charges based on how much electricity we use, so the bill varies from $100-$150 a session. I am only 4 sessions in of a recommended 12-15 sessions, and am already seeing some results with BM and die off. It is also definitely helping my adhesions, as I feel less stiff and stuck together. I plan to do the full recommended amount of sessions, and then maintenance sessions every couple of months to keep the adhesions and SIBO at bay, and will report back about my final results later this year.

rearview 20:20 : If I could do it all over again, here's what I would do.\*\*\*\*

1. Never even think of adhesiolysis. Banish it from my mind.
2. Work with Clear Passage on adhesions and SIBO; get to full biocidin dose BEFORE Clear Passage therapy and take rifaximin and biocidin during treatment
3. Continue biocidin, and start softwave.

\*\*\*\*If I didn't have such severe adhesions, I might've skipped Clear Passage and just done the biocidin + rifaximin with softwave instead as the effect on SIBO alone seems similar.

\* If my fiance and I didn't have the budget for it, I would've skipped Clear Passage then too-- but if it isn't a hardship I would recommend it for severe adhesions.

I hope this long winded story helps someone who was as lost as I was a few years ago when I started this journey. Please feel free to ask me any questions, and I'll do my best to answer.

So, I’m based in Dubai, born and raised there, and whenever I visit Jordan, I usually end up in Irbid. It’s been five long years since my last visit, and do not have an understanding of what to expect, and I’m now considering opening a specialty coffee shop in Amman, inspired by **Truth Coffee Roasting (Cape Town)** but with some unique twists.

Before conducting a feasibility study and start crunching numbers, I wanted to get a sense of whether this concept would appeal to the local market. From what I’ve seen, many cafes in Amman (like BLK, Arabica, etc.) focus more on standard offerings, but I feel the **""experience"" aspect of coffee culture is missing**.

I’ve allocated a budget of around **150K JD** and would love to hear your thoughts:

* Do you think a concept like this would stand out in Amman?
* What kind of coffee shop experiences do you feel are missing in the city?
* Would you personally be interested in a more immersive, high-end coffee experience?

Ever wanted to turn your handwritten notes directly into Anki flashcards? I built [NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/) to solve this exact problem! It works with any note-taking app (Noteful, GoodNotes, Notability, Nebo, OneNote) - all you need is a PDF export.

[Left - PDF notes with flashcard co-existing with normal pages, Right - Only extract flashcard page into Anki](https://preview.redd.it/huu61q5tqrhe1.png?width=2726&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed2326cd2101ab2dcc6bafbe44d89c5161c24f09)

# Key Features

* **Works with any PDF note-taking app**
* **Preserves your handwriting and diagrams**
* **Automatic duplicate detection**
* **Multiple processing modes**
* **Free**

# How It Works

**1. Take notes and create flashcards in Noteful app along with your regular notes. Flashcards can just be another page within your notebook. It just needs a differentiating factor (either dimensions or by having a Question/Answer marker). You can download this page and add it as a template to Noteful so that it can be inserted to a notebook when a flashcard needs to be created.** [**https://notesankify.com/flashcard-template**](https://notesankify.com/flashcard-template)

[Add this page as a template and copy-paste questions\/answers into it.](https://preview.redd.it/e3r4u75c8uoe1.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4c1c1dd9fd78f978f0a64df42347c49b0a757a)

**2. Export/backup your notes as PDF (e.g., Noteful backup to Google Drive or share as PDF to a folder)**

**3. Run** [**NotesAnkify**](https://notesankify.com/) **on your folder containing all the PDF files.**

**4. The flashcards are extracted from each note and appear in Anki automatically!**

# Different Methods to Create Flashcards

1. **Use the flashcard template** ([Download here](https://notesankify.com/flashcard-template/))
2. **Add QUESTION/ANSWER markers** on any page
3. Use any **specific page dimension**.
4. **Split any page** into top (question) and bottom (answer)

# Smart Duplicate Handling

[NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/) uses content hashing to prevent duplicates:

* Same cards across different notes? Added only once. (This takes care of the issue where Noteful tagging system creates duplicate PDF files. Each flashcard will only be exported once.)
* Made a small change? Treated as a new card
* Your Anki deck stays clean and organized!

# Deck Organisation

* Organise Anki decks with nested sub-decks mimicking the folder structure of your notes.

# Useful Links

* [Website & Documentation](https://notesankify.com)
* [Download NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/#download)
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kpauljoseph/notesankify)

# Why I Built This

I was tired of:

* Manual flashcard creation in Anki
* Being locked into proprietary features (like GoodNotes Studysets)
* Maintaining separate pdf files for notes and flashcards

1jbt24o,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1jbt24o/yet_another_positive_experience_in_germany/,Yet another positive experience in Germany,"Hi everyone, I'd like to add about my experience in Germany and maybe add some lifehacks.

In general, I think you should judge regarding 'how bad it can be'. I came as a refugee from Russia, and I was with my family in a refugee camp. Everyone was very friendly and they gave us an apartment, and treated us well, especially with medical procedures and vaccinations, there was an interpreter for that, a highly qualified woman. There was not enough food in the camp, but you could always buy something in the shop. Overall I think they did the best they could, and they sent us to another refugee camp as fast as they could, and after that, I got an apartment.

I had two interviews with BAMF (September 2022), trey provided the interpreter of course, and I told him my reasons and what was happening in Russia, what in particular was dangerous for my ex (a Ukrainian) and my daughter. He listened attentively and after I finished he said: ""I have no more questions"". As I understand, BAMF delegates the decision to give refugee status to local authorities, and I got it after I got the full-time contract. One man in a language school helped me a lot with that, also at a language school (it's called an integration course) they rewrote my CV according to German standards.

During job interviews I spoke English only, they spoke English and German. Working from November 2023 allowed me to pay for online language courses and solve obvious everyday issues. All the co-workers were kind and supportive, but people are the same everywhere, so people with negative attitudes live here as well. It's just that nobody is allowed here to treat you like shit, which I felt all the time being like a middle-class citizen in Russia. I've never heard anything negative about being Russian (including Ukrainians) or speaking the poor German language. Quite the opposite, everyone encouraged me to learn German and admitted that it was quite difficult.

My daughter (13 y.o.) suffered some stress, but I talked with her teacher and a psychologist in school about her case, asked for help with integration, and they found an after-class group, which helped. She got two friends, one girl from Syria or something, and a German girl. She also plays handball, which she enjoyed playing in Russia, they play regularly with teams from other towns. At the end of this half-year at school, they officially offered her transit to the Gymnasium, because she's good at math and German, and overall she rocks, I'm very proud of her.

I work in another town, so I commute 4 hours a day using public transport (bus and train), I work 1 day from home. So, I get up at 5 a.m., walk with the dog (meet some people coming to work), have breakfast and my train leaves at 7 a.m. In the evening I get home at 7 p.m., walk with my dog, have a German class from 8 to 9 p.m., and go to bed at 10-11 p.m. German is 5 days per week, a Saturday morning and 4 evenings during a workweek (I tried, but I can't take more). Well, it's feasible, I do not complain. German is a priority, I'm finishing B2 in a month and starting C1, but it also needs practice, so I have some practice at work.

A few lifehacks for learning German:
- Don't overwhelm yourself, take breaks and breathe, it comes with a systematic effort and time
- Focus on speaking
- Fucking speak as much as you can, use every opportunity, no excuses 
- Switch your smartphone to German
- Write a diary in German

Till the end of June, they cut my position, but everything was quite friendly, no accusations, there's just not enough work for a full-time position. Maybe it's a 'magic kick' I need to go further. To get a job, I think I need:

- German C1, I have a gap here, so I need some networking/recommendations
- Looking for local companies also helps, I mean they can lack personnel, compared to Munchen, Berlin, and Hamburg
- Verifying a diploma may help, I think I should do it as well
- Having a driving license helps a lot if you're outside a big city
- Being qualified for the job and overall positive helps as well

Regarding the costs, I'd share the following lifehacks:

- Commuting with a German ticket for 58 EUR and/or a bicycle
- Don't buy a car -- many companies lease cars and give them to employees
- Plan your menu and cook at home
- Don't buy cheap stuff, buy stuff that lasts, see reviews at Amazon, for example
- Don't buy new stuff: I bought a used laptop at Amazon, a 3d-printer at eBay, and 4 bicycles and a motorcycle at Kleinanzeigen
- Read guides about electricity and heating use, for example: induction stove

Regarding friends and dating, I have not much to say, I was going through a divorce and personal issues for the last 2 years and came into shape in January this year, but I noticed this:

- If you don't have a vision of your future in Germany, it's easy to get depressed.
- If you eat a lot (and the food is tasty), or drink a lot (and beer is cheap), it hurts your mental health, so one more reason to cook healthy food at home and cut off the beer.
- I don't know yet, how Germans get new friends, but there is a Meet5 app, where they invite you to some biketours or meetings.
- I also think you can get new friends riding a motorcycle, the season has just started.
- Germans have a WhatsApp chat for a town, according to my friends it's a great opportunity to meet new people by helping them: assemble the furniture, for example

A few advantages of living in a smaller town:

- Beurocracy is a lot faster -- they just don't have so many people
- Driving schools are cheaper
- Job search is (probably) not so crazy as two AIs (HR's and candidate's) fighting with each other

Some insights regarding Germans:

- Speaking (even trying to speak) German and being positive helps connect with people a lot -- just be yourself
- I feel some Germans suffer depressive conditions, trying to stay positive; my theory is that it comes from the lack of challenges and perspectives, especially in small towns (don't fall into that -- see above regarding the vision)
- Germans can be 'local' and 'global', and that's not good or bad. Imagine living in a small town, speaking German only, knowing no people from other cultures. My driving instructor was a local guy, a former firefighter, what a nice man (and straightforward as fuck)! Global means speaking English, traveling to other countries, being eager to accept cultural differences, and connect with foreigners.

And the main lifehack: look at the bright side. It's like in the movie Pollyanna. So, what do I have in common with Germans, and what makes me comfortable here:

- Attention to detail about technics, craft
- Being professional and trying to reach perfection
- Being direct and honest
- Having deep conversations, also about politics
- Laughing at my jokes :)

BTW, next week (17-21 March) I'll be in Frankfurt (am Main), you can DM me for a cup of coffee and a conversation.

This post is intentionally biased with positivity because there's enough negativity on the Internet already. :)

1jbt1bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1jbt1bp/routine_establishment_and_dosage/,Routine establishment and dosage,"Hi, I started taking 20mg lisdexamfetamine for my ADHD today (the first ADHD med I ever got prescribed) - took it around an hour ago and I don't think/can't tell if I'm feeling any effects already. My psych said the dose is low so I shouldn't expect to feel any big changes (I'm F23, with a 168cm tall 62kg body if that matters).

Tldr:  I know it's different for everyone but i wanted to ask about experiences and tips with (establishing) the routine, the longevity of it's effect and nutrition

The first thing (I will have to figure this out by myself of course, take it as a safety precaution) I have it prescribed to take in the morning, but I am worried about the supposed crash after the effects wear off. The pharmacist said to take it at the same time every day but had doubts about it because of my shift work (7am-3pm and 3pm-11pm). How are you dealing with that? In your experience, would you still take it at the same time every day or change the time of dosage based on the shift of the day? I read that I can dissolve the capsule in water, but I'm not sure if it's necessary to drink immediately, or if it's safe and effective to spread it through the day. 

Another thing is - I am a big fan of caffeine (minimum 2 black coffees everyday, bonus of an energy drink or two on the days I work), how does that affect the intensity and longevity of the medication?

Last thing; what vitamins/minerals/other nutritional things should I be careful about? There is a lot of talk about Vitamin C, magnesium and protein in this subreddit, still I'm not sure how it connects or helps. 
+ has it helped anyone to quit caffeine and nicotine? 

OH and I would also like to mention I have clonazepam prescribed for anxiety, should I be worried about interactions of the substances? (I do not take it regulary of course, I just want to be careful)

Once again - I know it's different for everyone and I'm not looking for medical advice but I'd like to know other people's experience with it.

1jbsyfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jbsyfb/how_can_i_32f_not_feel_resentful_that_i_make/,How can I (32F) not feel resentful that I make significantly more money and work significantly more hours than my husband (36M)?,"I (32F) have been married for almost 7 years to my husband (36M). When we first got married I made around 60K a year. We got married and I went back to school for three hard and stressful years, where he provided financially for us, and now make \~225K a year. He makes around 85K a year. I have a highly stressful job in healthcare and work around 45 hours per week. He is very lucky and works from home and I would say on average works two hours a week (I know that sounds crazy but it's just how his job works apparently). He is very sweet, he makes my smoothie and coffee in the morning as I have to leave pretty early for work (around 0545). He does the grocery shopping during the day and if I ask him to clean something in the house he'll do it without complaining. The issue is I cannot help but feel resentful of the fact that not only do I make significantly more money, but also have to work over 40 hours a week when I know he is at home playing video games much of the day and only actually having to work a small part of the day (maybe just has to answer a few emails). When I get off work around 7pm he won't have dinner ready unless I specifically ask him to make ""xyz"" on the way home from work. On top of that, certain things aren't taken care of that I wish would be without me having to specifically ask for them to be taken care of. For example, we forgot about the homestead exemption this year so we missed out on that. Since he stays home, I wish those kinds of things were taken care of without me having to remind him.

I would love to be able to stay at home, especially if we were to have children in the future, but the difference is if it were turned around I would have dinner ready for him when he got home and he wouldn't have to ask me to do different things around the house during the day- they would just be done (this might be the difference between a man and a woman?). I also have decision fatigue at work so when he asks what I want for dinner, I kind of just wish he would say ""hey were having xyz for dinner, see you when you get here"". We have talked about all of this before but it hasn't seemed to get any better for me. I still feel resentful when I call him after a long stressful day and ask what's for dinner, and he says ""well we have salmon and beef we could make, what do you want?"" I do want to have children but I also feel like I'll still have to work full-time, and make most of the decisions with them and have to do most of the childrearing. How can I not feel resentful of making more money, working significantly more hours every week with a stressful job, and then having to ask for things around the house to be done while he's at home? Please help and thanks in advance. (this is a throwaway account)

TLDR: I can't help but feel resentful of the fact that I make significantly more money, work significantly longer hours and have to make certain decisions in the home with my husband. I feel like if we had children, I would have to do the majority of the decision making and childrearing. How can I not feel this way?",6,1742037681.0,relationship_advice,78,0.58,False

2. **Started treating weekdays vs weekends differently** I go harder on academics Monday-Thursday so I can be more flexible Friday-Sunday. Having this structure made a huge difference mentally.
3. **Found the right study environment** Turns out I can't study in my room (too many distractions) or in complete silence (too intense). Coffee shops with background noise are my sweet spot. Finding this cut my study time by like 30%.
4. **Made better friends, honestly** Ditched the people who made me feel bad about studying AND the ones who made me feel bad about going out. Found friends who have similar goals and respect when I need to work.
5. **Scheduled EVERYTHING** Put social events AND study blocks in my calendar. Having both visually mapped out stopped me from overcommitting and then stressing.

She says she wants nothing to do with him and he scares her, but if that’s the case why wouldn’t she just block him in the first place?

Silver needle was a little better, less bitter, but still funky for my liking.

1jbslng,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1jbslng/adverse_reaction_to_caffeine_pills/,Adverse Reaction to Caffeine Pills?,"     Hello all! I’m sure most of you are used to having to perform daily tasks to try and (sometimes unfruitfully) prevent a migraine from occurring. Since the weather has been shifting so much lately, I(21F) wanted to try and get a jump on my migraine before it hit and ruined my date by taking caffeine pills. My doctor explained to me that a caffeine deficiency might be a cause for my migraines and caffeine pills might help.
     Now, typically, I don’t really take caffeine pills. Usually, I just try to get any caffeine I need out of a Mountain Dew or whatever and that usually works. I have taken the pills in the past, but they were my mom’s and I haven’t been able to use the brand she used. So when I moved for college and I knew I was gonna be alone, I tried to get my own pills. Another reason for getting these pills besides a “just in case” thing is because I spend a significant amount of time over at my boyfriend’s house. He lives with his parents and his step-mom is like, a super strict dietitian or something. So the only thing they ever have to drink at their house is water and (if I’m lucky) milk. Also, my pop isn’t allowed in the house anyway so I can’t just bring my own stash, unfortunately. So I was like “oh well I’ll just take some of these pills before I go over to his house and it’ll be fine!” …
     The first time it happened was when we were celebrating a family member’s birthday. I take the pills and go to his house. I felt fine for ~20 minutes, the only effect was I felt kind of goofy (like a bit lightheaded and I couldn’t really focus on what was going on), but I was like “I’m probably just tired or something and it’ll get better when the pill takes effect.” 10 minutes in and we start having cake. It’s soooooo yummy looking and, wait, what the hell? I don’t have any appetite. Well, black coffee suppresses your appetite, so it’s probably just a side effect of the pill (sadly, as I really wanted a slice of cake). Although this is kind of weird bc I don’t remember this happening with my mom’s caffeine pills. 10 minutes after that and I feel SUPER tired, so I have to withdrawal from the party and go lay down. :/ 
     And this is where it starts getting kind of bad. I wasn’t able to sleep and I kind of just laid with my eyes closed for ~30min-1hr. My boyfriend comes in to check on me and lay with me and I felt better, until I got SUPER nauseous out of nowhere. Then, I feel my body burning up. Uh oh, this is usually how I feel when I have a “super migraine” that makes me have to go to the hospital. My poor boyfriend is trying to care for me, but i can barely even communicate what’s wrong, because if i keep my mouth open i feel like I’m gonna spew everywhere. Then I start shaking super intensely. to cut it short, this happened for the rest of the day and I had to spend the night at his house because I couldn’t even STAND UP. A rational person would think it was the caffeine pills, but I was like “no, it was just unfortunate timing with a migraine.” 
     It happened again today, as I didn’t want to drink any pop since we were gonna go on a long walk, and drinking pop while walking kind of hurts my tummy. Take the caffeine pill, I’m fine for like an hour-an hour 30 minutes or so and then BANG! The nausea. I thought it was because the shorts I was wearing were tight on my stomach, so I lower them to sit at my waist instead of over my stomach. And then the intense heat. And, of course, the shaking. This time I was like “f it, we gotta get to my house to get my nausea pills before it gets worse!” I got the nausea pills, and I also took a migraine pill, ibuprofen (for the fever reducer qualities), and Benadryl to essentially make sure I’d fall right asleep so I couldn’t puke up the nausea pills before it took effect.
     When we got back, my poor boyfriend was running around like a chicken with his head cut off trying to care for me. Getting me ice packs, closing the curtains, making a cove for me on the ground that blocked out the sun that was coming in THROUGH the curtains, getting a bucket for me, etc. I kept twitching and involuntarily moving my arms and legs around. Eventually, I got to kind of sleep, but then I was woken up my a phone call ( D:!!!), and I was no longer nauseous or hot! 🎉 but I was suddenly super cold and still shaky, and I knew if I shook too much it’d make me nauseas again. SO THEN I had to bundle up and I slept for A LONG TIME.

TL;DR I tried taking caffeine pills bc I never had problems with them before, but I do now and I had really bad side effects. (Nausea, extreme heat, shaking) Have you guys ever had this happen before?? Or am I just allergic to the brand I got/caffeine pills as a whole? (Predictably, I am never ever taking these pills again LOL)",1,1742036219.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

It's far more than just being ""a little tired,"" as people often assume. The brain fog, sleep attacks, and cataplexy that makes you feel as though your body isn't even yours are invisible to them.

I've had family members urge me to ""just drink more coffee,"" friends roll their eyes when I cancel plans, and coworkers act as though I'm just making excuses. If only everything were that easy. The worst thing is when people think I'm fine with living this way and don't want to try. It’s exhausting having to explain over and over again what narcolepsy actually is. Some days, I just give up and stay quiet because it feels like no one really listens anyway. But other days, I wish I could make people understand, just for a moment, how much it impacts my life.

For anyone else feeling misunderstood, how do you deal with it? Do you educate people or just let it go?",2,1742035466.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

Everything was a delight! Daydreaming of the next time I get to feast on these again 🥹

Top favorite is of course Netong’s la paz batchoy followed by Tatoy’s seafood. Need I say more about these two?

Kap Ising’s molo soup was a comforting bowl of warmth on a random rainy morning. Their empanada was carby and flaky, just the way I like it! 

For coffee, Sol’s vanilla bean latte was really good (PSA: they use real vanilla bean seeds!) Neighbor’s dirty horchata was likewise very bold and flavorful, not watered down like the ones I’ve tasted in Manila and LU (ehem). Madge’s coffee was too sweet for my liking, so I don’t think I’ll have it again. Their cheesy betchokoy put a smile on my face as I bit into it though 😊 Dripple’s peach mango iced tea in the driving range was sooo refreshing on a sunny afternoon! They use real tea bags too and not instant tea powders that are 70% sugar :)

For fastfood, I tried J’s burger and holy hell, why are we paying almost 400 for Sweet Ecstasy when J’s burger charges 150 for something better?! We also had KalanPH chicken sandwich delivered to the hotel for midnight snack— the chicken fillet was soft and juicy; however, I bit on a piece of cartilage and that gave me a massive ick (!!) I stopped eating the rest of it (I was two bites in) 😞 JD bakery’s baked macaroni reminds me of Jolly spaghetti in a way, with the sweet ketchupy sauce and grated Eden’s cheese topping, the kind your friendly neighbor serves on fiestas— just nostalgic. 

Meanwhile, Roberto’s siopao definitely didn’t disappoint! It didn’t need any sauce to give it that sweet umami— perfect for an afternoon snack to keep you going the rest of the day.

Breakthrough’s was alright. If I had to pick between it and Tatoy’s though, I’d go for Tatoy’s. 

For dessert, I went to Camiña Balay Nga Bato— their tsokolate batirol was so decadent. They offer free refills, but I couldn’t bring myself to ring the tiny little bell for it 😆

For modern dining, we went to Punot to try their molo ball crunch and chicken inasal. They were okay lang, just your typical Manila-style restaurant with almost the same pricing. 

Giuseppe, on the other hand, always takes the cake (pun intended). Oh my lord, that tiramisu cake~ 🎶

Haay Iloilo, kanamit gid! I can’t wait to be back!

On the shores of the lake
I once
mistook
for the Pacific Ocean;
I might have confessed,
That I would not walk through fire for you,
Though I knew you to be an angel.
 
Flames of abandon; those tender coals,
Like foals, we were electrically prancing under stage lights.
 
The path lit by embers,
I could burn both of our feet;
You shake your head,
Call me foolish—
“Why do you always do this?”
 
“I’m tired.”
Of finishing other people’s sentences,
of taking burns when they’re the ones
who needed repentances,
but I will treat my wounds for you.
 
Pt. 2 (Gas Giants)
 
Sonic heartbeat
and
“in her blooms an idea.”
The vibrations shook us to our core.
Because I knew —I know—
that you’ve been hurt before.
 
You see my dear,
Eurydice still sits in my dreams,
But I’ll never cross the river styx for
laser beams;
those eyes—
again.
 
So, watch me dance,
and watch my celestial glow,
Because you and I both know,
That we would rather be strong for each other.
 
I see it in your gaze,
Like two gas giants,
Jupiter’s twins, crème coffee,
those amber pairs…
Of eyes that can see that right now,
I would not walk through fire for you;
at least not while we can see the ocean.
 
Pt. 3 (Innerbloom)
 
But I am learning.
Learning to see things as they are.
To not lose
you or myself
in the commotion,
of real love again.
 
Because this energy will not be denied—
And one day, you will watch me
walk through
this impalpable flame
 
I’ll be careful not to rush over coals and raging wires,
So that we may bloom incombustibly
 
this time.
And a lone puddle might’ve dried up on lakeshore drive,
 
But for now;
You’ll hold me between our unwritten pages
just right.

Coyote: “No I know that’s not true. You mention that she still sits in your dreams while talking to this person. That means that this is a new individual.” 

Orpheus: “there are flickers of Eurydice in her.” 

Coyote: “but it’s not her.” 

Orpheus: “dripping off of her like myr oozing from a blessed icon.” 

Coyote: “you’re not listening to me” 

Orpheus: “I just don’t care. I’m okay with all of this.” 

Coyote: “how can you be okay with this?”

Orpheus: “you’ve never stopped me” 

Coyote: “no.”

1jbsdl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1jbsdl2/my_testimony/,My Testimony,"God's really been looking out for my family and me, giving us so many second chances over the years. I just hope we don't waste them. Everything I've written about has happened to us, and no doubt there's even more that I can't remember. These amazing moments are listed in order, covering five decades from 1975 to 2025. I honestly believe that God takes care of us because I've felt it firsthand. Sure, a lot has happened to us, but when you think about it, fifty years is a long time in anyone's life or a family's journey.

When I was a teenager, my family had a swimming pool. One summer day in 1975, I was swimming alone and decided to dive in but dived a bit too deep for the pool’s depth. My chin hit the bottom with a loud click. It was scary to think my life could have ended right there, floating, or sinking in the pool, especially since I was alone. If I had been paralysed, I wouldn't have been able to get out.

Around the end of Year 10 in 1975, my parents arranged for me to transfer to a new school to study Music, since my current school didn't offer it in Years 11 and 12. Even though I was outside the catchment area, I got into the new school. It was a relief because I was bullied in junior high, but that stopped at the new school. I got to study Music and avoid the bullies. It felt like everything fell into place, even though I wasn't in the catchment area.

When I worked my butt off to get through Years 11 and 12, I scored high enough on my Higher School Certificate to get into Macquarie University, study History, and earn a Bachelor of Arts. Uni was a bit of a challenge at times, but I made it through and graduated.

I met Jackie at this Christian Youth Group called Young Life, and we started dating back in the winter of 1979. My mum, after just a couple of weeks, told me I should let Jackie know how I felt about her. So, one night a week later, I did just that. We went from being boyfriend and girlfriend to steady to engaged, all in one night, as I proposed to her. She said ""Yes,"" and I didn't even have a ring. I hadn't planned to propose that night; it just happened. I'd known Jackie for less than six weeks at the time. My mum encouraged me to follow my heart, not my head, 'cause Jackie had already captured my heart, and she still has it. Mums just know who's right for their kids.

When my mum showed me an ad for a government job, I had just finished uni and was about to get married in less than two months. I landed the job, and even asked for leave without pay for my honeymoon during the interview. I ended up staying in that job for over eighteen years, and everything worked out fine once I started working and took time off for my honeymoon.

We got married on December 5, 1981, and the very next day, we kicked off our honeymoon. As we headed to Forster, cruising north on the freeway from Hornsby, a woman in the lane next to us had a trailer. She flicked on her blinker and started merging into our lane, but we were in her blind spot. I tried to move over and slow down to give her room, but we were all moving at highway speeds, and she kept inching into my lane. I laid on the horn, and she finally noticed us just as I was about to hit the traffic safety barriers with a ditch on the side of the road. She quickly moved back into her lane. Talk about a wild start to married life!

When we were newlyweds renting a unit in West Ryde, we got hit with a bill we couldn't pay. But then, it was amazing, a cheque showed up in the mail the day after we got that bill. It was just a couple of dollars short of the bill, but enough to get it paid. We had no idea the cheque was coming, but it saved the day!

When we rented that unit, we asked if we could put a deadbolt on the door. The real estate agent agreed, if we gave them a set of keys and left the lock on the door when we moved out. A couple of months later, all the units in the block got burgled, except for ours and one other. Out of twelve units, ten got hit, but the two that didn't both had deadbolts. One of those was ours. The other units didn't have deadlocks, just the same easy-to-break-into locks.

When we had our first car, a green Holden HQ Kingswood sedan, someone stole it from the unit car park. Luckily, it was found later that day in Eastern Creek, though it was totalled. The police found the car without us having to wait months for the insurance company to decide about the payout if the car hadn't been found.

We were renting in West Ryde, and it was getting time to renew the lease or move out. We hadn't decided yet, but then my parents told us they were off on a four-month overseas holiday. So, the decision was made for us—they asked us to housesit. We didn't have much furniture, and they had a big downstairs room we could stay in, with a toilet and shower next to it. They prepaid all their bills, so we didn't have any to worry about. We got a place to live rent-free while they were away and for a couple of months after they returned.

When we moved out of my parents' place, we rented a unit in Meadowbank for a year. During that time, and while living with my parents before, we saved up enough to put a deposit on another unit in Meadowbank. We paid off a small personal loan and bought the unit, leaving the rental market behind and stepping into homeownership with a mortgage.

After being married for six years, our parents started asking when we'd have kids. We hadn't really thought about it since we were busy with work, vacations, and often looking after my younger sibling, Chris. But then we decided to try for a baby. Surprisingly, after just six weeks, Jackie got pregnant, even after being on the pill for eight years, and carried Michelle to full term. Michelle was born with the help of forceps because she wasn't positioned correctly, but thanks to the doctor's skill, everything went smoothly.

Before Michelle was born, we realised how tough it would be to raise a baby in a top-floor unit without a laundry, especially since disposable nappies weren't a thing yet. So, we decided to sell the unit and buy a house. Wow, the unit sold the day we listed it, and we started house hunting. We found a house just in time and moved in before Michelle was born. It felt like there was planning that we found a buyer so quickly and a house at just the right moment, allowing us to move into our new home on the same day the unit sale was finalised.

When we were shopping at Blacktown Westpoint with Michelle, who was just a year old, we had a trolley, a pram, and a package to manage while getting out of the lift. We pushed the pram out first, and then Jackie and I went back in to grab the rest. Suddenly, the lift doors closed on us, and it started moving up, leaving Michelle alone in her pram on the floor we just left. We rushed back down after the lift stopped on another floor and found Michelle surrounded by a bunch of sweet elderly ladies, all wondering where her parents were. Thankfully, Michelle wasn't alone for long and was safe with the ladies keeping an eye on her.

Then there was this time I hit a semi-trailer. The car was totalled because the whole front, from both front doors to the bumper, was crushed. I lost control on a wet road and slid across three lanes, unintentionally aiming for a telegraph pole. Instead, we hit the truck, and the impact pushed us back into our original lane, sparing us from wrapping around the pole. The car was written off by insurance. I was fine, but Jackie got whiplash, which she recovered from, and our two-year-old Michelle ended up with a buckle imprint from her car seat on her stomach. The insurance company replaced her car seat, and she was okay.

Years after the accident, we had another child, Marcus. If we hadn't survived that crash, Marcus wouldn't be here today. It's amazing to think about how everything worked out, with the truck being there stopping us from a worse disaster, and now we have Marcus in our lives. When we were trying for that second kid, months went by, and we started losing hope, thinking it might never happen. We stopped actively trying, and then, surprise! Jackie got pregnant after we had given up. That's how we ended up with our second child.

When our youngest, Marcus, was three, Jackie was doing housework and was home alone with him. She suddenly heard a voice in the room telling her to check on Marcus. No one else was there, but she listened to the voice. She went outside and found Marcus on the road! She quickly brought him back inside, keeping him safe from any cars.

Another time, we were on holiday in Dubbo and visiting a big op shop. Our four-year-old, Marcus, wandered off like he usually does, but this time, he actually left the store without us knowing. My wife, daughter, and I searched for him inside but couldn't find him. We left the store and randomly turned left, not really knowing where he went. Luckily, we came across a couple, and the man was holding Marcus up in his arms. He told us he saw Marcus crossing the road alone and thought something was off since there were no parents around. So, he picked Marcus up and backtracked to find us. We were so relieved to be reunited with our son!

When we were on holiday, driving back from Melbourne to Sydney, our kids were young. We stopped at a roadside rest stop with a toilet. Our older kid, Michelle, wanted to go, so off she went by herself. To my horror, I realised it was a pit toilet. I told my wife, Jackie, to run after her. Jackie got there just in time and managed to save Michelle from falling into the pit below the toilet seat. Luckily, Michelle had left the door open, so Jackie could grab her before she disappeared into the pit. It was a narrow escape!

When we were super broke, all we could afford to eat were sausages and mashed potatoes for weeks. Jackie talked to some folks at the church we were attending and mentioned how hard things were financially. Someone, and we never found out who, put an envelope with our name on it in the offering tray. It had $100 in it, which was a big deal back in the nineties. One of the church elders gave us the envelope, and it came at a time when we were really struggling.

Later, we left that church because Marcus, our kid with special needs, was a bit too much for them. He was the only special needs child there and had some behavioural issues. We found another church where Marcus was accepted for who he is. Jackie and I even went through adult baptism there. It was a place where Marcus and we felt welcome and could acknowledge our faith.

My workplace offered a voluntary redundancy package, and I decided to take it. It turned out to be a great financial decision! We managed to pay off the mortgage and credit cards and even did some renovations. After that, I became a student and studied IT, web design, and networking. Then, I've launched my own website business, and it's just me running the show!

Back in mid-1999, after dealing with chest pain for what felt like forever, my wife finally convinced me to see a doctor. Turns out, my thyroid had gone rogue and was squishing everything in its path, including my windpipe and oesophagus. If it weren’t for my wife’s insistence, things could’ve ended badly once my windpipe closed up. Surgery was a narrow escape, too; the doctor thought they might have to crack open my ribcage, to get at the thyroid from below as it was in my chest, but luckily, they managed to remove the thyroid through my neck, hiding the scar pretty well.

While waiting for the biopsy results at work, before the operation my wife Jackie called to say, ""There's no cancer."" At that moment, I swear I felt two hands on my shoulders, but when I turned around, no one was there. It was a surreal experience, feeling a touch when there wasn’t anyone there.

When I was on holiday with my family in Melbourne, we got lost and parked on the side of the road. Out of nowhere, a truck came over the hill and hit our car. Fortunately, the only damage was to the driver's mirror. It could've been way worse if the truck had been a bit closer. We were fortunate it wasn't a bad accident. During the same holiday, we took a bus while our car was getting the mirror fixed. We were having a tough time calming Marcus down, and this kind lady came over and prayed for us. It was just what we needed. She said God told her to pray for us, so she did.

When I saw a cat on TV twitching and moving around in its sleep, it was so active it actually fell off the coffee table it was lying on. The commentator said the cat had REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder, and I was like, “Hey, that’s me!” I've been having dreams where I get super active and end up falling out of bed while still asleep. After this happened a few times, I decided to hit up the hospital and see a sleep specialist. They did a sleep study and, surprise, I got diagnosed with REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder. The sleep doc started talking about Parkinson’s Disease and my short-term memory issues, which was a bit of a wake-up call. You see, I had stumbled onto a TV program while channel surfing, and it made me connect the dots between my sleep habits and the cat's leading to my diagnosis.

Then there was this time when I had a nagging shoulder ache for ages, but I didn’t see a doctor 'cause, you know, I thought it’d just go away. Anyway, our church had a visiting healer for the first time, so I went up, sat in the chair, and didn’t even mention my shoulder. The healer didn’t ask either. They put some holy oil on my forehead, prayed over me, and laid hands on me. When I went back to my seat, I felt this burning hot circle right where my shoulder hurt. After a bit, the burning sensation faded, and I realised my shoulder pain was gone and never came back.

When my wife, Jackie, had a series of mini strokes which were TIA’s when she was 35, we already had two kids. The doctors said Jackie had to stop taking the pill immediately, and that I should get a vasectomy because a tubal ligation would be too risky for Jackie. Another pregnancy or childbirth could be life-threatening for her. So, I went ahead with the vasectomy, and we also went through counselling. The main thing was keeping Jackie safe and healthy. We made the right call with me getting the vasectomy. This way, Jackie is still with us, and I didn’t have to face raising our kids alone.

Jackie stumbled upon a job opportunity back in 2002 which was on the special needs school bus run with Marcus, and even though she wasn't actively looking, she embraced it wholeheartedly. She quickly became the caring presence in the back of the bus, looking after the kids. Jackie absolutely loves her role, and after working with several schools, she's finally found one where she's genuinely happy. Over the past 23 years, Jackie has been the dedicated carer on various school buses, and she has no plans of slowing down anytime soon!

When my eldest kid, Michelle, was getting bullied in high school, Jackie and I decided to pull her out of that school system. We reached out to another school, even though we weren't in their catchment area. They accepted her, and she settled in nicely. The bullying stopped, and she made some solid friendships. Later on, one of the bullies from her old school joined her new one, but by then, Michelle had a strong group of friends who stood up for her, and the bullying was quickly shut down.

When our church closed because it wasn't viable, we found a new one where we all felt at home. Marcus, who has special needs, was warmly welcomed there. The congregation had been hoping for someone like Marcus to join, and he fit right in with us. It was a perfect match for our whole family.

I often enter competitions to win, this one was for $1,000, and the community organisation I choose can win $10,000. I prayed about it and nominated our new church. I entered over thirty times and ended up winning the $1,000, while our church got the $10,000. The timing was perfect, especially during the Global Financial Crisis, and it was a huge help for both us and the church.

When Marcus was in Year 11, his high school tried to get him to sign out and leave for good, without coming back for Year 12. That would've been a bad move since the community program he was supposed to join was meant for folks who finished Year 12, not Year 11. Luckily, he found a spot at a special needs school for Year 12, which turned out to be his best school year ever. The new school was just right for him.

We renewed our wedding vows on our 30th anniversary in front of our church community. This time, unlike our wedding day, I got to kiss my wife, which I didn't get to do during our original ceremony. It was a beautiful way to show our commitment to each other by renewing such an important vow.

Once, Marcus and I got on a packed train, and I almost lost my grip on him while pulling him into the carriage. I could've left him behind. Thankfully, we stuck together because if Marcus had been left alone on the platform, I have no idea what might've happened.

During a crazy thunderstorm, when the wind and rain were coming down hard, the eucalyptus tree in our backyard next to the back fence toppled over and landed on our house. It was a total widow-maker. I was in the bathroom under the tree and stayed safe, and Marcus was in the kitchen, also safe. Most of the tree's weight was in the trunk, which landed in the backyard, but a bunch of branches ended up on the house, reaching all the way to the front main bedroom.

When I first noticed some weird symptoms, I had no clue what was going on. So, I went to see a neurologist. They told me I have Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. Now that I know what's up, I can get the help and treatment I need. My symptoms finally make sense, and the type of Mild Cognitive Impairment I have only messes with my short-term memory and some thinking skills, not my long-term memory. Getting diagnosed made me realise what the sleep specialist had talked about years ago actually came true—I ended up with Parkinson’s Disease.

I was driving at 50 km/h when I went through an intersection with a stop sign, I didn't notice. I didn't realise it was an intersection until I heard another car honking like crazy. I should've stopped for them since they had the right of way. I glanced out my window and saw their car getting closer. We both swerved, but luckily, we didn't crash. I turned the wheel hard left, then right, to give us more space, and we missed both the car and a telegraph pole. The other driver stopped and talked to us, mentioning she had her mom and kid in the car. I had my wife and kid with me too. If we had collided, it could've been really bad for both families. But thankfully, we avoided it.

After that scare, I decided to stop driving once I got home. My neurologist and GP also told me to quit driving, and I know they're right. I've already stopped because I know I'm not safe on the road. I'm grateful we made the right call to stop. I’ve come to terms with the fact that my driving days are over, and I’m okay with it.

When I finally got into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) on my third try, it felt like the universe was telling me, ""Hang in there."" Now, I can finally get the support I need for my Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. It all happened at the perfect time, just when I was ready for it.

After being diagnosed with Parkinson’s and Mild Cognitive Impairment, my wife and I realised that as my condition worsened, it would be tough for her to take care of both me and Marcus, with his special needs. So, we decided to find Marcus a spot in a supported independent living share house. He loves it there, and it gives us peace of mind knowing he'll be taken care of both now and in the future.

I had a rough patch when I ended up in the hospital with Septic Shock from a nasty bacterial infection. It was from a bacterium called Proteus mirabilis, which I picked up from gardening. I got blood poisoning, ended up on life support, and was in a coma for three days. My heart was enlarged, my kidneys shut down, and I had a kidney stone blocking one of my ureters. Both my lungs got infected resulting in double pneumonia, and I was on dialysis. I was pretty out of it, with delirium that stuck around even after I woke up from the coma. I was contagious, so I spent ten days in isolation in the ICU. Visitors had to wear disposable gear to see me, and it all had to be tossed when they left.

After my time in the ICU, I was moved to the general ward. Made it through without losing any limbs to sepsis, which is a relief since many people with sepsis end up needing amputations. Sepsis can be deadly, with about five thousand people in Australia dying from it each year. I managed to shake off the delirium, though I still remember some of the wild thoughts I had during that time. My wife, was there every single day of those sixteen days I spent in the hospital, catching four buses daily just to be by my side.

Before they diagnosed me with blood poisoning and sepsis, I was in a lot of pain. I had gone to the hospital earlier that week, where they took some blood and managed to culture it. This meant they could pinpoint the exact bacteria causing the infection and treat it effectively without resorting to broad-spectrum drugs. They emphasised how crucial it was for me to return for treatment, and I was in surgery that very night.

During a routine skin cancer check, the specialist found a basal cell carcinoma on my nose that I hadn't noticed. Thankfully, he was able to remove it all. If left untreated, it could have led to more serious facial surgery and reconstruction. Luckily, I didn't need any complicated procedures since they caught it in time.

I went on a cruise with my dad, just the two of us, on the Majestic Princess from Sydney to Tasmania and back. We had a suite, and it was just before COVID-19 hit. Dad was still able to get around, even in his eighties, and we had such a wonderful time together. It was special to have that time with him before he passed away a couple of years later.

During the COVID era, when I visited him in the hospital, I was his only allowed visitor. On my way back to the train station, I rushed across a road even though the ‘Don't Walk’ sign was flashing. I shouldn't have crossed, and I ended up falling right in front of a bus. I'm not sure if the driver saw me fall, but fortunately, I managed to get up and hobble away with just a hurt elbow and a shoe that had fallen off. Thankfully, the red arrow for the bus stayed red while I was on the crossing. If it had changed, the bus could've started moving over me. A woman on the other side of the road called out to make sure I was okay.

So, one day on another bus ride home, I was juggling two shopping bags in each hand. I couldn't hold onto the seat next to me or the hand straps from the ceiling because I didn't think to put the bags down, plus there wasn't really any space on the bus to do so. As the bus pulled away from the stop, I lost my balance and started falling toward a mom and her pram with two babies. I was in free fall and couldn't stop myself. Luckily, a person sitting behind me grabbed me by my belt and shoulder, pulling me upright just in time before I landed on the mom and her babies. I'm not exactly light since I'm on the heavier side, but they somehow found the strength and space to help me out. After that, someone offered me their seat, which was nice.

After my dad, Bruce, passed away, we had a funeral for him. Not long after, we went to clear out his unit since Mom had passed away a few years before. I discovered that Dad had kept a bunch of birthday, Christmas, and Father's Day cards we gave him as kids, tucked away in his bedside cabinet. I also started wearing his wedding ring from the day he passed. It was surprising to see how sentimental he was; I never expected him to be so sappy.

When Marcus, decided to leave his group home without telling the staff, he hopped on a bus from Baulkham Hills to Rouse Hill all by himself. We were on holiday in Hobart, and the police called us. After that, we used his Opal card to track his movements since Marcus knows how to tap on and off. Opal helped us figure out where he went, so we contacted the police and the house staff with the info. The police found him at Rouse Hill Shopping Centre, hearing him before seeing him because he was talking loudly to himself. They turned a corner, and there he was. Rouse Hill Shops is spread over a large area, not your typical mall. Marcus was safe and found by the police and staff.

A couple of years after my dad passed away, my wife, Jackie, accidentally stepped on an old answering machine we didn’t use anymore since we switched to NBN and don't need a home phone. It started playing a message from my late dad, recorded when he was alive. We didn’t know it was there. In the message, Dad tells me not to worry and that he loves me. I realised I was meant to hear it when I needed to, so I recorded it on my computer. Now, I can listen to Dad whenever I want, though it reminds me of how much I miss him and sometimes makes me emotional. It’s been four years since he passed, but I’m not deleting the recording because it’s a piece of him. It hurts knowing that after Mom died, none of us, not even my siblings or I, could keep him going. He just wanted to be with Mom and stopped eating. Now they’re together. I found the message when I needed it, and Dad’s words are helping me through the grieving process.

When Jackie passed out and went into a diabetic coma last Mother’s Day at Featherdale Wildlife Park, the 000 operator was super attentive. The first aid crew at Featherdale took care of Jackie while we waited for the ambulance. By the time the ambulance arrived, Jackie was out of the coma, but they took her to the hospital for observation and admitted her. After this scare, Jackie got serious about checking her sugar levels and managing her diabetes better. It was a real wake-up call for her.

A few weeks ago, a stray cat showed up at our doorstep without a collar or microchip. Jackie named him Max, and we've all fallen head over heels for him. It's been great having another cat to care for and share our home with, and Max has become a part of our family. He needs prayer though, for a good life as we’ve found out he has Feline Aids. He didn’t ask for that. If anything, it makes me love him more. Fortunately, the Feline Aids cannot be transferred to humans, so we're safe if he scratches or bites us.

This year, I've started using support workers to help me get to medical appointments and join in on social activities. It's a big change for me since I used to spend most of my time at home alone. Now, I'm getting out more and meeting new people.

Through everything that's happened to me and my family, I've always felt that God has been there for us, both in the good times and the tough ones. We've felt protected in so many ways—mentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially, and even on the road during dangerous times. It's like God's always been there, especially when things could've gone really wrong. I don't think it's just luck; it feels like it's all been part of a plan. I'm also incredibly grateful for my wife, Jackie, who's always been there for me and our kids. I truly thank God for bringing us together.

For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11.

Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you. Deuteronomy 31:6.

Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10.

God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Psalm 46:1.

And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28.

For you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. Psalm 63:7.

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Psalm 23:4.

Bible readings are from the NIV.

We serve an Awesome God.

We have an Awesome God.

Give all the Glory to God.

1jbscyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1jbscyq/my_testimony/,My Testimony,"God's really been looking out for my family and me, giving us so many second chances over the years. I just hope we don't waste them. Everything I've written about has happened to us, and no doubt there's even more that I can't remember. These amazing moments are listed in order, covering five decades from 1975 to 2025. I honestly believe that God takes care of us because I've felt it firsthand. Sure, a lot has happened to us, but when you think about it, fifty years is a long time in anyone's life or a family's journey.

When I was a teenager, my family had a swimming pool. One summer day in 1975, I was swimming alone and decided to dive in but dived a bit too deep for the pool’s depth. My chin hit the bottom with a loud click. It was scary to think my life could have ended right there, floating, or sinking in the pool, especially since I was alone. If I had been paralysed, I wouldn't have been able to get out.

Around the end of Year 10 in 1975, my parents arranged for me to transfer to a new school to study Music, since my current school didn't offer it in Years 11 and 12. Even though I was outside the catchment area, I got into the new school. It was a relief because I was bullied in junior high, but that stopped at the new school. I got to study Music and avoid the bullies. It felt like everything fell into place, even though I wasn't in the catchment area.

When I worked my butt off to get through Years 11 and 12, I scored high enough on my Higher School Certificate to get into Macquarie University, study History, and earn a Bachelor of Arts. Uni was a bit of a challenge at times, but I made it through and graduated.

I met Jackie at this Christian Youth Group called Young Life, and we started dating back in the winter of 1979. My mum, after just a couple of weeks, told me I should let Jackie know how I felt about her. So, one night a week later, I did just that. We went from being boyfriend and girlfriend to steady to engaged, all in one night, as I proposed to her. She said ""Yes,"" and I didn't even have a ring. I hadn't planned to propose that night; it just happened. I'd known Jackie for less than six weeks at the time. My mum encouraged me to follow my heart, not my head, 'cause Jackie had already captured my heart, and she still has it. Mums just know who's right for their kids.

When my mum showed me an ad for a government job, I had just finished uni and was about to get married in less than two months. I landed the job, and even asked for leave without pay for my honeymoon during the interview. I ended up staying in that job for over eighteen years, and everything worked out fine once I started working and took time off for my honeymoon.

We got married on December 5, 1981, and the very next day, we kicked off our honeymoon. As we headed to Forster, cruising north on the freeway from Hornsby, a woman in the lane next to us had a trailer. She flicked on her blinker and started merging into our lane, but we were in her blind spot. I tried to move over and slow down to give her room, but we were all moving at highway speeds, and she kept inching into my lane. I laid on the horn, and she finally noticed us just as I was about to hit the traffic safety barriers with a ditch on the side of the road. She quickly moved back into her lane. Talk about a wild start to married life!

When we were newlyweds renting a unit in West Ryde, we got hit with a bill we couldn't pay. But then, it was amazing, a cheque showed up in the mail the day after we got that bill. It was just a couple of dollars short of the bill, but enough to get it paid. We had no idea the cheque was coming, but it saved the day!

When we rented that unit, we asked if we could put a deadbolt on the door. The real estate agent agreed, if we gave them a set of keys and left the lock on the door when we moved out. A couple of months later, all the units in the block got burgled, except for ours and one other. Out of twelve units, ten got hit, but the two that didn't both had deadbolts. One of those was ours. The other units didn't have deadlocks, just the same easy-to-break-into locks.

When we had our first car, a green Holden HQ Kingswood sedan, someone stole it from the unit car park. Luckily, it was found later that day in Eastern Creek, though it was totalled. The police found the car without us having to wait months for the insurance company to decide about the payout if the car hadn't been found.

We were renting in West Ryde, and it was getting time to renew the lease or move out. We hadn't decided yet, but then my parents told us they were off on a four-month overseas holiday. So, the decision was made for us—they asked us to housesit. We didn't have much furniture, and they had a big downstairs room we could stay in, with a toilet and shower next to it. They prepaid all their bills, so we didn't have any to worry about. We got a place to live rent-free while they were away and for a couple of months after they returned.

When we moved out of my parents' place, we rented a unit in Meadowbank for a year. During that time, and while living with my parents before, we saved up enough to put a deposit on another unit in Meadowbank. We paid off a small personal loan and bought the unit, leaving the rental market behind and stepping into homeownership with a mortgage.

After being married for six years, our parents started asking when we'd have kids. We hadn't really thought about it since we were busy with work, vacations, and often looking after my younger sibling, Chris. But then we decided to try for a baby. Surprisingly, after just six weeks, Jackie got pregnant, even after being on the pill for eight years, and carried Michelle to full term. Michelle was born with the help of forceps because she wasn't positioned correctly, but thanks to the doctor's skill, everything went smoothly.

Before Michelle was born, we realised how tough it would be to raise a baby in a top-floor unit without a laundry, especially since disposable nappies weren't a thing yet. So, we decided to sell the unit and buy a house. Wow, the unit sold the day we listed it, and we started house hunting. We found a house just in time and moved in before Michelle was born. It felt like there was planning that we found a buyer so quickly and a house at just the right moment, allowing us to move into our new home on the same day the unit sale was finalised.

When we were shopping at Blacktown Westpoint with Michelle, who was just a year old, we had a trolley, a pram, and a package to manage while getting out of the lift. We pushed the pram out first, and then Jackie and I went back in to grab the rest. Suddenly, the lift doors closed on us, and it started moving up, leaving Michelle alone in her pram on the floor we just left. We rushed back down after the lift stopped on another floor and found Michelle surrounded by a bunch of sweet elderly ladies, all wondering where her parents were. Thankfully, Michelle wasn't alone for long and was safe with the ladies keeping an eye on her.

Then there was this time I hit a semi-trailer. The car was totalled because the whole front, from both front doors to the bumper, was crushed. I lost control on a wet road and slid across three lanes, unintentionally aiming for a telegraph pole. Instead, we hit the truck, and the impact pushed us back into our original lane, sparing us from wrapping around the pole. The car was written off by insurance. I was fine, but Jackie got whiplash, which she recovered from, and our two-year-old Michelle ended up with a buckle imprint from her car seat on her stomach. The insurance company replaced her car seat, and she was okay.

Years after the accident, we had another child, Marcus. If we hadn't survived that crash, Marcus wouldn't be here today. It's amazing to think about how everything worked out, with the truck being there stopping us from a worse disaster, and now we have Marcus in our lives. When we were trying for that second kid, months went by, and we started losing hope, thinking it might never happen. We stopped actively trying, and then, surprise! Jackie got pregnant after we had given up. That's how we ended up with our second child.

When our youngest, Marcus, was three, Jackie was doing housework and was home alone with him. She suddenly heard a voice in the room telling her to check on Marcus. No one else was there, but she listened to the voice. She went outside and found Marcus on the road! She quickly brought him back inside, keeping him safe from any cars.

Another time, we were on holiday in Dubbo and visiting a big op shop. Our four-year-old, Marcus, wandered off like he usually does, but this time, he actually left the store without us knowing. My wife, daughter, and I searched for him inside but couldn't find him. We left the store and randomly turned left, not really knowing where he went. Luckily, we came across a couple, and the man was holding Marcus up in his arms. He told us he saw Marcus crossing the road alone and thought something was off since there were no parents around. So, he picked Marcus up and backtracked to find us. We were so relieved to be reunited with our son!

When we were on holiday, driving back from Melbourne to Sydney, our kids were young. We stopped at a roadside rest stop with a toilet. Our older kid, Michelle, wanted to go, so off she went by herself. To my horror, I realised it was a pit toilet. I told my wife, Jackie, to run after her. Jackie got there just in time and managed to save Michelle from falling into the pit below the toilet seat. Luckily, Michelle had left the door open, so Jackie could grab her before she disappeared into the pit. It was a narrow escape!

When we were super broke, all we could afford to eat were sausages and mashed potatoes for weeks. Jackie talked to some folks at the church we were attending and mentioned how hard things were financially. Someone, and we never found out who, put an envelope with our name on it in the offering tray. It had $100 in it, which was a big deal back in the nineties. One of the church elders gave us the envelope, and it came at a time when we were really struggling.

Later, we left that church because Marcus, our kid with special needs, was a bit too much for them. He was the only special needs child there and had some behavioural issues. We found another church where Marcus was accepted for who he is. Jackie and I even went through adult baptism there. It was a place where Marcus and we felt welcome and could acknowledge our faith.

My workplace offered a voluntary redundancy package, and I decided to take it. It turned out to be a great financial decision! We managed to pay off the mortgage and credit cards and even did some renovations. After that, I became a student and studied IT, web design, and networking. Then, I've launched my own website business, and it's just me running the show!

Back in mid-1999, after dealing with chest pain for what felt like forever, my wife finally convinced me to see a doctor. Turns out, my thyroid had gone rogue and was squishing everything in its path, including my windpipe and oesophagus. If it weren’t for my wife’s insistence, things could’ve ended badly once my windpipe closed up. Surgery was a narrow escape, too; the doctor thought they might have to crack open my ribcage, to get at the thyroid from below as it was in my chest, but luckily, they managed to remove the thyroid through my neck, hiding the scar pretty well.

While waiting for the biopsy results at work, before the operation my wife Jackie called to say, ""There's no cancer."" At that moment, I swear I felt two hands on my shoulders, but when I turned around, no one was there. It was a surreal experience, feeling a touch when there wasn’t anyone there.

When I was on holiday with my family in Melbourne, we got lost and parked on the side of the road. Out of nowhere, a truck came over the hill and hit our car. Fortunately, the only damage was to the driver's mirror. It could've been way worse if the truck had been a bit closer. We were fortunate it wasn't a bad accident. During the same holiday, we took a bus while our car was getting the mirror fixed. We were having a tough time calming Marcus down, and this kind lady came over and prayed for us. It was just what we needed. She said God told her to pray for us, so she did.

When I saw a cat on TV twitching and moving around in its sleep, it was so active it actually fell off the coffee table it was lying on. The commentator said the cat had REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder, and I was like, “Hey, that’s me!” I've been having dreams where I get super active and end up falling out of bed while still asleep. After this happened a few times, I decided to hit up the hospital and see a sleep specialist. They did a sleep study and, surprise, I got diagnosed with REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder. The sleep doc started talking about Parkinson’s Disease and my short-term memory issues, which was a bit of a wake-up call. You see, I had stumbled onto a TV program while channel surfing, and it made me connect the dots between my sleep habits and the cat's leading to my diagnosis.

Then there was this time when I had a nagging shoulder ache for ages, but I didn’t see a doctor 'cause, you know, I thought it’d just go away. Anyway, our church had a visiting healer for the first time, so I went up, sat in the chair, and didn’t even mention my shoulder. The healer didn’t ask either. They put some holy oil on my forehead, prayed over me, and laid hands on me. When I went back to my seat, I felt this burning hot circle right where my shoulder hurt. After a bit, the burning sensation faded, and I realised my shoulder pain was gone and never came back.

When my wife, Jackie, had a series of mini strokes which were TIA’s when she was 35, we already had two kids. The doctors said Jackie had to stop taking the pill immediately, and that I should get a vasectomy because a tubal ligation would be too risky for Jackie. Another pregnancy or childbirth could be life-threatening for her. So, I went ahead with the vasectomy, and we also went through counselling. The main thing was keeping Jackie safe and healthy. We made the right call with me getting the vasectomy. This way, Jackie is still with us, and I didn’t have to face raising our kids alone.

Jackie stumbled upon a job opportunity back in 2002 which was on the special needs school bus run with Marcus, and even though she wasn't actively looking, she embraced it wholeheartedly. She quickly became the caring presence in the back of the bus, looking after the kids. Jackie absolutely loves her role, and after working with several schools, she's finally found one where she's genuinely happy. Over the past 23 years, Jackie has been the dedicated carer on various school buses, and she has no plans of slowing down anytime soon!

When my eldest kid, Michelle, was getting bullied in high school, Jackie and I decided to pull her out of that school system. We reached out to another school, even though we weren't in their catchment area. They accepted her, and she settled in nicely. The bullying stopped, and she made some solid friendships. Later on, one of the bullies from her old school joined her new one, but by then, Michelle had a strong group of friends who stood up for her, and the bullying was quickly shut down.

When our church closed because it wasn't viable, we found a new one where we all felt at home. Marcus, who has special needs, was warmly welcomed there. The congregation had been hoping for someone like Marcus to join, and he fit right in with us. It was a perfect match for our whole family.

I often enter competitions to win, this one was for $1,000, and the community organisation I choose can win $10,000. I prayed about it and nominated our new church. I entered over thirty times and ended up winning the $1,000, while our church got the $10,000. The timing was perfect, especially during the Global Financial Crisis, and it was a huge help for both us and the church.

When Marcus was in Year 11, his high school tried to get him to sign out and leave for good, without coming back for Year 12. That would've been a bad move since the community program he was supposed to join was meant for folks who finished Year 12, not Year 11. Luckily, he found a spot at a special needs school for Year 12, which turned out to be his best school year ever. The new school was just right for him.

We renewed our wedding vows on our 30th anniversary in front of our church community. This time, unlike our wedding day, I got to kiss my wife, which I didn't get to do during our original ceremony. It was a beautiful way to show our commitment to each other by renewing such an important vow.

Once, Marcus and I got on a packed train, and I almost lost my grip on him while pulling him into the carriage. I could've left him behind. Thankfully, we stuck together because if Marcus had been left alone on the platform, I have no idea what might've happened.

During a crazy thunderstorm, when the wind and rain were coming down hard, the eucalyptus tree in our backyard next to the back fence toppled over and landed on our house. It was a total widow-maker. I was in the bathroom under the tree and stayed safe, and Marcus was in the kitchen, also safe. Most of the tree's weight was in the trunk, which landed in the backyard, but a bunch of branches ended up on the house, reaching all the way to the front main bedroom.

When I first noticed some weird symptoms, I had no clue what was going on. So, I went to see a neurologist. They told me I have Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. Now that I know what's up, I can get the help and treatment I need. My symptoms finally make sense, and the type of Mild Cognitive Impairment I have only messes with my short-term memory and some thinking skills, not my long-term memory. Getting diagnosed made me realise what the sleep specialist had talked about years ago actually came true—I ended up with Parkinson’s Disease.

I was driving at 50 km/h when I went through an intersection with a stop sign, I didn't notice. I didn't realise it was an intersection until I heard another car honking like crazy. I should've stopped for them since they had the right of way. I glanced out my window and saw their car getting closer. We both swerved, but luckily, we didn't crash. I turned the wheel hard left, then right, to give us more space, and we missed both the car and a telegraph pole. The other driver stopped and talked to us, mentioning she had her mom and kid in the car. I had my wife and kid with me too. If we had collided, it could've been really bad for both families. But thankfully, we avoided it.

After that scare, I decided to stop driving once I got home. My neurologist and GP also told me to quit driving, and I know they're right. I've already stopped because I know I'm not safe on the road. I'm grateful we made the right call to stop. I’ve come to terms with the fact that my driving days are over, and I’m okay with it.

When I finally got into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) on my third try, it felt like the universe was telling me, ""Hang in there."" Now, I can finally get the support I need for my Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. It all happened at the perfect time, just when I was ready for it.

After being diagnosed with Parkinson’s and Mild Cognitive Impairment, my wife and I realised that as my condition worsened, it would be tough for her to take care of both me and Marcus, with his special needs. So, we decided to find Marcus a spot in a supported independent living share house. He loves it there, and it gives us peace of mind knowing he'll be taken care of both now and in the future.

I had a rough patch when I ended up in the hospital with Septic Shock from a nasty bacterial infection. It was from a bacterium called Proteus mirabilis, which I picked up from gardening. I got blood poisoning, ended up on life support, and was in a coma for three days. My heart was enlarged, my kidneys shut down, and I had a kidney stone blocking one of my ureters. Both my lungs got infected resulting in double pneumonia, and I was on dialysis. I was pretty out of it, with delirium that stuck around even after I woke up from the coma. I was contagious, so I spent ten days in isolation in the ICU. Visitors had to wear disposable gear to see me, and it all had to be tossed when they left.

After my time in the ICU, I was moved to the general ward. Made it through without losing any limbs to sepsis, which is a relief since many people with sepsis end up needing amputations. Sepsis can be deadly, with about five thousand people in Australia dying from it each year. I managed to shake off the delirium, though I still remember some of the wild thoughts I had during that time. My wife, was there every single day of those sixteen days I spent in the hospital, catching four buses daily just to be by my side.

Before they diagnosed me with blood poisoning and sepsis, I was in a lot of pain. I had gone to the hospital earlier that week, where they took some blood and managed to culture it. This meant they could pinpoint the exact bacteria causing the infection and treat it effectively without resorting to broad-spectrum drugs. They emphasised how crucial it was for me to return for treatment, and I was in surgery that very night.

During a routine skin cancer check, the specialist found a basal cell carcinoma on my nose that I hadn't noticed. Thankfully, he was able to remove it all. If left untreated, it could have led to more serious facial surgery and reconstruction. Luckily, I didn't need any complicated procedures since they caught it in time.

I went on a cruise with my dad, just the two of us, on the Majestic Princess from Sydney to Tasmania and back. We had a suite, and it was just before COVID-19 hit. Dad was still able to get around, even in his eighties, and we had such a wonderful time together. It was special to have that time with him before he passed away a couple of years later.

During the COVID era, when I visited him in the hospital, I was his only allowed visitor. On my way back to the train station, I rushed across a road even though the ‘Don't Walk’ sign was flashing. I shouldn't have crossed, and I ended up falling right in front of a bus. I'm not sure if the driver saw me fall, but fortunately, I managed to get up and hobble away with just a hurt elbow and a shoe that had fallen off. Thankfully, the red arrow for the bus stayed red while I was on the crossing. If it had changed, the bus could've started moving over me. A woman on the other side of the road called out to make sure I was okay.

So, one day on another bus ride home, I was juggling two shopping bags in each hand. I couldn't hold onto the seat next to me or the hand straps from the ceiling because I didn't think to put the bags down, plus there wasn't really any space on the bus to do so. As the bus pulled away from the stop, I lost my balance and started falling toward a mom and her pram with two babies. I was in free fall and couldn't stop myself. Luckily, a person sitting behind me grabbed me by my belt and shoulder, pulling me upright just in time before I landed on the mom and her babies. I'm not exactly light since I'm on the heavier side, but they somehow found the strength and space to help me out. After that, someone offered me their seat, which was nice.

After my dad, Bruce, passed away, we had a funeral for him. Not long after, we went to clear out his unit since Mom had passed away a few years before. I discovered that Dad had kept a bunch of birthday, Christmas, and Father's Day cards we gave him as kids, tucked away in his bedside cabinet. I also started wearing his wedding ring from the day he passed. It was surprising to see how sentimental he was; I never expected him to be so sappy.

When Marcus, decided to leave his group home without telling the staff, he hopped on a bus from Baulkham Hills to Rouse Hill all by himself. We were on holiday in Hobart, and the police called us. After that, we used his Opal card to track his movements since Marcus knows how to tap on and off. Opal helped us figure out where he went, so we contacted the police and the house staff with the info. The police found him at Rouse Hill Shopping Centre, hearing him before seeing him because he was talking loudly to himself. They turned a corner, and there he was. Rouse Hill Shops is spread over a large area, not your typical mall. Marcus was safe and found by the police and staff.

A couple of years after my dad passed away, my wife, Jackie, accidentally stepped on an old answering machine we didn’t use anymore since we switched to NBN and don't need a home phone. It started playing a message from my late dad, recorded when he was alive. We didn’t know it was there. In the message, Dad tells me not to worry and that he loves me. I realised I was meant to hear it when I needed to, so I recorded it on my computer. Now, I can listen to Dad whenever I want, though it reminds me of how much I miss him and sometimes makes me emotional. It’s been four years since he passed, but I’m not deleting the recording because it’s a piece of him. It hurts knowing that after Mom died, none of us, not even my siblings or I, could keep him going. He just wanted to be with Mom and stopped eating. Now they’re together. I found the message when I needed it, and Dad’s words are helping me through the grieving process.

When Jackie passed out and went into a diabetic coma last Mother’s Day at Featherdale Wildlife Park, the 000 operator was super attentive. The first aid crew at Featherdale took care of Jackie while we waited for the ambulance. By the time the ambulance arrived, Jackie was out of the coma, but they took her to the hospital for observation and admitted her. After this scare, Jackie got serious about checking her sugar levels and managing her diabetes better. It was a real wake-up call for her.

A few weeks ago, a stray cat showed up at our doorstep without a collar or microchip. Jackie named him Max, and we've all fallen head over heels for him. It's been great having another cat to care for and share our home with, and Max has become a part of our family. He needs prayer though, for a good life as we’ve found out he has Feline Aids. He didn’t ask for that. If anything, it makes me love him more. Fortunately, the Feline Aids cannot be transferred to humans, so we're safe if he scratches or bites us.

This year, I've started using support workers to help me get to medical appointments and join in on social activities. It's a big change for me since I used to spend most of my time at home alone. Now, I'm getting out more and meeting new people.

Through everything that's happened to me and my family, I've always felt that God has been there for us, both in the good times and the tough ones. We've felt protected in so many ways—mentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially, and even on the road during dangerous times. It's like God's always been there, especially when things could've gone really wrong. I don't think it's just luck; it feels like it's all been part of a plan. I'm also incredibly grateful for my wife, Jackie, who's always been there for me and our kids. I truly thank God for bringing us together.

For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11.

Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you. Deuteronomy 31:6.

Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10.

God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Psalm 46:1.

And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28.

For you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. Psalm 63:7.

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Psalm 23:4.

Bible readings are from the NIV.

We serve an Awesome God.

We have an Awesome God.

Give all the Glory to God.

We started talking for a bit and then decided to meetup for a coffee date and then go back to his apartment, 

He picked me up with his car, and i was stressed ASF because it was my first time ever going out with somebody, he was very chill and i slowly felt safer with him, we got to know each other while we got coffee

Then we went back to his apartment and here things start to get scary, he was asking me suspicious questions and whatever like do you know homosexuality is illegal and whatever, and how old was i when i discovered  i was homosexual etc..

I answered normally and was going with the flow, then we have a little fun in his apartment lol, then when we finish 

He gets up sits on the COUCH and looks at me with a serious face, then proceeds to fucking say  ""I'm a police officer sent from the government to catch gay people and arrest them, and I've sent a message to my team to come and arrest you, they'll be here in a few minutes, plus there where cameras all around the apartment for proof"" 

And here i was shitting my self started crying started dying too, I thought my life was over I was going to be either deported (I'm an expat btw) or even put in jail or even beheaded, I was already thinking of how my future was ruined because I was stupid for even thinking of going out on a date in this homophobic country.

So i started sobbing and begging him that I was not gonna ever do it again, but then he starts laughing and told me ""that was fake don't worry no ones coming and there are no cameras"" I was then silent and shocked while still sobbing, almost jumped on him and chocked him. The relief was so fucking good but the prank was terrible

He then proceeds to told me that he did this with me because he saw that I was young and kinda stupid for going out with anyone this fast 🫠 (ik I'm dumb pls don't shit on me in the comments) so he did this as a way of getting me to come back to reality because some people are dangerous and don't have good intentions etc...

After i calmed he hugged me and told me not to go out with someone again before checking with them really well and to be fair although i was mad, what he did was the RIGHT thing, many cops are on gay dating apps and actively catch people, so I got really really lucky with the guy, he was extremely nice and handsome too 🥴🥴

Then while dropping me off back home, he actually said that he WAS ACTUALLY A POLICE OFFICER AND WORKED IN THE ARMY TOO!!!!!!!!! but he said he's not gonna say anything because he's gay himself. We actually became good friends now and i teach him English while he drives me around hahaha

Tbh now I'm never really going out with anyone again, I'm traumatised

First picture is in its current state. Lounge is about 7 years old now and has been relegated in the new house. Second and third pic are from the old house with our old (now gone) rug, when this was our primary setup. Coffee tables and tv unit are the same. 

Ignore the blinds. They’re being replaced.
Ignore the throw. That’s already gone.

We’ve bought some new navy and mustard throws (not pictured), but they should be considered as part of the overall look.

Cushions are a navy blue and mustard/toffee velvet. Floor tiles are a cream with brown streaks (like skid marks unfortunately).

I’ve been with this firm for about 4 years.  I’ve begun to notice a pattern of boys club behavior in my office but I’m not sure if I’m being overly sensitive or if it’s real.  

I was recently last one to know about a teammates 3rd promotion (we were hired on the same day), this year I was left out of bonus and the conversation around it (we had 3x revenue than previous years), they socialize outside of work, frequently go to lunch together, they have a pattern of waiting till I leave for the day to go out for expensive meals or drinks together (I’m responsible for reconciling these cc charges), they easily banter with each other in front of me and behind closed doors, it goes on and on.  

My reviews are always great and in previous years my bonuses were substantial as was my work load. We’re all about the same age and as much as I get along with each teammate on an individual basis, I can’t figure out why my boss has started to exclude me as part of the team.  Something  switched and the doors started to literally close and I was shut out.  

I have repeatedly asked my boss if I had done something because the shift is palpable and he insists nothings wrong, everything great yet he’s got no time for me anymore, my ideas get pushed to the side, my colleagues are constantly praised in group meetings while my contributions to our revenue stream goes unnoticed, Now I’m fetching coffees and lunches, keeping calendars, being the last to know anything, doing all the simple stuff. and the good ole’ boys club behavior continues. 

So… long story longer, I’m at a loss.  I get paid well, I love doing what I do and I good at it.  I like my female counterparts (we’re scattered across the country, but I don’t trust that venting to them won’t get back to my boss ) and my contributions are valued/recognized  at the corp level. There are no other internal opportunities in my current city, I can’t move to corp HQ.  I don’t feel like complaining to HR will make any difference and might even make things worse for me.

1jbs6mv,https://i.redd.it/ivkw9notytoe1.jpeg,"Hi world, I want to express my happiness for my first decent looking cappuccino","I got so excited before finishing pouring the milk, that I fucked up the bottom of this “heart”.
If you’re reading this, I want to thank you so much for being active in this community.
I come from Italy, I grew up drinking what here’s called “dry cappuccino” and super fast and sour espressos (I am not bragging, trust me). 
I then moved to Poland in my 25, and the cappuccino, coffee in general, was so expensive (to me) that I started using my girlfriend’s machine. 
Now, after a year using that unknown (and bad) coffee machine, last week I bought a Delonghi Stilosa for 450 PLN (105€), and finally a Baratza Encore ESP for 699 PLN (165€~).
I waited so much before doing this investment, I was afraid of wasting money I couldn’t waste. But after a year using a crap machine, a pressurized basket, and an improvised steam wand, damn… i really felt the need of an upgrade, and I can’t really say how nice it feels to be able to control few variables, doing a nice espresso and finally also a SILKY MILKYYY (I have the voice of Lance Hedrick saying this)

I am just starting this journey, but I am so surprised of how this habit became such a satisfying, slow, and enjoyable but mostly useful hobby, since I love coffee and I drink it everyday.
I think Reddit and YouTube have been the best advisors for me, so yeah, I can finally do my best with what I have.

So, cheers everyone. If you’re starting like me, well, have a great journey you too.
And if you’re more experienced, I just want to thank you for making my life easier, and also feel part of a community.

They have a fantastic sweet smell, a lot of honey, sugary dried fruits (figs, dates, raisins) and floral notes too (red rose and rosa canina) but the bouquet of flavours depends from the coffee variety the cherries come from.

You can make an infusion with hot water, different temperatures, with higher temperatures bringing out most of the sweetness and lower temperatures the floral notes, and also a cold brew too.

My starting recipe for the Geisha cascara in the picture is 30gr/L of cascara infused at 94C max for 4 minutes, this is for a lot of sweetness, and you can adjust the temperature to dial in the result.

Not all coffee beans are suitable for this method.**

A moka pot, also known as a stovetop espresso maker, requires specific coffee types to bring out its rich flavor. Freshly roasted, medium to dark roast beans work best. These beans provide a bold and robust taste. It’s important to grind the beans to a medium-fine consistency.

Too fine, and it clogs the filter. Too coarse, and the coffee tastes weak. Always use fresh, filtered water for brewing. This ensures a cleaner taste. Experiment with different beans to find your perfect cup. Enjoy the process. The right coffee makes a huge difference in your daily brew.
