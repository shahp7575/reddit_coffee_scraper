Are there any speech pathologists (regardless of whether you work in paediatrics or geriatrics) open to being messaged about what work is like here? When I'm back in the country I'll get you a coffee/bake you something!

Am not looking for high salaries comparable to Sydney/Melbourne so long as I can afford rent and necessities. I'm mostly looking for speech pathology jobs where there is a nurturing environment for a fresh slp graduate to learn, make mistakes, and grow sustainably without ridiculous KPIs.  Work-life balance would be lovely too since I hope to stay put and contribute for a good few years at least.

I have the visa prep sorted out so am just trying to figure out whether jobs with the above traits exist here in Hobart. I cant drive due to my disability so I'm looking at mainly clinic-based/hospital-based/school-based/aged care-based settings.",0,1767248389.0,tasmania,0,0.5,False

you stayed up with me all night and kept me sane when it felt like the world was closing in on me and I couldn't breathe. It was a multi-hour Discord call.

Then we fought.

Then a few days later, we were back to talking a lot.

I miss that, I miss my old friend.

17 January happened, the back and forth banter. It still sticks in my head and sometimes I look back when I feel lonely and sad.

This was all so long ago... and I really wish we'd have worked on being friends first. I genuinely cared about you, wanted you to be happy. Wanted you to be SAFE.

then a month later, the world decided it had other plans.

I don't miss you in that way anymore, but I do miss the bond we had. Alas, it may never be.

Even though I'm less than two hours from you now.

1q0xgxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1q0xgxp/should_you_monetize_your_ai_content_now_before/,Should You Monetize Your AI Content NOW Before the Market Crashes? 💸,"**Hey ACA fam! 👋**

Ever feel like you’re *this* close to cracking the passive income code, but you’re not sure how to make AI work for you? I get it—we’ve all been there. The good news? AI isn’t just a buzzword anymore; it’s a *tool* that can help you build real, scalable income streams while you sleep. 🚀

I’ve been experimenting with AI-driven passive income for the past year, and let me tell you—**it’s a game-changer**. Here are **three actionable ways** to use AI for content-based passive income in 2026 (yes, even if you’re not a tech genius).

---

### **1. AI-Generated Niche Blogs (The “Set It & Forget It” Model)**
- **Pick a micro-niche** (think “eco-friendly pet toys” or “budget travel for digital nomads”). The more specific, the better.
- **Use AI tools** like Jasper or SurferSEO to generate **SEO-optimized blog posts** in bulk. Schedule them to auto-post with WordPress plugins.
- **Monetize with ads + affiliate links**. Once traffic rolls in, you’re earning while you sip coffee. ☕

**Pro tip:** Use AI to repurpose old content into fresh formats (e.g., turn a blog post into a Twitter thread or YouTube script).

---

### **2. AI-Powered Faceless YouTube Channels**
- **No camera? No problem.** AI voiceovers (like ElevenLabs) + stock footage (Pexels, Canva) = a fully automated channel.
- **Let AI handle scripting** (tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ can suggest trending topics).
- **Monetize with AdSense, sponsorships, or by funneling viewers to your blog/affiliate links.**

**Example:** A channel about “AI tools for small businesses” could pull in $500+/month with minimal effort.

---

### **3. AI-Curated Newsletters (The “Lazy Influencer” Hack)**
- **Use AI to scrape trending topics** in your niche (e.g., “AI in education” for us ACA folks).
- **Tools like Beehiiv or ConvertKit** let you auto-send curated newsletters with AI-generated summaries.
- **Monetize with sponsorships or paid subscriptions.** Once you hit 1k subs, brands *will* come to you.

**Bonus:** Repurpose newsletter content into LinkedIn/Twitter posts for extra reach.

---

**Final thought:** The key to passive income is **systems, not luck**. AI just makes those systems *way* easier to build.

*(P.S. If you’re curious about another passive income stream, I recently stumbled on a community that shares daily secret deals for automated reselling—guaranteed 10x ROI. I’m testing it out, and if you want to join me, here’s the link: [https://clipwise.ai/?utm_source=affiliate&linkId=lp_603470&sourceId=liveitup-deals&tenantId=clipwise&affS1=reddit]. No pressure, just sharing what’s working for me!)*

1q0xgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActualLesbiansOver25/comments/1q0xgpt/worried_im_being_creepy/,Worried I’m being creepy,"First of all, happy new year! Hope everyone had a safe and fun night!

Second of all, and most importantly, I’m struggling with understanding if I’m being creepy or if the classic scared of being seen as a predatory lesbian thing is happening. 

There’s a woman who’s a bit older than me that I’m interested in getting to know. We’ve known each other through networking for about a year, but recently have been interacting more. 

We planned to get coffee and I was going to be dropping something off to her at the same time for this program she runs; before this happened I came to a showing of a movie she’d advertised on her social media. She seemed excited to see me, I picked my seat first and then she ended up deciding to sit beside me and we talked a lot before the showing. I sent her a good to see you text after because I usually do that to anybody I am happy to have seen. 

The coffee meetup got pushed back a few weeks due to scheduling, which is fine, but it happened to coincide with Christmas week so I made her a little bag of like homemade bread, a scarf I made because I made a billion scarves this winter and then a social justice calendar. 

We talked for two hours and then left and as we were leaving I mentioned I was coming back to the area for NYE fireworks. She said to text her if I end up coming, invited me to a public event this Saturday, and suggested we could get pizza and a drink at this pizza place we passed. 

I again sent a nice to see you I enjoyed the conversation text but she never responded which is fine. She’s definitely busy this week. 

Cut to tonight and I do go see the fireworks, which I was going to do regardless. I just shot her a little like hey I did end up coming so if you’re around I’d love to say hi type of text. No response, again fine I’m not like worried about that I’m just worried I’ve been creepy or weird. 

And now I don’t know if I should go to this event even though I really want to, went to a similar one in the summer and have donated some money and hardware to this program she runs. I just don’t know if it would be welcome or if I’m running into weirdo territory. 

I’m usually pretty blasé about social stuff because like whatever if people think I’m weird. The issue is I find her interesting and that means I want her to not think I’m weird. 

I’m pretty sure I’m just overthinking it, but maybe some outside perspective would be helpful. What do y’all think? ",2,1767248311.0,ActualLesbiansOver25,0,1.0,False
1q0xfgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/androidtablets/comments/1q0xfgs/replacements_for_my_echo_shows/,Replacements for my Echo Shows,"We just installed security cameras, several smart switches, and are consolidating control of ""smart"" devices that we'd normally control via Echo Shows, Dots, etc.  What started as a need for a kiosk for our Arlo cameras is progressing into us cleaning up our night stands, coffee tables, counters.  Echo Show devices are way over priced for small displays & limited functionality.   


We're opting to replace our Echo devices with budget Android tablets for ease of use, portability, and flexibility to serve other purposes.  e.g. voice control of smart home via Alexa and Google, basic streaming of music & video, controlling our TV, light gaming, electronic picture frame/slide show.  

Any recommendations for budget tablets to meet our needs?  Under $150 each, 8.x to 10.x inches size, software and security update availability.  Availability of protective cases that can serve as a kickstand / easel.  Under $100 would be awesome but we get what we pay for, right?   

We're a Samsung mobile & Lenovo pc family but they aren't cheap.  Perhaps something like the Samsung A9+ line if it were to more future proof with updates.    ECOPAD, Alldocube, Xiaoxin, etc????

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

But currently I spend most of my time with my mom and her new husband (57-58 M).
I really don't mind him, he's no replacement dad because I love my dad and that's cool. He's nice too, even if he's a bit weird which honestly I think he's ADHD or whatever. Anyways, I don't know much about men or whatever, but whenever I'm up in the morning and he is too, he seems to be getting randomly 'Stiff' in the y'know what.he does this some randomly at night too around my mom and I as well, idk if she ever sees it. I always thought this was normal, but now I'm really not sure.
 Yesterday night, my mom had left to go do something for a friend and it was just us in the living because I was trying to watch TV and we were talking, and I got up and went and grabbed some of these really good peanuts to have him try cause I was Lowkey bored. I walk over to give him one, and his like whole thing was out the side of his shorts that he was wearing, I immediately looked away, walked off after giving him the peanuts and acted like I didn't see shit. He didn't fix that issue until he went to get up and get coffee when I had finally returned thinking he would have already felt a breeze or something and fixed it. It didn't look like it was 'stiff' or nothing but still that's absolutely crazy. This genuinely upset me so much, like not even kidding, and then I got left alone with him today for a few hours (Didn't tell my mom, I really don't want to ruin the already having issues second marriage because I would never hear the end of it). I got up super late around the time my mom would be close to getting off work, like 11:36 cause my mom gets off work at around 12:46. He didn't say anything about it, didn't seem to notice or care. He acted as if that was normal. Maybe he didn't notice that I saw and or was just like 'Nah' but I'm still like so upset over this, like it's made me nauseous thinking about this. 
I really don't think I'm in any danger of getting molested or nothing, but this was still just horrible Because now that's what I'm stuck associating with him for a while or whatever.

1q0xcg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q0xcg1/low_effort_espresso_machine_that_still_makes/,“Low effort” espresso machine that still makes decent espresso?? [$500],"Hi all! New here! been lurking for a while and learning a lot. 

My quick background: I’ve been a barista at a specialty coffee shop for a few months now. We use a commercial La Marzocco, but I’m here asking about \*consumer\* espresso options on behalf of my aunt, which is an area I’m less familiar with.

She received a Breville Barista Express for Xmas (her daughter purchased it for around $500 on Black Friday). I tried it out and was able to get decent results after some trial and error (dialing in; figuring out what works best with that steam wand….yikes, very low power compared to what I’m used to at work!!). 

That said, it turned out to be \*way too complicated for\* her. I live out of state, so I’m not around to make her drinks regularly. I tried giving her some lessons on dialing in and basic technique, but A) she’s a super beginner B) she works 60+ hours a week C) she’s looking for convenience. She’s planning to return the Breville and get something less complicated, and she specifically wants an espresso machine (not drip, not pour-over).

So my main question is this:

Does a consumer espresso machine exist that’s relatively convenient (and easy to learn) for someone who wants a \*quick\* espresso-based drink in the morning without a ton of steps? She likes straight espresso and Americanos. Her taste is evolving, but she’s not looking to turn this into a hobby.

I’m basically wondering if there *is* such a thing as higher(ish)-quality espresso with less effort lol. I also don’t think she’s the type to invest in an expensive standalone grinder, which I know is pretty essential for quality.

For more context-- years before I became a barista, I owned a $99 DeLonghi espresso machine. I liked it at the time, but it’s been years since I’ve used one and even \*that\* involved a process. I imagine she’d want something a bit better than that, just not overwhelming.

“What is the difference?”   
“About forty dollars a week in coffee I don’t have to buy for other people.”

Zoya sat on the floor of her apartment in Berlin. Or maybe it was London. It didn’t really matter; the IKEA rug looked the same, and the sky outside was the color of a wet sidewalk in both places. She had moved here to ""pursue a career,"" which was a polite way of saying she had run out of excuses to stay in her bedroom at home.

She was currently observing a pigeon on the windowsill. The pigeon looked busy. It was pecking at a cigarette butt with a level of intensity Zoya hadn't felt since she found a mispriced bag of pistachios in 2023.

“Should I go outside?”   
“Why?”   
“To experience the culture.”   
“I can see a church from here. It’s old. I’ve seen it. Culture experienced.”

Her phone buzzed. It was a WhatsApp message from her mother. *“Are you making friends? Did you go to that networking event for South Asian professionals?”*

Zoya stared at the screen until it went black. The thought of a ""networking event"" made her skin itch. A room full of people talking about their ""hustle"" and their ""five-year plans"" while eating lukewarm samosas. She would rather count the fibers in her rug.

“Am I a failure?”   
“Probably.”   
“Does it hurt?”   
“Not as much as wearing heels to a networking event.”

She opened her laptop. She was supposed to be applying for ""Junior Analyst"" roles. Instead, she opened a tab and typed: *“How many calories are in a single grain of rice?”* followed by *“Average lifespan of a windowsill pigeon.”*

She had $1,200 left in her account. At her current rate of eating nothing but toast and the occasional apple, she could survive for four months.

“What happens after four months?”   
“I’ll worry about that in three months and twenty-nine days.”

The city outside was screaming. Sirens, tires on wet asphalt, people shouting in a language she understood but refused to speak. Everyone was going somewhere. Everyone was ""becoming"" something. Zoya felt like a glitch in the software. She was a character that the programmers had forgotten to give a quest.

“What if I just... don’t?”   
“Don’t what?”   
“Participate. What if I just sit here until I turn into dust?”   
“The landlord might complain about the dust.”   
“True. I’ll buy a vacuum. Eventually.”

She got up, walked to the kitchen, and spent ten minutes deciding which side of the toast to butter. It was the most important decision she had made all day. It felt like enough.

She sat back down by the window. The pigeon was gone. The cigarette butt remained.

“I am an unobserved ghost in a city of strikers.”   
“That sounds poetic.”   
“No, it sounds like I need a nap.”

She set her alarm for 4:00 pm. Then 5:00 pm. Then 6:00 pm.",1,1767247807.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

Maybe I am the problem here but I want to know more.

Didn't have a normal childhood. Being SA'd, neglected by parents, bullied, beaten for things, my wants were never fulfilled so had to beg my parents or provide proofs that I needed it, trauma dumped by my parents, always compared, there were things that could've been solved in childhood such as jaws, obesity, skin but now I have to pay enormous amount of money just to work on these things. My anger is out of bounds to the point where my family is very careful of what they say and do, so that they don't irritate me. I usually stay away from them, I remember that my mother had to make coffee for me and she apologized that she was a bit late because she was caught up.

I was limerent towards a married woman that I poured my heart and soul into her to the point I lost myself. I feel ashamed of myself that I put myself through that but I still contact her not because I am still limerent to her but because she has no idea this was the case. She considers me her best friend, a person who made her world brighter apparently this has been the case with my other best friends which made me study the pattern now I am aware of it.

According to people I provide the best advice that they rely on me but I am not able to apply that to myself. People are so sure of me that it scares me that I am capable of doing great things.

This limerent object is costing me my sanity, now whenever I get a message or see her I get filled by disgust even though her husband is not at fault I am so angry, jealous, broken that she isn't with me but that guy. I can't trust my parents, I can't rely on anyone even when they provide help, I lost so many years chasing happiness, chasing validation, chasing women who chose me for the convenience of being present which I think is my fault because in my culture I was advised to stay away from girls.

I left my job since the limerent object is my co-worker , in debt although my siblings will take care of me but I don't want that so I am going to prepare for a new job. I was eating cake yesterday and I cried for a bit but quickly went back to being numb. As I am typing this I am tearing up.

I can go on and on words would be scarce to explain so I have laid out the critical points in my life. I had everything that person can dream of apart from having a relationship but now everything has lost it's meaning, I have no energy, even the foods I used to enjoy seem tasteless, my family is concerned for me and I don't care about them.

Anything that you'd like to know apart from the points, I'll be happy to provide them.

1q0x8zb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0x8zb,Coffee haul for the year (and more!),"Hello everyone! I wanted to show and tell my experience with my first full year brewing coffee. I loved coffee since I was a kid (I know, not good for me then!) Many years later I decided to get back into it as my S/O kept getting expensive coffee at basic chain cafes, when I knew I could do better. I got a V60 set and a Bodum Goose Neck Kettle to start with. Went to my local coffee shop (Phin’s Smith) and got their pre-grounded beans. It’s a Vietnamese shop so I also bought a Phin with the coffee. I worked with what I had and practiced my pour over. 

Soon after I got a King Grinder P1 as a gift and I started using whole beans. I found out lighter roast go great with the V60. I kept a journal to record my beans and techniques I would do. My go to technique is the 4:6 method, very easy to use.

I wanted something different because I felt like I kept messing up with my V60 due to my bodum kettle. So I got Aeropress as it doesn’t really need a stable pour lol. Started leveling up on that, S/O got me a metal filter and a flow control cap to make a better espresso like. I can now make a Spanish Latte and a S’mores Latte with ease. S/O really likes these ones. 

I had 3 methods of making coffee at this point. My S/O saw how much I wanted my V60 to work out, so she got me a Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Kettle for my birthday. Literally the best gift ever, my V60 has never been better. Temp is always perfect.

All in all, this has been a great year for coffee. Reddit was a constant and consistent resource and I learned a lot from everyone so I would like to thank you all. Brewing coffee is my go to ritual and I love it. It has helped me from smoking/vaping and it gets me up in the morning with a smile on my face. Keeps the wifey happy as well!

Quick Questions: 
For my King Grinder P1, I dial it down until it can’t turn anymore, then I click it 10 times to the left to set it to what I believe is 0. Do y’all do the same or do you set it to 0 as soon as it doesn’t go any further? I haven’t found a straight answer. 

After getting my Fellow Kettle I decided to get into other fun interests like Yerba Mate and now matcha, have y’all done the same? My next thing I would like to get into is the Gaiwan tea or herbal tea brewing, which ever falls into my lap first.

Thank you all again! Happy new years!",1,1767247470.0,cafe,0,0.67,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1q0x7i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1q0x7i5/turning_a_phone_number_into_a_real_date_a/,Turning a phone number into a real date: a practical texting guide,"Getting a phone number feels like progress. And it is. But it’s also just the starting point.

A lot of people lose momentum after this stage, not because they’re boring or unattractive, but because their texting either kills the vibe or never moves things forward. Too eager, too bland, too cautious, or stuck in endless small talk.

Texting isn’t about impressing someone. It’s about keeping the energy you already created and giving it somewhere to go.

Here’s what actually helps.

## 1. Send the first text while the memory is still warm

You don’t need to wait days. You also don’t need to text immediately.

A good rule is within 24 hours. If you met late at night, the next day works. If you met during the day, later that evening or the next morning is fine.

Waiting too long lets the connection cool off. Texting right away can feel rushed. Somewhere in the middle signals interest without pressure.

## 2. Reference something specific from when you met

Generic openers make you forgettable.

A callback to something you talked about instantly reminds them who you are and why they gave you their number. It also shows you were paying attention.

Instead of:
“Hey, how are you?”

Try something like:
“Did you ever try that coffee place you mentioned, or did you chicken out?”

It feels natural and easy to reply to.

## 3. Keep early texts light and short

The first few exchanges are not for deep bonding.

Think of early texting as warming things up, not laying everything out. One or two sentences is enough. A little humor helps. Open-ended questions that invite personality work better than interview-style prompts.

You’re not trying to cover everything. You’re just keeping the tone relaxed.

## 4. Balance interest with playfulness

Pure compliments get boring fast. Being distant is confusing.

A mix of both works better. Light teasing paired with genuine interest keeps things from feeling flat.

If they share something, acknowledge it, then add a small playful twist. It shows confidence without trying too hard.

## 5. Do not text all day every day

Constant texting before you’ve even met in person usually backfires.

It drains mystery, builds a false sense of closeness, and leaves nothing for the date itself. Short, enjoyable exchanges followed by space work better.

It’s okay to say you’re heading out or getting busy and then actually disappear for a bit.

## 6. Ask for the date early, not after weeks

Texting is not the goal. Meeting is.

After a few back-and-forths, it’s reasonable to suggest getting together. Waiting too long often turns things into pen-pal territory.

You don’t need a dramatic ask. Just suggest something specific and see how they respond.

Instead of:
“Do you want to hang out sometime?”

Try:
“Let’s grab coffee this week. Thursday or Saturday work better for you?”

It’s clear, calm, and confident.

## 7. Be specific with plans

Vague plans usually die.

Choose a place, a general time, and an activity. If they need to adjust, that’s fine. The point is showing that you’re capable of following through.

Specific plans reduce mental effort and make it easier to say yes.

## 8. Confirm briefly the day before

This isn’t needy. It’s practical.

A simple check-in the day before avoids confusion and shows you’re organized. Keep it casual.

Something like:
“Still good for tomorrow evening?”

That’s enough.

## 9. Handle cancellations without spiraling

If they cancel and suggest another time, great.

If they cancel without offering an alternative, respond calmly and give space. Don’t send paragraphs. Don’t chase.

Interest shows up through effort. If it’s there, it’ll resurface. If not, you’ve kept your self-respect.

## 10. If they ghost, let it go

Ghosting happens. It’s frustrating, but reacting emotionally rarely helps.

Sending angry or wounded messages doesn’t change the outcome. Moving on quietly keeps your dignity and your options open.

Sometimes it has nothing to do with you.

## A note on learning this stuff

If you’re interested in improving your texting and social awareness, some people find it helpful to study patterns instead of guessing every time. Books, podcasts, and even tools like BeFreed, Ash, Blinkist, or Headway can help you reflect on communication and attraction without turning it into a performance.

Use resources to understand yourself better, not to script every message.

## The point

Turning a number into a date isn’t about tricks.

It’s about staying relaxed, being clear about your intent, and actually suggesting something instead of hovering in limbo. Most connections fade because no one takes the next step.

It started when I posted a birthday story and he replied wishing me happy birthday and asking how I was celebrating. He also shared details about his birthday and said things like celebrating with friends is nice.

The next day he asked how my birthday went, which I found a little unexpected since we don’t really know each other and even some of my close friends didn’t ask how it went. Most people usually leave it at wishing.

Then on Christmas I posted a simple “Merry Christmas” note, and he replied “Merry Christmas :)” and immediately added: “Should def hang out and do something quick like go for a coffee when we get back to school.”

I said yeah sure, just let me know when.

Later, he guessed where I was from and when I asked how he knew, he replied: “May or may not have looked at your bio 😳🫢”

One more thing: he’s graduating this year (so he’s older) and I’m a first-year. He has completed his masters in education.

Only he has been the one initiating contact and suggesting meeting up.

So I’m confused, does this sound like someone just being friendly and social, or someone who’s low-key interested but trying to keep it chill? Also I think it is really weird for anyone to reach out to someone like this and I think when a random guy slides into a girl’s DMs, it didn’t always seem 100% platonic.",2,1767246663.0,Life,1,1.0,False

1q0wuxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q0wuxn/not_my_human/,Not my Human,"The world had grown softer at the edges.

Dad's silhouette blurred ahead of me, a dark smudge against the fading orange streetlights. Once sharp enough to spot a squirrel in a thunderstorm, my eyes now made everything swim together like grease on water. I focused on the familiar \*clunk-scuff\* of his work boots against the pavement, my stiff legs dragging just enough to keep him a few paces ahead.

\*Clunk-scuff. Pause.\*

I caught up, panting through my dry nose. His fingers found that spot behind my ears—the one that had made my back leg twitch when I was younger. Now, my bad ear just flopped like a dead thing.

\*""Good boy.""\*

No leash. There hadn't been one in years. We both knew my running days ended when my hips started clicking like an old porch swing. Not that I'd ever run from him. Not from any of them.

They'd brought me home as a squirming pup the same summer Catherine still smelled like milk and screamed all night. I'd chewed the ear off her stuffed bear. Mom had sighed (\*""A baby and a dog, Jacob? Really?""\*), but Dad just laughed and let me lick formula off his fingers.

That was a lifetime ago. Back when I could leap onto the bed in one bound when my nose could find a tennis ball buried under a pile of leaves. Now, my walks were slow. Predictable.

\*\*Until tonight.\*\*

Dad stopped where the sidewalk cracked into weeds. Beyond it, the woods loomed—a place we had never been, not since the coyotes started singing last winter. The air here smelled \*\*green and wrong\*\*, like wet earth, and the time I'd found a deer carcass with its belly split open.

\*""Stay, boy.""\*

His voice buzzed. Not the words—the sound. Like he'd swallowed a wasp.

Then he stepped into the dark.

The crunch of Dad's boots faded into the trees.

I stood there, ears twitching, my hips throbbing like they'd been packed with broken glass. \*Just breathe. Just rest a minute.\* The damp earth soaked into my fur as I collapsed onto my belly. \*\*Home\*\*, I thought. \*\*Catherine's bed was warm under the covers, her fingers knotted in my scruff like when she was little.\*\*

Then—

\*\*\*""Ah—""\*\*\*

A sound from the dark. Dad's voice, but \*\*stretched thin\*\*, like a recording played at the wrong speed. My ears pricked up, straining against the silence.

\*\*\*Squelch. Crunch.\*\*\*

The wet, greedy sound of something \*\*biting into ripe fruit\*\*. Or \*\*tearing meat from bone\*\*.

I was on my feet before I knew it, every nerve screaming—not from pain now, but from the old, wild part of my brain that still knew danger.

\*\*\*Thud. Rustle. Gurgle.\*\*\*

More noises, almost words tangled in them. Then—

\*\*\*Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.\*\*\*

Boots on twigs.

Dad stepped out of the trees.

My tail wagged once, automatically. \*\*But he walked past me like I wasn't there.\*\* No \*""Good boy.""\* No hand ruffling my ears. Just the \*\*stiff, jerking march\*\* of a man who'd forgotten how knees worked.

I limped after him, whining low in my throat. He didn't slow down. Didn't turn. The streetlights made his shadow \*\*stretch too long\*\*, fingers twitching at his sides like he was counting something.

At home, the porch light burned yellow. Dad vanished inside before I'd even reached the steps.

\*\*No held door.\*\* No chuckle as I nosed his pockets for treats. The \*\*dog door flapped shut behind me\*\*, too loud in the empty kitchen.

The house smelled wrong.

\*\*Like copper. Like a wet dog.\*\*

Like something had \*\*died in the walls.\*\*

I tried to follow Dad's scent down the hall—copper and damp fur, like a storm-soaked fox—but my hips screamed with every step. By the time I reached Catherine's door, my legs were shaking. The old me would've leaped onto her bed in one bound. Now, I collapsed onto the rug beside her, panting.

Her snores were soft and rhythmic. Safe. The familiar smell of her strawberry shampoo almost masked the other stink clinging to the house. Almost.

I licked her dangling hand. She didn't stir.

The pain in my joints dulled to a throb, but my mind wouldn't settle. That smell on Dad—moldering leaves and wet meat—it wasn't just wrong. It was old. The kind of stench that clung to deep woods and dens where things weren't supposed to die but did anyway.

My heartbeat kicked faster. Pack. Warn pack.

I hauled myself up, nails scraping the hardwood as I steadied my legs. Catherine's face was smushed into her pillow, one arm curled around Mr. Bubbles, the stuffed frog I'd ""killed"" for her three birthdays ago.

A whine built in my throat—

Click.

The sound of a toenail on tile. Not mine.

The air changed. Static. Salt. The smell of hot pennies and spoiled milk.

I turned.

The thing wearing Dad's skin stood in the doorway. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

His shadow stretched up the wall behind him—not the blocky shape of a man but something spindly, with too many elbows and knees that bent backward. The neck lengthened when the nightlight flickered, stretching like taffy before snapping back to normal. His eyes caught the glow—just for a second—flashing yellow-green like a coyote's caught in headlights, pupils slit vertically instead of round. Hungry. He didn't blink, staring with those unblinking predator's eyes as if waiting for me to bark, wake Catherine, and force him to peel off that face and show us what writhed underneath.

Then—

""Bedtime, Buddy.""

The voice was Dad's, but wet like it had to push through a throat full of maggots.

Catherine stirred. The thing's head rotated toward her—smooth, boneless—and its jaw unhinged slightly. A thread of saliva stretched between its teeth.

I growled, low and rattling, the sound that used to make burglars freeze on our porch.

The thing exhaled through its nose—a hiss of rotting leaves—and stepped back. Not walking. Gliding. Its shadow stayed behind for a heartbeat, clawing at the doorframe before snapping back to its heels.

The dark swallowed it whole.

But the smell remained.

It's like a wet den, like a gutted deer, like something that remembers how to wear skin but not how to wash the death off.

I stayed pressed against Catherine's bed all night, watching the door. Waiting for the eyes to reappear.

Waiting for the real Dad to come home.

The next morning, Dad's smell had worsened.

It hit me the moment I limped into the kitchen—\*\*thick and meaty\*\*, like when we'd find dead raccoons under the porch in summer. He stood at the counter, his back to me, shoulders hunched wrong. Too high. Too sharp.

\*""Morning, Buddy.""\*

His voice cracked down the middle, splitting into two tones: Dad's baritone and something \*\*buzzing\*\* beneath it. He turned slowly as if his spine had too many joints.

I froze.

His eyes were still brown… but the whites had yellowed, veins bulging black like cracks in old ice. His lips stretched too wide when he smiled, showing gums that oozed pink-tinged saliva.

\*\*""Hungry?""\*\*

He dropped a handful of kibble into my bowl. It landed with a \*\*wet slap\*\*, the pellets glistening with something oily. The smell made my nose wrinkle—\*\*antiseptic and spoiled milk.\*\*

From the table, Catherine giggled.

She couldn't see it. Couldn't \*\*smell\*\* it.

Dad's hand twitched toward her hair, then jerked back like he'd been burned. His fingers curled into claws for a second before flattening.

\*""Eat up, Buddy,""\* he murmured.

But his jaw kept moving after the words stopped, \*\*grinding side to side like a cow chewing cud.\*\* A chunk of something dark wedged between his molars—\*\*maybe meat. Maybe fabric.\*\*

I whimpered.

Dad's head snapped toward me. His nostrils flared, \*\*inhaling my fear.\*\* Then he winked—\*\*slow, deliberate\*\*—with an eyelid that closed \*vertically.\*

The bath came without warning.

One moment, I was dozing by Catherine's homework; the next—\*\*cold hands clamped around my belly\*\*, lifting me toward the tub. The thing wearing Dad's face smiled down at me, its breath reeking of \*\*roadkill and mint toothpaste.\*\*

\*""You stink, mutt.""\*

The water burned. Not from heat—from whatever \*\*slick, iridescent soap\*\* it poured into the stream. My fur matted instantly, weighing me down as its fingers dug between my shoulders.

\*""Let's see…""\*

Its nails—\*\*too long, too curved\*\*—parted my fur like skinning a rabbit. I yelped as they scraped my bare flesh, probing for something.

\*""Almost ripe,""\* it whispered.

Then Catherine was there, giggling as she rubbed shampoo in my ears. \*""Dad's being weird again!""\*

The thing laughed—\*\*Dad's laugh, Dad's teeth\*\*—but its eyes stayed locked on mine. \*\*Black pupils swallowing brown.\*\*

I found the skin three nights later.

The laundry room hummed with the scent of \*\*blood and fabric softener.\*\* There, tangled in Mom's sweatpants—\*\*a palm-sized patch of Dad.\*\*

Pink at the edges. Still \*\*warm.\*\*

His Marine Corps tattoo stared up at me, the eagle's wings crumpled like crepe paper. I nudged it with my nose. \*\*No smell.\*\* As if it had never been alive.

Above the dryer, the basement door creaked open.

\*""Buddy?""\*

The thing stood on the stairs, backlit by the kitchen light. Its silhouette was \*\*all wrong—spine too straight, arms too long.\*\*

\*""Come.""\*

It was Dad's voice. Then Catherine's. Then \*\*nothing human at all.\*\*

The mirror became its favorite toy.

I'd catch it at night, standing in the hallway, \*\*practicing.\*\*

First, Dad's scratchy morning voice: \*""Coffee's ready.""\*

Then Mom's sigh: \*""Jacob, not again.""\*

Then Catherine's—\*\*high, sweet, perfect\*\*—as its jaw unhinged to make room for the pitch: \*""I love you, Buddy!""\*

Last night, it noticed me watching.

Its reflection didn't.

The thing in the mirror kept mouthing words while the real one turned, \*\*neck rotating like an owl's\*\*, and whispered:

\*""Want to play fetch?""\*

It held up Dad's severed hand.

The fingers twitched.

The food got better.

That was the first thing I noticed. No more kibble—now it was \*\*bacon glistening with grease\*\*, \*\*steak scraps still pink in the middle\*\*, \*\*chicken skin crackling hot from the pan\*\*. The kind of food I used to beg for with drooling desperation.

The taste was… \*\*off.\*\* A metallic tang underneath, like licking the bottom of Mom's slow cooker. But I ate it anyway. My teeth weren't what they used to be, and hunger drowned out the warnings in my gut.

I slept more, too.

Deep, heavy sleeps where my legs twitched with dreams of running—\*\*real running\*\*, the kind I hadn't done in years. I'd wake panting to find \*\*Dad's hands\*\* on me, parting my fur, pressing cold fingers to the thin skin of my belly.

\*""Good boy,""\* he'd murmur, but his voice kept changing. Sometimes, it was Mom's. Sometimes Catherine's. Sometimes it was \*\*no voice at all\*\*, just a wet clicking in his throat.

I wanted to growl, to bite, but my body felt \*\*loose and warm\*\* like I was floating in the bathtub again.

The chocolate smelled so sweet.

A whole bar of it melted on the kitchen tiles. \*\*Dark. Shiny.\*\* The kind Mom used to scream at Catherine for leaving out.

I shouldn't. I \*knew\* I shouldn't.

But my tongue dragged me forward anyway, lapping at the sticky puddle. It tasted \*\*bitter and wrong\*\*, but underneath—\*\*so rich, so familiar.\*\* Like the time Catherine secretly shared her Halloween candy when I was still young enough to jump onto her bed.

My legs buckled.

The tiles were cool against my cheek. From somewhere far away, I heard \*\*footsteps.\*\* Too many. Too light.

\*""Is it working?""\* Catherine asked. Except it wasn't Catherine. Hadn't been for a while.

\*""Almost,""\* Dad said. His shadow stretched over me, \*\*long and spindly\*\*, fingers brushing my ear one last time.

\*""Good dog.""\*

I closed my eyes.

He did come with his friend though so they made it a guy weekend away during the day and came around in the evenings when my partner and I finished work. We actually had good chats and I finished the visit sad it hadn’t happened sooner. I then went to his wedding in the autumn even though my sister wanted nothing to do with him or the wedding. Since then I have chatted with him on and off, called, etc. So I decided to throw caution to the wind and finally accept a throw-away invite he always offers: to come visit him where he works on a holiday park. BAD IDEA. 

He drove to the station to pick us up, showed us to our accommodation, a caravan around the corner from where he works, spent one dinner with us at the lousy cafe they have on site and f\*cked off at 7:30 pm. I haven’t spent any alone time with him since. I didn’t see him yesterday except in the evening while he was working the dj both at the clubhouse (my dad is the resident dj) of the park. His new wife, who I’ve only met once, was there so my partner and I exchanged some small talk with her awkwardly before finding something else to do. I was a bit peed off because, our caravan being round the corner, he could definitely have popped in to say hello. But he didn’t. Didn’t even text me to say a ‘sorry I’m so slammed today, you guys up to much?’ Nope, radio silence. The day before he had also mentioned that he had a few things to do but could get off early. So I expected him to check in and ask if we could meet or whatever. Nothing. Then later he texts me to say his wife and stepkids are here and asks if I’m coming into the clubhouse tonight. His wife and stepkids, who see him every day, get to see him but I’m literally staying a minute walk away from where he was all day and I don’t get anything?! I just get an invite to a noisy room where I get no 1-1 time at all? Even though I travelled on a plane and a train to get here, and I get this…really?! Just one of his offspring from his first marriage but no biggie, guess I don’t matter! I had a headache today (no doubt my body telling me I should not be here) and I was in two minds whether to go to the NYE party he was doing. Then I got upset about how I really feel - disappointed, embarrassed, let down - and decided I wouldn’t go on principle. Instead I spent NYE with my love on the sofa watching movies - exactly as at home except 500 yards away from my dad who doesn’t give a sh\*t.

The problem with my dad over the years has been that whenever he’s got a new girlfriend and she has her own kids, me and my sister were always kind of expected to just blend in and love them because he loves them. He has always been bad with introducing us properly, making a moment out of it to make us feel welcome. And because of this, I always felt awkward or like I didn’t belong in his life whenever I stayed at his house during school holidays. I thought as an adult I was over that feeling, but his suggestion of ‘(wife’s name) is here, you can sit with her and chat’ just took me right back to being a teenager where I felt awkward AF. It’s always us that have to do the blending in, his new wife doesn’t have to make any effort. Her teenage daughters also seemed weirded out that some random relative has shown up. The other thing about my dad is that he will say he misses you, but when you visit him (I remember fondly from childhood) he will just busy himself with work or whatever.’ Ever since he’s been self-employed, that’s all I’ve known. I miss the days when he had an office job and he could take off proper holiday days to spend time with my sister and I. On this trip, I didn’t expect him to take a day off - it’s his busiest time of year as an entertainer - but I did think he’d make more effort with popping in for a tea for ten minutes or maybe arranging for his new family and us to hang out without loud music pumping…we could have had a little casual dinner before he went to work…or maybe his new wife could’ve asked me for a coffee while he was busy. I feel like this lack of time spent together is on him, but also if my husband’s daughter was in town, I would make some effort to make her feel welcome?! Ideal world scenario, I know. But I just feel like some more effort could’ve come from their side in general, being that I haven’t visited him in almost 10 years and I live abroad so it’s not like I’m round the corner where I can come another time. 

The most embarrassing thing is I got him a birthday cake and even decorated it with sprinkles. Maybe that was my inner child begging for a connection. All I wanna do now if pack my stuff up and fly home. I regret getting on that plane. I could’ve gone home to my lovely apartment with my fiancé. But I’m stuck in a sh\*tty caravan park until my dad can do the only thing he is good at apparently, which is dropping us off at the train station. 

Before this trip, my dad was definitely on my wedding guest list, but now? This trip has showed me in its simplicity how distant he is from me. He cannot give me the father-daughter one on one time I need to feel closer to him. And I guess I don’t need it. Crazy how your view of someone can change after one trip. Thank god my fiancé is nothing like him! 

Is this a common thing to happen: you connect over the phone, small milestone then when you visit them in their bubble, you realise that they actually don’t seem to care as much about you as they say?

Genuinely this has made me question my optimistic ‘life’s too short not to forgive your stupid dad’ and I’m thinking about putting boundaries in place and never visiting him or seeing him in person again. ",1,1767245644.0,EstrangedAdultChild,0,1.0,False

Started in freshman year with one cup in the morning and now I'm a junior who literally can't function before noon without caffeine. My stomach is constantly messed up and I get anxiety spikes that make focusing even harder but I can’t get off it anymore.

I tried switching to energy drinks thinking they'd be better but that just made my heart race and I'd crash even harder a few hours later. Then I tried those caffeine pills from cvs which worked okay but felt like I was just swallowing speed to get through exams.

I know people say ""just sleep more"" but that's not realistic when you're taking 18 credits, working part time, and trying to have some kind of social life. I need something to help me focus during those long study sessions but I'm getting sick of feeling jittery and anxious all the time.

Also tried nicotine gums last semester which helped without the jitters but I think it’s not the best option to use nicotine. I'm curious what else people use. I know I’m not the only one with this problem but it feels like everyone is either chugging coffee, popping adderall, or just constantly exhausted.

1q0wj8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q0wj8b/i_didnt_apply_for_the_internal_role_part_1/,I didn’t apply for the internal role. (Part 1),"The alarm went off at 6:30. I didn’t wake up right away. I never do.

For a few seconds, I was convinced that I could just stay there. That if I stayed really still and didn’t leave the bed, the day wouldn’t start yet. The ceiling above my bed has a faint crack running from the corner toward the light fixture. I have watched it long enough to know exactly where it fades out. I don’t remember when I noticed it the first time. Just that it has always been there when I needed something to stare at.

I hit snooze.

When the alarm went off again, that was the one I actually woke up to. Not because it was louder, just because by then the math had already settled in. If I didn’t get up now, I would be late. If I were late, I would lose the overtime hours. If I lost the overtime, the bills wouldn’t line up the way I needed them to. I sighed and sat up. The floor was cold. I noticed that immediately. I always do.

I shuffled into the kitchen and hit the coffee maker without really looking at it. I had set it up the night before. Grounds measured. Water filled. Like a small gift to my future groggy self. The coffee finished brewing while I leaned against the counter and waited. It smelled fine. Not good. Not bad. Just enough caffeine to keep me conscious while I stared at a screen for the next eight hours. I grabbed the same chipped mug I’ve had since college. The handle is a little loose now. I keep meaning to replace it. I never do.

As I watched the coffee pot finish, it reminded me of a different kitchen for a moment. Smaller. Messier. Too many people packed into it at once. Back when coffee meant staying up late on purpose. I was in college then. I remember thinking I was exhausted all the time, which now seems funny. I had no idea what tired actually felt like yet. I drank terrible coffee back then too. Burnt. Too strong. Always cold by the time I finished it. But it felt different. It felt like fuel. I had plans then. Not big cinematic ones. Just enough to feel like I was moving toward something. I remember sitting in a lecture hall one morning, half asleep, writing ideas in the margins of my notebook instead of taking notes. Nothing concrete. Just possibilities. I thought I would figure things out as I went. I truly believed that. I believed effort mattered. That showing up would eventually turn into momentum. That if I kept trying, even badly, something would open up. I don’t remember what I thought that something was. Just that it felt close.

The coffee maker clicked off, and the sound pulled me back. Same kitchen. Same counter. Same mug with the loose handle. I took a sip. It tasted fine.

I don’t think that version of me was wrong. I think they just didn’t know how long eventually could be. Standing there in my kitchen, holding mediocre coffee, I didn’t feel bitter. I felt patient. Like maybe I hadn’t missed my chance. Like things don’t stop being fixable just because they take longer than you expected. While the coffee cooled, I checked my phone. No messages. No missed calls. Just the usual reminders. Payments due. Pending. Overdue. I have gotten a few disconnect warnings over the past couple of months. Nothing serious yet. Still fixable. That is what mattered right now. Everything was still fixable.

“I am not unhappy.”

I needed to say it out loud. I think people confuse tired with miserable. I have a job. It’s not exciting, but it is stable. I have an apartment. It is small, but it is quiet. I can pay most of my bills on time. The rest, I am working on. Some days, when I let myself think about it, I actually believe things could get better. Not dramatically. Not all at once. Just incrementally. I rinsed out the mug and set it upside down in the rack. The handle wobbled. I adjusted it.

Riley was already on the bus when I got on, sitting in the same seat by the window. She glanced up from her phone and smiled. “You’ re cutting it close,” she said. “Still counts,” I told her. She hummed like she agreed. The ride passed quietly. Riley pointed out a new sign someone had put up near the corner store. A dog stubbornly refusing to walk. Small things. The kind you only notice when you have someone to notice them with. We got off at the stop near work and walked the last block together.

By the time we reached the parking lot, the others were already there. Julian stood a little apart, leaning against his car, watching the building like he always did. Caleb leaned against his car with a cup of coffee in hand. “Morning,” he said when he saw me. “Morning.” Paige’s car pulled in a little too fast, brakes squeaking as she slid into her usual spot. She jumped out, keys already in hand, hair still damp like she had rushed out the door. “Don’t start,” she said immediately, pointing at us before anyone could speak. “I wasn’t going to say anything,” Riley replied. “I was just going to look at you like this.” She crossed her arms and tilted her head dramatically. “Traffic,” Paige said. “Every day,” Julian added. “Same road. Same time.” “Yeah,” Paige said. “But today it was personal.”

I smiled without realizing I was doing it.

Caleb stood the way he always did. Relaxed without looking careless. Coffee cup held low, like it was part of the morning rather than something he needed. Julian stayed a step apart from the rest of us, hands in his pockets, eyes moving more than his body. Like he was already paying attention to something the rest of us hadn’t noticed yet. Paige never fully stopped moving. Even now, she shifted her weight, keys tight in her hand, hair pulled back too quickly to be intentional. Riley leaned into the moment without effort. Arms crossed loosely. Expression already halfway into a joke. She caught my eye and lifted her brows, like she saw me noticing. For a second, everything felt exactly where it was supposed to be.

Caleb took a sip of his coffee. “Anyone else think the break room coffee tastes worse when you’re already tired?” “That implies it tasted good at some point,” Julian said. “It’s not coffee,” Riley said. “It is brown encouragement.”

We all laughed. Not loud. Not forced. The kind of laugh that just happens. We stood there a few seconds longer than we needed to. No one said we were waiting. No one had to. There used to be more of us. Not all at once. One at a time. Different reasons. Different exits.

Ethan didn’t move away. Not really. He just started missing things. Then avoiding them. Then choosing work over us in a sense that felt deliberate instead of necessary. We told ourselves it was temporary. He told us it was. Eventually it stopped feeling like distance and started feeling like a decision. Grace got busy in a way that made everything else fall to the side. Archer just drifted. No argument. No goodbye. Just fewer replies until there weren’t any. Not everyone faded out quietly. One of them left, and the sound lingered. We said things we cannot unsay. And then we stopped saying anything at all.

We don’t talk about that one. We don’t need to.

Paige checked the time. We all did the same. Habit. “Alright,” she said with a sigh. “Let us go make money.” We split off toward the building. Different doors. Same place. Work passed the way it usually does. Emails. Meetings. A box of stale, store bought donuts someone brought in because it was their turn. At the end of the day, I felt tired but not empty. The good kind of tired. The kind that makes you believe rest will help.

That night, lying in the dark, I thought about the people I had stood with that morning. Riley came first, the way she usually did. She had a way of pointing things out that made the world feel bigger instead of heavier. Like there were still options I hadn’t exhausted yet. She talked about possibilities the way other people talked about weather. Casual. Inevitable. Worth noticing. Paige was harder to pin down, mostly because she never put herself in the center of anything. She just kept track. Of people. Of moods. Of when someone hadn’t shown up in a while. If the group felt steady, it was usually because she had adjusted something quietly without asking for credit. Julian noticed things before the rest of us did. Not in a dramatic way. Just small inconsistencies. Tiny patterns that didn’t quite line up. He didn’t always share what he saw, but when he did, it was because it mattered. I trusted his silences almost as much as his words.

And then there was Caleb.

Caleb was steady, dependable to a fault. The kind of person who made plans and followed through. The kind who stayed where he said he would. He didn’t talk much about the future, but when he did, it sounded like something that could actually happen.

I trusted them. All of them. In different ways. That felt important. I didn’t know why. I stared at the ceiling for a while longer, tracing the familiar crack with my eyes. Then I rolled onto my side, pulled the blanket up to my chin, and let the day go. Whatever tomorrow was going to be, I would deal with it when it arrived. For now, this was enough.

By the time Riley and I reached the parking lot the next morning, most of the others were already there. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building without really looking at it. Caleb leaned against his car, scrolling through his phone, coffee balanced easily in one hand. Paige was pacing a short line between two parked cars, like she had something she was waiting to say. “Hey,” Riley greeted everyone, lifting her hand as we approached. “Morning,” I said. Paige turned toward us immediately. “Okay. News.” That was enough to pull everyone’s attention in at once.

“Two people in my department got promoted,” she said. “Officially. New titles. Better pay.” Riley blinked. “Already? Didn’t they just restructure?” “That is what I thought,” Paige said. “But apparently they’re fast tracking some positions” she shrugged. Caleb glanced up from his phone. “They’ve been quietly posting internal listings for weeks.” He turned his phone to show the group. Julian nodded once. “I noticed that too.”

I hadn’t.

Paige looked at me. “I thought of you when I heard.” Something in my chest lifted before I could stop it. “Me?” I asked. “Yeah,” she said. “You would be perfect for something like that. You already do half of what those roles require.” Riley smiled at me like it was obvious. “She’s not wrong, ya know.” I laughed, a little embarrassed, but I didn’t deflect the way I usually would. I let the thought sit there for a second.

Maybe. The word felt dangerous and exciting all at once.

“That would be nice,” I said. And I meant it. Caleb met my eyes briefly, then nodded. “It would.” We stood there a few seconds longer than necessary, the way we always did. No one rushing. No one checking the time yet. Eventually, Paige sighed and glanced at her watch. “Alright. If we don’t go in now, I am going to be late for something I already don’t want to be at.” “Fiiiiineeeee,” Riley said with an over exaggerated sigh. We laughed, and then we split off toward the building. Still different doors. Still the same place.

The building felt the same as it always did when I walked in. Same fluorescent hum. Same muted conversations drifting down the hallway. Nothing about the place looked different. But it felt different. I caught myself paying closer attention than usual. Listening in meetings instead of just attending them. Noticing which names came up when people talked about new projects or upcoming shifts. I didn’t push myself forward. I also didn’t shrink back.

At my desk, I opened my email and scanned through the usual messages. Deadlines. Reminders. A calendar invite I had already half forgotten about. And then I saw it. An internal posting. Nothing flashy. Just a quiet line in the subject header about role expansion and departmental support. Normally, I would have archived it without thinking. Instead, I opened it. The description felt familiar. Responsibilities I already handled. Skills I had picked up over time without ever really naming them. The kind of work that didn’t feel like a stretch so much as a shift. I re-read it twice before I realized I was smiling. I didn’t apply. Not yet. But I bookmarked it. That felt like something.

Later, in a meeting that usually faded into the background, someone asked a question that no one answered right away. I found myself speaking up before I had talked myself out of it. My voice didn’t shake. No one looked surprised. The conversation moved on, but something lingered.

At lunch, Paige stopped by my desk under the pretense of borrowing a pen. “You look different today,” she said. “Different how?” I asked. She smiled. “Like you’re thinking about something.” I shrugged, but I didn’t deny it. Riley sent me a message a little later. Nothing important. Just a joke about the vending machine eating her money again. I laughed out loud before I realized I was doing it. The afternoon passed more quickly than usual. By the time my shift ended, I wasn’t exhausted in the way I normally was. I felt alert. Like I had leaned forward instead of bracing myself. Walking out of the building, I caught my reflection in the glass doors. I looked the same. But something underneath felt newly awake. I didn’t know what I was going to do with that yet. But for the first time in a while, it felt like a choice.

The bus was quieter on the way back. Most people stared at their phones or leaned their heads against the windows, the day already starting to drain out of them. Riley sat beside me like she always did, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling without really looking at anything. “You were happier today,” she said after a while. “Was I?” She nodded. “In a subtle thinking way. Not a bad way.” I watched the city slide past the window. Storefronts I recognized. Corners I could name without trying. “I think Paige might be right,” I said finally. Riley glanced at me. “About the promotion thing?” “Yeah.” She smiled, not surprised. “I told you.” I huffed softly. “You always do.” “That is because you always forget,” she said, nudging my knee lightly with hers. I thought about the posting. The bookmark. The way it had felt to speak up in that meeting without rehearsing it in my head first. “I didn’t apply,” I said. “I know.” I looked at her. “How?” “You would have told me if you did,” she said. “Or you would be panicking right now.” That was true. The bus slowed at our stop. “But,” Riley added as we stood, “you are thinking about it. And that counts.” I nodded. It did.

Paige lived in a small duplex not too far from work, the kind of place that always smelled faintly like whatever she had cooked last. When Riley and I arrived, the lights were already on and the door was unlocked. “Shoes off,” Paige called from the kitchen before we even announced ourselves. Caleb was already there, sitting at the table with a drink in his hand, sleeves rolled up like he had been helping with something. Julian leaned against the counter nearby, watching Paige move around the kitchen like he was cataloging it.

“You’re late,” Paige said, but she smiled when she said it. “We took the scenic route,” Riley replied. “There is no scenic route,” Paige said. “Exactly.”

We settled in the way we always did. Someone claimed the couch. Someone else grabbed an extra chair from the corner. Plates were passed around without asking. Conversation overlapped and doubled back on itself. At some point, Caleb handed me a drink I hadn’t asked for. “Figured,” he said with a shrug, a warm smile and a slight wink. “Thanks.” Julian asked a question that turned into a debate. Paige disappeared and came back with more food. Riley kicked her feet up onto the coffee table like she owned the place. I sat there and let it happen. At one point, Paige looked around the room and sighed, content. “I like this,” she said. “We should keep doing this even when work gets stupid.” “When?” Riley echoed. “Work is already stupid.” “True,” Paige conceded. I laughed, and it surprised me how easy it felt.

Later, when the night wound down and people started checking the time, I helped Paige stack plates in the sink. “You okay?” she asked quietly. “Yeah,” I said. “I think I am.” She nodded like that answer made sense.

Walking home later, the air felt cooler. Lighter. I didn’t know what the next step was yet. But for the first time, it felt like I didn’t have to take it alone.

Saturday passed more slowly than I expected. I cleaned my apartment in pieces, starting and stopping whenever something else caught my attention. Laundry sat folded on the couch longer than it needed to. Dishes dried in the rack while I stood there, staring at them without really seeing them.

At some point in the afternoon, I opened my laptop. I didn’t mean to look for anything specific. I just did. The post was still bookmarked.

I hovered over it for a second before clicking.

It looked the same as it had on Friday. Same title. Same careful language. Same list of responsibilities that felt uncomfortably familiar.

**Position: Operations Support Coordinator**

**Division: Internal Systems and Continuity**

**Posting Type: Internal Expansion**

The listing was hosted on Axiom’s internal board, but the footer carried a smaller line of attribution that I didn’t remember seeing before.

^(“)*^(Reviewed in alignment with First Principle Collective.”)*

The description was short. Careful. Almost intentionally plain.

**^(“Provide operational support across multiple departments during periods of transition. Maintain documentation and process consistency to reduce workflow disruption. Assist in identifying gaps, redundancies, and unresolved escalations. Act as a liaison between teams when responsibilities overlap or stall.”)**

There wasn’t anything flashy about it. No promises. No urgency. Just quiet expectations. The qualifications were worse.

**^(“Demonstrates reliability and follow through. Strong written communication and organizational awareness. Ability to work independently with minimal oversight. Comfort operating in evolving or undefined structures.”)**

I read that last line twice. I had been doing most of this already. Not officially. Not because anyone had asked. Just because things tended to fall apart if no one did. At the bottom of the posting, separated by a thin gray line, was a final note.

*^(Qualified candidates may be identified internally based on observed performance and organizational need.)*

I imagined what it would be like to do that work officially instead of incidentally. To have it recognized. To stop feeling like I was quietly proving myself to people who didn’t know they were watching. I opened a blank document. Just in case. I typed my name at the top.

*“Nicole Bennett.”*

I stared at it for what felt like hours, until a dog outside barked and snapped me back. I closed the document.

On Sunday, I tried again. This time I told myself I was just practicing. That there was no pressure. That no one would see it unless I wanted them to. I sat at my kitchen table with a mug of reheated coffee and pulled the posting up again. I reread the qualifications, nodding along like I was agreeing with something obvious.

I started drafting a message. Nothing formal. Just a note.

*“Interest expressed. Experience mentioned. Confidence implied.”*

I deleted the first sentence. Then the second. I wrote a third version that sounded too apologetic and erased that one, too. By the time the light outside shifted and the room dimmed, I had rewritten the same paragraph six times. Each version felt wrong in a different way. Too eager. Too cautious. Too confident. Not confident enough. I closed my laptop and walked away from it.

Later that night, curled up on the couch with a blanket pulled over my knees, I opened it again. One last try.

I reread what I had written and imagined hitting send. I imagined the waiting. The wondering. The second guessing every word. I imagined the email being opened by someone who already had a name in mind. My chest tightened. I highlighted the text. Deleted it. Then I closed the posting. Unbookmarked it. I told myself I would think about it again later. Sunday nights are good at that. Convincing you there is always more time. I went to bed telling myself it was fine. That I hadn’t missed anything yet. Monday morning came faster than I expected.

The alarm went off at 6:30, and this time I didn’t hit snooze. I lay there for a few seconds anyway, staring at the ceiling, tracing the familiar crack without really seeing it. My chest felt tight. Not anxious, exactly. Just alert. Like something had already started moving without asking me. I got up and moved through the routine on autopilot. Cold floor. Coffee maker. Same chipped mug. Everything where it was supposed to be. The coffee tasted the same as always.

On the bus, Riley sat beside me, scrolling through her phone with one earbud half in, the way she did when she was open to conversation but not demanding it. The city slid past the windows in a blur of corners and storefronts I could have named without thinking. “You’re quiet,” she said after a while. “I’m fine,” I said. And I meant it. Mostly. She nodded, satisfied, and turned back to her screen. I didn’t open my laptop. I didn’t think about the posting. I told myself that whatever I had felt over the weekend had settled. That I had done the responsible thing by not rushing into something I wasn’t ready for. By the time we got off the bus and walked the last block, the thought felt convincing enough to believe.

The parking lot was already half full. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building with that distant focus of his. Paige was talking animatedly about something that had happened over the weekend, using her hands like punctuation. Caleb leaned against his car, coffee in hand, listening more than he spoke. “Morning,” Riley said as we approached. “Morning,” Paige echoed. “You look awake today.” “Do I?” I asked. She smiled. “More than usual.” I reached into my pocket to check the time. That was when my phone buzzed.

Just once.

I almost ignored it. I expected a calendar reminder. A payment notification. Something automated and impersonal. Instead, I saw an email preview from an internal address I didn’t recognize. The subject line was careful. Neutral.

**Opportunity for Discussion.**

I stopped walking. Riley noticed immediately. “Hey. What’s up?” “I” I started, then stopped. Paige turned toward me, mid sentence. “What is it?” “I think,” I said slowly, looking down at my phone again, “I just got an email I wasn’t expecting.” Julian tilted his head slightly, attention sharpening. Caleb glanced over, then back at my face. “Is that good?” “I don’t know,” I said honestly. The email sat there, unopened. Waiting.

For a second, I thought about Sunday night. About the draft I had deleted. About unbookmarking the posting. About how certain I had felt that I still had time. My thumb hovered over the screen. Then I took a breath. And opened it. The email didn’t load. I tapped it once. Then again. The preview stayed stubbornly vague, replaced by a short line beneath the subject.

**This message must be accessed from a secure workstation.**

I stared at it longer than I should have. Riley leaned in slightly. “What does it say?” “It doesn’t,” I said. “It just won’t open.” Paige frowned. “Like a system error?” “I don’t know,” I said. My mouth felt dry. “It says I have to open it from a secure workstation.” Julian’s brow furrowed. “That’s not that weird. Some system messages are locked like that.” That didn’t help. Caleb tilted his head, studying my face. “You didn’t apply for anything, did you?” “No,” I said immediately. Too quickly. “I didn’t send anything.”Riley looked at me. “Are you sure?” “Yes,” I said. Then, softer, “I’m sure.” Because I was.

I remembered it clearly. Closing the document. Deleting the draft. Unbookmarking the posting. I hadn’t typed anything except my name. My name. A tight, unwelcome thought slid in anyway.

They have a strong affinity with graveyards, as everybody knows, being where they spend most of their time out and about. You'd often find them there, listening to dark music or writing one of their poems, as this nightly routine of theirs is their only form of comfort, as they envy the sun and brightness.

TW: Arson mentioned

When Poe was first born, before they became non-binary, they lived in a dark and lonely neighborhood with their parents, who were judged nonstop by the public, as ravens suffered from harassment from xenophobes due to their awful reputation, and their kind would be horribly judged and mistreated by society. 

Poe lived alongside their sibling, Byron (The raven member of the Daydream Critters, who is also non-binary), who is a leucistic raven, and, like their color scheme, was rather more cheerful and friendly, which wasn’t to say that Poe wasn’t at the time, as they tried to be. But they got horrible treatment when in the outside world such as at school or public. Their parents weren’t safe either as they dealt with harassment all over the place.

Even after everything, Byron still stuck by their sibling’s side, as a means of protecting Poe and helping them find happiness in themself. Unfortunately, Poe struggled to find much of anything to love about themself. They found their entire existence to be a curse, and like they were at fault for the harassment their family had casted upon them. 

The self-loathing only got worse when their house one day got burned down by a xenophobic pyromaniac, and they lost so many of their belongings, and Poe's father nearly died due to smoke inhalation, which landed him in the hospital. Poe and their family had to stay at their grandmother’s house, as Byron managed to find friends that didn’t judge them and cared about them (Which turns out to be the Nightmare Critters), but Poe still struggled to make any friends, and still felt like an outcast and burden. Even when their father made it through, it still didn’t help Poe feel any better, as they felt like a problem.

One night, Poe escaped a violent confrontation with a pair of their bullies in the woods, and after they left their hiding spot, they got lost, and wandered towards a graveyard. For some reason, it felt peaceful there. They found serenity and joy by being where they were right now. They took a liking to poetry upon reading a gravestone of a poet, that had one of their poems encased on the tombstone. From that day forward, they the graveyards were the only place they could find anything other than pain and sadness. They loved it because nobody talks, although in Poe's words “Although sometimes I wish they did….”

The reason Poe always appeared as a dark, gloomy and pessimistic brooder was due to the nonstop mistreatment they and their family would face for years on end. It was relentless and ruthless, and why they prefer the dark graveyards they’d constantly be found at, as it was their only source of peace and happiness deep down. It also explains why they tend to get angry under pressure come off as envious, as the amount of abuse they would suffer all around made them mistrustful and easily irritated, showing hints of anxiety in their emo appearance. Despite all of this, like all the other Nightmare Critters, Poe cared deeply for their friends, despite their flaws, as when Baba snapped one day and hurt Dogday in a physically violent way due to her trauma building up and making her lash out, the others were scared of her, but Poe stuck by her side, as they knew deep down, just like them, Baba was someone who faced suffering and hardship, and it was thanks to them that they got everyone to forgive her.

During the Nightmare Critters' redemption arcs, as they let the Smiling Crew in to help them and make amends with them, Poe learns how to find happiness and to accept others in to help them. Thanks to the Smiling Crew, they learn how to be more optimistic and see the good things in life, and to trust others again, and to learn to love themself. They would begin to reach out to Byron and their parents to apologize for their years of absence, which leads to the family reconciling and finally finding love and affection, as everyone at Playtime Co. shows their support regardless of their type.  Meaning if their parents or Byron were ever in a deeply painful situation, they are free to come to Playtime Co. as a place to feel safe. They help teach the kids of Playtime Co. poetry, and even teaches them to put in their best to write stories.

Decided to clean my room because new year energy. Picked up one sock, sat on the bed, checked my phone, and somehow it was 25 minutes later. Productivity is a myth created by LinkedIn.

Made coffee. Drank it standing, staring at the wall like it’s giving a performance review. For a moment I missed the office pantry. At least there, pretending to work feels social.

Opened my laptop out of habit. No mails. No Slack pings. Closed it immediately before responsibility could see me online.

Scrolled Zomato even though I’m not hungry. Scrolled Swiggy too, for comparison. This is what adulthood is. Eventually ate whatever was already at home and felt emotionally mature.

At some point I opened a dating app, saw people with year-wise glow-up plans, and closed it like a popup ad. I don’t have that kind of bandwidth in Q1.

It took me a few days to understand. Never met him, never ran in his circles, and none of that mattered. Adam was there probably 3-4 days a week in the morning with me for my coffee before work. He'd usually have a video waiting for me when I sat down. Some videos I skipped, some I watched with relentless intent, and when the news of his passing came my way it took me about a day to break down and really feel how it broke my heart. I didn't need to know Adam, because you saw his impact with everyone he was with. Andor just coined a phrase and Adam embodies it.... ""I have friends everywhere"" this is so true about Adam and really shines a light on what a positive impact Adam had on people he loved, people he interacted with, and people like me sitting at home drinking my coffee.

Adam was a boon that enhanced peoples lives. Some more personal than others, and what has broken me about this is that we just lost that light that impacted so many. A pillar that lifts and holds people up and especially after hearing all the stories about him, a pillar that people relied on and not even knowing perhaps how much of a pillar he was. Since Adam's passing, I've watched his friends describe and show how they loved and cherished him. What impacts me now is that saying of ""stop thinking about it and do it "" So I've been feeling his presence in the day to day to rather do what I've been thinking about rather than thinking about it. Thank you Adam, and thank you for all his friends that have made videos and comments to help me understand who we lost and their global impact. We lost a powerhouse, and I feel like it's us who were a part of his life even if he didn't know about us, to fill in this enormous gap that he has left behind.

Sixteen Significant South Side Sandwiches, South to North


Maxwell Street Express - West Pullman - Bone-In Pork Chop Sandwich 

Marinated and seasoned tenderized griddle-cooked bone-in pork chop on a bun with yellow mustard, caramelized onions, and two large sport peppers on the side. Served with fresh hand-cut french fries. 

These sandwiches (and Maxwell Polishes and hot dogs) are served at all the Maxwell street joints on the south side and south suburbs. The very first Maxwell joint, Jim’s Original, was initially located at Maxwell Street Market at Maxwell and Halsted and now resides a block away at 13th and Union. Maxwell Street isn't only the birthplace of the Maxwell Bone-in Pork Chop Sandwich and Maxwell Polish, but also Chicago Blues. Electrified for the first time at the open-air market so it could be heard over the loud noise of the bargain hunters. Some statues of blues musicians and a couple of Maxwell Polish restaurants are the only evidence of this storied history. You can still taste Maxwell Street here and smell it for a few blocks around. The smell wafts across the Dan Ryan, so roll down your window next time you are passing by; you will be experiencing the smell of a bygone Chicago. 

Maxwell Street Express, open 24 hours, at 116th and Halsted stands out amongst them all for their fast and friendly service, a very tender pork chop that tugs easily off the bone, perfectly caramelized onions, and delicious fresh hand-cut fries. 


Home of the Hoagie - Morgan Park - Steak Sandwich 

They call it ‘A Meal on a Bun!” Chopped griddle-cooked ribeye steak, melted American cheese, grilled onions, and sweet peppers drenched in a secret sweet and tangy sauce, piled on top of a steamed bun and topped with giardiniera and sliced tomatoes.

Much like the Illinois Secretary of State’s Office, this place has a reputation for long lines and wait times. Wait in a long line in the middle lane to place your order. After being given a numbered ticket, you then move to a separate line in the right lane and wait to hand in your ticket and pay in cash only. They staple your numbered ticket to a receipt and you then, similar to the 99th and King Drive Secretary of State, move to the rows of chairs off to the side where you sit and wait many minutes for your number to be called to pick up your food from the left lane and head out the door because it is carryout only. The entire process takes about an hour. Even people who phone in their orders should expect long wait times. Maybe Jesse White can consult them on a more efficient process. The place is a Southside staple and has been around for over 55 years for good reason. Their meal on a bun is delicious. If you have a free afternoon to wait for a delicious sandwich, this is the place for you.


Nicky V’s - Mt. Greenwood - Breaded Steak Sandwich 

Thinly-pounded fried skirt steak bathed in red gravy with melted mozzarella cheese and giardiniera on a Turano french roll.

Nicky V’s owner, Nick Versetto, has been very busy opening restaurants on the Southside and south suburbs over the past few years. He started in Oak Forest, then opened in Mt. Greenwood at 111th and Pulaski, and has recently opened restaurants in Merrionette Park, Bedford Park, and New Lenox (some with drive-thrus for those on the go). He will even take his restaurant to you in his Nicky V’s food truck. Nicky V’s serves probably the best depression dog on the Southside. They serve burgers, pizza puffs, gyros, Italian Beefs, but also some deep cuts such as the Mother-in-law and the Breaded Steak Sandwich. The Breaded Steak Sandwich was popularized by Ricobene’s, receiving praise from Anthony Bourdain and declared the “best sandwich in the world” by USA Today. Nicky V’s sandwich is just as good and just as messy. They supply you with about 25 napkins when you order this sandwich and you will use most of them as you bathe in its rich red gravy while you devour this delectable delight.


Nicky’s of Beverly - Beverly - Gyros Sandwich

Lamb gyros shaved off the spit onto a fresh pita topped with tzatziki, lettuce, and tomato.

When I first moved into Beverly, I asked a neighbor where I could get a good gyros sandwich in the neighborhood. He directed me to Nicky’s which has been my go-to for a good gyros ever since. Originally located at 103rd and Western, they have since moved to a new location and have built a modern architecturally interesting shipping container addition and a beautiful patio. Most neighborhoods in Chicago have a joint that serves a good hot dog and a good gyros. In my neighborhood, it is Nicky’s. If you go to a place and you see a rotating cylinder of ground lamb, they will most likely serve up a good gyros sandwich and if you see a Vienna Beef sign, pair it with a hot dog.


Nicky’s of Beverly - Beverly - Pepper and Egg Sandwich 

Green bell peppers, scrambled egg, and melted mozzarella cheese on a French roll.

This sandwich is popular in Chicago fast food joints during Lent when Chicago Catholics abstain from eating flesh meat on Fridays because Jesus sacrificed His flesh on Good Friday. Catholic doctrine does not require abstinence from drinking alcohol during Lent so feel free to pair that Pepper and Egg with a drink. They have a rotating selection of craft beers on tap - many brewed on the south side, wine, and craft cocktails.


Nicky’s of Beverly - Beverly - Lobster Roll

Tender chunks of hot, buttery knuckle and claw lobster and chives tucked into a toasted split-top bun with a side of chips and a pickle.

There are probably 10 more sandwiches from Nicky’s that I could include on this list. For the pescatarian, you really can’t go wrong with Nicky’s Lobster Roll sandwich. A Lobster Roll is not easy to find in Chicago and theirs is delicious. I like to take this sandwich to the patio and pair it with a local IPA that Nicky’s has on tap. Nicky’s takes Chicago street food and elevates it by offering options such as this that you wouldn’t normally find in your average Chicago fast food joint.


Calabria - Beverly - The Stenger Sandwich

Choice of homemade meatballs, beef, or sausage stuffed in a Mariano bread topped with garlic spread with provolone cheese and homemade red sauce. Homemade potato chips on the side.

This Italian deli on 103rd just steps from the Rock Island station offers imported Italian meats, cheeses, groceries, homemade Italian sausage, and hot and cold meals to go or to eat in their dining room. If you are lucky, you might catch some live music while you are there. My last time there, I was entertained by a live jazz trio while being served at the deli counter. Pat Roberto, owner, is really proud of The Stenger Sandwich. He told me that he usually orders his sandwich half meatball and half Italian Beef. That's a good way to eat it. They pull out the soft bread insides and stuff in the meat. For someone like me who has unsteady hands and a small mouth, this sandwich keeps everything tidy inside the crusty bread, fully enveloped in its crusty bread until the end. Only one napkin is needed.


Calabria - Beverly - The Original Freddy Sandwich

Spicy sausage patty, sweet peppers, melted mozzarella cheese, and homemade red sauce. Homemade potato chips on the side.

Just like Nicky’s of Beverly, Calabria offers a long list of excellent sandwiches from cold deli sandwiches to hot sandwiches from their kitchen. The Original Freddy isn’t the prettiest of sandwiches but don’t judge a book by its cover. The combination of homemade italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, and homemade red sauce on fresh french bread makes my mouth water just thinking about  it.


Afro Joe’s - Beverly - South Side Short Rib Grilled Cheese

Cheddar cheese, sourdough bread, Coca-Cola braised short ribs, and pickled onions grilled to perfection.

Kendall and Aisha Griffin opened their coffee shop and eatery in 2000 in Auburn Gresham and moved to the Beverly neighborhood just a few steps away from the 99th Rock Island station in 2002. Their mission is to “build community through coffee, art, children’s literacy, and supporting Black maternal health.” The space went from a car mechanic to a garden store to a coffee shop in the last few years but judging by how vibrant Afro Joe’s is whenever I am there, I think Kendall and Aisha will be in this space for a while. The place is always busy because the coffee is good, the food is delicious, and the environment is comfortable and welcoming. They have a nice patio for al fresco dining in the summer with a special “barking lot” for doggos. The Short Rib Grilled Cheese uses quality ingredients including Publican bread. The sweet meat, salty cheese, and tangy pickled onion makes a delicious well-balanced sandwich.


Afro Joe’s - Beverly - The Bronzeville Breakfast Sandwich

Fried egg, cheddar cheese, chipotle mayo, brioche bun, choice of turkey sausage, bacon, or avocado.

This sandwich made the list of WBEZ’s “10 best breakfast sandwiches in Chicago for a persnickety morning commuter.” For a breakfast sandwich, you don’t need to make it complicated, just a few simple fresh ingredients cooked just right and that is what the Bronzeville Sandwich is.  I prefer sausage as a protein on my breakfast sandwich. It is packed with protein to power me through my day. If you live in the neighborhood and about to get on the train, get the Bronzeville Sandwich and a cup of joe to go. Thanks, Afro Joe.



Flippin Flavors - Beverly - Flippin Super Steak Philly Sandwich

Sirloin steak, provolone cheese, onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms served on grilled buttered french bread with mayo.

Brian and Linda Flippin originally started their business selling homemade jerk marinade and opened their restaurant on 95th Street in 2020. It was not the best year for opening a restaurant but their success has been sustained by serving up an excellent product. They serve hoagies, cheesesteaks and salads. I have been to Philadelphia only once so I am no expert on Philly Cheesesteaks. What they serve up at Flippin Flavors


Famous Grill - Auburn Gresham - Jim Shoe Sandwich

Griddle cooked Italian Beef, Gyros, and Corned Beef topped with lettuce, tomato, mayo, giardiniera on a lightly griddle-toasted buttered French bread.

This carryout joint is located adjacent to a Citgo gas station at 85th and Ashland. Some graphic artist really went wild decorating the inside and outside of this fast food palace. The place is covered from head to toe with pictures of their menu listings and these offerings are a sight to behold. These types of restaurants are scattered around the south side. Your food is presented to you through a bullet proof lazy Susan. They offer a combination of burgers, Phillies, Krispy Phillies, gyros, Jim Shoes (also spelled Gym Shoe and Jim Shoo), burritos, tacos, beefs, subs, melts, sausages, pita sandwiches...They even offer a ""Jim Shoo Salad"" for the calorie-conscious consumer. These match-makers will pair up any random combination to form an unholy matrimony of fast food and I would try every one of these devilish amalgamations. A fast food enthusiast could eat a different meal here every day for a year and still not get through their entire menu. Turkey Patty Melt, Chicken Sandwich with Gyros Meat, Gym Shoe Burrito, Italian Beef Burrito, Super Taco on Pita... There are no bounds at Famous Grill; the combinations are endless.

I watched the chef cook my Shoe. He buttered French bread and lightly toasted it on the flat top then added chopped hot Italian beef, gyros, and corned beef meat, topped it with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and giardinera, and neatly wrapped into its tight paper pouch. Best Jim Shoe I’ve ever eaten!


Tony’s Italian Beef - Westlawn - Italian Beef (hot, sweet, and wet)

Simmered-in-gravy thinly shaved homemade thinly Italian Beef piled on a fresh Turano French bread baptized in gravy and topped with sweet green peppers and Grandpa Tony’s homemade giardiniera.

“When was the last time you had a really good sandwich!” is inscribed outside this restaurant. A question written as an exclamatory sentence. To serve the best Italian Beef in Chicago is like being Michael Jordan or Walter Payton. These guys are the Italian Beef GOATs. I like my beef hot, sweet, and wet.


Amer’s Deli - Greater Grand Crossing - Smoked Turkey Hoagie

Smoked turkey breast, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, mustard, mayo, and giardiniera on fresh in-house-baked crusty bread.

Along with groceries, auto supplies, gloves, hats, snacks and other standard gas station fare, the Citgo at 67th and State has a deli counter. Place your order with the cashier behind the the bullet-proof plexi and bring the receipt over to Amer’s Deli and wait for your order to go. Amer bakes his crusty hoagie bread in-house (in-station). Amer does good business in the Citgo. The place is buzzin’ because the food is bussin’.


Ain’t She Sweet Cafe - Bronzeville - Jerk Salmon Wrap

Grilled jerk salmon, lettuce, tomato, red onion, spicy homemade jerk sauce, and cheddar-jack cheese.

Ain’t She Sweet has two locations; one in Bronzeville and the other in Beverly. They offer soups, salads, sandwiches, sweets, and more. I like their wrap sandwiches with a choice of flour, wheat, spinach, or tomato basil tortilla especially the Jerk Chicken Wrap. Their jerk and blackened salmon are especially good. 


Ricobene’s - Armour Square - Chicken Vesuvio Sandwich

Thinly-pounded fried breaded chicken cutlet dipped in garlic butter, served on a French roll with lettuce, tomato, onions, and mayo.

Ricobene’s does everything right and they are open late. This is a regular stop for me if I am looking for a late-night sandwich. They are best known for their breaded steak sandwich, having been featured by Anthony Bourdain and declared the “best sandwich in the world” by USA Today. It is a great sandwich but I don’t always feel like bathing in red gravy and drying myself off with 20 napkins. I think the Chicken Vesuvio Sandwich is the unsung hero here. It is a much neater sandwich and equally delicious.

My mind catches up, I am alone. They could have gotten in through many of the unsecured windows. I take note to curse my stupidity later.

I look at the chord leading to the wall. I had not switched it on. I make another note to curse my stupidity.

The rolling pin.

It is tucked away under the mattress. I reach for it carefully, my eyes focused on the crack at the door base; my ears working at full capacity.

No flashlights, just darkness out there.

The footsteps are erratic… fast and then stop.

A vision of a dilapidated junkie flashes in my mind.   Long blonde scraggy hair, small sinewy body, desperate for quick cash.. I don’t have much but - maybe to a junkie - it is enough.

Would they come in here? They would see me and what would I do? Pretend to sleep and hope for the best? Let them take our stuff?

Dale would be disappointed, he loves his XBox and we don’t have insurance. I could feel his blame when he comes home in a week.

I hear a thump and the coffee table squeak; like someone has run into it.

My body moves to the door, I hear my warrior cry as I swing it open, rolling pin above my head.

There is nothing, just darkness.

I flick on the light switch surveying the room.

No person, no noise.

I look down a little and see two sets of tiny frightened eyes.

A mother possum with a baby on her back. Both are frozen in fear.

The rolling pin comes down to my side with a soft laugh. I could just turn out the light, close my door and go back to bed.

But - I am responsible for the house, I have to shoo them away. For christs-sake! My mother used to sweep snakes out of our house.

If she can calmly sweep serpents away, I can get these possums out.

I open the front door, make room and gesture for them to leave. They stay in place, wide eyes watching me.

I make a wide berth and grab a broom. I make pushing motions towards them in the aim to scare them towards the door.

Instead, the mother possum panics, runs onto the couch and jumps out the window; a three meter drop at least.

I hear the thud.

Oh no! I hope the baby is ok!

I don’t hear anything else.

I quietly creep to the window.

I don’t want to see.

What if they are hurt?!

Possums are natural climbers, but the baby is so small…

I have to look and know. There is no way I could sleep with the image the baby, hurt and needing help.

I poke my head out looking down. There is nothing there.

I take that as a good sign.

They made it!

The house is quiet and dark again.

I close the windows and finally settle down for sleep, body resting, my thoughts wondering what it would be like to be a possum; fearless of the dark, brave, maternal.

I bargain that I can look it up tomorrow.

I never did.

The end.

Any feedback would be useful please?

1q0w0bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/writersmakingfriends/comments/1q0w0bn/fight_of_a_lifetime/,Fight of a Lifetime,"Wildlife was never a mystery to me. I lived far too much wild life as an adult, and had more experience with critters as a child than most kids outside of Elly May Clampett. I think I’ve mentioned an owl we had for a bit to eliminate our huge rat problem as a child. Opossums, tarantulas, very large snakes, giant turtles, and the occasional stray mama cat to go with the gift my family always had (except one particular girl) to always find our home being shared with some downright brilliant canines. Those animals are fine and enshrined in all of our memories. I could not find an antonym for “enshrined” when looking for a description of the animal that I waged one of the greatest wars in my life against.

Karl and I were living in Heritage Pointe Apartments on Hargrove, across the street from Doc’s Food and Spirits (the scene of some later wild life of mine). Neither of us was very tidy, but Karl was worse. In the previous apartment we rented, I was helping him pack his bedroom when I came across a plate on the floor of old chicken bones that became an ashtray for him that started from one of our first ever nights there, 6 months prior. The rest of the apartment, I could get into shape sometimes, unlike our previous abode. I was walking home from work one night when I passed an empty 50-gallon trash can on some rollers. I snagged that up, and we put it in the big walk-in pantry-closet at the far side of the kitchen. It had rollers, but we were on the 2nd floor, so the trash would very rarely get emptied. It led to a pretty damned big roach supply that I found annoying to various degrees.

I’d be lying in my bed, waiting for sleep, next to my open bedroom door, when I’d see a roach walking down the wall of the hall through the doorway. I’d lie there just hoping he would continue his jaunt on past my line of vision so that I wouldn’t be forced to get up, grab a shoe, and kill him. He’d get almost out of sight, do a circle or two, then head back to the other side of the door before he’d do a circle and go back in his original direction. This was happening one night when I reached over for a swallow of some sweetened tea next to my bed, swallowing a roach that I could then feel flipping and circling somewhere in my gut for a minute. My annoyance turned into something else.

I got up and walked directly to the Kroger for some weapons. Hot Shot was the weapon I chose, and it turned out to be the best gun I’ve ever had. In that old commercial, you’d see someone spray a bug from a good distance, and the bug would explode like a Star Wars TIE fighter. Our visitors didn’t explode, but the Hot Shot fired an accurate stream about 30 feet out. My bedroom door issue would no longer be a problem. The commercial conveyed the proper message.

I took the Hot Shot into the pantry-closet to spray the big can, then started moving things back off of the shelves when I uncovered a very large ball of roaches behind some things. I fired my Hot Shot into the eye of that compact storm, causing it to quickly develop into some sort of hurricane enveloping the entire room, with every roach running for its life. I continued my spray as they covered every wall and the ceiling of the room, falling onto the floor, into the 50-gallon can, and all over me, who had very recently swallowed one and felt it trying to climb back out of me. Things were **on** at that point.

The apartment building we were in was far from nice, and we had an Asian family next door that would barbecue dogs and cats. Mexicans, while generally clean, had moved wholesale into the area and would sleep about 12 to a unit. There was a laundry/ storage facility at the bottom of the lower breezeway stairs that held a few good places for them to congregate, and I sought out every one of them. I’d probably spent two solid weeks scrounging in and around the enclosed building and those around us, looking for more roaches to kill, when I began to miss them from the good old days, when I’d keep a bag of rubber bands on the coffee table for a friend who could twist a band around his fingers like a gun and pop them off of walls from across the living room at will. I never got that good at it.

I’ve had homes that beach crabs liked and homes that had constant gecko life on the walls. I had to keep a good eye out for scorpions when my son was a baby, and had a place that I woke up to with sore fingers until I saw the spiders that lived between the wall and the part of my mattress where my hands would be when sleeping, but nothing wriggled its way down my throat. I never saw a roach in those apartments again. I intend to keep things clean enough not to provide any breeding ground for them. But if I see one, I have already identified some possible bases and I know just the gun I’ll use.

1q0vytv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0vytv,OXI Logo & Brand Identity Design,"OXI Logo & Brand Identity Design
A Sports Space Integrated with Coffee and Lush Green Terrariums 🌿

When I first started working on the OXI project, I didn’t see it as a single brand, but rather as a living ecosystem. OXI brings together different components such as OXI Badminton, OXI Garden, OXI Coffee and OXI Shop, all revolving around the shared spirit of “Năng lượng Xanh, hoà nhịp Sống,” which can be understood as “Green Energy, Living in Harmony.”

Because of that, my main priority throughout the design process was to build a tightly connected visual identity system. The logo needed to be cohesive enough to unify all sub brands, while still remaining flexible so each space could express its own personality. OXI Badminton embodies movement and athletic energy. OXI Garden offers a calm and slow paced retreat surrounded by greenery. OXI Coffee serves as a pause, a place to relax and recharge inspiration.

The core logo was developed from the OXI letterform, integrated with an infinity symbol. To me, this was the most intuitive way to express the idea of continuous circulation and energy renewal. I imagine OXI as a destination where, after long and exhausting work hours, people can come to move their bodies, breathe among green spaces, sit down with a cup of coffee, and leave feeling mentally lighter and physically re energized.

In terms of color, I chose a neon green tone as the primary color of the logo, representing energy, vitality and excitement. From there, supporting colors such as blue, brown and deep green were developed for each sub brand, maintaining a consistent OXI spirit while creating visual experiences that fit the character of each space.",4,1767242784.0,logodesign,4,0.75,False

Olalla Polar Bear Plunge (South Kitsap)

The most informal (and possibly boldest) plunge. Locals gather at Olalla Bay and jump in when the tide is right. Expect crowds, roadside parking, a warming fire, and start times that depend entirely on the water doing what it needs to do. Watch for local updates before heading out.

Bainbridge Island Polar Bear Plunge

Thursday, January 1, at noon

Lytle Beach, at the end of Lytle Road near Pleasant Beach. A classic island-style plunge with limited parking nearby, so plan to walk a bit and arrive early.

Wildcat Lake Prance & Plunge (Silverdale area)

Thursday, January 1

A 5K run around Wildcat Lake starting at 10 a.m., followed by an optional plunge into the lake, snacks, and warming up by the fire. Starts and finishes at Wildcat Lake Park. A registration fee is requested to support park operations.

Brownsville Polar Plunge (Central Kitsap)

Thursday, January 1

Breakfast and refreshments start at 10:30 a.m., plunge at noon near Brownsville Marina. This one’s more of a wade-and-run situation and benefits Fishline in Poulsbo. Donation for breakfast is encouraged.

Whether you’re plunging, cheering from shore, or just watching from a safe distance with coffee and a blanket, this is one of those very Kitsap ways to start the year.

How augmented will it be?,"I've been thinking about how future technology might change our perceptions very drastically. If you look at the present day, a lot of our perceptions and ideas are derived from digital media and digital content. I would say that we've gone from scanning our environment and exploring physical space; to scanning the digital realm and exploring dopamine inducing content or philosophy/ideas.

  
I wonder in the future how will we experience things, for example now we can organize things much faster, I can find a date on Tinder within 5 minutes, order my coffee remotely, organize services at home; and in some cases instantly reject services or commitments I've made.

  
In the future rather than making a Facebook group for 'going on long walks', perhaps technology will read your body and your posts/content you consume, detect that you want to walk, detect that you want to be sociable and pair you up with someone who is a minute walk away from you, without you proactively searching for that activity. Our perception of how we use our time and how quickly things can be done may be changed.

  
Virtual reality is another example I can think of, at some stage with advanced computer-brain interfaces, perhaps we'll be able to live in fully simulated worlds. We could visit the Byzantine empire, live in the pokemon world, live in a world in which we are the God of that world in creative mode. Our perception will be inevitably changed something like this, opening us up to new forms of thoughts, combinations of sensations and possibilities. It may even be the case that our processing speed is dramatically increased, meaning we could experience 1000 days in a virtual world, whilst only passing one day on Earth.



Furthermore, how advanced will technology get, if the multiverse/many universes theory is correct, will we be able to teleport to our own customised universe?

Currently 32M and the parents came to visit this week (own my house in a major urban city). My parents have always somewhat treated me as if I am still a child even though I have not been financially supported by them since I left high school (division one scholarship athlete, graduated to a 6 figure job and worked my way up from there). 

  
Tonight my mom was sleeping on the couch while we were watching TV and I asked her if she wanted to go to bed because she was sleeping and she told me to ""Shut the fuck up"" and that ""she was the adult and could go to bed when she wants"". 

I then asked her to take her shoes off the coffee table (she was wearing them and reclining her feet), to which she does what she always does, brings up the fact that when I was a kid I always messed up her stuff. 

Totally fair to point out my flaws as a child, but what seems unreasonable is using that to punish me and my fiancee's things 25 years down the line. 

I am at the point where I want to tell her that if she cannot respect me and treat me as a fully-functioning adult, she is no longer welcome at our wedding in May and I will no longer speak to her. Not sure if anyone has been through this with a super narcissistic parent before, but please let me know.

For a few seconds, I was convinced that I could just stay there. That if I stayed really still and didn’t leave the bed, the day wouldn’t start yet. The ceiling above my bed has a faint crack running from the corner toward the light fixture. I have watched it long enough to know exactly where it fades out. I don’t remember when I noticed it the first time. Just that it has always been there when I needed something to stare at.

I hit snooze.

When the alarm went off again, that was the one I actually woke up to. Not because it was louder, just because by then the math had already settled in. If I didn’t get up now, I would be late. If I were late, I would lose the overtime hours. If I lost the overtime, the bills wouldn’t line up the way I needed them to. I sighed and sat up. The floor was cold. I noticed that immediately. I always do.

I shuffled into the kitchen and hit the coffee maker without really looking at it. I had set it up the night before. Grounds measured. Water filled. Like a small gift to my future groggy self. The coffee finished brewing while I leaned against the counter and waited. It smelled fine. Not good. Not bad. Just enough caffeine to keep me conscious while I stared at a screen for the next eight hours. I grabbed the same chipped mug I’ve had since college. The handle is a little loose now. I keep meaning to replace it. I never do.

As I watched the coffee pot finish, it reminded me of a different kitchen for a moment. Smaller. Messier. Too many people packed into it at once. Back when coffee meant staying up late on purpose. I was in college then. I remember thinking I was exhausted all the time, which now seems funny. I had no idea what tired actually felt like yet. I drank terrible coffee back then too. Burnt. Too strong. Always cold by the time I finished it. But it felt different. It felt like fuel. I had plans then. Not big cinematic ones. Just enough to feel like I was moving toward something. I remember sitting in a lecture hall one morning, half asleep, writing ideas in the margins of my notebook instead of taking notes. Nothing concrete. Just possibilities. I thought I would figure things out as I went. I truly believed that. I believed effort mattered. That showing up would eventually turn into momentum. That if I kept trying, even badly, something would open up. I don’t remember what I thought that something was. Just that it felt close.

The coffee maker clicked off, and the sound pulled me back. Same kitchen. Same counter. Same mug with the loose handle. I took a sip. It tasted fine.

I don’t think that version of me was wrong. I think they just didn’t know how long eventually could be. Standing there in my kitchen, holding mediocre coffee, I didn’t feel bitter. I felt patient. Like maybe I hadn’t missed my chance. Like things don’t stop being fixable just because they take longer than you expected. While the coffee cooled, I checked my phone. No messages. No missed calls. Just the usual reminders. Payments due. Pending. Overdue. I have gotten a few disconnect warnings over the past couple of months. Nothing serious yet. Still fixable. That is what mattered right now. Everything was still fixable.

“I am not unhappy.”

I needed to say it out loud. I think people confuse tired with miserable. I have a job. It’s not exciting, but it is stable. I have an apartment. It is small, but it is quiet. I can pay most of my bills on time. The rest, I am working on. Some days, when I let myself think about it, I actually believe things could get better. Not dramatically. Not all at once. Just incrementally. I rinsed out the mug and set it upside down in the rack. The handle wobbled. I adjusted it.

Riley was already on the bus when I got on, sitting in the same seat by the window. She glanced up from her phone and smiled. “You’ re cutting it close,” she said. “Still counts,” I told her. She hummed like she agreed. The ride passed quietly. Riley pointed out a new sign someone had put up near the corner store. A dog stubbornly refusing to walk. Small things. The kind you only notice when you have someone to notice them with. We got off at the stop near work and walked the last block together.

By the time we reached the parking lot, the others were already there. Julian stood a little apart, leaning against his car, watching the building like he always did. Caleb leaned against his car with a cup of coffee in hand. “Morning,” he said when he saw me. “Morning.” Paige’s car pulled in a little too fast, brakes squeaking as she slid into her usual spot. She jumped out, keys already in hand, hair still damp like she had rushed out the door. “Don’t start,” she said immediately, pointing at us before anyone could speak. “I wasn’t going to say anything,” Riley replied. “I was just going to look at you like this.” She crossed her arms and tilted her head dramatically. “Traffic,” Paige said. “Every day,” Julian added. “Same road. Same time.” “Yeah,” Paige said. “But today it was personal.”

I smiled without realizing I was doing it.

Caleb stood the way he always did. Relaxed without looking careless. Coffee cup held low, like it was part of the morning rather than something he needed. Julian stayed a step apart from the rest of us, hands in his pockets, eyes moving more than his body. Like he was already paying attention to something the rest of us hadn’t noticed yet. Paige never fully stopped moving. Even now, she shifted her weight, keys tight in her hand, hair pulled back too quickly to be intentional. Riley leaned into the moment without effort. Arms crossed loosely. Expression already halfway into a joke. She caught my eye and lifted her brows, like she saw me noticing. For a second, everything felt exactly where it was supposed to be.

Caleb took a sip of his coffee. “Anyone else think the break room coffee tastes worse when you’re already tired?” “That implies it tasted good at some point,” Julian said. “It’s not coffee,” Riley said. “It is brown encouragement.”

We all laughed. Not loud. Not forced. The kind of laugh that just happens. We stood there a few seconds longer than we needed to. No one said we were waiting. No one had to. There used to be more of us. Not all at once. One at a time. Different reasons. Different exits.

Ethan didn’t move away. Not really. He just started missing things. Then avoiding them. Then choosing work over us in a sense that felt deliberate instead of necessary. We told ourselves it was temporary. He told us it was. Eventually it stopped feeling like distance and started feeling like a decision. Grace got busy in a way that made everything else fall to the side. Archer just drifted. No argument. No goodbye. Just fewer replies until there weren’t any. Not everyone faded out quietly. One of them left, and the sound lingered. We said things we cannot unsay. And then we stopped saying anything at all.

We don’t talk about that one. We don’t need to.

Paige checked the time. We all did the same. Habit. “Alright,” she said with a sigh. “Let us go make money.” We split off toward the building. Different doors. Same place. Work passed the way it usually does. Emails. Meetings. A box of stale, store bought donuts someone brought in because it was their turn. At the end of the day, I felt tired but not empty. The good kind of tired. The kind that makes you believe rest will help.

That night, lying in the dark, I thought about the people I had stood with that morning. Riley came first, the way she usually did. She had a way of pointing things out that made the world feel bigger instead of heavier. Like there were still options I hadn’t exhausted yet. She talked about possibilities the way other people talked about weather. Casual. Inevitable. Worth noticing. Paige was harder to pin down, mostly because she never put herself in the center of anything. She just kept track. Of people. Of moods. Of when someone hadn’t shown up in a while. If the group felt steady, it was usually because she had adjusted something quietly without asking for credit. Julian noticed things before the rest of us did. Not in a dramatic way. Just small inconsistencies. Tiny patterns that didn’t quite line up. He didn’t always share what he saw, but when he did, it was because it mattered. I trusted his silences almost as much as his words.

And then there was Caleb.

Caleb was steady, dependable to a fault. The kind of person who made plans and followed through. The kind who stayed where he said he would. He didn’t talk much about the future, but when he did, it sounded like something that could actually happen.

I trusted them. All of them. In different ways. That felt important. I didn’t know why. I stared at the ceiling for a while longer, tracing the familiar crack with my eyes. Then I rolled onto my side, pulled the blanket up to my chin, and let the day go. Whatever tomorrow was going to be, I would deal with it when it arrived. For now, this was enough.

By the time Riley and I reached the parking lot the next morning, most of the others were already there. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building without really looking at it. Caleb leaned against his car, scrolling through his phone, coffee balanced easily in one hand. Paige was pacing a short line between two parked cars, like she had something she was waiting to say. “Hey,” Riley greeted everyone, lifting her hand as we approached. “Morning,” I said. Paige turned toward us immediately. “Okay. News.” That was enough to pull everyone’s attention in at once.

“Two people in my department got promoted,” she said. “Officially. New titles. Better pay.” Riley blinked. “Already? Didn’t they just restructure?” “That is what I thought,” Paige said. “But apparently they’re fast tracking some positions” she shrugged. Caleb glanced up from his phone. “They’ve been quietly posting internal listings for weeks.” He turned his phone to show the group. Julian nodded once. “I noticed that too.”

I hadn’t.

Paige looked at me. “I thought of you when I heard.” Something in my chest lifted before I could stop it. “Me?” I asked. “Yeah,” she said. “You would be perfect for something like that. You already do half of what those roles require.” Riley smiled at me like it was obvious. “She’s not wrong, ya know.” I laughed, a little embarrassed, but I didn’t deflect the way I usually would. I let the thought sit there for a second.

Maybe. The word felt dangerous and exciting all at once.

“That would be nice,” I said. And I meant it. Caleb met my eyes briefly, then nodded. “It would.” We stood there a few seconds longer than necessary, the way we always did. No one rushing. No one checking the time yet. Eventually, Paige sighed and glanced at her watch. “Alright. If we don’t go in now, I am going to be late for something I already don’t want to be at.” “Fiiiiineeeee,” Riley said with an over exaggerated sigh. We laughed, and then we split off toward the building. Still different doors. Still the same place.

The building felt the same as it always did when I walked in. Same fluorescent hum. Same muted conversations drifting down the hallway. Nothing about the place looked different. But it felt different. I caught myself paying closer attention than usual. Listening in meetings instead of just attending them. Noticing which names came up when people talked about new projects or upcoming shifts. I didn’t push myself forward. I also didn’t shrink back.

At my desk, I opened my email and scanned through the usual messages. Deadlines. Reminders. A calendar invite I had already half forgotten about. And then I saw it. An internal posting. Nothing flashy. Just a quiet line in the subject header about role expansion and departmental support. Normally, I would have archived it without thinking. Instead, I opened it. The description felt familiar. Responsibilities I already handled. Skills I had picked up over time without ever really naming them. The kind of work that didn’t feel like a stretch so much as a shift. I re-read it twice before I realized I was smiling. I didn’t apply. Not yet. But I bookmarked it. That felt like something.

Later, in a meeting that usually faded into the background, someone asked a question that no one answered right away. I found myself speaking up before I had talked myself out of it. My voice didn’t shake. No one looked surprised. The conversation moved on, but something lingered.

At lunch, Paige stopped by my desk under the pretense of borrowing a pen. “You look different today,” she said. “Different how?” I asked. She smiled. “Like you’re thinking about something.” I shrugged, but I didn’t deny it. Riley sent me a message a little later. Nothing important. Just a joke about the vending machine eating her money again. I laughed out loud before I realized I was doing it. The afternoon passed more quickly than usual. By the time my shift ended, I wasn’t exhausted in the way I normally was. I felt alert. Like I had leaned forward instead of bracing myself. Walking out of the building, I caught my reflection in the glass doors. I looked the same. But something underneath felt newly awake. I didn’t know what I was going to do with that yet. But for the first time in a while, it felt like a choice.

The bus was quieter on the way back. Most people stared at their phones or leaned their heads against the windows, the day already starting to drain out of them. Riley sat beside me like she always did, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling without really looking at anything. “You were happier today,” she said after a while. “Was I?” She nodded. “In a subtle thinking way. Not a bad way.” I watched the city slide past the window. Storefronts I recognized. Corners I could name without trying. “I think Paige might be right,” I said finally. Riley glanced at me. “About the promotion thing?” “Yeah.” She smiled, not surprised. “I told you.” I huffed softly. “You always do.” “That is because you always forget,” she said, nudging my knee lightly with hers. I thought about the posting. The bookmark. The way it had felt to speak up in that meeting without rehearsing it in my head first. “I didn’t apply,” I said. “I know.” I looked at her. “How?” “You would have told me if you did,” she said. “Or you would be panicking right now.” That was true. The bus slowed at our stop. “But,” Riley added as we stood, “you are thinking about it. And that counts.” I nodded. It did.

Paige lived in a small duplex not too far from work, the kind of place that always smelled faintly like whatever she had cooked last. When Riley and I arrived, the lights were already on and the door was unlocked. “Shoes off,” Paige called from the kitchen before we even announced ourselves. Caleb was already there, sitting at the table with a drink in his hand, sleeves rolled up like he had been helping with something. Julian leaned against the counter nearby, watching Paige move around the kitchen like he was cataloging it.

“You’re late,” Paige said, but she smiled when she said it. “We took the scenic route,” Riley replied. “There is no scenic route,” Paige said. “Exactly.”

We settled in the way we always did. Someone claimed the couch. Someone else grabbed an extra chair from the corner. Plates were passed around without asking. Conversation overlapped and doubled back on itself. At some point, Caleb handed me a drink I hadn’t asked for. “Figured,” he said with a shrug, a warm smile and a slight wink. “Thanks.” Julian asked a question that turned into a debate. Paige disappeared and came back with more food. Riley kicked her feet up onto the coffee table like she owned the place. I sat there and let it happen. At one point, Paige looked around the room and sighed, content. “I like this,” she said. “We should keep doing this even when work gets stupid.” “When?” Riley echoed. “Work is already stupid.” “True,” Paige conceded. I laughed, and it surprised me how easy it felt.

Later, when the night wound down and people started checking the time, I helped Paige stack plates in the sink. “You okay?” she asked quietly. “Yeah,” I said. “I think I am.” She nodded like that answer made sense.

Walking home later, the air felt cooler. Lighter. I didn’t know what the next step was yet. But for the first time, it felt like I didn’t have to take it alone.

Saturday passed more slowly than I expected. I cleaned my apartment in pieces, starting and stopping whenever something else caught my attention. Laundry sat folded on the couch longer than it needed to. Dishes dried in the rack while I stood there, staring at them without really seeing them.

At some point in the afternoon, I opened my laptop. I didn’t mean to look for anything specific. I just did. The post was still bookmarked.

I hovered over it for a second before clicking.

It looked the same as it had on Friday. Same title. Same careful language. Same list of responsibilities that felt uncomfortably familiar.

**Position: Operations Support Coordinator**

**Division: Internal Systems and Continuity**

**Posting Type: Internal Expansion**

The listing was hosted on Axiom’s internal board, but the footer carried a smaller line of attribution that I didn’t remember seeing before.

^(“)*^(Reviewed in alignment with First Principle Collective.”)*

The description was short. Careful. Almost intentionally plain.

**^(“Provide operational support across multiple departments during periods of transition. Maintain documentation and process consistency to reduce workflow disruption. Assist in identifying gaps, redundancies, and unresolved escalations. Act as a liaison between teams when responsibilities overlap or stall.”)**

There wasn’t anything flashy about it. No promises. No urgency. Just quiet expectations. The qualifications were worse.

**^(“Demonstrates reliability and follow through. Strong written communication and organizational awareness. Ability to work independently with minimal oversight. Comfort operating in evolving or undefined structures.”)**

I read that last line twice. I had been doing most of this already. Not officially. Not because anyone had asked. Just because things tended to fall apart if no one did. At the bottom of the posting, separated by a thin gray line, was a final note.

*^(Qualified candidates may be identified internally based on observed performance and organizational need.)*

I imagined what it would be like to do that work officially instead of incidentally. To have it recognized. To stop feeling like I was quietly proving myself to people who didn’t know they were watching. I opened a blank document. Just in case. I typed my name at the top.

*“Nicole Bennett.”*

I stared at it for what felt like hours, until a dog outside barked and snapped me back. I closed the document.

On Sunday, I tried again. This time I told myself I was just practicing. That there was no pressure. That no one would see it unless I wanted them to. I sat at my kitchen table with a mug of reheated coffee and pulled the posting up again. I reread the qualifications, nodding along like I was agreeing with something obvious.

I started drafting a message. Nothing formal. Just a note.

*“Interest expressed. Experience mentioned. Confidence implied.”*

I deleted the first sentence. Then the second. I wrote a third version that sounded too apologetic and erased that one, too. By the time the light outside shifted and the room dimmed, I had rewritten the same paragraph six times. Each version felt wrong in a different way. Too eager. Too cautious. Too confident. Not confident enough. I closed my laptop and walked away from it.

Later that night, curled up on the couch with a blanket pulled over my knees, I opened it again. One last try.

I reread what I had written and imagined hitting send. I imagined the waiting. The wondering. The second guessing every word. I imagined the email being opened by someone who already had a name in mind. My chest tightened. I highlighted the text. Deleted it. Then I closed the posting. Unbookmarked it. I told myself I would think about it again later. Sunday nights are good at that. Convincing you there is always more time. I went to bed telling myself it was fine. That I hadn’t missed anything yet. Monday morning came faster than I expected.

The alarm went off at 6:30, and this time I didn’t hit snooze. I lay there for a few seconds anyway, staring at the ceiling, tracing the familiar crack without really seeing it. My chest felt tight. Not anxious, exactly. Just alert. Like something had already started moving without asking me. I got up and moved through the routine on autopilot. Cold floor. Coffee maker. Same chipped mug. Everything where it was supposed to be. The coffee tasted the same as always.

On the bus, Riley sat beside me, scrolling through her phone with one earbud half in, the way she did when she was open to conversation but not demanding it. The city slid past the windows in a blur of corners and storefronts I could have named without thinking. “You’re quiet,” she said after a while. “I’m fine,” I said. And I meant it. Mostly. She nodded, satisfied, and turned back to her screen. I didn’t open my laptop. I didn’t think about the posting. I told myself that whatever I had felt over the weekend had settled. That I had done the responsible thing by not rushing into something I wasn’t ready for. By the time we got off the bus and walked the last block, the thought felt convincing enough to believe.

The parking lot was already half full. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building with that distant focus of his. Paige was talking animatedly about something that had happened over the weekend, using her hands like punctuation. Caleb leaned against his car, coffee in hand, listening more than he spoke. “Morning,” Riley said as we approached. “Morning,” Paige echoed. “You look awake today.” “Do I?” I asked. She smiled. “More than usual.” I reached into my pocket to check the time. That was when my phone buzzed.

Just once.

I almost ignored it. I expected a calendar reminder. A payment notification. Something automated and impersonal. Instead, I saw an email preview from an internal address I didn’t recognize. The subject line was careful. Neutral.

**Opportunity for Discussion.**

I stopped walking. Riley noticed immediately. “Hey. What’s up?” “I” I started, then stopped. Paige turned toward me, mid sentence. “What is it?” “I think,” I said slowly, looking down at my phone again, “I just got an email I wasn’t expecting.” Julian tilted his head slightly, attention sharpening. Caleb glanced over, then back at my face. “Is that good?” “I don’t know,” I said honestly. The email sat there, unopened. Waiting.

For a second, I thought about Sunday night. About the draft I had deleted. About unbookmarking the posting. About how certain I had felt that I still had time. My thumb hovered over the screen. Then I took a breath. And opened it. The email didn’t load. I tapped it once. Then again. The preview stayed stubbornly vague, replaced by a short line beneath the subject.

**This message must be accessed from a secure workstation.**

I stared at it longer than I should have. Riley leaned in slightly. “What does it say?” “It doesn’t,” I said. “It just won’t open.” Paige frowned. “Like a system error?” “I don’t know,” I said. My mouth felt dry. “It says I have to open it from a secure workstation.” Julian’s brow furrowed. “That’s not that weird. Some system messages are locked like that.” That didn’t help. Caleb tilted his head, studying my face. “You didn’t apply for anything, did you?” “No,” I said immediately. Too quickly. “I didn’t send anything.”Riley looked at me. “Are you sure?” “Yes,” I said. Then, softer, “I’m sure.” Because I was.

I remembered it clearly. Closing the document. Deleting the draft. Unbookmarking the posting. I hadn’t typed anything except my name. My name. A tight, unwelcome thought slid in anyway.

 I want to be at an event for 2-3 hours, I believe I would need 7000-10,500 kWh to be on The safe side right? 

Is it that simple or am I missing something? 

The F3000 is cheaper and rated for 3600W, but not sure if that’s too close to peak wattage? While the F3800 is rated for 6000W. Id like to save money where possible but definitely not at the expense of losing power suddenly during an event.

1q0vmo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1q0vmo3/medical_mystery/,Medical mystery,"38 female with a history of Crohn's disease and PCOS. Have an ileostomy. Was taking occasional Flonase/zyrtec and Afrin to deal with a mild allergy to my dog (sometimes itchy or watery eyes, or like a singular hive on my hand, but mostly nasal swelling at night). No other meds. Have had the end ileostomy for 7 years, had a loop for some years before that (swapped to end due to RV fistula that wouldn't take to repairs). Since mid October I felt as though I was choking on food intermittently. Thought maybe it was reflux.

Early October: had a ""pouchoscopy"" at my gastro (still have a jpouch that's non functional). Given all clear, no active inflammation.

13dec: had MRI with oral and IV contrast in morning to check fistula. Refused glucagon because I don't mess with peristalsis. This came back all clear, nothing new, except a hemorrhagic ovation cyst due to the PCOS. That night I was eating a donut and drinking a coffee and felt like it got stuck in my throat. Mainly left side.

14dec: X-ray at walk in clinic. They saw a mass in front of epiglottitis, sent to hospital. Feel like whatever's stuck is shifting from left side to very base of throat. Worried about airway at one point it feels blocked for three seconds  Hospital does CT, sees mass in front of epiglottitis and air/fluid in thoracic esophagus. Sent to a different hospital that had an ENT. They scope me say the mass and feeling of something stuck is just an enlarged left tonsil and send me home with Omeprazole. From here on switched myself to a soft or liquid diet at home and put Omeprazole over applesauce every morning.

16dec: morning follow up with ENT. Another scope, says my tonsil looks like it's not swollen and since it wasn't sore to me had probably been that big for a while. Says my feeling of something stuck is reflux and will go away. At home I'm monitoring my o2 because I'm scared of losing airway. I note my heart rate is 114ish nearly all day even at rest. Chalk it up to me being nervous. Watching a movie with my husband I suddenly am unable to start a swallow. My body gave the command automatically but couldn't do it which jolted my awareness to manual swallowing. Got a little dizzy. (I had three similar episodes of trouble starting a swallow high heart rate and dizziness in summer 2022 which were called anxiety). Shrugged it off and went to bed.

17dec: woke up to chest pressure. Like that's what woke me. Checked hr, already 95. Weird. Walk to kitchen to feed dog. Heart pounding out of my chest and feel awful. Check hr and it's 170. Call 911. In ambulance they said hr all over the place and something about abnormal p waves. In hospital all ekgs clear. Hr stayed 80-90 when laying down but spiked whenever I'd stand or move. Bp also spike when standing. Had about three bags of fluids and they hung potassium as a precaution but all blood work normal, echo normal, ultrasound of heart normal, troponin normal, no one ever said anything about my telemetry reads so I assume normal. Jaw pain .. so sore suddenly like I had clenched it ..Sent home on metropolol the next day. They said ""maybe it's POTS""

19dec: saw PCP who said it sounds like my nervous system. Told to stop the beta blocker and switch to verapamil. Got super dizzy that night and my BP at home was low. Food starting to feel like it's regurgitating back up to bottom of my throat. Voice hoarse occasionally.

20dec: went to er to take the verapamil as I didn't want to take it far from hospital for the first time in case my BP went low again. Monitored and sent home

22dec: tried to drink water and it immediately shot out my nose. Wouldn't go down. Waited two hours tried to take verapamil, stuck in throat. Back to ER. Ambulance driver confirmed he could see the dye of the pill in my throat. Stabbing pain, burned as dissolved. Er wait so long it dissolved on own and I went home without being seen.

23dec: had a decent day and tolerated a grilled cheese and soup (soaked the bread in the soup ). tried to have home made sloppy Joe for dinner with super fine ground beef no bread. After two tablespoons choked and stopped. 

24dec: throat progressively worse through the morning. Felt like I was choking. Only ate my applesauce with Omeprazole. Called ambulance while driving to hospital. Have been in hospital since this day with high heart rate when moving and sometimes just while resting, constant feeling of something in throat, occasional hoarse voice especially if I'm talking too much, feeling like my throat is ""too big/wide"", this sometimes minty feeling in my throat like it's too open ... Crackle sounds in the back of my throat like pop rocks? Intermittent ear pressure. Past two nights a stuffed nose/swollen nose (food/water going in nose?.. ) definitely burping and hiccuping more than ever in my life. Sometimes burping I can taste food. Definitely regurgitating sometimes. Sometimes have a random head twitch I can't control(very brief one time twitch every few days). Yesterday five minutes after eating my puree/liquid dinner I vomited hard but all that came up was white foam... And I'll be sitting in bed and all of a sudden its like I'm short of breath random times. When this happens I put on my o2 monitor (because for some reason they only check me every 4 hours) reads 93-95% a lot and theirs they only write the highest number not if it's fluctuating while it's on. I've walked to the nurses station and showed them mine and they gave me a nebulizer which helped while I was using it and not shortly after. I had one jolt on my chest that felt like my heart skipped or someone punched me and I literally doubled over.. I had just been sitting quietly in bed. Am now wearing a monitor but it's not recording it's a live feed, and honestly listening to nurses in the hall fill out overstaffed forms so idk if anyone's even watching the thing. Had a smaller jolt feeling earlier tonight but no one came in so idk. Also now having night sweats 

They did a endoscopy and biopsy for EoE and still waiting on results. Second throat CT ""normal"". I'm pushing for manometry. Barium swallow they said they saw ""a little regurgitation"" but then reported as normal (I keep flaring though and this wasnt done during a flare). They ENT scoped me again and said my voice box looked a little irritated. Blood work normal except I asked them to test b12 which was like two points under normal so we started supplements.

Current meds: verapamil, b12, Zyrtec, protonix 

I'm at a loss. Sudden achalasia? What the hell with my heart and breathing? Did I have a stroke? Sort of feels that way. Any insight would be amazing ",1,1767241581.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Woke up in HSR this morning and the street dogs were already in discussion mode. Probably reviewing their 2025. I brushed my teeth and felt like I’d completed my biggest goal for the day.

Went for a walk near Agara Lake because that’s what calm people do, or people pretending to be calm. The lake was peaceful, birds were doing bird things, couples were walking at suspiciously matching speeds. I walked alone with my earphones in, no music playing, just vibes and self-respect.

Sat on a bench for a bit. Watched joggers lap me multiple times. At one point I felt like I should clap. Everyone looked like they had somewhere to be, or someone to walk with. I just adjusted my shoelace twice to feel involved.

Came back home, made coffee, drank it standing in the kitchen like I’m waiting for a meeting invite from life. Opened Zomato, closed it, opened it again. Growth is slow but visible.

Checked a dating app. Saw bios like “here for something real” and “love long walks” while I was literally tired from a short one. Closed the app gently. Abhi main ready nahi hoon.

Now it’s afternoon. HSR is quiet. Agara Lake has moved on. I’m still here, slightly sleepy, oddly peaceful, and fully aware that this is exactly how my year would start.
