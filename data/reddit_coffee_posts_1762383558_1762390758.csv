So if you were Chabad...why then was it like SO important?  Did you guys accept that there was no chance of contamination by non-Kosher animals but just did it anyway because the Rebbe wanted it?  And if so why did you not question the stupidity of it? Or, did you actually believe pig or camel milk made it into the milk aisle or into your coffee creamer or chocolates?

- Getting tattoos instead of listening to my therapist
- Restoring motorcycles like I’m single-handedly reviving the 70s
- Walks with my dogs that always turn into existential podcasts (with myself)
- A filthy, dark roast coffee that could double as jet fuel
- Screaming lyrics at concerts and pretending it’s therapy (it was never a phase, mom!)
- A good tree sesh followed by late-night rabbit holes about everything and nothing
- Horror marathons all year long — “spooky season” is a lifestyle, not a month

And I've been to a lot of events and the times of kpop have changed especially fan interactions so naturally I've felt a bit disconnected and just do my own thing and enjoy the music.

I went to the XLOV cb showcase last night which was my first ever xlov event and.. 

I've literally never felt such a loving group of fans surround a group before.

Before I even got in the building there was a truck with free drinks/coffee and stickers, cookies literally everything. I was like wow okay that's awesome. And then when I got downstairs everyone was talking and laughing and so many people came up to me giving me freebies and compliments and just saying hi it was so..warm? Like I felt so much love coming from people for them but also respect for the other fans? Like huh? That's so amazing. Anyways I'm happy to be here hahaha

1opkv50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1opkv50/girl_from_halloween/,Girl from Halloween,"After Halloweekend, I need some help to coddle a little situationship. I’m a little rusty with the dating game since my gf of almost 3 years and I broke up like 5 months ago. I’m over it and the girl is over her ex too. Figured I’d mention that context. (This is a repost, but I’d still love help.) It’s a little long, i’m sorry, but there’s a lot of details and I’m kinda overwhelmed. If you have further questions don’t hesitate to dig deeper lol

Anyways, I visited my twin brother at his college over Halloween weekend and was invited to a sorority social. He’s dating a girl in this sorority, and at their social I met one of her friends, let’s call her K. My brother mentioned that K was looking for a Halloween fling, and I was like “oh okay cool”. I’ve never “hooked up” or done anything like that. Only been with people i’ve dated.

At the social, K and I hit it off right away. She got me a shot, I got her a drink, and she kept introducing me to her friends, even people my brother didn’t know. There was definitely a spark, at least in my opinion. She was talking to me a lot and asking questions. At the time I just thought it was the alcohol, and no real interest.

The next night, we all went out again. On the dance floor she started getting close, dancing on me, leaning back against me, all that. She was like “grinding” on me bro. I was suprised but into as a 19 year old single guy is at a bar wearing a monk costume in Halloween. But, when we went back to get a drink, SHE asked for MY Snapchat. (Which I was going to ask at this moment too, which was funny to me.) And I gave it to her, then she invited me to her sorority formal. Of course I said yes enthusiastically.

Afterward, we went back to my brother’s apartment to hang out. I sat next to her on the couch, thigh to thigh, and when I put my arm around her she leaned in a little, but it felt a little awkward to me, so I leaned toward to grab my water and then sat normally again. Later, we both crashed in the living room (separate spots, but we stayed up talking for like half an hour before falling asleep).

The next morning, we woke up about the same time, and we talked for a while again. Sober, of course. I made breakfast for everyone, including her, and she was super appreciative. After that, my brother and I dropped K and my brothers gf off at their house. Later, my brother told me that K’s roommate said she’s actually more interested in me than just a quick Halloween thing.

That night (Saturday) we went out again, this time we were with my brother, his gf, one of our friends, and were supposed to meet a lot of the other sorority girls in the bar. But, only K and I got in. My brother said to stay and have fun and he’d pick me up later. But, the same chemistry was there, we danced, talked, laughed, and I made sure she got home safe when she started feeling a little sick later in (my brother picked us up).

When we dropped her off, I asked her to let me know if she feels better and that I had fun. And she did text me like an hour later that she was sorry she got sick and that she was feeling better. So, we went back to the apartment, slept. Then I woke up to a text from her saying “Hey. Question?”, i just said “Yes?”, and she said “Do you actually want to go to the semi formal still?” So again, I said that i’d go and I was excited for it.

On Monday, K and my brothers gf were supposed to meet up with one of their friends who lived at the same apartment complex as my brother. And last second they decided to all come to the apartment and hang out with us. We smoked a little and then K said we should okay a game. I didn’t sit next to her or anything, I was like across the coffee table. So that sucked, but anyways, she suggested truth or dare, nobody seemed sold, then we played this game called Paranoia. Idk what to think of her trying to suggest games like that. Idk love a second opinion lol

They weren’t there for long though, maybe 2/3 hours tops. I texted her after she left that I had fun and was glad they decided to come by. She apologized for being there for a short time, but they were all tired or smth. I then said that I understood and said that I wished i wasn’t as shy and talked to her more.

Since the weekend, we have been texting sporadically. There would be those moments where it’s back and forth a bit in a short time, then she takes a while to respond. Sometimes hours, like rn i’m on delivered for 4hrs brooo.

Now I’m wondering what to do. Ofc I’ll keep texting and everything. I asked for her instagram and i followed her and she followed me almost immediately. But I want to escalate and make my intrest pretty clear (unless i’ve already done that). I want to keep her interested and not be boring. I’d love to hear your thoughts and how you think this could play out. I want a relationship, and from what I know she might want one too. Finally, what moves should I make at the formal? (next thursday)?

I recently purchased Hifiman Edition XS and saw that I should use the qudelix with it. After using it I am wondering if I should instead just wire the Hifiman to my iphone using a dongle and return the qudelix?

  
What is the point of the qudelix other than bluetooth? The Hifiman Edition XS auto eq preset by Oratory1990 kinda sucks in my opinion and makes it more quiet.

  
Additionally, the qudelix never really gets that loud? Even on the loudest settings its not even able to drown out my mechanical keyboard. Am I doing something wrong? In the volume section the left bar is AAC 44.1 KHz 248 kbps (0.00 dB) and the right bar is Performance 2 VRMS UNBAL (3.5mm) 6dB.

  
Am I missing anything important that needs to change? Love the sound quality but as I am typing this I can hear my keyboard and cant imagine they will work well in a busy coffee shop.

I picked up really well handled 12+ Ro’s a day. Pushed through manufacture training and was top on upselling maintenance packages and #1 in Sunbit out of 4 advisors. I wrote 160 Ro’s a month and hit $57,000 in profit.   The kicker is that my CSI was 883 last month and I had the most surveys with 25 and 6 were low.  I got wrote up for and then today I had only 2 surveys 1 @911 and 1 @460 and the service manager gave me a warning. 10 mins later after I pointed out that the customer email on survey is not the same email on manufacture file. The SM asked me to meet with him with the GM. They wanted me to move back to sales. I started texting a SM at another dealership during this meeting and got a job interview.  I was tired of arguing that my SM just didn’t want me working there. He lets one advisor call in, not show up or call in, another advisor he favors and buys her food and coffee that are her favorite, lets her leave when she needs to, yell at customers. She also got a low score in CSI today.  The one Advisor that calls in a lot also did not make CSI last month and was 20 points lower than me.  The advisor that he favors, he put his wife’s email in the customer record and she filled the survey out and gave her 1000 so no wonder out of 5 surveys she had a 965 last month. In the middle of the meeting I got up and said “see y’all later, I have another job interview down the street”. Went packed my stuff and left!  I got the new job in writing Express Lube so it’s a start!  The whole store has not made CSI in sales or service for months I worked for this company for 3 years and 6 months and they keep eliminating my positions so I am just happy to move on!!

1opksjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1opksjk/something_is_pretending_to_be_me/,Something is pretending to be me,"Hey everyone, I need some help. I’m currently at a loss of what to do here. Something happened to me and my girlfriend last night and it’s just gotten more complicated since.

I should start with a few quick details. My girlfriend and I live together in a small house. Without going into specifics about our location, I’ll just say we live in a decently populated college town that’s not too far down the road from a major city. We’re not living in some desolate cabin in the woods or an old Victorian mansion - so that’s why this has especially caught us by surprise.

Last night, I came home from work. Nothing unordinary about that. I got inside and was taking off my coat when I sort of noticed the house was really quiet. My girlfriend - who I’ll call June after her birth month - usually has music or youtube going. It was just silent in there. So I walk back into our bedroom and that’s when I find June. She’s jammed herself into the far corner of the room and has tears in her eyes.

“Hey, what’s going on? What’s wrong?” I asked her.

“Don’t come any closer!” she hissed back at me.

I was extremely confused to say the least. I instinctively walk closer to try and comfort her. That’s when June reaches for a trophy on the shelf next to her and points it at me.

“I will cave your skull in! Not another step!”

“Baby, what’s going on? It’s just me!” I pleaded with her.

“No it’s not! You’re not him!”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

My mouth was hanging wide open. I couldn’t believe what was going on. All of this after a nine hour shift was a lot to take in. 

I didn’t understand much of anything at that moment, but I was beginning to gather June wasn’t entirely convinced I was me for some reason. She was clearly petrified of something and the hand she held the trophy in was shaking violently. I didn’t want her to bludgeon me with my own trophy. That’s when I thought to maybe say something that could prove I was me.

“Are you really gonna kill me with *my* tenth grade swimming team participant trophy?” I asked with obnoxious emphasis on each overly specific syllable, hoping that would prove something to her.

I saw June slowly glance at the trophy and read the engraved text facing her which couldn’t be seen from where I stood.

“It’s me, honey. I promise. Why don’t you just set that down and we can talk this over, okay?”

June stared at me for a little while longer before slowly disarming herself. With both arms limp by her side, she just started to sob uncontrollably.

“We have to leave first. Then I’ll try to tell you,” June said through sniffles.

We got out of there quickly, hopping in my car and driving back out into the night. The whole time, I was trying to get answers out of her. She would just sob in response.

I parked in a movie theater lot across town. It was raining out and the theater’s neon lights soaked the surrounding area in a comforting red and gold haze. June’s sobbing had eased up a little and I breathed a deep sigh.

“You’ve got to tell me what’s going on. Like, what happened? Cause right now, my mind’s jumping to the worst places. Like, do we need to call the police? Is the house safe? Did someone break in?” I asked with a firm tone. I needed to understand what was happening. “And why did you point a trophy at me and threaten to cave my skull in?”

“I didn’t know if you were you,” June whispered.

“What the fuck does that mean though?”

“You’re not going to believe me.”

“I seriously doubt that.”

June looked at me with crazed eyes and mascara streaming down her face. “You’re *not* going to believe me.”

“Please just tell me. You have to tell me.”

June tugged at her hair, moaning. Tears were still running effortlessly from her eyes like there was a leak somewhere inside. She looked away from me and out the window.

“I was sitting in bed, just waiting for you to come home. I was just watching some youtube or something. I saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I looked and saw something kinda like smoothly coming closer to the bedroom,” June said slowly as if each word could’ve resummoned something.

I wanted to ask her what “smoothly” meant but I didn’t want her to get lost in something so trivial.

“It’s still just a shadow at this point, but it’s definitely real. I see the shadow move closer and closer until it jumps from the floor to the wall and is still coming closer. I didn’t hear any sound at all. I paused my video and called out, asking if you were home. I didn’t hear the front door open though so I knew you couldn’t have been.”

June tried to hide inside herself. It took her a moment to return to what she was saying.

“The shadow kept creeping closer, still no sound. Then, I saw like an actual thing start peeking into the bedroom. I couldn’t make it out. I kept calling out to you, but I knew it wasn’t you. Then it just - it just floated into the bedroom. The entire thing. It floated in there. It looked like you. It had your coat on, your work uniform too. Your pants were even rolled up and I could see the socks you wore today were on it too. White socks with - with red stripes,” June spoke like there were glass shards in her throat.

I couldn’t believe what she was saying. Maybe it was, I don’t know. Maybe it was something wrong with the house, a leak of some kind that made her hallucinate. I don’t know.

June continued, “the face was mangled but I could tell it was supposed to be your face. Your general look but everything was all wrong. Your mouth - its mouth - drooped so low it might’ve been hanging off of its face, but it was smiling, or looked like it was trying to smile at me. The eyes were awful, like overly white cartoonish looking circles with a black hole in the middle. No red veins and no iris. Nothing was detailed. Not the clothes, not the shoes, none of it. Everything was just lacking texture, you know?”

I did not *know.* What she was describing was something impossible. A breakthrough or some kind of proof of the supernatural or something else, but whatever it was is something that would never happen to us. We were nobodies living in a nowhere town. It was impossible. I couldn’t contain my judgemental stare as she spoke. I contemplated her sanity and our future together. I’d have to have her committed somewhere, or we’d just have to break up or something extreme. Because this was extreme and I couldn’t help her if this was a product of her mind warping to some disorder I doubt we could work through.

June continued still, “it just looked at me for a few seconds. It felt like years. I got out of bed and pressed myself against the wall. It was - it was all wrong. One arm was longer than the other, its fingers were stuck out of a circular flesh ball at gross angles. The legs were not being used properly or at all, one of them looked like it had a knot in it. It was just - it was the worst thing I’ve ever seen. After a few seconds, it slowly turned away from me and hovered out of the room. It never made a sound. Like ten seconds later, I heard the front door open and you came in.”

There was a long silence in the car. I couldn’t talk and she had nothing more to say. She returned to crying while my mind tried to contort all of what she had said into a weapon that I could then use against her. It’s all I could think of to preserve reality. I was being a selfish jackass.

“I’m sorry that this happened to you. How have you been doing recently?” I asked, breaking the long silence. To me, what I said was as polite as I could piece together. I had successfully filtered all of the harsher and more abrasive things that were swirling around in my head and spoke something gentle and caring instead. To June, my question to her contained a break in trust. Something jagged hidden behind my kind words that let her know there was a question of her account and of her character.

“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”

“You know - mentally. Have you been struggling with anything?” I doubled down, because believing her meant there was a cheap copy of me gliding around our house at that moment.

It was an awful couple of hours in that cold car. We yelled at each other and said things that would be hard to take back. There was a divide formed between us. June was convinced she saw something pretending to be me and I had confirmed in my mind she was delusional for it. No longer the June I knew and loved. Yells and pauses and tears and hostility. At the end of it all, the only thing floating around between us was where to go from there. Where do we sleep tonight? We didn’t want to be together, but being alone felt worse somehow. At that moment, every fiber of me thought my girlfriend was crazy - but something in me did *not* want to go back to our house.

The movie theater’s neon lights had long been shut off, and we shivered in the dark together. The silence was a droning chorus of ugly thoughts. I finally turned on the car.

“You can just take me to a motel or something,” June broke the silence.

“Don’t be ridiculous.”

“I will *not* go back there.”

“Relax. We’re not gonna go back. Not tonight.”

I drove us through the silent streets until my eyelids felt like stone. We rested near the town’s college, in some sleepy district where the buildings looked like models. We slept in the car, and something in me was perfectly happy about that.

We were awoken early in the morning by a garbage truck slamming a dumpster down right next to my car. It was still dark.

Me and June sort of looked at each other and our eyes said enough.

“I’m sorry,” I said to her.

“I’m not crazy.”

“Okay. I believe you.”

I felt horrible about all the things I said in our argument. I still didn’t want to fully bend, though. There couldn’t be a crude version of me in our house. That’s just not something that happens. We had to go back home. Our whole life was there. Our cat, our belongings, my keycard for work which was in three hours. I was going in there because I had to prove the other me wasn’t real. Then, we could work on rebuilding. Whatever was wrong with June, we’d work through. We’d overcome it. The morning made me inspired to fix everything - even the things well beyond my control.

When I turned into our neighborhood, June wouldn’t have it. She thrashed around in the car and screamed at me.

“Turn around! Please!”

“Calm down! I’m just going to run in real quick!”

“No. Do not go in there. I won’t let you.”

“It’s gonna be just fine, you’ll see.”

“No! You can’t go back in there.”

We didn’t reach any compromise before the car was idle in front of our house. The house, now soaking in morning sunlight, felt more approachable and safe. June was not as easily disarmed.

“If you go in that house, you’re going to die. I just know it,” June said in a disturbingly calm way.

“I’m going to be okay. There’s nothing to worry about,” I said with deflating confidence. “I-I don’t have any interest in dying, okay? I just need my keycard for work and I’ll feed Larry while I’m at it.”

“If Larry is still there, please just bring him out here. Can you at least do that?”

“Sure. I’ll bring him out here - even if he scratches me to death in the process.”

I smiled softly at June and got out of the car.

I looked up at our house as I climbed our gravel driveway. I was only a few steps from the door when I realized every light in the house had been turned on. The TVs were blaring too, the volume must’ve been cranked to a hundred on the two we had.

Despite the oddness of that, I still didn’t think an entity was inside. More likely, I thought an intruder could be in there. I walked the entire perimeter of our small house a few times, looking in every window which pieced together a near-entire view of the place. I was confident I would’ve seen a person in there unless they were hiding in a closet.

I looped around to the front door and peered in one more time. I saw Larry looking at me on the coffee table. I spotted my keycard right next to him, too. I opened the door and stepped in.

The first thing I noticed was the noise of the TVs. They were unbearably loud, a shrieking infomercial and a distorted political talk show host clashing together into a horrible nausea. I turned the TV in the living room off and gave Larry a few pets before picking him up. I grabbed my key card and was ready to run out. That’s when I smelled something unusual.

It was a strange sort of metallic smell that was heavy in the air. Then Larry freaked out and sliced me open in three different places with his claws. He ran off into another room, keeping low. I inspected the damage he dealt me and went to go catch him.

I figured Larry was hiding in the bedroom and I walked in there. It reeked of the bloody scent in there. I looked under the bed and saw Larry wrapped into a tight ball far out of reach. I tried to call him but he wouldn’t budge. I got on the ground and crawled under the bed where I was able to get an arm around him. He started hissing at me which he never did. I grabbed him regardless. I was starting to regret coming inside.

I wrestled with Larry and eventually got him out from under the bed. That’s when I felt something in the room with me.

Larry scratched me again and even deeper, escaping out of the room and leaving me in there with it.

In the bedroom, floating silently above the bed, was something impossible. I still can’t comprehend it. I still barely believe in myself.

It was some awful imposter. It was pretending to be June. It was specifically June from last night when I came home from work. It looked like a horrific interpretation of her terrified face, its flesh mimicked her clothing crudely, altering its torso with some skin pigmentation to resemble her graphic tee but it did a terrible job of it. It had made little progress in the way of limbs, but the furthest along was a miserable excuse for an arm which held something boxy and golden. I think it was a fleshy parody of my swim team trophy that she threatened me with the night before.

It was the most sinister and disgusting and impossible thing I’ve ever seen. I felt all the color drain from me and I wasted no time getting out of there. It either let me leave or it hadn’t figured a way to trap me yet. It certainly was not convincing me by producing June’s likeness.

I ran down to the car, screaming like a maniac. I couldn’t find Larry again and I left my keycard behind, so my visit was all for nothing. 

June had to spend a few hours calming me down and tending to Larry’s deep slashes he left in my arms and neck. I was reduced to an infant for a while. I was pretty much just shocked at what I had seen, but June made me feel better about it over time. 

I still feel awful, so awful that I doubted her so passionately and that I thought such negative things about her when she was right all along. Now knowing what she had seen, it’s a miracle she didn’t up and leave me when I expressed doubt. I guess it’s impossible to imagine when you’ve never seen such a thing before.

We’ve been parked outside the movie theater all day, I have three missed calls and five long, unread texts from my boss. My arms are throbbing and both of our mental states are deteriorating. We don’t know what to do. We can’t go back there. We will not go back there. If you have any sort of advice or guidance you can offer us, anything would help right now. I know I probably sound like an insane person, but truthfully I’m just scared out of my mind. I’m scared that thing will find us and, if I see it again, it’ll be a more convincing rendition of June.",1,1762390136.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old nerd from New England who lives for conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site—and it actually got featured on the news.

Cosplay has given me a great community, whether I’m rocking Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and I have an odd talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes (seriously, it happens way too often).

Now for the real talk: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want to, but because of shyness, timing, and life just not lining up. I’ve grown a lot, though, and I’m ready for something genuine. If you’re kind, nerdy (or at least nerd-friendly), and believe in connection over perfection, I think we could click.

Cosplay isn’t required—what matters is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where things go. If you’re nearby, I’d love to start with something simple, like grabbing a coffee.

1opkrbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1opkrbw/something_is_pretending_to_be_me/,Something is pretending to be me,"Hey everyone, I need some help. I’m currently at a loss of what to do here. Something happened to me and my girlfriend last night and it’s just gotten more complicated since.

I should start with a few quick details. My girlfriend and I live together in a small house. Without going into specifics about our location, I’ll just say we live in a decently populated college town that’s not too far down the road from a major city. We’re not living in some desolate cabin in the woods or an old Victorian mansion - so that’s why this has especially caught us by surprise.

Last night, I came home from work. Nothing unordinary about that. I got inside and was taking off my coat when I sort of noticed the house was really quiet. My girlfriend - who I’ll call June after her birth month - usually has music or youtube going. It was just silent in there. So I walk back into our bedroom and that’s when I find June. She’s jammed herself into the far corner of the room and has tears in her eyes.

“Hey, what’s going on? What’s wrong?” I asked her.

“Don’t come any closer!” she hissed back at me.

I was extremely confused to say the least. I instinctively walk closer to try and comfort her. That’s when June reaches for a trophy on the shelf next to her and points it at me.

“I will cave your skull in! Not another step!”

“Baby, what’s going on? It’s just me!” I pleaded with her.

“No it’s not! You’re not him!”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

My mouth was hanging wide open. I couldn’t believe what was going on. All of this after a nine hour shift was a lot to take in. 

I didn’t understand much of anything at that moment, but I was beginning to gather June wasn’t entirely convinced I was me for some reason. She was clearly petrified of something and the hand she held the trophy in was shaking violently. I didn’t want her to bludgeon me with my own trophy. That’s when I thought to maybe say something that could prove I was me.

“Are you really gonna kill me with *my* tenth grade swimming team participant trophy?” I asked with obnoxious emphasis on each overly specific syllable, hoping that would prove something to her.

I saw June slowly glance at the trophy and read the engraved text facing her which couldn’t be seen from where I stood.

“It’s me, honey. I promise. Why don’t you just set that down and we can talk this over, okay?”

June stared at me for a little while longer before slowly disarming herself. With both arms limp by her side, she just started to sob uncontrollably.

“We have to leave first. Then I’ll try to tell you,” June said through sniffles.

We got out of there quickly, hopping in my car and driving back out into the night. The whole time, I was trying to get answers out of her. She would just sob in response.

I parked in a movie theater lot across town. It was raining out and the theater’s neon lights soaked the surrounding area in a comforting red and gold haze. June’s sobbing had eased up a little and I breathed a deep sigh.

“You’ve got to tell me what’s going on. Like, what happened? Cause right now, my mind’s jumping to the worst places. Like, do we need to call the police? Is the house safe? Did someone break in?” I asked with a firm tone. I needed to understand what was happening. “And why did you point a trophy at me and threaten to cave my skull in?”

“I didn’t know if you were you,” June whispered.

“What the fuck does that mean though?”

“You’re not going to believe me.”

“I seriously doubt that.”

June looked at me with crazed eyes and mascara streaming down her face. “You’re *not* going to believe me.”

“Please just tell me. You have to tell me.”

June tugged at her hair, moaning. Tears were still running effortlessly from her eyes like there was a leak somewhere inside. She looked away from me and out the window.

“I was sitting in bed, just waiting for you to come home. I was just watching some youtube or something. I saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I looked and saw something kinda like smoothly coming closer to the bedroom,” June said slowly as if each word could’ve resummoned something.

I wanted to ask her what “smoothly” meant but I didn’t want her to get lost in something so trivial.

“It’s still just a shadow at this point, but it’s definitely real. I see the shadow move closer and closer until it jumps from the floor to the wall and is still coming closer. I didn’t hear any sound at all. I paused my video and called out, asking if you were home. I didn’t hear the front door open though so I knew you couldn’t have been.”

June tried to hide inside herself. It took her a moment to return to what she was saying.

“The shadow kept creeping closer, still no sound. Then, I saw like an actual thing start peeking into the bedroom. I couldn’t make it out. I kept calling out to you, but I knew it wasn’t you. Then it just - it just floated into the bedroom. The entire thing. It floated in there. It looked like you. It had your coat on, your work uniform too. Your pants were even rolled up and I could see the socks you wore today were on it too. White socks with - with red stripes,” June spoke like there were glass shards in her throat.

I couldn’t believe what she was saying. Maybe it was, I don’t know. Maybe it was something wrong with the house, a leak of some kind that made her hallucinate. I don’t know.

June continued, “the face was mangled but I could tell it was supposed to be your face. Your general look but everything was all wrong. Your mouth - its mouth - drooped so low it might’ve been hanging off of its face, but it was smiling, or looked like it was trying to smile at me. The eyes were awful, like overly white cartoonish looking circles with a black hole in the middle. No red veins and no iris. Nothing was detailed. Not the clothes, not the shoes, none of it. Everything was just lacking texture, you know?”

I did not *know.* What she was describing was something impossible. A breakthrough or some kind of proof of the supernatural or something else, but whatever it was is something that would never happen to us. We were nobodies living in a nowhere town. It was impossible. I couldn’t contain my judgemental stare as she spoke. I contemplated her sanity and our future together. I’d have to have her committed somewhere, or we’d just have to break up or something extreme. Because this was extreme and I couldn’t help her if this was a product of her mind warping to some disorder I doubt we could work through.

June continued still, “it just looked at me for a few seconds. It felt like years. I got out of bed and pressed myself against the wall. It was - it was all wrong. One arm was longer than the other, its fingers were stuck out of a circular flesh ball at gross angles. The legs were not being used properly or at all, one of them looked like it had a knot in it. It was just - it was the worst thing I’ve ever seen. After a few seconds, it slowly turned away from me and hovered out of the room. It never made a sound. Like ten seconds later, I heard the front door open and you came in.”

There was a long silence in the car. I couldn’t talk and she had nothing more to say. She returned to crying while my mind tried to contort all of what she had said into a weapon that I could then use against her. It’s all I could think of to preserve reality. I was being a selfish jackass.

“I’m sorry that this happened to you. How have you been doing recently?” I asked, breaking the long silence. To me, what I said was as polite as I could piece together. I had successfully filtered all of the harsher and more abrasive things that were swirling around in my head and spoke something gentle and caring instead. To June, my question to her contained a break in trust. Something jagged hidden behind my kind words that let her know there was a question of her account and of her character.

“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”

“You know - mentally. Have you been struggling with anything?” I doubled down, because believing her meant there was a cheap copy of me gliding around our house at that moment.

It was an awful couple of hours in that cold car. We yelled at each other and said things that would be hard to take back. There was a divide formed between us. June was convinced she saw something pretending to be me and I had confirmed in my mind she was delusional for it. No longer the June I knew and loved. Yells and pauses and tears and hostility. At the end of it all, the only thing floating around between us was where to go from there. Where do we sleep tonight? We didn’t want to be together, but being alone felt worse somehow. At that moment, every fiber of me thought my girlfriend was crazy - but something in me did *not* want to go back to our house.

The movie theater’s neon lights had long been shut off, and we shivered in the dark together. The silence was a droning chorus of ugly thoughts. I finally turned on the car.

“You can just take me to a motel or something,” June broke the silence.

“Don’t be ridiculous.”

“I will *not* go back there.”

“Relax. We’re not gonna go back. Not tonight.”

I drove us through the silent streets until my eyelids felt like stone. We rested near the town’s college, in some sleepy district where the buildings looked like models. We slept in the car, and something in me was perfectly happy about that.

We were awoken early in the morning by a garbage truck slamming a dumpster down right next to my car. It was still dark.

Me and June sort of looked at each other and our eyes said enough.

“I’m sorry,” I said to her.

“I’m not crazy.”

“Okay. I believe you.”

I felt horrible about all the things I said in our argument. I still didn’t want to fully bend, though. There couldn’t be a crude version of me in our house. That’s just not something that happens. We had to go back home. Our whole life was there. Our cat, our belongings, my keycard for work which was in three hours. I was going in there because I had to prove the other me wasn’t real. Then, we could work on rebuilding. Whatever was wrong with June, we’d work through. We’d overcome it. The morning made me inspired to fix everything - even the things well beyond my control.

When I turned into our neighborhood, June wouldn’t have it. She thrashed around in the car and screamed at me.

“Turn around! Please!”

“Calm down! I’m just going to run in real quick!”

“No. Do not go in there. I won’t let you.”

“It’s gonna be just fine, you’ll see.”

“No! You can’t go back in there.”

We didn’t reach any compromise before the car was idle in front of our house. The house, now soaking in morning sunlight, felt more approachable and safe. June was not as easily disarmed.

“If you go in that house, you’re going to die. I just know it,” June said in a disturbingly calm way.

“I’m going to be okay. There’s nothing to worry about,” I said with deflating confidence. “I-I don’t have any interest in dying, okay? I just need my keycard for work and I’ll feed Larry while I’m at it.”

“If Larry is still there, please just bring him out here. Can you at least do that?”

“Sure. I’ll bring him out here - even if he scratches me to death in the process.”

I smiled softly at June and got out of the car.

I looked up at our house as I climbed our gravel driveway. I was only a few steps from the door when I realized every light in the house had been turned on. The TVs were blaring too, the volume must’ve been cranked to a hundred on the two we had.

1opkr5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1opkr5l/i_need_help_to_understand_a_situation_with_a_girl/,I need help to understand a situation with a girl from Halloween.,"After Halloweekend, I need some help to coddle a little situationship. I’m a little rusty with the dating game since my gf of almost 3 years and I broke up like 5 months ago. I’m over it and the girl is over her ex too. Figured I’d mention that context. (This is a repost, but I’d still love help.) *It’s a little long, i’m sorry, but there’s a lot of details and I’m kinda overwhelmed. If you have further questions don’t hesitate to dig deeper lol*

Anyways, I visited my twin brother at his college over Halloween weekend and was invited to a sorority social. He’s dating a girl in this sorority, and at their social I met one of her friends, let’s call her K. My brother mentioned that K was looking for a Halloween fling, and I was like “oh okay cool”. I’ve never “hooked up” or done anything like that. Only been with people i’ve dated. 

At the social, K and I hit it off right away. She got me a shot, I got her a drink, and she kept introducing me to her friends, even people my brother didn’t know. There was definitely a spark, at least in my opinion. She was talking to me a lot and asking questions. At the time I just thought it was the alcohol, and no real interest. 

The next night, we all went out again. On the dance floor she started getting close, dancing on me, leaning back against me, all that. She was like “grinding” on me bro. I was suprised but into as a 19 year old single guy is at a bar wearing a monk costume in Halloween. But, when we went back to get a drink, SHE asked for MY Snapchat. (Which I was going to ask at this moment too, which was funny to me.) And I gave it to her, then she invited me to her sorority formal. Of course I said yes enthusiastically. 

Afterward, we went back to my brother’s apartment to hang out. I sat next to her on the couch, thigh to thigh, and when I put my arm around her she leaned in a little, but it felt a little awkward to me, so I leaned toward to grab my water and then sat normally again. Later, we both crashed in the living room (separate spots, but we stayed up talking for like half an hour before falling asleep).

The next morning, we woke up about the same time, and we talked for a while again. Sober, of course. I made breakfast for everyone, including her, and she was super appreciative. After that, my brother and I dropped K and my brothers gf off at their house. Later, my brother told me that K’s roommate said she’s actually more interested in me than just a quick Halloween thing.

That night (Saturday) we went out again, this time we were with my brother, his gf, one of our friends, and were supposed to meet a lot of the other sorority girls in the bar. But, only K and I got in. My brother said to stay and have fun and he’d pick me up later. But, the same chemistry was there, we danced, talked, laughed, and I made sure she got home safe when she started feeling a little sick later in (my brother picked us up).

When we dropped her off, I asked her to let me know if she feels better and that I had fun. And she did text me like an hour later that she was sorry she got sick and that she was feeling better. So, we went back to the apartment, slept. Then I woke up to a text from her saying “Hey. Question?”, i just said “Yes?”, and she said “Do you actually want to go to the semi formal still?” So again, I said that i’d go and I was excited for it. 

On Monday, K and my brothers gf were supposed to meet up with one of their friends who lived at the same apartment complex as my brother. And last second they decided to all come to the apartment and hang out with us. We smoked a little and then K said we should okay a game. I didn’t sit next to her or anything, I was like across the coffee table. So that sucked, but anyways, she suggested truth or dare, nobody seemed sold, then we played this game called Paranoia. Idk what to think of her trying to suggest games like that. Idk love a second opinion lol

They weren’t there for long though, maybe 2/3 hours tops. I texted her after she left that I had fun and was glad they decided to come by. She apologized for being there for a short time, but they were all tired or smth. I then said that I understood and said that I wished i wasn’t as shy and talked to her more. 

Since the weekend, we have been texting sporadically. There would be those moments where it’s back and forth a bit in a short time, then she takes a while to respond. Sometimes hours, like rn i’m on delivered for 4hrs brooo. 

Now I’m wondering what to do. Ofc I’ll keep texting and everything. I asked for her instagram and i followed her and she followed me almost immediately. But I want to escalate and make my intrest pretty clear (unless i’ve already done that). I want to keep her interested and not be boring. I’d love to hear your thoughts and how you think this could play out. I want a relationship, and from what I know she might want one too. Finally, what moves should I make at the formal? (next thursday)? 

I have more details and stories but I feel bad typing so much already, if you want to hear them lmk. ",1,1762390034.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

But this time, she grabbed the cup and put her fingers inside it while she wrote. Like, thumb outside, fingers inside. And she had long nails, so her fingers/nails were kind of… all up in the cup.

I have germ issues. I fully know that’s my own thing. So I didn’t say anything. Because I figured it's probably my own issue, plus I don’t like being the customer who corrects. Baristas already deal with enough bullshit.

1opkpzi,https://i.redd.it/7umjrd45ajzf1.jpeg,Roborock QV 35A Review,"Upgraded from a older Roomba to the QV 35A and for what it is, it rocks. Keep in mind this is a budget friendly middle of the road model. 

I have two dogs and two cats, vinyl flooring and area rugs/bathroom mats in 870 sq feet. 

Before setup I arranged my living spaces to accommodate the QV35A e.g left enough space between nightstands, checked for fallen items, tied up cords with zip ties etc 

Setup 
— Super simple 
— App is a bit complicated/un intuitive until you familiarize yourself with the interface
— Mapped the space accurately and quickly 

General Settings
— Suction Power: turbo
— Cleaning Count: x2
— Mopping: Moderate water
— Cleaning Count: 1x
— Auto Empty: high 
— Mop Clean Frequency: 20 min

Vacuuming
— Overall great suction and picked up 98% of all dirt and dog hair 
— Surprisingly cleaned straight edges very well
— 90 degree and unusual angled spaces is where it struggled and left some pet hair 
— Low pile bathroom rugs were vacuumed well
— It’s fairly quiet 
— It handled the pets following it and poking it very well. 
— Can confirm as long as the cat doesn’t sit on the dome, it keeps cleaning without issue. 

Mopping
— Edge cleaning: 4-5cm non-mopped area along any edge 
— Handled minor mud from dogs well
— Handled moderate spills of juice well
— Handled dry juice spills well
— It’s fairly quiet 
— No streaking 

Obstacle Avoidance
— It only struggled with low profile metal frames on the table and night stands. I simply designed a small no-go zone at the coffee table and night stand. 

Cons
— It’s slow compared to some other models. It took 67 minutes to vacuum and mop the space. It does vacuum the space twice adding on 15 minutes to the total runtime.
— No hot air drying — not a big concern of mine. I wash my floors every 2-3 days.
— No hot water washing
— It’s taller than some higher end models making it a tight fit
— Edge mopping gap of 4-5cm 
— It is afraid of larger tufts of dog hair. It behaves as if large tufts of dog hair are objects and circles around (see photo for reference). I didn’t expect it to handle large tufts well. 

Maintenance 
— The single roller will bind up with pet hair after a week or so. It takes 2 minutes once a week to untangle it. 

Overall opinion
— I don’t believe any product will reduce vacuuming and mopping 100%. For a middle of the road, budget friendly combo unit, it does everything I expected it to and managed to deal with the pet hair. I would strongly suggest as others have, to vacuum your space twice before mopping if you have pets. This will prevent the unit from plugging.",1,1762389945.0,RobotVacuums,0,1.0,False
1opkpur,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1opkpur/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting?,"I went to a coffee shop I’ve been going to for years and there was a new barista on shift. I ordered a hot latte. Normally when the cup gets picked up to be labeled, the barista just holds it from the outside and writes the order on it.

But this time, she grabbed the cup and put her fingers inside it while she wrote. Like, thumb outside, fingers inside. And she had long nails, so her fingers/nails were kind of… all up in the cup.

I have germ issues. I fully know that’s my own thing. So I didn’t say anything. Because I figured it's probably my own issue, plus I don’t like being the customer who corrects. Baristas already deal with enough bullshit.

So I just smiled, paid, and left. But now I'm wondering. Do people do that? Am I weird for being grossed out by it?",2,1762389935.0,barista,5,1.0,False

It would roll off my back except we have daughters.,"We have three daughters (ages 5, 2, and 3 months). And one lovely little boy (just turned 4). I don't want them growing up hearing these things at the breakfast table every day.

Today my husband was talking about Chaucer. There's a character in The Canterbury Tales who is apparently a proud gold digger. My husband says ""And it just goes to show, nothing's changed! She's just like women are today! She's..."" blah blah blah. His mate smirked and joined in.

What I wanted to say was ""Your daughters can hear you, y'know."" Or maybe: ""Funny how men without a woman seem to desperately want one of us gold digging shrews to complete them."" Or maybe: ""Interesting. Looks like two men who wish they could have sex.""

But I didn't.

I didn't because my husband has become a bitter, angry, self-centred and cruel person without any self awareness. And pointing out that I dont appreciate hearing nasty things about my gender won't get him to shut up, it'll just earn me a lecture on how I can't take a joke or how I need to be less sensitive.

Instead, I sipped my coffee and said in a flat, dry, tone: ""Sprinkle. Sprinkle.""

I take lithium, lamotrigine and olanzapine. Fantastic for the most part. 6 years of medication and my mood swings are much more subtle and I haven't had a heavy episode this year which is great. The only problem I encountered is that as a uni student , this semester I got lectures at 8am every day (I usually have them around noon). I thought I would get used to it but the semester is coming to an end and I can't stay awake for 2 minutes straight till around 9-10am. Of course I don't pay attention to class at all at this time but fortunately I can get back on track easily at home. If I have a test at 8am I take half of my olanzapine pill the night before and drink a small amount of coffee in the morning. 

Before being diagnosed I would wake up at 5am and be productive all day without problem (I could have been manic but it also could have been that I was just like my mom and she doesn't have any mental illness).

I wonder if someone has the same struggle and how do they cope with it. I said I drink coffee but actually I can't drink it regularly so it's a no. Also I'm not allowed sugar of any type (I can only eat sweets once or twice a month) and can't drink energy drinks even if they're sugarfree. I've found that matcha helps a bit but it's a bit expensive to me (and I just drink cheap culinary grade). Also I drink protein chocomilk every day but it doesn't seem to do much....

Thank you very much for your advice

Matalino at Pogi wala ako masabi pero.. super mapanglait nga lang ever since na nakilala ko to.Lapitin talaga to si guy, As in mga babae sa office ay nagkakadarapa sakanya at sobrang proud sya don. Nagpapadala ng foods, letters, coffee or basta any gift na nagbboost ng kanyang pogi ego.

Ngayon for almost 5 months na magkausap kami walang araw ata na hindi nya inisist na pogi sya. Wala naman probs, kaso wag mo ko utusan beh na sabihin yan araw araw. Kasi nakakaumay din diba? hahaha Very conceited talaga to si kuya mo sa lahat ng anggulo. Sa paguusap namin nalaman ko na niloko sya ng mga past relationship nya at pinagpalit daw sya sa sigbin ganun!

Ilang beses na kami nag date, nung una akala ko lang kasi after work namin kami lumabas kaya sya bad breath kasi diba.. Kaya pagbigyan. Kaya ko pa to! Crush ko to e. Kaso tehhhhh??! Sinasabi ko sayo. Nag staycation kami sa tagaytay! Ito na tangina! Anlala talaga ng bad breath nya :( Gusto nya na mag s*x kami early morning? He actually brush his teeth naman prior that time kaso amoy imburnal padin!! As in tangina yung mint maamoy mo pero di nanalo sa imburnal. Nagtakip nalang si ate nyo ng unan sa mukha. Hayop!(o btw hindi rin sya magaling sa kama as in walang bilang, pero sa kwento nya kala mo kung sinong expert na at apaka galing talaga huhu never again)

So ito na ang twist. Sinabi ko sakanya na ang baho ng hininga nya sobra!

And now.. galit na galit sakin at depressed sya because of me. As in ngayon lahat ng post nya sa socials ay gusto nya na daw mawala.

Kasi pag naaalala ko yung mapanglait nyang actions is, bigla akong natatawa na sinabi ko yun sakanya. NAWALA DAW TALAGA YUNG CONFIDENCE NYA BECAUSE OF ME, BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAID. Nakukunsensya naman ako pero kasi nagsabi lang naman ako ng totoo. Dapat ba kong makunsensya lalo at na depressed sya? Welp.

*NAG SORRY PO AKO AT SINABI KO YUN SA PARAAN NA ALAM KONG DI SYA MA OOFFEND AT MAAYOS NA SALITA.

I'm assuming my cold brew made with a ratio of 1 cup coffee grounds to 8 cups water was really weak? It still tasted great despite that. Doing the math it looks like my batch was 1:20 by weight. I steeped it for 24 hours in the refrigerator.

1opkcr0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opkcr0,THE WOOTING LIVES!,"Hey all, normally I don’t post stuff like this but I couldn’t be more proud of myself. Around an hour ago, 2 mins before I start working, I accidentally spilled coffee all over my Wooting 60HE, I’ve owned this keyboard for about a year now and this is the first time it has ever happened. 

I immediately unplug the keyboard, tried my fastest to remove all of the keycaps, I even broke it on the last few keys which gave me a heart attack because I thought what snapped was the stubs, and tried to clean the board (I’m referring to what we see when all the keycaps are removed) with isopropyl alcohol. I also was panicking since I knew from watching a lot of random soldering videos that liquid damage has to be cleaned at the back of the board, especially where the main electronics and the usb-c plug are (sorry I don’t know what they’re called).

Unscrew I go on all that’s holding the keyboard, and I see that the foam below was clean, no smell of the coffee on it, but shit was dirty as hell, and there were another set of screws holding the plate and the pcb, I have to say, the stock case of the wooting is pretty cool, saying “don’t screw up” and shit which I was laughing while panicking when unscrewing the plate and pcb.

So there I was on the PCB, and the foam in the middle is where the coffee accumulated, and the PCB looks clean with minimal coffee stains on it, but I still tried to clean it up as much as possible, and about after 10 mins of cleanup and drying, I thought everything was all good and plugged it in, boom, there was light.  for about 3-5 seconds and then it suddenly stopped. My heart sank and I thought I fucked up, so I got the usb from my mouse and plugged it just to see if it was a cable issue, but no. 

I was panicking again at this state, but I decided that there mustve been a spot where I missed, and ultimately I just decided to go crazy on the isopropyl and clean everything up. 

After another 20 minutes of making sure shit is clean, I plugged it in and there was light, it didn’t stop, so I was actually happy. I unplugged it again, reassembled it in the case without the screws, and I tried typing without the keycaps, and it was working.

 I don’t know what the fuck happened, but rest assured everything’s working, tested all the keys, functionality everything is fine, RGB’s still good.

Idk what happened, but all I can say is that it mustve died and resurrected. Can’t say how long until it happens again, but I was just so proud I managed to get it working again",3,1762388976.0,WootingKB,0,1.0,False
1opkcpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1opkcpg/plastic_chair_thirty_degrees/,"Plastic Chair, Thirty Degrees","They let me take her out.       
I sit on a cheap plastic chair -      
the kind that groans when you move -      
next to a girl wrapped in a sweater      
though the sun is sweating at thirty degrees.     
        
Her eyes are milked of light,      
as if someone shelled them      
to stop the night from walking in.      
They gave her this - soft sedation -      
to keep the spirits behind her eyes,       
to keep the horrors from stepping forward.      
       
My daughter leans like a hinge,       
small against the world.      
She smiles at me the way houses smile when rain begins -      
not quite open, only remembering how.       
       
Across the yard a man with tattoos like violent prayers        
cradles a glittery stress ball,       
pressing sequins into his palms        
as if the sparkles could stitch his skin.       
        
We talk about small things -        
a bus that smells like boiled coffee,      
the name of a dog she once met -      
words like paper boats on a puddle of ordinary.      
       
She tells me they wanted to send her home.      
Home - my mouth shapes the word      
and finds nothing to put there.       
She had no home, only streets      
that learned her footprints.        
So they closed the door and brought her inside -        
medicated the edges off her thinking,      
softened what might eat itself,       
turned sharp into soft clay.      
      
When she tried to take herself       
it was not triumph nor theater -       
it was a geography of nowhere,       
a map folded and lost.       
The hospital folded her into a room,      
then into a pill,      
then into a lullaby of doses.       
They promise safety and hand you silence.      
       
Her hand finds mine - small, tired -      
and I count the bones of it      
like a rosary I didn’t know I owned,      
while the air smells of bleach and pretend.     
      
She laughs - thin - at something I say     
about a window that never opens.      
It sounds like a match’s last breath.       
I want to gather her into me,       
patch the parts that keep wanting to leave,      
but what is a father      
if not two hands and a terrible wish?     
       
The sun lays a strip of heat across her knees.       
For a minute she is warm like bread.      
The tattooed man squeezes his glitter ball     
until the sequins are only memory,      
and I think of all the ways       
people try to hold themselves together.       
       
They gave her medicine to quiet the noise,     
but you can’t dull need      
without dulling the edges of being.       
We sit with dulled eyes and softened tongues,       
and I name the things without names -      
fear, hunger, the distance of sleep.      
       
When they told me why she was kept      
they used the language of safety.       
When I looked at her       
I saw only a child counted out by the city.      
       
I tell her about being small once,      
how the world smelled like new pennies.      
She tells me about sleeping on a bench      
that learned her shape.        
We trade small talismans of sense -      
nonsense that means everything.      
Her hair hums with hospital light.       
Her sweater is too warm.      
       
I stand to leave      
and the chair makes its complaint.      
She grips my sleeve like a promise       
I am afraid to keep.       
On the walk back the sky is a bruise      
uncomprehending its own color.       
I hold her close enough to hear her heart -      
slow, cautious, still learning its own name.      
       
We are not healed.      
We are present.       
We are stubborn as a weed through concrete.        
I fold the day into the shape of a hand      
and carry it home -       
not a home-home, not yet -       
but a stopping place       
with a door that does not point only to leaving.        
        
At night I listen for the small sounds she makes while sleeping -      
the ones that tell me the horrors have been pressed back for now -       
and I tell myself the only prayer I can afford:      
stay, stay, stay.

Two dark figures ran with reckless abandon across the monolithic cathedrals of bone and technology—ivory towers rising into the smog-stained sky. Behind them thundered the Beast, a hulking predator of muscle and sinew, its jaws hanging open in a slavering frenzy as it closed the distance.

Unit-187 risked a glance back. His combat suit, blackened and scarred, bore the silver embroidery of his designation. A few strides behind, Unit-354 struggled to keep pace, her breath sharp and ragged inside the mask. Training had never prepared her for this—for the sound of tearing metal that followed each ground-shaking strike of the creature’s claws.

Half a mile more. Just half a mile, and they’d cross the Line.

Unit-187 felt a flicker of pity for her. He’d seen that look before—the wide, stunned eyes of the newly forged. For the artificial, survival wasn’t instinct. It was revelation.

Without their weapons, running was their only choice. Whatever enhancements they possessed would mean nothing against a threat of this grade. It would easily crush their bodies in a single swipe.

Falling back to match 354’s pace, 187 slipped an arm beneath hers.

“Jump!” he shouted, pulling her closer. His voice was calm, certain—commanding faith where reason failed. Together they leapt from one of the white monoliths that pierced the planet’s surface to the next.

Maybe it wouldn’t follow. He knew better. He’d seen enough to know this was only delaying the inevitable. Yet when her bright green eyes met his, he couldn’t turn away. He couldn’t leave her behind. 

Looking back he saw the creature closing distance with its fleshy pale form. The Beast lunged forward, its front limbs retracting beneath its massive frame before propelling it ahead as sparks and shrapnel flew up from behind its feet.

When he finally decided not to look back, she couldn’t help herself.

The Beast’s gaping maw opened wide behind them, exhaling a wave of hot, sweet breath that made their skin slick with instant sweat.

354 screamed—a sound so sharp it split through 187’s ear, a raw vibration against his skull. Then, in blind terror, she shoved him away as if he were the threat.

The force threw him off balance. He twisted as he fell, the white spires rising and turning beneath him. For a heartbeat, he saw her—354—caught in the Beast’s jaws, her lifeless eyes staring out as its teeth ground down.

Chapter 1


Dr. Weiss’s heels clattered down the hall, her stern face half-hidden behind her glasses. A message from HQ had just arrived — urgent. A Code Black had been issued. All personnel with top-level clearance were to report immediately.

The fluorescent lights droned above, washing the pearl-white walls in a sterile glow. Fine, just fine, she thought. No coffee. No shower. Even after a century, people still hadn’t learned to live by the sun or moon’s guidance. Down here, time felt artificial — days bled into nights until everything blurred together.

Yawning, hungry, unwashed — that’s how most people tracked the hours now. Weiss sighed. Maybe this time it’s good news, she thought. Better than another round of complaints from the residents. I wish we could replace them all with artificials. At least then we’d have some control over the more... irritating traits.

She adjusted her coat, pulled a pen from her pocket, and fiddled absently with her hair until it formed a messy, over-tight blonde bun. Then she continued down the hall.

The doors slid open one after another as Dr. Weiss approached the meeting room. A long stretch of observation glass ran beside the corridor, leading her gaze inward. She slowed, staring into the lab beyond.

Inside, her colleagues moved with an energy she hadn’t seen in months—laughing, clambering over one another for a look. Once her eyes found Unit-187, she understood why.

He stood there, indifferent as always. His face betrayed nothing, yet the wreckage of his body spoke volumes; no expression could hide the ordeal he’d endured.

“My, I have to say—losing only an arm. Once again, luck seems to stick with you,” said one scientist, tightening a new prosthetic into place where his right arm had been.

“Ha!” bellowed another from across the room. “That’s classic tech for you—sturdy stuff. You should’ve seen him when the elevator came up, covered head to toe in blood. That Beast didn’t stand a chance. Got the whole thing on recording.”

“Thank you, Doctor Patterson,” Unit-187 said at last. His tone was flat, perfectly modulated—uncomfortably formal amid a group of people who drank themselves to sleep every night.

“No, don’t thank me,” Patterson replied, his grin stretching. “I should be thanking you. Had you not returned with the gallium, the entire project would’ve been a waste. Nearly a century of work—gone.”",1,1762388717.0,u_XxGunholyxX,0,1.0,False
1opk91h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1opk91h/which_backpacking_stove_is_best_for_beginners/,Which backpacking stove is best for beginners?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting into backpacking lately, and one of the first things I had to figure out was which backpacking stove to buy. I know it sounds simple, but when you start looking, there are SO many options that it gets confusing real fast.

After doing a bunch of research and talking to people who actually know what they're doing, I figured I'd share what I learned. Hopefully this helps some of you who are just starting out.

**What Makes a Good Beginner Backpacking Stove?**

For someone new to camping and hiking, you want something that's easy to use, doesn't cost a fortune, and actually works when you need it. Nobody wants to be fumbling around with complicated equipment when they're tired and hungry at camp.

The best backpacking stoves for beginners are usually canister stoves. They're the ones that screw onto those small fuel canisters you can grab at most outdoor stores. They're super lightweight, light up with a simple push button or match, and cook your food pretty fast.

**My Top Pick**

I personally went with a canister stove, and I haven't looked back. These things are perfect for boiling water for coffee in the morning or heating up a quick meal. They pack down small, which is huge when you're trying to fit everything in your backpack.

If you want to see some solid options that won't break the bank, I found a good selection here: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove

**What About Other Types?**

There are alcohol stoves and wood-burning stoves too, but honestly, those take more practice. Alcohol stoves are super light and cheap, but they're slower and you can't really adjust the flame. Wood stoves are cool because you don't need to carry fuel, but finding dry wood when it's raining isn't fun.

For your first camping stove, stick with something simple. You can always get fancy later once you know what you're doing.

**Things to Think About**

Weight matters a lot when you're carrying everything on your back. Look for something under a pound if possible. Also, make sure the stove is stable enough to hold your pot without tipping over. I learned that the hard way with a wobbly setup my first trip out.

Fuel efficiency is another thing. You don't want to burn through canisters super fast because that gets expensive and adds weight to your pack.

**Final Thoughts**

Starting out with backpacking can feel overwhelming, but getting the right gear makes everything easier. A good portable camping stove is one of those things that's totally worth investing in from the start.

If you're ready to grab one, check out the options here: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove

Trust me, having hot food and coffee on the trail makes every trip better. Good luck out there, and feel free to ask questions if you've got them!",1,1762388702.0,ProductAmazon,0,1.0,False

1opk69e,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1opk69e/my_24m_husband_has_been_dealing_with_mental/,My (24M) husband has been dealing with mental health issues and I (24F) don’t know what to do for him,"Hi everyone! This is my first time posting on Reddit so I’m a pretty nervous to talk about this. 

Just a little back story, my husband and I got married about a year and a half ago and we had been dating for about 3.5 years before getting married. So in total, together for about 5 years. He knew my background with mental health, the fact that I have anxiety myself and that stems from my dad having depression and him going through many depressive episodes when I was still living at home with my parents. My husband and I moved to a different state for his job and this is when I saw my own and his mental health’s declining slightly. We both have recently started going to therapy on our own to work out some childhood traumas and started anxiety medications to help with both of our mental healths. 

Recently, my husband had a major depressive episode where he wasn’t communicating with anyone and called out of work one day. This went on for about 2.5 days. Between some of our friends and myself, we were able to get him to talk about what was going on and what he was thinking/feeling and he seemed to be doing better after that. Obviously, there are some more deep rooted issues that need to be worked out in therapy for him and he admitted to that. Honestly, myself too. 

His depressive episode dug up many thoughts and feelings for me since I had handled my dad going through episodes like this all my life. As a kid, I didn’t realize what was going on with my dad. The more I grew up and matured, I realized what was going on, but it didn’t hurt me as much as it did with my own husband. This made me realize what my mom had to juggle between my dad, my brother and I, and herself. 

Now since my husband’s last depressive episode, everything had been going pretty well up until yesterday. I woke up not in a good mood, not angry at him or anyone, just not in a good mood. I am PMSing so I figured between that, feeling some sort of cold was coming on, and a lack of sleep, I was not in a good mood. My husband asked what I was upset about and I told him “I’m really not upset about anything. Nothing provoked me to be in a bad mood, I just am.” And I did my absolute best to not take my bad mood out on him (he hasn’t said anything so I’m assuming that I wasn’t rude or mean towards him). 

Now this morning, I woke up in a really good mood. Honestly, we both did! We were poking fun with each other while getting ready for the day, we were dancing (more like me dancing and him laughing), having a light and fun conversation on our way home from dropping my car off to get worked on. We got home, let our dog out and fed her, and we were drinking coffee at the kitchen table together. All of a sudden, I could feel his mood shifted. You know when you know a person so well, you can always tell when their demeanor is off, and that’s what I could tell with him. He was texting in his boys group chat and texting one of his other friends that he was supposed to hang out with today. 

I asked him what was going on and that he seemed a little upset. He didn’t say much to me other than the fact that he was supposed to hang out with this friend today but they cancelled because they are leaving for a trip tomorrow and needed to do some chores around the house before they left. He also said that he was in a “heated discussion” with his guy friends about what does and doesn’t need to be on their uniforms for work next week.  After that, he has been upset and kind of standoffish all day. At one point during the morning, I had went and asked him if he was doing okay and he said that he just wanted to be left alone. So that’s what I did. Over the years, I have learned that he is the type of person to come and talk when he’s ready. 

I had an appointment to go to this afternoon and some errands to run so I left and said “bye, I love you!” And he said ”I love you, too” like he normally does. I thought that maybe some time alone and the house to himself might make him feel a little bit better. I came home and he was playing video games with some friends on discord. So I thought that he was doing a little better. 

As soon as I got home, he needed to leave to run some of his own errands (keep in mind, we’re down to one car today) so he left to go do those. He was gone for a couple of hours and came home with comic books (he loves comic books and he goes to his local shop all the time to pick up new comics that he wants to read). So I thought he might be in a better mood. But I was wrong. I made him some food, got him his favorite pop, and was asking him questions about what he was up to on his computer to try and cheer him up. But after a while, I went back to doing my own thing and at about 4:30 in the afternoon, he went to go lay in bed. I went into our room a little while later to see if he was doing alright and/or needed anything and he kind of aggressively said “I’m just tired, I want to go to sleep.” 

This has me worrying that he is slipping into another depressive episode based on what happened a couple of weeks ago or if he is just having an off day. Like I said earlier, I had an off day yesterday and nothing really provoked it, I was just not having a good day. It’s hard for me to tell if he is having an off day or if he is slipping into another depressive episode. 

As I mentioned before, I have dealt with people close to me having depression, but I never learned the correct way to care for someone who is going through an episode or to learn the signs of someone going through a depressive episode. 

I’m just at a loss of what to do. I don’t want to overstep with my husband or cross any boundaries, I just want to make sure that he is doing okay but I don’t know how to communicate to him when he in a bad headspace. Is there anything I should do?",2,1762388505.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I just have nowhere to get this out besides here. I hate the fact that I can’t follow through never follow through with anything unless I’m getting external validation from it all. I started up a coffee roasting business and was doing pretty well with it until I stopped seeing progress and I stopped. I started collecting pokemon cards again but had nobody to share it with and enjoy the hobby with, so I gave up trying to do that. I used to pursue mixing and mastering music but got heavily addicted to drugs back then and couldn’t see anything else/spent all my money and gave up on that. Now that I’m sober and going towards a music career in mixing and mastering again, I’m having doubts in my ability to follow through. I have nobody in my life to talk about the things that I love with, or a mentor to help me move forward in that aspect. I just wish I could follow through with something and actually feel a sense of accomplishment with myself. 

I know it’s not a complaint on life as a whole or anything, but I’m just screaming to the void at this point. I’m sorry if this doesn’t belong here",2,1762388445.0,complaints,5,1.0,False

Whether it's a cup of coffee, small talk, a TV show, food you typically enjoy, all of it either makes me more miserable or I feel no different.

It makes me resent everyone. What's the actual point of anything if I can't even feel the slightest bit of content.

Why are you forcing yourself to talk to me about the most innate useless bullshit when I look visibly miserable and trying to avoid the conversation?
 
You're not going to fix me. I'm so fucked in the head that I can't even remember the last time I felt a positive emotion. 

Fucking sick and tired of the therapists and psychiatrists. They don't fucking care about me, they barely care about doing a good job professionally and they know they can get away with drugging me to high fucking heaven and ""adjusting my behaviors"" which basically boils down to getting me to accept how fucked up my life is through a combination of drugs and lies.

### Training
I followed a 22 week training plan with Runna (after taking some time off in the Spring due to a groin strain while training for a sub 2 half attempt). Beginning of year had hoped to be around 25-30 mpw before training, but ended up around 9-12 mpw.

4 runs a week
Advanced setting

Looking at the plan, including the Marathon, I ran 522.9 miles with 20,046 ft of elevation. 
Average 38.33 ft of elevation per mile I feel prepared me well for the rolling marathon.

My max week was 36 miles (20 mile long run).
Missed one week in August due to fear of stress reaction in my foot. For that week I biked instead. Think I missed 2 other runs (one due to a long day of travel and another due to an extra rest day after long run).

### Looking at Strava Zones

Z5 2m10s

Z4 4h22m

Z3 25h16m

Z2 62h36m

Z1 4h56m


Max heart rate measured by chest strap at end of 10k - 193 bmp
Garmin Threshold heart rate - 172 bpm 8:15 pace

### Supporting workouts:

Strength: 29 sessions

Mobility: 15 sessions

Pilates: 9 sessions (enjoyed these, but couldn't advance quickly enough for the movements)

Stretch & Stability: 10 sessions


I did stop Strength sooner than I would have liked, but I was feeling fatigued and focused on dialing in my sleep.

The Runna plan had started me off estimating Sub 4 (stronger at shorter distance, basing off 10k), but since I never ran sub 2 for a half, figured that was ambitious.

I did accept a few pace adjustments during the program and the final estimate was around 4:20-4:40 (marathon pace 10 min-10:40)

### Other Estimates:

Garmin: 4:16 (when specifying course 4:20)

V.02: 4:08 (based on 1h30min 10 mile b-race)

Runalyze: Optimal 4:12, with current training 4:48

Strava: 4:49

### Pre-race
Tried to follow https://www.featherstonenutrition.com/carb-loading/ for carb loading, but recommended 660 grams, which was just uncomfortable. I got around 450-500 grams. Had my other nutrition in check and slept well each night. Garmin had my Training Status as Peaking starting on Friday before the race and it lasted until race day. Also made sure to hydrate extra in the days leading up. Next time I think I will eat normally and just add some extra carbs.

Morning of I woke at 3:30am to start my day. Had some coffee and a glass of water.

Caught a 6:15am ferry and once seated ate 2 pop-tarts.

Was at the starting village around 7:35am (after the bus got a little lost).
Sat around and wasn't as cold as I expected.
Around 8:30am started feeling a little hungry and had some graham crackers.
I had Salis Endurance Release Electrolytes and a full glass of water around 9:20am
9:45am headed to corrals, and 15 minutes before race had Maurten 100 gel.

### Race
Started in Wave 3 (10:20am), stayed towards the back to not get caught up in crowd/adrenaline.
Felt good for the start and was following the 4:25 pace band. 

Fueling was Maurten gel 160 on the 30s, Torq Energy Gel on the hour. Was also planning to take Bonk Breaker Energy chews at mile 9/10 and 19/20 (Took them at mile 9, but didn't think my stomach could handle at mile 19/20).

Didn't realize the sun was getting to me until it was too late. Around mile 12 I had a ring of pressure feeling around my head, sometimes I get it after a run when wearing a hat, but this time I skipped the hat. I could tell the direct sunlight was getting to me. I was stopping at every hydration station up until this point, getting both gatorade and water (and I had trained with the specific gatorade). And although obviously not enough (or maybe too much), it was enough to make my stomach a bit uncomfortable. In training I had never drank as much (just a couple sips at each mile). Maybe I should have gone every other station.

There was someone I had been keeping pace with through Williamsburg and Greenpoint, but they pulled ahead at Pulaski. That was when I could tell my body was maintaining the effort, but my legs weren't turning over as easily.

Once I made it to the Bronx, I gave up on time goals and let myself walk for a bit to take in a gel. Since by this point I wasn't sure if I would be able to keep anything down. Started running again until mile 24, then walk run to the finish.

Happy I finished, but a bit disappointed in my time given how my training runs felt (including 19 mile progressive long run).

### Post-race
Ended up having 3 extra gels I did not take. The walk out wasn't too bad. Breathing/heart felt fine. Legs a little sore. My groin strain from the Spring popped up again around mile 8, but at a 2 of 10 and never got worse. Don't think I would have been able to push any more than I did.

Now it is Wednesday and I find I have some bounce back in my step. My feet were more sore than my legs (other than walking down stairs). Garmin Training Readiness had been at 1 the past 2 days, but got into the 30s today.

### After the race, estimates updated:

Garmin: 4:15

Strava: 4:39

Runalyze: Optimal 4:10 (with current training, 4:19)

1opjtvr,https://i.redd.it/2s2hff393jzf1.jpeg,My puppy got sick,"Probably my longest night ever in recent years.  And perhaps one filled with the most humbling and memorable lessons. 

My puppy started vomitting on Monday evening. I called her vet immediately and followed his directions. On Tuesday she was better. But on Wednesday she began worsening.

I spent the whole day tending to her and took her to the evening appointment. She was put on iv medication and sent home.

Back home, she began panting heavily and throwing up again. She was severely dehydrated, pale, renching and having trouble breathing.

Her breath rate was over 100 per minute and she could not lay her head down. It was already 10:30 but I made my dad call the vet and he assured us not to panic and just keep her warm and watch her, to bring her back in the morning.

My family did all they can to help, bringing clothes, bringing her water and heater thenwent to sleep one by one but I could never leave my sick puppy alone. 

I sat by her as she breathed in a scarily fast way, looking at my face as if trying to ask me what was happening to her.

I held her head up in my chin which she was pointing up to breathe more easily and I prayed and I fell asleep praying. 

She became restless but she had no energy to move because of the huge water loss she had had all day. She finally pointed her nose to a corner and seemed to sleep. 

Then she woke me up with the sound of her panting again. I provide water which she wouldn’t even look at.

Over the next hours, I took these notes on my phone:

Heavy breathing with inability to lay down or keep head down (100/minute)

- 1 am vomit whitish liquid 

- 1:45 am diarreah little brown liquid and vomit whiteish liquid 

- Breathing rate dropped but still heavy breaths and time to time reaching

- Taking no water still

- 2:15 laid head down 

- Breathing rate 45/ min and renchin 3/min

- 2:18 rolled over to sleep like normal slower breathing and still few renching


- 2:23 slept on side with pretty normal Breathing and occasional renching


- 2:29 got up and smelled water but not drinking and back in sleeping position


- 2:40 vomit very tiny amount of white froth liquid but with a 
lot of strain . (Same for earlier )

- 2:52 vomit same way


- 4 am sleeping

At 5:30 am, my dad woke up and told me to go to sleep and that he would watch her. My puppy was breathing normally now. She was weak and laying still but she moved her head and did not look like she wa suffering like beige. She was laying in her normal position calmly before the heater wrapped in my moms shawl. 

I didn’t really want to, but I was so tired and I would need some sleep to take care of her in the day. I asked my dad if he wants coffee he said no so I came to my room.

As I washed up in the basin, I realised that this night had taught me that yes, I had the capability to love, someone, selflessly. I always doubted this. I doubted that I could love anyone or anything so selflessly. Not even my own friends or family or parents. But this night had proved that love does exist, right inside me and I want it to bloom and show - not just some days like today. But everyday, every moment, every where.

So I know the answer but wanted a better explanation and then solution:

I have one circuit in my apartment and one GFCI on the wall away from the fridge and stove. 

I use a microwave, air fryer, coffee machine, rice cooker and sometimes others. All used at separate times and never simultaneously. 

Can two heavy appliances (heat) like the microwave and air fryer be used at the same time? Or will it always trip the breaker? Current the GFCI needs replacement and it goes all the way to the breaker in the basement. 

Is there a way to have a heavy grade extension cord to plug them all in but only use once?

Is the only solution another GFCI on the same line?

Or is it sorry bud, the kitchen does not have enough fuses and should have been split into multiple. 

Thanks in advance sparkies, just trying to understand best how and why to stay safe. 

In USA.

To invoke the bot, comment anywhere in this sub in the following format:

!boristiers position [player, player, player...]

Where position is a standard position acronym (dst, flex, qb, rb, te, wr) and player, player, player... is a comma-separated list of players for that position. Here's some examples:

!boristiers flex [hunter henry, keenan allen, melvin gordon]   
!boristiers rb [matt breida, tevin coleman]  
!boristiers qb [lamar jackson]  

The bot will reply to your comment with a table of player ranks in the format of {tier}.{position_in_tier} for each of the applicable forms of scoring. If a player is not found / ranked, they'll be denoted as N/A.

**WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

* Do **NOT** reply with only the player name. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.
* Explain why you would start that player.

You wake up tired. You tell yourself you’ll stretch, drink more water, maybe hit the gym — but life hits first. Work. Screens. Stress. Repeat.

The truth? Physical health isn’t just about abs or steps on your watch. It’s about respecting the body that’s been quietly fighting for you every damn day — even when your mind checked out.

Start small. A walk. A deep breath. A glass of water instead of another cup of coffee.
Because your body doesn’t need perfection — it just needs attention.

My ex and I dated for three years in college. We broke up because he wanted to travel and I wanted stability. It hurt but we stayed friends. Good friends. He was at my wedding. My husband knew him, liked him, trusted him.

Fast forward twelve years. Two kids. A mortgage. My husband working sixty hour weeks as an engineer while I stayed home with the kids. My ex moved back to town after a divorce of his own.

We started having coffee. Just catching up. Then the coffees became longer. Then they became lunches. Then one afternoon in his apartment I kissed him and we ended up in bed.

I felt alive for the first time in years. My husband and I had become roommates who occasionally had sex. We talked about schedules and bills and nothing else. My ex made me laugh. He asked about my day. He touched me like I mattered.

The affair went on for four months before I decided I couldn't keep lying. But here's where I really messed up. I convinced myself that honesty meant my husband would understand. That he'd see how much happier I was. That he'd agree to let me have both.

I sat him down one Tuesday night after the kids were asleep. I made tea. I actually made tea like this was a normal conversation.

""I need to talk to you about something,"" I said.

He looked up from his laptop. ""Okay?""

""I've been seeing someone. My ex. For a few months now.""

The color drained from his face. He just stared at me.

""I don't want to divorce,"" I continued. ""I don't want to break up our family. But I need this. I need to feel like myself again. And I think if you really love me, you can accept this arrangement.""

""Arrangement,"" he repeated. His voice was flat.

""Other people do this. Open marriages. It doesn't have to mean anything about us.""

""You cheated on me for four months and now you want permission to keep cheating.""

""It's not cheating if you know about it,"" I said. I actually said that. God.

He closed his laptop. ""Let me get this straight. You want me to stay married to you, help raise our kids, pay the bills, while you go fuck your ex whenever you want.""

""Don't be crude.""

""Answer the question.""

""I want us to evolve,"" I said. ""Marriages don't have to be traditional anymore. We can redefine what works for us.""

He laughed. It was cold and bitter. ""What works for us? You mean what works for you.""

""I'm being honest with you. I'm trying to include you in this decision.""

""There is no decision,"" he said. ""Either I accept being disrespected in my own home or you leave. Those are my options according to you.""

""I'm not trying to disrespect you.""

""But you are. You have been. For months."" He stood up. ""And now you're trying to manipulate me into thinking this is somehow progressive or enlightened. It's not. It's selfish.""

""So you won't even consider it?""

""No. I won't consider watching my wife sleep with another man. Call me old fashioned.""

I got angry then. ""You're never home. You don't talk to me. You don't see me. Maybe if you'd been a better husband I wouldn't have needed someone else.""

That's when his expression changed. Something hardened in his eyes.

""You're right,"" he said quietly. ""I've been working too much. I've been distant. That's on me. But you know what you do when your marriage has problems? You talk about it. You go to counseling. You don't fuck someone else and then demand your spouse be okay with it.""

""I'm not demanding anything. I'm asking you to be open minded for the sake of our family.""

""For the sake of our family?"" His voice rose. ""You're threatening to blow up our family if I don't let you keep your affair partner. That's not open minded. That's emotional blackmail.""

""I never said I'd blow up the family.""

""You said you'd take the kids and leave.""

Had I said that? I couldn't remember. ""I just meant I can't live like this anymore.""

""Then don't."" He picked up his laptop. ""I'll sleep in the guest room tonight. Tomorrow I'm calling a lawyer.""

I panicked. ""Wait. Can't we talk about this?""

""We did talk. You made your position clear. So here's mine. I'm filing for divorce. I'm going to document everything. And I'm going to make sure any judge knows exactly why this marriage ended.""

""You can't do that. Think about the kids.""

""I am thinking about the kids. They deserve a father who respects himself. And they deserve to know that treating people like this isn't okay."" He headed for the stairs then stopped. ""By the way, I want you out of the house within the week. My name's on the mortgage. I've been paying it. You can go stay with your ex since you love him so much.""

I called my ex that night in tears. He'd been saying for weeks that we should be together. That my husband didn't appreciate me. That I deserved better.

""Come stay with me,"" he said. ""We'll figure this out.""

I moved in with him three days later. Took the kids. Felt righteous about it.

My husband filed for divorce immediately. Didn't fight me on temporary custody. Paid child support on time. Was cordial during pickups and dropoffs.

I thought I'd won.

Then two months later, my parents called. They'd had dinner with my husband. He told them everything.

""How could you do this?"" my mother said. ""How could you cheat on that man and then demand he accept it?""

""You don't understand,"" I started.

""We understand perfectly. You're selfish. You've always been selfish but this is beyond anything we imagined.""

My dad wouldn't even talk to me. Just got on the phone to say he was disappointed and hung up.

My sister stopped returning my calls. My brother sent me a text that said ""you're dead to me.""

Friends took sides. Most took his side. I got dropped from group chats. Uninvited from birthday parties.

Turns out people don't like it when you cheat and then act entitled about it. Who knew?

My ex started feeling like a mistake about three months in. Living together was different than afternoon affairs. He was messy. He was moody. He didn't actually want to parent my kids, just wanted the fun parts of having me around.

We fought about money. About his drinking. About how much time he spent on his phone.

One night after a particularly bad fight, I looked at him and realized I'd blown up my entire life for someone I didn't even like that much.

I missed my husband. I missed my house. I missed my life.

So I called him. ""Can we talk?"" I asked.

""About what?""

""About us. About maybe trying again.""

Long pause. ""You're joking.""

""I made a mistake. I see that now. I was selfish and narcissistic and I hurt you. But we have kids together. We have history. Doesn't that count for something?""

""It did count for something,"" he said. ""Past tense. You threw it away.""

""People make mistakes.""

""Mistakes are accidents. You made a choice. Multiple choices. For months. Then you tried to bully me into accepting it. Then you left me. Took my kids. Turned yourself into the victim."" His voice was steady. Calm. ""I'm done. We're done. The only relationship we have now is coparents.""

""Please. I love you.""

""You don't love me. You love what I provided. Stability. Financial security. Respectability. You wanted to have your cake and eat it too and now you're upset there are consequences.""

""That's not fair.""

""Fair?"" He laughed. ""You want to talk about fair? I'll talk about fair at the custody hearing next month. My lawyer's very interested in your living situation with your affair partner. In how you removed the kids from their home. In the texts you sent me trying to manipulate me into an open marriage I never agreed to.""

He hung up.

The custody hearing went exactly as badly as he promised. Judge gave him primary custody. I get every other weekend and Wednesday dinners. I have to pay him child support now.

My ex and I broke up last month. I'm living in a studio apartment. Working retail because I haven't had a real job in twelve years.

My kids are polite to me but distant. My son asked why I left daddy. I didn't know what to say.

My daughter told me she likes daddy's house better because it feels like home.

My husband started dating someone. My son mentioned her. Says she's nice. Makes good pancakes.

That hurt more than anything.

I see now what I did. I see how entitled I was. How narcissistic. I genuinely believed my husband should just accept being disrespected because what, I wanted him to? I thought my happiness mattered more than his dignity. More than my vows. More than my family.

I thought I was being honest and evolved. I was just being cruel.

Every night I lie awake thinking about that conversation. If I could go back I'd do everything differently. I'd go to therapy. I'd work on my marriage. I'd never touch my ex.

But I can't go back.

My husband is moving on. My kids are adjusting. My family won't speak to me. I lost everything because I thought I deserved to have everything.

So given all of this, given how badly I destroyed my own life, am I wrong to still hope maybe someday he'll forgive me?

I moved back to my hometown after the pandemic and left for Seattle last year after a breakup. I knew in my gut Seattle wasn’t the right place for me but I needed a job and wanted to get out of the same legal community as my ex.

I have spent the year missing my friends back home and also longing for the energy and walkability of NYC. I’m an extrovert and the Seattle freeze is real. I like a cozy rainy day inside reading a book but I need way more sun than the PNW provides. 

I’m trying to get back into a niche legal field that I previously practiced in NYC but there are only so many firms there doing this type of work. I interviewed with a Philadelphia firm today and while they have cases in NYC, the position is in office in Philly. As part of working in this field, I have to accept that I may not get a job in NYC.

I admit that I’m a bit of a snob and I’m progressive but I’m also a basic bitch. I like being able to get good beauty services, go to a Pure Barre class, and take a relaxing “hot girl” walk to get my iced coffee and buy too many books at the local bookstore. I previously lived on the Upper East Side and Park Slope. I also plan on getting a dog. I like fashion and while everything doesn’t have to be designer, my style is very much east coast and not PNW.

Three weeks ago, after being a fairly heavy binge drinker for 2 years (one month sober this weekend, and planning on staying that way), I got a major acid reflux episode. No actual heartburn, just crazy pressure and tightness in my chest combined with a feeling like I was about to gag/vomit and it was beyond my control. The only thing that helped was walking, weirdly enough, so the three times it flared up bad I spent four hours pacing the house. It was horrible. 

I was prescribed pantoprazole, 40mg. The first week of taking it was great—no acid reflux, felt fine otherwise, was avoiding acidic foods and coffee but for the most part, felt fine. Then things got real bad, real quick. Chronic debilitating nausea, zero appetite, dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, horrible anxiety, panic attacks, headaches, depression/crying spells for no reason, just AWFUL. I spent five days straight in bed and I’ve been working from home because I can’t leave the house. 

It dawned on me that I have not had the original problem—acid reflux—in over two weeks. What I DO have is every side effect of pantoprazole. Many people’s experiences online mirror mine. I plan to switch to omeprazole tomorrow and slowly wean off. 

Thoughts on this? Has anyone ever experienced something similar? Again, I have never had anything like this in my life—recently did bloodwork and everything is perfect. I appreciate everyone’s input in advance. ",1,1762386685.0,acidreflux,0,1.0,False

Yeah, because Grandma wasn’t blowin’ half her paycheck on $12 iced coffee and avocado toast, that’s why!
Back then, if they wanted coffee, they made it at home. With grounds so strong it could remove rust. You didn’t drink it… you survived it.
And Grandma wasn’t out there “brunchin’.” You think she had time for brunch? No! She was at home, cooking something called whatever’s left in the house.
And don’t even bring up Uber Eats.
These people today are crying about money while living in a 4-bedroom house with two SUVs, six streaming services, and matching sleeve tattoos. You think Grandpa had a tattoo? Yeah it said “Korea, 1951.” And it came with nightmares, not realitic shading.
Oh, don’t even get me started on the kids. “We can’t make ends meet, but Brayden needs the new iPhone!” No, he doesn’t! You’re giving an $1100 phone to a kid who still eats glue and boogers. 
When we were kids, the family phone hung on the wall. It had a cord long enough to jump rope with, and if you wanted privacy, you had to go stand in the pantry. And somehow, we survived.
And the TV? There was one. One. 
It was in the living room, and Dad controlled it. If he wanted to watch bowling, guess what? You liked bowling.
Now every room’s got a 65-inch screen, the baby’s got an iPad, and you’re sitting there wondering why you can’t afford rent. 
Because you’re living like rappers, that’s why!
Grandpa wasn’t out here leasing Teslas and buying $12 smoothies called “Detox Sunrise.” He was driving a truck that sounded like thunder and smelled like oil and cigarettes.
They lived within their means. Whatever Grandpa’s paycheck bought, that’s what they had. They didn’t try to keep up with the Joneses. They were just trying to keep the family fed and a roof over their heads.
So yeah, Grandpa could buy a house on one salary. But he also didn’t have 47 subscriptions and emotional-support crystals. He had one support system, Grandma, who told him to suck it up and mow the yard.
Now folks are broke, tired, and stressed… and it’s not because of inflation… it’s because y’all keep ordering tacos from DoorDash like you’re royalty.

BUT, I’m half asleep and just wanna go code, not sit there with a scale. How do you make single-dose grinders as fast as the hopper ones (where you just press a button and it shoots the grinds into your puck)?

I saw some ppl pre-weigh their beans and put them in little tubes, so maybe that’s promising. 

How many little tubes make up what would go into a typical hopper, and wouldn’t weighing the content for each tube be time-consuming? (I guess you can just weigh 1 tube properly for that coffee, then put beans into the other tubes at around the height of the properly weighed tube).",0,1762386461.0,espresso,31,0.25,False

1opjcsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1opjcsb/i_feel_like_im_being_harassed_by_my_teacher_and/,"I feel like I’m being harassed by my teacher, and I’m a little scared","  I’m not necessarily looking for any advice, but if anyone has any it would be greatly appreciated! I (21 female) am in my freshman year of community college. 
  This all started a few weeks into the semester where my English teacher (older 50s-60s male) asked me to stay after class one day. (He owns a coffee shop along with being a professor) when we were chatting after class he asked me if I would be interested in working in his coffee shop. He said it would be something like an internship but, but it was really just a barista job. He gave me his personal phone number. I did at first say I would be interested to come in on that Sunday to check out the place during an event they were hosting and to maybe shadow one of the employees. As the days were going on I kept getting a worse and worse feeling. So the night before I was supposed to come in he texted me to ask for a time I wanted to come, I then texted him saying I was no longer interested and blocked his number. (I forgot to mention that he would constantly single me out and call on me for almost every question he would ask the class, but I didn’t think much of it at first, and the job at the coffee shop was a private invite to me only and no one else in the class, and had no idea of my previous work experience or anything). 
  After I declined the job offer everything died down up until 2 weeks ago. He started singling me out again and making comments constantly about what I was wearing, talking about sex and other things that didn’t have anything to do with English class. For example last class he was making comments about me taking three hours to get ready ever morning (I always come to class with a little bit of makeup and a put together outfit), made another comment about how people find their partners based on their proximity to each other and said he would have a better chance of dating a former student than someone from Toledo, and then asked me if I knew were Toledo is. (There are so many other things that have happened but this already long post would be even longer). 
  Today was the weirdest of what happened. I was sitting at my desk waiting for him to come in and start class and when he sat down he told me come up to his desk to talk to me. He then handed me his car keys and asked if I could go to his car and grab his phone that he left in the car. I didn’t want to make a scene in front of the class so I just did what he asked. When I came back with his phone he said “thank you so much I owe you a big favor” when I was walking back to my seat and after class I got a few weird looks from two of the girls in my class. I’m so nervous that people are getting the wrong idea of what’s happening and people are thinking there is something going on between us, when there isn’t. I’m afraid if I don’t let this slide I will be punished by him. He kind of puts me in a position where it makes it extremely hard for me to tell him no.",4,1762386427.0,TwoHotTakes,11,1.0,False

1opj2tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicWorkplace/comments/1opj2tk/the_burnout_generation_a_wakeup_call/,The Burnout Generation: A Wake-Up Call,"This is my first post in reddit and I am writing this post not as an expert, but as someone raising their voice from the trenches. A voice that echoes the silent struggles of too many. I am 26 years old. And I am cooked.

That phrase, ""I am cooked,"" might sound dramatic. But it perfectly captures the exhaustion, the disillusionment, and the profound fatigue that has become the unwelcome companion of my daily life. I graduated from a Tier-1 B-School with a PGDM, a degree that promised a bright future. My bachelor's degree was earned with flying colors. I started my career at ABC Company with ambition, with energy, with hope. That was three and a half years ago. Today, that hope feels like a distant memory, replaced by a relentless grind.

Let me paint a picture. Imagine working for a company where simply asking for permission to step away from your desk is met with suspicion. We are allotted two permissions per month. But here's the catch: your manager must deem it ""necessary."" I once had to present my grandfather's death certificate, and my father's birth certificate, just to prove the lineage and justify my need for leave. My manager stood beside me, scrutinizing these deeply personal documents, before granting permission. This isn't about policy; it's about a culture that treats its employees like cogs, not human beings with lives outside the office walls.

Then there are the shifts. Rotational shifts that twist your biological clock into knots. One week, 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM. The next, 10:30 PM to 7:00 AM. Then, 2:00 PM to 10:30 PM. What does this mean for life? It means that when I finish my 2:00 PM to 10:30 PM shift, my dinner options are limited to fast-food joints. Healthy eating? A luxury I can't afford. My body, once resilient, now protests with every changing cycle. Sleep cycles are obliterated. Routines are non-existent. The stress is immense. I rely on two, three, sometimes four cups of coffee a day just to stay attentive. It’s a desperate attempt to combat the constant fatigue.

This isn't just about feeling tired. This excessive burnout and fatigue has pushed me to a dark place. I've developed anxiety disorder. I'm battling depression. I spend at least 4,000 rupees a month on a psychiatrist, money that keeps me barely afloat. When I return to my room after a shift, sleep doesn't come easily. My mind races. I lie awake, wrestling with insomnia, while thoughts of former peers, seemingly living their best lives, flood my mind, pushing me further into the shadows. I ask myself: When was the last time I felt normal? When was the last time I was truly happy? When was the last time I had a good night's rest? Even halfway through the week, I feel utterly depleted. The fatigue is a pervasive killer. I suffer from restless legs syndrome, a constant torment that makes me fantasize about chopping off my own legs just for a moment of peace.

And the effort? The countless hours, the dedication, the commitment I pour into my work? It's met with zero recognition. A simple ""well done"" feels like an impossible dream. Where are the core values, the inspiring vision, the mission statements that describe how much an organization supposedly loves its employees? These seem to exist only on polished brochures, not in the everyday reality of a workplace.
For the past year, I've been trying to escape. To make a jump to another company. But the market is tough. Companies are hesitant to hire. And this brings me to a point of profound frustration. My company spends lakhs of rupees on annual parties at five-star or even seven-star hotels. Lavish events with expensive food and flowing drinks. Imagine, for a moment, if that money, just a fraction of it, were invested differently. What if it went into a decent hike for employees? What if it was used to improve working conditions, to provide proper support? I believe that would boost morale far more than a single night of excess. Why prioritize temporary revelry over sustained employee well-being and a fair compensation?

At 26 years old, an age when I should be brimming with potential, with energy, with excitement for the future, I feel utterly wasted and utilized like a piece of tissue paper. My story, I know, is not unique. It's a reflection of a systemic issue where profit often overshadows people, where burn-out is normalized, and where the human cost of relentless productivity is ignored. This isn't just about me. It's about all of us who are feeling the squeeze, who are silently struggling. It's a call for a fundamental re-evaluation of how we work, how we value our employees, and how we build sustainable, humane workplaces.

1opiwlt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opiwlt,Coffee Cabinet,"Technically this isn’t finished yet but it has to wait until spring for stain or painting, haven’t decided what yet. 

I’m forever in a spot of never enough counter space, but also no longer wanted the cheap rolling shelf tables we had. So, for my second project build I decided to tackle a coffee cabinet. 

As a SAHM to two under two I decided to do this as cheap as I could since I know my children will end up destroying anything nice right now. (Look crayons already met the cabinet) 

Wood used:
2x4 white pine
1/4 Sanded plywood 
1x12 common board 
1x4 common board 

Tried my hand at box joints, table saw and chisels. First one was terribly done. So remade one leg. Tried to slide the plywood in with hand chiseled slots, went terribly wrong and just filled those in with wood filler and nailed the plywood into the back. 

I learned a lot, my doors aren’t square and are a tad short. But I did all of this with the kids hanging with me, outside sanding, most cuts was running to the pole barn for a cut and running back in, or using the circular saw on the deck and all glue up was done in the house with kids trying to hand off it 🤣 all in all I’m actually happy with it. This winter I’ll stick to learning and practicing joints and picture frames.

So I’m on day 5 of a 6 day house sit and after waking up and feeding the pup, getting coffee, etc. that my stomach was itchy. I scratch and then realize… I have 3 bug bites in an L shape around my belly button. The day before i noticed that I had a bug bite on my foot but had walked out onto the patio barefoot and didn’t think much of it. 

So I immediately tore all the sheets off and went spelunking in around the bed and couch. Not a single sign of bed bugs. Mattress pad, sheets, duvet, pillows, couch, throw blankets… no signs that I can point to. Mattress was in great shape, no signs around crevices of bug life at all. 

Also checked the pup for signs of fleas and found none. For what it’s worth, the house has been incredibly clean (though I know bedbugs don’t discriminate) and me and the dog have spent a lot of time going on walks, hanging out in the backyard, etc. since it’s been unseasonably warm. My stomach has always been covered though, unless my sweatshirt shifted up in my sleep. 

I have no proof of bed bugs and 1 night left in my stay. I’ve been home before I was bitten to swap clothes so if there’s been exposure… then it’s already happened. I can throw away the backpack and shoes I’ve worn, and heat treat the remaining clothes. 

I’ll mention to the owner I got bit, but I think im going to finish the final 24 hours of the stay… am I crazy? Theres a chance it’s not bed bugs right?? Definitely not sleeping on the bed but I have no clue how to handle this. ",1,1762385055.0,RoverPetSitting,4,1.0,False

I still until this day don’t know which one but they just fucked my life. Since then: 2 times been to the Emergency Service with 130 heart beats. When this comes I am shaking and everytime thinking I am dying. I have food intolerances; coffee, alcohol, chocolate, oranges and almost all fruits, beans, gluten, dairy so everything except couple of stuff. I can not eat anymore before I think “oh this is gonna mess me up”. 

I am 29, I barely have an energy, non-stop back and muscle pain, I am tense and restless just this feeling that something bad is gonna happen anytime is there. There is even more but I stop here.

So as you can imagine under this conditions I am very often sick, I can not go to work like a normal person because I just don’t have this energy. I am sooo sick of people not understanding me including the closest people around me, the guilty feeling whenever I get sick leave, the feeling of what people think about me, the feeling of when is my next panic attack feeling comes. I am CONSTANTLY under some kind of stress that I don’t even know what causes. I can just tell you that I am feeling SICK all the fucking time, I am so restless, I can not relax. I am so sick of seeing my colleges staring at me because I am so often sick. I got mobbing during my studies that I have been doing for the last 3 years because I was the one who couldn’t follow up the classes as others did. I am crying all the time, like I never did before in my life. I am just soo fucking tired.. so tired that I can not even express it properly. I am writing these after a very bad heart palpitation in my sleep, I woke up was dizzy, didn’t feel my body, my heart was beating so fast that I am sure anyone could have heard it next to me. I was shaking and so afraid that I immediately ran to the door to wake up my neighbours because I thought this is really the end. Everytime the same scenario, every day I have to think about death. This is midnight here and I suppose to wake up 06.00 a.m. in the morning plus I have a non healing flu for the whole last month and I have to think about all those sick leaves. I just can’t anymore, I am at a point thinking what is the point of living like this anymore. I feel like I lost my body and soul together. I am a whole new person that I don’t like. As I said, I still unfortunately don’t know what caused it all, covid or antibiotics or both.. 

After an half an hour of crying session I thought about writing here hoping that anyone maybe could understand/help me. I tried thousands of stuff but seems like all like temporary solutions. I just want my life before, I just want old me.

Not sure if this belongs here or r/relationship_advice, but I’m having a hard time and just wanted to put this into words somewhere.

Married 4 years. We have a toddler and a younger one ( 8 )Since the birth of our second child, things have been really different. I’ve read a lot about how hormones, identity shifts, and even brain structure can change during and after pregnancy. I do believe postpartum can affect someone deeply. I understand some of what she’s feeling is probably real and heavy.

But I’m struggling to separate what might be postpartum from what has just become… mean. The negativity, the short fuse, the tone, the way she speaks to me and sometimes to our older child. It’s gotten to the point where it feels hostile in our own home. I’ve always hated people that had terrible behaviors because they are “hangry” or just didn’t “have coffee” 

For context, I work hybrid  part of the week out of the house, part at home. I’m very hands-on with the kids, house, appointments, errands, bedtime, meals — all that. She works per diem but mostly stays home with the kids, which I’ve always supported and never pressured. I’ve tried to be extremely patient and understanding, and I’ve offered gently (not pushing) that she could talk to someone, or we could go together. My insurance covers therapy really well. She just isn’t open to it.

Here’s the part that scares me to admit: I’m starting to resent her. Like, really resent her. To the point where I sometimes feel like I hate how she treats me. And I’ve always had a low tolerance for unkindness in general, even when people try to justify it by being tired, hungry, whatever. So I’m stuck in this place where I lose empathy towards the term postpartum - how do I know when it’s a cope out or real ? ",1,1762384821.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1opipf5,https://i.redd.it/pezfimisuizf1.jpeg,What if they made the new Black Panther significantly younger?,"(Don't mind the cover, just thought about what would fit best for the topic)

At the end of BP2, we learn that T'Challa had a secret son (conveniently also named T'Challa). Toussaint, as he appears in the movie, could not have been older than 12, and with current rumors about Damson Idris being cast in the role, it is likely that they'll use the multiverse wackiness of Doomsday and/or Secret Wars to bring in an new T'Challa (whether or not Idris gets the role). While I have no problems with this personally, there is a unique opportunity to bring in a new, younger BP that is closer to the current timeline. But you might ask, ""why would they do this?""

1.) The idea is not entirely novel; a younger Black Panther (or, a young T'Challa) has been explored in comics before. While the quality of said content may vary, it is still notable enough that they would have aspects to pull from in existing media should they wish to go that route.

2.) The MCU is in a transition phase, with the ""Young Avengers"" having been teased for quite a while now. Casting a BP in his 20s would mean that he would still fit the Young Avengers lineup, while also being groomed for a bigger overall role moving forward.

3.) Narratively, it fits the timeline quite well. It has already been established in Civil War that the King and the Black Panther can be different entities, as T'Challa was the BP when T'Chaka was king up to the latter's death. Allowing Shuri to take the throne while passing on the BP mantle to T'Challa Jr. would be a narratively efficient and tasteful way to ensure that we get a new BP, while also not just completely replacing Chadwick's T'Challa Sr. by way of multiverse magic. This also allows Shuri's character an opportunity to grow and be a key piece of the mythos instead of being just relegated to side character again.

4.) With the X-Men incoming and with the assumption that they'll be casting younger, they have an opportunity to do the T'Challa-Ororo pairing. I know people have mixed reactions on this one, but an African superhero power couple in mainstream films would not only be great for representation, it would be a great opportunity to explore a pairing that has never been seen on the big screen (and an opportunity to repair the damage that has been done to said pairing).

Of course, there are cons to this. The biggest one would be who to cast. T'Challa is a huge role especially coming of Chadwick's iteration, and to put all that on a young, potentially unseasoned actor is a monumental task. Then again, Damson Idris, who is the main name circulating right now, is ""only"" 34, so they could stretch him to be in his late 20s. Other younger actors like Caleb McLaughlin and Toheeb Jimoh come to mind, both of whom are great actors under 30.

There's also the issue of what media or comics to pull from. While I'm sure they could do it if they tried, writing a story for T'Challa in his prime as king would mean there is much more existing content to borrow from as compared to if they did a younger version.

I’ve searched for solutions and didn’t find anything.  I called Yeti and they’re sending a replacement lid but it will do the same thing so I spent more time trying to troubleshot my leaking out of the mouth piece of the lid and I tried the brand new backup lid that I bought and it did the same thing as far as leaking.  Looking close at the threaded side of the lid directly opposite of the mouth piece where the rubber gasket hits on the inside of the lid.  When you slide it back and forth looking closely you can see the thin lip of that rubber gasket on the leading edge get hung up and fold over a little on the bottom side of the hard plastic mouth piece.  I’ve slid this back and forth a bunch of times and saw it hang up each time.  That’s when it leaks. 

If you take it apart and put it back together in the closed position so you don’t have to slide it, it’s doesn’t leak.  So I played with it for a bit and was able to repeat it getting hung up just by opening an closing like normal.  I was going to gently taper/file that edge of the inside mouth part of the hard plastic lid so the rubber gasket wouldnt get hung up on it like it was.  

I kept playing around with it and now it’s sealing more than not and I didn’t do anything so I’m not sure why the change.  I’ve been testing with hot water from the Kuerig, I’ll test with coffee tomorrow to see if that matters.  

It also seems like if I close the magslider slower that it doesn’t hang up so that may be a work around as well.  I’m going to keep testing it.  

I do have the 16oz rambler with commuter lid as the backup as that is officially “leak proof” so we’ll see if I eventually switch to that as my goto anyway or stick with the 20oz Rambler with stronghold lid.",2,1762384676.0,YetiCoolers,2,1.0,False

*Do you want to speak with the ghosts of Denny Park?*

*Have you ever seen a black sun through Black Hole Sun?*

 

Come join us for an Ubran fantasy campaign set right here in Seattle!  Delve into the underground, fight to protect the city, wear a hoodie!  We need one or two stalwart adventurers to join our level 5 party.

Tl;dr

**Who:** You (21+, chill)  Us (3 players, 1 dm, also chill)

**Where:** Maple Leaf (in-person)

**When:** Monday nights, 6:30ish - 10:15 or 10:30 PST

**What:** 5e 2024 Urban Fantasy set in Seattle, level 5

**Why:** That's up to you!

The Long Part 

**Who should respond?** Anyone 21+ with an interest in playing cooperative D&D and the willingness to commit to weekly games. All experience levels welcome. **We are absolutely inclusive and welcome people all people.**  **You should too.** Please be vaccinated.

**The Cast:** 3 players and me, the DM. We're 20s-30s (ok 40) folk, different professions and lifestyles. Mixed genders, identities, and backgrounds.  Our cleric recently stepped away and we're looking for a new player or two. 

**Logistics:** We play in-person on Monday nights after work, ideally starting at 6:30 and running till 10:15. I generally host the game in Maple Leaf.  Someone usually brings dinner or snacks. We use discord for scheduling and gossip, among other things. Sessions will run with a player or two absent, depending on the plot. 

**Play Style:** It's about a 60-40 split between roleplay and combat. RP is generally done in-character, silly voices are optional. Combat is tactical and played on battle map. I build set pieces and terrain when the mood strikes. The table is fundamentally cooperative, and spotlight hogging, lone wolf gameplay, and being a jerk are discouraged. Character design needs to support this playstyle. 

**Setting:** Modern Urban fantasy set in modern Seattle, bit this is a city with two faces. Rain City is the mundane world we all know and love, but the Gifted or Cursed may be able to see the Emeral City, a realm of spirits, creatures, and magic.  Crust Punk Paladins go drinking with the spirits of craftsman houses. Power and secrets swirl through the streets of both worlds while mages and dark creatures fight to determine who gets to shape reality.  The party is currently exploring a wrecked ship in the deep reaches of an unending fantasy Costco. 

**Tone:** We try to keep things on the lighter side with room for deeper dramatic roleplay and character development, definitely not gritty or grimdark. Expect a PG-13 or R, there's colorful language and adult humor, but no sadism or explicit sex. (Think LotR or Dimension 20). We'll also have a further discussion on lines and veils as part of the interview process.

**Content:** The system is pretty much straight 5e 2024. with a few quality of life changes. Official content is generally okay. Some spells are banned or limited for balance reasons. Adding flavor and flair are encouraged in character design. I'm totally open to collaborative worldbuilding and may introduce some related mechanics.

**The Future:** I don't know where or when the campaign will end, that's up to you.  This is the second campaign for the group and we all get along quite well, so there isn't really an end in sight.

 

**Process:**

1. Fill out the survey at [https://forms.gle/LGJfJKwL6aaDHthb7](https://forms.gle/LGJfJKwL6aaDHthb7)
2. Message me with any questions you have. I'll be reviewing and replying to responses in the order they're received.
3. We'll get a cup of coffee or something and chat in a little more depth about the game and what you're looking for.
4. Some kind of complicated group decision making process and probably a meeting with the whole group.

I am seeking friends of both genders close in age to explore the city with. I used to go to boystown and club a lot when I was in my early 20s and have slowed down since. 

I am looking to spark that once again but also love to just get drunk and go out to dinner. I am 420 friendly and get along with the gays and straight girlie pops & boys.

Maybe a health hobby like going to the gym, coffee, shopping etc 

I am a small bussiness owner too so if you need candles - I’m your plug <3

Hope to hear from you!

1opifx4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opifx4,What color couch should we get?,"My husband and I moved into his folk's old place this year and inherited their furniture along with it. We've been slowly replacing things and are finally ready to tackle the living room. *(I realize it looks kinda insane right now!)*

**Our first big task is to replace the couch, but I'm having trouble deciding on the right style, particularly the color.** It will have to be comfortable, cleanable, and last a long time. Ideally will have a chaise. We are planning to use Dreamsofa. My ideas so far:

I tend to gravitate towards **warm eclectic/japandi/MCM** and I think that could fit the bones of the house well (example photos above).

1. I keep picturing something **green**, but I'm worried it may look too dingy or dark, or that I'm just being influenced by what's trendy lol. 

2. The room has low ceilings and isn't particularly bright, so I'm realistically leaning towards a (please don't kill me) **warm beige or grey**, similar to what's pictured now but slightly brighter and in a more modern style.

**FWIW:** We will replace the coffee table, TV console, and rug next. And yes, everything is cluttered, and no, I can't get rid of most of it (as a minimalist living with ""non-minimalists"", I have already negotiated as much as I can for now). My MIL is essentially storing her furniture in the dining room area since she downsized, so it has to stay for now.

I’ve tried multiple other drinks that have been recommended to me from here and usually take one or two sips and either give it to my husband or throw it out- it’s literally never good. I tried the cookie butter latte today and even tried it “half sweet” and it basically just tasted like slightly sweet sugar milk with a stale coffee aftertaste. I don’t even think they use espresso for it because he made it in like two seconds. Maybe they just pour in pre brewed coffee? The foam on top came out out of a can? 🤮 When I was ordering it I asked him if it was a really sweet drink and he said, “I have no idea because I don’t drink coffee.” Anybody have an iced drink they highly recommend here?
