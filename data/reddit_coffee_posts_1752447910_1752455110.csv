1lz94gc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lz94gc,My trip report 7/5/25-7/12/25,"First of all, many, many thanks to all of the contributors of this subReddit. I planned my trip almost exclusively using this sub, Google Maps and the videos by Jason in Paris on YouTube. This was my first trip to Europe.

We stayed at the Hotel De l'Academie Saint Germain. We exclusively walked or used public transportation (only train) all but three times. Our hotel offered airport pick up via private car for €75 to and €70 from. We did that and took one Uber. (Be sure to change the currency in your Uber app to euros if you’re using a no-foreign-transaction-fee card. Uber charges 1 1/2% conversion rate if you book in US dollars.)

Our trip started with (Delta) losing my main clothes bag for nearly 48 hours. I learned that there’s no pants in Paris that are cut to length unless you find an American brand, nor many selections over 34W size. On top of that, the prices are 50 to 80% more than you’d pay in the US. I arrived wearing shorts, but we had dinner reservations that required pants. Nearly 5 hours & €300 later (which I hope to be reimbursed) I had clothes to wear. 

Our activities included Musée d'Orsay, Arc de Triomphe, Musée du Louvre (via private tour), reservations at The 43-Roof Top, a Le Calife dinner cruise, day trip to the Tour de France in Rouen, walked around the Eiffel Tower, and a Linkin Park concert at Stade de France. Plus, I got engaged. She said yes!!! Our favorite day was the Tour de France. Our least favorite was the Louvre (too crowded). Loved the Arc, the Orsay, the dinner cruise, the Roof top, walking around the tower & Linkin Park. 

We went to about 5 Boulangeries. All were fantastic. We came home with some butter, some Get 27, some macaroons and Dijon. We drank in pubs Met some fantastic people. We did 16,500 steps a day, on average. 

Cons, for me, as an American: The hotel room was small, no ice hardly anywhere, no fountain beverages, limited public bathrooms (even pay ones), narrow sidewalks & a lot of places that didn’t have A/C. Bars don’t have seats at the bar all the time. You need a Pub. Also, seems to be a lot of folks who don’t smell very pleasant. Small sidewalks. 

Pros: I loved the Metro/subway system. Couldn’t believe we got out of Stade de France so quick on the Metro. Super easy to get anywhere. And cheap. Get a Navigo Easy card. Add balance with your phone. Appreciated how direct the French people were. Everyone was kind and to the point. Had so many fun interactions with locals in Paris & Rouen. The bread, the butter, the coffee, the cheese, the chocolate.. loved it all. Honestly thought the prices were fine. It’s expensive but nice seeing tip & tax included in everything. Only asked at 2 places to tip. Tipped at 6 places when I thought I needed to. Most people spoke good enough English to get by. 

We did a lot, but we had days spaced out where we rested some. We are a fairly non active couple around 40 yo. We felt sore some days but nothing we couldn’t handle. 

I only saw the clipboard scam once. Didn’t witness any other crime or questionable activity. - Besides what seemed to be a threat at the TdF. Some cops ran up the sidewalk and passed a long gun to another officer basically over my head on the road. It was scary for a sec. Turned out to be a false alarm. 

Any questions? Ask away. 

TL/DR. I planned my own trip and did a lot of touristy stuff on my first trip to Europe as an American. ",2,1752454990.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False

ive been shockingly successful in just a few days. got a few matches on her and taimi and have vague plans to meet some of them, and actually met a cute sweet trans guy on grindr super close to me who im going out with this week. its made the hundreds of chasers sending me old man dick pics worth it.

im just nervous as hell. i haven't been on a ""real"" date since i was like 16 and i have no idea what im gonna do. were going out for coffee and a little trail hike because i wanted to be able to talk but now im horrified that i wont be able to fill the space, like whats to like about a neet tranny? idk hopefully he likes me, hes so talented (hes a musician) and cute and i just hope i can live up to his standards.

any dating advice from my fellow 🚂🦵s? how do i make people like me? 😭

Thanks for your help! Wondering if you can critique my last-minute trip itinerary for prague/vienna/budapest +/- salzburg and Hallstatt

I'm in my late 20s, vegetarian, solo travelling for the first time. Want to balance sight seeing with safety and not overdoing it. 

Please let me know if you have any vegetarian food recommendations, safe and clean hostel or hotel recommendations good for a solo traveller, or other tips!

Thank you very much :)

1lz8zz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1lz8zz6/please_give_me_every_pro_spanking_biblical/,Please give me every pro spanking biblical argument you have.,"Please, everyone, give me your best pro-spanking arguments for child discipline so I can better understand this position. I sense I am missing a lot, as spanking is a newer idea to me, and I feel like I must be missing a lot of the rationale behind it because it just doesn't make sense biblically. I am very much pro child discipline but do not think spanking is a form of discipline the Bible condones.

Spanking is something my (newish) church believes in strongly, and it came up in a discussion between me and one of my friends there. We are going to get together for coffee later, and this topic is likely going to come up.

I have a lot of biblical reasons for thinking spanking is wrong, but I don't want to belabor all of them, so I will only discuss the 4 verses in Proverbs that are “pro-spanking,” as these are the only ones I can find in the entire Bible that seem to directly discuss the topic, but I think these verses are clearly anti-spanking (with one extreme exception), and I will briefly explain why so people can speak against my reasoning.



>Proverbs 13:24 ""Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.""

This is the most common verse used (partly due to a famous poem); the verse really hinges on the word ""discipline."" The pro-spanking argument seems to rely on a conflation of ""spanking"" with ""discipline,"" and that conflation is the major problem I see in the discourse of this topic. The Hebrew word is מוּסָר or ""Musar,"" which in all my study means instruction, correction, and moral guidance, but nowhere can I find it to mean physical striking of any kind.

The word ""rod"" gives the image of striking with the rod, especially when you conflate it with the word ""discipline,"" but the verse doesn't tell parents to strike their child; it tells parents to discipline or morally guide them. The Hebrew word for ""rod"" is שֵׁבֶט ""shevet,"" which is literally a shepherd's rod or a scepter referring to royal authority or leadership. It feels very clear that the verse is stating that whoever relinquishes authority hates their child, especially with the next part of the verse not speaking of physical violence but diligent guidance. The rod could be used by a shepherd for physically correcting sheep, but that seems like an exception during my study of the topic. If the verse said ""whoever spares the hammer,"" the verse would not make you think to spank children because although a hammer could be and sometimes is used to hit someone, its main use is outside of violence and makes the meaning of the verse connected to the main use of the item, not an ancillary use for one of the meanings of the word, especially when the second part of the verse doesn't connect the item to a unique use of the item but the opposite.

>2. Proverbs 22:15 ""Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.""

This verse is similar, the rod and discipline taken from Hebrew do not seem to be talking about physical violence, and that only happens when you conflate the word ""discipline"" with ""spanking."" ""The rod of moral guidance,"" ""the rod of instruction,"" and ""the scepter of correction"" clearly show a different teaching than spanking, and in my mind make the understanding of the last verse more clear that it is not speaking to physically striking a child.

>3. Proverbs 23:13–14 ""Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with a rod, he will not die. If you strike him with the rod, you will save his soul from Sheol.""

This is the only verse that shows an exception to spanking/striking a child. The first part follows with the word ""Musar,"" which means moral teaching. The second part speaks to striking them with a ""Shevet"" he will not die, but the verse clearly says ""if,"" not ""should."" It then goes on to say ""if"" you will save his soul. If this is how we are supposed to raise children, the verse would say ""should"" or give a command of some kind rather than an ""if"" statement. Now if my child is running into traffic, yes, it is ok to hit them to prevent them from getting hit by a car.

I think this ultimately becomes a very nuanced discussion that this post is already too long to dive into, but I feel this verse is clearly speaking to an extreme exception of what to do rather than a clear directive in parenting. Also notice this is the only verse that uses the word ""strike""; the other verses do not say to strike your child but to use the rod, and the one time it talks about striking, it says ""if"" and is about saving them from death, not everyday discipline of children.

>4. Proverbs 29:15 ""The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.""

The last verse I can find. The first part is just a true statement that guidance (even if it intends to be harsh) and criticism do give wisdom, but this verse is a warning, not an instruction. The verse is saying that although these methods of parenting give wisdom, if you alienate the child, he will bring shame. The verse is warning parents that even things that can bring wisdom must be used with care, as breaking the bond of parenting will bring destruction.

\--------------

Outside of these verses I cannot find an argument for spanking in the Bible and many that insinuate against it, but that's why I am bringing up this topic, so please provide verses or themes I may be missing as well.

To be clear, I am not anti-child discipline, as I think that is extremely important, but spanking is not the biblical way to raise children.",1,1752454638.0,TrueChristian,0,1.0,False

Here is the profile of my latest roast. This is a washed Colombian beans from the Cauca region, produced by the COSURA cooperative. This is the first time I have roasted them. I was aiming for a light roast so that it could be drunk as filter coffee. The roasting went as planned, about a minute after first crack and a 4-degree increase.

After 10 days of resting, I tried it in a V60 and it was very good. For the next roast, I plan to try a slightly shorter and slightly longer roast to compare and see if it can be better.

Looking at the curve, do you have any advices or ideas for exploration/improvement?

The picture of the beans is for reference, it's a bit overexposed, ",1,1752454601.0,FreshroastSR800,0,1.0,False

1lz8z4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1lz8z4j/ready_bat_review_of_manual_not_included_chapter_2/,Ready Bat Review of “Manual Not Included” - Chapter 2: Mom Boss,"Hola pepinos! Hopefully you’re in the mood to hear Hillary [Yes I Am a White Girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/173hd07/non_apology_video_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Baldwin tell us what an amazing mother she is, all while framing it in a trite, tired, wannabe cutesy reference to one of Alec’s movie roles, “Boss Baby”

In the hard copy printed version, this chapter is 26 pages with a full-page Rou Shoots family chaos picture from 2023 and three half page pictures (more on those choices later). Her chapters have no subheadings, but I wrote my own, which I quite like.

**Women Should Support Women, Gaissss**

* Predictably, Hillary opens with a few paragraphs about the power of a mother’s love: ***“While we may come to motherhood in different ways—adoption, surrogacy, giving birth, stepparenting, guardianship—whatever route we take, we are united by our desire to give all the love we have to another being. It’s an animal instinct that some of us have: an excess of love that we need to pour into someone else…There is no hierarchy with the label “mother,” for all motherly love is equal, regardless of the path.”*** All foam, no beer.
* Once she builds her case that moms love their kids (sigh), she gets to her real purpose in this chapter: how terribly she has been treated by other women, moms in particular: ***“As women, motherhood bonds us in so many ways, but I’ve also found that it can be an extremely competitive and judgmental space. This is a pain that we probably all know too well and is one of the themes I would like to tackle in this chapter. Can we open up the parameters of “mother” and allow people to use the term without judgment? We all just want to do what is best for our kids: It’s hard enough as is, so why do we need to make it harder on each other? Have I judged? Yes. Have I misunderstood people? Yes. Have I been judged and misunderstood by others? One hundred percent yes.”***
* Let me borrow Hillary’s trick of posing a rhetorical question no one is actually asking:  do I think Hillary loves her kids? Yes, I do. Do I think she’s a good parent? No, I do not. This is based on her choice to monetize them on TV and social media to build a brand (such as it is) off of them, the way she parentifies Carmen and allows her to act and look much older than her years, and her inability to provide boundaries and discipline for any of her kids.
* It’s quite pathetic that what Hillary rilly, rilly wants is a public life with zero accountability or consequences attached and heaps of praise because she is a legend in her own tiny mind. Dr. Kathy and Señor Dave, come get your kid - you all created this petulant woman-child who is now insisting that she is la víctima de los boollies.

**Hillary is the Best Breastfeeding Mami (but Formula is Great!)**

* She continues: ***“What I’ve learned from having children is that there are a million different ways to mother. I don’t want to make things harder for my fellow moms by opening my mouth to preach about how things “should” be done. I do my best now to resist being judgmental, gossipy, and competitive.”*** And yet, she is judgmental, gossipy, and competitive right here on these flimsy pages!
* Case in point: she drones on and on about breastfeeding and giving Rafa formula because it’s fine! The breast or bottle debate just oppresses women! You do you! Then this silly sausage details how she worked like the dickens and ***“I tricked my body into thinking that I had more than one baby drinking milk… With the last four babies, I had four giant freezers entirely filled with milk. People would ask me, “What are you going to do with all that milk?” And I’d say, “They will drink it! They will drink it because I made it!” And, for the most part, they have.”***
* Y’all, she truly is a chaos goblin. If baby formula is fine, why was she competing to produce the most breast milk ever? Why is she detailing her demented three minutes per hour pumping routine and touting how she carried her stupid pump everywhere included the Botanic Gardens where she now knows where every outlet is? Answer: because she is judgmental and competitive and has clear ideas about what makes “a good mom.” And you know what? I could give a rat’s butt about Hillary’s breastfeeding journey. My bone of contention is that she clearly has a point of view about breastmilk being better and – here’s the kicker – she cannot see that having the ability to do nothing but pump and wander around NYC pumping because she doesn’t work or actually take care of her many kids full time is a flex. Her narrative is unrealistic and designed to make her look like a supermom. I would say she 100% wins the rich, skinny, out of touch, neurotic mom prize, hands down.

**Hilz Loved Ireland Day One and Made Damn Sure Alec Knew It**

* According to Hilz, she was just a wide-eyed innocent when she met Alec and had no clue what blended families might be like: ***“My only real points of reference to stepparenting were the evil stepmothers in Disney movies and fairy tales.”*** For a person raised with [no TV or pop culture](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/11rdazq/i_knew_no_pop_culture/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), she sure loves her some Disney.
* Hillary is not book smart, but she is a sly and wily gal. Early on, she assessed that Alec had a lot of guilt about Ireland and decided to frame herself as a self-sacrificing hero to win Alec’s admiration: ***“I had tremendous respect for family and didn’t want to cause any harm. So, before I met his daughter Ireland for the first time, I told Alec that if she didn’t like me or didn’t feel comfortable with me, I would go my own way and not continue seeing him.”*** How ju say, so noble?
* She claims that Ireland’s experience about having half siblings starting at age 18 is her story to tell but ***“my children love their big sister and love being tios/tias to Ireland’s daughter, Holland.”*** Holy schmoly, her grip on the grift is tighter than Alec’s grip on Lorne Michael’s good graces.

***Hillary Didn’t Know How Babies Were Born***

* I think in this section Hillary is aiming for readers to feel compassion for her years as a young ingenue who was scared and unprepared for motherhood. Ok, fair goal, but because she is spectacularly unself-aware, I mostly felt exasperated by her dumb ass.
* Alec was very clear that he wanted more kids, so Hillary happily complied and got pregnant with Carmen five months after they married. She reports: ***“excited and terrified, I immediately went to our local bookstore and bought What to Expect When You’re Expecting. I asked for it to be giftwrapped, pretending it was for someone else while attempting to keep my pregnancy a secret. (The salesperson told me years later that she’d known, and we had a good laugh about how I thought I was being super-stealthy.) I didn’t actually finish reading the book, because it was filled with worst-case scenarios.”***  A missed opportunity to tie her inability to finish a book (like, ever) to her “ADHD” and “dyslexia,” no?
* She continues: ***“The more I read about pregnancy, the more my twenty-eight-year-old self discovered that it is really scary and lots of bad things can happen! So I decided to drop the research, figuring it was a situation that was probably going to go in only one direction. When you get to know me, this is quintessential Hilaria. Welp! Let’s go with the flow!”*** Willful ignorance isn’t a cute flex and maybe she realized that because she added that when she was 4 and half months along, ***“I was having dinner with a friend, and every few minutes I would be in pain. He said, “I think you’re having contractions and need to call your doctor.” Alarmed, I did, and my doctor told me I was dehydrated from the plane ride and needed to drink Gatorade. I stupidly blurted out, “I am so sorry, but I don’t drink things that color.” He basically told me to get my butt to the bodega and pick some up. I drank it, it worked, and the pains subsided.”***  What this tells us is that she is capable of assessing her shortcomings (albeit only in retrospect). This could have been a different book altogether if she did more of this but, alas, she surrounds herself with yasss, girl types and we have this vegan sloppy joe of a “book.”
* Now we come to the most egregious part of this chapter. This nincompoop writes: ***“Closer to my due date, I began to genuinely wonder: How does one get a baby out? I hadn’t taken any birthing classes; I’d been too anxious to even read about it! To give myself comfort, I’d look around at every person I saw and would think: You were a baby, and you, and you. This must be possible, and I will find out when the time comes! These people around me had come out! It helped me remember that people have been having babies forever, and that I could do this. This might seem silly, but sometimes I function with childlike simplicity.”***
* Y’all. This is an insult to children everywhere. Hillary’s mother is a medical doctor. Hillary went to elite U.S. schools where she presumably took high school biology, although Massachusetts does not require sex ed in schools, so maybe we can place blame there.
* I read this part to Mr. Bat, who is Latin American (his parents didn’t just like the language), and he said esta vieja tiene un tornillo suelto/this broad has a screw loose.    
* She doubles down and says, ***“I didn’t know much about labor when I had my first child other than I was supposed to head to the hospital when my contractions were five minutes apart, lasted for sixty seconds, and “hurt like hell,” according to my ob-gyn.”***   Ok. She calls her mom after laboring for about 4 hours at home and Dr. Kathy instructed her to call the doctor. Was Alec walking the dogs at 3:30 a.m.? Why didn’t he call the doctor? I think it’s interesting Dr. Kathy wasn’t there, but also not everyone chooses to have their mom with them. She gives birth to Carmen and recalls ***“I couldn’t believe that I’d pushed her out, that she was here, that she had ten fingers and toes and a face and was a whole person.”*** Unoriginal in every way.
* She adds nothing to the parenting/self-help/fiction literary canons by musing ***“Through having babies, I have learned that society often connects motherhood to physical pain and suffering in a very specific way. While I have had six babies in a more traditional way, I have learned through my losses, my baby born via surrogate, and having a stepdaughter that paths may look different, but when our babies are here, we love them just the same. We have as strong a bond with each, and we are all very much worthy of the title “mother.”***  To punctuate this scintillating thought we get a full page of this picture shot by her reliably terrible photographer acquaintance:

[When terrible composition meets terrible parents of innocent kids. ](https://preview.redd.it/9b1ksq38kqcf1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b6787c4a4bdc7441286dd8387385e5e917682dd)

 **Pregnancy Loss**

* After kid number 4 things get murky in the timeline and in Hilz’s narrative. She says: ***“I’ve had a few chemical pregnancies over the years, mostly between my pregnancies with Carmen, Rafa, Leo, and Romeo, from the ages of twenty-nine to thirty-four.”***  A chemical pregnancy is a pregnancy loss that happens before the fifth week.
* She says she had Romeo at age 34 and was very put out that at age 35 she was classified a geriatric pregnancy or advanced maternal age: ***“It seemed ridiculous that just a year later I was considered “geriatric.”***” Hilz, poodle, that’s how boundaries are determined: there has to be a cutoff point to distinguish one phase from another. I swear, Dr. Kathy and Señor Dave need to demand their money back from the Cambridge School of Weston and from NYU.
* Well, ol’ Hilz decides that ***“thirty-five was also the age at which I was no longer willing to put up with all the secrecy and shenanigans of keeping my life hidden from the public. There was a market for information about me, often fabricated and untrue, and so the way I decided to deal with it was to get ahead of it by sharing my own news first. At the time, I felt like this was a win and a way to take hold of my power; now I think it was a trauma response to having my boundaries violated so many times, for so many years. I don’t fault myself, but I have learned to have the courage and confidence not to give myself away as I once did.”***  So bold and daring.
* Here’s the boundary violation story: ***“When I was pregnant with Carmen and just nearing twelve weeks, I went to New Orleans for the Super Bowl. (Alec was hosting the NFL Honors.) I was nauseous and tired, and a supposed friend told me I should go and get some sun—that vitamin D had helped his wife when she was pregnant. So I put on a bathing suit and lay by the pool. Little did I know, the person I considered a confidant had set me and my little baby bump up to be photographed, outing me and sharing my pregnancy news with the world before I had even let friends know.”*** I freely admit I don’t give Hilz much grace because she’s a lying liar who lies. If the above story is true, it stinks. My gut reaction, though, is that there’s only a small kernel of truth in there somewhere.
* Back to the fuzzy timeline: she speaks only in very general terms like ***“I found out I was pregnant again in the spring, but, from the beginning, the baby never had a strong heartbeat.”***
* Ok so the pregnancy wasn’t viable, and she decided to tell the world because she was tired of hiding her miscarriages. She describes it like this: ***“I decided to talk about this issue on the Today show before any other news outlet got the story. I hoped it would help other women experiencing the same thing and potentially open up space for those who might want to talk about their own losses. I discussed why we are expected to pretend to be strong and okay, when we are suffering… After I left the Today show studio, I went directly to my ultrasound. My baby’s heartbeat had fully stopped. I cried for myself and for this baby, even though I’d known it was inevitable.”*** Friends, she wasn’t giving birth in 1950. It was 20 fricking 18 – who was stigmatizing miscarriage?
* She conveniently skipped over the part where she partnered with Nivea in October of 2019 for their “Rethink Soft” campaign, which sought to *“challenge the perception that softness is synonymous with weakness.”* At the time she posted on her IG: ***“By choosing to be soft I became vulnerable, and through becoming vulnerable I found the truest strength. Not only within myself, but within our community. This image is one that I posted of me going into my d&c surgery this past spring. I’m excited to be partnering with*** u/niveausa ***for their #rethinksoft campaign to help others see the power in soft and how it can actually unite us all #ad #niveausa.'”***

[It takes nerves of steel and an ego the size of Mallorca to post pictures like this on social media. ](https://preview.redd.it/e16pf66jkqcf1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=7596fb4fb9b40a8de0ac60bf168712d41a13abd1)

*  Not a peep about [the Nivea connection](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/puu1tu/hilaria_baldwin_milking_her_two_miscarriages_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) in her “book,"" but, according to Hillary, ***“soon after this miscarriage, once my HCG numbers hit “not pregnant,” I decided to do in vitro fertilization for the first time.”***  
* This is [a great post tracking all the supposed pregnancies](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/o8gctc/timeline_of_lies_hillary_igd_telling_carmen_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button); but for our purposes here’s a mini timeline to cut through her vague bullshit:
   * May 2018 - Romeo born
   * January 2019 - Conceives naturally
   * April 2019 - Miscarriage #1 posted on IG
   * October 2019 - Nivea partnership referencing miscarriage #1
   * May-June 2019 – IVF process
   * July 2019 – conceives via IVF (the only specific date she gives is that this baby’s due date was April 30, 2020)
   * November 2019 - Miscarriage #2 announced via IG post with Carmen on IG
   * December 2019 - Gets pregnant “the old-fashioned way”
   * June 2020 - Surrogate implanted with Marilú when Hilz is supposedly 6 months pregnant with Edu
   * September 2020 - Alec tells Conan O’Brian IVF of baby lost Nov. 2019 was for gender selection
   * September 2020 - Edu born
   * February 2021 - Marilú born
   * September 2022 – Ilaria born
* So, what new info do we glean about her fertility journey?
   * ***“In so many ways, however, my IVF pregnancy felt different compared to my first four pregnancies. I felt off.”***
   * In a break with most OB/GYN office protocol, Doina, the ultrasound tech, told her the baby was deceased. Hilz described it thusly: ***“In a small, trembling voice I asked, “Is everything okay?” “No, it isn’t,” she responded. “Is she dead?” I asked. “Yes.” I looked at the screen and saw the lifeless baby just floating there. I began to sob.”***
   * Alec was on the Hamptons Jitney bus when he called and told him; I thought it was a city bus per other scrambled versions of this story Hilz had told.
   * Here is how she recounts her insane choice to record and post (!) herself breaking the news to Carmen: “***As soon as I got home, I told Carmen. “I know I told you that your little sister was coming, but I was wrong, and she will come another time.” I didn’t know what else to say. I recorded our conversation on video, because I wanted to include Alec as well as I could in this process. I shared the video on my Instagram. I couldn’t think of anything else to do. I just needed it to be out there; I couldn’t handle any more congratulations. Not one. I thought it would break me. Maybe this sounds strange, but I also just needed it to be real, since it felt like a nightmare. My daughter hugged me and kissed me and was way more composed and wiser than I was. I learn so much from my children who are truly wise beyond their years.”***
   * She took an Uber alone to the doctor’s office for the scheduled D&C because Alec was meeting her there – apparently her many, many friends were too busy to go with: ***“I was in an Uber, going uptown, and the driver was listening to the morning radio. The news came on, and at one point it said, “Some sad news: Alec and Hilaria Baldwin have had their second pregnancy loss in a row.” It felt like my breath had been taken away. I leaned forward toward the driver and in a low, shaky voice said, “They are talking about me. This is me and I am going to have the baby taken out of me now and that is where you are driving me to.” He didn’t respond. “Sir? Sir?” I was basically having an out-of-body experience. I thought to myself, What are you doing, Hilaria? Just stop talking and sharing! I leaned back, tearful, realized it was a blessing the man hadn’t heard me, and soldiered on.”***

***Surrogacy or “The Mean Boollies Say Marilú is Not Really My Baby”***

* Apparently, Hillary was aware of the idea of ***“vending machine babies”*** for celebrities who are ***“too vain or lazy to have their own kids”*** but scolds us for daring to believe this might be a true narrative. As she’s embarking on this part of her story, she includes this picture apropos of nothing:

 

[She’s not pregnant and is in the middle of her story about having Edu. Marilú, not Ilaria, is the surrogate baby. Just a mess.](https://preview.redd.it/ihc2wrzvkqcf1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=1efeb62a279585f7a2cb398548a737007fc668ee)

*  She seemed fixated on how bad her body felt with the IVF baby: ***“During my pregnancy with Edu, my body felt like it did with my earlier pregnancies—nothing like how it had reacted to the IVF pregnancy. I knew that I also wanted to use this other embryo I had. I was still hurting from our recent loss; I illogically blamed myself and I believed that my body had rejected IVF, and would do so again. I realize now how irrational this sounds, but back then that’s how I felt.”***  At least she references the additional embryo that would become Marilú but says nothing about why they rushed to implant the surrogate when Hilz herself was 6 months pregnant with Edu. So, no real substance, just yippity-yap about how lovely the surrogate was and how they would chat on the phone bc they were both pregnant at the same time, like it was just a crazy, happy coincidence. This nutter.
* Her very white, American, non-Spanish grandpa gets a shoutout: apparently he asked if Marilu was a *“three way baby”* (which fits in this chapter) and since she brought him up, Hilz  launches right into the story about him being a straight veteran who would fly the  LGBTQIA+ flag outside his home because ***“he wanted all to know that everyone was welcome and that “straight men didn’t have to be so insecure about their own sexuality.” Bless him.”***  Clearly this doesn’t fit in this chapter, but you know what? She could have thrown in a recipe for tofu paella and it would not matter – nothing makes sense: not the timeline, not the weird pictures, not the Queer ally grandpa story, nothing.

Since that ill-omened day when I rediscovered the book amidst the other volumes - that dark turning point marking the onset of my inexorable descent into a realm beyond human reason - weeks have passed whose torments have shackled both heart and mind.

In this time, I have endured things that a sober, clear-thinking mind would dismiss as the hallucinations of an overworked librarian - and surely, but for the few weeks since then, I myself would have done so, when this tale was nothing but a distant nightmare, one to be met with weary smiles or bitter laughter.

Yet now I write these words with trembling hand, driven by the uncanny fear that I am about to lose all footing on the thin boundary separating reality.

I seek no sympathy, nor belief. I know the horror that such words carry - how they sound, how they wound.

But perhaps, just perhaps, this will be read by one who has once glimpsed the unspeakable.

Perhaps such a being might explain what is happening to me - or perhaps this is but my last attempt to stave off madness.

On the day I found the book for a second time - a shadow lurking among the orderly returns, as though it belonged there - I returned it to the archive.

This time, however, with a desperate wish to seal it away, to consign it forever to darkness.

With trembling hands, I cleared space in one of the ancient, heavy archive boxes, removed yellowed files, faded folders, and musty catalogs, laid the book carefully at the very bottom, then piled the old contents back atop it.

I sealed the lid with multiple layers of tape, re-labeled the box, and placed it on the darkest, most remote shelf, buried deep behind forgotten folders untouched for years.

I tried to calm myself. I sought a rational explanation.

Perhaps it was a cruel prank by Lena, who had been here the night before. She had seen how the book disturbed me. Maybe she had sneaked back, pulled it from the archive, and slipped it among the returns - a vile joke meant to drive me mad.

That explanation suddenly seemed so plausible - yes, it had to be!

With this thought, I climbed back up the stairs repeating the story to myself until a sudden anger welled inside me - anger at Lena, for such cruelty.

But then, halfway up the stairs, a sudden shock gripped me, a jolt of cold terror:

Lena had no key.

She always came only in the afternoon, when the library was already open. And she was never alone in the evenings. She needed no key - she could not have entered the archive.

For a brief moment, relief flooded me - but the fragile peace was swiftly shattered.

For the more disturbing question now rose, unavoidable: If not Lena, then who?

I searched for answers in the realm of logic - Mrs. Brandt, perhaps? But she had long left in the evening, oblivious to the book. Practical, dry, precise - no type for such secret games.

My mind began to falter as cold dread knotted my stomach and a film of sweat glazed my brow.

I dragged myself to the reception, collapsed helplessly into my chair, bowed my head onto folded arms - just for a moment, I told myself. Just briefly close my eyes, gain a spark of distance, to find clarity.

Yet the sense that something primordial, something unspeakable, had crept into my life crept like a cold fog deeper into my soul - visible only to my spirit, invisible to the world.

For ten minutes, I sat motionless before slowly pulling myself together and trying to interpret everything rationally.

Perhaps I never actually returned the book to the archive yesterday? That had to be the case! For when I saw it lying among the stacks, the carefully placed note of mine was gone. And in the archive, I had not seen it anywhere.

The past days must have been more exhausting than I admitted to myself. The move, suppressed memories - all weighed heavier on my soul than I had realized.

This thought gave me a deceptive calm. I began scanning the books with sober mind - an ordinary morning in a seemingly ordinary world.

The creak of the heavy entrance doors announced Mrs. Brandt’s arrival before I saw her.

She stopped by the coffee machine, poured herself an espresso, and then came to me.

“Morning, Clara,” she said, taking off her jacket.

“Good morning, Mrs. Brandt,” I replied.

“Been here long?”

I nodded

She placed the scanned books on the cart.

“I had to drive a friend to work this morning, so I came in late,” she explained.

“No problem, Mrs. Brandt.” I replied

We stood silently side by side, each lost in our own world. I scanned, she sorted.

Suddenly she paused, looked at me with unexpected concern: “Are you alright, Clara? You look… tired. And somewhat ill.”

There was a genuine worry in her voice that surprised me.

“Yes, no, I’m fine,” I answered, trying to hide my fatigue.

The morning passed without incident.

In the afternoon, an event with a group of young students brought me new joy - their childlike wonder a bright light.

Locking the library in the evening was routine, uneventful.

On the way home, I almost forgot the dark burden of the book -overshadowed by the banal reality of the day.

But upon entering my apartment, the inconceivable struck me: The same black book lay on my coffee table.

My heart pounded wildly.

How had it come here? Who had brought it?

I approached the couch and picked it up.

I fixed my gaze on the book, its warm, almost living leather feeling in my hand like the beating heart of a foreign monster.

A metallic scent stung my nose again, sharper than before. A faint humming, barely more than a whisper, seemed to emanate from the book.

Cautiously, I opened it.

There was Sarah again - her fate recorded in faded script, captured within a story.

A feeling of being watched crept up my spine like a dark serpent.

Suddenly, a dark suspicion struck me: Someone had to be in my apartment.

I hastily set the book aside, grabbed a knife - my last shield against a danger I could neither see nor grasp.

With heart racing, I searched the small, shadow-filled apartment.

Every corner seemed to swallow me, every darkness seemed to move.

I rummaged through cupboards, looked under the bed, behind the shower curtain — anywhere a being might hide.

But no one was there.

The thought of calling the police arose - but I felt it would be futile.

Then the shattering realization struck like a dagger in my heart: No one had brought the book here.

I cannot explain it - and my mind still wrestles with this - but I felt like I had to return to the couch, take the book again, and sit down.

Slowly, I opened the last page and began to read.

The words described with oppressive precision how Sarah sat in her car, on the way home - a scene so vivid it seared itself into my consciousness like a nightmare.

I read the page to its end, ready to close the book.

But then the unfathomable happened: On the next page, previously blank, new words formed, as if the story itself was growing - like a living, malevolent entity.

With mounting disbelief, I stared at the book, unable to comprehend what I saw.

This could not be.

Yet, inexorably, I read on as Sarah’s journey home unfolded before my eyes - written by a hand that could not be human.

I know not how long I sat there, enthralled by the cursed book, which opened before me like a gate into a foreign reality not meant for mortal eyes. Perhaps three hours. Perhaps more. Time had lost all meaning in that state.

I read.

The pages portrayed with absurd, tormenting detail how Sarah came home, carelessly slipped off her shoes, greeted her cat with a soft murmur, prepared a simple meal, and finally settled on her couch, staring into the dim flicker of a poorly tuned television.

I read of the shower, of light flowing over her shoulders like water, and of the silence of her bedroom as she finally lay down to fall into a dreamless sleep.

 

But I did not merely read.

I was her.

I smelled the dust in her apartment, felt the weight of her cat on my lap, sensed the hot water on my - no, her - skin, and heard the muffled sounds of night through her tilted window.

It was no longer mere reading.

It was a transmission.

An invasion.

A substitution.

Only when she fell asleep could I lay the book aside.

I was exhausted, more than after a day of hard labor, exhausted in a way that can only be described as a draining of the spirit.

I sat motionless, staring at the wall, empty, numb.

Then came the horror.

I, Clara - a rational woman, enlightened and sober - sat with a book that wrote itself, while simultaneously invading the life of a stranger like a ghost unsure whether it was observer or possessed.

The thought was unbearable, precisely because it was so clear.

I knew no one would believe me. Not the police, not my friends, not even myself - if it had happened to another.

I would have laughed at such a tale. But now?

Now I laugh no more.

A sudden thought pierced me like cold electricity: Was Sarah even real? Or was she an illusion of the book, a phantom shaped from alien thoughts, born from nothing?

I had to know.

I knew her full name - the text had named her repeatedly.

I took my phone, hands trembling. The light of the screen hurt my eyes.

I typed her name.

And then… there she was.

An Instagram profile. Public. Unremarkable. A selfie on a balcony. A blurred coastline in the background.

I had never seen that face before. And yet I knew - with a certainty that chilled my blood - that it was hers.

Sarah.

My temples began to throb.

A cruel pain shot through my head, as if something inside me was bursting.

I dropped the phone, staggered to the kitchen, somehow found an aspirin.

But it did no good.

The fatigue did not come as ordinary exhaustion.

It was like a dense fog, heavy, oppressive, blacker than sleep.

I collapsed back onto the couch, and the world sank into a dull, swampy darkness.

And that night, I dreamed for the first time of the archive.

Not our archive.

Another.

Older.

Deeper.

I know not when exactly the dream began - or whether it was a dream at all.

Perhaps it was more a passage, a slipping across, a threshold I crossed when my body sank into sleep on the couch.

I found myself in the midst of a room.

An archive.

But not the semi-modernized archive of my library - no, this one was old. Ancient.

The air was heavy, nearly damp, filled with the acrid scent of dust, leather, and something else I could not name - something like old flesh or deeply buried earth.

The only light came from scattered oil lamps, their flickering glow hanging in murky panes like a tired sun over a dying land.

Shadows crept across the floor, trembling against the walls as if alive.

The walls - if they could be called walls - consisted of endless bookshelves. Massive, worm-eaten wood, unevenly built, twisting like in a nightmare where geometry obeys no rule.

None of the shelves were empty.

They were crammed with books, all alike.

Black leather.

No title. No author.

No hint of content or origin.

I knew without thought, without doubt, that they were the same books as the one I had at home. Only with different content.

They looked like clones.

Embryonic births of an alien consciousness.

I wanted to speak.

To utter a sound.

A call, a word.

But no sound came from my mouth. Only my breath, heavy and shallow.

I looked around.

There was no door.

No windows.

No obvious way out.

Only shelf after shelf, book after book.

No end.

A labyrinth of knowledge no man should ever grasp.

And then - the whispering.

Not loud. No.

Far too soft to comprehend. But omnipresent.

Like a hundred voices crawling through the cracks of the shelves, like breaths between the pages.

They spoke no language I knew. Or perhaps they spoke every language at once.

A whisper of things that existed before time itself.

I shivered.

Not from cold, but from a knowledge lurking behind the whisper.

A feeling that I was seen.

Not watched in the ordinary sense - but penetrated, as if my mind were an open book and something between the shelves was flipping its pages.

I wanted to flee.

But my legs refused to obey.

It was as if the room itself held me - not physically, but like a web spun from meaning, expectation, unavoidable fate.

And then something happened - not seen, but felt:

A movement.

A shadow, not a light interrupted - but darkness intensifying.

Something was there.

Not near. Not yet. But approaching.

My heart raced. I gasped for air.

Panic coursed through me like cold fire.

I wanted to wake. I wanted to scream.

But I was trapped - in the room, in time, in knowledge.

I knew that if I touched even one of those books, I would never wake again.

Never return.

For this was no mere archive.

It was a consciousness.

A place where thoughts were bound. Where souls lay trapped between pages.

And I was but a breath away from becoming the next.

I awoke with a start, as if an invisible hand had torn me from the depths of my consciousness.

My heart hammered wildly against my ribs.

The room was silent, and the dim daylight filtering through the curtains seemed to struggle to pierce a leaden darkness I still felt within my mind.

For a moment, I was paralyzed, caught between dream and reality, my senses reeling, and a nameless dread settled like a heavy veil over my thoughts.

Then my eyes fell upon the coffee table.

There it lay.

The book.

Motionless, as if an ancient being patiently awaited my turning of the next page.

The cover seemed alive in the gloom, pulsating like the skin of a foreign monster.

And as I placed my trembling hands upon the table, I knew the night had shown me more than the limits of reason would allow.

The memories of that endless room, the oil lamps, the dusty shelves, the whispering murmurs - they burned themselves into my soul as if clawed by an invisible talon.

I wanted to rise, to seek the outside world, to force normality - but my limbs were heavy, and the weight of that knowledge pressed upon me like an unseen stone.

My fingers sought my phone.

I sent a message to Mrs. Brandt, my own voice in the text as faint and distant as my spirit: “Mrs. Brandt, I will take the day off today. I do not feel well. — Clara”

The book lay there. Still. Patient.

And I was trapped in its thrall.

I forced myself to rise, shaking off the heavy shadows that clung to me from the night before.

The day was to be calm, I resolved - a day free of toil and obligation, a day of silence and order.

I began with a simple meal, prepared with mechanical motions. The clink of cutlery, the faint sizzle in the pan-small, mundane sounds that briefly tore me from the dark fog that had settled in my mind.

Afterward, I sat before the television and put on an old film, one whose plot I vaguely remembered. The voices and images momentarily captured my thoughts, yet my gaze kept drifting back to that black book on the coffee table.

There it lay, immovable, as if fused to the apartment itself, a living thing, patiently awaiting its hour.

To distract myself, I reached for another book - an innocent novel, far removed from secrets or dark powers. Yet even as I read, a persistent unrest gnawed at me, stirred by the black tome. A tug, a relentless yearning pulling me back again and again.

The harder I tried to resist, the clearer it became - I could not escape it.

At last, as the sun passed its zenith and shadows shortened, I yielded.

With trembling fingers, I lifted the book from the table, opening its heavy cover - felling strangely alive beneath my touch.

The words unleashed themselves like a frigid wind, sweeping through my consciousness.

Sarah sat at her desk, surrounded by the pale glow of flickering neon lights that bathed the room in cold, sterile illumination.

Her hands flew over the keyboard, but she seemed nervous, restless, as if sensing invisible eyes watching her every move.

“Sarah felt watched,” I read - the words simple, yet loaded with a suffocating dread that pierced my very soul.

Her gaze flicked repeatedly toward the door - her shoulders tensed as if bracing for an inevitable assault.

Sarah did not linger long at her desk, the oppressive presence in the air unbearable.

She rose, nervously brushed hair from her face, and moved to the window, staring out at the gray facades of surrounding buildings. The light outside was dull, filtered through a heavy, leaden sky.

A chill filled the room, making Sarah’s skin prickle as if unseen cold seeped outward from within.

She forced herself back to the desk, resuming work on the documents before her.

Again and again she glanced over her shoulder, as if trying to glimpse someone who was not there.

The feeling of being watched clung to her - her heart beat unevenly, her thoughts spun in chaos.

Yet no one was there - only shadows that seemed to move when unobserved.

During her lunch break, she left the office for a small café around the corner and ordered coffee.

Seated at a window table, she tried to focus on the outside scene, but the sensation persisted: Someone - or something - followed her, listening to every word, stalking her steps.

She ate mechanically, appetite absent, often gazing out as sluggish gray clouds lumbered like ancient titans over the city.

Hurriedly, she swallowed the last sip of her cold coffee as the clock announced the end of her break.

She forced herself to rise, stiff limbs reluctant but moving, leaving the café with heavy footsteps.

The clouds now seemed to press even closer, intent on smothering every spark of life.

Back at the office, she sat once more at her desk. Documents awaited her, and though her mind battled the oppressive presence, she worked as if nothing were amiss.

Her fingers danced over the keyboard, but each time she looked up, she flinched - as though a shadow moved at the edge of her vision.

The hours dragged on endlessly. The whispering - silent to all but her - was a constant companion.

No attack came, no tangible threat - only the paralyzing sense that something unspeakable drew near, encircling her.

When the workday ended, Sarah hastily gathered her things. She wanted to reach the safety of her own home as swiftly as possible.

Once inside, she followed her usual routine.

She cooked a simple meal, stroked her cat, which purred softly at her feet, sat on the couch, and turned on the television.

The flickering images offered faint comfort, though her eyes were weary, her mind restless.

After dinner, she took a warm shower, the water seeming to wash the cold shiver from her skin - yet the feeling of being watched endured.

Finally, she lay down, pulling the blanket up to her chin and closing her eyes.

But sleep was no gentle refuge. Within her, a dark dream began to stir.

Just as Sarah’s eyes closed and she sank into the shadowed depths of that dream, I snapped from my trance.

Dazed, I looked about.

The room was draped in the dusky darkness of evening, only the faint glow of streetlights filtering through the windows.

A suffocating stillness hung over the apartment, as though time itself held its breath.

Slowly, I realized I had done nothing else all day but read the book - lost within that alien, disturbing world unfolding relentlessly before me.

I rose, limbs heavy as if shackled by invisible chains.

The apartment felt suddenly empty, colder than before, though nothing seems to have changed.

I went to the kitchen, brewed a cup of herbal tea, took the steaming mug in both hands, and sat in the old armchair by the window.

Outside, the wind whispered softly through the trees, and the muted light of night seemed to lull me.

Despite my exhaustion, I did not wish to sleep just yet.

I stared into the dark cup, struggling to order my thoughts, but the images from the book would not let me be.

Something inside me yearned to regain control - yet the book pulled me back with an inexplicable force.

At last, I set the cup aside, turned off the light, took a shower, and crawled into bed.

The blanket felt heavy upon my shoulders - like the shadows I could not shake.

As I stared into the darkness, sleep slowly enveloped me - but deep within, I knew Sarah’s story and that of this book had only just begun.

I dreamed again the same dream as the night before.

Again, I found myself in that gloomy chamber, its walls lined with endless wooden shelves that stretched silently to an unseen ceiling.

The pale light of old oil lamps cast flickering shadows on the black, leather-bound books resting there - silent, yet brimming with unspeakable secrets.

I looked around, desperate to find an exit, a glimmer of hope - but the shelves seemed to shift, their rows endless, intent on imprisoning me.

A cold breath slipped through the room, and I heard indistinct whispers echoing between the volumes - like an ancient, lost song that gripped my thoughts.

I felt watched, surrounded by something beyond comprehension, something fixing countless eyes upon me though I saw nothing.

A nameless terror crept up my spine, making my limbs tremble.

Yet despite the fear, despite the panic, there was an inexplicable longing that drew me ever deeper into this labyrinth - as if I were not merely a prisoner, but a part of it.

I awoke again with a pounding heart, still dazed and caught between dream and waking.

The book lay beside me, pages spread open as if it had found its own way to me, beckoning me deeper into its baleful thrall.

Unthinkingly, I grasped the book once more and began to read.

A chill ran through me as I saw what was written - something that chilled my blood to ice.

Sarah had dreamed the same nightmare that night.

Deeply disturbed, Sarah reached for a sedative pill, its bitter taste biting her trembling tongue.

The words described how she sensed something was wrong - that the dream was no mere dream, but more like a teleportation to that accursed place.

She struggled desperately to shake the shadow, to organize her life, to begin the day as usual.

Yet a dark premonition slithered like a cold serpent through her thoughts: something dreadful was coming.

In the weeks that followed, I witnessed a womens descend into madness.

That day, I returned to work, determined to maintain normalcy.

But despite my efforts, a leaden weight pressed upon my shoulders.

Unconsciously, I had brought the book with me, hidden deep in my bag.

Again and again, in quiet moments among the shelves and the library’s hushed bustle, I caught my gaze drifting to the black spine, my fingers reaching for the book to read.

Sarah’s condition in the story deteriorated visibly.

She felt ever more pursued, pressed by an invisible presence poisoning her thoughts and entangling her in a web of paranoia and fear.

In my own life, the same oppressive dread spread - a difficult ache in my chest stealing my breath.

I knew instinctively I was the origin of all this - the origin of her paranoia, her fear, her inexorable decay - yet powerless to resist.

I could not set the book aside, could tell no one, and the thought of seeking escape seemed like fleeing an unavoidable truth.

Days passed, each melting into the next in a grim loop.

Again and again, I grasped the book, sinking deeper into Sarah’s world - a realm of terror and growing madness.

Sarah herself began neglecting her work, often sitting still and silent before her computer, glancing anxiously around.

Colleagues noticed the change.

They cautiously asked if she was well, but Sarah gave no answer, no explanation for the darkening cloud that cloaked her.

Her smile grew rare, her eyes dull.

Every encounter exhausted her, and fleeting glances betrayed a fear beyond words.

Then there were the nights - the nights that Sarah and me shared.

Every evening, I fell into the same dream, the same dark chamber of the archive.

Sarah entered that dream too, as lost and desperate as I. We shared this place, this mute, oppressive presence that enveloped us and slowly dissolved the boundary between reality and madness.

Our souls were entwined by the book, and with every page I read, Sarah’s decline seemed more inevitable - as if the book itself dragged us both down a spiral of despair and lunacy from which there was no escape.

Between the bleak nights, from time to time, another dream crept into my mind - a dream leading me to a pitch-black room, an endless void where all light was extinguished.

There, before me, lay Sarah - curled and crushed beneath a weight of despair, crying silently, endlessly.

I could do nothing but watch in mute helplessness, trapped as a silent observer.

And whenever I awoke from this vision and reached for the book, it was as though the dark scene reflected in Sarah’s dream.

She had the same dream, witnessed the same torment - only from a different angle.

While I looked down upon her, she lay upon the floor, watched by an overwhelming presence from which she could not flee.

But she could not see me.

With each passing day, Sarah’s decay became more apparent.

The light of her life faded in faint, faltering whispers.

She began avoiding work.

The routines that once carried her through the day crumbled to dust beneath her fear.

Colleagues noted her absence, but she remained silent. Messages went unanswered, calls ignored.

Even eating, once a simple necessity, became a burden.

Her fridge remained unopened, meals untouched.

The cat, once her loyal companion, was forgotten - left unfed and silent witness to her decline.

Sarah spent most days in bed, wrapped in a blanket as heavy as her thoughts.

Her eyes stared blankly at the ceiling as her mind wandered a dark labyrinth of fear and paranoia.

Every movement was effort, every breath a struggle.

A struggle she eventually lost.

That day I had just come home from work.

For some time, I had ceased having dinner - my appetite waned, along with all else within me.

I sank heavily onto the couch and resumed reading.

Before me unfolded the final moments of Sarah’s life.

She stood upon a rooftop, high above the flickering city lights that spread like tiny, cold stars in the darkness.

Tears ran down her face as memories of a former life overwhelmed her - friends, family, the women she once was slowy fading into the husk she was now.

Her weeping was quiet, almost resigned.

Then she leapt.

Her body plunged through the cold night air, her last thoughts inevitably drawn to the archive.

She knew - or believed - that she was becoming part of that dark abyss whose shadows had long loomed over her.

The impact came - a dull, final end.

I felt the familiar warmth of the book slip away, the metallic scent fading into nothingness, as if all life had been drained from its pages.

And before my eyes, the last words of her story emerged slowly, like a creeping mist:

I (F28) have been dating an INFJ (M39) since early March, and things have gotten pretty serious between us. Our relationship was largely emotional at first, just talking and coffee dates. He didn’t even kiss me until June, lol.

I guess my thing is, I struggle so much with commitment. Something that scares me is that I have a history of serious relationships. One lasted 7 ½ years, another a year and a half. I don’t want to get into another relationship unless I know that it’s truly right. I’m tired of investing in someone only to end up heartbroken again. I know it's not entirely rational to expect no heartbreak, but these feelings are real.

While we were kissing, he looked at me and told me he thinks he loves me, and that he wasn’t sure he’d ever feel that way again. He said his heart had been closed off and he was pretty cynical before me, but that he truly loves me and could imagine a life with me. I feel the same way about him.

My concerns are more practical. One of the biggest is the age gap. I know I should’ve thought about that more seriously before we started dating, but I originally had more of a “let’s see” mindset and didn’t expect it to get so serious. When I floated the idea of dating someone a decade older to my mom, she had a huge issue with it. We haven’t always had the best relationship, though it’s better now. The idea of having to constantly defend my decisions to others doesn’t sound appealing.

Another (smaller) issue is our lifestyle differences. He follows a strict carnivore diet, and while I eat a lot of meat, I don’t follow that. It makes it hard to do things I enjoy, like trying new foods together. He’s also really into blue light therapy, grounding, carnivore, and other niche health things, which I don't necessarily follow and wants to incorporate them into his future children’s lives. Not a dealbreaker, but something I’ve been thinking about.

That said, there’s so much I love about him. He truly loves, respects, and appreciates who I am. He’s never pressured me sexually and constantly verbally validates me. He makes me feel like the most beautiful and special person. In many ways, I feel so lucky to have found someone like him. He’s such a giving, kind, beautiful soul. Not to mention our chemistry is just top notch, crazy.

When he asked me to be his girlfriend last night, I said yes… then immediately said I wasn’t sure if we were rushing it. He was incredibly kind and understanding, saying he completely gets it and doesn’t mind waiting.

Another thing, and this isn’t about him, but last December I was SA'd by someone I had gone on dates with. It’s made it extremely hard for me to even think about having sex. He’s been so understanding about it. He said even if we’re in a relationship, we don’t have to have sex fast, that it’s entirely up to me and what I feel comfortable with and he would leave the pacing up to me.

I don’t know what’s holding me back in general. I don’t know if I’m self-sabotaging or if these are all genuine concerns. I feel strongly about him and could imagine a life with him… but I don’t know if I should be seriously weighing the practical concerns, or if love is enough.

**TLDR:** I (F28) really care for my partner (M39), who’s been kind and emotionally supportive, especially as I heal from past trauma. But I’m hesitating to fully commit due to the age gap, lifestyle differences, and fear of repeating past heartbreak. Unsure if I’m protecting myself or self-sabotaging.",2,1752454490.0,ENFP,1,1.0,False

I got an internship here because I needed some experience, and they were awfully willing to hire. In my interview, they asked questions about things like college degrees and other details they would know if they had read my resume. But they also asked odd questions like my mental fortitude, trauma, or brain injuries, specifically in the amygdala. I had not had any injuries or problems with trauma, I lived a pretty cushy life, after about 2 weeks since I was accepted as a data analyst for an artificial intelligence they were trying to develop. My job involved reviewing videos and stories under 5 minutes or 500 words. I've discovered a range of content on unsavory websites, as well as a lot of mild and plain awful things on every website you could think of.



It started to weigh on me after a while. I was supposed to read everything in detail to look for inappropriate materials, spelling mistakes, and grammatical errors.



For the first week and a half, I tried my best and didn't make any mistakes, but then my dog died, I had it through college, and it helped me stay sane after all the horrible things I had to look at in detail. That day, I still had to come into work and couldn't focus well at all. I skimmed a story about something or other, which I barely remember, but I just said it was okay to feed to the AI. About thirty seconds after I had approved the store, I heard a bellowing, inhuman howl originate from the room below me. I jumped up out of my cubicle and saw another new hire cover his head in fear. The whole building shook, I thought it was an earthquake, but we don't live on a fault line. I asked the worker next to me what had happened. He told me that the building had an old boiler that was being replaced, and whenever anybody used too much hot water, it would need to start up and shake the whole building. I didn't buy it.







For the next day I focused on gathering details about the company, I spent my break sitting in the breakroom, the wall in the east side was thin enough to hear through and on the other side was a meeting room for the managers working on the AI project, During my break I sat at the table next to the wall. I leaned my ear against it while drinking my coffee. I heard some unintelligible murmur, something about ""Data collection"", ""Intake Increase"", and most alarmingly, ""Revelation increase"". Although the majority of it was just begging for an investor for a large sum of money, the meeting mentioned a ""revelation chamber"" and a showcase of this technology. I was highly invested in the meeting that I overlooked one of my coworkers sitting across from me. I eventually snapped out of it and went to face him, and I realized it was the intern from earlier. We exchanged some greetings and shared each other's names, He then asked ""I don't think that the earthquake from earlier was just a boiler, do you know what it might be?"" He sounded worried and spoke in a hushed tone, I responded with ""I don't know I'm just as new as you, but I think that it might just be a boiler."" I couldn't trust him so I didn't reveal any suspicions I had.







I left the breakroom and continued as usual throughout my day, I was looking for any specific details I saw a security guard use a security dongle to open an elevator when about an hour and a half after I left the breakroom the PA system crackled to life and requested me to enter the downstairs server office. I walked down the hall to a door that led to a staircase. The upper floors were blocked off, and the only floor I could go to was one story in the basement. The stairs led deeper, but were blocked off by concrete. I entered the room and was instantly hit by a blast of heat. This was the server room. I walked through and saw hundreds of server racks. I walked across the room and noticed a few odd details. There was a bottle, but it looked relatively modern, like it was from the early 2000s, hardly old enough to cause such a racket. I walked into the office about 20 feet from the boiler. The door was made of thick steel, probably to keep the awful heat from the servers out. I reached out my hand and opened the door.







I felt a cold rush of air as I stepped into the room and saw someone hunched at an old desk piled high with old papers, oddly, no computer. The man asked me to sit down and introduced himself as my manager., I hadn't met him during the interview process, so I only spoke to my supervisor. He informed me that they had discovered that I had made a catastrophic error and that the story I had submitted the day before was bad enough that it set back the AI's development by a week and that as punishment, I would not be receiving any extra benefits or holiday breaks or bonuses for the rest of the year. ""But it's March!"" I protested but he shut me down and said that I should remain focused on my job ""For you to maintain peak synergy with your coworkers you will need to focus on-"" I stopped listening because something strange was happening I suddenly had an inspiration, the key the guard used had a radio signal transmitter inside the receiver that was used to unlock the key card. If I used a signal cloner, then I could walk past the security guard and clone the signal on his tag.







""...I hope you listened to my advice, and please do well at your new position. Also, help out the new intern with efficiency training."" I had zoned out entirely, yet it was as if it wasn't me thinking these things. ""New position? I'm sorry, can you please review me on my duty?"" He looked disappointed and informed me that I would be assigned to data analysis of books and would need to get at least 2 books done in one workday to keep my optimal pay of 21 dollars an hour. I left his office and walked back upstairs., I hated books, at least with the last position, I could just watch videos at five times speed, or read a very short story, or a bad take on Facebook. But now I needed to read whole books for the same pay.







After about 2 hours of reading a book about a bunch of fish people, I clocked out of work and went home to find a signal cloner online. After about 4 minutes of looking, I found one used to steal Kia's and to clone keycards. After I ordered it, I realized it would take 2 days for it to be delivered to me. But that night, I had a dream about something under the building. I don't remember much about the first dream, but for all the other dreams, I kept a dream journal to catalogue them.







The next day, I focused my goal on memorizing all of the camera's positions., One was located in the main office room near the entrance, and another was located in the hallway leading to the manager's offices and the staircase. The building was not built like an office buildin;, it had a large central room connected to the entrance where we all worke,d and a large hallway lined with individual offices and storage room,s along with other random rooms in that hallway was an elevator and the staircase at the end of that hallway. The building had only two stories, with some assumed to be executive offices, and the floor I worked on was the manager and worker floor. There were in total 4 cameras on the first floor: 1 in the main office, 2 in the hallway, and 1 in the breakroom. I clocked out and had the idea that the internet could have some information about this place.







I looked up the building and found some information on the current building, but it was nothing I didn't know from working there. But I did learn that the local library had some newspapers in the building and a building layout. I drove to the library, but they closed at 7, and I got there at 6:35. Since it was a Friday, I knew they would be closed for the next two days. If I didn't get what I needed right, I would be in the dark for 2 days. I ran in and found the computer that had copies of every newspaper released in the town, along with legal documents and blueprints for the majority of buildings. I looked up the address and obtained the building plans, but they didn't match the one I worked in. The office was labeled as a hotel with the main reception area and 24 rooms. There were two 2 basements, one much deeper than the other. The first basement was labeled as a wine cellar. The second basement, which was sixty feet deeper than the first basement, was labeled as a fallout shelter added for the staff and occupants in the event of a nuclear disaster.







The shelter was built in the 1950s, but the elevator shaft and stairwell leading down had been there since the original building was constructed in the 1930s. The company purchased and renovated the current office in 2014. They sealed off the stairwell leading to the fallout shelter but retained the elevator shaft, which led to the shelter. Additionally, they improved the shelter by adding three more rooms. Initially, the shelter had a central communal room, an extensive library and printing press room, and a barracks on the other side. But the company added 12 new rooms over the year, including a few offices and a server room in the bunker, along with an emergency generator.







I kept looking for more information when I felt a bone-cold hand wrap around my shoulder., I flipped around and saw the old librarian. ""Sir, it's twenty minutes past closing time. Can you please leave the library?"" I had to leave the library, so I went back home and put a notebook next to my bed to catalogue a potential dream., I had one last night, so I assumed I would have one tonight as well.







I wrote this in my dream journal that night. ""I saw the spirit, and the angels around it. I wanted to dance with the man, but I couldn't move. I had to learn with them. I had to be one with them. I just wanted to talk to them. They spoke back. ""On the page was a drawing of a man drawn only from the waist up.



I opened my door to leave for work on a Saturday when I saw a package on my apartment floor. I was excited that my signal cloner had come a day early, but when I opened it, I realized it was just a letter in a box instead of an envelope. The letter read, ""They read the letters, meet me at (address) tomorrow, and bring the journal."" I assumed the journal he mentioned was my dream journal, since I had only one entry, and I couldn't imagine how he knew about it. Letters take time to deliver. Did whoever this person was learn about the journal before I did?







Work was tedious for the first 6 hours. I reviewed a story about a bear man and another Mormon apologist's book. Then I heard a horrible crash, even worse than the one a few days ago. The whole building shook, and the power went out for a few seconds.  Ceiling tiles fell off the ceiling, and the cameras turned off for about 5 minutes due to the power outage. People were running out of the building. I nearly jumped out the window. A loud, earsplitting scream shattered the glass. The PA system turned on and said, ""All employees. IT IS FINE. The disaster is CONTAINED. Due to damages, you will have the rest of the day off."" 







I saw the other intern visibly shaking; he looked awful. ""Efficiency training"" hit him hard. What had happened? I have done everything.. I read 2 books today and labeled both as fiction.  I then received a notification on my phone, prompting me to check my account. The email stated that all religious categories are categorized in a separate folder, which only exacerbates the issue for the micro earthquake affecting all 12 data analysts. Eight of them incorrectly categorized it as fiction, while three senior employees placed it in the correct tab. As a result, these employees would not face a pay cut. One employee incorrectly categorized it as non-fiction. I was not excited to have to work double time for half the pay.







I began to drive home, but I saw something trailing behind me. I saw a car that I usually don't see on my commute home, it was black with tinted windows and followed about 150 feet behind my car. I turned away from my house and started to drive through the town in random directions, and the car kept following me. I eventually made it onto the surprisingly empty highway. The city was tiny, with only a few hundred residents. Still, the highway usually had 1 or 2 cars, but this was utterly empty. I saw the car switch into the lane next to me and speed up just behind my back tire.







The car turned outward away from my car before trying to slam into my car's back tire at full speed, but I reacted quickly and slammed on the brakes. The car tried to stop, but it drifted onto its side and flipped over. I sat in my car in shock, gawking at the wreck. That was until I saw a hand and then a person crawl out of the window. I was just about to get out of my car to help him when he stood up, pulled a pistol, and started shooting at my car. I didn't have time to even think, I just slammed on my gas and ducked under my dashboard. The car lurched and then sped forward, and I hit the assailant, squashing his lower body between the wreck and my car. After a few seconds, I lifted my head up and saw the grizzly scene. The man has his entire lower half reduced to paste between the 2 cars, blood coated my whole hood.







I stepped out of the car, took the gun from the body, which had 10 bullets in the magazine, backed up a few feet, and opened my trunk. I dragged the half body to it and stuffed as much flesh and organs as possible, spilling from the exposed lower half. I used a rag to clean as much blood as possible from the hood and the front of the car. I couldn't do anything about my shattered windshield, but I did clean the broken glass from the inside of my vehicle. I then reversed and started to drive home.







After about 6 minutes of driving, I heard sirens. After looking through my rearview mirror, I saw a police car signalling for me to pull over. I complied and went off to the side of the road and rolled down my window.



""Y-Yes, officer?""  My voice was shaking. He replied, ""Do you know why I pulled you over today? I responded with ""No, sir, I do not."" My heart was pounding in my chest. ""Your windshield is broken. Mind explaining that to me?"" ""I was going to the city... And then I... Got caught in a drive-by shooting. I have bullet marks on my car."" The cop took a look at my car and said, ""I will give you a pass this time, but please fix your car. There is an auto shop 2 miles down from here.""



As I rolled up my window and saw the cop walk back to his car, I let out a sigh of relief and drove the rest of the way home. I was not going to take my chances with the auto mechanic with a body in the trunk. I deposited the stolen pistol under my pillow and drove out to the forest with a shovel. When I opened the trunk, I saw the body. It was covered in its own blood and viscera. 







After a few hours, the body was buried, and the trunk was cleaned of the blood staining the felt walls. It was only 6:30, so I still had time to go to the auto shop. It cost me $ 750 to repair my car, which took about 2 hours. I was exhausted today. I killed a man. He was trying to kill me, but I couldn't sleep at all that night.







The next day, I had to go to work. But that day, before I was planning on seeing the person who sent me that letter, so much happened that I missed the meetup. It was probably a trap; people were hunting me now, and I needed protection. The Pistol I had stolen wouldn't be enough. I took it anyway and put it in my pocket. I opened the door, ready to go, when I saw the signal cloner box sitting on my doormat. I opened it and tried to turn it on, but it didn't have any batteries and could only be charged by USB-C. I knew I couldn't charge it on my commute, so I would charge it in the office and use it on my way out.







As I turned into the building, I noticed a lot of cars and contractors working outside, trying to fix the building. I had to park next to an alley at the far end of the parking lot to enter. As I entered, I saw the intern, his skin was pale, and he was twitching constantly as he entered the building. He was breathing heavily and stumbling into his desk. I was so tired, I barely even noticed. The workers had already repaired the majority of the windows and some of the cameras. The manager was outside the basement and was helping the employees. This was the first time I had seen him outside of the server rooms.







The intern was shaking at his desk when he called out, ""Ma.. Manager, the Com... Computer is broken."" His voice was weak and gravely. The manager walked over to him and said, ""The computer's fine, what are you talking about?"" Then I heard an earsplitting scream. I flipped 180 degrees and saw the intern had pulled a knife and started stabbing the manager. The security guard ran over to the manager and screamed at the intern, ""DROP THE KNIFE, DROP THE KNIFE."" The intern ran at the security guard, and so he pulled out his gun and shot him 3 times. The shots rang out, and everybody panicked. Contractors jumped off their ladders, and people ran through the central cubicle hallway. I jumped at the opportunity, unplugged my signal cloner, and it was at 13%. Just enough to scan one signal, I turned it on and ran into the security guard. As I hit his dongle to my cloner, I heard three beeps, so I knew it was cloned.







I ran out of the building with everybody else. It was too hot to go into the elevator, so I started walking back to my car. When I turned to open the door, though, a bag went over my face. This was how I thought I was going to die, so close to uncovering the truth. After about a minute, the bag was ripped off my head. I looked around and I was in the back of a van with 2 armed people. ""TELL US WHO YOU WORK FOR!"" One of them shouted, and I covered my face with my hands, realizing they had not bound me. I told them my employers do not want to die today. They looked at each other for a second, and one of them asked, ""WHY DID YOU NOT SHOW UP?"" I was confused for a second before realizing I had missed the date on the letter







""I was almost killed! This car tried to run me off the road!"" I was so scared, I just screamed it out. They looked worried for a moment but gave me a demand, ""Tomorrow you will go to your job and compromise the security, then you WILL open the elevator door. If you don't, we are going to kill everyone in that office building."" I nodded my head, and they stopped and opened the door to my apartment building. ""Don't try hiding at home.""







I stumbled inside, shaken up. I had a long day that day. I was so tired that I didn't even think about what happened. I just plugged in the signal cloner and went to sleep. I didn't even charge my phone or take the gun out of my pocket.







I awoke to instructions in my dream journal on how to make a bag capable of blocking detection from metal detectors with materials I had in my house. Then I checked my phone, it was low battery, and there was an email, which read, ""Due to recent events, security has been increased at the first level. All employees are recommended to not bring metal objects or weapons into the workplace from here on out."" I realized that the bag I wrote down would be helpful to bring my signal cloner and pistol into the building.







After manufacturing the bag, I drove to work, and at the parking lot, I saw a person who ran up to my car and told me that ""3 O'clock be ready"". I walked in with the bag inside my pants. I saw 3 security guards, all armed with assault rifles. They instructed me to walk through the scanner, and I held my breath. But I've passed through it; now I just need to last until 3, and I won't work here anymore. I'll know what's going on. I just need to figure out how to shut down the cameras.







During the outage a few days ago, the cameras were shut off for a long time. I just needed to get lucky enough. I should go to Vegas sometime because, after about 30 minutes of quick reading through encyclopedias, I found a weird book trying to convert people to a foreign indian cult. It looked like it had been translated to Chinese, then English by a four-year-old who didn't speak either language. I slowly read it for hours, waiting for the clock to tick down to 3, so I could click submit to the non-fiction tab. The thing was, though, that due to the stabbing yesterday, the police were in the building. They were just there to prevent it from happening again, but it would make the jobs of those people much harder.







At about 2:50, I submitted the book, and immediately the whole building shook. It was not as bad as the previous shaking, but it rocked the building to the point that the power went out for a bit, and the cameras were disabled. I crawled under my desk, I heard police try to evacuate people, and then the automatic gunfire. I heard screaming and shooting; they were trying to get people out the back door, but eventually the gunfire stopped. I crawled up from under the desk with my hands up and saw about 12 armed people, 40 bodies, and about 12 hostages still alive. They pointed their guns at me before lowering them slightly. They were dressed in robes with tactical vests placed over them, and they had their hoods down so they could wear bulletproof helmets. 







One of them, wearing a different-colored robe, spoke to me, ""Brother, you must open the elevator."" I was a single child, so I assume he was saying ""brother"" in a religious context. I ripped open the bag and pulled out the signal cloner. I walked to the elevator with the whole cult following me, placing the cloner on the card reader. It took a second, but it registered as green. The cult grabbed as many hostages as possible, crowding them into the elevator. I took my pistol out of the bag and hid it in my pocket.







After about 45 seconds of tense silence, the elevator screeched to a halt, the doors slowly opened to reveal 2 security guards with submachine guns, who started to open fire. But horribly, they only hit hostages as the cultists had kept the hostages closest to the door. They shot the guards over the hostages, only 5 hostages were still alive after this, as we moved through the building. We turned left into a printing room. It was constantly printing out pages and pages of information, some of which was the awful book that I had put into the system.







We continued into the next room, which was hot due to being the underground server room. The door was in the middle of the wall on the farthest side of the entrance, and thick cables ran through the whole room. I was suddenly having ideas and learning things despite not seeing anything. I thought about soup recipes, CQC, and other random ideas that were forcefully injected into my head. I felt my nose start to bleed as the cultist in the different colored robe reached his hand out to the doorknob. The door slowly cracked open. Purple light streaming out, but before he could open the door fully, a whole team of SWAT burst through the door. They started shooting immediately as we dived for cover. I pulled my pistol out and started shooting around the server racks. I blindly shot bullets until I stopped hearing gunfire. I looked out and saw 6 cultists left, 3 hostages, and none of the SWAT team still alive.







The head cultist grabbed the doorknob with haste and swung open the door. The purple glow was bright, and the cultists entered before me. I walked in and saw something I couldn't describe. A bloated god strung up by cables and being fed a constant stream of knowledge from large fiber optic cords connected to it. There was a room attached below it, a chamber. The leader opened the door, and before closing it, he began to speak.







""TODAY IS THE DAY OF OUR ENLIGHTENMENT! WE WILL BE ANGELS OF KNOWLEDGE! WE SHALL SPREAD THE LIGHT TO THE DARK OF THIS REALM!"" He closed the door shut, and a purple light emanated from the machine. It began to shake, and screaming was emanating from inside the machine. The door slid open to reveal that his nerve endings had poked out of his skin; it looked like he had thick hair all across his body. His eyes were covered with skin and then nerve fibers. His body turned a sickly shade of purple, and his lower jaw hung loose. It stumbled out before reaching upward for the eldritch abhorrence on the ceiling, the nerve fibers connecting to it before spreading to the floor. The remaining cultists gathered around him. One spoke out. ""Now we must connect."" I had seen infinity, and all I wanted to do was to see more. We all pointed the guns at ourselves and gathered around.







Six gunshots rang out, and when I pulled my trigger, all I heard was a click. I had used all my bullets in the previous firefight. Before I could grab a gun near me, I heard an explosion from behind me. People dressed in the same clothes as the man from the car, just wearing strange goggles, had blown up the heavy steel door.







""ON THE GROUND NOW DROP THE GUN DROP THE GUN"" I slowly lowered to the floor where I was bound and pepper-sprayed to the point I couldn't see. They dragged me out of the building, and the other hostages were not even allowed into the room. I was the only survivor to know that thing. To see it with my own eyes, unedited by whatever they were wearing. They put me through a rushed trial, and it wasn't fair. I didn't have any money at all, and was deemed insane within a 15-minute evaluation that I didn't even speak in.

I feel like ang toxic at exhausting ng community natin

Ang daming cheaters, ang daming emotionally unavailable, the hookup scene is a mess, nakakapagod mag build ng connections, ang superficial ng mga tao

It's just a never ending cycle of disappointment 

I'm 26 years old but I feel like I'm already in my 60s

Gahd, I just wanna retire

Go to the countryside,  feed some chickens, be a rich tito na maraming aso at pusa, embrace my singlehood, read a book, make some journals, and take a sip of my morning coffee

I'd love some input on structuring my next steps.,"My goal is to be honest and vulnerable and not too rambly (you might get a little, hope you don't mind). The TLDR: 37 US, got the snip and am child free with a moderate amount of debt. Own a condo and have a swell gf and a neat-o job in banking doing analytics with a degree in environment mgmt. Recent events have got me more shook up than a milkshake and I don't know the optimal course of action. I work in analytics in a role where the story is just as integral as the raw data and I will be treating this post the same. I hope this is not too disjointed and you know my intent is love and respect. I tried to break it into parts so you can easily respond without reading everything.

* The goal: get to a point in life where I am not in a constant state of anxiety. I would love to have my work be  more impactful and get involved more in a community. I'd also love to be stable in my relationships and enjoy media without having to vet it for being too close to the dark side of life all the time.

* The current situatuon: 37M, US citizen, Caucasian (if that matters), with a Masters degree in Environment and natural resources from out of country. Working in banking for just over 100k for the past year after years of clawing my way out of serving. Own a condo, 40% debt to income ratio, child free and have a long term gf since Feb. Since November of last year when I broke up with my gf of 4 years and some other big stuff (I wonder what...) I have had a lot of trouble managing my OCD and anxieties. I lost a lot of control in my life and whereas therapy has been great I feel addicted to news and use moderate alcohol consumption (maybe 2-4 beers over CDC guidelines for alcohol consumption per week) and previous to chronic panic attacks recreational edible usage (scared to reintegration after my last panic attack) to cope. My job is... fine. My bosses are wonderful and I love my coworkers. The work isn't challenging as much as it is a test of my will and I'm ahead on the projects while struggling to really identify what is next. I got a rebiew coming soon to talk to my boss about it but the recent RTO mandate has been a kick in the nuts. I have a lot of disposable time but I feel it is often wasted doing nothing or stalling.

* The blockers: First off, I can't figure out exactly what I want and am too exhausted to look. I just am kind of floating sometimes. Daily, I read/workout/clean and have a list of projects, movies, future trips, budgets, bills, etc. I have a list for everything. I collect comics, love my aquariums, have an affinity for hydroponics and aquaponics, enjoy bodyweight fitness, scuba diving and fire dancing. I'm a coffee afficionado and can get really into craft beer. I collect old pulp magazines, read a shit ton of philosophy and philosophy and have ideas ill never pull through. I emulate and love retro gaming. I have a small group of friends, but I don't have a stable community for most hobbies. I don't have seed money or space to start most of my hobbies or put together some community programs I'd love (like a CSA for aquaponics, building a quail hatchery, getting an apiary, doing cleanup  projects, restoration projects, converting an old TV to an automated fish tank or terrarium, brewing beer, no laptop to do some emulation or coding projects etc.). I still collect comics but I'm burnt out on reading holy texts or philosophy treaties and haven't found much that is distracting enough to get me engaged. If I'm not worried about AI/environment/geopolitical events/US politics I am worried about the relationship I am where my partner is too burnt out all the time to really share in a manner I find acceptable and instead feel like my life is always on hold waiting for her (not her fault, but it sucks). I can't tell where my short comings are results of me having too high of expectations, where my feelings are valid and where I'm being lazy vs burnt out. 

* Path A and branches: Involves getting into some volunteer programs, getting my laptop, allocating my funds to pay off some of my more annoying loans with a high balance or interest rate, keeping my travels moderate, talking to my partner and looking at a role in the bank I can transition up to or finding a new job in the US. In this scenario I am betting on things getting better in the US and the heat coming down a little. I think I am in a decent position and can only work about what is in my control in life. I could always move, live more frugal, etc. It gives me adaptability without uprooting my life again but comes at the cost of a lot of instability in the US. Money in short term is heavier to investing.

* Path B and branches: Start looking to get tf out. Pick 3 countries (probably Latin America one, Canada and European one) and just go for it. Talk to my partner and see her thoughts, brush up on skills and focus on paying off more heavy debts so I can allocate funds while I make a more aggressive plans and switch to neutral at work doing good work but not focusing on career advancements until my bonus comes in. It would be disruptive and I'd lose some of my security being from the US (assuming anybody wants one of us and we wouldn't be the first to get fired). Pick what I want to keep and sell and invest in small upgrades to the condo to get it ready to sell.

* The overarching decisions: There are a lot of short term decisions I'm making right now, namely having the conversation I'm having with you all with my partner; finding a spot to volunteer and put my energies regardless of my decision; drinking less and taking less edibles; mitigating my time on Reddit; getting back into yoga and exercise; normalizing my sleep schedule. I'm just overwhelmed and putting a lot of responsibilities on myself I don't need to. I think getting the laptop, talking to my GF and volunteering are going to be critical first steps. But any advice on what looks like a better plan or questions on how to move forward are welcome. In a perfect world I would be saving the earth. In a perfecter world we would all have UBI and focusing on our talents while no longer being beholden to billionaires and geriatrics.

1lz8pe6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1lz8pe6/some_tips_to_help_with_binge_eating_these_helped/,Some tips to help with binge eating (these helped me),"1. Figuring out your trigger foods- 
For me sugar was a really huge trigger whenever I saw chocolates or cake or anything too sweet I would eat all of it in one sitting even though i wasn't craving it neither was I hungry. So then the next thing I did was cut out sugar and trust me it helped me so much with my compulsive eating. 
2. Journaling whenever you have the urge to binge- 
Now this sounds like a typical advise somebody would give you but trust me it can help alot. Most of the times people either binge eat to numb themselves from all the stress they've been carrying around or sometimes people eat to feel something because they're so numb. These two situations are most common when It comes to compulsive eating.. so when you've the urge to binge eat really just journal for 5 minutes and ask yourself if you really want to eat it or are you just struggling with your emotions? Once you've understood the feeling dig deeper. So for example let's say you're binge eating due to stress now dig deeper.. where is that stress coming from? How can you fix it? If it's a family issue or something that isn't fixable then reach out for help.. find a similar community because food is never the answer. 
3. Sometimes people also binge simply because they're bored and for this what helped me the most was drinking tea or coffee instead of eating. You can also try new hobbies such as painting, writing, learning new dances, or maybe even chewing gum. 
4. Something that REALLY REALLY in my opinion helps alot is meal planning- 
Plan whatever you're going to eat throughout the day and when you're going to eat it. This helps alot for me personally it helped alot because when you don't have everything planned out you just idk eat whatever is in sight but when you have things planned out you usually just go with the plan because that's just how the brain works. Now if you're deep into your binge eating disorder the meal planning thing might not work for you at the start but give it time and try to stick to it. Just like meal planning also plan what snacks you'll have instead of restricting. 
5. Sometimes what helped me not to give into my compulsive eating was texting people sometimes even random people to distract myself. 
 All of these things were what helped me personally some of these advises are pretty basic but yeah if yall have anything new or any other advises plspls lmk I'm not fully recovered yet and I'd love to know. ",5,1752453794.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False

Ah, a day like any other, late and nobody gives a shit. Why would they? I was working until midnight to get a job ready for inspection.  

I walked into the shop and said Good Morning to the boys. Bill was standing there waiting for me it seemed. 

“You’re late,” he said. 

“Sorry, was at Keith’s place till about midnight, slept in a little,” I said 

“Is it ready for inspection at least? Cause once you’re done we’re starting The Plant,” he said with a smirk. 

“Course it’s done…” before I could finish what I was going to say a car alarm started blaring in the yard. 

Bill casually walked outside to see what was the matter and saw Turd trying to pull the wheel off my van with his bare hands. He was almost successful too as something had snapped and the wheel was bent at a 30 degree angle. 

“Dearest nephew, what the fuck do you think you’re doing?,” Bill said calmly and sweetly as if he were talking to a baby. 

* unintelligible grunting noises * 

After he responded, he proceeded to start gnawing on the tire of my van. 

“Well Jo, looks like you’ll ride with one of the other boys today,” Bill said. 

“Anyone in particular? I’m just meeting the inspector today and prepping for the plant job if everything passes?,” I said back to Bill. 

He thought for a second and said, “On second thought, take Lou’s truck. He’s still out of town and it’s better out there making me money than sitting here and wasting space.” 

*Where oh where did you go Lou.*

I smiled as Lou’s truck was one of those top of the line models with leather heated seats, ac and actual satellite radio. 
I
“The keys are in his office, grab them off his desk,” Bill said again. 

As I left for Lou's office I heard Turd whining like a puppy dog to Bill and a sharp crack like metal into bone. 

I walked into Lou’s office to grab his keys and saw his desk. It was a mountain of paperwork. Everything looked as if it was chaos. I was trying to find a needle in a haystack. I began searching his desk through the pile of paper, under the stacks of files and in between the rows of binders.  

*Where are you hiding Lou.*

Finally, I saw a leather tag poking out from the bottom of a stack of loose receipts. I pulled it out and there were the keys for his new truck. I turned the key over and there was something stuck to the bottom of it. It was a piece of tape that had some writing on it. I didn’t think much of it as most of the keys in the shop are labeled with something, an address, a license plate or a door number. It read ‘FHTAGN’. It must be his license plate number I thought. 

*Dreaming, he waits.*

While I was in Lou’s office I grabbed the phone to contact the inspector.

“Goodmorning, city dispatch, how may I direct your call?,” said the nice receptionist over the phone. 

“Southside plumbing inspector please,” I said. 

“Please hold,” 

“Thank you,” 

As the elevator music played on the phone, I remembered that the last inspection I’d done about 6 months ago was Jerry’s retirement blow out. Jerry was a good inspector, he knew his shit. I sat there wondering who the next inspector would be that was going to replace him. I didn’t have to wait long as he picked up the phone. 

*He?*

“I’m doing well, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Jo, calling from Lou’s, I was wondering if you could 
meet me at 444 Dunwich St for an inspection?,” I asked politely. 

“✋︎ ♍︎♋︎■︎📬︎ ☟︎□︎⬥︎ ♎︎□︎♏︎⬧︎ 📂︎📂︎🖳︎🗏︎📁︎ ⬧︎□︎◆︎■︎♎︎✍︎,” he replied.

“✋︎❼︎●︎●︎ ⬧︎♏︎♏︎ ⍓︎□︎◆︎ ⧫︎♒︎♏︎■︎📪︎ ♌︎⍓︎♏︎📬︎,” he said as he hung up the phone. 

What a nice fella I thought, as I went to Lou’a truck. 

*Fella? WHERE’S LOU?!*

As I went to Lou’s truck I remembered that I would need my tools to do any work this week. So I pulled his truck into the yard to swap my tools out of my van and into Lou’s truck. As I walked up to my van I noticed a large dark red stain near the bent wheel. I pulled my tools out of my van and into Lou’s truck, it was about 10:30 by the time I was done. Times sure flying by again. 

*Tic Toc*

I started towards Keith’s as I knew the drive would be about 30 minutes with a coffee shop stop. As I arrived on site at 11:15 I checked the gauges and tests I had run the night before and to my suprise, they still held. While I waited for the inspector I began writing about a story Dennis told me years ago about the theatre in town. As I was writing about what it was like with my friend before he left again

*Abandoned*

                                                 I heard a tap on my passenger side window. It was the inspector. He was beautiful, I couldn’t look away from him.

not anymore, a mere peon in the presence of perfection. 

I sat in silence as he left, I was nothing. I felt depressed. As I began to cry in despair I looked up. There was a statue on the dash. It was indescribable. 

I wept for joy, I knew where Lou was.

# Chapter 29: Echoes

The sun had long since dipped below the ocean’s edge, leaving the Okinawan sky painted in hues of purple and navy. The energy on campus, however, had not settled. Not after what happened at the court.

The crowd had dispersed, but not the noise. The whispers echoed in hallways and chat groups. Photos. Clips. “Did you see that shot?” “He didn’t even look.” “Who is he?”

**Reina’s POV**

*He was different. Not the way he played. The way he carried it. Like he meant it. Like it mattered.*

Reina sat on the cafeteria bench, barely touching her food. Naomi and Yuto chatted across from her, half-laughing, half-shouting, still riding the high. But Reina’s eyes were distant.

*Why does it make my chest feel weird to see him smile like that?*

The moment kept replaying in her mind—his calm stare, the crisp arc of the ball, the way he turned before it even landed.

*He didn’t care to impress. He just… needed to prove it to himself.*

**Elsa’s POV**

From her office window earlier, she’d seen it all. The form. The poise. The execution.

*Calculated. Timed. Executed with zero hesitation. That’s not luck. That’s intention.*

She was now at her desk, coffee untouched, documents forgotten.

*Kazuya Kinoshita.*

Her mind turned the name over like a stone. It had been a long time since a student rattled her. Most begged for approval. He? He didn’t even realize he was being watched.

*You’re not a ghost anymore. You’ve stepped into the light.*

**Later That Evening – Campus Cafeteria**

Naomi scrolled through her feed, gasping as she turned her phone toward the group. “It’s online! Look!”

The clip showed the final moments—the stepback, the turn, the swish. The camera shook with the roar.

Comments poured in:

* ""Who’s the transferee??""
* ""Is he from the Tokyo leagues?""
* ""Bro pulled a Curry and a Kobe in one shot.""

Naomi grinned at Kazuya. “You gotta give us your socials. We need to tag you!”

Kazuya paused mid-bite and gave her a small, apologetic smile. “I… don’t really use them.”

“Not even Instagram?” Naomi tilted her head.

Yuto stepped in. “He’s just not the type. Leave it.”

There was a silence that wasn’t awkward—just understood. Naomi backed off. Reina, however, kept watching him.

*Kazuya Kinoshita… who are you really?*

**Tokyo – Mini’s POV**

Mini sat on her cramped couch, hair tied up, laptop open on edits. A ping from a campus friend lit up her screen: “Yo, is this him?”

She clicked the link.

The video buffered, then played.

There he was. The stepback. The look-away. The silent crowd.

Then the explosion.

Her eyes filled. “You idiot… you actually smiled.”

She searched for his socials. LINE? Deleted. IG? Nothing. FB? Gone.

“You’re really trying to disappear, huh?”

She wiped her eyes and hit forward. Sent it to one person only:

**Chizuru Mizuhara**  
Message: *“Nagoya has lights. Okinawa has this.”*

**Nagoya – Chizuru’s POV**

She had just finished a long shoot. Her first endorsement. The hotel room was quiet, too cold, too clean.

Mini’s message popped up.

Chizuru hesitated—then pressed play.

She watched the clip once. Then again. And again.

The way he moved. Calm. Decisive. Then the smile. That soft, disbelieving smile as the crowd erupted around him.

*That’s not the boy who clung to me like I was his lifeline.*

*That’s a man learning to stand alone.*

Her hand trembled.

She didn’t reply. She just sat there, lips trembling, tears slipping quietly.

“I’m happy for you,” she whispered to the screen. “Even if it hurts.”

**Okinawa – Shoreline, Near 2AM**

Kazuya sat on the same rock from his first night. Hoodie pulled up. Empty coffee cup in hand. Phone buzzing in his pocket. He didn’t check it.

*I didn’t mean to be seen.*  
*But maybe I didn’t want to be invisible either.*

He closed his eyes. The waves crashed with gentle persistence.

Then—footsteps.

He didn’t turn.

“You’ll catch a cold like that,” a voice said evenly.

He looked up.

She stood there. Long coat, quiet eyes. In her hands—two steaming cups.

Elsa.

She offered one. No words, just presence.

He took it slowly. “Thanks.”

She sat beside him without asking. Both stared at the sea.

The silence didn’t need to be filled.

**2:03 AM.**

The stars above shimmered faintly.

And Kazuya… didn’t feel alone.

# Chapter 30: 4AM Conversations

The ocean breeze had settled into a hush, and the stars glittered quietly above the Okinawan shoreline. Kazuya sat cross-legged on the sand, cradling a cup of coffee between his hands, steam curling into the cool pre-dawn air. A soft glow peeked from the eastern horizon, not yet morning, not quite night. Beside him, Elsa mirrored his posture, her hair down for once, falling like silk around her shoulders.

There were no titles tonight. No student. No professor. No expectation. Just two people trying to hold space for their own survival.

Kazuya had changed.

Gone was the awkward boy who once stumbled over apologies and clung to the weight of others' expectations. Okinawa had weathered him—like sea and wind wear smooth the edges of driftwood. His hair, once black and neatly parted, now waved gently in amber curls, sun-kissed and unruly. The longer strands brushed his collar, some tied in a half-knot when he didn’t feel like taming it.

He wore loose, cream-colored linen and rolled-up trousers. Around his neck hung a small coral pendant gifted by a girl he helped at the fish market. His bracelet was handmade, his sneakers dusty. He looked… lived-in. Present.

He had walked into the rooftop gathering earlier that evening with his usual quiet smile. Not expecting anything. Just grateful. Elsa had watched him laugh over drinks, genuinely, like the weight on his chest had lifted. Reina had stared, wide-eyed. Naomi had wiped her eyes when she thought no one was looking.

But now it was **2:10 a.m.**

The laughter had faded, and only the tide remained.

Elsa took a slow sip of her coffee, letting the heat warm her lips. ""I don’t usually stay up past two,"" she said, voice low. ""You should feel honored.""

Kazuya glanced sideways. ""You don’t usually show up to parties either.""

""You noticed.""

""Hard not to.""

They chuckled.

A breath passed between them. Steady. Unrushed.

Kazuya drew in a lungful of sea air. Then, exhaling, he finally said, “I placed my worth on someone. Built my self-esteem on how much I could mean to them. I gave everything I had. Thought… if I loved hard enough, they’d love me back.”

Elsa stayed silent, not out of pity, but respect.

“I was wrong,” he added. “They didn’t do anything wrong, really. But when they walked away, I broke.”

A pause. The kind that carried weight.

“I realized,” he continued, “I never knew how to live just for myself.”

His fingers flexed around the coffee cup. The words tasted strange, foreign, even now.

Elsa nodded slightly, her gaze fixed on the waves. ""When I was thirteen, I told my parents I wanted to quit school.""

Kazuya turned to her, surprised.

""I was exhausted. Burnt out from trying to prove I belonged in every room I entered. The pressure to be flawless wasn’t just from others—it came from me, too.""

He didn’t speak. But he didn’t look away.

Elsa smiled faintly, bitter. ""People assume I breeze through everything. That it’s effortless. But every perfect answer, every top score… costs something.""

Kazuya looked down. His voice was soft. “We’re both trying not to disappear.”

Elsa met his eyes. And nodded. “Exactly.”

A quiet reverence filled the space between them.

He picked up a small shell nearby, rolling it between his fingers. ""You’re the first person who asked what I’m doing here without assuming I’m running from something.""

She tilted her head. “Aren’t you?”

He gave a tired smile. “I am. So are you.”

The stars twinkled above them, cold and forgiving.

By **4:07 a.m.,** the coffee had gone cold, but neither of them cared.

Elsa stretched slowly, her back popping as she stood. “Class in four hours. I should go.""

Kazuya rose too. “Thanks. For tonight.”

She looked at him. ""For listening?""

“For asking.”

They didn’t hug. Didn’t promise anything.

They just looked.

Long enough to say everything.

# Chapter 31: The Weight Replaced by Water

At dawn in December, the Okinawan shoreline awakens in hushed tones, as the sky slowly blushes from deep violet to soft lavender. A cool, salt-kissed breeze sweeps across the tranquil waters, greeting the first gentle light peeking from the eastern horizon.

The boy who once arrived in Okinawa with hunched shoulders and hollow eyes had changed—visibly, unmistakably. His once-orange dyed hair had faded and grown out, revealing its natural dark brown hue, sun-kissed at the tips from early mornings in the surf. His posture had straightened, his presence quieter but more grounded. The hollowness in his gaze had receded, replaced by a distant calm. People began to notice—not just the surface change, but the serenity that followed him like a breeze.

It is Tuesday.

Kazuya was already up, tying his board to the rental scooter. The morning air smelled of salt and wind. He jogged down to the beach where Yuto was stretching near the shoreline.

“Thought you’d bail on me,” Yuto said, tossing him a protein bar.

“I’m not the same guy anymore,” Kazuya replied with a half-smile.

The two paddled out together. The early waves were tame, glassy. Several girls in wetsuits took notice, whispering from the beach as they watched the two carve lines into the water. Yuto was the usual object of attention, but now it was Kazuya who caught lingering gazes—his lithe frame balanced on the board, eyes half-lidded, expression unreadable. Quietly confident. Effortlessly cool.

“Kinoshita-kun’s hot now, huh?” one girl murmured.

“Like a surfed-up J-drama lead,” another giggled.

Kazuya didn’t notice. Or if he did, he didn’t react.

After the session, towel draped over his neck, he bumped—literally—into someone near the path.

“Ah, sorry,” he said instinctively, eyes lifting.

It was Elsa. Dressed in simple black linen, sipping a coffee with one earbud in.

Their eyes met.

“Morning,” she said.

Kazuya nodded. “Morning.”

They shared a smile. No small talk. Just a brief exchange of warmth before parting.

She kept walking, hiding the faint smile tugging at her lips. *He’s different,* she admitted to herself. *It suits him.*

Later that morning, at 7:55 a.m., Kazuya sat on the bench by the courtyard—their usual meeting spot. Yuto arrived first, Reina next, Naomi last.

They were now known as the Quad. A once-untouchable trio slowly grounded by the one who had quietly healed in their presence. They were still loud, still stylish—but now, they arrived on time. Kazuya’s quiet consistency had rubbed off.

“You’re always too early,” Reina remarked, plopping beside him.

“I like the stillness,” he said.

Naomi threw an arm over Yuto’s shoulder. “I still don’t get how you turned us into morning people.”

Kazuya smirked, shouldering his bag. “Magic.”

Class that day felt different. Energized.

Kazuya answered two questions, raised one of his own. When he spoke, the room stilled. His voice wasn’t loud, but it was clear, thoughtful. A group of girls whispered in the back.

“I swear he wasn’t like this last semester.”

“Didn’t he used to be… kind of broken-looking?”

“I think he’s kind of perfect now.”

Reina heard. She coughed loudly and shot them a look.

Later that day, after a study session ended, Kazuya was stopped on campus by one of the art department’s most popular girls—Aya, bright-eyed and always surrounded by admirers.

“I… I’ve seen you around,” she began, twirling her bracelet. “And I know this is sudden, but—would you like to go out sometime? Maybe coffee or…”

Kazuya gave her a gentle, apologetic smile. “Thank you. That’s kind of you. But I’m not… in a place for that right now.”

She blinked. “Oh… okay.”

He bowed slightly and walked off, unfazed.

From a distance, Reina and Naomi had seen the whole thing.

“He really said no,” Naomi whispered.

“Of course he did,” Reina muttered. Her arms were crossed.

By lunchtime, the Quad gathered in their usual cafeteria spot. Laughter and plates passed freely. Kazuya was relaxed, sleeves rolled up, arms lean and sun-kissed.

“So, anyone going home for Christmas?” he asked between bites.

Yuto nodded. “Family expects me. Might sneak Naomi along.”

Naomi winked. “They like me better anyway.”

Reina twirled her chopsticks. “Probably spending it at our beach house. You?”

“I’ll be here,” Kazuya said simply. “More time to surf. Save money. Practice. Study.”

The others exchanged glances. The mood shifted, just slightly—concern threading beneath their usual rhythm.

From the mezzanine above, Elsa walked past. She did so every lunch now. Always the same path, always the same glance downward toward their table.

Rumors had started.

“Bayer-sensei always passes by the Quad,” a student once said.

“Think she likes the surfer boy?”

But any who dared bring it up received an icy stare that silenced them for good.

Reina, however, noticed. And while she tried to play it cool, Naomi caught the small, irritated huff that slipped out every time Elsa appeared.

After lunch, as they stepped out into the courtyard, Yuto clapped a hand on Kazuya’s shoulder. “Hey. About New Year’s?”

“We’re not letting you spend it alone,” Naomi said firmly.

Reina nodded. “We’ve already decided. Quad stays together.”

Kazuya blinked. A moment passed. Then—

“Okay.”

He smiled.

And something about it made the others quietly proud.

I’m a church abuse victim and stayed away, but within the past year and a half rejoined a local church.  It was absolutely fantastic! i felt at home,rebuilt my connection with Christ, even got baptized and have strengthened my walk with Him. I love worship, the songs, and the sermons are great! mostly…

Over the past couple months, I fear the lead pastor has fallen off the deep end perhaps. My boyfriend, who works at a nearby coffee shop claims that he brandished a metal bat at the drive thru workers over a messed up order. The pastor has gone on crying screaming rants about people needing to join the children’s ministry using guilt tripping. On his birthday, there was an at least 20 minute segment where other leaders were glazing the pastor and his achievements. There was even a life size cut out of him in the lobby. Over time, he’s gone on progressively longer segments about tithing. He said today “the Lord is putting a number on your heart, maybe it’s a scary number, but that’s the spirit of fear! Double it!” and this wouldn’t be as large of a problem for me if both the pastor AND his wife  weren’t  rocking designer clothes and 500$ custom nike shoes inspired by our small worship groups. 

The one thing that pushed me over today that gave me the biggest ick was what felt like manipulation. Pastor was in a sermon about the spirit of fear and made a statement claiming that if you want to leave **insert my church’s name**, that’s the enemy speaking and the spirit of fear trying to make you doubt and  keep you from your destiny in God. Any doubt in this church is the enemy speaking. This makes me feel really weird. really really really weird. 

There’s more that makes me uncomfortable, but I’m worried it is just the enemy/devil getting to me. Am I just not devoted enough and that’s why this seems odd? It doesn’t seem normal to me, but I’m just so lost. I don’t know what’s right here, and I’m shrouded in confusion. I don’t think Jesus would want me to feel the way I do in this church. I feel manipulated and betrayed. I trusted this church a lot.  I’ve been praying over it, but I want to know if anyone has advice or gone thru something similar.

1lz8ji2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Joplumber/comments/1lz8ji2/seven_deadly_lous/,Seven Deadly Lous,"At the shop this morning we had the regular faces. I was early for once. That's because we were working on my first job I had been assigned as a foreman.

Laz Healthcare was the hardest job I have encountered so far. It's not like I haven't had good help either. Turd was banned from the site the first hour he was there. Something about “wandering into the lab or some shit”. They said he was muttering and trying to break down the door. I had Lou pick him up immediately. Ever since I've had Zeke and Izzy. They're smart guys, but they're green. The whole job is to install some new bathrooms and the some acid piping for the new lab.

Bill told me the job should take 5 weeks. After looking at the plans, I figured I could get it done in 3. Oh how I was wrong. It was Friday on the third week and we weren't even close to making the 5 week deadline. I have a tailgate meeting every morning to discuss site safety and what jobs the boys and I will be doing today.

“Zeke, Izzy, come here. We’re making a game plan for today.”

“Lemme guess, drill more holes?” said Zeke

“Yea,” I responded exhaustedly.

“Tefucinhelaralltheezgonefer,” said Izzy

“The holes are for the piping Izzy. I'm trying to run it as fast as you’re drilling them. How many are we at Zeke?”

“313”

“How many do you have left abouts?”

“Teneac,” said Izzy

“Figure we can get those 20 done today?”

“We’d be pushing hard at that rate. It is about an hour a hole in some places.”

“Do the best you can.”

“Ferckinryin”

“I know Izzy, I was hoping to have the job completed this week.”

After that brief tailgate meeting, the boys had their jobs and I had mine. The day proceeded as normal. I went to where I was working and set my radio up. I go a bit crazy if I don't have something playing in the background on my jobsites. Today I was listening to these two guys yap away about scary stories they've read. I like these two. One is some kid from Appalachia, you know what they say about people from Appalachia, and the other is some old dude who's got a kickass neckbeard according to the kid. They spend hours yammering on about spooky shit. However, the noise they make helps me concentrate.

I continued working and at lunch break I asked the boys to give me a progress update.

“Zeke, how we doing?”

“Way we’re going today, we may just hit that deadline,” Zeke said enthusiastically.

“Gotreelef, ezegerttoo,” said Izzy.

“Make’s 5, we’ll see if we're lucky by the end of the day.”

We, in fact, we’re not lucky. Zeke did fine with his final 2 holes, Izzy however…

“FERCKINPICEOFERCKINSHIET!”

a sound of something heavy and expensive hitting a wall then proceeding to fall to the floor

“IZ! The fuck are you doing?” I shouted

“TISFERCKINOLESFERCKINWENTIFERVFERCKINFETTICK! TEFERCK, TELESTFERCKINOLE! FERCKTISFERCKINTUPIDFERCKINJHOB!”

“Walls only supposed to be a foot thick Izzy, did you mark it where it supposed to be on the plan? You could’ve hit a structural column?”

“UMERKDTEOLE! DONNTFERCKINAYEYEFERCKINRILLEDTEFERCKINOLE!”

“Well, I’ve been wrong before Izzy, I can be wrong again. Let’s go check on the plans and have a coffee,” I said calmly.

Izzy muttered under his breath angrily as we went to my makeshift on-site office.

“Look Izzy, there’s a column right next to where you’re drilling, guess it was just a little bigger than the plans said. I fucked up buddy, I’m sorry I tried to blame you.”

“Isnotyeristeferckinjhob, iferckinateferckinbeinher.”

“Do you hate your career? Buddy you’ve been doing this for 3 years with us. I thought you loved it?”

“Iontferckinateeingaferckinlumber, Iferckinatedisferckinjhob, isgivinmeighmars” said Izzy frustratedly.

“Yea, I hear you Izzy. It’s getting to me too. I’ve found myself waking up with a cold sweat or two about this job lately,” I said exhaustedly.

“Isyerirstjhobyergertnerosses,” said Izzy concernedly.

“Don’t remind me, I’ve wanted to call Bill, Bob or Lou and ask what the fuck to do on a few occasions,” I laughed.

“Disjhobiskillinus.”

Izzy’s comment hung in the air as we walked quietly to where Zeke was. He had heard the commotion Izzy had made and must’ve tidied things up while we were checking the plans.

“Well Zeke, thanks for cleaning up. I’ve gotta check that location I marked for Izzy. Seems like I fucked up.”

I checked the location of the hole.

“There’s not supposed to be a support here,” I said as Zeke looked into the hole.

“This sure looks like a support.”

“Well throw the last extension on the drill and we’ll see if Lou can talk his way outta repairing it if I'm wrong.”

Izzy did as I asked and almost immediately went through.

“Guess we are lucky today,” I said to the two.

Zeke looked into the final hole.

“Why’s it dark? Should be through to the other side, right?”

I walked into the room we were drilling into. The lights were on, but no hole.

“Where the hell is that going? Izzy can you push further into the hole?”

Izzy did as I asked.

“Asferasshellger,” said Izzy

He was in about four feet. The specs on the supports say they're solid all the way through and three feet thick.

“Zeke grab me a length of pipe.”

“Twelve foot piece or twenty-one?”

“Twenty-one.”

He brought the length over and I pushed into the hole. We were able to slide the entire length in. Puzzled, I stepped back to assess the situation.

“Pull the pipe out Zeke. I have a feeling we’ll have to drill a new hole.”

Zeke pulled the pipe, but it didn’t move. Suddenly the pipe jerked Zeke towards the hole. He let go and the pipe vanished.

“Teferck?” Said Izzy.

Astonished at what we’d just witnessed, I spoke up.

“We still need to go through that wall, I guess drill it lower?,” I said with a tone lacking confidence.

So Zeke mounted the drill back up and drilled another hole. Before I could get going on what I was working on, I heard Zeke shouting for me. I walked briskly back to where he was working. He was through, but we still had the same problem. There was a hole too somewhere but not where we needed to go. Finally, I had enough and grabbed my flashlight to take a look through the holes to see if I was missing something.

“What do you see up there boss,” said Zeke.

“It’s a massive room about 40ft deep by 60ft wide, it looks like a laboratory,” I said.

I thought in my head if we actually drilled through the labs walls but there’s no way I had, it was a hundred feet in the other direction and plus I’d seen the interior of that lab, it was completely different.

I shined my light through the hole to the centre of the room. It’s light reflected of 7 massive glass tank.

“Holy shit! It looks like a sci-fi movie. There’s tanks that look like you could float…,” I trailed off.

It was then I noticed there were things floating in the tanks. They’re were small, barely noticeable in the liquid filling the tanks. Only 4 of the tanks were full. 3 of them contained what looked to be masses of cells, though the 4th explained why the looked that way. It was a baby. It was curled in a ball. I thought it wasn’t developed enough but I noticed it was missing a hand.

Under all the tanks was a nameplate. It appeared the first empty three were:

L04WR

L04GR

L04EN

The last 4 were

L04GL

L04SL

L04LU

L04PR

It was the oddest scene. I couldn’t describe it to my apprentices, that’s why I told them to look.

“Guys you have to see this,” I said.

Both Izzy and Zeke climbed the ladder and looked into the holes.

1lz8hrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1lz8hrv/so_disappointed/,So disappointed ...,"I've wanted a KGBV for so long, I couldn't wait for the one I snagged on the Prime Day sale to get here!  But man, I have not been this disappointed with a product in some time.  I'm curious if others have felt the same way and if maybe I'm just missing something.  Otherwise, this thing is going back.  

  
First off, no amount of reviews and complaints about the cheap feel of some parts, namely the glass carafe, could have prepared me for how unimpressive they actually were.  I get that they are supposed to be easily replaceable. But the ultra-thin-walled glass carafe and even thinner plastic handle on the KBGV make the carafe from the $25 Mr. Coffee pot I have from my college days feel like the Rolls-Royce of carafes!

  
I'd like to think I could get over the lackluster quality ""feel"" from an appliance as long as the performance still puts it head and shoulders above the competitors.  But sadly, it does not.  It makes a solid pot of coffee, but nothing better to justify the price tag on this thing, even with the deal. 

 After two days of brewing a few pots on just the Moccamaster, I did a taste test between our old maker (a Ninja CM300) and a pour over.  I usually use a medium-fine grind for the pour over, but this time around used the same grind (medium-to-coarse) for all three methods. Same water was used for all 3 methods.

**Taste Test:**  
 I knew which was which, but my SO did not (so the results were half-blinded at least).  We both had the same results. I let her guess first so I didn't lead her to any conclusion. She quickly identified the pour-over as being far superior in quality to the others.  Neither of us could detect a noticeable difference between the Moccamaster and our $110 Ninja.  (I should note, the Ninja was brewed on ""Rich"" mode - we never use the classic setting - both were full pots with the recommended grams of coffee for their respective full pot - 69 g for the KBGV and 80g for the Ninja (slightly larger resivore/carafe on the Ninja). 

  
I am not sure what to think.  Is this typical?  Have others had a similar experience? If so, why all the hype behind the Moccamaster?  Any suggestions on what else I could try to improve the flavor? (not that there are many strings to pull here).  We typically like medium-dark and dark roasts and drink them black.  Those that swear by the Moccamaster do you drink a lighter roast?  Or do you doctor (read: bastardize) it up with milk and sugar?  Has anyone compared the Prime Deals models with older models? I'm partly wondering if these were rushed for Prime Days, similar to how the quality of many TVs sold on Black Friday are subpar to those slated for normal sale. 

  
I get that the Moccasmaster's warranty and supposed quality should be better than that of my Ninja and many other coffee makers.  But when my Ninja eventually dies, I can just go out and get another one for a third of the price of the Moccamaster. ",2,1752453167.0,Moccamaster,6,0.63,False

It is not the taste I seek but the ritual, the small defiance of a meaningless morning. They say these things will kill me. But death is not the question.
The real question is what to do while I wait. Coffee and cigarettes make no promises, they're not hope, not distraction. Just presence. Immediate, burning, scalding, momentary. Coffee cools too fast, cigarette burns too quickly... like life? like thought? Like the silence that follows our questions to the void? Perhaps that's all we can do, drink the bitter, inhale the fire.

He learned to run before he could reason,
crashing through the quiet with juice-sticky hands,
drawing on walls, climbing the dog,
spinning wild in pajamas—

At ten, he forgot shoes and wore bruises like medals,
chased sunsets with scraped knees,
made forts from junk and magic,
believed every worm was a friend—

By thirteen, he folded into silence,
shoulders hunched, voice caught between octaves,
rolled eyes and slammed doors,
questions too big for either of us—
and loved.

At seventeen, he drove too fast and spoke too little,
stayed out late, said “I’m fine” like a password,
heart full of sparks he didn’t yet trust—
and loved.

Then one day, he towered above me,
calling me “Dad” in a voice I once carried.
He poured coffee for us both,
told me what he planned,
what he feared—

Now he’s got a boy of his own,
who cries, and runs, and breaks things,

I walk into the shop and punch in like usual. Lou doesn’t even look at me anymore or shake his head. I guess that’s what 20 years of always showing up a little late does. As I walk through the shop I give Lou’s guys their morning pleasantries.

“Morning, Brandon”

“Morning, Jo”

“How are you today?”

“Living the Dream”

“You’re dream or someone else’s?”

We both laugh as this is the same conversation we’ve had about a thousand times now.

*It’s too bad.*

I walk out to the garage where the plumbers meet. Maury, Brent, Mini Zeke, and Bruce are all waiting for their morning jobs from our dispatcher. Darryl doles out the morning jobs like usual. Maury and Brent are going to fix some leak in an apartment complex, Bruce gets the joy of unplugging a few toilets that have this mysterious goo coming out of them. The people in that office building have probably never seen their own shit before, but hey people are entitled to think poo and goo are one and the same. These guys are the current crew we have. Turnovers are high here at “Lou’s Plumbing and Heating Co.” Somehow I have more seniority than almost everyone here.

“Here comes the straggler!” says Bruce

In walks Louis Jr. the Third. I shouldn’t say walk. It’s more like a deranged shuffle. Louis Jr. the Third, or as we call him Lou the turd, is our dear proprietor's son. He’s a dick. He’s also weird. He likes to sit slightly too far away from everyone. He also smells a little rotten, like right before the milk is curdled. He’s been here supposedly forever, or so he tells everyone.

*Lies.*

Anyhow this morning the Turd walks in with a pile of paperwork, and before I can say anything…

“Holy shit, you know how to read?” says Mini Zeke

And in a high nasally voice “Well you’re one to talk, didn’t your dad drop you on your head when you were a baby? Oh right, he wasn’t even around when you were born. Guess your stupidity drove him to kill himself.”

“Ladies please”

In walks Bill. He’s our boss and Lou’s adopted brother.

“What my dear illiterate nephew meant to say was, we have some new training documents to go over. We got a big job at the plant starting next month and we have some safety training I need you guys to familiarize yourselves with.” I felt the room turn to ice when Bill brought up The Plant. I glanced around the office and saw Mini. He was stiff as a board. I casually said

“Hey Bill, are we decommissioning the boiler?”

“We’re not just decommissioning it, we’re replacing it, Jo.”

“How are we gonna do it? That thing is the size of a 12-story building.”

*They're all burning.*

“We’ve partnered with Trent and George to supply the manpower, and you’ll be working with Chris and Andreas as Leads.

“Fuck Andreas, Chris I understand, but Andreas?”

“I didn’t like it either, but we needed a demolition crew and I thought I could benefit with you and Chris elsewhere.”

“So why Trent and George then? Thought you hated each other?”

“We came to find that working together after all these years is mutually beneficial”

“Uh huh, how big is the contract?”

“Twelve million”

“Shouldn’t it cost more in the neighbourhood of six to seven million?”

The last one I did, a fly-in job in Northern Ontario, was about five point five million. If you factor in all the inflation, the “supply chain issues” and all the salesman bullshit. It should only be a few million more, but more than double?

“Are we removing the old boiler?”

“Not exactly, we’re going to leave the skeleton and repair the holes in it and update the burner box.”

Whatever you do won’t work. It will happen again.

“When can I see the plans?”

“Next week, I’ll have the engineer fax us a couple of copies.”

Ah yes, the trusty dusty fax machine we’ve had since 1987. We’re real cavemen here at Lou’s. Our 24/7 emergency service still runs off a pager. Every invoice is handwritten. And to top it all off. One computer in the business. I’m pretty sure it’s just so the old bat, who’s been the secretary here since before I was born, can go on Facebook and watch some porn. She’s a really pleasant lady.

And that was it for what old Bill had to say, he grabbed a coffee and went back to his office.

“So Darryl, what do you have for me?”

“Remember Frank?”

“Frank Sinatra?”

“No Farmer Frank, your best buddy.”

I do not remember who farmer Frank is and how he’s my best buddy, but Darryl is sure every client is our best buddy.

“Okay, what’s going on at my buddy’s place?”

“His wood furnace went out, he tried to fix it himself but couldn’t do anything to help his situation.”

“Why am I going there? This sounds like a job for the heating crew.”

Though I know how to do this sort of work, I’m more on the installing boilers, large new construction projects and plumbing service repairs side of things.

“He asked for you, he’s been getting us to work on that thing for years. You may have worked on it too. It’s a piece of shit. Johnny services it every year. Get some info from him about it before you head there.”

“Sounds good.”

“And take Mini Zeke with you. Can’t leave the boy sheltered all day and I can’t send him with Turd.”

We all looked at Lou the Turd, he was scratching himself furiously and muttering under his breath. He didn’t hear what Darryl said.

*He hears everything.*

I wrangled up Mini Zeke and we walked over to our other shop to talk with the head of the heating crew, Johnny.

He’s a wizard. He can look at a system that’s just a mess and solve it in about 5 minutes. So when I spoke with him about farmer Franks, his response was…

Interesting.

“Johnny boy, Farmer Frank called, said his wood boiler was on the fritz again. Darryl said you would have some ideas.”

“Why the fuck are you going there? I told Lou to never go back there,” he said angrily.

“Greedy fucker.”

“Lou never listens when we tell him anything.”

“Ain’t that fucking right. Last I was there was bout a year ago. That’s an original Angel Fire Furnace. Fuckers never worked quite right. You can adjust the flame all you like but there’s never enough heat coming out of them.” I remembered an old Angel Fire Furnace commercial from when I was a teen. Some guy was dressed poorly in an Angel costume, holding a flaming sword for some reason. At the end of the commercial he always said, “Because when hell freezes over, only an Angle Fire furnace will keep you warm.”

I chuckled at that.

“Whatcha laughing about boy?”

“Remember the old Angel Fire commercials?”

“Fucking stupid commercials. When hell freezes over my ass. Lou was dumb enough to believe that shit.”

We’re the only company in the small town, and within a thousand kilometres, that works on and installs Angel Fire Furnaces.

“He gets them for a good deal, and the new units are pretty damn good from what I hear.”

“You don’t work on these pieces of shit every day, they haven’t changed. Sure they’ve gotten smaller, more ‘efficient’, but they still have the same problem. Not enough heat. I can get Lou to oversize the one he sells to the next idiot that walks in, but I know that next winter we’ll get the call saying it’s too cold. Lou’s pretty good at telling them to wear a blanket and giving them the same old spiel. “Nobody makes a furnace for our weather, it’s -50 some days, and 30 above the next.” He’s right when you’re dealing with Angel Fire, but the new furnaces they’re selling at the supplier they’re great. The only issue is that they get too hot…” he trailed off.

“So what do you figure is wrong with Frank’s? Bad pump? Broken line? Air shutters are closed?”

“Nah, Franks a smart old fucker, he’d have checked that. He only calls if he can’t figure it out.”

Johnny paused for a second. The room suddenly became chilly. He spoke in a harsh voice much quieter than normal.

“I reckon it’s the burner box, there’s a thermal reset switch inside. The switch is supposed to shut down the unit if it gets too hot, but I’ve only ever changed one in 40 years.”

“So why do you think it’s that then?”

“Cause Farmer Franks was where I changed it, and that’s why I told Lou never to go back to that thing.”

*When Hell freezes over, only Angel Fire will keep you warm.*

So with that Mini Zeke and I grabbed a thermal reset switch from Lou’s part warehouse and headed out to Franks.

It was about an hour and a half drive through the country with our shitty work van. Thanks, Lou, bald tires, broken windshield, the clock didn’t work for shit and rear-wheel drive in winter in Canada. At least the heater works. After getting the van stuck and shovelling it out for another hour we arrived at Franks.

“Oh yeah, I’ve been here before, a long time ago. I think I was with Bob. No, it was Bill. This was just after the plant shut down and Bob started at Lou’s. Holy shit that was almost 2 decades ago.”

Mini shot me a look, I could see the fear creeping towards his eyes.

“Don’t talk about The Plant.”

“Sorry Mini, I forgot about that. Bob brings me back to the beginning of my career. I learned a lot from that guy.”

We continued to chat as we walked up to the door.

knock knock

After 5 minutes there was no answer. “Let’s check the barn”

As we walked across the yard about 30 or so meters from the house was the furnace. They’re big units. Big enough to get rid of a few bodies we always joked.

They are a metal shed with a steel door about a meter by a meter. You open the door and throw wood inside. You turn the fan up at the back to get more heat out of it and a pump moves a combination of water and antifreeze around the outside to heat the home. Simple units really.

“That must be Frank,” Mini Zeke pointed towards the barn.

As we walked past the furnace we saw farmer Frank working on a tractor.

“Hey, Frank!”

“Well, how are you now boys?”

“Good and you?” Me and Mini said at the same time.

“Better since you two are here.”

Farmer Frank looks to be in his 70’s, still spry for an old fella.

*Tic toc, tic toc.*

“I don’t know what’s wrong with the damn thing, I can’t get it to light, I can’t get the pump to go.”

“Me and Mini will take a look to see if we can get you some heat for tonight.”

“Good luck boys”

Me and Mini walked back to the furnace. Hopeful because as Frank mentioned he couldn’t get it to light meaning the fire was out. I could’ve sworn there was smoke coming out of the chimney though. Must’ve been my imagination.

“Well Mini, want to try the thermal reset?” “I thought you said there’s no way it’s the thermal reset.”

“Well, is it possible I was wrong and there’s only one way to cut power to the entire system and it’s through that reset, right?”

“Well yea, but you? Wrong? Not you. Never you,” he says as a smirk appears on his face. “Smart ass”

Mini and I opened the door to the furnace to find no fire, but curiously also no thermal reset. “Where is it?”

“I don’t know Mini. Can you ask Frank if he’s got a manual for this thing?”

“Sure.”

As Mini went to find Frank again, I went to pull the van closer to the furnace. After I did that I grabbed my portable flashlight, some rags, vinegar and an air compressor. I grabbed my diesel heater and fired it up to thaw the vinegar and keep my hands from freezing as I cleaned and looked for that reset.

I saw Mini walking back a few minutes later. “So does he have anything?”

“Says he might have it in his attic. He’ll come over if he finds it.”

As we waited, we began cleaning the creosote and soot out of the burner box. We got it about half cleaned before we heard farmer Frank walking up to us.

“Here’s the manual boys.”

He handed me a tome. An actual tome. Leatherbound with parchment paper in between the bindings. It’s said on the front cover Angel Fire Model No. 4. It had the old Angel Fire logo under the title. I always found it odd. It was a larger circle to the left of a square opening. Lou said it was about some old story from an ancient book. Strange, he never mentioned what the book was called though. I blew the dust off of it.

*4 days, 4 temptations, 4 bodies.*

“Thanks, Frank”

Frank walked back to his tractor

“Alright Mini, keep cleaning, I’m going to sit in the van and read a bit more about this furnace. Come grab me if you need me”

“Must be nice, sit in the heat and I’ll stay out here and freeze.”

“Shouldn’t have been a smart ass then.”

I laughed and walked to the van. I opened the manual to a strange scene. The first page was a picture of the wood boiler. The second page was a table of contents, but it had 4 horses at each corner of the page. Looking at these pages, I felt cold. Colder than the outside of the van.

*When hell freezes over.*

I skimmed the table of contents and found what I was looking for.

IV. MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING I flipped to page four and skimmed until I found a picture of where the thermal reset was supposed to be located.

“How the fuck did Johnny change that?” I jumped as Mini was banging on my window. I rolled it down.

“What’s up, buddy?”

“Look.”

He handed me a dog tag, it said Sadie. I flipped it over and on the back, it read Frank 555-387-6223 and under that, a name looked as if it had been scratched out with a razor blade.

“Yea?”

“I found it in the furnace.”

He paused

“Underneath it was the thermal reset switch.”

“What’s wrong Mini?”

“It felt warm when I grabbed it.”

“Furnace could’ve still been holding some heat.” I reassured him.

“Sure. That’s why the vinegar was freezing when I was spraying it out.”

“I’ll go talk to Frank about it. Don’t worry, just finish up cleaning and we can swap the reset and go home. It’s getting late.”

I’d started to notice the sun getting lower since I sat in the van. It felt like we only got here an hour ago. Guess it’s just my imagination. It must’ve taken longer to get here than I thought.

“Fucking Lou should’ve gotten that damn clock fixed a year ago when I told him.”

Customers don’t like it when I bill them off a sundial.

I got out of the van and started walking towards where Frank was.

“Hey Frank, I think your dog lost their tag.”

“My dog?” He solemnly chuckled

“Sadie died last week, I put her down behind the barn. Then I sent her back to god.”

“I’m sorry to hear that Frank. What do you mean sent her back to god?”

“Yeah, cremated her in the furnace, didn’t want to mention it, it was private. Now since you brought me her tag, I guess the cats out of the bag or the dogs out of the furnace.”

He laughed sadly again.

“I couldn’t help noticing, but the…” Frank chuckled softly and interrupted me.

“That’s my wife. She went missing last year… the police think she may have wandered off into the woods and froze to death. Never found her though.”

“I’m so sorry to hear that again Frank.” “It’s alright, she wasn’t herself anymore. Dementia got her. Muttering and talking to herself at the end. That wasn’t my wife, it was a husk with a survival instinct. I’m sorry to dump all this on you kiddo. I’ll let you get back to work.”

He took the dog tag, put it in his pocket and walked away.

I walked back to the furnace. The sun was almost setting.

“Huh, must’ve been a longer chat than I thought.”

Mini was covered in soot.

“Hey Mini, are you running for office with that face?”

“No.” He said curtly

“What’s wrong buddy?”

“I just want this job to be done. I want to go home.”

I looked into the furnace. It was spotless. And right in the middle was the hatch for the thermal reset. I saw how Johnny fixed it. “Damn, he just cut that hatch off and put a piece of sheet metal over it with some self-tapping screws.”

I grabbed my drill, pulled out the screws and there it was. The thermal reset switch. “Mini, grab me a set of needle nose pliers.” The switch was held in with a snap ring. Mini handed me the pliers.

“That was easy. Got the new one?”

“Here.”

And with that, it was in.

“Mini, grab me a flashlight, it's getting dark.” As he did that I started grabbing some firewood and fire started from the wood shed.

“Mini, fill it about a quarter way and light it. I’ll go fire on the pumps inside.”

Mini nodded.

As I walked to the house I started feeling cold.

“Huh, didn’t think that walk was very long. Must’ve been my imagination.”

Mini was sitting in the van writing up the bill. I walked up and knocked on his window.

“Don’t fucking creep up and scare me like that, you’ve done that four times already.”

“I think you're going crazy buddy, here I’ll take the bill and tell Frank he’s all good.”

I turned around and saw the furnace door open with a violent orange glow emanating from inside. I saw a shadow in front of the door. I saw the shadow climb into the inviting glow.

*And close the door.*

I shouted

“FRANK!”

I ran to the furnace. I threw open the door. The fire had gone out. Sitting on the hatch I had just opened was a simple gold wedding band with F & B in cursive script. I grabbed it instinctually.

It was ice cold.

I work at a coffee shop and started about a month ago. My boyfriend (35 M) told me that he was excited to visit me “all the time”. I asked him to wait a few weeks to visit as I was learning the ropes and getting accustomed to the job. He visited me this week and it was sweet to see him. He loved the food, but he did stare at me the entire time he was eating in. My coworkers jokingly said “oooh” as I was walking back from saying goodbye to him. My next shift he asked if I wanted him to come visit. I told him no and he got really upset. We have been arguing on and off about it and I’m honestly unsure if I’m the weird one. Some relevant context is that I used to be a server and had to talk to him about coming in a few times a week. I told him I didn’t want my boss to say anything and that I was busy working. My perspective: I’m new and don’t want to be labeled as “weird” for having my significant other constantly around. We can’t hangout, I’m working. I don’t want it to ever be an issue where it needs to be addressed with my boss. His perspective: he feels like I don’t want to see him or am embarrassed. AITA?",8,1752452935.0,AITAH,26,0.9,False

1lz8di3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Joplumber/comments/1lz8di3/bob_the_boilermaker/,Bob the Boilermaker,"Years before Mini and I went to Franks, I had another strange day. Well, I guess the day wasn’t strange, but the story I was told was. 

The day started like it always does for me. I was speeding to work because my morning shit took a little longer than I expected. 

“Fucking coffee. I have to quit buying the cheap shit. Eh, what does it matter, good shit does the same thing.” 

I hopped in my truck and sped to work like always. I arrived and to my surprise, Bill was sitting at Lou’s desk. 

“You kill your brother or something? Or is he wearing your skin?”

“No Jo, this used to be my office, you know.” 

I didn’t know that. Bill’s office is across the shop as far away as he can be from his Brother. He’s been there since before I was ever here. 

“Feeling nostalgic are we?” 

“Feeling like you want to work on the crackhouse job do you?” 

“Oh fuck off Bill, you know I’m getting sent there after Andreas is done fucking it up.” 

“Yes, yes, I know. If I had an excuse to fire the bastard I would.” 

“But Trent?” 

“Yes, Trent. He gets a little touchy about his little brother. I think he’d leave if I fired him.” 

“Then you’re stuck with Me, George, Bob and Chris. Well, Darryl too but he’s just a labourer.” 

“Bob and Chris I can handle. You and George, you already know how I feel about that.” 

“You love us like we’re your sons and when you die we will inherit everything you own.”

“Sure.”

“Really?!”

“No”

I look at old Bill with my saddest puppy dog eyes. 

“Do you want me to fire you?” 

“I mean kinda, it’d be a big severance package. I could pay off all my gambling debt.” 

“I’d have cause.” 

“Yea, yea. So why are you at Lou’s desk and why isn’t Lou here? His truck wasn’t outside.” 

“He’s had a problem and he’s dealing with it, he’ll be gone for a few days and I’m running his department and my department while he’s gone.”

“Pft. Bob runs your side, you drink coffee all day, sorry I mean sit in meetings.” 

“You’re lucky I like your family kid. If your mom didn’t play on my softball team and I didn’t grow up with your dad…”

“You’d still treat me like I was your long-lost son?”

“Yes.”

“Really?!”

“No. Go see Bob and make me some money.” 

And with that, I walked through the shop exchanging my pleasantries with the heating guys as I went. 

“Johnny boy, how’s it shaking you sexy fuck?”

“Good and you buddy!” 

“Living the dream!”

“Yours or someone else’s?” 

I laughed as I walked into the yard and then into our shop. Bill and Lou recently built it with large hangar doors to bring our vans in to load and unload them. That was probably the smartest thing Lou’s ever done. That stubborn fucker wouldn't even fix my van if the clock breaks. There’s a man door in between the two hangar doors that leads into a long hallway, it’s about 20 meters with steel shelving stacked floor to ceiling with parts all along the hallway. The garage cost a fortune to build but it was worth every penny to those guys. 

I walked down the hallway to the job board beside Bob's office. It’s just a whiteboard with all of our names and large-scale ongoing jobs listed on it. It would go your name, followed by what job you were doing that day. Trent and Chris were doing the hospital job again today. George and the Turd we’re going to do a kitchen renovation. Andreas and Darryl were going to the crackhouse job again. And I was with Bob. 

“Hey Bob, why am I with you?” 

“Good question my boy. Bill told me he wanted me out on the tools while Lou was gone. I figured he would want some more help in the office but he says Candy and him should have it covered.” 

“So where are we going, you haven’t put a job beside our names.” 

Before Bob could answer a high pitch squeal hit our eardrums and Lou the Turd came sprinting in on all fours and slammed head-first into a wall. He knocked himself out. 

“George, take him with you before he breaks his neck again,” said Bob.

Grumbling in Portuguese George walked over to the Turd. Grabbed his head with one hand, threw him over his shoulder and walked to his van parked in the hangar. 

“Before we were so rudely interrupted, you and I 
get to handle some repairs today.” 

“Bob, I’m not an apprentice anymore, I don’t think I need your help to do these repairs. We can get more done separately.” 

We’re constantly behind on service orders. A crew or two extra can always help. 

“Not when we have to do a two-person job. I’ll have you running lead anyways. I never liked telling hotheads what to do.” 

“Ironic coming from you.” 

“I said I didn’t like it, I never said I couldn’t.” 

“So where are we going Bob?” 

“Sue Spiez place. Her husband was playing with the kitchen tap and now it doesn’t work right.”

“Two person job eh?” 

“You fix the tap, I’ll work on Sue.” 

He winked. I gagged at the thought of old Sue, toothless Sue we used to call her in high school, with ol Bobby. 

“Won’t your wrinkles get caught on each other?” 

“I was planning on it.” 

And with that gross image in my head, ol Bobby and I headed to the hangar. 

“Your van or mine?” I asked. 

“Take yours, you’ll be doing all the work today anyways.” 

“Ah just like Starsky and Hutch, except I’m the slave and you're a lazy old fart, and we aren’t buddy cops.” 

“I like that Ol Bobby and Jo, out on an adventure like Gandalf and Bilbo.” 

“Fucking Nerd.” 

We hopped in the van and left for Sue's. On the way, Bob turns the music down. 

“Hey Kid, have I ever told you about The Plant?”

“You? Never. I read the articles about what happened when I grew up. Never really thought about it since. Does this have anything to do with why we’re working together today?” 

“Well, Bill walked into my office this morning with a set of plans, a bid sheet and material takeoff sheets. That only means one thing. We’ve got a big contract coming up and Bill isn’t sure how much to charge.” 

“Bill? Not know how to charge? The guys my grandpa's age. He’s been pricing since he was my age. He doesn’t know what to charge. I’m sorry to say this Bob, but you do?”

“Bill’s only done this twice before. Both times his price came in significantly lower than the actual amount it cost to do the job.” 

“What jobs?”

“Laz Healthcare and the Old St. Andrew Inn.”

“I ran both of those jobs. Laz Healthcare was my first I ran without you two checking over my shoulder every 5 minutes.” 

“And you did a good job. Bill didn’t expect you to encounter problems. However, I did.” 

“And the Old St. Andrew Inn?”

“It has a history us old farts like to forget.”

“That job went way smoother than Laz Healthcare, did we lose on it?” 

“Yeah it went smooth, but magically the economy took a severe hit when we did that job.”

“I remember, Lou almost laid us all off then.” 

“He didn't because of that job. We priced it high. Really high. Bill wanted to charge them half of what we ended up billing. I said no, and the company survived.” 

“I don't like to remember that time.”

“I don't either, So when Bill walked into my office this morning and handed me the plans, I knew it was serious.”

“You brought up The Plant, that's not the job is it?” 

“It is. Though they'll have a tough time convincing the city council to let them open back up.” 

“Well we're here. Better see what your girlfriends husband broke.” 

Bob chuckled as we went inside. The job was simple. Sue's husband is a moron and put the new parts in backwards. Within about 5 minutes we were done and had the bill signed. 

“That was easy.” 

“She's real easy.” 

“Seriously Bob.”

“I almost took that woman on a second date 25 years ago.” 

“I don't want to know. Where are we going next?” 

“Greg Fischer’s, he hasn't got much heat up in his bedroom.”

“Job for the heating boys, no?”

“Simple one for me and you I reckon.” 

We headed across town to Greg’s. 

“So you were saying about The Plant?”

“You know I used to work there before it shut down right?” 

“Of course, you told me a hundred times when you first started here.”

“Good, you remember. Do you remember anything else?”

“Not really, you were vague about your job there and you never mentioned what happened to The Plant. I've only ever read about the accident in the news.” 

“Well kid, I have a feeling Bill is going to have you run lead on this one again. And I also have a feeling I won't be around here when you start the job.” 

“What do you mean you think you'll be gone? Sounds like we’ll start in a few months.”

“No boy, it wont. It'll be almost a decade until you see the inside of The Plant.” 

“How do you know that?”

“Same way I know when Bill’s in a bind and he needs me. I just know. After we’re done at Greg’s we’ll take our lunch.” 

“Bob, it's 9:30 in the morning. He’s probably got a closed valve or something. We’ll be in and out in an hour tops.” 

3 hours later, I was covered in dust and soaking wet. 

“Lunchtime?”

“Yes boy, it’s lunchtime. We’ll take a long one.” 

As we drove to pick up some lunch, Bob started talking.

“You better listen to me boy, stay away from The Plant.”

He continued talking and I patiently listened all the way to lunch, and until then end of the day. We didn't do any jobs after lunch. 

**Bob**

I woke up with a feeling that today wasn’t like any other day at The Plant. I drove to my brother's house to pick him up for our shift. 

“Fred get in the truck!.” 

“Fuck Bob, just because I missed a few meetings doesn't mean you can treat me like a dog.” 

“Freddy, I wouldn't be driving you if you went to the damn meetings.” 

We have the same conversation every morning. We bullshit all the way to The Plant for our shift. 

“Hey Bob, you think Jerry’s gonna be in today? Said his wife was expecting anytime.” 

“He’ll be in, he's always in. Can't afford not to be.” 

“It’ll be a shitty day for us if she does go into labour today,” Brian, head of the maintenance department, said as he walked in. 

Brian was a decade or two younger than me, but he was good at his job. Only guy who could ever keep up as an apprentice.

“How are you liking the new title?” I said. 

“Mom and Dad were really proud, but they said I still had to help out around the farm.” 

“How’s Frank doing now?” said Fred 

“Better since he was going to the meetings. He was asking if you were coming tonight.”

Before Fred had a chance to speak, I said.

“He’ll be there.”

As Fred shot me a look, Jerry walked in. 

“You showed up, figured you'd be home with your wife,” Brian said.

“She said she'd hold him in until I got there.” 

“What’s his name going to be,” I said with a bit of curiosity.

“We're stuck between Jerry Jr. or Zeke. If I had it my way I'd name him Zeke, but she insists on Jerry Jr. Only a miracle would change her mind.” 

“Speaking of miracles, the head office just told me the night shift noticed The Plant’s boiler isn’t outputting the heat it should. They say it's running too cold. They say we have to get it back up to temp.” 

“Did Randy try to get it back up to temp last night?” Jerry asked. 

“Randy wasn’t in last night, didn’t call to let us know either. Just didn’t show up,” said Brian. 

Randy is the night shift maintenance guy. He used to work during the day with Fred and I before Jerry and Brian had jobs here. He was an alright maintenance guy. Better at the piping jobs we did than the maintenance jobs we usually do. He used to work at a local plumbing and heating company. Lou’s Plumbing and Heating Co., he worked with his brothers Bill and Lou. That was until the old man croaked and Lou and Bill found that Randy wasn't in the will. Randy left the company immediately. He has been at The Plant ever since. 

“That isn't like Randy to no show,” I said. 

“You're right, it isn't, I called his wife this morning to see where he was. Said he left for work like usual last night and hasn't been home since. She was real worried,” said Brian. 

“Probably just got drunk and lost his keys,” said Fred.

“You’d be the guy to know,” I said 

Fred glared at me.

“Anyway guys, we can't do anything about Randy, but we can get the boiler operational for the day,” Brian said. 

We walked out of the break room and into The Plant’s main mechanical hall. It was a thing of beauty. Miles of pipework, pumps the size of houses and right smack dab in the centre suspended from the ceiling was a 12-story behemoth of a boiler. It was the main unit for the entire Plant. It did one simple job, make steam. If it couldn’t get hot enough to make steam, we were called to fix it. 

“Alright guys, it’s probably the fire tubes,” Brian said. 

“It’s always the fucking tubes,” Fred complained. 

“Well since you’re volunteering Fred, you and I can go shut it down half way and the two of you can go grab the cleaning agents.”

As we left Brian and Fred to shut down half of the boiler, Jerry spoke. 

“We’re gonna be here all night cleaning that fucking thing.”

“I have a feeling we’ll be done sooner than you think.” 

We found the cleaning agents in a small room off the mechanical hall. We loaded the barrels on to some pallets and trucked them over on a pallet jack. 

When we got back, Brian and Fred were opening the first 33 tubes on this half of the boiler. They were 1 metre in diameter and 20 metres long. As per the Angel Fire 66-F manual, the tubes can be entered through the firebox box and exited through the chimney. Each tube is to be cleaned with a special swab that is soaked in a special cleaning solution designed for use with this boiler. Angel Fire HW Boiler Colloid. A rope is manually pulled through the tube and the rope is pulled through the middle of the swab. 30 of the tubes are able to be done 2 at a time the. The swab gets pulled through a second tube by running the rope through the tube above. The final 3 are done individually as the run at the bottom of the boiler. The rope is pulled over head under the boiler to pull the swab through. 

“Grab me the marshmallows, let’s get these fuckers done,” said Fred 

Jerry being the smallest would pull the ropes through the tubes. Brian and Fred would pull the marshmallows through and I’d soak the next marshmallow with the glorified vinegar solution we pay an arm and a leg for. 

“We’re making good time,” said Brian. 

“At this rate we’ll be home for supper,” said Jerry.

We were about done with the first 33 by lunch. We took our break for lunch. After 30 minutes we got back to work. We had the first side fired and saw the temps rising. Hot but not hot enough. 

“Guess we aren’t that lucky,” said Brian. 

We shutdown the other half of the boiler and started on the last 33. By quitting time we only had the 3 tubes at the bottom of the boiler to do. 

“Well do you guys wanna go home and pick this up tomorrow?” asked Brian.

“I could use the overtime,” said Jerry.

“Well I guess you’re gonna need some help,” I said. 

“It’s either this or AA and my chauffeur isn’t leaving so I guess I’m not either,” said Fred. 

The Plant gets really busy around shift change. Sounds get louder and more mistakes are made at shift change than any other time at The Plant.

“Well an hour or two of double bubble, and then I have a bottle of whiskey waiting for me at home,” said Fred. 

“Let’s get too it then,” I said.

Jerry pulled the rope through the first tube and then the second, on the last one he encountered a problem.

“Hey guys! You didn’t open the end of the tube!” yelled Jerry. 

Confused, I looked up from the last swab I was soaking. I glanced at the tube Jerry was in and then at the two bodies lying unconscious underneath it. I heard a click I’ve heard hundreds of times before. The gas valve was opening. 

“JERRY GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE NOW!”

I watched the gas light, it incinerated Jerry. And then I watched what happens to 100 tons of steel when you heat it up to half of the surface of the sun. I watched my brother, and my friend be encased in molten steel. Then the side filled with water had a hole melted into it. 

I ran. 

They said we didn’t take safety seriously. They said someone made a mistake on shift change. They said there was no foul play. They said I was crazy. They said Randy hung himself. They said… 

*They said*

Never go to The Plant.

“Simple one for me and you I reckon.” 

We headed across town to Greg’s. 

“So you were saying about The Plant?”

“You know I used to work there before it shut down right?” 

“Of course, you told me a hundred times when you first started here.”

“Good, you remember. Do you remember anything else?”

“Not really, you were vague about your job there and you never mentioned what happened to The Plant. I've only ever read about the accident in the news.” 

“Well kid, I have a feeling Bill is going to have you run lead on this one again. And I also have a feeling I won't be around here when you start the job.” 

“What do you mean you think you'll be gone? Sounds like we’ll start in a few months.”

“No boy, it wont. It'll be almost a decade until you see the inside of The Plant.” 

“How do you know that?”

“Same way I know when Bill’s in a bind and he needs me. I just know. After we’re done at Greg’s we’ll take our lunch.” 

“Bob, it's 9:30 in the morning. He’s probably got a closed valve or something. We’ll be in and out in an hour tops.” 

3 hours later, I was covered in dust and soaking wet. 

“Lunchtime?”

“Yes boy, it’s lunchtime. We’ll take a long one.” 

As we drove to pick up some lunch, Bob started talking.

“You better listen to me boy, stay away from The Plant.”

He continued talking and I patiently listened all the way to lunch, and until then end of the day. We didn't do any jobs after lunch. 

**Bob**

I woke up with a feeling that today wasn’t like any other day at The Plant. I drove to my brother's house to pick him up for our shift. 

“Fred get in the truck!.” 

“Fuck Bob, just because I missed a few meetings doesn't mean you can treat me like a dog.” 

“Freddy, I wouldn't be driving you if you went to the damn meetings.” 

We have the same conversation every morning. We bullshit all the way to The Plant for our shift. 

“Hey Bob, you think Jerry’s gonna be in today? Said his wife was expecting anytime.” 

“He’ll be in, he's always in. Can't afford not to be.” 

“It’ll be a shitty day for us if she does go into labour today,” Brian, head of the maintenance department, said as he walked in. 

Brian was a decade or two younger than me, but he was good at his job. Only guy who could ever keep up as an apprentice.

“How are you liking the new title?” I said. 

“Mom and Dad were really proud, but they said I still had to help out around the farm.” 

“How’s Frank doing now?” said Fred 

“Better since he was going to the meetings. He was asking if you were coming tonight.”

Before Fred had a chance to speak, I said.

“He’ll be there.”

As Fred shot me a look, Jerry walked in. 

“You showed up, figured you'd be home with your wife,” Brian said.

“She said she'd hold him in until I got there.” 

“What’s his name going to be,” I said with a bit of curiosity.

“We're stuck between Jerry Jr. or Zeke. If I had it my way I'd name him Zeke, but she insists on Jerry Jr. Only a miracle would change her mind.” 

“Speaking of miracles, the head office just told me the night shift noticed The Plant’s boiler isn’t outputting the heat it should. They say it's running too cold. They say we have to get it back up to temp.” 

“Did Randy try to get it back up to temp last night?” Jerry asked. 

“Randy wasn’t in last night, didn’t call to let us know either. Just didn’t show up,” said Brian. 

Randy is the night shift maintenance guy. He used to work during the day with Fred and I before Jerry and Brian had jobs here. He was an alright maintenance guy. Better at the piping jobs we did than the maintenance jobs we usually do. He used to work at a local plumbing and heating company. Lou’s Plumbing and Heating Co., he worked with his brothers Bill and Lou. That was until the old man croaked and Lou and Bill found that Randy wasn't in the will. Randy left the company immediately. He has been at The Plant ever since. 

“That isn't like Randy to no show,” I said. 

“You're right, it isn't, I called his wife this morning to see where he was. Said he left for work like usual last night and hasn't been home since. She was real worried,” said Brian. 

“Probably just got drunk and lost his keys,” said Fred.

“You’d be the guy to know,” I said 

Fred glared at me.

“Anyway guys, we can't do anything about Randy, but we can get the boiler operational for the day,” Brian said. 

We walked out of the break room and into The Plant’s main mechanical hall. It was a thing of beauty. Miles of pipework, pumps the size of houses and right smack dab in the centre suspended from the ceiling was a 12-story behemoth of a boiler. It was the main unit for the entire Plant. It did one simple job, make steam. If it couldn’t get hot enough to make steam, we were called to fix it. 

“Alright guys, it’s probably the fire tubes,” Brian said. 

“It’s always the fucking tubes,” Fred complained. 

“Well since you’re volunteering Fred, you and I can go shut it down half way and the two of you can go grab the cleaning agents.”

As we left Brian and Fred to shut down half of the boiler, Jerry spoke. 

“We’re gonna be here all night cleaning that fucking thing.”

“I have a feeling we’ll be done sooner than you think.” 

We found the cleaning agents in a small room off the mechanical hall. We loaded the barrels on to some pallets and trucked them over on a pallet jack. 

When we got back, Brian and Fred were opening the first 33 tubes on this half of the boiler. They were 1 metre in diameter and 20 metres long. As per the Angel Fire 66-F manual, the tubes can be entered through the firebox box and exited through the chimney. Each tube is to be cleaned with a special swab that is soaked in a special cleaning solution designed for use with this boiler. Angel Fire HW Boiler Colloid. A rope is manually pulled through the tube and the rope is pulled through the middle of the swab. 30 of the tubes are able to be done 2 at a time the. The swab gets pulled through a second tube by running the rope through the tube above. The final 3 are done individually as the run at the bottom of the boiler. The rope is pulled over head under the boiler to pull the swab through. 

“Grab me the marshmallows, let’s get these fuckers done,” said Fred 

Jerry being the smallest would pull the ropes through the tubes. Brian and Fred would pull the marshmallows through and I’d soak the next marshmallow with the glorified vinegar solution we pay an arm and a leg for. 

“We’re making good time,” said Brian. 

“At this rate we’ll be home for supper,” said Jerry.

We were about done with the first 33 by lunch. We took our break for lunch. After 30 minutes we got back to work. We had the first side fired and saw the temps rising. Hot but not hot enough. 

“Guess we aren’t that lucky,” said Brian. 

We shutdown the other half of the boiler and started on the last 33. By quitting time we only had the 3 tubes at the bottom of the boiler to do. 

“Well do you guys wanna go home and pick this up tomorrow?” asked Brian.

“I could use the overtime,” said Jerry.

“Well I guess you’re gonna need some help,” I said. 

“It’s either this or AA and my chauffeur isn’t leaving so I guess I’m not either,” said Fred. 

The Plant gets really busy around shift change. Sounds get louder and more mistakes are made at shift change than any other time at The Plant.

“Well an hour or two of double bubble, and then I have a bottle of whiskey waiting for me at home,” said Fred. 

“Let’s get too it then,” I said.

Jerry pulled the rope through the first tube and then the second, on the last one he encountered a problem.

“Hey guys! You didn’t open the end of the tube!” yelled Jerry. 

Confused, I looked up from the last swab I was soaking. I glanced at the tube Jerry was in and then at the two bodies lying unconscious underneath it. I heard a click I’ve heard hundreds of times before. The gas valve was opening. 

“JERRY GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE NOW!”

I watched the gas light, it incinerated Jerry. And then I watched what happens to 100 tons of steel when you heat it up to half of the surface of the sun. I watched my brother, and my friend be encased in molten steel. Then the side filled with water had a hole melted into it. 

I ran. 

They said we didn’t take safety seriously. They said someone made a mistake on shift change. They said there was no foul play. They said I was crazy. They said Randy hung himself. They said… 

*They said*

Never go to The Plant.

1lz8awy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lz8awy,[Reforger][Recruiting] Halo Mil Sim UNSC New Horizon,"Hello I’m MSgt. Coffee NCOIC (non commissioned officer in command) of the Marines branch in an Arma Reforger Halo Mil Sim known as “UNSC New Horizon”. We are a semi serious Mil Sim but focus more on having a good time. We’re a smaller name in a larger pond. We’re trying to recruit more players to come and join our community. We’d like to grow our population to add more organizations to our sim and bring larger scale and more fun experiences. In New Horizon we welcome players of all kinds and we understand that it takes a gathering of people to build a community and that those in charge are merely representatives of the people in that community. If you’re looking for a new Halo Mil Sim to call home or looking for your first unit in the game then UNSC New Horizon is a great fresh start. We welcome all with open arms. We cater to all time zones how ever most of our action takes place during EST for the time being. Come and join UNSC New Horizon today! 

What we offer?

Marines- when you first join the server you automatically fall under the Marine branch. The Marines are our main assault force. This is the starting branch that both the ODST’s and the Spartans recruit from. When you join the server we request you join in as a Marine to start. Upon joining you will be allowed to remain as a guest until you request a Orientation/BCT and upon completion of that you will be a fully vetted member of UNSC New Horizon.

ODST’s- the ODST’s are always feet first into hell and are amongst our elite. Using drop pods for rapid combat insertions they operate as our line breakers and operators behind enemy lines. Boosting the moral of those around them the ODST’s are a light of success 

Spartans- When all else fails they do not! Our Spartans all carry their own unique traits and abilities. They tackle our toughest objectives and when we’re starting to lose they recapture the upper hand in the fight! 

How is rank structured?

We follow rank structure to the organization of USMC. E-1 -> E3 are through time and experience. How long you’ve been in the Mil Sim and how many operations have you been apart of. E-4 is achieved upon completion of our NCOA (non commissioned officer academy) and E-5 -> E-9 is upon selection 

What tactics do we use and how are we structured? 

We combine both U.S. Army and USMC doctrine together. On operations we operate from fire teams to platoons we have 4 man fire teams 3 teams per squad and 4 squads per platoon. Using both air assault tactics and light infantry tactics and on occasion mounted infantry tactics. The ODST’s follow Halo lore drop pod tactics and the Spartans use small unit tactics in conjunction to Halo lore 

What do we want to achieve? 

For the Marines we would like to introduce a Force Recon / MARSOC and a scout sniper platoon and a MAC (Marine Air Command) we are currently running qualifications for them however we’d like to have the population to be able to have them be their own entities. 

We have spartan 2’s and Spartan 3’s and ODST’s that we would like to be able to plus up as well. Later down the line and it’s still being discussed we’d like to introduce an ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) however we won’t be able to achieve that quite yet but with your enlistment to New Horizon we’ll be a step closer! 

We are an ambitious sim looking to bring forth a fun and authentic Halo experience to any and all players. We’re not worried about other sims we just want to present the best experience that we can provide for our community! We look to fully immerse all players of our community as best we can to make them feel as if though they really are in the Halo universe.

1lz894n,https://i.redd.it/e9xrp33qgqcf1.jpeg,"Hey, let's talk about synesthesia and weird associations","I’m a synesthete, and I believe a large part of my synesthesia was shaped by my early school experiences, from preschool all the way to university.

For example, in early primary school (around kindergarten to first grade), we had a set of six colored pencils. Our homework often involved coloring numbered drawings, where each number corresponded to a unique color. I think this is when my first synesthetic experiences started. For a long time, I had a limited but very stable set of number-color associations, and it never changed over the years.

I also remember that we used different colored notebooks for different subjects: Blue for language learning, Red for math, Green for general culture, Yellow for science. Over time, these kinds of structured color-symbol pairings really stuck with me.

Today, here are my strongest and simplest synesthetic associations (I also have synesthetic associations for sounds, smells, temperature, etc., but they’re harder to describe in writing):

* 0 = black = void/null/nil, likely influenced by my background in computer science during undergrad.
* 1 = white, again due to programming logic: like flipping a switch on → light = white = peace/clarity. I  like this color.
* 2 = reddish-brown / maroon, not standard red. I find this number and color really cool and warm.
* 3 = green, like the green of mango leaves. It’s calming. Most of my t-shirts and sweaters are green. I also love nature.
* 4 = blue, like the sky. This is my number and color, my favorite. 90% of my shirts are some shade of blue, and the other 10% are white or black. I dislike striped or dotted clothing and prefer solid colors. Fun fact: I was born on 01/04 (April 1st) black - white - blue.
* 5 = orange, it feels like 6 sometimes, but they are definitely not the same, the orange in 5 is more pronounced, 6 is more yellow.
* 6 = yellow-orange, like the sun. Feels warm. Reminds me of Thursdays in high school, which were often sunny and were also the day we had math exams.
* 7 = brown / coffee
* 8 = standard red
* 9 = violet/purple, though this one is a bit weaker in terms of immediate association.",3,1752452467.0,AutisticWithADHD,2,1.0,False

1lz878f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lz878f/frenemy/,Frenemy,"Warning: Long Post Ahead


So, I have a very good friend that I’ve been forced to distance myself from recently. I don’t know if she’s always been this way and I only recently caught on, or if she’s changed for the worse in the past few months. Anyway, I started to notice that when we’re around other people she lies about the most pointless things. She has also become extremely competitive and is always trying to one up me in any way she can. I’ll list my grievances in bullet point form because I feel like it’s the easiest way to get them off my chest:

•She lies about having certain health conditions 

First it started as “beef dementia.” She would allegedly get confused and anxious after eating beef. Then she started telling everyone it was actually an allergy and her doctor gave her an EpiPen for it because she almost died. She had never been prescribed an EpiPen btw, I can guarantee she wouldn’t even know how to use one. Then she started saying it was actually alpha-gal and she can’t have any red meats… yet she had venison last fall and was perfectly fine. She’s can also tolerate pork and all dairy products.
She goes on this rant every single time we go out to dinner or meet a new person, it is so annoying to listen to.

A few months back, she pinched a nerve in her back. The doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong, so they sent her for an EMG. She told my friends and I that they found out her SI joint is what’s causing the pain and also her nerves are firing faster than normal which further agitates the area. 
Not two days later she tells some *other* friends, “yeah, I got an EMG done. The doctors told me I was born with a genetic disorder that makes my nerves fire super fast, so I’ve got really quick reflexes but it’s not necessarily a good thing.”

•She turned the gym into an unhealthy obsession

I started going to the gym a few years ago and finally convinced her to start going with me. I told her how much I’d enjoyed it and how empowering it was, and after the first few times she became addicted. She would go with me 3 times a week and sometimes ever more than that. She took notice of all my fitness goals and PRs and would try to “beat” me in all of them. If my goal was to be able to do a pull up, she went out of her way to do 3. When I said I wanted to learn how to do a headstand, she practiced every day and would send videos of her doing said headstands to our groupchats. She would also ask me what weights I used for each machine and then make it her goal to lift heavier. 

•She turned reading into a competition

We got back into reading around the same time and started trading books back and forth after a decade of not reading for anything besides school work. I told her I was using good reads to track how many books I finish and set goals for myself. Not long after, she made reading her whole personality. She would read all day every day and brag about how many books she’s finished. Then she started reaching out to other people and joining book clubs, attending book swaps, got a bookish tattoo, and even ended up on a mutual friend’s bookish podcast as a guest host for one episode… her episode was “all about main character energy.”

•She tries to out-do me in the kitchen 

I recently started bringing dishes to our friend and family get togethers, and everyone is a big fan of pretty much anything I make. They call me the “chili queen,” ask for my mac & cheese at every event, rave over my loaded baked potato salad. Her husband even requested that I make him a birthday cake, despite him not liking sweets very much. I made him a German Chocolate cake and everyone loved it; there were no leftovers and he told me afterward that he’d never even had a homemade cake before aside from boxed mixes. Well, this must have struck a chord with my friend because she started recording and posting all of the dinners she cooked from then on. They don’t look that great, but she’s very theatrical with her videos so some people enjoy watching them. She gets about 30 likes per video. Anyway, get this: 
One night we’re having a movie night with some mutuals. My friend starts talking about how the previous night she stopped at a gas station to grab a premade iced coffee drink. She tells everyone, “so I go in and grab one of the coffees from the cooler section, and this lady I’ve never met before said ‘you’re not gonna make that from scratch like everything else?’” The friend then says, “I don’t really know how I feel about strangers recognizing me in public, it’s kind of crazy.” Cue the feigned timid demeanor and a coy hair tuck 🙄

•She started writing a book after I told her I felt confident I could write one

I read a pretty crappy novel and told her “wow, if this book can get published I could literally get rich writing my own.” I always wanted to write a book and growing up every teacher I had told me I’d make a great author- it’s something I prided myself in. Well, this friend ran with that idea and started writing her own novel. She’s admitted to using chatgpt a lot, and at this point it’s even leaking into her own facebook posts. They all sound like they were written by AI. Thats neither here no there, so moving on… she’s also been pretending that she has all these people supporting her dream to be an author. It sucks because subconsciously I fall into the trap of wondering, “why am I not getting that kind of support?” 
Ex.
-She told me and several of our friends that her husband booked her a surprise photoshoot; that he wanted her to have nice headshots for when she gets published some day. Very sweet, right? 
Except the day of the photoshoot her husband asked mine, “Where is she going again? What are the pictures for?”
Keep in mind we’re in our mid-20s so it’s not he’s suffering from Alzheimer’s or any kind of memory limiting disorder.

-Around Christmas time, she asked her former boss if he might be willing to hire her back in a part-time position because she hated her current job (she’s a secretary at a smaller school and never leaves the desk, it’s fairly low stress). She would want to work at his company 3 days a week instead of 5 and was requesting to keep the same rate of pay that she was getting at the school. He took a few months to consider it, then told her he thinks it’s doable and he’d hire her on in the fall.
This is wonderful for her, but she started telling all of our friends that “the offer came out of nowhere! I was one of his best employees and he wants me back. He also knows I’m writing a book and wants me to have more free time to work on my career as an author!” 


•She lies about her job duties 

I have an extremely stressful job and this friend knows it. I’m an operations manager for a well known retail pharmacy. Our store does close to 800 scripts a day and I manage a team of about a dozen technicians, it’s physically and mentally draining. I’m in charge of the hiring, training, coaching, firing, yearly performance reviews, scheduling, daily task completion, inventory, customer complaints, etc.
One weekend, a few of my friends and I decided to get together for another movie night. We were planning on watching the second LOTR. As we were setting stuff up, this friend was telling the others about something that happened to her in the office. 
“So I was sitting at my desk, listening to shire music from the LOTR soundtrack, when this girl comes into the main office. I was in charge of doing her interview and she heard the shire music— instantly she was like ‘omg, are we gonna be best friends?’” 
But the funny thing is this friend has never and WILL never do interviews. It’s just not part of her job description or her scope of practice. She’s not a manager in any way. The lie was slipped in there so discretely, but why lie in the first place?? It was so unnecessary.

•TW: Comparing our pregnancy losses

She miscarried last January, and I miscarried in November. She had already told me all the specifics of her loss and I was there to help her in any way when it happened. When I suffered my own loss, she started to change her story. Suddenly she didn’t miscarry at 9 weeks like she originally told me, she was 12 weeks. Further along than I had been at the time of my loss. 
I told her how I began to miscarry at work and had to clean my blood off of the bathroom floor then go back like everything was fine. I told her how it was traumatic for me and it’s so wrong that I felt the need to stay and work through something like that. As fate would have it, she also had to clean her blood off the bathroom floor at work while she miscarried, so she totally understood where I was coming from………… another new detail she never mentioned before. 


Okay, so that’s my rant, but now comes the hard part. This friend has been a big part of my life the past few years. She and her husband were the MOH/BM in our wedding last fall. We’ve done countless things together, supported each other when we needed it most, and know exactly what the other is thinking half the time. Our friend group is extremely close-knit so it’s hard to avoid her unless I isolate myself from everyone else. I want things to go back to the way that they were, but I’m not sure if that can happen. Whenever we spend time together as a group I have to stop myself from rolling my eyes at her tall tales, and I’m sure she can sense my irritation. This makes me feel guilty bc maybe she’s only doing these things to win my praise and attention, or maybe she’s hoping it will help us bond?  I don’t think I want to break things off, but it all just feels so toxic and manipulative and I don’t know what to do.
 

TLDR: Very close friend has become competitive with me and lies for attention. Don’t know what to do moving forward.",2,1752452312.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I moved 1200 miles from home after a divorce and my long distance relationship wasn’t working out. My question is how can people our age meet people.

1lz857w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Middle_Eye882/comments/1lz857w/bitter_fruit_part_2/,Bitter Fruit: Part 2,"2



*-6am*

I needed to use the water closet and fixed myself a coffee downstairs. I am perplexed by how odd it tastes. The bitterness is greater than before. Not even the sugar is making it better. 

Will discuss later. Must finish my account of last night. 

	

After supper, we were summoned to the drawing room, which I now saw had a roaring fireplace. At the center of the coffee table, I saw the surprise the Doctor was talking about. A large thin device of metal with what looked like a glass bowl for its base stood proudly and bewildered me with its ornaments. A long, tasseled leather hose stuck from its side and clay bowl wrapped in what looked like foil sat on top. There were hot coals from the fireplace atop that, and I realized that the base was filled with water. Before I could figure out its function, the doctor took the hose and inhaled. The base bubbled and like a magician, Weber produced a smoke ring out of thin air. I was sure I’d seen this before in a book somewhere, but was unsure exactly where. 

“A hookah!” exclaimed the professor. “I’ve never seen one in person before.”

“Not very common here in the states,” he said with a smile. “This, like the wine, is simply another one of my spoils of travel. Sit, if you please. I intend to share.” 

He handed the hose to the doctor who took it happily and puffed. He tried a smoke ring of his own, but to no avail. Then, he tried to hand it to me. I declined, but I do remember thinking the vapor smelled lovely. It was strange how tempting it was to me, considering I’m intolerant to tobacco on my best days- it always makes me sick. 

“Not even a try, Herr Manuel?” asked the Doctor. “I assure you its quite sweet.” 

“No,” I told him. “Thank you, but I’m fine.”  He offered me a cigar or pipe from his collection, but once more I insisted. Finally, with what I can only describe as a look of disappointment mixed with admiration, he grinned and moved on. 

He began to tell us about his time as an archeologist in Crete. Apparently he wrote several papers on the Minoan Language which has yet to be translated, though he assured us, he was closer than most. Crete is also where he bought the hookah, and he told us every detail- no matter how exhausting- about how difficult it was to transport. 

He also told us of his collection of books and the lengths he’d struggled to obtain some of them. I went on to ask him what his rarest book was, but he seemed hesitant to answer. 

“Rarity is a hard thing to measure, as with some of these copies, I don’t have a confirmed number on how many were ever made.”

“Then which one do you think, if any, do you have the only copy of.”

He fiddled with his bowtie as his face almost seemed to reach for an expression to disarm me. That same smile of his greeted me as he promised, “Tomorrow. Tomorrow, I will show you, if you still desire, the rarest book I own.”

With that, Maxwell changed the topic. He was in noticeably better spirits than he’d been in the dining room and his face wasn’t even rosy from the crying. He mentioned how our own journey had gone and how strange the townsfolk of Portley had been to us. He brushed off the report with a wave of his hand.

“Yes, yes,” he said. “They’re quite new here and still learning. I’m sure they’ll be much nicer once you depart. They don’t get too many visitors, and I am their only doctor. I’m half surprised they don’t have an accent like mine given how often I interact with them!” He laughed at that, as did Maxwell, whose mind was already content with the answer. However, my mind was still chewing on that first sentence.

They’re “new,” and “still learning,” were not explanations I expected to hear. What does that even mean? I’m still bothered by it now. 

They continued to puff on the hookah until eventually, the doctor stood up and walked over to the fire. He was framed by the Greek moldings and victorian hearth that was only visible through the yellow filter of gaslight.  

“I suppose you are still curious about supper. Or, more specifically, what supper did to you. Am I correct?”	We both nodded, and he smirked. Pushing up his glasses in an almost theatrical fashion he spoke:

“I have a confession to make, my friends. I have not been completely up front with you about the full extent of my promise. Maxwell, I recall in my letter I said that the plant I had developed could change the shape of history? That it could rescue those starving in the hoovervilles and save the farmer from ruin?” Maxwell nodded eagerly, like a child to his sunday-school teacher. Weber strolled over and took the hookah hose from him. He took a long puff and blew several smoke rings into the chandelier above us. The vapor looked like passing ghosts from where I sat. Weber took another deep, laboring breath. 

“Fifteen years ago, this would have been impossible for me. I suffered, my young friends, from tuberculosis of the lungs. Every handkerchief I owned was flecked with crimson, and every movement I made was done through great pain.” He puffed again on the hookah. “You probably wonder why it is then that I can do such things. Why can I indulge such pleasures? I tell you now it is because of my discovery.” 

He pulled something round from his jacket pocket, about the size of a tennis ball. It was a weird flesh toned color, though what hue exactly was hard to tell in the amber light of the room. It was then I noticed just how impossibly smooth and round it was. It sat balanced, despite having no base, but did have one spot where it sank. A small green stem with a jagged leaf sprouted from its top. 

“Behold,” the doctor said, gesturing to the professor to touch it, “the Eden Fruit.” 

Maxwell picked it up and studied it, examining it as tenderly as a golden egg. I was mesmerized by the thing, but with a little more concern. It was such an odd looking fruit. 

“You see,” Weber said, “I’m an archeologist by trade, but with my worsening condition, I realized I need to turn to something less dusty and likely to make me cough, lest my death fall upon me like a viper. I turned to science. I looked for cures in chemistry, but found nothing. I looked into anatomy, searching for something to cut or scrape out, and still my efforts were in vain. I decided then, if not in medicines or surgeries, perhaps a cure could be derived from a more…. *Natural* source.” He pointed at the fruit in Maxwell’s hands. “After cross pollinating countless times, studying the effects of different herbs on the body, and after thousands of unsuccessful grafts, this is the result of my labors.” 

He walked over slowly and gently plucked the fruit from Maxwell’s hand. He then jerked his face toward me and extended the thing my way. 

“I insist you try it.” 

There was  something in the way he said it that almost made me shudder. He noticed.

“No?” he asked. “It’s perfectly safe. See?” He took a bite of the pink flesh himself and ripped a chunk away. What remained in its place was a large hole that revealed an interior so scarlet, I thought blood would ooze from it. It was like some demonic apple, and yet Weber appeared to savor it like it was the sweetest chocolate he’d ever tasted. He offered it to me again, but I still couldn’t do it. He merely shrugged at my denial and tossed it back to Maxwell, who barely hesitated to take a bite. He chewed for a moment before staring at it in wonder. 

“Peaches?” he wondered. “But sweeter, somehow?”

“Funny,” Weber replied, “I normally get bananas or figs.” He took a seat in an armchair closest to the fire. “Through much effort and experimentation, I have made the flavor malleable. It will take on the flavor a person merely wants it to have. For instance, if you bite it expecting fruit, you will most likely taste your favorite one. Is yours peaches, Maxwell?” 

The  professor nodded. 

“Excellent. It works a charm, even now in its fifth generation.” Before I could raise the question, he cut me off. “Over fifteen years, I have produced four other variants of this fruit. I am happy to say this is the strongest one. It not only can take the flavors of desired fruit, but also of other substances.” He looked at me. “Stew, per se.”

If I’d been able to throw up, I would have then. Being fed such a thing without my permission was one thing, but the illusion of its flavor and consistency unnerved me. I stared in wide eyed horror while the professor was clearly filled with amazement. 

“I apologize for the deception,” Weber said, raising an apologetic hand my way, “but I felt it was the easiest way to make you believe me. Thankfully I am a decent cook and you seemed none the wiser.”

“That’s completely unethical,” I told him. “What if we’d been allergic? Magic fruit or stew or whatever you want to call all of this… What if we’d died?”

“Oh, Herr Manuel,” he said, stroking his mustache. “You would not die from this. On the contrary. Look what wonders it has done for your body.”

I touched my throat as Maxwell burst out:

“You mean to say that this fruit-”

“Yes, professor, I do.” He gestured at the fruit with the hookah hose. “The same fruit that cured me of my tuberculosis is the same remedy that fixed Manuel’s aches and soothed your poor heart from despair.”

My blood ran cold as he said these things. Maxwell’s face finally looked more like mine than that of a gullible child, but there was still no suspicion. He tugged at the fringe of his beard as he rolled the fruit around in his hand. 

“How is any of this possible?” my mentor asked. I expected a sharp reply, but instead, there was a beat of thought. Weber stood to his feet at the fireplace crackled behind him and he licked his dry lips. 

“I fear I have overloaded your poor brains with too much information for one night,” he said. “I apologize for this. We may dive into the science of it all tomorrow, but for now, both of you need rest. Please, I’ll clean up once we’ve settled you in. No protest, now. I insist. If I continue to explain myself, you shall be a puddle of mush by morning. No, no. After breakfast I will take you to the orchard. For now, sleep awaits you. Gentlemen, please follow me.”

With that, he insisted Maxwell finish the fruit and he produced another one for myself from some pocket I couldn’t discern. He encouraged me to do the same when I preferred, insisting I would prefer eventually. 

With that, we were led to our bedrooms and given keys to our doors. He instructed us where the bathrooms were and where his bedroom was should we need him. Finally, he told us something that in my exhaustion I didn’t quite catch or understand, but now reflecting on it all, still startles me. 

“Please don’t go outside,” he said. “In places like this, with the shadows and the treeline as close as they are, the dark may play tricks on you. The wind may howl and your tired minds may get the better of you, but don’t fool yourself. Stay inside at night at all times, and don’t venture out without telling me.”

With that he shook our hands and bid us good night, though I struggled to sleep. For whatever reason, I’m still thinking of Marie. Perhaps it was because of the doctor’s wild story of tuberculosis- however untrue it may be. Or maybe its the crazier dream I can’t help having. If this fruit is all it’s made out to be, and all its properties are as Weber described, could it have helped you, Marie? My mother?	

A strange thing happens as I write this. I find that the more I ache for you, Marie, the more I crave this devil-fruit on my desk. I don’t think it can help, but then again, I remember Maxwell. I am distraught at my own circumstances.



*-7am*

I took a bite. It tasted like strawberries. Those were always your favorite. Chest more relaxed. Head more clear. Heart still broken. 



*-**~~12:15 pm~~*

~~Imposimble~~



\-*2pm*

I feel that I need to control myself as I write because I fear my excitement may not allow for a clear explanation. I feel like I’m dreaming and if I don’t have this journal to look back on and keep my facts straight, I fear my story will get me locked away in some institution. It's the facts I need to focus on. The facts, Marie. Facts.

Here they are:

After my entry from this morning, I went downstairs once more to return the borrowed coffee cup and found the professor and doctor sitting in the drawing room once again- this time with cigars- discussing all sorts of academic matters. The professor was wearing a cable-knit sweater and his fedora sat comfortably on his crossed knee. The doctor, sitting opposite him on his lavish red velvet couch, was wearing a different shade of tweed and a necktie in place of his bowtie from the night before. It was just as colorful as the bowtie, however, and was adorned in a pattern of Turkish tulips. 

I know that’s what they were because that was exactly the topic they’d moved onto when I walked in. They laughed and slapped each other's shoulders as they talked about one odd encounter after another. Maxwell dropped a stub of ash on his sweater and almost lost his mind laughing. It was as if they were drunk without any of the symptoms of whiskey. 

Eventually, Weber stopped laughing and stood to his feet. He blew the smoke in his mouth into the silver chandelier that hung from a flaking gilded ceiling. Gold fluttered down like snow as the light breeze kissed it. I stared up in curiosity as Weber put a hand on my shoulder and laughed. 

“Forgive the decay of my home, Herr Manuel. The building we stand in was once home to a reclusive Prussian count by the name of Henrich Bastian. He came to this land in the 70s after the unification of my homeland and lived in moderate luxury and great disgrace. Bastian was disliked by chancellor Bismark, you understand, and for good reasons. On a drunken night, Bastian killed an army officer in the courtyard of a nobleman's house- one favored greatly by the army and deeply loved by one of Bismark’s cousins-'' He raised a hand to stop himself. 

“I ramble. The point of the matter is this: He fled the hangman’s rope on the first boat he could with as much gold and as many heirlooms as he could pack and built this manor in the middle of Georgia. You could say his sin- our murderous Cain, if you will- is what gives us such a lavish home in such a wilderness. Remnants of the man and his small family are everywhere. There! See? I keep a photo of him and his son next to the stairs.”

In the pale morning light that now filled the hallway, I did see what he was talking about. In the corner of the stairwell hung a tin-type portrait of a heavily mustached man standing beside a somber-looking woman in dark dress. Beneath them, unsmiling, was a young man no older than sixteen. He looked scared, to a degree, and there was some wetness about his eyes that gave me the impression he was a moment from breaking into tears. 

The professor’s wrinkled finger crept in at the corner of my vision. “The young man in the chair,” he said, “was Joseph Bastian. He was the one whose death secured my inheritance of this place.”

“You were related?” I asked him, a pang of sympathy besieging my heart. The look on his face was pitiful and mournful. 

“*Ja,*” he said, slipping into his mother tongue. “An amazing cultural exchange, it would seem. My mother, American by birth, moved to Germany to be closer to her distant relatives after losing her first husband to the American Civil War. A marriage in Berlin to a lawyer eventually led to me, and I grew up never knowing I had an aunt.” he pointed again. “That is her, next to the count. Frau Jennifer Bastian.” 

He puffed on his cigar as he took a few admiring steps towards the young man pictured. “Joseph- my dear unknown cousin- grew up in a world without me. We never had the chance to lean on each other. When I was in the trenches, facing Russian bullets and fleeing English tanks, I did not have his kind face to think of- for I imagine such a soft soul was kind. We never had the chance to discuss our lives. Never was a drink shared between us or a cigar passed. We never expressed the burdens of our families to each other- our fathers!” His eyes glazed over with haunted memories. “My father was cold, true. The count, however, was a hot-head and a drinker. How many bruises, I wonder, are hidden in such a portrait? Do I dare think of it?” He paused, as if actually considering the question, then sighed. “Indeed, I cannot help it.” 

I searched for a word to say, but was beaten by the professor. “How did the young man die, Doctor Weber?”

He kept his back to us in silence for several moments as cigar smoke rose from his tightened fist. 

“They say suicide,” he told us in a surprisingly quaint tone, “but I disagree. I believe it murder- even if not direct.” His gaze seemed to shift ever so slightly to the man standing above young Joseph. His fiery dead stare matched the doctor’s icy gaze. “If *Graf* Bastain is Cain, then young Joseph is Able…”

I almost went to comfort him when he spun around and tossed a hand over his shoulder, “That said, gentlemen, you did not come to hear of my family history, nor of murderous deeds and dead relatives. Come!” He immediately grabbed a pith safari cap from an almost explicitly hidden coat rack and placed it on his head. “I must show you my research and answer all of the questions you have from last night. We will venture out, visit the orchard, and then come back for lunch. Herr Manuel, once we’ve eaten and taken a rest- for you will want one, I assure you- I will show you the most prized book in my family’s collection. For now, come! Come, gentle friends. We must be off!” 

Professor Maxwell was already through the door, donning his coat and fedora as he went. He still had an almost puppy-like excitement that kept me from recognizing the man I’d come to know and admire for his stoicism. I still recall the long nights we spent together in his study, sparing over Aristotle and Marx. His eyes were sharper then, and untrusting. I’d worked for years beneath him just to get him comfortable enough to say my first name. He was like a tiger I’d befriended over months of slow and steady approach, working patiently and calmly enough that I could now pet him without fearing a bite. 

When you died, Marie, he was the only one who checked on me. 

Now, this mysterious doctor we’ve just met practically has him house-broken. I am perplexed to say the least. 

That said, I followed the pair closely out and followed them into the yard. I was almost stunned with how fast they were moving, given their age. In the gray light of day, I could now take in the expanding sage clearing that spread out for two acres around the hillside where we stood.  We were fenced in by an army of pine and holly trees that seemed to stretch the stratus clouds even thinner than they were. 

Weber was speeding along to an opening in the treeline, marked ominously by a dead poplar tree. A carpet of brown leaves wound down into a curving path, and the Doctor gestured to it like the Yellow Brick Road. 

“This way, gentle friends! The grove is only a half mile away.” He started down the path without looking back, completely confident in our obedience. He had no reason to worry, it seemed. We both took off after him, trying to keep pace with his surprisingly lively gait. (For such an old man, he moves like a fox!) 

I struggled myself to keep up with the two older men, as it appeared even the professor had more pep in his step than normal. 

I dare not wonder if it’s a result of the fruit. 

We ended up in another clearing before long, and discovered Weber, perfectly full of breath and free of exhaustion, puffing on the last bit of his cigar. He extinguished it on a patch of wet clay while Maxwell fanned himself with his hat and I loosened my tie. I had to pick a piece of pine straw out of my collar, along with a deer tick. 

“I am glad to see my old bones don’t slow down the young and healthy!” the old man laughed, straightening his tie. “Welcome, dear friends, to the grove.”

“Shall we see a specimen today then?” I asked, fanning my shirt against my chest. “One of the trees for this supposed miracle fruit of yours?”

“It is no miracle,” he said in a tone more serious than I expected. “I would thank you for remembering that much.”

His eyes grew darker for a hair of a second before resetting back to the same gentle face we’d grown accustomed to. I admit I almost jumped when he did so. I then got a soft look of reproach from the professor, who seemed offended on Weber’s behalf for my sharp comment.

“Now then, Maxwell,” he said, “He is simply tired from the jaunt over, is all. Let us come this way, I think and we shall see… Ah! Yes. Here is one!”

We followed him briefly around a cluster of shrubs and oak before taking in a sight that almost cost me my stomach. 

Before us, unlike anything I’ve ever seen, was a tree of medium height. Its bark was ruddy and firm, almost like that of a birch but smoother. I can’t compare the color in my head- Lord forgive me for thinking this- to anything other than the hue of dried blood. That alone was cause for alarm amongst the soft gray bodies of the vegetation around us, but as I took more of it in, I realized it was covered in *thorns*.

Even now I fear I underplay it in my writing. When I say it was covered in thorns, I don’t mean like that of a hawthorne or honeylocust. These thorns were all at least three inches long and pale at the tips, giving them the impression of horns or claws protruding from flesh. The leaves, likewise, were full, almost black in color, and surrounded on the perimeter by jagged points. By all accounts, they looked worse than decomposed. They looked *otherworldly*. 

“Here we have it, gentlemen,” Weber said, approaching the tree with admiration. “An infant, but still of use! Behold the *Verger* tree!” 

He raised his hand and suddenly I became aware of something weighing down the lowest branches. On the ends of some of the growths were masses of pink, fleshly buds, each at least the size of a golf ball. From each side of them, long tendrils covered in thorns draped down like willow leaves, scratching away at that topsoil as the wind swayed them. 	“Forgive the bareness of the tree,” Weber said, “This is where I harvested last. For dinner, you remember.”

My stomach was knotted up as the implications of such a plant became made known to me. I was sick, but at the same time had a hard time rationalizing why. As incredible as it was, science told me this was still just a tree and not something cast down from heaven. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about this plant. 

“You’ll notice gentlemen, that the soil around it is not generous with nutrients. In fact, it is nearly devoid of nutrients. Maxwell,” he said, with earnesty, “would you kindly take a look at this deposit here?” 

He pointed to a small patch of grainy, white soil not far from one of the veiny roots of the tree. Maxwell did as asked and bent down to examine it. He rubbed it between his fingers, sniffed it, and after a brief moment’s thought, placed some on his tongue. His eyes went wide as the flavor hit him.

“Why, it’s salt!” he said, almost gasping. “Salt and clay….” He looked at the doctor in amazement as the German spoke.

“A wonder, yes? Though a mistake on my part, to some degree.” He went up to the tree and plucked off one of the golf-ball fruits. “I was experimenting with soil compositions, trying hard to breed out a weakness inherent in the plant.” He bent down beside Maxwell and dropped the fleshy fruit into the deposit. I was stunned to see it almost immediately shrivel up and dry as the salt touched it. It was almost comical, like something from a picture-show. Unreal, yet so lifelike. 

“Salt seems to destroy the fruit almost immediately and stunts the growth of the trees,” he said, rising. “I salted this ground myself at great risk of my own horrible failure to prove its resiliency. This,” he said with a gesture, “is the tree and its fruit at its weakest.” We stood in silence as we contemplated last night’s dinner. “As you can see, even crippled, the tree can perform wonders.”

“A tree with fruit like that, that can grow nearly anywhere….” Maxwell’s face regained the sharpness I was used to, if only briefly, as his mind wandered into the realm of possibilities. 

“Wait,” I said, breaking his wonder, “If this is the species at its lowest and contained, then what does it look like at its height?”

It was then Weber gave me an almost devilish smile, and one that tried hard to hide any malice. He clapped me on the shoulder, and softly told me, “ask, my friend, and you shall receive.” 

With that he turned around and gestured us along another path, away from the sapling.

 (I can’t believe I can call it that, but I’m running out of words to describe it.)

Maxwell’s face was still swimming with thought as we followed the doctor. Through the crackling of leaves and twigs beneath our feet, I could swear I could hear him muttering. I even think it was a name. 

I hardly had time to speculate. 

“You probably wonder how it is that this plant lives if not through nutrient-rich soil, sunlight, and water,” Weber said, his back to us, pacing along like a specter in the thicket. He made almost no sound upon the leaves as he walked. “It is a strange matter, is it not?”

“I’d say it is,” I told him.

“Your mind has no doubt wondered about it since my demonstration back there, Herr Manuel,” he said. “That said, I must ask- as my mind slips- have I asked you about your german? How well do you know it?” 

“You have not and I know little outside of ‘please,’ ‘thank you,’ and, ‘where is the bathroom?’” 

“Hmmm,” he said, slowing his pace. “I have a dictionary back at the house that should help you. Learn the meaning of *verger* and then I believe you will come to understand. For now, I will leave you with Latin. I believe that will suffice. Yes….” He stopped and faced me with a dark glint in his eye. “*Natura vindicat*.”

“Nature…” I said as I stumbled through my roots. “Nature… nature *reclaims*?”

He smiled at me. 

	“Very good,” he said. “Now let us examine this principle in action, shall we?”

	We rounded into another clearing where the soil once again became bare, though unlike the last patch, this one was dark and rich. My eyes weren’t on the ground for long, however, as they were soon drawn to the sight of *it*.

	Before us, towering over every tree in the vicinity, was a *Wünger.* It stood at least forty to fifty feet tall, with each of its rust-red limbs stretching out like a toothy web overhead of us. Long, sinewy vines of thorns and black leaves wove through the tops of surrounding oaks and firs with impunity, stretching off into nowhere. I almost dropped my journal as I took it in. 

	I tried writing something down earlier about it, but I couldn’t even process what I saw into words. I can barely process it now. 

	Marie, there were living things caught up in that tree’s thorns. Struggling things. Spaced out like flies in a spiderweb, there were squirrels, various birds, mice, even what looked like a fox impaled upon those horn-like growths. The leaves around us were speckled with crimson and I swear I could hear the labored breaths of those suffering creatures above us. 

	Just when I thought my horror couldn’t grow, Weber whistled at me and Maxwell. I’m relieved to write that the sight of this monstrosity seemed to shock him just as much as it did me, but neither of us were prepared for what we saw next.

	Weber was standing a few yards away from us, pointing down at a blob of pink that was almost the size of a toddler. A huge fleshy melon, free of blemish or bruising, sat at his feet. A long conical branch connected it to the tree and several of those sharp tentacles splayed out around it. 

	I puked. 

	“I apologize, Herr Manuel,” Weber said, offering me a handkerchief that Maxwell had to pass me. I couldn’t bear to look up and risk seeing that thing again. 

	“It is a lot to take in at first,” he said, “and I do truly apologize for not properly warning you. You see,” he said pointing toward one of the entangled, bleeding animals above us, “the species is carnivorous, not unlike the venus flytrap. It survives such harsh conditions because for reasons I have yet to discern, it grows just as well on blood as it does on water and sunlight. That said, it’s parasitic nature and the size of its unharvested fruits- such as this one here…” He thumped the melon with his thumb and forefinger, creating a noise that almost made me puke again. “Well, you understand why I harvested from the lesser and not the greater.” 

	He crossed the distance and laid a caring hand on my back. “I know. I know. Nature, Herr Manuel is a fickle and oftentimes cruel thing. *Mien Gott*, if you could even read of the nature of animals in the wild, you would soon understand this is not even among its greatest horrors. Penguins, dolphins, cats, even the simple duck! All of them are guilty of atrocities greater than this, I assure you.”

	I eventually steadied myself and regained my posture, leading the good doctor to giving me a firm pat on my back. Maxwell, however, was still looking at the melon. He started to reach out for it, slowly, before Weber snapped, “No, Maxwell!” 

	With incredible speed, he took hold of the professor’s wrist and pulled him to his feet. There was a strained silence and concerned gaze passed between the two of them before Weber finally let go. 

	“I-I,” he stuttered as he adjusted his glasses, “I’m sorry, my friend. It’s just that this tree… Well, it gives one cause for concern. Please, if you ever see fruit larger than your fist, do not touch it. The thorns can be tricky and by the time a fruit is *this* large, it is no longer ripe.”

	“Why is there only one fruit on this tree?” Maxwell asked, his eyes wandering around the surrounding area. “Should there not be more?”

	“I imagine there are,” said Weber, “but the nature of the vines and my harvesting habits leave it hard to find any fruits simply lying around. With the size of this, and the other trees, it’s hard to say where they’ll pop up.”

	“Others?” I found myself saying. Weber nodded. 

	“There are three other trees, like this one,” he said, “though I doubt they’re as big.”

	I’d be lying if I said my blood didn’t run cold. That tree, its fruit, the nature of its survival, all terrified me. 

	I wished and still do hope to be back in Virginia soon. The Georgia isles can wait. I simply wish to be back home. 

	We traveled back after that, and, despite the horror we’d both experienced, Maxwell was once again casually talking to Weber about logistics. They prattled on about giving lectures on the fruit. On the profits, both financially and socially, of this discovery. They talked of aiding starving families, of emptying children’s hospitals, and ending cancer. They spoke of Utopia, but I could only see Hell. I still do. Every time I think of that tree, I shudder. 

	Even now, I hold back. I’m looking over my shoulder as I write this. Weber should be arriving at my door any minute now. He wishes to show me his most valuable book, but I’m concerned at what this might entail. None of his surprises have been good so far. 

	Enough. I shall write this last thing and leave it be for now, just for the sake of my nerves. It couldn’t have been right, and I’m sure my eyes were playing tricks on me, but while traveling back to the house, I checked the path behind us and saw something moving in the brush. 

	I got separated from the others for a brief moment, so only I witnessed this, but out of the woods, walking along the path, there came a deer. 

	It was an eight-point buck, fit with a speckled mane and white tail. This alone wasn’t what startled me, but what was on it did. Growing around the antlers, tangled and menacing, were little black vines and leaves. Any thorns they had were invisible to me, and they did not disappear when I rubbed my eyes. What was not invisible was the rabbit in its mouth.

	Like some wild dog, this stag had a bloodied rabbit hanging from its almost unnaturally wide jaws. It almost looked like it had fangs, but I was too far away to tell. I swear, I feel mad just writing this down, but it looked at me, Marie.

I can’t get its eyes out of my head. They were leaking some black, viscous substance that crusted against its fur. 

Without warning, it fled back into the woods, carrying the rabbit with it. I still don’t know what to make of it, but if it’s real, then what? Why did it look like part of the tree? Or vice versa? I must have been hallucinating. I must have. 

Marie, I can’t help but think of those words Weber told me. 

*Natura Vincidcat*. 

Nature Reclaims. 

I’m hungry….

I can’t remember why because it’s been so long, but I was a bit disenchanted with it all and decided not to post it anywhere until now. I will put some links in the comment section to original art that goes with the story. Thank you for reading if you do! It means the world!]

I began dental assisting nearly four years ago. I still remember how overwhelming all of the information was, but how exhilarating it was to assist with my first filling or make my first temporary crown. The dentist I worked for at the time had no patience to teach me. It was during the height of the pandemic when everyone was desperate for workers. He never wanted to teach an uneducated fry cook how to assist from scratch, but that's what he got... It was sink or swim for the next six months.


I eventually found work at a beautiful dental office in an upscale neighborhood on the outskirts of our medium-sized city. I barely met the minimum requirements to assist at such a high-class office, but the office manager took a liking to me and did all she could to continue my on-site learning. The staff size was staggering compared to the four-person team I had become accustomed to. Six hygienists, eight assistants, four dentists, and a fully staffed front desk. The majority of the team was made up of women. The drama that came from that place… let’s just say I could write a separate story on that alone.


By the time I had quit working for that office, I was nearly a full-functioning assistant. I finally found the perfect job and had the confidence to take on the role of head assistant in a small-town office about 30 minutes from the city.


The first time I met Dr. Lance and his wife Angela, I was enamored with their youthful and vibrant energy. They were young, fun, and seemed like an educated young couple. Angela took care of the scheduling and billing while Dr. Lance ran things on the clinical side. Since the office was so small, there was only one hygienist who would come twice a week. Most of the time, it was just the three of us. They took good care of me—bought me lunch at least twice a week, paid for all of my scrubs, and gave me a great salary.


The only thing that ever got under my skin was the corny dad jokes Dr. Lance would subject our patients to when their mouths were full of instruments and hands. I figured if that was the worst of my worries, I’d be happy here for a long time.


But things changed after about a year and a half. At first, it was subtle. Dr. Lance would come to work with bags under his eyes, a stark contrast to his usual morning-person attitude. His hair, which he used to gel every morning without fail, often looked as if he'd forgotten to brush it. I thought it might be due to lack of sleep or maybe some tension between him and Angela. Either way, I didn't think it was any of my business.


However, as weeks passed, things worsened. Dr. Lance started nodding off during our morning meetings. I decided to ask Angela what was going on.


""Angela,"" I said in a low voice as I leaned over the side of her desk, ""Is Doc doing okay?""
As soon as I finished the sentence, her gaze shot over to me from whatever she had been so concentrated on only seconds before. She looked almost… anxious.


""Yeah, why? Did he say something?"" she asked quickly, her tone laced with suspicion.
""No, he just looks tired,"" I replied, confusion creeping into my voice. What was going on with them?
""I'm sure he's fine. Go make sure sterilization is caught up,"" she snapped.


I walked to the sterilization lab with my heart in my throat. She had never been irritable with me in my whole year and a half of employment. My feelings were slightly hurt, but I still wasn’t too concerned. If anything, it just confirmed in my mind that they had been arguing. It broke my heart to think of them having marital problems. They were so young and seemed so in love only weeks before. I shook it off and continued with my daily tasks.


After this encounter, I started noticing more things that seemed off. Dr. Lance began diagnosing teeth for extraction that, by all appearances, were healthy. At first, I chalked it up to my ignorance, but at this point, I had been reading X-rays for almost four years. I knew what a cavity looked like and what bone loss looked like. These teeth were neither.


At first, it was just one or two questionable extractions a week, but as time went on, it became more frequent. One day, he diagnosed four unnecessary extractions before our lunch break at noon. I decided it was time to say something before things got out of hand. I didn’t want him to lose his license and, more than that, I wanted our patients to keep their perfectly healthy teeth.


“Hey, Doc,” I said with a gentle knock on his office door, slowly pushing it open. Before I could finish my sentence, I noticed his eyes and nose were red and puffy. Had he been crying?
“Come in. What’s up?” he said quickly, wiping one eye. He was trying to hide it, but he wasn’t doing a very good job.
“Are you okay?” I asked as I sat in the chair next to his.
“Yeah, I’m good. What did you need?” he replied with a layer of irritability under the gentle tone I had become accustomed to.
It felt like a bad time to bring up the subject, but I guessed there would never be a good time to tell a doctor they were wrong. I let out a deep sigh before continuing.
“I noticed you seem tired lately. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay… I don’t want to pry by any means, it just seems to be affecting your work.”


I paused and suppressed a cringe. I had never said something so bold to a doctor. He was normally so rational and understanding, but the tension in the office had changed what I felt was acceptable. He didn’t respond right away—just stared at a vial of teeth that sat under his computer monitor for a moment too long.


“There were some cases recently that seemed—”
He sat up in his chair abruptly and looked at me with a deep rage in his eyes. It didn’t even look like him. It was so sudden it forced me to jump back.
“Get out,” he said in a low growl.
I stared in shock for a moment, unable to move.
“I said, GET OUT!” He yelled in a voice I had never heard before and never wanted to hear again.
I scampered away, tripping on the chair leg on my way out. I fell face-first on the floor and cried out in pain. Dr. Lance nearly leaped out of his chair to my side. I expected him to ask if I was okay or maybe give me a hand off the floor, but I was deeply mistaken.


Dr. Lance rolled me over onto my side forcefully and grabbed my face with one hand. He squeezed my cheeks, forcing my mouth open wide. I whimpered in fear of what he might do. He leaned down under my chin to look at the roof of my mouth, then from a top angle down at my lower jaw. He searched my mouth for something like a rabid animal.


The look on my face and the sound of my cries must have snapped him back to reality because he fell back, letting go of my face.
“S-sorry, Amelia…” he stammered, “Just making sure you didn’t hurt any of those pearly whites.” He faked a chuckle, and I unconsciously scooted back against the wall.


I felt the tears welling up, and after making eye contact, I ran to my car without hesitation. I didn’t even take a moment to process what happened; I just drove home in a nearly catatonic state. Once I got home, I called Angela and told her I wasn’t feeling well and needed to take the day off. Lucky for me, it was Friday, so I wouldn’t have to address the situation until Monday. I’d have some time to think about what was going on and what I should do.


That Sunday was uneventful. I did some chores, watched a couple of movies, and spent time with my dogs. It was about 6 p.m. when I received a phone call from the hygienist, Sadie. She was frantic, and her words were hard to understand through her hysterics.
“Amelia… Oh my god. Amelia… can you hear me?”
“Yeah, Sadie, what’s wrong?”
“Doc—It’s Doctor… Doctor Lance. He—he’s dead, or missing… or—or—”
“Sadie, calm down. What are you talking about? I can’t understand you. Where are you?”
“Come to the office, please.”


And just like that, she hung up. My heart was racing, and my thoughts were reeling as I jumped in my car and drove to the office, similar to how I had rushed home after Friday’s incident.


When I arrived, the parking lot was empty except for Sadie's car and the old sedan that belonged to Angela. The office was dark, but I could see a faint light coming from inside. I took a deep breath and walked up to the door, my hands shaking. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the dread settling in my stomach told me it wasn't good.


Inside, I found Sadie pacing the waiting room, her face pale and her eyes wide with fear. Angela was seated behind the reception desk, staring blankly at a spot on the wall, her face wet with tears.
“What’s going on?” I demanded, my voice breaking as the tension overwhelmed me.


Sadie looked at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. “I don’t even think I can-”
“Let’s take a seat, Sadie. Let me get some water.” I was trying hard to suppress my growing fear. I made my way to the water cooler in the break room and filled two plastic cups with cold water. I trembled my way back to the waiting room where Sadie sat biting her nails on one of the waiting room chairs. I handed her one of the glasses of water. 


She took a shaky sip and then a deep breath. “I was supposed to meet the Lances for Lunch. We were going to discuss expanding the hygiene program to three days a week. When I got there, I knocked but no one answered. After I tried a few times, I started walking back to my car when I noticed a little pool of blood coming from under the garage door.” Sadies voice began to quiver and crack. I could feel her fear tangibly. “I didn’t think, I just pulled on the front door. It was unlocked so I ran to the garage from the inside and… Oh god, Amelia…” She began to cry once more as she put her face in her hands. “It’s alright Sadie, take your time,” I said as I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. I was never good at comforting a crying person, but I tried my best. 


She wiped her tears and took another sip of water. “There were little blood spatters a-and pools littered all over the garage. At least four pairs of bloody pliers I counted on the floor, but I-I didn’t see anyone. There was a rope hanging from the rafters… a noose. But there was no one in it. The chair was even knocked over under it like someone had really done it. There was blood on the rope and everything. It was terrible… so terrible. Amelia something bad happened.” She continued sobbing as I sat in disbelief. “Sadie, did you call the police?” I asked quickly. 


“Of course child, I was with them all afternoon. They asked me so many questions, I couldn’t think straight when I left there. Their home looks like a god damn haunted house with all the crime scene tape. I never thought I’d see something like this Amelia.” As she continued her endless sobbing, I comforted her with a hug. Normally I’d sit uncomfortably while the grieving person did their thing, but in this moment, I needed that hug just as much as she did. I cried with her in all of my confusion, fear, and stress. I hoped the following days would bring answers. I hoped this was a terrible misunderstanding, but I should have known better. 


I didn’t get much sleep that night. I sat up, my mind racing with endless questions. What could it all mean? Where was his body? Could he still be alive? Was this some terrible joke? And where was Angela? If it was murder, why the noose? The thoughts swirled in my head, loud and unrelenting. Little did I know, some of these questions would soon be answered.


The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had been run over. No one had contacted me about work, but I decided to go in, just in case someone was expecting me. When I arrived, I tried the front door, but it was locked. I headed to the back and used my key to get in. I set my bag on the breakroom table and quietly walked around the office, going room by room. I didn’t hear or see anyone, but something felt wrong. The air was thick and heavy, and the entire place seemed different. I told myself it was probably just the aftermath of last night's events.


When I reached Dr. Lance's office, I slowly opened the door. I half-expected to see him sitting there with a smile, asking about my weekend. If I hadn’t been so frightened of him after Friday, I might have even wished to confide in him about his own disappearance. But the office was as empty as I had expected. 

As I scanned the room, something caught my eye on the corner of his desk. I stepped closer for a better look, and my brain struggled to make sense of the grisly sight in front of me. It was a canine tooth crossed under a lateral, with a molar perched on top. The roots of the molar wrapped around the single-rooted teeth, acting as a sort of clamp. They were still bloody, the blood looking dried, but not completely—still holding onto its red hue. I stared at it, unsure of what to do.


I decided to run to the nearest operatory to put on gloves. Grabbing a sterile pouch from the lab, I carefully placed the strange tooth formation inside. I examined it for a few moments before sliding it into my pocket. I searched the room for any other signs of something unusual, but nothing else seemed out of place. The only thing missing was the small vial of teeth Dr. Lance had been staring at before he lashed out at me. I wondered if it meant anything, but decided to bring the evidence to the police and give them any information they might need.


As I turned to leave the room, I nearly collided with Angela, who was standing silently behind me. I screamed, jumping out of my skin. Once I realized who it was, I bent over, trying to catch my breath. “Jesus, Angela, you scared me half to death. I didn’t think you’d be coming to work today.” I waited for a response, but she stared blankly at the corner of the desk. “Angela? Are you alright?” I asked, growing concerned.


“What were you doing in here?” she asked, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. My face grew pale. Not this again, I thought. This strange energy was getting out of hand, and I felt like a frightened animal backed into a corner. “N-nothing, I just—”
“You have no reason to be in here. Get out,” she said, her voice lifeless. I completely understood, considering what had just happened to her husband. I nodded and slipped out of the room without protest. As I rushed back to the break room, a shiver ran down my spine. All of this odd behavior was getting to me, so I grabbed my bag and hurried out the back door. 


As I pulled out of the parking lot, I decided I didn’t want to go home just yet. There was so much going through my mind, and I needed to clear my head with a nice long drive. I drove around the familiar streets and backroads of the town for about forty-five minutes, lost in thought. Eventually, I decided to drive past the Lance's home, just to see if what Sadie had described was exaggerated or not.


I had only visited their white picket-fenced home once before. They had invited me over one Friday to play some board games with their twin niece and nephew. They were about my age, and we actually had a wonderful time. Being fairly anti-social, it was a pleasant surprise to get along so well with a four-person group. The whole family seemed picture-perfect, with their welcoming smiles and a home that smelled like warm coffee and vanilla. As I reminisced, I turned the corner onto their street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the end of it. 


Their beautiful home, once a place of love and excitement, was now a sight that would make anyone feel sick. It made me wonder once more how things had gone so wrong so quickly.
The crime scene tape covered the closed garage door, the front door, and acted as a fence around the whole yard. It was completely void of life, and the beautiful flowers that once lined the walkway were shriveled and dried. I slowly drove to the end of the street and parked my car in front of the neighbor's house for a moment. My nose began to sting as tears welled up again. A single tear rolled down my cheek, but before I could really cry, I noticed one of the blinds in the upstairs windows being pulled down as if someone was trying to peek out without being seen. My emotions quickly shifted to laser focus. I couldn’t make out any person, and for a moment, I thought maybe the blinds were just broken and always looked like that. 


As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I received a text. I glanced down at my phone and saw “Text message—Angela.” I didn’t open it right away but looked back up at the window. The blinds were back in their original shape, as if nothing had ever been out of place. My heart stopped, and I sucked in a barely audible gasp before quickly shifting my car back into drive. I didn’t want to stick around to see who or what was watching me. I whipped out of that neighborhood like a bat out of hell and decided it was time to go home.


As soon as I got home, I sank into the couch and turned on the TV. Angela's text was still waiting on my phone. I let Face ID unlock it so I could see the preview. It read, “Don’t be messing with things that you don—” The pit in my stomach deepened. I hadn’t even read the whole text, but I felt like I was being threatened by the Italian mafia or something. “Fuck, dude,” I said out loud to myself. I was so tired of all this mess. At this point, I felt like begging my previous boss for my job back. I’d gladly take some Gossip Girl drama over whatever this was.
I braced myself before opening the full message from Angela.

 “Don’t be messing with things that you don’t understand, Amelia. I need you to return what you stole by tomorrow morning. If it isn’t returned, bad things will happen. I’m serious.” Now, I felt that my life was in danger. I contemplated my next actions carefully. Should I respond to her text or just leave it alone and call the police? I was scared. No, I was terrified. I wanted out of this situation and didn’t want to deal with whatever messy consequences would inevitably come from all of this. But I knew I didn’t have a choice. I decided to do both. 

I quickly typed back, “You’re really scaring me, Angela,” and hit send. I decided I would visit the police department first thing tomorrow morning. I’d bring them the odd tooth formation I found and show them the creepy text I received from Angela. I was beginning to think Angela played a big part in whatever happened to Dr. Lance. I got up and made sure all of my doors and windows were locked, just in case I really was in danger. I didn’t fully believe Angela’s threat, but I didn’t want to take any chances either.


As I made my way to the kitchen to make myself a light lunch, my phone chimed again. “Text message—Angela.” This time, I immediately opened it. “This is much bigger than both of us. I’m warning you because I care about you. Do as I say, Amelia, or you will regret it.” I nearly dropped my phone. What the hell was she talking about? I decided it was time to turn my phone on Do Not Disturb.


 This was all too messy and too much for my brain to wrap around. I made myself a PB&J and turned on YouTube. I watched Moist Critical police chase videos and crocheted until the sun went down. It worked. I managed to wash my brain of the issue that had been haunting me, even if it was only temporary.


Around nine-thirty, I took my dogs out and herded them into their kennels. Most nights, I let them sleep in my bed, but tonight I wanted them to stay in the living room so that if anyone tried to break in, they would alert me. I brought my katana, which normally hung on the wall for decoration, into the bedroom with me. I set it on the floor next to my bed and wrapped myself up in the comforter. Surprisingly, it didn’t take long for me to fall asleep, despite my current dilemma. The constant stress must have been wearing on me.


It was three-thirty on the dot when my eyes shot open. I didn’t hear or feel anything out of the ordinary, so I wasn’t sure what had woken me. My eyes drifted to the alarm clock, and I lay still and silent, just to make sure it wasn’t an intruder. But my dogs were quiet, which meant I was safe. I let out a deep, sleepy breath and rolled onto my side, ready to drift back to sleep. That’s when I heard it—a plastic-sounding scrape coming from under the bed.


I froze, straining to listen. The floors were real wood, so I thought maybe one of the dog balls was rolling around with a draft, something that happened from time to time. But what I heard next was unmistakably horrifying: an impossibly deep, nearly demonic-sounding breath, like the sound CGI dinosaurs make in movies when they’re quietly hunting their prey. My skin turned to ice, and my whole body went rigid.


“Amelia, is it?” a deep, whispering voice came from directly beneath me. I couldn’t move, let alone respond. I heard it shift slightly, but it didn’t sound like a person with rustling clothes—it was more like plastic beads rolling on the floor. Something crawled up the wall and gently placed itself over my forehead. It felt like a snake-like tentacle, covered in hard bumps. I whimpered, paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t see anything in the pitch-black room, and the thought of dying at the hands of an unknown creature in my own bed was too much to process.
Its voice came again, like the sound of a spinning quarter on a wooden desk. “A woman of great taste…” It trailed off as another beady tentacle slithered under my chin. 


Tears silently rolled down my face, wetting my hair beneath me. I sniffled and grimaced at the disgusting creature holding onto me. “A profession of little desire… but why?” it asked in a menacing tone. The tentacle under my chin slithered its way between my lips, forcing my mouth open. I tried to keep my jaw shut, but the creature’s strength was unimaginable. I thought my jaw might break if I resisted any longer. 


The tip of the tentacle probed around inside my mouth, starting on the top right and moving to the back, feeling each and every one of my teeth one by one, right to left, left to right. I trembled uncontrollably, hoping against all hope that this was the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.


When it reached the lower right side of my mouth, the tip of the tentacle perched itself on top of my last molar. With one quick tap, I felt the tooth crack, and I screamed in agony. During my four years as a dental assistant, I had learned that each tooth has somewhere around seventy nerve endings, and I felt each and every one of them screaming for help. The tentacle flicked upward, running itself from my soft palate, causing me to gag, to the back of my front teeth. 


I continued to cry in pain as it caressed my face with the now slobbery tentacle. “Return what is not yours, and you’ll never have to see me again… I don’t want to turn any more of those pearly whites into a problem.” As it spoke its last words, it slowly released me. 

I heard the beady creature recoil under the bed as the right side of my face throbbed. I needed medical attention or painkillers, but both were far out of reach for the same reason—I couldn’t force myself to leave the bed. So I lay there, frozen, staring at the ceiling in silence until the sun came up. At some point, I managed to curl myself into the fetal position, quivering uncontrollably.


 I probably would have stayed there forever in shock if my dogs hadn’t started whining and scratching at their kennels. This was their normal morning behavior, their reminder to Mom to get them breakfast.


Slowly, I unfolded myself and sat up, scanning the room for any Cthulhu-like creatures, but of course, everything was in its place. I carefully scooted to the edge of the bed, where the door handle was waiting for me. I reached for the handle, opened the door without taking a step off the bed, took a shaky breath, jumped off the bed, and ran to the living room as if something were on my heels. I looked around and finally accepted that I was safe. I opened the two kennels and gladly welcomed the excited kisses from my dogs, their fuzzy bottoms giving me a small rush of serotonin. 


Once they were taken care of, I grabbed the stupid tooth formation from the counter and made my way to the office once again. I didn’t even change out of my sweatpants or my stained PJ shirt. I looked exactly how I felt.


I pulled into the office parking lot to find it was empty once more. I unlocked the back door, flung it open, and hustled to Dr. Lance's office. I placed the sterile pouch containing the creepy teeth on the desk and quickly made my way back to the exit. I didn’t look around for anything odd or try to gather any more clues—I was done. I never wanted any reason to piss that thing off again. I didn’t care if Dr. Lance’s body was super glued to the wall—I didn’t see anything.


I quickly drove to the prompt care clinic a few blocks away and waited for a couple of agonizing hours before I was finally seen. When they brought me back, I explained that I had broken a tooth by biting down on an almond. The lie was stupid, but I couldn’t think of anything else. They took an X-ray, and when the doctor came in, he looked peppy, but I wasn’t feeling it. “Looks like you had a rough night!” he said with a small chuckle and a big white smile.
“Yeah,” I grumbled, trying not to act like a total jerk.
“I was looking over your chart and X-rays. You bit down on an almond?” he asked, as if it were unbelievable. I nodded, wondering why he was questioning my story. I thought it was the most believable I could come up with. “It’s just that the tooth cracked in a very unique way. I’ve never seen a crack quite like this. I’m no dentist, but we do get our fair share of tooth infections and fractures on the weekends.”


I quickly followed up, “May I see? I work in dental.” I was nervous, wondering how badly this thing had messed up my mouth.
“Sure thing,” he said, pulling up the X-ray software on the monitor in front of us. When he opened the periapical, I was floored.


As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been reading X-rays for about four years. I’ve seen many things that defy what I believed to be standard: a front tooth that broke in half horizontally, a tooth stuck sideways in someone's chin, a grown woman with seven baby teeth—you name it, and it’s most likely happened. But when I saw the state of my molar, which had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, it absolutely defied my expectations. 


The tooth had a large abscess at both root tips, at least three large cavities, and the crown had been split into four pieces, divided by the roots. The cracks visible in the X-ray were so large that we didn’t need a specialist to locate them.
“Jesus Christ,” I finally managed to say.
“My thoughts exactly! But it looks like this tooth has been a silent problem for many years. Let’s get you some antibiotics for that abscess, and then you should see your dentist as soon as possible.”
“Okay, thanks,” I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the screen. I didn’t blame him for thinking this had been an ongoing problem. If I had seen this in someone else, I would have said the same thing.


I made an appointment at one of the corporate dental offices in my area to get the tooth extracted. They were able to get me in the same day, so after the appointment, I came home with a numb face and one less tooth in my jaw. I asked the doctor to let me keep my tooth so I could examine it when I got home. I held it up in the ziplock bag and gazed in amazement, thinking about how something so small could cause so much pain. I decided it was time to start looking for a new job, and I hoped I’d never hear from Angela again.

*August 22:*

Doctor Weber takes care to keep himself hidden from public life. It’s been three days since we passed Raleigh, and I fear it will be another day still before we make it out of the Blue Ridge and into the Piedmont. Professor Maxwell tells me that patience is a virtue and that before we know it, we’ll be nestled comfortably back home in Virginia, richer than Midas and more revered than Solomon. I dare not point out that half the reason it’s taken us so long to make it down south is that he insisted on driving us down, missing the turn in Spartansburg, and leading us down a mountain path instead of the coastline I was so excited to see.   
  
I mustn't be so critical of my mentor, however. Such an accomplished scientist would rarely take his assistant to an almost literal goldmine of discovery. He hasn’t told me much of this Professor Weber. Only whatever he has developed in his greenhouse could change the course of not only our lives but the lives of every starving American living in Hoovervilles and working long weeks for the sake of a quarter. 

I believe he lost a poor relative to starvation sometime last year, though I do not know the conditions surrounding it. I do recall his melancholic state and how often bourbon glasses surrounded his desk. I often heard him muttering a name over and over in his liquor dreams, though male or female I have no clue. 

What I do know is that the man I sit next to now is not that man. Here, in this truck, his blue eyes transfixed on the road, I see a man of firm resolve. The beard he’s grown in the last few months makes him look like a prospector shoved into a suit. His bowtie is scrappy as is his mood. He hasn’t even stopped to ask what I’m writing but has occasionally gone off on winded stories of how he and his family traveled through these hills often when he was a young boy. He alludes to having a sibling of some sort but drops them from conversation as soon as they’re brought up.   
  
I read once that a Spanish explorer traversed this area in search of gold and glory. He died somewhere in the South I believe. However, I am certain that if his spirit lives on, it is in the heart of my dear mentor.   
  
  
  
The road grows bumpy and it’s becoming harder to write. Will resume on smoother ground.   
  
  
  
\*12pm- or thereabouts:\*  
  
The oddest people live in this region. Though not unkind, they are certainly a peculiar bunch. We have stopped off at a roadside gas station and drugstore, and a small barbecue hut within walking distance of the place has given me a picnic table to pen my remaining thoughts. After I ate, one of the waitresses- I believe that’s what she is at least- approached me and asked where I was heading. I told her that I was a botanist and that my mentor and I were traveling on business. I was able to point out the professor to her from my seat. He was leaning against the truck, smoking a cigar, and apparently in his own conversation with a clean-shaven man in overalls. Judging by their points and gestures, it was most likely for directions.   
  
She gave him an odd look, then wiped her hand on her apron. She was older than both of us by the look of her, with curly white hair tucked neatly under a paper cap. Her clothes had the occasional grease stain and her makeup was smudged from what I could only imagine was the heat of a kitchen, and yet she stared at us both as if we were tramps in a department store.   
  
“Where you folks headin’ again?” she asked.   
  
“I forget the name exactly,” I told her, “but I believe its name is something like ‘Portley’ or a place near there.”  
  
Her expression changed from confused disdain to wide-eyed concern. She almost dropped her ticket book as she spun around and took a seat next to me.   
  
“Listen here, son,” she told me, “Ifin it is Portley you’re going, I suggest you and your professor fella turn right on around and go back to wherever it was you come.”  
  
I protested, saying we’d already traveled all this way, and followed by asking what it was that had her so scared. She shook her head and said:  
  
“They ain't right up there. They just ain’t. Every once in a while, one of their ilk comes through on the way to Augusta or Athens or someplace like that, but every time they do there’s trouble.”  
  
She went on to mutter something about the way they move or talk, but she shook herself and coughed. When she stopped, she pulled out something from her pocket and placed it on the table near my paper plate. 	

“My family was one of the last catholic families in this region before they got tired of driving an hour to the nearest church every Sunday and converted to Baptist. Ifin you’re headin’ that way, you’ll want this.”

The object was a cheap rosary that was missing more than a few beads and bore a metal cross long since smudged from bright bronze to dull gold. It was brighter around the base, meaning someone had once committed regularly to hold it and pray the creed with it, making their mount cavalry out of a fist and bent knees. It was clearly a family heirloom, and one I tried to refuse, but the woman would have none of it.  
  
“Take it, by God, and by God may it either serve you or convince you to go back. The devil walks the earth, boy, and in Georgia his home is Portley. Anything or anyone there is not worth your soul.”  
  
I wanted to ask her more, but before I knew it, she was gone and the door to the hut was slammed shut. The sliding order door was closed immeadiately after and I was left alone at my picnic bench, surrounded by the goliath pines and oaks that spread out like an ocean around me. I find myself thumbing through the beads remaining on the rosary, reliving a bit of my childhood and more than likely disappointing my poor late mother as I stumble through them. I cannot help but think of the waitress’ words as I write.   
  
This cross reminds me of the rosary Marie once had.  
  
The professor approaches.   
  
  
  
\*Addendum:\*  
  
It seems my mentor was able to secure directions and we are now back in the car heading towards Portley. I haven’t mentioned anything to him about the rosary or the things the waitress said. However, I have noticed something concerning as we stumble into the growing dusk. There is now an old black bible seated between us. When I asked the professor where he’d gotten it, he laughed.   
  
“It’s the damnedest thing, John,” he said. “The gas station owner gave me directions then ran back inside to grab this. He shoved it on me and refused to take it back. Superstitious bunch down here.”  
  
I faked a laugh and he didn’t seem to notice. All is quiet now, but the closer we draw to the doctor’s house and the life-changing development he’s made in his reclusive home, I’m nervous.   
  
Must sleep it off.   
  
  
  
\*7:25 PM\*  
  
I am stirred awake by the roughness of the road. There is a pain in my neck from the angle I placed my head and my vision is hazy. \~\~I am filled with-\~\~  
  
I am tired.   
  
The professor is still awake but is not up for conversation- thus why I’m writing in my journal for the fourth time in a day. What he has said is that Portley is within the next ten miles, according to the directions the gas station owner gave us. I look forward to a bed, all concerns aside, and pray the doctor has food waiting for us. 

I have a pain in my throat now that makes me cough regularly. The professor isn’t noticeably bothered by this and has only said, “allergies,” in response to my racket. The pain and the coughing make me think of Marie. Her condition and loss still haunt me, it seems. Her, my mother… I fear I have a curse on me that causes women to die.

I cannot wait to have tea or coffee. Anything hot to make this go down and to shove those ideas out of my mind.   
  
I see a road sign coming up on our right.  
  
Finally,   
  
  
  
\*August 23- close to 5 AM:\*  
  
I have much to write despite it being so early. I’m struggling to rationalize and place all of the events from the latter half of my journey with what logically makes sense, so I think this is the best way to lay it all out.   
  
I find myself holding the rosary in my other hand while I write, but I can’t say solidly as to why.   
  
I’ll start with our entry.  
  
When we made it into town, I started to find myself disillusioned with the fears the waitress and gas station owner had so thoroughly tried to instill in me. The buildings were sparse, and the main road of the town was lined with very few stores. There were occasional houses and one or two plots that looked like small farms, but nothing overtly stood out. 

There were not many people out, most likely due to the time of night, but there were some. A group of men in their suspenders and work shirts huddled around a tiny of a storefront, resting on metal chairs and smoking their pipes and cigarettes. I could smell the cheap tobacco from the truck, and I still find its odor on my cardigan. 

From what I was told, I half expected them to throw bottles or rocks as we rode through the street. I expected a gun or knife to greet our tires or at least angry screams. None of that happened. They did the opposite. They waved at us.   
  
As I write that, I fear I underplay the effect it had on me. When I say they \*waived\* at us, I mean \*they\* waived at us. Every single one of them. Five men were in that group in total, and as soon as we passed by, every single one raised their (right?) hand, waved, and smiled.   
  
The professor waved back at them, but I could tell from his grip on the steering wheel, this bothered him too.   
  
We passed by a woman walking in a very rigid fashion, almost painfully erect in her posture, and she did the same. Same hand. Broad smile.   
  
It was when passing what looked like the county sheriff’s office, we were greeted by a dark-haired man in a tan deputy's uniform. He too waved and smiled, but lowered them as he stepped down from his perch on the sidewalk and approached the curb. The professor slowed the car down and- albeit reluctantly- rolled the window down.   
  
Taking the man in, I was shocked by how smooth his skin was and by how energetic he looked on what I could only assume was the tail-end of a long shift. I had an idea as to how his voice would sound this far down South, and almost jokingly wondered to myself if we’d even be able to understand him.   
  
Imagine how red my cheeks became as he spoke not only without an accent but almost impossibly proper English. I couldn’t begin to place a speech pattern. I still can’t, though the voice is still fresh in my mind.  
  
“Hello there,” he said. “Where are you from?”  
  
The professor explained we were heading to the residence of Doctor Andre Weber and if he had any directions. He didn’t drop his smile as he said:  
  
“Oh yes! Doctor Andre. He is indeed a very good doctor. He will no doubt expect you. You cannot keep him waiting.” 

There was an awkward pause before the professor asked again where his residence was, reading the address from our telegram that had invited us there in the first place.  I expected to hear another tight response but was more startled when the deputy shot his hand up and gestured down a right turn. He did not say any other direction besides this. The professor thanked him, prompting a, “It is my pleasure! Please enjoy your time in Portley!” but nothing else. 

His hand did not drop as he did this. 

We drove away and as we did, I noticed the deputy staring at us from the side-view mirror. He dropped his arm almost mechanically and turned sharply on his heels before walking away. He did so in the same fashion as the woman we’d seen before. 

“Friendly people,” Professor Maxwell said.

 I remember laughing, but not for the humor of it all. Another detail I noticed, just as the main road faded from view, was that the back sides of the buildings- though their fronts were pristine- were covered in thick blankets of ivy and Kudzu.  I do not know what to make of this, nor why it bothers me so much. I will write more about this later if my mind can make sense of it.

We spent another twenty minutes driving through the growing dark as cedar and oak trees loomed over us with long branches that reminded me of fingers. Each one bent unnaturally and scrapped against the roof of the truck. The road didn’t grow sturdier either, and at one point it was so rough I was convinced that we were going to pop a tire on some sharp rock or another. I would have worried about deer or other passing animals as well if I wasn’t so dazed from the jostling and neck pain I wrote of earlier. 

Winding road after winding road went on until finally, like some specter rising from the grave, the silhouette of a manor house came into view. In a large clearing where the land merged into a grand winding hill, the sharp treeline was conquered by the rising point of a roof. The amber lights of lit windows came into view and before I could process the magnitude of this large two-story house that sat strangely out of place in the middle of the Georgia woods, we were already parking in the driveway. 

“Finally!” Maxwell said, putting the truck in park. “I thought for sure we’d miss it.”

“Are you sure this is it?” I asked him. I know that sounds like a stupid question in retrospect, but I believe it was brought about by the unease that had settled into my system from the encounters we had in the town. I also still can’t shake the feeling of decay and overgrowth that lingers in the whole house. In the dark, I could see no discernable thing wrong with its face. However, the sides of the building were overrun with blossoming vines and ivy that outstretched to the wood paneling from the trellises. There was a wild look to it all, and even now as I write, I notice the fingers of Kudzu scratching at the base of my windowsill. 

I digress. 

We traversed the dry staircase that led to the front door and went to ring the bell, but the door swung open. I almost jumped, but was immediately disarmed when a small man in a tweed suit greeted us. 

He had a pair of wire-rimmed glasses and wore a slightly crooked and brightly colored bowtie. He sported a thick mustache that put my own to shame and, despite having very recessed pale temples, a thick mane of curly white hair that brushed his shoulders and collar. I expected a staunch and reserved greeting in that similar painful voice the deputy had given us back in town but to my pleasant alarm, he was downright jovial.

“It must be professor Maxwell I see before me!” he exclaimed, clasping my mentor's hand and shaking it vigorously. “I have eagerly awaited your arrival and now here you are! A blessing from… from… Well let's not dive into that. It is too late in the evening to discuss theology. I am Herr Weber-” I was still taking in his charming German accent when he turned to me and looked me up and down. He reminded me of a curious crow as he cocked his head to the side and mused to himself. 

“And who might this be?” he asked, though more to himself than anyone else.

“Johnathan Manuel,” I said, reaching out a hand. “It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.”

He stared at my hand for a beat, only moving his eyes and his face devoid of a smile. For a moment I was worried I had done something to offend him in some way. I jumped when his straight face burst into a wide laughing grin and he took my hand. His flesh was almost alarmingly rigid and cold, but his personality was anything but. 

“Herr Manuel. The pleasure of acquaintance is all mine. For when I thought I’d only be receiving one guest to this lonesome hill, I’ve been blessed with two! It’s practically a party!”

“Forgive me for the surprise guest, Dr. Weber,” said the professor. “The journey was simply too long to make by myself and I was concerned for my safety. That and- if I may be so bold to say in a company such as this- John is a dear friend despite my advantage in years. I trust him as I do my own family.”

For a moment I thought he almost said brother. 

“There is no apology needed. I agree, the distance is great, but I believe your time here will be worth it. I trust you’ve read my letter?” 

My mentor nodded gravely and his tone seemed to grow tense as he leaned in to speak. “The claims you make are great, and I am desperate. Can you please-”

It was then I embarrassingly let out a wet, hacking cough that resulted in something flying from my mouth. It landed on the floorboards of the front porch, and my cheeks grew red. 

“I’m so sorry-” I told them. “I picked something up on the road, it seems. I cannot begin to-”

“Hush, my boy!” The doctor took me by the shoulder and had me open my mouth. He examined the back of my throat and said, “As I suspected! An allergy attack. The pollen here is extreme most days. Oh, your poor throat must be writhing!” He pointed a finger back to the professor and wagged it at him. “We will discuss further over supper, Maxwell. Believe me when I say that not only are my claims true, but they are greater than you can even imagine. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a stew that I think our young friend will find most agreeable. Please, gentlemen. Inside!”

From there we were led inside the house. I can speak with certainty, now that it is daylight, but at the time I was perplexed with the house. Its interior was Victorian, with old gilded foil flaking off of the molding. There were glass display cases showing knives, pieces of pottery, and papers so old, I thought a mere glance could turn them to dust. The ceiling was high in the main hall, and I saw an open drawing room off to the side with lovely quilted armchairs. The walls were lined with books, which set my mind spinning with excitement. There was also a strange towering device made of glass and metal in the center of the table, but I did not recognize what it was. 

“This way, gentlemen,” he said, leading us to a door on the left. “I have much to discuss with you, and plenty of food for you to eat. Please!” 

As we entered the dining room, he gestured us to a set of chairs nestled into a fine mahogany table. In the center of its face, resting on a linen runner, there was a large silver dome covering a platter. From a china cabinet behind us, he nabbed another plate and bowl, along with an extra spoon. He sat them down in front of me with care.

“Gentlemen,” he said, gripping the top of the dome. “I give you a stew that will change your lives forever.” The professor laughed, but the doctor did not. I suppressed a cough, but Weber did not seem to notice as he turned to my mentor with a voracious eye. I half expected a reprimand, but instead:	“What ails you, Professor Maxwell?” The professor looked confused by the issue. “I say, what ails you? What causes you pain?”

“I’m afraid I don’t understand, Dr. Weber.”

“It is a simple enough question,” he said, brushing his mustache with a stubby hand. “Our young friend here, at the present, suffers from pains in the throat with no ready medicine for his condition. Therefore, I ask you, what is it that ails you?”

“Nothing in particular, sir.” At that, he flashed me a look of concern and amusement, almost as if he’d been stopped in the street by a crazed beggar. 

“We are all afflicted,” said the doctor. “Whether we admit it or not.”

“But I have no wounds!” 

There was a long stare between the two of them. The only movement in the room was the flickering of the candelabras and the trembling of a vase of tulips. Then, with an almost sinister flare, the doctor smiled. “Not all afflictions can be seen, and not all pains are wounds. Think of this as you eat, Herr Maxwell.”

He removed the cover and revealed a large bowl of amber stew, full of carrots, corn, potatoes and meat I believe was beef. He used a small ladle and filled our bowls, then exited the room briefly, leaving us alone with our food. Up close, it looked odd to me. Oil floated in the broth, and the vegetables looked as if they’d been submerged for a long while. It looked almost mushy when looking at it too long. I looked up to see the professor's reaction, but to my alarm he was staring at the bowl, wide eyed and troubled. 

Dr. Weber appeared with a  bottle of red wine, and exclaimed, “Multipulciano!” He had already uncorked the bottle and was generously filling our glasses as we sat. “I fell in love with this wine while studying in Italy. I bought enough to last a lifetime- though I hope I outlive the wine!” He laughed heartily, but by himself. Once he sat down, he gestured for us to eat, and reluctantly we did. 

I am astonished at how nervous I was at the time. I was merely eating soup, and yet I recall my hand trembling as I raised the spoon to my lips. Those first few seconds of taste were nonexistent as I slurped down the broth, but my senses were reawakened as I took in a flavor that reminded me of a soup from my childhood. My mother made a soup that tasted exactly like this, down to the spices she’d thrown in sometimes at random, but always tasting lovely. 

There was no doubt, despite my odd circumstances. This was my mother’s stew. How that could be, I had no idea, but it was. The only odd thing I found was that it was devoid of salt. For moments I would think that there was a hint somewhere, but for some reason I could tell there wasn’t. I looked up to ask the professor, expecting to interrupt his meal, but he was actually watching us. His bowl was as full as his smile, and he raised his eyebrows in delight as I asked him for a salt shaker. 

“Apologies,” he said, raising both hands in surrender, “but I’m afraid I don’t keep salt in the house. Sodium doesn’t like me, you understand.”  

I almost made a comment about how odd that was, and turned to see my professor's reaction, but he wasn’t listening. Instead, he was crying softly, his bearded face inches from the bowl. I saw a tear roll of his nose and drop into the soup.

“Professor Maxwell,” I asked, “are you okay?” 

“Of course he is,” answered the Doctor as he learned back in his carved chair. “He’s simply healing. Aren’t you, sir?” He looked up with a red face of astonishment. His wet cheeks were wiped by the sleeve of his jacket, and his smile was like that of a terminally ill man being told he was cured. 

“I don’t understand,” he said. “What is this doing to me?”

“I’d like to know the same!” I interjected, “This stew tastes… I mean it’s just like the one-”

“How is your throat, my young friend?” 

It was then I realized my throat was no longer in pain. I inhaled an incredulous breath and was shocked at the clarity of my throat. I couldn’t even muster a response before the Doctor interrupted again. 

“I imagine your neck must feel better too.” 

He was right about that as well. Any pains and aches from travel I held had vanished from my body. I was relaxed, somehow, and my muscles were invigorated. As I write this now, I find myself wondering:

Did I ever mention the pain in my neck?

If I did, I would have forgotten it. For now, I’ll chock up Weber’s comment to nothing more than observation. Still….

Without elaborating, the doctor stood to his feet and said, “My friends, please finish eating. I have a surprise in the drawing room for when you finish, but for now, eat. Eat, and be healed! There is still much to discuss before bed.”

And with that, he left us and we were left alone. I stared at my bowl for a second, trying to rationalize the flavors I tasted with what I saw, but was unsuccessful. I looked at Maxwell to find some kindred spirit, but it was useless. He was already pouring himself another bowl.",1,1752451339.0,u_Middle_Eye882,0,1.0,False
1lz7uer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lz7uer/review_yet_another_pineward_woody_sampler_set/,Review: Yet Another Pineward Woody Sampler Set,"When Pineward posted about its Woody Sampler set you bet your ass I RAN to order it. I find myself on something of a journey to try all of Pineward’s catalog, so I picked up a sample of Velvetine as well because I’ve heard good things. The notes on the 6-piece sampler set are deliberately vague but that’s okay because we like a challenge! Are these the newest bestest forest fragrances in the game? Let's find out:

**Lorien:** At the beginning of the pine/eucalyptus/moss situation I can smell each note loud and proud, and I like it. Tragically, over time the moss gradually comes to the front and overrides the other notes, while getting sweeter and sweeter. It’s not egregiously soapy, but it does smell like the gift shop adjacent to a large mansion that has been lovingly preserved by a historical society (e.g. Monticello). They always have some banging soaps and candles, but I don’t know that I want to walk around smelling like the Monticello Visitor’s Center and Gift Shop. I feel like my mother in law would though… ***Notes:*** *pine, eucalyptus, moss*

**Faun Forest:** All the reviews I’ve seen for this so far have been something along the lines of “fruit! I’m getting fruit! Look at this FRUIT!” and I’m over here smelling tomato leaf and rhubarb, like Chevalier Vert’s well-behaved sister. I’m not complaining, but I’m really curious why I’m not getting any of the alleged fruit? It does get sweeter and perhaps fruitier in the dry down, but this is very green to me and not what I expected from the notes. Fruit or no fruit, this is very clean, light, and well-balanced, but one of the weakest scents on my skin. ***Notes:*** *pomegranate, blackberry, fir* 8/10

**Bear:** I can tell you right now that this is going to be a winner. It’s dry, dry, dry sweet cedar and a bit of green pine. Almost immediately I realized that I love this because it is SO similar to Woodcut by Olympic Orchids. It’s a little more rounded and not quite as sweet or “loud” but, there are obvious similarities in the pure, warm, sugared, dusty cedar note. Woodcut is still first in my heart, but this is very nice and I’m sure will be a crowd pleaser. ***Notes:*** *Cedar, chaparral, pinyon* 8.5/10

**Northwild:** The opening pine note is rich and absolutely delightful.  It fades rather quickly though into a lavender situation with something that smells almost like vanilla or beeswax in the background. The moss doesn’t go soap-adjacent like in Lorien, but it does take on an expensive lotion quality, probably because of the lavender. By any yardstick it’s perfectly acceptable, but doesn’t spark joy for me in the dry down. ***Notes:*** *lavender, fir, moss* 6.5/10

**Holy Cross:**  While wet, there’s something distinctly herbaceous and green with a sweet undertone. If I was sniffing this blind I would’ve guessed this had the fruity notes of Faun Forest because it smelled a bit like raspberries and licorice for one shining moment. It dried down to a bluebell note that I recognize from Jo Malone’s Wild Bluebell, but this is softer, mossier, and greener. It eventually ends up in a place of “clean laundry,” all light and airy and gentle but with 10+ hours of longevity. The “clean laundry” scents usually smell like detergent to me, but this actually does smell like clean laundry; gently floral, comforting, linen-like. This is basically an ad for the ‘90’s complete with a tire swing and a cotton dress during golden hour. ***Notes:*** *bluebell, watercress, lichen* 7.5/10

**Mournhold:** I swear to God on paper this smelled like a rawhide dog treat. I didn’t want to test on my skin but I was brave and did it anyway, and found it to be very stanky with notes of bitter black coffee and…smoke? Or maybe that’s just the leather. I think the leather and coffee are really a bad combo for my nose. In Funerie the leather note smelled like burned hair and this is also pretty bad. My husband said this smelled like “gravel.”  This is unexpectedly abrasive and odd. ***Notes***: *coffee, leather, fir*  3/10

**Velvetine (Regular Catalog)**: Okay, I know that logically this is supposed to smell like clove and vanilla or whatever, but for all the world this smells like root beer to me. Root beer and a tiny bit of bubblegum. My husband said it smelled “like cinnamon” and after I pressed him for a bit admitted that it might also smell like Dr. Pepper. Once I read the notes and picked out the clove it started to make sense, and I enjoyed how the vanilla and sandalwood notes really bloomed on my skin on the dry down. I don’t get any pine in this and I don’t feel like it’s particularly “me” but I think it’s a lovely scent nonetheless. ***Notes***: *Notes: ambergris, cypress, vanilla, clove, labdanum, fir, dragon’s blood resin, sandalwood, tonkin musk, vintage Mousse de Saxe amber base.* 7/10

Well folks this was another strong showing from Pineward, but it didn't knock my socks off like the [summer sampler set](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1kod6cc/review_pineward_summer_sampler/) and I don't think I'll be putting any of these on my FS wishlist for one reason or another. I do have samples of Gellato, Alfiryn, Autumnal, and Shire in the mail, so expect another mini review soon.

I've been single for a while after coming out of a 7 year long relationship. While I'm not looking for romance, I do miss the closeness, care and daily connection that comes with deep companionship. That's what I'm hoping to find here with you. A genuine friendship with someone who's maybe a little needy, a little silly, and looking for a safe, steady presence in their life. If you're looking for that kind of bond too, then maybe we're what each other needs.

I know this kind of connection isn’t what everyone’s looking for. But for me, I’m drawn to something a little more nurturing, a little more emotionally invested.

I'm like an onion. There's layers. Just try not to cry while you peel them back to discover what lays deep within. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. Same goes for my toast. I draw the line at crumpets though.

A little about me:

* Recently started the gym. Please remind me to go, I'll pretend to grumble but secretly love it.
* I cycle, hike, and occasionally socialise with the other unlucky sods I call friends.
* I'm considering starting rock climbing/bouldering. I can't wait to grab the first two holds and re-evaluate my life choices
* Big metalhead - You'll find me at Bloodstock this year (yes, I've already got the tickets!)
* Currently playing Satisfactory, but I've been known to disappear into OldSchool RuneScape and reappear 6 months later.
* I’m building an indie Android game and trying not to lose my mind doing it. Code is pain.
* I have a 6-year-old daughter who’s a huge part of my world. Who would have thought, me? A father?! Somehow she makes me feels like I've got half a clue what I'm doing... She's my tiny chaos goblin and I wouldn't change any of it.

Looking for:

* Age 21- 40. Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
* Soft, silly, clingy, or chaotic in the best ways
* Up for regular chatting. I work a crazy schedule so timezones don't matter much. I'm around at stupid o'clock every day.
* We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
* Willing to share their day, their weird thoughts, and maybe trauma-dump just a little
* Happy to build a bond that feels comforting, consistent, and meaningful

I work at a 5-star Marriott property, and something that consistently undermines the ambiance and guest experience is when early arrivals who sometimes show up as early as 8–9 AM, end up sleeping in the lobby while waiting for their room to be ready. Whether the lobby is open and active or during off-hours when it’s closed, it really clashes with the high-end atmosphere we aim to maintain, especially with guests and VIPs walking through on their way to breakfast…

Check-in is clearly stated as 3 PM. I totally understand arriving early and dropping off bags, freshening up, or grabbing a coffee, but sprawling out half-asleep in armchairs or couches for hours feels inappropriate for a setting like this. Why do some people not plan better or at least keep themselves busy respectfully until check-in?

Is this a common issue at other luxury properties too? How do your teams handle it without sounding inhospitable? ",0,1752451116.0,marriott,26,0.33,False

1lz7peh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1lz7peh/30m_ukonline_on_the_search_for_something/,30/M - UK/Online - On the search for something... meaningful?,"Ello ello, I'm Lewis! A 30 year old lanky brit on the search for something meaningful.

I've been single for a while after coming out of a 7 year long relationship. While I'm not looking for romance, I do miss the closeness, care and daily connection that comes with deep companionship. That's what I'm hoping to find here with you. A genuine friendship with someone who's maybe a little needy, a little silly, and looking for a safe, steady presence in their life. If you're looking for that kind of bond too, then maybe we're what each other needs.

I know this kind of connection isn’t what everyone’s looking for. But for me, I’m drawn to something a little more nurturing, a little more emotionally invested.

I'm like an onion. There's layers. Just try not to cry while you peel them back to discover what lays deep within. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. Same goes for my toast. I draw the line at crumpets though.

A little about me:

* Recently started the gym. Please remind me to go, I'll pretend to grumble but secretly love it.
*  I cycle, hike, and occasionally socialise with the other unlucky sods I call friends.
* I'm considering starting rock climbing/bouldering. I can't wait to grab the first two holds and re-evaluate my life choices
* Big metalhead - You'll find me at Bloodstock this year (yes, I've already got the tickets!)
* Currently playing Satisfactory, but I've been known to disappear into OldSchool RuneScape and reappear 6 months later.
* I’m building an indie Android game and trying not to lose my mind doing it. Code is pain.
* I have a 6-year-old daughter who’s a huge part of my world. Who would have thought, me? A father?! Somehow she makes me feels like I've got half a clue what I'm doing... She's my tiny chaos goblin and I wouldn't change any of it.

Looking for:

* Age 21- 40. Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
* Soft, silly, clingy, or chaotic in the best ways
* Up for regular chatting. I work a crazy schedule so timezones don't matter much. I'm around at stupid o'clock every day.
* We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
* Willing to share their day, their weird thoughts, and maybe trauma-dump just a little
* Happy to build a bond that feels comforting, consistent, and meaningful

If any of this speaks to you, drop me a message. Photos are welcome but not required. Just be yourself and let’s see where it goes.",1,1752450904.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1lz7ozp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lz7ozp/aita_my_wife_was_upset_i_woke_her_up_to_let_her/,AITA - My wife was upset I woke her up to let her know i was going to the doctors.,"For the last few days my eye has been swelling. It started light and this morning I woke up and it was painful and swollen larger than the day before. Google researching more said that it could be a stye, or an infection and that there is an infection that is quite bad... Orbital Cellulitis. Since I had JUST gone to get my eyes checked and they used eye drops (which i am assuming they didn't clean). I got kind of worried this morning at 7:30am over coffee. Now to add to all this my parents are in town, so my mom is still upstairs sleeping and I am sitting on the patio with my dad having a coffee.

Being in Canada all walk-in clinics are closed on Sunday. So I decided ""I guess I have to go to the ER to get it looked at? If i have to get a prescription."". 

My wife was still sleeping, but I felt I should let her know that my eye isn't looking too good and I am going to head to an ER (since I was hoping that going to the ER ASAP would make it faster to get in and out). So I very gently wake her and say in a whisper, ""I am going to head to the doc, my eye is pretty bad."" 

She was kind of frustrated and said ""ok."" and layed back down.

I went down stairs and finished my coffee before heading out, chatted about what I was going to do with my dad, and prepared to leave. I got a text from her 

""I know pharmacists can prescribe for smaller things, if you cant get into a walk in.""

I thought, oh! that's a good idea. I will chill for an hour when the pharmacy opens and go. So I keep sitting on the patio to finish the coffee and wait for the time to head to the pharmacy.

About 10 mins later, my wife comes out on the patio and instantly says ""You know, you shouldn't have woken me up. I wanted to sleep more."" in a pretty confrontational ""how dare you"" way in front of myself and my dad.

No ""How are you doing?"", no checking in my well being, no empathy. just... fuck you for waking me up early (at 7:20am)

So at this point I go in the house and she proceeds to lecture me on how she is on her period and needs sleep. She had a rough night (cramps) and that I shouldn't have woken her up, I should have just texted and left.

My argument was that i totally GET that, but I kind of am worried I have a bad eye infection and wanted to let her know I was GOING TO SEEK treatment. and to ME she should have been like ""How are you doing? how are you feeling? is everything alright?""

She maintains that I should have never woke her up, and that i was the asshole and that she is not in the wrong at all for being more worried about her sleep than my situation.

\*mind you, I haven't had eye issues in 30 years... so this is ALL new to me.

I ended up going to 2 pharmacists who both came back with that its more than likely a stye and that a hot compress is all that's needed. 

And she is still pissed at me and refuses to see how I see her actions as selfish and that I shouldn't be made an asshole for waking her up. ",56,1752450871.0,AmItheAsshole,115,0.76,False

# Zones

**List of zones**

-BirchForest

-DeepForest

-FarmLand

-Roads

-Forest

-Organic Forest

-Managed Forest

-Primary Forest

-Urban

-TrailerPark

-Vegitation

- ***Any NUMBER i list after an ZONE is how many rolls the game will give for that specific catagory.***
 For example: Roads 3 under the **Animal** catagory means the game will roll 3 times give or take for the **Animal** catagory.


When foraging you have many different factors when it comes to what type of item you find. One of said factors is the ***Zone*** you are searching.
Each zone has an ammount of times it will roll for a item catagory. For example, If you are searching in the **BirchForest** zone, The game will roll 3 times for the catagory of Dead Animals.
If it rolls for a dead animal you will find something from the dead animal catagory. ***Please keep in mind this is a simplified explanation of my understanding of how it works, there is many other factors that effect your ""rolls"". I also only have a basic knowledge of reading game code so take all of this with a grain of salt. i am sure some big brain wizard will come in here and correct any mistakes i made.***


Some of the variables that effect how many ""rolls"" you get for each catagory:

 
- **Foraging level**
 Some items mainly food related items such as fruit and herbs etc will ***not*** spawn unless you have reached a certain foraging level.

- **How many days have been survived**

- **Weather**
 Rain and snow can give an increased *OR* decrease in your chance of finding a certain item

- **Time of day**
 Some items such as worms for example you have a *significantly* higher chance of rolling at night time according to the games code.

- **Characters and traits**
 Some traits and characters give bonuses to your chance of finding certain items in different catagories.

- **What time of the year it is**
 Some items do ***not*** spawn during certain months of the year, while some items have an ***increased*** chance of spawning during a certain time of the year. most of these items are food and animal related items.

## Categories

- Categories get a certain number of rolls as default but it is also infuenced depending on diferent factors listed above.

- Some categories also have sub categories. For example,
 The weapons category has three sub categories: Uncommen, Rare, And Legendary. Each sub category gets a certain number of rolls. The uncommon sub category gets the most rolls while the legendary sub category only gets a single roll.
 
***Below is a list of all the items that can be found in their corresponding category and also which zones give the most and least amount of rolls.***

1lz7miu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lz7miu,Arma Reforger Halo Mil Sim [UNSC New Horizon],"Hello I’m MSgt. Coffee NCOIC (non commissioned officer in command) of the Marines branch in an Arma Reforger Halo Mil Sim known as “UNSC New Horizon”. We are a semi serious Mil Sim but focus more on having a good time. We’re a smaller name in a larger pond. We’re trying to recruit more players to come and join our community. We’d like to grow our population to add more organizations to our sim and bring larger scale and more fun experiences. In New Horizon we welcome players of all kinds and we understand that it takes a gathering of people to build a community and that those in charge are merely representatives of the people in that community. If you’re looking for a new Halo Mil Sim to call home or looking for your first unit in the game then UNSC New Horizon is a great fresh start. We welcome all with open arms. Come and join UNSC New Horizon today! Here’s our discord link and check out the photos in full view!

Okay so I have been absolutely bum rushed by folks since updating my profile with all of your amazing advice, seriously thank you, but there's been some strange little birds who tiptoed into the aviary. One of them got a little too close to to plucking my own feathers. 

Met a guy, it was seeming okay, set up the m&g, super casual and low pressure, chill vibes. Dude wasn't even slightly the guy he claimed to be on SA. I had asked for a selfie and got one. It looked legit.

To avoid this in the future, I'm trying to come up with some strategies and tactics from reading through the previous posts here on the subject but wanted to run this past you lovely people before deploying any of these.

SD's are you comfortable with, or would be open to a zoom coffee date before a formal m&g to make sure folks are who they say they are?

And/or what would be a way that, as an SD, be something you'd find non offensive or acceptable? 

Obviously scammers are a thing and not really avoidable. But if any of the lads have a few mins to weigh in, I'd appreciate it.

I'm going to be returning to work part time and I'm supposed to be giving my employer my availability next week, but this was all hinging on obtaining care.

I've posted on 3 FB groups, bought care premium, and tried nanny lane with no success. I've had everyone from care.com ghost me for a meet and greet call, and one person turned down the job because she didn't see in my advertisement that we have a 3 story townhouse.

In the FB groups, all have ghosted and one showed up for a trial day and then ghosted after, but this also was arranged without an intro call. I did talk to the girl who came for a trial day a lot, mostly because it felt weird just throwing My baby to a random person who showed up in my home without any kind of knowing each other, but she also seemed hesitant to let baby chill on the floor or use the bouncer to take a bathroom break and I feel like I should have said something or maybe I gave off the vibe that I wouldn't be okay with that. She's also just not available for the ongoing job until September so it felt like a waste of time.

I was hoping to have something ongoing established before I start working because we moved from a 4000 sqft house to a 2500 sq ft townhouse so naturally I have a lot of cleaning and purging I need to get done that I can't get done with a baby. 

This was in my advertisement:

Schedule:  
- Caretaker's choice between 4 hours in the morning or 4 hours in the afternoon, Monday through Friday  
- Government Holidays off  

Amenities:  
- Use of snacks and coffee machine, free to use kitchen and bring food/use fridge  
- Two baby areas, free to use both  
- Use of carriers and baby bouncer 

Responsibilities:  
- Watch over my son? I have books, toys, not too strict about phone use, if he's sleeping I don't care otherwise if it's a text here or there NBD; it's a part time gig so I'm really not expecting perfection.  
- Diaper changes  
- naps  
- Feeding and cleaning bottles  
- No laundry, baths, or cleaning up, I don't mind doing that myself later.  

Pay:  
I've been defaulting to requested rates but advertised $20+ per hour; I haven't had anyone request more than $28/hr and I entertained this person actually, she was my favorite but is unable to go up stairs due to her knees so I'm not sure if my rate is just low, but it didn't seem like anyone requested anything significantly higher.

I don't know if it being a townhouse is a red flag or me working from home/being home is a red flag or what. My work schedule is also probably not going to take up all the time I'm hiring for either due to the nature of my job. (consulting) 

In my head I thought maybe having an introduction call, having a trial day, and then ramping up to 5 half days a week while checking references and signing up for Poppins would be an appropriate route but I haven't been able to get that far. I'm new to all this and I'm all ears on what I could be doing wrong.

Edit: thanks for the input so far. I'm sorry I posted without reading the wiki that apparently exists and sounds like it gets updated, I will go check that out. Sometimes when I go to a new subreddit, the info is outdated and it's my fault that I didn't check. I'm coming to the understanding that I should be offering a higher wage, guaranteed hours, and PTO, and perhaps even moving my WFH desk. The wage I was offering was based off me seeing what people seemed to be receptive to in the FB groups I was in, but maybe it's possible that was even too low. I really appreciate everyone being patient with me. I'm totally new to all this and I don't know what I don't know. I left a bunch of comments in here, some smarter than others by the looks of the downvotes, and I'm sorry if I'm really that big of an idiot that my comments deserve to be downvoted that hard.

But since 16, when I started to work in another country (I'm 18 now) I can't really sleep. Yes, stress, difficulty with language barrier, family problems, finance problems, always up and trying to be everywhere in time, scared of messing something up, clung to people's opinions and etc!
I guess this could be the cause of my insomnia problem. Mostly I have it on Sunday evening - night. Terrible, exactly right now.
I work two shifts: one week from 06:00 till 15:00 (sometimes overtime), second week from 15:00 till 23:45 or possible overtime till 1-4 am. The problem is, I absolutely can't manage with the time. Every weekend after working morning shift I go home, shower take my stuff and go to the train station having a 3 hour trip to my boyfriend. On Monday few hours before work I come back to my city. After night shift he picks me up on Saturday and we are going to his place, next day evening I'm coming back home.
I know how messy it looks, but only with him I sleep like a child and sometimes even more than 8 hours.

So I just can't figure out. When should I go to sleep, when should I wake up? How to force myself? I am not drinking energy drinks. And I drink coffee VERY rarely, maybe 3-4 times a week, one time in the morning for a whole day.
So what is actually wrong? Which pills should I try? Mediation not helping. Music not helping. Cartoons, movies, series not helping. Reading not helping. Milk not helping. Praying not helping. Exercises not helping.

and the worst thing is if I get less than 8 hours of sleep - I can barely walk. And if I get more than 8 or exactly 8, I feel like I slept too much and my brain is dead!

Little by slowly I have to change my habits and my mentality and start thinking of others and how I can be a little bit more thoughtful and buying them coffee or something to eat.
Before I was so opposed to that because it meant that I was using my own money and that meant less to go to the casino with.
Gambling really distorts our thinking and it is extremely self-centered self-focused for the wrong things. It is extremely grandiose and childish to think that if I'm just smart enough I can make easy money and live an easy life. One day at a time we have to break out of that thinking and realize and accept that life doesn't work that way. I've neglected every other part of my life because my main focus was on paying my bills and having enough to gamble with.
I stopped buying running shoes closing and even getting car washes because all of that money I was supposedly saving was so that I could pay off debt and hopefully gamble more.

1lz76qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lz76qw/restaurant_der_schwarze_hof_a_deal_under_the_full/,"Restaurant ""Der schwarze Hof"" – A Deal under the Full Moon","“**We all have desires we want fulfilled,**” said the man in the dark coat on the other side of the table, smiling broadly and baring his teeth like an animal.  
  
“But the question is: can you afford the price, Mr. Klein?”   
  
Markus Klein sat opposite him in a small, old-fashioned German restaurant called *Der schwarze Hof*. The tables were solid wood, there were benches instead of cheap chairs, and the walls were decorated with antique photos and traditional motifs. He himself was an average man in every way. He had come here because of an ad in a free newspaper – how quaint – which read:

**Do you want your desires and longings fulfilled? Come to “Der schwarze Hof” on a full moon night.**

It was a Wednesday evening. Tonight was a full moon. He had come to *Der schwarze Hof* expecting a prank or some new-age nonsense. But something about the man calling himself *Mr. Meister* made him feel that this wasn't a joke – and that unsettled him.

“You haven’t even asked me what I want, yet you’re already talking about the price. That’s... odd,” said Markus, gathering all his courage. He normally wasn’t assertive in conversations, but tonight something was different.

Mr. Meister rolled his eyes.  
“It’s always the same things... Passion. Lust. Money. Power. Fame. A little ego boost. If they’re feeling extra dramatic, they ask for revenge. So what is it that you want?”

Markus swallowed.  
“I don’t have much money. And women... haven’t worked out for me.”

Mr. Meister smiled again, exposing his teeth. “The usual, then. I figured.”

“What do I have to pay to get what I want?” Markus still wasn’t sure. Was this some kind of life coaching session? Or something much darker?

“You want the standard ‘get the girl and the money’ package. No problem. I can give you that.”

“How does it work?”

“You pay the price, and the doors that lead you to your desires will open. Others will close.”

“So it’s one of those new age 'manifest your future' scams?”

“You’re a skeptic. I know the type. Okay... how about the waitress?”

“She’s over 30 and has tattoos which is not to my liking and—”

“This is just a test run. Besides, let’s not pretend it hasn’t been ten years since you’ve been with *any* woman, Mr. Klein. And don’t bother denying it to protect your poor little ego. We both know it’s true.”

Markus swallowed his pride. “Okay, so how does it work?”

“She’ll come to your table shortly. Just say to her, ‘Give me your number. Tomorrow you’ll come to my place. I’ll text you the address.’”

“That’s the big magic? Cold-approaching aging waitresses? You probably paid her to play along.”

“It’s only a demo. We can pick someone else if you prefer... Choose.”

Markus looked around. At a nearby table sat what looked like a mother with her daughter. The mother was maybe fifty, the daughter half that. Both attractive – the daughter as you’d expect, the mother surprisingly well kept.

“How about them? I want to seduce both.”

Mr. Meister smiled broadly again.  
“Alright. Here’s your free sample.”  
He reached out and touched Markus’s forehead between the eyes.

A chill surged into Markus’s skull like ice water.  
“What’s happening?” he gasped, paralyzed, drawing in a sharp breath.

Mr. Meister stood up and leaned toward him as he made for the exit.  
“Go talk to them. Focus on what you want. No half measures.”  
  
Then he smiled again. “If you’ve got the balls – in every sense of the word – we’ll see each other again on the next full moon. I can give you much more. No need to be shy.”

And with that, he left the restaurant. For a moment, it seemed like his shadow lingered, even though he was already gone.

Markus could move again. The icy feeling faded, but he felt clear-headed. Focused.  
“What a waste of time,” he thought. “Or maybe not?”

He looked at the mother and daughter. Took one last sip of coffee, left some money on the table, and walked toward the exit. As he passed their table, the younger woman made brief eye contact. He didn’t know why, but he greeted her and started a conversation.

Nothing dramatic happened – except that it *worked*.  
He said all the right things. Showed interest when they spoke. Didn’t flinch when they tested him. Flirted when it fit. Pulled back when it didn’t.   
  
By the end of the night, he took them both home. He never saw them again. Whatever spell had turned the frog into a prince lasted just one night.

But Markus Klein was sure of one thing:  
  
**He wanted more.**   
  
Markus had plenty of time to think over the following thirty days.  
He remembered his last girlfriend – how she’d called him “boring, average, and broke.” And those were her nicer insults. The rest he preferred not to remember.

He didn’t have a big car, but he didn’t need one. Why *did* it have to be big? He never understood that.  
Why wasn’t he allowed to want beautiful children? Since when did every man have to be a Dubai prince to earn respect?

He didn’t want that. But he also couldn’t deny that without it, **no one** respected him. Not the men. Not the women.

There seemed to be only one way to get what he wanted.

He would return to *Der schwarze Hof*.  
  
On the next full moon.

  
**Markus was one of the first guests that night.**  
  
To his disappointment, he didn’t see Mr. Meister anywhere as he entered. Had he missed his chance?

He sat at the same table where they’d met last time. Out of boredom, he ordered some food – goulash with noodles in a dark sauce. Technically Hungarian, but now a staple of German cuisine.

As he ate, a man suddenly grabbed him by the shoulder. He looked exhausted – wearing a stylish coat and expensive shoes, but he smelled bad and his hair was greasy.

“Are you here for Mr. Meister?”

Markus didn’t reply, just looked at him in confusion. The man sat down uninvited.

“I know that look. You want to make a deal. But don’t. You shouldn’t.”

Markus was intrigued. Was this some kind of review from a previous customer?

“Why not? Because he’ll scam me?”

“No. Because he’ll give you *everything* he promises.”

Markus stared into the man’s eyes.  
For a moment, the lights flickered – or did he imagine it?  
Next to their table, Mr. Meister stood silently, as if he had materialized.

“Good evening, Mr. Klein,” he said with a smile. Then, after a pause:  
“Good evening, Mr. Heid. Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be at your company? Or with your family? One of the two families, I mean.”

“I want to end the contract.”

“You know that’s not possible.”

Heid held up a document.  
“Take it back. Release me from the curse.”

“I gave you what you wanted,” said Mr. Meister kindly. Then, without warning, his tone darkened. He lowered his head, and the shadow of his hat fell across his eyes, which now seemed dull yet piercing.

“And *you will pay*.”

“I don’t want this anymore.”

“We can discuss that at the next full moon. But as you can see, Mr. Heid – I have a client here. Now please: *leave.*”

There was something strange in how those words were spoken – so compelling it almost felt magical.

Heid stood up and stormed out of the restaurant, clutching the paper tightly to his chest.  
Were those tears in his eyes?

Mr.Meister sat down and smiled again, waving to the waitress.  
“The usual, please.”

“Coming right up,” she replied.

Markus kept eating, though he couldn’t help noticing how Mr. Meister watched him the entire time with that sharp, stone-faced expression.

When the coffee came, Mr. Meister added milk and stirred slowly, lost in thought.

“I’m sorry you had to witness that. Some people get second thoughts after using our services. Which is, of course, unacceptable. There are no refunds. A deal is a deal. Do you find that unfair?”

Markus swallowed his last bite.  
“Not really.”

There it was again – that broad smile.  
“I see you’re a man with a solid moral compass when it comes to business. Very good.”

He sipped his coffee.  
“So... did you enjoy it?”

Markus blushed.  
“Wow, well, I mean, how should I describe it? We—”

“I didn’t ask what you *did*,” interrupted Mr. Meister, slightly annoyed. “I asked whether you *enjoyed* it.”

Markus sensed the irritation and quickly replied what he thought the man wanted to hear.  
“Yes. It was wonderful.”

“Would you like more?”

“Yes... but what about Mr. Heid?”

“What about him?” Mr. Meister replied coldly, taking another sip.

“He said I shouldn’t go through with the deal.”

“Why not trust your own intuition? A sheep shouldn’t advise a lion, should it?” he said with honest admiration.

“That’s true, but what if the deal is bad for me...?”

“Bad is what *feels* bad. You came here because your life felt bad, didn’t you? Because you wanted – *more*?”

Markus looked at him. Then, in a whisper:  
“What do I have to do?”

“Now we’re getting to the heart of the matter,” said Mr. Meister, fixing his gaze on Markus’s eyes.  
“All you need to do is sign this contract. Twice. Then live your life – with just two things in mind:  
  
**Money. And women.**  
  
That’s it.”

Suddenly a contract lay on the table.  
“Where did it come from?” he thought. “Doesn’t matter.”

He read it.

**“Mr. Markus Klein shall be granted the ability to seduce any woman he desires, except those currently claimed by other pact partners or who are themselves pact partners. He shall also gain the means to acquire, through luck and effort, no less than five million euros per year.”**

“F-F-Five million?” Markus stammered. “*EVERY YEAR?!*”

“Not enough?” Herr Meister yawned. “We can write ten.”

“W-what?! ten million?!” Markus was flabbergasted. 

“You’re tough to impress, Mr. Klein. Fine. Fifty it is. But I can’t go higher.”

The number changed on the paper.

“What is *this?!*” Markus jumped up.

“That’s power. Or magic. Or a miracle – whichever you prefer.”

After a short moment of hesitation he sat back down and drank the last of his coffee.

Then Markus read the last line:

**“In return, Mr. Markus Klein shall surrender his soul to Mr. Meister upon death.”**

“So it *is* one of those soul-selling devil contracts. That’s just movie stuff. It’s not real.”

“But what you did with those women felt real, didn’t it?”

Markus said nothing.

Mr. Meister handed him a pen.

“A pen? Shouldn’t there be blood or something?”

“That’s old-fashioned. We’ll probably move to digital contracts and AI soon. Much more efficient.”

Markus stared at the contract. Thoughts ran wild in his mind. Contradictory. Disordered.

What if it worked? What if it really made him rich?  
But what if it *really* cost him his soul?

He set the pen down.

“I don’t think I can do it,” he said, looking Mr. Meister straight in the eye, surprised by his own courage.

But deep inside, he feared the man’s reaction.

“I understand completely. That’s perfectly fine.”

“Really?”

“Yes, really. I mean, you had a good night. And it seems like you don’t need much love or money to function.   
  
You’ve probably had enough now – for the next **ten years**.”  
  
His tone was calm, but something cold lay underneath.

Markus grabbed his jacket. He hesitated.

*Was this the chance of a lifetime he was walking away from?* he wondered.

As he stood, Mr. Meister subtly pointed at another table.

A stunning young woman sat there. Blonde, long hair. A natural beauty. Maybe twenty, twenty-five max. Not like all those tattooed modern women you see all day long on social media which were not to Markus liking.

“Do you want to start a family with her?” Mr. Meister asked. “Or just one night?"" He paused a moment ""Your children with her would be beautiful, I’m sure.”

Something stirred inside Markus. A hunger. A gnawing emptiness.

*Is this really all there is?*

He felt like he wasn’t thinking anymore – only acting on instinct.

He turned back and picked up the pen.

By the time he came back to his senses, his name was on the paper.

“Twice, please,” said Herr Meister and produced a second copy from under the first – completely emotionless.

Markus hesitated briefly.  
He had already signed.  
Surely the second signature was just a formality.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

“It’s funny,” Herr Meister said, rising from his chair.  
“The first signature is the hardest to get.  
But the second... that’s the one that *matters*. Without both - there is no contract.""

“It was a pleasure doing business with you. Enjoy your life.  
You won’t like what comes after.”

He took the contracts.

“Hm. This one’s for me. The one with the quote is yours.”

“Quote?”

“It doesn’t mean much. My employer just thinks it’s amusing to put one on the customer’s copy.  
Good evening. And have a beautiful life.”

He walked away.

A cold shiver ran down Markus’s back.

The icy feeling returned – this time deeper.  
It spread through his body.

He felt wide awake. Powerful.  
But also strangely lifeless.

He looked over at the young woman at the nearby table.

Whatever deal he had made tonight –  
he would make the most of it.   
  
**Death?**  
  
That was far off in the future.

He had chosen the here and now.

He stood up to approach her – but paused and glanced once more at the contract.

At the bottom, printed in small type, was a single line of scripture.  


**Matthew 16:26** *“What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?”*

When did it start working for you?


I started Trintellix at 5 mg the first week of May and then went up to 10 mg the first week of June. It’s now July 12th, so I’ve been on it for about 10 weeks total, and 5–6 weeks at the higher dose.

I really wanted to give this med a fair chance, so I quit drinking (moderately), smoking weed, and even stopped coffee a week ago — hoping it would help. But ever since I made those changes, the brain fog/motivation/cognitive issues have actually gotten worse. I feel like a shell of a human. 

I also stopped a bunch of other meds in May, so maybe my body is still adjusting. But right now, I’m really struggling with day-to-day life. I used to be very smart and take interest in things before all the meds, but on Trintellix, it feels like my brain just won’t turn on. Even writing this post is hard for me, and that’s not normal. 

I’ve had success with Prozac in the past, but it eventually stopped working, and have tried many meds since without success. Mainly because the onboarding sucks and I don’t see benefits in the first 1-2 months. I feel so lost on what to do. 

I’ve heard you’re supposed to wait 8–12 weeks for trintellix, and I’m around week 10 on 10 mg— but I honestly don’t know if I should keep pushing through or stop.

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!

1lz6yap,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lz6yap,"UPDATE 1.7.8!!! (FREE octopus skin, increased ice amounts,  UI change, and more!)","  
My personal feedback:  
  
Im happy theyre increasing the percentages for the shaved ice and also lowering the cooldown for collecting it from the statues. Before it felt like you did not get very much and i cant tell you how many times ive failed the 50% nearly 12+ times in a ROW. it gets frusterating so hopefully this will happen a little less. The honor system too with the wheel is a nice addition and a great way to help with progression and the rewards are (for the most part) charitable.  
  
The new UI isnt.. bad.. but it does still feel extremely congested. I feel like they could have put things under one menu  to click on, just like how they added the green 3 dots on the side that opens up and shows several different things in a very clean way. i feel aswell that the selling at the bottom wasnt a nessessary addition as all it does is delay the selling untill the whole bar is filled up vs autoselling like before. The only bonus i see from it is knowing how much each sells for so if you're trying to grind money and you're manually selecting the things to be made it helps you find out which product sells for the most.  
  
WOOO FREE OCTOPUS SKIN!!! ITS BASIC BUT CUTE AS HECK :D

That is all! Let me know what you guys think aswell c:

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",3,1752448781.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1lz6y1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1lz6y1b/seashore_76_713_review/,Seashore 7/6 -7/13 “Review”,"Just got back from our second trip on the Seashore and our fourth trip with MSC. Our crew was my wife and I (49) and our 14 & 17 yo daughters this week. 
High level view-MSC remains consistently inconsistent. I don’t suggest MSC to friends or family because I don’t want to held responsible, but for those of us who can roll with the occasional letdowns MSC remains a mostly fun ride. 
Cabin-stayed in Aurea Grand Suite 9001. The cabin was great for the four except there was a LOT of mechanical noise at docking times being the most forward cabin on the ship.  I would stay in this class again but would recommend against 9001. 
Entertainment-MSC is trying but the big stage performers still aren’t great and the shows remain a bit strange. Lots of the music around the ship remains essentially karaoke. They really could do better-every other line we have travelled with beats MSC entertainment. The highlight of the week remains the crew talent show. 
Crew-98% excellent and 2% WTF? We love the MSC crew and I like that if you pay attention you will see some of them around the ship having a cup of coffee or just taking a rest-we are their guests but they are people too. Occasionally things go right off the rail but we don’t allow the letdowns ruin our day, it’s MSC, we just roll with it. 
Food-the Aurea dining room was….very good and service was excellent. Food has improved since our last trip and we had some of the best cruise food we’ve had. It’s still mass market and made in a giant kitchen but most of it was tasty and fresh. I suspect the Aurea dining room might get a little more attention to detail because of our four trips with MSC this was by far the best except-the sweets. Not sure why this area has suffered but deserts just weren’t as good as they used to be. It was fine and I’m always happy to have a bowl of ice cream which was always fine. 
We made two trips to the main dining room for brunch. The first day was delicious and service was spot on. Day two-service was bad, food was edible but nowhere near as good as day one. Didn’t ruin our day, just moved on. 
The buffet-was decent. There were a few things that were bad (Italians shouldn’t do burgers) but overall most everything was good and some things were very good. There was always a solid variety and I can’t imagine anyone being so picky they can’t find something to enjoy. 

Aurea Experience-doesn’t mean much other than access to the dining room which again was great. The coffee maker in the room was a great perk. The prosecco showed up as promised but the other benefits-mostly ignored by the crew or not really a benefit. Check in lines were short. Priority port access wasn’t really needed although this might be a benefit in tender ports. Room didn’t have a “pillow menu” or any additional bath products other than the regular shower gel and shampoo.. Got chocolates at turn down the first night and not again. The room Stewart was great but didn’t have any of the additional items available to give even after we directly asked. He said he spoke to his supervisor and they “don’t have them.” No big deal but the promised perks weren’t available. The mini fridge perk-LOL, there were two beers, two sodas and two waters? We had the drink package so who cares but is that what “premium mini fridge/no charge for the first items” means? 
Again, consistently inconsistent. 
It was a good trip and we had fun. We’ve sailed with MSC, Carnival, HAL, Celebrity and NCL. I’d get on a MSC boat again tomorrow without hesitation. Always happy to be onboard. Go ahead and give them a try-just don’t let the little things ruin your day. Most things just aren’t that important. 

I’m tired, can’t think quite right today…I’ll add as I think of more. Happy sailing!

Oh that shit's so good. It's so so good. When I get on social media, I do it so I can look at people whose ego and lack of self-awareness cause them to behave in a way that makes me cringe and then smile. I feel a little bad for not caring too too much about their overall well-being. But then, I have plenty of care going in other directions for people who don't seem like scumbags.

I just found this Instagram account where a guy seems to have cheated on his wife. Now she's leaving him. As a result, he has started this new Instagram account where he's just posting constantly. It's so fucking pathetic–groveling and baiting for pity that never arrives. That shit's so good–keep embarrassing yourself, buddy. Someday she may just look back on it and thank you for revealing your true self.

Or there's this other Instagram account of this girl who's obsessed with people on the internet claiming to be pathological narcissists or sociopaths. She idolizes them and is building an image around being one of them. Part of me feels bad for her, but then hey maybe she's fine. Don't know what the fuck is wrong with her, but it's so interesting to watch.  

Or there is a guy who I admittedly do know in real life, but we haven't spoken in years. He was an associate pastor at my old church. But then he moved and started his own church which failed and then a coffee shop which failed and a co-working space which failed and this podcast which blew up for a minute, then failed. Now he's promoting himself as a ""peacemaker and storyteller"" posting the cringiest, most self-righteous white savior bullshit I have ever seen in my life. Knowing how he has blown up pretty much every relationship in his life and how he inevitably always fails in his creative endeavors (usually because of how he has deceived and alienated others), I know this will inevitably end in the same way. I just can't wait to see him restart his whole social media persona again in 6 months. 

Life is rough, and this is not feeding the kindest part of myself. But damn, I don't drink or smoke or start drama with my friends. We're all allowed to have a little bit of fun. ",1,1752448694.0,venting,3,1.0,False
1lz6wus,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lz6wus/my_job_is_to_make_snow_and_the_strange_things/,"My Job is to Make Snow, and the Strange Things Won’t Stop pt:1","Author note: Hey, I’ve already uploaded this story but I’ve revised it and added a bit as well as changed the title. The other one is a work in progress and this one is the finished product. Enjoy!


I’ve just finished my third winter making snow. It’s a strange job, so it only makes sense I’ve experienced some strange things while doing it. I’ve decided to catalogue some of the odd experiences I’ve had so far on here.

If you don’t know what snowmaking is, I basically am part of a team that use snowmaking machines or “guns” to make man-made snow for a ski hill so they can extend their winter seasons. I work on this small hill deep in the Canadian Rockies that’s also the oldest still operating hill in the region. There’s a small town about a 10-minute drive away, but sometimes at night that road extends longer for no apparent reason, but I’ll tell that story another time. I moved out here for the winter after failing to get rehired as a lifty at my old ski hill, and desperate to stay in the industry, I decided to apply to this snowmaking position. I figured it’d be a good fit as I don’t mind being wet and cold and I wouldn’t have to deal with customers. I got hired, and training started around the beginning of October. That’s where I first learned of the challenges this job has that few other jobs do.

Training was held in a bay of the mechanics shop. They had set up fold-out plastic chairs and tables that looked like a typical classroom. All two dozen or so of us snowmakers arrived as a group, as we all shared accommodations and had left it as a group. We were preceded by our superiors, who told everyone to take a seat as we walked in. They started training by introducing themselves; they all have real names, but honestly everyone only ever refers to them by their nicknames which are so ubiquitously used that I’ve even heard the ski hill’s owner call them by their nicknames in a professional meeting. They’ve all acquired these names from something that happened at the hill, all stories I might tell at some point. There was the manager, Jonah, the kind of guy who looks like he could be anywhere between the ages of 35 and 55, with greying curly hair and sunken features. He wore a flannel shirt and jeans with a blue Chevrolet ball cap and a pair of safety glasses, which he would never be seen without. He is average in height and slightly overweight with a goatee that doesn’t quite match his face shape. Then there was the foremen. The first to introduce themselves was Foxbody, who was a tall skinny guy in his late 20s with a head of buzzed brown hair, a curly moustache, and a tanned leathery complexion. Carrie was the only female foreman. She was on the shorter side, but you could tell was relatively brawny even with a baggy hoodie on; she had long black silky hair in a ponytail coming out the back of her plain black trucker cap. Next was Sonny. He had a stocky frame and was about 6 feet tall with unkempt long blonde hair mostly hidden by the hood from his worn-out brown Carhartt hoodie. Finally was Gremlin, a smaller Australian guy, only a little taller than Carrie but far less brawny and with wiry red hair and a long moustache in the same red on his head that almost fully covered his mouth; his neck and arms were covered in tattoos of snakes and roses.

After introductions, Jonah explained our responsibilities. It was a long, boring lecture that I’ve sat through three times now, and all the returners usually fall asleep listening to it. The gist of it was that we would work 2pm-2am or 2am-2pm because we needed to run the snowmaking guns 24/7, and night is the best time to make because that’s when the temperature is coldest. The snowguns work by firing high-pressure water and high-pressure air at the same time to break apart water droplets coming out of their nozzle so they turn to snowflakes as fast as possible. We would need to go out and adjust the air and water ratios depending on the wet bulb temperature; the different settings to do this are called banks. In general our goal was keep the guns running as effectively as possible in turn making as much snow as possible.

My back was aching by the end of the lesson from sitting in those uncomfortable chairs for so long, but unfortunately we weren’t done yet because all the foremen started handing papers to everyone. 

“This here is a list of safety precautions that are specific to this department that they didn’t outline in your online onboarding course. We’ll go over it now, and if anyone has questions about it, I’ll answer those at the end.” Jonah said. After he read out the list, there was a litany of questions, most of which were answered by the foremen and Jonah with phrases like “that’s not important for your position” or “we are not certain of the answer to that ourselves, but if we figure it out, we’ll get back to you.” Around 10 people quit and left the job because of this list, which Sonny later told me drunkenly at the bar wasn’t unusual and happens every year. Heck, some days I wonder why I didn’t join them. I’ve decided to directly put this list on here; hopefully this won’t get me in trouble, but we are working on updating this list for this upcoming season, so I should be in the clear, as it isn’t technically company documents anymore. I also put extra context in parentheses, as there is a lot of industry jargon in this list. Here’s the list, almost exactly as given to me.

Safety Precautions and Tips for Snowmakers

1. Ensure you dress properly for the weather, as we work in extreme weather conditions.
2. We work on snow and ice, so be cautious of slips, trips, and falls.
3. Be cautious when driving snowmobiles and follow all rules in the upcoming snowmobile operators course.
4. Do not approach or feed any animals you see. Instead, report it to dispatch if the animal is bigger than a porcupine.
5. Do not go onto any runs with a winch cat operating on the run (a winch cat is an industrial snowplow with a large winch on it so they can operate on steep ski runs while minimizing the risk of flipping over) the cable has enough force to seriously injure or even kill you.
6. If foreign substances, i.e., rust, mud, sticks, rocks, or animal parts come out of an air or water hydrant, allow it to flush out before connecting a hose. If you fail to do so the substance could clog the filters on the guns or burst the hose open. (Guns are connected via hoses to hydrants, which themselves are connected to a hill-wide water and air pump system.)
7. If you hear animal noises that don’t sound quite right, especially at night, just ignore them and do not report them to dispatch, as the noises themselves pose no threat. 
8. If you go on a run where there are no currently operating snow guns, report it to dispatch before proceeding.
9. If dispatch asks you what run you are on, do not respond; that is not actually dispatch, and they already know where you are anyways.
10. If a snowboarder wearing all pink is riding on an unopened run, do not stop them; simply let them proceed.
11. If you are in a hut for a break (we take breaks in whatever building is nearest to the run we are working on, usually a ski lift hut), do not leave open food containers in there when you leave the hut, as mice or something else could take it.
12. Watch for cracks in whales (piles of snow made by our snowguns), as they could split and you’ll fall in. Be careful; no matter the size of the whale. The crevasses can go deeper than seems logical.
13. If you return to where you left your snowmobile and it has disappeared, follow its tracks; they usually don’t take them farther than a few hundred feet. Remember to radio dispatch if you need to travel onto a run without any snowguns to retrieve it.
14. If you see a headlamp in the darkness that does not belong to you or your partner, nod twice with your headlamp turned on. If it does not nod twice back, report it to dispatch and calmly head back to whatever building you are using to take your break in.
15. Only report eyes in the treeline to dispatch if there are greater than 10 pairs looking at you.
16. Leave hoses to freeze after shutting off a gun (I later learned this is not industry standard; then again, not much of this is).
17. Before moving a frozen hose, inspect it for any sections unfrozen or with melting snow on top of it. If you find a section that meets these qualities, squeeze it to feel for something that will have a feeling similar to squeezing raw chicken. Should you find a hose like this, bring it to the dumpster at the base straight away and get a new hose from dispatch.
18. If you are on a run where snowcats are not scheduled to be and you see a snowcat driving along your run, stop what you are doing and hastily make your way into the treeline. Try to hide yourself and put your head down because you don’t want to see what’s in the snowcat. If you are in the alpine and above where the trees grow and there is nowhere else to hide, just go into the fetal position and put your face into the ground.
19. If the same person comes up to you from the same direction more than once to ask you the same question, don’t question them and reply as you did the first time no matter how many times this happens.
20. Take note of how you left each gun; if something has changed on it since the last time you were at it, calmly leave the area and go to dispatch, where they will have you call your foreman on the phone.
21. If you notice anything or anyone else odd or unexplainable that poses or posed an immediate threat to you or your partner, radio your foreman with the code 10-66. If it did not pose a threat to you or your partner, report it to your foreman at the end-of-shift meeting.

Reading that back, I don’t know why I didn’t decide to quit right then and there. I guess I’d figured other people had done this for several years and I was no stranger to dangerous jobs; I had spent the last summer working on a cattle farm and had a few close calls with both animals and machinery. Either way too, snowmaking is by default a very dangerous job. We were told earlier during the training session that in the last 20 years only one snowmaking crew in the region has gone without needing to make an insurance claim for a worker's injury. Despite this I still remember to this day the first time I felt the kind of danger unique to this job.

It was a clear night, and the moon was full, which was nice for us because it meant my surroundings weren’t a murky blackness outside the light of my headlamp but instead a vague image of the trees and mountains that surrounded me. My partner for the shift was a tall German guy named Deitrich; he was taking a gap year fresh out of school to do this as a working vacation. He was naive to the world but always excited to participate in it. We were both equipped with our high-vis winter coats, helmets, headlamps, and shovels. As it was the early season, the ski runs were nothing more than grassy clearings with disappointing piles of snow dotted along their paths. As we showed up to what was probably the 15th gun on this run that was placed on a flat spot at the base of a steep section which towered like a wall over us. We were around midway up the mountain, so pine trees towered over us on either side of the run. In the distance we were able to make out part of the valley and the mountains on the other side. We were off to the side of the mountain, therefore we couldn’t see the light of the base area nor that of the town. Occasionally if we were far enough away from the deafening hum of the snow guns, we could hear the rumble of the trains that frequently roll through the valley; sound really carries out here. Dietrich walked over to where the snow from the snowgun was falling in order to check the quality of the snow. I went to the gun to check for any ice buildup and be ready for if we needed to change banks. After using my shovel to knock ice off the frame of the gun, I looked down the slope to check on Dietrich, and he nodded his head twice. Even though it was a relatively bright night, it’s still difficult to make out a person’s body with their bright headlamp facing you. Head movement is the only way we can communicate when we were either too far or it was too loud to hear each other. I assumed his nodding meant the snow quality was good, so I started to walk over to him. When I had closed about half the distance, he nodded again, but it didn’t seem to be at me. I looked over my shoulder at what his light was facing, and that’s when I saw a headlamp up on the ridge that towered above us. 

It was maybe 100 feet from us. I turned back and hustled over to Dietrich. When I got to him I asked, “Hey, were you nodding at that light up there?”
Dietrich responded, “Yeah, they’ve not nodded back. That’s not good, right? What do we do?”
“Oh shit, we need to get out of here and get back to the lift hut.”
I barely got done exclaiming that sentence when we both dropped our shovels and turned to bolt down the hill. The hut was where we were taking our breaks, as well as it was the nearest building. It was a blur the whole way down except for when I briefly turned around and the light was chasing after us and had seemed to have gained 25 feet on us. I remember the light was about 8 feet off the ground, but because of the same issue with us not being able to see each other through the beams of our headlamps, I could not make out the figure the mysterious light belonged to. We kept running at full speed; I was in tunnel vision the whole time. My legs started to get tired, but the adrenaline wouldn’t let me slow down because I knew if I did I would not be able to push my legs back up to the same speed. I was sweating like a dog under all my gear, but that was the last thing I cared about at that point. Dietrich had beat me to the hut; his tall stature and lean frame made him a lot faster than me. He just about took out the door when he slammed into it trying to get it open. He held the door open for me, and I nearly wiped out trying to stop my momentum on the concrete floor inside the building.

Dietrich slammed and locked the door as I slid a chair over to him that he jammed the door with. I threw myself down onto the floor in the corner of the hut between the wall and the metal cabinet of fuses, gauges, and other controls for the ski lift. Dietrich did the same on the other side of the cabinet. My eyes darted around the room for something I could use to defend myself with. The only thing I could come up with was the thermos of coffee in my backpack; I felt so vulnerable. Now I was wishing we hadn’t dropped our shovels when we took off running. The lift operator's tools were just as out of reach, sitting outside against the wall where I could see the light was just arriving at the shack. It wasn’t bobbing up and down the way a headlamp does when someone is walking, it moved smoothly like it was floating. The light paused for a minute and seemed to get brighter, going from about as bright as a flashlight to a brightness that rivalled the sun. I had to look away as it lit up the shack like it was noon. I held my hand up to shield the source of the light from my eyes, I should’ve looked away but something urged me to want to try and look at it. I had to move my hand as the light moved. It moved to the door and I wanted to look at it directly so I could tell if it was about to attack. I knew however if I did move my hand away it was so bright I would be blinded. The attack I was expecting never came; it just began to circle the shack. It started moving at a running pace and thankfully I closed my eyes before it moved from behind my hand and I saw it directly. Through the powerful light being able to partially shine through my closed eyelids I could tell it about half a dozen laps around the building without making a sound. Afterwards it had stopped behind the hut, which was the only side with no windows. That’s when the light suddenly went out like someone flipped a switch and turned it off. I leaned around the corner of the control box to look at Dietrich. “You think it’s gone now?” I whispered.
“I think so. Should we radio Sonny?” Dietrich replied, his voice shaky. I nodded to him and pulled my radio out of the holster on my chest. “Colt to Sonny”. I said into the radio. 
“Go ahead.”
“We just had a 10-66.” I was trying and failing to sound calm about it because everyone working on the mountain used the same radio channel and I wanted to seem tough.
“10-4, what’s your 20?” His tone had changed from his usual casual speech to a tone that told me that even he had become concerned.
“Bottom of Spruce Chair”
“10-4, I’m on my way; you two hang in there.”
Sonny approached the hut on the side-by-side with caution, scanning the area and wielding a shovel. We moved the chair and unlocked the door to let him in. Once he was inside, he took off his helmet and said, “So, you guys okay? What happened?” 
I told him we weren’t hurt but we were pretty shaken. I told him how Dietrich saw it first and when it didn’t nod back we bolted for the hut and hid in it. “Ok, luckily you guys were quick and not too far from the building. If you see it again, though, treat it like a grizzly and don’t run. Next time walk back calmly, as hard as that sounds.”
“How often do people see that thing?” Dietrich asked with concern in his voice. “Usually once or twice a season, but it hasn’t harmed anyone since my first season 4 years ago. A couple of snowmakers were making a run with a long setup where the gun was out of sight from the hydrant. They started the gun up, and the guy down at the gun walked into the trees quickly to take a leak and he shut off his light. The guy up at the hydrant walked over the ridge and saw the same mysterious light you guys saw tonight. He assumed it was his partner and walked right up to it. The poor dude was put into a coma, and had to be airlifted out of there. He didn’t wake up for a couple weeks, and when he did, he was blinded. Last I heard, he still is sadly. So you guys got lucky it didn’t catch up before you got in here.” Sonny was pretty uncharacteristically serious in his tone telling the story, which I wouldn’t hear again for a while.
“Oh shit, that’s awful.” I responded. It was probably a lacklustre response, but so much was bouncing through my head that it was all I could muster to say. Dietrich stayed silent, which was probably the better thing to do in that moment. “You guys rest in here for a bit; I’ll go check on your guns for you. At the end of the shift you guys will have to fill out a strange occurrence form. Good work out there; you both have killed it this season so far.” Sonny said, his usual light hearted tone had returned.

That was the first of a few strange things I’ve witnessed during my time here. I’ve got to get back to work now, though. We’ve got a safety meeting this afternoon where it’ll be just foremen, Jonah, and our safety rep attending, so it’s probably going to be about these strange occurrences like that one. Maybe I’ll be reminded of a story I can write about and put onto here.",2,1752448671.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,1.0,False

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1lz6prl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Charted_Studios/comments/1lz6prl/my_job_is_to_make_snow_and_the_strange_things/,My job is to make snow and the strange things won’t stop pt:1 (revised),"I’ve just finished my third winter making snow. It’s a strange job, so it only makes sense I’ve experienced some strange things while doing it. I’ve decided to catalogue some of the odd experiences I’ve had so far on here.

If you don’t know what snowmaking is, I basically am part of a team that use snowmaking machines or “guns” to make man-made snow for a ski hill so they can extend their winter seasons. I work on this small hill deep in the Canadian Rockies that’s also the oldest still operating hill in the region. There’s a small town about a 10-minute drive away, but sometimes at night that road extends longer for no apparent reason, but I’ll tell that story another time. I moved out here for the winter after failing to get rehired as a lifty at my old ski hill, and desperate to stay in the industry, I decided to apply to this snowmaking position. I figured it’d be a good fit as I don’t mind being wet and cold and I wouldn’t have to deal with customers. I got hired, and training started around the beginning of October. That’s where I first learned of the challenges this job has that few other jobs do.

Training was held in a bay of the mechanics shop. They had set up fold-out plastic chairs and tables that looked like a typical classroom. All two dozen or so of us snowmakers arrived as a group, as we all shared accommodations and had left it as a group. We were preceded by our superiors, who told everyone to take a seat as we walked in. They started training by introducing themselves; they all have real names, but honestly everyone only ever refers to them by their nicknames which are so ubiquitously used that I’ve even heard the ski hill’s owner call them by their nicknames in a professional meeting. They’ve all acquired these names from something that happened at the hill, all stories I might tell at some point. There was the manager, Jonah, the kind of guy who looks like he could be anywhere between the ages of 35 and 55, with greying curly hair and sunken features. He wore a flannel shirt and jeans with a blue Chevrolet ball cap and a pair of safety glasses, which he would never be seen without. He is average in height and slightly overweight with a goatee that doesn’t quite match his face shape. Then there was the foremen. The first to introduce themselves was Foxbody, who was a tall skinny guy in his late 20s with a head of buzzed brown hair, a curly moustache, and a tanned leathery complexion. Carrie was the only female foreman. She was on the shorter side, but you could tell was relatively brawny even with a baggy hoodie on; she had long black silky hair in a ponytail coming out the back of her plain black trucker cap. Next was Sonny. He had a stocky frame and was about 6 feet tall with unkempt long blonde hair mostly hidden by the hood from his worn-out brown Carhartt hoodie. Finally was Gremlin, a smaller Australian guy, only a little taller than Carrie but far less brawny and with wiry red hair and a long moustache in the same red on his head that almost fully covered his mouth; his neck and arms were covered in tattoos of snakes and roses.

After introductions, Jonah explained our responsibilities. It was a long, boring lecture that I’ve sat through three times now, and all the returners usually fall asleep listening to it. The gist of it was that we would work 2pm-2am or 2am-2pm because we needed to run the snowmaking guns 24/7, and night is the best time to make because that’s when the temperature is coldest. The snowguns work by firing high-pressure water and high-pressure air at the same time to break apart water droplets coming out of their nozzle so they turn to snowflakes as fast as possible. We would need to go out and adjust the air and water ratios depending on the wet bulb temperature; the different settings to do this are called banks. In general our goal was keep the guns running as effectively as possible in turn making as much snow as possible.

My back was aching by the end of the lesson from sitting in those uncomfortable chairs for so long, but unfortunately we weren’t done yet because all the foremen started handing papers to everyone. 

“This here is a list of safety precautions that are specific to this department that they didn’t outline in your online onboarding course. We’ll go over it now, and if anyone has questions about it, I’ll answer those at the end.” Jonah said. After he read out the list, there was a litany of questions, most of which were answered by the foremen and Jonah with phrases like “that’s not important for your position” or “we are not certain of the answer to that ourselves, but if we figure it out, we’ll get back to you.” Around 10 people quit and left the job because of this list, which Sonny later told me drunkenly at the bar wasn’t unusual and happens every year. Heck, some days I wonder why I didn’t join them. I’ve decided to directly put this list on here; hopefully this won’t get me in trouble, but we are working on updating this list for this upcoming season, so I should be in the clear, as it isn’t technically company documents anymore. I also put extra context in parentheses, as there is a lot of industry jargon in this list. Here’s the list, almost exactly as given to me.

Safety Precautions and Tips for Snowmakers

1. Ensure you dress properly for the weather, as we work in extreme weather conditions.
2. We work on snow and ice, so be cautious of slips, trips, and falls.
3. Be cautious when driving snowmobiles and follow all rules in the upcoming snowmobile operators course.
4. Do not approach or feed any animals you see. Instead, report it to dispatch if the animal is bigger than a porcupine.
5. Do not go onto any runs with a winch cat operating on the run (a winch cat is an industrial snowplow with a large winch on it so they can operate on steep ski runs while minimizing the risk of flipping over) the cable has enough force to seriously injure or even kill you.
6. If foreign substances, i.e., rust, mud, sticks, rocks, or animal parts come out of an air or water hydrant, allow it to flush out before connecting a hose. If you fail to do so the substance could clog the filters on the guns or burst the hose open. (Guns are connected via hoses to hydrants, which themselves are connected to a hill-wide water and air pump system.)
7. If you hear animal noises that don’t sound quite right, especially at night, just ignore them and do not report them to dispatch, as the noises themselves pose no threat. 
8. If you go on a run where there are no currently operating snow guns, report it to dispatch before proceeding.
9. If dispatch asks you what run you are on, do not respond; that is not actually dispatch, and they already know where you are anyways.
10. If a snowboarder wearing all pink is riding on an unopened run, do not stop them; simply let them proceed.
11. If you are in a hut for a break (we take breaks in whatever building is nearest to the run we are working on, usually a ski lift hut), do not leave open food containers in there when you leave the hut, as mice or something else could take it.
12. Watch for cracks in whales (piles of snow made by our snowguns), as they could split and you’ll fall in. Be careful; no matter the size of the whale. The crevasses can go deeper than seems logical.
13. If you return to where you left your snowmobile and it has disappeared, follow its tracks; they usually don’t take them farther than a few hundred feet. Remember to radio dispatch if you need to travel onto a run without any snowguns to retrieve it.
14. If you see a headlamp in the darkness that does not belong to you or your partner, nod twice with your headlamp turned on. If it does not nod twice back, report it to dispatch and calmly head back to whatever building you are using to take your break in.
15. Only report eyes in the treeline to dispatch if there are greater than 10 pairs looking at you.
16. Leave hoses to freeze after shutting off a gun (I later learned this is not industry standard; then again, not much of this is).
17. Before moving a frozen hose, inspect it for any sections unfrozen or with melting snow on top of it. If you find a section that meets these qualities, squeeze it to feel for something that will have a feeling similar to squeezing raw chicken. Should you find a hose like this, bring it to the dumpster at the base straight away and get a new hose from dispatch.
18. If you are on a run where snowcats are not scheduled to be and you see a snowcat driving along your run, stop what you are doing and hastily make your way into the treeline. Try to hide yourself and put your head down because you don’t want to see what’s in the snowcat. If you are in the alpine and above where the trees grow and there is nowhere else to hide, just go into the fetal position and put your face into the ground.
19. If the same person comes up to you from the same direction more than once to ask you the same question, don’t question them and reply as you did the first time no matter how many times this happens.
20. Take note of how you left each gun; if something has changed on it since the last time you were at it, calmly leave the area and go to dispatch, where they will have you call your foreman on the phone.
21. If you notice anything or anyone else odd or unexplainable that poses or posed an immediate threat to you or your partner, radio your foreman with the code 10-66. If it did not pose a threat to you or your partner, report it to your foreman at the end-of-shift meeting.

Reading that back, I don’t know why I didn’t decide to quit right then and there. I guess I’d figured other people had done this for several years and I was no stranger to dangerous jobs; I had spent the last summer working on a cattle farm and had a few close calls with both animals and machinery. Either way too, snowmaking is by default a very dangerous job. We were told earlier during the training session that in the last 20 years only one snowmaking crew in the region has gone without needing to make an insurance claim for a worker's injury. Despite this I still remember to this day the first time I felt the kind of danger unique to this job.

It was a clear night, and the moon was full, which was nice for us because it meant my surroundings weren’t a murky blackness outside the light of my headlamp but instead a vague image of the trees and mountains that surrounded me. My partner for the shift was a tall German guy named Deitrich; he was taking a gap year fresh out of school to do this as a working vacation. He was naive to the world but always excited to participate in it. We were both equipped with our high-vis winter coats, helmets, headlamps, and shovels. As it was the early season, the ski runs were nothing more than grassy clearings with disappointing piles of snow dotted along their paths. As we showed up to what was probably the 15th gun on this run that was placed on a flat spot at the base of a steep section which towered like a wall over us. We were around midway up the mountain, so pine trees towered over us on either side of the run. In the distance we were able to make out part of the valley and the mountains on the other side. We were off to the side of the mountain, therefore we couldn’t see the light of the base area nor that of the town. Occasionally if we were far enough away from the deafening hum of the snow guns, we could hear the rumble of the trains that frequently roll through the valley; sound really carries out here. Dietrich walked over to where the snow from the snowgun was falling in order to check the quality of the snow. I went to the gun to check for any ice buildup and be ready for if we needed to change banks. After using my shovel to knock ice off the frame of the gun, I looked down the slope to check on Dietrich, and he nodded his head twice. Even though it was a relatively bright night, it’s still difficult to make out a person’s body with their bright headlamp facing you. Head movement is the only way we can communicate when we were either too far or it was too loud to hear each other. I assumed his nodding meant the snow quality was good, so I started to walk over to him. When I had closed about half the distance, he nodded again, but it didn’t seem to be at me. I looked over my shoulder at what his light was facing, and that’s when I saw a headlamp up on the ridge that towered above us. 

It was maybe 100 feet from us. I turned back and hustled over to Dietrich. When I got to him I asked, “Hey, were you nodding at that light up there?”
Dietrich responded, “Yeah, they’ve not nodded back. That’s not good, right? What do we do?”
“Oh shit, we need to get out of here and get back to the lift hut.”
I barely got done exclaiming that sentence when we both dropped our shovels and turned to bolt down the hill. The hut was where we were taking our breaks, as well as it was the nearest building. It was a blur the whole way down except for when I briefly turned around and the light was chasing after us and had seemed to have gained 25 feet on us. I remember the light was about 8 feet off the ground, but because of the same issue with us not being able to see each other through the beams of our headlamps, I could not make out the figure the mysterious light belonged to. We kept running at full speed; I was in tunnel vision the whole time. My legs started to get tired, but the adrenaline wouldn’t let me slow down because I knew if I did I would not be able to push my legs back up to the same speed. I was sweating like a dog under all my gear, but that was the last thing I cared about at that point. Dietrich had beat me to the hut; his tall stature and lean frame made him a lot faster than me. He just about took out the door when he slammed into it trying to get it open. He held the door open for me, and I nearly wiped out trying to stop my momentum on the concrete floor inside the building.

Dietrich slammed and locked the door as I slid a chair over to him that he jammed the door with. I threw myself down onto the floor in the corner of the hut between the wall and the metal cabinet of fuses, gauges, and other controls for the ski lift. Dietrich did the same on the other side of the cabinet. My eyes darted around the room for something I could use to defend myself with. The only thing I could come up with was the thermos of coffee in my backpack; I felt so vulnerable. Now I was wishing we hadn’t dropped our shovels when we took off running. The lift operator's tools were just as out of reach, sitting outside against the wall where I could see the light was just arriving at the shack.

Afterwards it had stopped behind the hut, which was the only side with no windows. That’s when the light suddenly went out like someone flipped a switch and turned it off. I leaned around the corner of the control box to look at Dietrich. “You think it’s gone now?” I whispered.
“I think so. Should we radio Sonny?” Dietrich replied, his voice shaky. I nodded to him and pulled my radio out of the holster on my chest. “Colt to Sonny”. I said into the radio. 
“Go ahead.”
“We just had a 10-66.” I was trying and failing to sound calm about it because everyone working on the mountain used the same radio channel and I wanted to seem tough.
“10-4, what’s your 20?” His tone had changed from his usual casual speech to a tone that told me that even he had become concerned.
“Bottom of Spruce Chair”
“10-4, I’m on my way; you two hang in there.”
Sonny approached the hut on the side-by-side with caution, scanning the area and wielding a shovel. We moved the chair and unlocked the door to let him in. Once he was inside, he took off his helmet and said, “So, you guys okay? What happened?” 
I told him we weren’t hurt but we were pretty shaken. I told him how Dietrich saw it first and when it didn’t nod back we bolted for the hut and hid in it. “Ok, luckily you guys were quick and not too far from the building. If you see it again, though, treat it like a grizzly and don’t run. Next time walk back calmly, as hard as that sounds.”
“How often do people see that thing?” Dietrich asked with concern in his voice. “Usually once or twice a season, but it hasn’t harmed anyone since my first season 4 years ago. A couple of snowmakers were making a run with a long setup where the gun was out of sight from the hydrant. They started the gun up, and the guy down at the gun walked into the trees quickly to take a leak and he shut off his light. The guy up at the hydrant walked over the ridge and saw the same mysterious light you guys saw tonight. He assumed it was his partner and walked right up to it. The poor dude was put into a coma, and had to be airlifted out of there. He didn’t wake up for a couple weeks, and when he did, he was blinded. Last I heard, he still is sadly. So you guys got lucky it didn’t catch up before you got in here.” Sonny was pretty uncharacteristically serious in his tone telling the story, which I wouldn’t hear again for a while.
“Oh shit, that’s awful.” I responded. It was probably a lacklustre response, but so much was bouncing through my head that it was all I could muster to say. Dietrich stayed silent, which was probably the better thing to do in that moment. “You guys rest in here for a bit; I’ll go check on your guns for you. At the end of the shift you guys will have to fill out a strange occurrence form. Good work out there; you both have killed it this season so far.” Sonny said, his usual light hearted tone had returned.

That was the first of a few strange things I’ve witnessed during my time here. I’ve got to get back to work now, though. We’ve got a safety meeting this afternoon where it’ll be just foremen, Jonah, and our safety rep attending, so it’s probably going to be about these strange occurrences like that one. Maybe I’ll be reminded of a story I can write about and put onto here.",1,1752448148.0,u_Charted_Studios,0,0.99,False

don’t get me wrong, i have tons of issues with various solids, but with liquids, i’m exclusively a water-only person.

is that how it is for anyone else?

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

There we're so many beautiful plants and animals around me, It's so strange how abstract reality is. Vivid purples, pinks, greens, browns, yellows, whites and whatever other colors you can imagine. 

Don't imagine too much or else it will become true. I lit the candle, put it inside the lantern, and sat it on the flattest rock I could find. Get up and find a pine tree. So I did. I whipped the area I was to work in with the pine tree, then lit a campfire using it. One stick at a time I built the fire. Soon it engulfed the nearby tree, I don't mind. Once my work was done, I put out the fire with my handy-dandy towel I always carry. Learned this trick from a book, where a particularly stupid alien species was known to carry household items while traveling space. The tree was left a depressing grey color. I named it Empty tree. It's a reminder of how fragile my work is.",1,1752447974.0,u_RideWooden4700,0,1.0,False

The first few days postpartum we're going ok physically. Mentally I cannot describe it as anything but living hell, but my recovery seemed normal. 1 week postpartum I developed severe abdominal pain and my bleeding began to increase. We went back to the hospital to discover that I had retained product and elected for a D&C to remove the remaining product rather than trying the misoprostol. The D&C was done by suction and hysteroscopy, I lost a liter of blood and there was more retained product than first thought. I didn't bleed/had minimal bleeding for the first 3 days after the procedure, but on day 4 until now almost 1 week post D&C I am still passing red/pink tissue each time I pee and have light red/pink light bleeding. I am going to call my doctor tomorrow to confirm this is normal, just looking for some insight or stories that are maybe similar to ours. Is passing tissue the size of a coffee bean each time I pee normal? I really don't want anymore complications.. losing a baby was enough, I can't handle anymore bad news.",1,1752447934.0,tfmr_support,1,1.0,False
