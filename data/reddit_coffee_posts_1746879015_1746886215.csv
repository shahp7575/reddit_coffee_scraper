1kjb49x,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1kjb49x/brain_blackouts/,Brain blackouts,"I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for about two years, and it‚Äôs worked great- though a couple side effects continue to plague me, such as brain fog and tremors.
About a month or so ago my depression and ADHD was back in full force, and my psychiatrist upped my dosage to 300 XL and 150 XL to total 450, and 5mg adderall.

I don‚Äôt take the adderall every day, especially since I am a coffee lover, it can make me jittery. 

Seemingly at random I will get what I call brain blackouts. The only way I can explain it is if my brain was a table and someone took their arm and cleared it of all contents at once.
I am a dancer, and this is detrimental to my performance, as I can‚Äôt afford to just randomly forget choreography and what comes next, that‚Äôs how people get hurt.
I fully forget either what I‚Äôm currently doing, or what‚Äôs coming next, and it‚Äôs like a split second of panic. 
Last night I had taken my adderall a couple hours before my rehearsal. The drive was crazy with traffic, 1.5 hrs- then the rehearsal itself was 3 hrs, until 9:30pm. We didn‚Äôt really take a break for longer than a couple minutes, it was humid, I was sweating like crazy.
All that to say, when the brain blank happened, it was the very end of the night and I was *exhausted* mentally and physically.

I was so mortified as we were in the middle of the piece and they had to completely stop the music on my account because I just stood there with not a single thing in my head.

How do I combat this? Are there supplements I can take, should I talk to my psychiatrist, is this common?

Proteinuria.  Wondering if I need a quicker follow up.  Also Wondering if I can quit using statins.  

Pcp says I only need yearly follow up but I thought I‚Äôd ask here just for some secondary feedback.  

Have tried my best to include all relevant information.  

Appointment on April 12th last month.  
Meds:  ambien 10mg PRN, Rosuvastatin 10mg, multivitamin, was using creating 5gpd last couple months but have since quit.  

Use zyns 3mg probably 6-7 a day.

Lost 20 pounds in last year maybe 1/2 in last 3 months months.  

I was using Kratom for about a year prior to these labs at a moderate to high level (30-70 grams per day ascending use) but had quit 10 days before labs.  I have remained quit and NO plans to return to using.  withdrawal was unexpected and rougher than I thought.  

Hx alcohol use/binge drinking intermittently over last 5-6 years 2-3 times weekly average (3-8 white claws) but had quit except maybe once every 2-3 months in last year.  Some long periods of no alcohol. Some periods where I drank more frequently.  Do not drink currently.  Last alcohol use a week before labs or so.  

Had worked out pretty frequently before labs (week prior) and also eat fairly high protein diet.

We hit it off immediately, exchanged numbers quickly and the conversation kept flowing from there.

We started video calling each other every day, spending hours on these calls. The vibes were good. We both seemed to want the same things: open channels of communication, honesty etc. 

She seemed very interested, with the flirting intensifying and our desire to see each other in person growing. She had already started calling me by pet-names, stating she knew she was going to fall for me and the conversation sometimes turning intimate in nature.

I asked if I could drive through to her for the weekend and I stated I would get an airbnb as we were still relatively strangers. She insisted I stay with her as after the hours of video calls she said she felt she could trust me.

I had to make arrangements with my work to take Friday off and as I share my car with my roommate, arranged to take the car for the weekend. Everything was set for me to drive through on the Friday morning (a 2 hour drive for those that don‚Äôt know).

In the days leading up to Friday things felt a bit off with her, but I tried to look past it. She asked me numerous times if I was going to show up and made me promise not to ghost or ditch her. Last video call on the Thursday night before the trip. Flirting was intense as ever and we both expressed how excited we were for the next day.

The next day on Friday, woke up early to hit the road. Sent morning messages that went unanswered but it was really early so I assumed she must still be asleep. After about 40mins on the road I pulled off to get a cup of coffee at a garage. I messaged to let her know that I was getting a cup of coffee and would be back on the road in 10 mins. Only to find that she had blocked me on What‚Äôsapp, blocked my cellphone number so I couldn‚Äôt phone her normally and had unmatched from me on Tinder. 

After about 5 minutes I turned around and headed back to Pretoria. Going instead to a friend‚Äôs house as I needed to let him know about this nonsense. Upon arriving we had a look at the address she gave me on google streetview and it didn‚Äôt line up with what I had seen on our video calls at all. 

Current theories are that she was cheating on her partner and got cold feet or is just a sociopath or maybe I‚Äôm just an absolute moron. All likely. Would love to hear your thoughts.",11,1746885379.0,southafrica,13,1.0,False

I have been to Teotihuacan, Medellin market, the national library, various museums. I usually stay in Polanco, but this time will be staying in Condesa.

A strong contender is also going to Tepoztlan for just a day trip and spending 8 or so hours there.

I‚Äôll give it another week or two then pull back then calories a bit or maybe add some more steps.

But how soon do you make a course correction if you are losing weight TOO FAST?

I‚Äôve been dieting since early March and have an OVERALL weekly weight loss of 1.71lbs a week, however my CURRENT loss per week is at 2.22lbs since I added 10-12k daily steps.

Objective data:

5‚Äô7 Starting weight: 179.1 on March 11. Current weight: 162.5 on May 10. 3.6lb loss in last 7 days. 7.6 loss in last 30.

Average daily intake per week:

1600 calories 140-150 protein 170ish carb 45ish fat 25 fibre Basically no added sugar outside of the occasion 1 in a coffee.

Subjective data:

I feel fine. Honestly feel pretty great. I‚Äôve gotten very comfortable with my diet and only ever feel kinda hungry in the morning, outside of that I‚Äôm good. Never any big cravings or feeling bad about not eating enough, I‚Äôm satisfied.

Sleep has not been affected. A couple crappy nights but each one attributable to something else (caffeine or exercise too close to bed, personal stressors, a joint for the first time in a while).

1kjaurv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjaurv,"Scotland 2025 Trip Reports - Final Speyside Tastings (Gordon & MacPhail private tasting, Glenfarclas Decades tour)","On my final day in Scotland, even though Spirit of Speyside was over, I got to enjoy two incredible experiences: a private tasting at Gordon & MacPhail, and the Decades tour at Glenfarclas, which features family cask expressions dating back to the 1960s.

***Gordon & MacPhail Tasting***

* I owe many thanks to Stephen and Russell of G&M for arranging this tasting and accommodating my schedule. The lineup was incredible, with whiskies ranging from an 18-year-old Ardmore to a 38-year-old Caol Ila. Russell, a true whisky aficionado, had visited many of the distilleries whose whiskies I got to try, and he was full of fun and informative facts about them. For instance, Ardmore is one of the few Highland distilleries to largely make peated malt. But they make unpeated Ardmore as well, and apparently fans of the brand jokingly refer to the unpeated spirit as ‚ÄúArd-less‚Äù to distinguish it from ‚ÄúArd-more.‚Äù¬†
* This tasting happened at G&M‚Äôs temporary shop at Johnstons of Elgin, the high-end cashmere maker. The shop itself, although temporary, has a great setup, with the store in the front and private tasting rooms in the back. To my surprise, they had a pretty robust allocation of Blanton‚Äôs, including Blanton‚Äôs Gold and Straight from the Barrel, for very fair prices (105 and 150 pounds, respectively). Who knew that Elgin would be a good place to hunt for rare bourbons?
* Back in 2023, G&M announced that it would soon stop filling new casks, in part because the company had two distilleries of its own‚ÄìBenromach and Cairn‚Äìto focus on, and in part because fewer and fewer distilleries were willing to sell G&M their new make. I get all the business reasons for restricting those sales, since independent bottlers may cannibalize sales from the main brand or may muddy their brand image if the independent bottles have a very different flavor profile. But given G&M‚Äôs long history in the industry‚Äìit bought a lot during past downturns, keeping the lights on at some places‚Äìit‚Äôs a little disappointing to see the distilleries change their tune during the good times. It makes me wonder if the current wobble in the whisky market will spook some distilleries into asking G&M to work with them again. In any event, it won‚Äôt be a problem for us as consumers for decades to come; G&M is sitting on over ten thousand casks already, so they're not going to run out of single casks to bottle for a long time.

**G&M Ardmore 2003, 18 y.o.** (46%) - I haven't had much if any Ardmore before, but I can see why it makes good blending stock. While it didn't have any really bold or sharp-edged flavors, it exhibited a nice balance between grassy, Highland peat, industrial notes, and a malty sweetness. It also makes a lot of sense why G&M released this under the Distillery Labels line, since it gives a good window into the core distillery character. Drinking 18-year-old whisky is pretty nice‚Äìand even nicer when it's just to season the palate before moving on to even rarer drams.

**G&M Dailuaine 1998 Refill American Hogshead, 26 y.o.** (52.6%) - The irony is that Russell built this lineup around my preferences for smoky Islay whiskies, but this unpeated whisky turned out to be my favorite of the whole tasting. I've had very little if any Dailuaine, which isn't often bottled as a single malt but mainly goes into blends. In fact, Russell mentioned that Diageo sees Dailuaine as a potential substitute for Clynelish in many of its big-name blends (e.g., Johnnie Walker Blue Label), and that made perfect sense when I tasted it. The standout feature of this dram was its very waxy, mouthcoating texture. As one would expect of a refill cask, especially one of this age, the dominant flavors were very pleasant fruity, creamy, and balsamic notes of fizzy lemon and vanilla sorbet. A few days ago, Stewart Buchanan sang the praises of refill bourbon hogsheads, and this dram showed me how right he was.

**G&M Glen Grant 1994 Refill American Hogshead, 30 y.o.** (46.8%) - Glen Grant was the favorite whisky of ‚ÄúMr. George,‚Äù George Urquhart, who played a titanic role in making G&M a successful independent bottler. I got to enjoy this dram at a single cask tasting earlier in the week, and it was just as nice the second time around. Like a deep breath of fresh mountain meadow air, this whisky was floral, mellow, crisp, and refreshing.

**G&M Ledaig 1993 Refill Sherry Butt, 30 y.o.** (57.2%) - Ledaig is like a quirky cousin or hybrid of the more famous medicinal, smoky, peaty single malts of Islay and the farmier, funkier whiskies of Campbeltown, particularly Springbank. And sherry maturation is the perfect fit for Ledaig‚Äôs slightly dirty, musty style of peat. This whisky had aromas of oranges and charred bell peppers, and the palate carried through with some smashed berries and vinegar-based BBQ sauce sweetness along with a wisp of smoke in the background.

**G&M Caol Ila 1984 Refill American Hogshead, 38 y.o.** (53.3%) - Islay peat definitely leapt out the glass on the nose‚Äìah, how I've missed this intoxicating scent. Pineapple and guava led the way on the palate, which retained a surprising amount of smoke after 38 years. Overall, like most Caol Ilas, it had a light and delicate body, not thick or heavy like an Ardbeg. Old Caol Ila ages up so well, and this one is no exception.

***Glenfarclas Decades Tour and Tasting***

* For the grand finale of my time in Speyside and my whisky-drinking odyssey through Scotland, I returned one last time to one of my favorite distilleries, Glenfarclas. Their Decades tour and tasting focuses on the distillery‚Äôs famed Family Cask collection, a series of single casks currently covering the years from 1953 (the year Glenfarclas was allowed to resume distilling after World War II and after grain rationing ended in the UK, I believe) to 2009. Earlier in the week, as part of Spirit of Speyside, I got to join a group that picked the next cask in the lineup, the first 2010 in the collection. I booked this Decades tour after the tickets for another incredible-sounding Spirit of Speyside event, the Eight Decades of Glenfarclas, sold out before I could grab one. In contrast to the festival-only Eight Decades experience, this weekly offering covers a mere five decades of Family Cask whiskies ranging from the 1960s to the 2000s. I know, not too shabby at all (for a hefty 150 pounds, but well worth it in my book). I imagine the Eight Decades tasting added a 1950s Family Cask and probably the 2011 Spirit of Speyside festival exclusive release.¬†
* In contrast to the busier festival times, the visitors center was almost sedate when I arrived. Julia took me and one other guest around the distillery for this tour, and we had a grand time. While we followed a similar path to the tour I took just the day before with distillery manager Callum Fraser, I learned some different and quirkier information from Julia. For instance, when the pipes inside the distillery clog up with mash, the workers insert soccer balls into the pipes and then apply pneumatic pressure behind them to clear out the debris. Lest we think she was not being serious, she even showed us the soccer balls outside the stillhouse, which looked a little bit worse for wear.
* As mentioned above, Glenfarclas‚Äôs oldest whiskies date back to 1953, the first year they resumed production after WWII. They have one cask remaining in the warehouse from ‚Äò53, and another one that they‚Äôre bottling soon as a special, 70-year-old edition. I can‚Äôt even imagine what that whisky must taste like.

**Glenfarclas 2006 Family Cask, 15 y.o.** (60%) - This relatively young family cask matured in a first-fill sherry butt and produced some stellar whisky. My notes on the nose included brown sugar, chocolate, fudge, and old wood furniture, while the palate carried all the classic sherried scotch flavors of Christmas cake, honey, and sticky, sweet fruit, with a hint of spice. This one was my favorite dram of the tasting.

**Glenfarclas 1994 Family Cask, 26 y.o.** (50.5%) - A dramatic change from the first whisky, this much older but much lighter, honey-colored dram aged in a fourth-fill sherry butt. Refill sherry tends to produce more citrus notes, which was true here, as this whisky had a distinct orange-rind scent. On the palate, tart, candied pineapple dominated‚Äìa telltale flavor of older whiskies. This was very good, in a very different way than its younger cousin.

**Glenfarclas 1980 Family Cask, 42 y.o.** (46.7%) - Julia mentioned to us that the 1980s‚Äìmy birth decade, alas‚Äìwere a really tough time for the whisky industry thanks to coal strikes and other economic upheaval. In addition, Spain changed its laws to require sherry to be dumped in the sherry triangle, which dramatically curtailed the supply of sherry casks to the U.K. (Distributors used to send sherry to the U.K. in casks and then fill bottles there, meaning those transport casks could go to whiskymakers.) As a result, many whiskies from that era aged in older sherry casks refilled several times‚Äìup to six, in fact, which doesn‚Äôt really happen nowadays. Unfortunately, this whisky struck me as a little overaged, with an almost chemical or artificial green or white peach flavor that veered quite botanical.

**Glenfarclas 1970 Family Cask, 45 y.o.** (53%) - We ended the tasting with not one, but two, first-fill sherry cask whiskies‚Äìwhich is pretty wild when considering that the two of them get close to 100 years of combined maturation. The color on these whiskies was as dark as I‚Äôve ever seen; they resembled cola, black tea, or balsamic vinegar. This whisky was very nutty and, when I nosed it, instantly brought me to the dunnage warehouse, with those intoxicating scents of petrichor, musty wood, and volatile but delightful vapors in the air. In flavor, however, this whisky took too much barrel influence, tasting at times exactly like sherry, with very little spirit character left.

**Glenfarclas 1963 Family Cask, 51 y.o.** (45.1%) - This whisky, like the 1970 cask, also immediately recalled the scent of a dunnage warehouse, although it also had notes of leather and melted grape freeze-pops (yes, strange, I know). This was a delight to sip and quite complex: tropical fruit, chocolate, resins, and a pleasant amount of oak, leading to a long, waxy finish. This is the oldest whisky I‚Äôve ever tried, and was my second favorite of the lineup (go figure, it lost to the youngest).

***Food Tips for Future Scottish Roadtrippers***

* Since I didn‚Äôt cover food or restaurant suggestions extensively in my prior recaps, let me recap some of the places I ate on this trip. As a general matter‚Äìand this may surprise people who haven‚Äôt visited Scotland before‚Äìthe food is great. For those scared of haggis or black pudding, for instance, all I can say is: please try it, at least once. These dishes are absolutely delicious, and most Scottish restaurants worth their tartan know how to prepare them in ways that suit the modern palate. I had haggis at both **Makar‚Äôs Mash Bar** in Edinburgh and at the **Mash Tun** in Aberlour, and I recommend both, although the edge goes to Makar‚Äôs incredibly hearty and scrumptious meals.
* Meat pies are another Scottish food staple; I had a delicious curry chicken one at **Athletic Arms** in Edinburgh, which was a perfect bar snack and very inexpensive (maybe 3-4 pounds), and then a bigger venison pie at Mash Tun that was also quite tasty.
* Afternoon tea is also a must at some point during any U.K. trip, and there are plenty of places around Speyside that have a good reputation and live up to it. I tried a very reasonably priced (16.5 pounds) afternoon tea at **Toot‚Äôs Cafe Bar in the Station Hotel**. The visual pleasure of the tower and elegant tea set alone might have been worth the price, and every item I tasted‚Äìincluding their own take on the currently viral Dubai chocolate phenomenon‚Äìhit the spot.
* Indian food is one of my favorite types of cuisine and, thankfully, it is very well-represented all over the UK. On past visits to Glasgow, I‚Äôve always found **Chaakoo** **Bombay Cafe** to be a guaranteed winner, and was happy to find one in Edinburgh as well. Up in Speyside or on the road, Indian food isn‚Äôt quite as omnipresent, but Elgin has quite a few places, headlined by the spectacular **Qismat** and **Spice Tandoori**. Both of them offer insane value-for-money lunch specials. Qismat‚Äôs is a three-course meal for around 15 pounds, including a pakora starter, a curry main, and two scoops of ice cream. Spice Tandoori counters with a 14-pound meal, but that one only covers an appetizer and a curry (although I think you could add ice cream, coffee, or tea, for another pound or two, so it‚Äôs really similar).
* My one caveat (for Americans in particular) is that burgers tend to be both relatively pricey and somewhat mediocre in my experience. Of course, burgers are expensive in the U.S. now, too, but a burger-and-fries plate often goes for 18-20 pounds at sitdown restaurants in Scotland, and their flavor pales in comparison to the intense umami detonations that characterize the best burger spots in any major (or even minor) U.S. city. In fairness, I‚Äôve noticed this in other European countries as well. We really have the right grills or griddles for burger-making, and I don‚Äôt think the Euros use the same equipment.
* Finally, when I‚Äôm road-tripping around Scotland, I‚Äôve often found simple microwave food or takeaway items from the national chain **Co-Op** to be really tasty‚Äìat least on par with Trader Joe‚Äôs in the U.S., and perhaps better. So if your rental has a kitchen or kitchenette, as I often opt for, Co-Op can be a great way to get a fast and cheap meal, particularly if your schedule is otherwise packed to the gills with events. When drinking whisky, it pays to do so on a full stomach, so simple groceries can be a lifesaver.

That wraps up my time in Scotland, hope you‚Äôve enjoyed reading along! I plan to come back in future years and continue exploring this breathtaking country and enjoying its warm hospitality. Slainte!

Brothers‚Äô Castro Street businesses fight for survival

Two longtime Castro Street businesses on the 400 block of the iconic thoroughfare told the Bay Area Reporter they don‚Äôt have much time if they want to stay in their storefronts. They‚Äôre asking the community for help even as the end of their leases loom and their commercial spaces are set to be taken over by Another Planet Entertainment.

Brothers Ken Khoury, of the Castro Coffee Co. at 427 Castro Street, and Riyad Khoury, of the Castro Nail Salon at 431 Castro Street, both straight allies, flank the Castro Theatre, managed by APE and currently closed for renovations. As the B.A.R. first reportedin March, they say that they have till the end of June to vacate their spaces because their leases are not being renewed.

The brothers have petitions at their businesses, asking patrons to sign to convince the Nasser family, the longtime owners of the theater, and APE as the leaseholder of the three-unit building containing it and the coffee shop and nail salon to change their minds. A sign at the businesses also contains a QR code people can use to email the office of gay Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman, who as District 8 supervisor represents the Castro, at mandelmanstaff@sfgov.org.

Ken Khoury, 74, has had the coffee shop since 1987. Riyad Khoury, 78, opened the nail salon in 2004. The B.A.R. sat down with them for an interview at one of the coffee shop‚Äôs outdoor tables May 1.

‚ÄúThese businesses are essential,‚Äù Ken Khoury said. ‚ÄúYou take these businesses out, this part of the 400 block would be totally dead. Is this what the city wants? You‚Äôre taking a thriving business that serves the community for so long and just basically throwing it out. ‚Ä¶ I have five employees with dependents. How can I turn my back on them, and tell them to go away?‚Äù

Riyad Khoury added, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt evict an existing business that is successful and is serving the community. We‚Äôre part of the community. We are not like Walgreens. ‚Ä¶ We have relationships, stories we share together a long time.‚Äù

As of May 6, they‚Äôve gotten 900 signatures on the petitions. Six hundred of these have been sent to Mandelman‚Äôs office, Ken Khoury said.

Mandelman ‚Äì who nominated the nail salon for legacy business status earlier this year, which it attained ‚Äì told the B.A.R. on May 6 that, ‚ÄúI think APE and the Nassers should find a way for these two long-standing and beloved businesses to remain in the Castro.‚Äù

Asked if he was planning on meeting with the parties, or had already, Mandelman stated that he had.

Ken Khoury said he first learned there‚Äôd be a problem with renewing the lease in January, when he sat down with Chris Nasser to discuss its renewal.

Ken Khoury said Nasser told him that Bay Properties Inc. ‚Äì the company that owns the theater, of which he is the president ‚Äì could not renew the leases because the three-unit building containing it was leased to APE as of July 1.

The B.A.R. reached out to APE to ask what it had to say. An APE spokesperson confirmed the company will hold the master lease of the spaces as of July 1, and added that the brothers had been informed far in advance of January 2025 that their leases would not be renewed.

It was widely reported in 2022 that APE leased the theater itself when it took over management. The theater is currently undergoing a massive renovation and restoration project, to the tune of $35 million, according to APE. As the B.A.R. reported in February, the theater was originally supposed to be open this summer, but this has been pushed back to fall.

An email viewed by the B.A.R. confirms that Nasser stated that Bay Properties Inc. cannot extend the leases. He also stated he was working with APE on a resolution.

Indeed, the Nassers, APE, and the Khourys had a meeting at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium on March 18, though those negotiations did not result in a resolution all parties could agree upon.

‚ÄúAs of end of June, they [APE] will be the leaseholders,‚Äù Ken Khoury said. ‚ÄúWe suggested we sit down with them to talk about the new lease. What‚Äôs going to happen to us here?‚Äù",1,1746885105.0,sanfrancisco,2,0.56,False

Today we received an email from a travel agency warning us about some upcoming guests. The message described them as exigent and prone to complaining. Apparently, they‚Äôve been unhappy for their entire trip so far. Complaining about every single hotel they‚Äôve stayed at and every detail not exactly to their taste. They require a very specific floor, far from the elevators, with certain features, extra towels (two of each type), extra pillows, extra hangers, four types of coffee, bottles of water inside and outside the fridge‚Ä¶ the list goes on.

Last December I matched with a girl online and we kept chatting back and forth for around 3 weeks until I was back from my holiday abroad. We met twice within the first week, but because it was exam season we didn't manage to go out again until 2 weeks later. 

I pretty much was infatuated with her because I felt the same way I felt with all of the girls i ended up dating long term ( being comfortable, clicking instantly ). 

Mid way through the date she said she wanted to ask if I am ok with a non monogamous relationship, that she thought once about poly relationships and is trying to relearn non-mono. I asked if she was seeing anyone else rn and she said she was kind of seeing another guy and a girl. I asked her if that was a final decision and she said yes. I gave a hard no to a non-mono relationship. Yet because I enjoy our time together I just continued the date joking about the situation ( I use humor as a coping mechanism for myself ).

For some reason we just kept seeing each other anyway. Fast forward two weeks later ( ~2 months knowing each other ) on our 5th date at my place, I talked to her again about how I feel and that I expect more consistent time together or to stop seeing each other at all, as I wasn't feeling she was communicating anything to me.She said she doesn't know what she wants, I said ok, she said ""are you sure? Coz i won't like it if someone told me that"" and I responded that I don't like making impulsive decisions.

2 days later I break it off and tell her I like her and think we have a connection but since we have different wants it feels like I am risking myself getting hurt. We had a call on the phone two days later to let her know I don't hate her or anything I just don't think it would work out. She said that she didn't mean to make me feel unwanted and that feelings take time to develop. I told her yeah but you want a poly relationship and I can't give that. She offered friendship and I said i can't be friends with her coz I still have feelings.

We stopped talking for two months, yet I kept thinking about her all throughout. I couldn't keep dating other women coz she was constantly in my head. I felt like I made the right decision rationally but I felt like we didn't really have a chance to ""date"" each other.

I used to suffer from anxiety greatly but as I got older I got better at controlling it. The two months I spent in therapy as well helped me be ok with not projecting future scenarios on someone I don't even know yet. I stopped overthinking as much. I can actually live in the present now which on its own is worth the trouble haha.

I felt like shit tho for being handed the dumper role and being the one with more feelings. It felt unfair. I decided to reach out to her to reconnect as friends. I wanted to allow her to reject me entirely ( by saying no or ghosting ). To my surprise she replied two days later asking how am I and that it was nice to hear from me. And that we can ofc meet. We grabbed lunch together a week later and just chatted as if nothing happened. Caught up on life and therapy and how we are both trying to do better with anxiety. I invited her to coffee afterward and just chatted for an hour more before leaving. I didn't intend to schedule anything more but she said we will see each other again and I said yeah cool.

I have no idea what I want from this. I clearly still care for her and enjoy her company but I can't bring myself to lower my guard again if she still wants poly or isn't interested in me anymore. I held a grudge for the fact she waited until the 3rd date to say the poly thing or that she didn't try to just date and be open to mono if she liked me enough. I didn't even tell my friends about recontacting her because I feel a bit of shame and that part of my decision making was influenced by people around me encouraging whatever thought process I had at the time.

I get dates frequently but have trouble finding connection. How would you deal with this? I am still making my own decision but I feel like I want anonymous opinion from someone who isn't a friend.

Edit: by remaining friends I could either lose feelings over time or they become more intense, and then I would shoot my shot and be ok with her rejecting me.",1,1746883775.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1kjaayp,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kjaayp/uneven_bottomless_extraction_gaggia_classic_pro/,Uneven bottomless extraction [Gaggia Classic Pro],"Hello fellow espresso nerds. Hope you are well.

  
All my extractions look like this ([see video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VF7Txvq14c9GygiuLFhJyRJAd6zjOmfc/view?usp=drivesdk)). It seems like there‚Äôs coffee coming out of every hole in the basket, but for some reason the merging paths leave ‚Äúblank spots‚Äù on the basket, and I have never gotten that beautiful, 10/10, golden-looking espresso extraction. I get 1:2 in 25-30s, but I feel like I am missing out on flavor and on extractions looks - even though *looks* don‚Äôt tell the hole story in extraction. This particular video was a 1:2 in around 23s, and it tasted a little sour. But when I grind finer, even in 40s extractions, I get the same shot look (but of course with a different tasting cup). 

  
**Equipment:** I have a 2024 Gaggia Classic Evo Pro, with a 9bar spring; my grinder is a Kingrinder K6 (in setting 30, for this video); WDT from aliexpress; spring loaded self-leveling tamper from 3bomber; espresso scale; and I recently purchased a normcore bottomless portafilter, which came with an 18g basket.

**Dose:** I start at 18g and do the following for each new dial in: lock portafilter in and see at how many g of coffee the screw of the shower screen leaves a dent on the *dry* puck. Then, I reduce a little bit of coffee until that dent goes away, and that‚Äôs the dose I use. 

**Coffee**: this is a medium-dark roast roasted 15 days ago. But I get this same shot profile for other coffee roast levels and time off roast. 

**Puck Prep**: grind ‚Üí tap around portafilter to distribute ‚Üí WDT (circular, gentle, deep and then superficial) ‚Üí tamp ‚Üí top paper filter.

  
Now I have messed with bottom paper filter, bottom and top paper filter, poor man‚Äôs pre infusion for the GCP (Lance Hedrick‚Äôs video), different grind settings, different doses, etc. But I don‚Äôt seem to get that beautiful look that we associate with bottomless portafilters extractions. It‚Äôs driving me nuts and I am determined to do what it takes to get it to look good!

  
What am I missing? What do you think is the problem here? 

  
Thank you very much!

**A total of 8-9 years of casting LoL.**

**This video was a segment done on Pony's May 9th stream.**

  
KT vs. DNF



\- DNF are breaking all the bad records and getting attention for all the wrong reasons. The Freecs org's longest loss streak was 10 games, and they've now broke it with 11. They are now exploring the unknown, the first to conquer the uncharted frontier.

\- DNF are also the most influential team in the LCK now, because now it's more about which one of the 9 teams will lose to DNF, than DNF winning itself. The other 9 teams are literally playing hot potato with a jack-in-the-box that is DNF, with each DNF game day having teams go ""Is this bomb really going to go off on my face?""

\- It's not like DNF is an obvious dud either, right? We all know that they have the potential, and that they still can totally blow up in someone's face on a seemingly sunny day. They still have the innate individual skill and potential to suddenly turn everything around one day and go ""Hey, we're not bad anymore"". It's just that the day wasn't today. 

\- In a sense, it's kinda like playing Jenga where you want the tower to fall before your turn. The entire time you're going ""I hope the tower falls with that guy"" and ""Crap, is it really gonna be my turn again?"" at the same time. In this sense, DNF is creating a lot of suspense within the League, with all 9 teams taking turns facing DNF like they're defusing a rouge IED, and hoping the bomb goes off on another team's face instead of their own.



(In Korea, an 'undesirable' is referred to as a bomb, or Ìè≠ÌÉÑ. For example, on a group blind date, one side may refer to the most unattractive person from the other side as a 'bomb'. Then each side will flip a coin to see who will 'remove' the 'bomb' so the others can score, with the selected person being named the 'bomb disposal unit' or 'EOD'. 



DNF is currently being referred to as a 'bomb' by Pony and all the other Korean LCK casters, because DNF is a team that has nothing to lose, but all the other 9 teams have a lot to lose by being victim to DNF's first win. So they will use the term ""DNF is a bomb waiting to go off"" ""We will see if XYZ team can defuse DNF today"" ""The DNF bomb has successfully been moved over to ABC team"" ""This team is in big trouble if the DNF bomb goes off today"")



\- You know how the producers of Arcane use the contrast between Piltover and Zaun as a narrative device? You know, with Piltover being the upper-middle class suburbs, and Zaun being the cutthroat ghetto. With the three-meals-a-day, roof-over-their-heads aristocrats of comfy Piltover not being able to understand, or become accustomed to the dog-eat-dog world of Zaun the proletariat live in.

\- That's exactly how the divide of LCK and LCKCL works in my opinion, with LCK being Piltover and LCKCL being Zaun. People will usually write off LCK starting roster players going to CL as if they're taking a walk in the park, as a ""Oh they're gonna go smurf in low elo to regain their confidence."" That's not the case though. CL is no joke, in the sense that it's a place of constant, cutthroat competition. 

\- The entire point of sending players back down to CL, or places like TripleA in sports is to give underperforming players a chance to re-evaluate what works and what doesn't in a much 'coarse' environment. That's the entire thought process of players regaining confidence and refining their play in a lower-tier league. It's not them re-inflating egos by stomping low elo like most people think.



\- That being said, some players aren't able to survive the 'Zaun treatment'. The whole 'CL demotion to LCK re-promotion' thing doesn't always work out. However, it has worked out for a LOT of teams this year, including DNF's opponent, KT. KT's best case was Perfect, but it's also appropriate to say that it worked out for both Deokdam and Peter as well this season.

\- So I actually had high hopes coming in for DNF today, because I thought the CL treatment would have worked for DNF in Pyosik and Bulldog also. I also had a quick chat with Pyosik before the game today while getting coffee with Helios. I definitely sensed the ""We're gonna win today"" aura from him then, which made me go ""Is today the day?"" inside.



\- Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the DNF drafts today, though it might be because I'm looking at today's games in hindsight. For Game 1, the main problem I had with the DNF draft was that their topside of Rumble-Panth-Taliyah did not have good synergy with their Xayah-Rakan botlane. The draft isn't bad per se, but these kinds of two-part drafts are only really a luxury that stronger, higher-end teams can pull off. Stronger teams can afford to do this, because they can still pick a topside and botlane of total opposite colors, and still play out a winning game. Teams like DNF that don't have a definitive win condition or team identity can't afford to do this.

\- The Game 2 draft in my opinion was also kind of ehh, mainly because I still can't wrap my head around the Aatrox pick. Yeah, you CAN pick anything into Yorick, but did it HAVE to be Aatrox? Like why did it have to be Aatrox-Viktor, of all things - is where I'm getting at.

\- But I won't get any further into draft, because I like to think that players and coaches know best when it comes to draft. I am a 3rd-party spectator like everyone else, and I like to give teams the benefit of the doubt because of it.



\- The draft wasn't what made DNF lose today though. For Game 1, they had the famed Panth-Taliyah combo in their topside. As long as the key mechanism behind that combo remains the same, that combo is going to be relevant no matter what. However, there were no instances where DNF were able to effectively pull that combo off, or even properly incorporate Rumble ults into the Panth-Taliyah combo. 

\- Now, some people might doubt the effectiveness or synergy of the Panth-Taliyah combo. But we got to see exactly how powerful it was when used properly by Peanut and Zeka directly after, no? HLE proved to us precisely WHY the Pantheon is being picked as the best-response AD jungler when Vi+Xin are disabled, and WHY Taliyah is now being so highly prioritized as a first/blind pick.



\- For KT, they actually looked like GenG today against DNF. They picked the Jayce and Nidalee, won lane, won skirmishes, won standoffs, won objectives, won teamfights, etc. They won everything. 

\- This kind of gameplay they showed against DNF, along with the level of gameplay they showed against DK really warrants a re-evaluation of their current image. When isolating for two DK and DNF matches, KT weren't a rollercoaster at all. They weren't you wobbly, half-century old Six Flags wooden rollercoaster. They were in fact a luxury, first-class passenger trai.

\- That's how good KT's gameplay was today. Yes, there were small windows where Perfect was slightly down on gold as the Jayce. However, the current Rumble vs Jayce matchup isn't one that's incredibly favored towards the Jayce like a lot of people think. Especially when Rumble takes Comet.

\- Of course, the playing field DOES become a LOT more lopsided towards Jayce when it's played by Zeus or Kiin. However, the matchup itself is relatively even when it's a battle of Eastsides.

\- That's why I'm more than willing to give Perfect a pass on that matchup, because external factors like his team's overall gameplan and resource management made it so that he couldn't be as aggressive as the Jayce.

\- The last time we saw Perfect in a bad spot, it seemed like his 'game sense' was in a knot. What I mean by this is that he was unable to properly calculate how certain situations would play out, which would lead to him getting caught out or being ganked/dived. I think Perfect now stepping close to the line only when he can, and backing down in the face of imminent danger is a very good sign.



\- I don't want to go too overboard with the KT hype train. Not yet. Though I am glad that the team is now slowly getting back on track. The veterans are playing like veterans, and really performing their roles in-game. For a while, that was one of the issues with KT, right? It was the fact that the veterans in Cuzz and Deokdam looked no different than the likes of the younger players like Peter. Cuzz indeed DID have SOME highs, but not close to enough to where he was ever considered a win condition for KT.

\- That's why it was always Bdd. Thankfully, Bdd's back didn't break. He was able to hold as the team's last line of defense for nearly 6 weeks, and buy enough time for the rest of his team to get back on track.

\- It's the same story we see with KT and T1. It's Bdd for KT, and Oner for T1. They all had players that were able to keep their heads in the game until their teammates got their mojo flowing again.

\- For KT, I think this upwards trend is a very positive one. It's really up to KT in terms of what they can do with it, because everything from DRX to NS is really up for the taking. 3rd with T1 at 7 wins is a bit tough, but there's still a lot of room left for variance between 3 and 6 wins. 

\- What they have going for them can really be the start of what later gets them into playoffs, and even influence their Legend/Rise placements. It's always nice to see Bdd.



\- The opposite case of KT and T1, is of course DNF. The team that doesn't have that last resort. Yes, Berserker is Berserker, but he is an ADC. ADCs are just ADCs. That, and Berserker has also had some problems with his gameplay. 

\- Honestly, I can go on and on about what's wrong with DNF, but nothing good will come of it. At this point, they might even go for a soft reset where they start employing even more drastic measures. 

\- They tried changing their Jungler and Midlaner to no avail. So maybe they try switching other lanes, for the sake of making change. And yes, I know how their CL roster is doing, and how I always say that I am against seemingly random substitutions. But that just shows you how serious of a quandry DNF is in right now.

\- Of course, we can still laugh it off as ""Better luck next time"" or ""Lol 0-18 season"". However, I can't imagine how troubled things are internally within DNF at the moment.

\- For a while, a lot of the suspense with DNF for me was at least related to DNF, in the sense that it was always ""Are DNF finally going to rise to the occasion and get their first W?"" Now, the suspense surrounding DNF isn't related to them at all. It's now turned into this weird game where the suspense aspect comes from DNF's opponents. You know, in the context of ""Which team is going to get the backlash for messing up and giving DNF their first win?""

\- I'm not gonna go into this team any further. It's because I'm only going to go down this endless spiral of negativity. At this point, we've gone too deep into the season to point fingers and seperate goods and bads. There's simply no point in going ""Oh at least XYZ is still performing well"" or ""At least their ABC aspect is still good"". 

\- They need to be seen as a team in full crisis mode. They need to salvage what little hope they have left. 







HLE vs. BRO



\- This match was such a better watch than the one that came before it. Maybe it's a post-DNF effect kind of thing. However, to downplay BRO as only being 'good to watch' because of them playing after DNF is a little much. Honestly, I think I would have come to the exact same conclusions, and left this match with the same positive impression of BRO that I would've had if DNF didn't play today.

\- BRO do what they're supposed to do. They make the plays they're supposed to make, keep up with the game's tempo how they can, keep their promises as a team and try to play according to their game plan.

\- Honestly, I can go on for a while about the positives I see in BRO. However, they don't end up mattering all that much when it comes to facing teams like GEN and HLE. Why? It's because even Eastside teams on their good day simply cannot afford to make mistakes against a team like GenG. The moment an Eastside team makes one, ONE mistake against GenG, will cost them the game. That's why.



\- For Game 1, BRO was already kinda cooked the moment GenG's Panth-Taliyah started to get going. Since I've talked quite a bit on Panth-Taliyah, I'll talk a bit about Azir, since BRO picked it for Clozer as a handshake against Taliyah.

\- Azir is a good pick, and particularly has a good reputation among our LCK teams. We even have a proper noun called the ""Azir License"" in the LCK, since knowing how to play Azir well is pretty much considered a basic ability for all Korean midlaners. 

\- It's not like Azir isn't deserving of that reputation though. He fits into all sorts of team comps in draft, has a high ceiling, and also scales well. HOWEVER, I think it's becoming rather apparent that Azir does not do quite well into Taliyah. Even more than we thought in the past.

\- It's just that Azir really doesn't have a lot of options in terms of what he can do against Taliyah. Now, I think the overall theme of ""Azir can't catch up with Taliyah across the map"" was always true regardless of meta. That, and the fact that ""Oh, Azir can start to pressure Taliyah in lane post-6 with EmperorDivide all-ins."" 

\- That being said, the recent Taliyah-Azir matchups have shown way too many instances where the Taliyah simply stops Azir with her Lego bricks, or just keeps Azir perpetually shoved in with her superior laneclear. I've honestly seen this micro-level Taliyah-favored dynamic way too much on the prolevel recently to where I'm willing to consider it as default. All that, and the fact that Taliyah's skillset is just much better than Azir's in terms of 'making things happen' and intervening in other lanes. 

\- On a 1v1 level, Azir does fine in to Taliyah. The instances where you go ""Oh, the Azir lost to Taliyah"" in a laning phase context are still very, very rare. That's the thing though. League is a 5v5 team game, and Taliyah is just better-suited to win the 5v5 game.



\- So one may ask, ""Then why did BRO pick Azir when they know Taliyah is better, smartass?"" Well, you have to look at the bigger picture. First, there's the whole thing of denying Zeka and HLE the Azir, and the benefits they can enjoy because of it. Second, BRO is the underdog in the matchup, with Clozer being BRO's key player. Clozer is the guy that needs to really go above and beyond if BRO were to take a game against HLE. Clozer needed to be the guy performing multiple roles for his team, and a well-rounded, versatile champion like Azir is the best in that regard. Thus, I was able to understand the idea behind why BRO opted into Azir in the Taliyah-Azir handshake for Clozer in draft. 

\- This all goes back to why I said Game 1 was kinda cooked as soon as the Panth-Taliyah started getting ahead though. Yes, BRO did have a good start to the game where Morgan burned Zeus's Flash and all. However, BRO just weren't able to keep up in a game where they are constantly skirmishing against a team like HLE. As an Eastside team, it's really hard to come out ahead, or barely even stay even in this kind of game. 

\- Unfortunately for BRO, it was HLE's Panth-Taliyah that just so happened to reap all the benefits in terms of gold and XP in those series of skirmishes. That's when I really felt the game was over. Why? It's because HLE are of a caliber that I 100% know will, and can utilize the global aspect of Taliyah at the highest level.

\- And that's exactly what you saw. While BRO were only using 1 portion of the map, HLE were using 2 based off of Taliyah and Pantheon. That's where the lead really started to grow in HLE's favor. It was this specific moment where BRO suddenly became late to every objective, and were always less inefficient than HLE in terms of resource allocation.

\- HLE just started doing this blitzkrieg style where they started blinking from place to place across the map, all while BRO were desperate to play catchup. BRO were inevitably bound to leak gold and resources around the map because of it - which led to HLE's victory in the end.



\- Ah yes. I'll talk a bit about the 25.09 nerfs a bit, specifically on Gwen, Naafiri and Kalista. Yes, those three meta champions were nerfed. And yes, the relevant numbers weren't ones you could just brush off as insignificant. 

\- However, the thing with these kinds of meta champions is that they will never really fall out of proplay as long as they're still able to fulfill the roles they were picked for. That, and the fact that no other champions of similar capabilities have risen up to take their place.

\- For Gwen, Gwen is really still just Gwen. Once she gets her items, the nerfs become kind of irrelevant because they don't impede her from doing Gwen things. Same thing with Naafiri. For Kalista, Kalista is still Kalista later on in Kalista-favored fights despite her early laning taking a hit. All that, and the fact that no other champions have really been buffed to where they can take over Gwen/Naafiri/Kalista's spots in the meta and render them obsolete.



\- For Game 2, I want to talk a bit about the botlane. Specifically BRO's MF-Braum into HLE's Ezreal-Karma. Honestly, I kinda feel for Hype and BRO's botlane in Game 2. I'll explain why.

\- This is something that goes for both proplay, and SoloQ alike. For SoloQ, it also applies to all elos. When you play against skillshot-heavy, poke-based lanes like Ezreal-Karma, you know when you get pressured SO hard to where you kind of shrink in a way, and turtle in more than you're supposed to?

\- That happens to us all in SoloQ, and I think that's what exactly happened to BRO's botlane. And it really is a testament to how intensive that lane matchup was played out on HLE's end. From the early game, there were so many instances where Viper would just ArcaneShift forwards in the most aggressive way possible to push Hype and Pollu back. It happened again, and again, and again so many times to where Hype and Pollu were kind of conditioned into wincing back whenever they met Viper and Delight in lane.

\- That's the double-edged swords of the poke-heavy botlanes like Ezreal-Karma, right? And the everything-or-nothing nature of these lanes are why they aren't picked as often in proplay. The poke-heavy nature makes the combo inherently annoying, but there's a very big difference between a fruit fly and a hornet buzzing in front of your face. For BRO, Viper and Delight's Ezreal-Karma lane was essentially a hornet.

\- The fact that BRO played Braum into the matchup made it so much worse. Of course, Braum is a good champion. But he's a CONDITIONALLY good champion. In instances where a team needs raw engage or lane prio, Braum really doesn't have much to show in those areas. That's why Braum is never really picked blind in SoloQ, because the enemy will just have a field day by perma-poking you with Karma or Xerath.

\- I'm not saying that BRO's botlane got stomped. Instead, I'm approaching it from more of a psychological angle. The reason why is that from Hype and Pollu's play in Game 2, it really did seem like that the hyper-oppressive nature of Viper and Delight really made it into Hype and Pollu's conscious mind. It really did seem like the MF was playing as if Hype had the image of Viper ArcaneShifting forwards to poke him was living rent-free inside his head.

\- That's really just what happens when you get so heavily poked down by a top-notch Ezreal-Karma in lane though. So Viper and Delight did a really good job in that regard.



\- For HLE, I did start to notice a pattern in Game 2 though. It's that HLE start drafting incredibly risky whenever they get banished to Redside. It's not even a subtlet thing where they're sort of doing it either. They blatantly just take incredibly risky picks and comps whenever they get Redside after winning Game 1. This also extends to their gameplay too, where they take extremely risky comps and play an extremely risky style with them in-game.

\- In my opinion though, it's not severe to where I will condemn this kind of behavior as throwing or inting. It's still within the bounds of where I can still say ""They're collecting data during the regular season while they still can"". You know, in terms of experimenting with various champions and testing out different matchups.

\- I did say their drafts were risky, but it's still very much within the bounds of 'experimental'. They never really do cross into the territory of ""Ok, now you're just throwing."" Though risky and experimental, you can still guess a rational thought process behind why HLE might have drafted they way they did.

\- At the end of the day, they're not losing games because of it. And since it's still the regular season, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.



\- The fact of the matter is, I would actually be a lot more critical of HLE if they were doing this 'risky & experimental' kind of thing every once in a while. In a way, I actually feel a lot more favorable towards it since they're doing it somewhat regularly.

\- Think about it this way. Let's take Nidalee Top for example. If they picked it against DRX that one time and never played it ever again, I would actually view that game as a wasted opportunity, and be more willing to scold HLE for it. 

\- However, they did it again. That means that it's no longer a one time thing - with HLE getting a bigger Nidalee Top sample size of their own, and a lot more live gameplay for them to analyze for the future.

\- On this note, Dandy is actually very well-suited for this kind of strategy. He's kind of the dad that coddles his kids and buys them whatever they ask for. He's not the kind of person to shut players down when they say ""I want to play this"" during draft.

\- I get that the viewership and the HLE fandom might feel a lot differently about this though. The reason being fans just wanting their team to win in the most decisive way possible, since aspects like experimentation and data collection are behind-the-scenes elements that casual viewers don't really care for.

\- That's the take I had for HLE and Zeka's Yone pick into Clozer's Ahri in Game 2 as well. Like we all saw, Zeka's Yone was pressured really hard in lane by Clozer's Ahri early on. Like really hard. However, I feel like HLE did pick that Yone despite the losing matchup to limit test a bit. in terms of trying to test out how a 25.09 nerfed Yone will do against an Ahri in lane on the new patch.



\- Despite the ups and downs, it was really a very typical GenG+HLE vs. Eastside matchup. For a while, all these matchups have gone in 2 ways. One, is where GenG and HLE just dominate from the early game all the way until the end of the game. Two, is where the Eastside team is able to secure a lead early on, but inevitably gives GenG or HLE the game-breaking opening because they cannot balloon their leads without making mistakes. Today was just the second case.",2,1746883276.0,leagueoflegends,0,0.75,False

How do I let go of her while still being a good father?

Let me preface this with i finally got ahold of her spending history and put it in context with mine. She makes about 2/3 what i make, and together make right about $200k. We split expenses pretty much 60/40, so i think thats been very fair. But over the last year, she spent over 90% of her discretionary spending on herself. That by itself wouldnt bother me if she wasnt also racking up about $5k a year in debt that i end up having to pay for. But i notice that i spent about 75% of my discretionary spending on her (gifts, me covering dinner or hotel or event tickets, etc.). I do it because I've been chasing her happiness, and i had believed that she'd find enough of it to appreciate all that i do for her and she'd be focused on me. It hasn't worked out that way at all.

My wife has put minimal interest in me over the last three years, with a driving focus on how she just wont be happy until she has a kid. She's had breakdowns where she lashed out and verbally abused me. I forgave her, never once retaliated physically or verbally. Now she's pregnant and its all she thinks or talks about and I can already see on the wall that despite her claims, I will now never be the priority in her life that I've wanted to be. Obviously thats my doing, I was so fixated on what she wanted (cosmetic procedures, fleeting hobbies, instagr envy) that I would do what i could to give her everthing she wanted and i stopped prioritizing my own ambitions and desires. Now I'm reeling with the reality that my number one desire (being her number one priority as much as she is mine) is unattainable now and forever, except maybe in old age when we're both tired, ugly, on fixed income, and have little in common anymore. By then I will be just more of what im feeling like I've been lately - just a comvenience.

I've talked with her about it. Mentioned the juxtaposition between how we used to be and how we are, understood her reasons, and she promises better for us. But we've had conversations like this over the last year and she's like an NPC in a video game with a dialogue prompt that's always available. You can have that conversation a million times, but once its done, its as if it's never happened. To her, its talked about so its solved, which is mind-bending because she KNOWS that I know that's not how it works with her. How could she think I would be so simple?

Now with the kid on the way, all she wants is sympathy for how sick she feels or how uncomfortable she is (which I told her countless times how rough it can be, not knowing personally of course, but knowing its not like the imstagram posts she watches). She also just keeps fantasizing about all the walks she'll go on, coffee shop visits, whatever, just her and baby living the life she dreamed, except that dream doesn't involve me too often beyond playing a supportive role, although it does involve all of our discretionary funds since im letting her do the stay at home thing for two years.

I want to be positive, but I can't shake this depression I've picked up since finding out she was actually pregnant. I just wasn't thinking that my happiness would never for a moment be the number one priority (or even number two it seems) once she had what she said she needed to feel satisfied. My gut feeling is that I dont want the kid, but part of me does, and my fears absolve when I can tell myself as long as she's happy to make me a priority this will all be worth it. But I know how she is, and I am so fearful about being right about how she will be. I'll be the cash machine that can take care of the honey-do list, which is much larger than most people's because I am extremely handy and she's sort of devolves into a potato anytime she's even slightly uncomfortable (I dont remember anyone describing children as ""comfortable).

I need to stop chasing her dreams and start chasing mine now because she's gotten so much at my expense and my first desire is all but impossible now, and the rest will take so much time and money that I'll no longer have easily. I want to be a good father and an acceptable husband. My desire for her attention and not getting it pisses me off and makes me mean. Just this morning I try to have a conversation about it again and she turns the TV on and says she doesn't want to talk about it. I feel bad that I can't be more caring for her during pregnancy, but I feel hurt every time I'm around her and her complaints of discomfort just make me want to say ""you got what you wanted, can't you just be happy?"" How do I distance myself from her emotionally so I can stop being depressed about all of this and stop being an ass? It is driving me to tears.",0,1746883188.0,Marriage,9,0.5,False

**The Morning After¬†-** April 2021  
Everett D‚ÄôAvenford woke up on the couch, fully clothed, his perfectly pressed suit and shirt now crumpled. His tie hung around his neck like a loose noose, the faint impression of a throw pillow etched into his cheek.

He blinked once. Twice. He was home.

No calendar alert or angry voicemail to suggest he‚Äôd missed a meeting, yet he couldn‚Äôt shake the sense that something important had slipped past him. The sour tang of vodka-sodas lingered on his tongue, and the deep wrinkles in his designer suit revealed a gap in the story his memory refused to fill in.

His West Village apartment, a neat demonstration of minimalist restraint, was still and quiet. He rolled off the leather couch, stretched, and shuffled toward the kitchen. His mind, still foggy, ran the usual morning-after checklist: no embarrassing texts, no blood on his shirt, phone charging. Could be worse.

He ground fresh beans, filled the kettle, and queued up music on his smart speaker. After a moment‚Äôs thought, he skipped over Obsession by Animotion and landed on Egyptian Reggae. The rhythm of the bass and percussion instruments filled the space with a low-key, irreverent groove. It didn‚Äôt make sense. He liked that.

As the kettle hissed to a boil, Everett checked his messages. A few meeting confirmations. One text from his assistant: ‚ÄúTokyo call pushed again? Something about a holiday or... etiquette thing?‚Äù Everett frowned.

He turned toward the bathroom, half-unbuttoned, but stopped cold. Someone was in his apartment.

‚ÄúThere you are. I was beginning to think sleep was your favorite dimension.‚Äù

**The hall is rented, the orchestra engaged. It's now time to see if you can dance**  
Everett froze, half-buttoned shirt hanging open. Sitting on his sleek black couch, legs crossed, was the man‚Ä¶ no, the being he'd met last night, Veldrik. He just sat there, relaxed, dressed in a minimalist, timeless suit and a black tailored coat without as much as a wrinkle.

Veldrik held a mug Everett didn't own. ‚ÄúCoffee's underwhelming,‚Äù he said, taking a sip.

Everett blinked. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be real‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúReal is such a... trivial concept, I expected you to ask me less limiting questions.‚Äù

The TV turned on with a hum. Grainy footage from a street corner played on loop. A woman stepped into a crosswalk. A car sped forward. A glitch, the footage rewound, played again. In the new version, she crossed safely. The car braked at the stoplight.

Everett could only stare.

‚ÄúYou did that,‚Äù Veldrik said. ‚ÄúYour first correction.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought that was a dream.‚Äù Was the only thing Everett could mutter.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. Dreaming is just intentions wearing fancy outfits.‚Äù He sipped again. ‚ÄúWhat matters is‚Ä¶ it worked.‚Äù

**A Game Worth Playing**  
Veldrik leaned back. ‚ÄúTry something else, something fun, entertain yourself.‚Äù

Everett stared at the shapeshifting artifact on the table. He had missed it before. ‚ÄúFun? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not a toy.‚Äù

Veldrik shrugged. ‚ÄúAnd yet, here it is, in your apartment, and it has so much potential. Are you one for ignoring potential? Opportunity, Everett?‚Äù

Triggered, the word ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù stuck. Everett sat forward, curiosity sharpening. He focused. The mug Veldrik had been holding twisted 90 degrees in place, then returned. The coaster beneath it turned into an origami swan and flew away.

Everett smirked, just a little, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù He looked around. Focused on the side table. Concentrated. It shifted two inches to the left.

‚ÄúVery feng shui of you,‚Äù Veldrik muttered.

He tried again. The couch rotated 45 degrees. A lamp hovered, then gently dropped.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get ambitious,‚Äù Veldrik encouraged.

Everett thought of something absurd, a prank, maybe. A low-stakes test. He looked out on 9th¬†Ave. Below, a man walked briskly, coffee in hand. He had that kind of rugged, cynical cop-look.

A pie appeared mid-air. It hovered for a half-second, then launched in a perfect arc.

THWACK.

From below: ‚ÄúAre you kidding me?! Who throws a goddamn pie from a window?!""

Everett winced. Veldrik grinned.

Buoyed by success, Everett turned inward. He began to redesign his space. The sofa reupholstered itself in deep navy velvet. The rug became Persian, intricate and lush. The bookshelves aligned with unnatural symmetry.

The mugs in the closet were perfectly aligned, the cracks in the minimalist plates disappeared and got replaced by gorgeous Kintsugi plates.

The wall across from him rippled, the plaster changed into wonderful, exposed brick. It shimmered like TV snow, then cleared to reveal the room of the apartment next door.

Through the wall, he saw his neighbor‚Ä¶ kissing a woman who was definitely not his wife.

They froze. The man looked up. Locked eyes with Everett.

Everett flinched and chuckled uncomfortably before he tried to close it, pouring thought and effort into sealing the tear. The edges of the wall shimmered and solidified.

His knees buckled. He stumbled backward, collapsing onto his newly redesigned rug. Sweat beaded at his temples. His hands trembled.

From the other side of the wall, muffled shouting:

‚ÄúI told you to close the blinds!‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought I did!‚Äù

‚ÄúNow the guy with the expensive rugs thinks we‚Äôre scumbags!‚Äù

‚ÄúImpressive restraint,‚Äù Veldrik said. ‚ÄúMost people would‚Äôve turned her into a goldfish.‚Äù Veldrik knelt beside him. ‚ÄúEverything costs something, Everett. Even improvement. Especially improvement.‚Äù

1kja216,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyLive/comments/1kja216/does_blunon_nuts_snack_pack_deliver_healthy/,Does Blunon Nuts Snack Pack Deliver Healthy Variety? Comprehensive Review Inside,"Blunon B099BR9R2F Nuts Snack Packs came into my life as a simple purchase for road trips and workday snacking. And let's be honest, snacks are a critical part of surviving both. These mixed nuts and trail mix individual packs promised convenience with their grab-and-go style, so I was curious to see if they would truly live up to the hype.

**Portability and Design**  
The first thing that made an impression was the compact packaging. Each of the 28 individual packs came neatly sealed, perfectly sized for a purse, glove box, or even my jacket pocket. There‚Äôs a certain satisfaction in having a mess-free snack option that doesn't require zip-lock bags or extra storage containers. I could easily grab one before leaving for work or toss a few into my bag for a hike with friends. Everything stayed fresh and intact, thanks to the portioned packets.

**Flavor Variety and Taste**  
What truly excited me was the diversity of flavors. From the sweetness of cranberry health mix to the rich saltiness of Planters salted cashews, there‚Äôs a little bit of everything for every kind of craving. The assortment included some popular brands like Wonderful Pistachios and Blue Diamond Almonds, which meant I wasn‚Äôt compromising on taste or quality. Sure, I'm guilty of eating two packs back-to-back on stressful days, but the balance between salty, sweet, and crunchy was well worth it.

**Highlights**  
- Convenient single-serving packets perfect for on-the-go snacking.  
- A variety of brands and flavors to suit different taste preferences.  
- Packaging ensures freshness and avoids spills or messes.  

[Check Blunon B099BR9R2F price on Amazon.](https://theveggieshop.com/p/b099br9r2f/)

**Texture and Freshness**  
I admit I was skeptical about how fresh the nuts and mixes would taste. Stale nuts can ruin even the best brands. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that these stayed crunchy and flavorful, even for packs I stashed away and forgot about for a few weeks. The cranberry health mix, in particular, had a balance of tanginess and sweetness that didn‚Äôt overpower the natural nut flavors. The roasted pistachios and cashews paired with raisins, sunflower seeds, and almonds made for a great, balanced snack.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- While the packs are a good portion size, some felt a bit too small for my bigger snack cravings.  
- A few packets contained substitution items due to supply chain issues, which was a bit disappointing when I was expecting a specific flavor.  
- Not every flavor was consistent in ratio; for example, some trail mixes felt overloaded with raisins.

**Customizability for Needs**  
If you‚Äôre like me and prefer specific snacks to match certain cravings, the included variety should handle most of your needs. There were days when I wanted something more sweet-leaning and turned to the honey-roasted peanuts, while the salted almonds were my go-to with my morning coffee. It‚Äôs perfect for kids too. My nephew loves the salted peanuts and always asks me to toss a few packs into his lunchbox.

**Healthy Snacking Option**  
One significant point in the favor of these snack packs is how they cater to my ‚Äúeat healthier‚Äù goals. Each pack is portion-controlled, which means no mindless binging straight out of a giant bag of nuts. It‚Äôs a lifesaver for anyone wanting to enjoy snacks without overindulging. Plus, the natural mix of protein and good fats in options like walnuts and pistachios made it a smarter choice when compared to chips or candy bars.

**Competing Products**  
When lined up against other snack packs like NatureBox or Trader Joe's nut mixes, Blunon stands out for one primary reason: variety within the pack. Most competitors tend to focus on repetitive flavors or single-brand inclusions. The inclusion of brands like Planters and Wonderful feels intentional and ensures you're not stuck with a singular taste profile. However, some competitors could edge ahead in terms of having bigger pack sizes or flavor exclusivity, which is something Blunon might want to address.

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of value, this product delivers. With 28 packs in one box, I genuinely felt I got my money's worth. Not every single snack pack was life-changing, but the overall variety and quality made it an easy investment for my pantry and road trips‚Äô snacking needs.

**The Morning After¬†-** April 2021

Everett D‚ÄôAvenford woke up on the couch, fully clothed, his perfectly pressed suit and shirt now crumpled. His tie hung around his neck like a loose noose, the faint impression of a throw pillow etched into his cheek.

He blinked once. Twice. He was home.

No calendar alert or angry voicemail to suggest he‚Äôd missed a meeting, yet he couldn‚Äôt shake the sense that something important had slipped past him. The sour tang of vodka-sodas lingered on his tongue, and the deep wrinkles in his designer suit revealed a gap in the story his memory refused to fill in.

His West Village apartment, a neat demonstration of minimalist restraint, was still and quiet. He rolled off the leather couch, stretched, and shuffled toward the kitchen. His mind, still foggy, ran the usual morning-after checklist: no embarrassing texts, no blood on his shirt, phone charging. Could be worse.

He ground fresh beans, filled the kettle, and queued up music on his smart speaker. After a moment‚Äôs thought, he skipped over Obsession by Animotion and landed on Egyptian Reggae. The rhythm of the bass and percussion instruments filled the space with a low-key, irreverent groove. It didn‚Äôt make sense. He liked that.

As the kettle hissed to a boil, Everett checked his messages. A few meeting confirmations. One text from his assistant: ‚ÄúTokyo call pushed again? Something about a holiday or... etiquette thing?‚Äù Everett frowned.

He turned toward the bathroom, half-unbuttoned, but stopped cold. Someone was in his apartment.

‚ÄúThere you are. I was beginning to think sleep was your favorite dimension.‚Äù

The hall is rented, the orchestra engaged. It's now time to see if you can dance

Everett froze, half-buttoned shirt hanging open. Sitting on his sleek black couch, legs crossed, was the man‚Ä¶ no, the being he'd met last night, Veldrik. He just sat there, relaxed, dressed in a minimalist, timeless suit and a black tailored coat without as much as a wrinkle.

Veldrik held a mug Everett didn't own. ‚ÄúCoffee's underwhelming,‚Äù he said, taking a sip.

Everett blinked. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be real‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúReal is such a... trivial concept, I expected you to ask me less limiting questions.‚Äù

The TV turned on with a hum. Grainy footage from a street corner played on loop. A woman stepped into a crosswalk. A car sped forward. A glitch, the footage rewound, played again. In the new version, she crossed safely. The car braked at the stoplight.

Everett could only stare.

‚ÄúYou did that,‚Äù Veldrik said. ‚ÄúYour first correction.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought that was a dream.‚Äù Was the only thing Everett could mutter.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. Dreaming is just intentions wearing fancy outfits.‚Äù He sipped again. ‚ÄúWhat matters is‚Ä¶ it worked.‚Äù

A Game Worth Playing  
Veldrik leaned back. ‚ÄúTry something else, something fun, entertain yourself.‚Äù

Everett stared at the shapeshifting artifact on the table. He had missed it before. ‚ÄúFun? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not a toy.‚Äù

Veldrik shrugged. ‚ÄúAnd yet, here it is, in your apartment, and it has so much potential. Are you one for ignoring potential? Opportunity, Everett?‚Äù

Triggered, the word ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù stuck. Everett sat forward, curiosity sharpening. He focused. The mug Veldrik had been holding twisted 90 degrees in place, then returned. The coaster beneath it turned into an origami swan and flew away.

It never got physical at least that‚Äôs what he says  and maybe I believe him, maybe I don‚Äôt. I found the texts late one night when he left his phone face-up on the bathroom counter. Long, poetic things. Laughing at inside jokes. Sharing secrets. He told her he dreamt about her. He told her she made him feel alive again.

It broke something in me.

We fought, cried, screamed. He apologized, begged, went to therapy, promised it would never happen again. I didn‚Äôt leave. I told him I forgave him.

But I don‚Äôt think I did.

I still smile when he walks into the room. I still make his coffee the way he likes it. I still lay next to him every night and tell him I love him. But there‚Äôs a small, quiet part of me that never came back  a piece I didn‚Äôt realize he took with him when he gave someone else what I thought was ours.

I think about her sometimes. I‚Äôve never met her, but she‚Äôs burned into my mind. I wonder if she knew. I wonder if she cared. I wonder if she thinks of him now.

We just bought a house together. Our life is full of normal things  grocery lists, weekend chores, dinner with friends. It‚Äôs fine. Good, even. But when he kisses me goodbye in the morning, there‚Äôs still that flicker of old hurt that whispers, *You weren‚Äôt enough once. What makes you think you are now?*

Keep it up everyone, it's very helpful to read these stories and to see the support that is offered to a near strangers.

  
I personally don't even know how or where to begin.  I suffer from trauma related to past drug use/withdrawals, a fentanyl overdose, and other things that aren't particularly relevant to this conversation.  I've been addicted to nicotine since my early teenage years.  Now, I'm 41yo and 8 years into my daily Zyn habit.

My ""quit date"" has been a moving target for years...maybe even decades.  I'm at the point where I tuck a 6mg cinnamon Zyn (my favorite) nearly 24-7.  I wake up multiple times a night to spit out the old and put in a new one.  I tuck one in with my morning coffee and nearly every moment of every day.

  
Now adays, I'm on a host of psychiatric meds to deal with the anxiety, the sleeplessness, the depression, the stomach cramps, etc.  None of these I've attributed to the Zyns, but I'm not even sure I would need these medications in the absence of Zyn.

  
In my personal life, I'm the first person to offer a hand to a friend, or even a stranger, and the last person to ask for help.  In this moment, I don't know what else to do other than to participate in this community and ask for help, finally.  Whether that's simple advice or words of encouragement.  I would just really appreciate knowing that I'm not alone and that there is a possibility of moving forwards without this chemical dependence.

As someone who drinks coffee religiously every morning, testing the BLACK+DECKER CM1070B-1 Programmable Coffeemaker quickly became a part of my daily ritual. Its sleek black finish looks right at home on my kitchen counter, and the compact design at 10.3"" x 7.8"" x 12"" doesn‚Äôt dominate the space. This coffeemaker, designed for everyday use, offers several features that cater well to coffee enthusiasts seeking both practicality and performance.  

**Design and Usability**  

Visually, the product doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It embraces a modern, minimalistic aesthetic, perfect for any kitchen layout. Buttons are used for the interface, and the ‚ÄúQuickTouch‚Äù programming is remarkably straightforward. I was able to set the auto-brew timer with ease, ensuring my coffee was ready first thing in the morning. The fully automatic operation is a huge plus, especially on rushed mornings.  

Cleaning this machine takes minimal effort. The removable brew basket, compatible with basket-style paper filters, can even go into the dishwasher. While I‚Äôm not someone who rejoices over dishwasher compatibility, my spouse was thrilled‚Äîit saves a good chunk of time.

**Performance and Brewing Features**  

When it comes to brewing, this coffeemaker shines. The Vortex Technology Showerhead is one of the standout features, evenly saturating the grounds for consistent, flavorful coffee extraction. I‚Äôve noticed smoother cups of coffee compared to my old machine, which sometimes left unevenly brewed patches in the filter.  

Its ‚ÄúSneak-A-Cup‚Äù technology might be my new favorite feature. There have been countless mornings when patience was lacking, and being able to pour a cup mid-brew without causing coffee waterfalls on my counter is a game-changer. Thanks to this, I can now sip peaceably while the rest of the pot finishes brewing.  

[Check BLACK+DECKER CM1070B-1 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b08pcb2hd3/)

**Key Benefits**  

- Includes a programmable timer that simplifies early mornings.  
- Vortex Technology ensures even coffee extraction for a richer flavor.  
- Sneak-A-Cup feature prevents spills while getting that quick pour mid-brew.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

- The exterior feels a bit lightweight. While it hasn‚Äôt dented or scratched yet, I‚Äôd have preferred materials that seemed sturdier.  
- It lacks any customizable temperature control settings. For those who like their coffee scalding hot or slightly warmer, some adjustment options wouldn‚Äôt hurt.  
- The paper filter design could be a dealbreaker for those who prefer reusable mesh filters; it‚Äôs something to keep in mind before purchasing.  

**Rival Brands**  

Comparing this to other coffee machines like the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 or the Keurig K-Elite, the BLACK+DECKER unit holds its ground well in terms of basic brewing functionality. The programmable timer is better executed here than on budget competitors, making it undeniably more user-friendly. However, brands like Keurig shine when it comes to features like single-cup capabilities or reusable pod systems, catering better to smaller households or solo coffee drinkers. Where this programmable coffeemaker beats many others is affordability and simplicity‚Äîno superfluous bells and whistles to complicate your mornings.  

**Quality for Price**  

For what you‚Äôre paying, this product provides impressive feature depth and solid quality. It‚Äôs not a high-end or luxury machine, but that‚Äôs what makes it so appealing. The BLACK+DECKER CM1070B-1 balances functionality with straightforward design to deliver a solid brewing experience every day. As someone who frequently tests coffeemakers, I‚Äôd say this lands squarely in the middle for performance versus financial value.

We ended up chatting while waiting for our drinks, bonding over our mutual klutziness. Turns out he's dropped an entire tray of lattes before, so he gets it! As I grabbed my to-go cup, he waved and said, ""Hope your day is less... spill-tacular!""

It's kinda weird how a silly spill led to such a cute little exchange. Anyone else ever have one of those random moments that just makes your day? ‚ò∫Ô∏è",2,1746882255.0,GentleFlirtations,0,1.0,False

1kj9ro7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1kj9ro7/how_to_build_a_faithfocused_business_network/,How to Build a Faith-Focused Business Network,"Finding like-minded entrepreneurs is not just about networking; it‚Äôs more akin to dating, minus the awkward silences and the need to impress with your culinary skills. It‚Äôs about seeking out those who resonate with your hopes, dreams, and‚Äîlet‚Äôs be honest‚Äîa few of your quirks (because who doesn‚Äôt have a few?). Here‚Äôs how to navigate this wild landscape and build relationships that actually lift you up.

First, start with passion-project communities. Think of your interests as a buffet; taste-test everything from local meetups to online forums, and don‚Äôt shy away from those weirdo niches you find intriguing. If you‚Äôre obsessed with artisanal cheese-making (and who wouldn‚Äôt be?), jump into local cheese clubs or join Facebook groups centered around it. You‚Äôll be surprised by the kindred spirits you'll meet‚Äîoften over a shared plate of brie.

Once you‚Äôre in the room (or on the screen) with other entrepreneurs, don‚Äôt just stand there awkwardly clutching your phone. Engage! Ask questions that matter‚Äîwhat fires them up, why did they choose to become entrepreneurs, what's their biggest struggle? These questions not only spark genuine conversation but might just lead to a gem of insight or a collaborative idea. Remember, most entrepreneurs are just a little lost, and your willingness to be open can make a world of difference.

Now, here‚Äôs where I get a little vulnerable. Sometimes, we get so wrapped up in our pursuits that we forget to check in with our mental health or even look up from our screens. Be intentional about creating these relationships by scheduling regular catch-ups. Whether it's a coffee chat or a Zoom lunch, committing to a specific time keeps the connection alive. Make it a habit‚Äîmuch like that mid-week laundry you keep meaning to do‚Äîit‚Äôs crucial to nurture these relationships.

While you‚Äôre building this entrepreneurial crew, don‚Äôt forget to offer support. This isn‚Äôt a one-way street, and the best way to cultivate these connections is to uplift others. If you hear of an opportunity or a relevant resource, share it! Maybe someone needs a recommendation, or even some moral support‚Äîit goes a long way. Trust me, the universe has a funny way of returning the favor when you extend a helping hand.

And my final bit of advice (the cherry on top, if you will) is to remain spiritually grounded throughout this process. Ask God for guidance in your entrepreneurial journey. Seek His wisdom as you connect with others. Trust that He puts people in your path for a reason, and be open to the lessons He wants you to learn through these interactions. Reflecting on Proverbs 27:17 could be your secret weapon here: ‚ÄúIron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another.‚Äù So sharpen away‚Äîwith joy and laughter, and watch how your circle begins to transform into an incredible support network.

So, go out there! Embrace the awkward, lean into the laughter, and remember, it‚Äôs all about finding your tribe. You‚Äôve got this!",1,1746882095.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

(please please don't say ""nothing"")","I finished my 2nd playthrough, this time with a more open mind. Since Bioware were gutted and getting mad at people who already lost their jobs felt kinda unnecessary, I ended up enjoying myself more. It's still not the game I wanted, I basically treat it in my mind as an AU rather than Dragon Age 4, but it's a game I can confidently say that I like. 

I enjoyed the moment-to-moment gameplay. The combat is great as a rogue. Bioware people said lots of bullshit for marketing purposes but when Mark Darrah said it's the first DA where the combat is out of the ""it's not THAT bad"" territory. I'd love to have a third companion and less visual clutter but they did a good job here. Same about the gear and skills system. Build crafting and exploration were never this fun before and Veilguard is a game that really rewards turning over every rock and looking behind waterfalls (literally).

I enjoyed each companion. I don't think any of them make it to my top 10 DA characters, but I only have warm feelings for each one of them bar Lucanis (one more word about coffee and I'll fucking kill you).

I enjoyed the scenery. Major characters look good, but the environments and lighting are a work of art. I took many screenshots,[ here are some of my favourites (spoilers included!)](https://imgur.com/a/adwxie6)

I enjoyed every moment Solas was on screen. I'm certain some would hate that but I wish he were more present, like Johnny Silverhand rather than the Illusive Man. He stole the show every time he showed up and I've never felt so betrayed by a character before even though I was expecting it.

I enjoyed the main villains, not for the writing, but for amazing acting and presentation. Joseph Capp delivered ""egomaniacal god of vengeance"" perfectly and people who came up and modeled Ghilan'nain with all the gross details like an eye socket with teeth are geniuses.

Finally I enjoyed everything after the point of no return. Doing it in for the first time in one sitting was an emotional rollercoaster I will not forget. You can tell they took the criticism of Inquisition's finale to heart and made sure not to repeat that. In my opinion it's Bioware's best work since Mass Effect 2 and I'm happy that Dragon Age went out in blaze of glory (kind of).

# Introduction: Transforming Creativity into Cinematic Magic

I‚Äôve been in the creative space for a while now, and if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve heard time and time again, it‚Äôs the sheer frustration that comes with trying to bring big cinematic ideas to life. For so long, creating stunning CGI and VFX felt like a distant dream, locked away behind expensive software, complicated interfaces, and the need for years of specialized training. I can‚Äôt tell you how many brilliant concepts I‚Äôve seen get shelved simply because the tools were too intimidating or the costs too prohibitive. It‚Äôs a common roadblock, and one that has, frankly, held back a lot of potential.

That‚Äôs why I was so incredibly excited when I first came across AI CGI-VFX Studio. This isn‚Äôt just another tool; it‚Äôs what I can only describe as a revolution for creators like us. It‚Äôs a beginner-friendly AI-powered platform designed to completely simplify the creation of high-end, Hollywood-style CGI and VFX. Imagine being able to take those grand visions, those epic scenes you‚Äôve pictured in your mind, and actually translate them into ultra-realistic 8K cinematic movies without needing a degree in visual effects or a bottomless budget.

What truly resonates with me about AI CGI-VFX Studio is the emotional connection it fosters. It‚Äôs about empowerment. It‚Äôs about breaking down those old barriers and giving everyone, regardless of their skill level or prior experience, the power to become a filmmaker, an animator, a storyteller. This tool hands you the keys to unlock your imagination and share your unique voice with the world in a visually spectacular way.

# Features That Redefine Movie-Making

When I started exploring what AI CGI-VFX Studio can do, I was genuinely blown away by the features packed into this platform. It‚Äôs clear that a lot of thought went into making professional-grade movie-making accessible.

First off, the **Instant 8K Movie Production** capability is phenomenal. We're talking about generating visually stunning, high-definition 8K cinematic films in mere minutes. The quality is something you‚Äôd expect from a seasoned studio, not something you can achieve with a few clicks from your own computer. This speed and quality combination is a game-changer for anyone who wants to produce impressive content without the traditional time investment.

Then there‚Äôs the **100% Done-For-You Creation Suite**. This is where the AI truly shines. It can generate actors, develop scripts, compose music, create professional voiceovers, design eye-catching thumbnails, and so much more, all automated. For someone like me, who might have a great idea but not all the individual skills to bring every element together, this is like having an entire production team at my fingertips.

The **Hollywood-Level VFX in One Click** feature is just as impressive. Think about complex visual effects: massive explosions, futuristic cityscapes, intricate magical transformations, dynamic camera angles, and perfect lighting. AI CGI-VFX Studio lets you integrate these elements effortlessly. You can describe your vision, and the AI brings it to life, handling the technical complexities that would normally require specialized software and expertise.

One aspect I find particularly valuable for reaching a wider audience is the **Multilingual Support**. You can create your cinematic content in over 150 languages. This opens up global possibilities, allowing your stories to connect with people all over the world without needing translators or separate voice actors for each language. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to expand your reach.

Music and sound are so critical to storytelling, and the **AI Music & Cinematic Soundtracks** feature addresses this beautifully. The platform can generate high-quality, movie-style soundtracks and sound effects that perfectly complement your visuals and elevate the emotional impact of your scenes. No more searching for hours for the right royalty-free track; the AI can compose something unique for your project.

Finally, the **Cloud-Based Access** is a huge convenience. There‚Äôs no bulky software to download or install. You can access AI CGI-VFX Studio from any device, anytime, anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection. This flexibility means you can work on your projects whether you‚Äôre at home, in a coffee shop, or on the go.

# Benefits and Who Can Benefit

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about who stands to gain the most from AI CGI-VFX Studio, and honestly, the list is long and varied. It‚Äôs designed in such a way that it caters to a wide spectrum of creative needs.

**For Beginners:** If you‚Äôre just starting out, or if you‚Äôve always dreamed of making movies but felt intimidated by the technical side, this tool is for you. You genuinely don‚Äôt need any prior skills or expensive, specialized equipment. The interface is incredibly easy to use, designed to be intuitive right from the get-go. I can see this being the perfect entry point for aspiring filmmakers and animators.

**For Professionals:** Even if you‚Äôre a seasoned pro, AI CGI-VFX Studio offers significant advantages. The automation tools can save you an incredible amount of time on tasks that would typically be labor-intensive. You can maintain top-tier quality in your output while streamlining your workflow, allowing you to take on more projects or dedicate more time to the creative aspects of your work.

**For Agencies and Freelancers:** This is a massive opportunity. Imagine being able to offer your clients Hollywood-level cinematic content without the traditional overheads. You can create stunning promotional videos, ads, or short films and charge premium fees, all while keeping your production costs low. The included commercial license means you can sell your creations and keep 100% of the profits.

**For Content Creators:** In today‚Äôs digital world, standing out is key. Whether you‚Äôre on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, or other platforms, AI CGI-VFX Studio allows you to create scroll-stopping CGI videos that grab attention. You can produce engaging narratives, visually rich explainers, or eye-catching shorts that help grow your audience and boost your engagement.

# How to Profit with AI CGI-VFX Studio

One of the most exciting aspects for me is the sheer potential for monetization that AI CGI-VFX Studio unlocks. It‚Äôs not just about creating beautiful videos; it‚Äôs about building a sustainable income stream from your creativity.

* **Sell CGI Services:** With the commercial license, you can directly offer video creation services to businesses, marketers, or individuals. Think about creating promotional videos, advertisements, animated logos, or even short films for clients. You can set your own prices and, because the tool is so efficient, your profit margins can be quite attractive.
* **Monetize Social Media Content:** This is a big one. You can upload your AI-generated masterpieces to platforms like YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. As your views grow, you can earn through platform monetization (ads), brand sponsorships, and affiliate marketing. The high-quality visuals produced by AI CGI-VFX Studio are designed to go viral.
* **Affiliate Marketing:** The tool allows you to embed clickable links and calls-to-action directly into your videos. This means you can promote affiliate products or services relevant to your content and earn commissions when viewers click through and make a purchase. It‚Äôs a smart way to generate passive income from your video creations.
* **Create a Subscription Service:** Consider offering exclusive content to a paying audience. This could be a series of custom animated shorts, in-depth tutorials on using the tool for specific effects, or a library of unique CGI assets. A subscription model can provide a steady, recurring income.

# Step-by-Step: How to Use AI CGI-VFX Studio

When I first heard about AI CGI-VFX Studio, I was curious about how user-friendly it truly would be. The good news is that the process is incredibly straightforward, broken down into just a few simple steps. I found it very intuitive, even for someone who isn't a tech wizard.

1. **Step 1: Choose Your Scene & Vision.** You begin by selecting from a range of available templates, or if you're feeling adventurous, you can start completely from scratch. This is where you define your initial concept. You can describe your cinematic vision or the specific CGI concept you have in mind ‚Äì whether it's an action-packed explosion scene, a serene futuristic cityscape, or a whimsical fantasy world.
2. **Step 2: Let AI Generate Stunning CGI & VFX Automatically.** This is where the magic happens. Once you‚Äôve provided your input, you watch as the AI instantly gets to work. It creates ultra-realistic CGI visuals, complete with dynamic VFX, sophisticated camera angles, appropriate lighting, and fluid motion, all rendered in stunning 8K quality. It‚Äôs fascinating to see your ideas take shape so quickly.
3. **Step 3: Edit, Export & Monetize.** After the AI has done its initial generation, you have the power to customize. You can add AI-generated voiceovers in various languages, incorporate music and sound effects, and fine-tune other elements to match your vision perfectly. Once you‚Äôre happy with your masterpiece, you can easily export it and publish it to social media platforms, use it for client projects, or even sell it as high-ticket CGI content, thanks to the included commercial rights.

That‚Äôs really all it takes. It‚Äôs a streamlined process designed to get you from idea to finished product with minimal hassle.

# Example Case Study: My Experience as a Beta Tester

I had the fantastic opportunity to be one of the beta testers for AI CGI-VFX Studio, and I want to share a little bit about my experience because it truly solidified my belief in this tool. I decided to create a short promotional video for a fictional indie game concept I‚Äôd been mulling over ‚Äì something with a sci-fi, exploratory feel.

Honestly, I set myself a challenge: could I create something professional-looking in under two hours, starting from scratch? I logged into the platform, described my scene ‚Äì a lone spaceship gliding through a nebula towards a mysterious planet ‚Äì and selected a few keywords for the atmosphere I wanted. The AI generated an initial scene that was already quite impressive. I then used the tools to adjust camera angles, add some specific lighting effects to make the nebula pop, and found a suitably epic AI-generated soundtrack. I even added a short, AI-generated voiceover hinting at the game's story.

The entire process, from initial concept to final export, took me about an hour and forty-five minutes. When I shared the video with a few friends who are into gaming and content creation, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. They were amazed by the visual quality and couldn't believe I‚Äôd made it so quickly without any traditional animation software. This little experiment opened my eyes to the real-world possibilities and how this tool can empower creators to produce high-caliber work efficiently. It wasn't just about the speed; it was about the quality and the ease with which I could achieve it.

# Funnel and OTOs Breakdown

When you decide to get AI CGI-VFX Studio, the initial Front-End (FE) offer during the launch period is just $14.95, which is an incredible entry point. From my understanding, there are also several optional one-time offers (OTOs) that you can choose to add, which are designed to enhance your capabilities even further. Here‚Äôs a quick look at some of them, based on what I've seen:

* **CGI-VFX Studio FE + Turbo ($23.95):** This seems like a good initial upgrade to boost the core product's speed and performance.
* **CGI-VFX Studio VIP ($7.00):** At such a low price, this likely offers some exclusive perks, perhaps early access to new features or additional tools.
* **CGI-VFX Studio DFY ($97.00) & DFY Gold ($167.00):** ""Done-For-You"" packages are always a timesaver. These probably include pre-built assets, advanced templates, or entire scenes, with the Gold version offering more premium options. If you want to hit the ground running, these are worth considering.
* **CGI-VFX Studio Unlimited ($47.00) & Unlimited Gold ($67.00):** These offers likely remove any usage limits on projects or assets. If you plan on using the studio regularly or for multiple projects, the Unlimited option is almost a must-have. The Gold version might add more advanced features to that.
* **CGI-VFX Studio Reseller ($77.00):** This gives you the rights to resell AI CGI-VFX Studio and earn from it, which is a great opportunity if you're an affiliate marketer or want to offer it to your own audience.
* **CGI-VFX Studio Agency ($197.00) & Agency Gold ($297.00):** These are tailored for those who want to service clients. They likely provide tools and features to manage client projects, with the Gold version offering more comprehensive solutions to scale your agency.
* **CGI-VFX Studio Whitelabel ($297.00):** This is the ultimate upgrade for entrepreneurs, allowing you to rebrand the product as your own and sell it with full control. The earning potential here is substantial.

My advice is to look at the Front-End first, see how powerful it is, and then consider which OTOs align best with your specific goals and how you plan to use the software.

# Pros and Cons

From my perspective, and based on my experience with AI CGI-VFX Studio, here‚Äôs an honest look at what I consider its main advantages and a couple of things to keep in mind:

**Pros:**

* **Affordable Pricing:** The launch price of $14.95 for the front-end product is exceptionally low, especially when you consider it‚Äôs a one-time fee. Traditional CGI tools can cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars per year. This makes professional-grade CGI accessible to almost anyone.
* **Beginner-Friendly Interface:** I can't stress this enough. There‚Äôs virtually no learning curve. The dashboard is intuitive, and the step-by-step process is easy to follow. You don‚Äôt need to be a tech expert to start creating amazing videos right away.
* **Includes Commercial Rights:** This is a huge plus. The ability to sell the videos you create and keep 100% of the profits opens up so many income opportunities, whether you're a freelancer, an agency, or a content creator looking to monetize your work.
* **Speed and Efficiency:** The AI handles the heavy lifting, allowing you to produce high-quality 8K videos in a fraction of the time it would normally take. This efficiency is invaluable.
* **Versatility:** From creating movies and ads to social media content and more, in any niche and multiple languages, the range of applications is vast.

**Cons:**

* **Advanced Features May Require OTO Upgrades:** While the front-end product is powerful on its own, some of the most advanced features or unlimited usage capabilities are part of the optional OTOs. This is pretty standard, but it's something to be aware of if you need those specific enhancements.
* **Dependent on Internet Access:** Since AI CGI-VFX Studio is a cloud-based platform, you‚Äôll need a stable internet connection to access and use it. This is common for most modern AI tools but worth noting if you often work in areas with limited connectivity.

Overall, I believe the pros significantly outweigh the cons, especially given the low entry price and the immense creative power it puts into your hands.

# Staying Ahead of the Competition

In a world brimming with content creation tools, you might wonder what makes AI CGI-VFX Studio stand out. From what I've seen, its unique selling points give creators a distinct advantage.

Firstly, the combination of **speed, affordability, and user-friendliness** is a powerful trio. Traditional CGI and VFX software is often expensive, has a steep learning curve, and requires significant time investment for rendering. AI CGI-VFX Studio bypasses these hurdles, making high-quality production faster and more accessible than many alternatives. This means you can get your content out quicker and with less financial strain.

Secondly, the **multilingual capabilities and extensive library of prebuilt templates** offer an immediate global reach. Being able to produce content in over 150 languages without hiring translators or voice actors is a massive benefit. The templates provide a fantastic starting point, especially for those who might not have a fully fleshed-out visual idea or who need to produce content rapidly. This allows creators to tap into diverse markets and cater to varied audiences with relative ease.

The **AI-driven automation of complex tasks** like character generation, scriptwriting, and scene building also sets it apart. Many tools might offer one or two of these features, but AI CGI-VFX Studio aims to be an all-in-one solution, reducing the need to juggle multiple software subscriptions and learn different interfaces. This integrated approach streamlines the entire creative workflow.

# Refund Policy

One of the things I always look for when considering a new tool, and something that gives me peace of mind, is a solid refund policy. AI CGI-VFX Studio offers an **iron-clad 30-day money-back guarantee**.

This means you can try out the platform, explore its features, and see if it meets your expectations without any financial risk. If, for any reason, you feel it‚Äôs not the right fit for you or you don't see the results you were hoping for, you can contact their support team within those 30 days and get a full refund. They state they are on a mission to deliver a quality product with zero unhappy customers. To me, this shows confidence in their product and a commitment to user satisfaction. It makes taking that initial step to try it out much easier.

# Pricing

Let's talk about the investment because this is where AI CGI-VFX Studio truly shines in terms of accessibility. During the special launch period, you can get access to the front-end version for a **one-time payment of just $14.95**. After the launch period concludes, the price is expected to be $17, which is still incredibly reasonable.

When you compare this to the ongoing costs of traditional CGI software ‚Äì Adobe After Effects can be around $240 annually, Autodesk Maya is significantly more, and then you have costs for voice-over artists, scriptwriters, and stock assets ‚Äì the value proposition here is immense. Those tools often come with monthly or yearly subscriptions that add up quickly. AI CGI-VFX Studio offers a powerful suite of features for a single, low payment, which I find remarkable. It democratizes access to high-end video creation tools.

# Bundle Deal

During this launch, there are some exclusive bonuses that really amplify the value, especially for early adopters. The most significant one, which I think is fantastic, is that the **first 100 buyers get access to the AI CGI-VFX Studio Unlimited Reseller License (valued at $997) for FREE**. This is a huge opportunity, allowing you to sell the studio yourself and keep the profits.

Beyond this, the bundle includes a host of other valuable assets designed to help you create even better videos and monetize them more effectively. These often include things like:

* Additional VFX templates and cinematic presets.
* AI prompt generators to help you craft scenes quickly.
* Royalty-free music and sound effects libraries.
* Done-For-You thumbnail kits and SEO tools to boost visibility.
* Client contracts and video business kits if you plan to offer services.
* Hollywood-style background scenes and voice packs.
* DFY script templates for various video types.

These bonuses are designed to give you a comprehensive toolkit right out of the gate, saving you time and money you might otherwise spend sourcing these assets separately.

# Creator Spotlight: Uddhab Pramanik

Behind any great tool, there's often a visionary creator, and in the case of AI CGI-VFX Studio, that's Uddhab Pramanik. I've been aware of Uddhab's work in the tech space for some time, and he has a strong reputation as a trusted innovator. He's known for developing software solutions that genuinely empower digital creators and entrepreneurs.

His track record shows a commitment to creating tools that are not only powerful but also user-friendly and accessible. He seems to understand the challenges that creators face and focuses on providing practical solutions that can make a real difference. Knowing that AI CGI-VFX Studio comes from a developer with this kind of background adds another layer of confidence for me.

# Launch Details

If you're as excited as I am about AI CGI-VFX Studio, here are the important dates for the launch:

* **Launch Date & Time:** May 9, 2025, at 11:00 AM EST.

As long as you have an internet browser and a connection, you can access the studio and work on your projects from virtually any device, anywhere. This flexibility is a big plus for creators who are often on the move or use different systems.

# Bonuses That Amplify Value

I touched on the bundle deal earlier, but it's worth reiterating just how much extra value is packed in with the bonuses offered during the launch. These aren't just throwaway extras; they are genuinely useful assets that can significantly enhance your video creation process and business potential. Some of the key bonuses I've seen mentioned include:

These bonuses collectively represent a significant value and provide a comprehensive toolkit for any aspiring or established video creator.

1kj9in0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1kj9in0/did_they_also_use_these_phrases_with_you_that/,Did they also use these phrases with you that sounded like they were learned by heart?,"Hi everyone,

I'm interested to know if your BPD partners or ex-partners used these phrases during and after the relationship, which sounded like they were memorized.

It seemed to me as if my ex-girlfriend sometimes feigned a deliberately adult manner. Almost as if she had analyzed how mature and healthy adults express themselves in a relationship. For example, she used these meaningless phrases like ""We both made mistakes"" and ""Thanks for the good times"" after dumping me via WhatsApp after 1.5 years of being together. When I told her I was blocking her because I couldn't stand seeing her with her new boyfriend (she was with him seven days after the breakup), she accused me in a pseudo-adult manner of having no decency and of being childish to block her now after 1.5 years of being together.

Even during the relationship, it seemed as if she was trying to present her ridiculous accusations and insinuations in a kind of rational, adult context.

For example, she was unnaturally jealous about all sorts of things. After a while, I no longer reacted with understanding, but rather with stunned surprise. I was never insulting or anything like that. When it came to her not wanting me to hug my female friends when greeting them because I supposedly enjoyed feeling their breasts against me and probably touched their asses while hugging them, I said that I found it grossly exaggerated and insulting. Her reaction was then that pseudo-mature way. She said, ""I bring up problems and you don't take them seriously, and then you wonder why I'm in a bad mood."" As if these topics she regularly brought up were somehow normal things that need to be discussed in great detail in a relationship. She portrayed it as if I, as an immature guy, was too lazy and unrepentant to talk about these ""important"" topics.

Even after she did something productive for once, like tidying up, cleaning, or sorting documents, she treated me like I was the most lazy and immature person because, for example, I left a glass on the table or caused coffee stains. It was almost as if she suddenly had an unpleasant self-confidence boost. The fact that I had a daily routine to manage while she, the ""grown-up,"" lay in bed all day playing games online, of course, didn't matter. Here, too, it seemed as if she was analyzing the dynamics of other relationships and concluding for herself: ""Ah, okay, a classic argument topic is that the woman does everything around the house while the man is lazy.""

Of course, that wasn't even close to our reality, because I did 90% of all the chores, but it was still enough for a few unsettling remarks and arguments. Maybe I'm overanalyzing, but these were the things that really upset me back then because it was just so ridiculous and inappropriate when SHE accused me of being lazy and childish.",3,1746881350.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False
1kj9i5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kj9i5m/tariff_talks_begin_between_us_and_chinese/,Tariff talks begin between US and Chinese officials in Geneva as the world looks for signs of hope,"GENEVA (AP) ‚Äî The U.S. Treasury Secretary and America‚Äôs top trade negotiator began talks with high-ranking Chinese officials in Switzerland Saturday aiming to de-escalate a dispute that threatens to cut off trade between the world‚Äôs two biggest economies and damage the global economy.

China‚Äôs Xinhua News Agency says Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer have begun meetings in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng.

Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks have begun but spoke anonymously and the exact location of the talks wasn‚Äôt made public. However, a motorcade of black cars and vans was seen leaving the home of the Swiss Ambassador to the United Nations in the wealthy Swiss city, and a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the meeting, said the sides met for about two hours before departing for a previously arranged luncheon.

Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes ‚Äî tariffs ‚Äî they‚Äôve slapped on each other‚Äôs goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.

U.S. President Donald Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China¬†[to a combined 145%](https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-trade-taxes-trump-china-bessent-treasury-66668fa26957ece530a250fa8ea19faa), and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries‚Äô boycotting each other‚Äôs products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.

Even before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that ‚Äú¬†[80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-41d189bfe510e3ed7692da8647a14e64).‚Ä≥

Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.

‚ÄúThe best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,‚Äù she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. ‚ÄúIt cannot just be words.‚Äù

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as¬†[his favorite economic weapon](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-41d189bfe510e3ed7692da8647a14e64). He has, for example,¬†[imposed a 10% tax on imports](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-stock-market-china-recession-deals-e8e54a68397e6829e1d27552a1d7bfb9)¬†from almost every country in the world.

But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump‚Äôs first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.

During Trump‚Äôs first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.

Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues ‚Äî such as China‚Äôs subsidies ‚Äî were left for future negotiations.

But China didn‚Äôt come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.

The fight over China‚Äôs tech policy now resumes.

Trump is also agitated by America‚Äôs massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.

In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.

Trump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he‚Äôs reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.

The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.

‚ÄúAn increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland‚Äôs interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,‚Äù the government said last week, adding that the executive branch ‚Äúis therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.‚Äù

The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday.

The United States is Switzerland‚Äôs second-biggest trading partner after the EU ‚Äì a 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.

The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.

My parents are immigrants and grew up in very conservative muslim families. I have always been very different from others since i was little. I love art and expressing myself through my clothes, hair, style etc. My parents, as they still are quite conservative, have never really understood my style or my choices, but still supported me. Now that i live alone in an apartment with my cat, in another city from my parents, i have started getting more explorative with my sense of style. I have many tattoos (moderately tattooed) and piercings, and have adapted more of a gothic style as well as being part of the LGBTQ-community. These things are things my parents have always commented on but I have chosen to ignore it and just try to dress casually and not show my tattoos around them.
Today my parents were coming over (a 3h car drive to my city) to meet me after not seeing each other for a month. I had overslept a little but when they arrived mom and i had a good laugh over the fact. My dad said hi to me and my cat and sat down on my sofa. We all sit down to drink coffee and talk before going out to eat, like we usually did. My dad comments on my hair (info: i had recently cut it to chin lenght and dyed it a maroon color, when i usually have shoulder lenght black hair). I said that i was very happy with the result and my mom said she loved it, thought i looked better in this color than black. My dad said it was strange and dumb that i cut and dyed it myself, and said that adults go to the hair salon and not play with scissors like four year olds. He proceeded to say that my piercings looked ugly and that I looked ""freakish"" with them. I got annoyed at him, as well as my mom, he got angry and said he was entitled to his opinion. I asked ""why would you drive here just to start an argument?"". He continued to argue with me about my looks, that i look crazy with all my tattoos and piercings, that i will never succeed in life and that i'm wasted potential (I am studying psychology now and in autumn biochem but go off i guess?). I got very annoyed at him, my mom started crying and so did I. He blamed me for making my mother cry. I asked him what kind of father says their daughter looks like a freak, he got angry at me for questioning his parental abilities. I told him he had the emotional intelligence of a potato (dumb when i look back) and that no wonder his son doesn't talk to him. I told him that he is a bad excuse of a father and that he doesn't even call his children or tell him that he loves them. He never talks to my brother, who has gotten a prestigious job and worked incredibly hard, or tells him that he's proud of him. I told him that if he was going to disrespect me, he could leave. He stood up and started to walk away, my mother crying and trying to stop him. I cried because i was sad that my mom got caught in the middle of this and from all the hurtful things my dad said. He started shouting at my mom for crying and said they were going. When i say shouting, he did. I bet my entire apartment complex could hear, even my cat was concerned over the volume. I stood up and walked toward him, told him to stop screaming in my home and to shut the fuck up. He looked at me, started rushing towards me, grabbed the collar of my shirt and pushed me to the wall. I slapped him across the face and he left. My mom called him, begging him to not leave. We sat and talked and both her and my brother think I didn't do anything wrong. 
So am I the asshole for yelling back at my father? How should i proceed after this?",37,1746881014.0,AITAH,37,0.93,False

Ann Arbor, Michigan CNN¬†‚Äî¬†

Rodger Bowser has worked in kitchens in London, studied cooking in Ireland and been a private chef on houseboats in France.

But when it came time to plant his flag somewhere and build a lasting career in food, he always knew he‚Äôd return to Ann Arbor.

His decision goes back to Bowser‚Äôs formative years as an aspiring chef, when he moved here from rural Michigan for a summer job and became enchanted with the place.

‚ÄúBeing in Ann Arbor, in a college town with multiple thoughts and viewpoints and diversity, and just the way people thought about things ‚Ä¶ it really opened my eyes up to a different world that I didn‚Äôt know existed,‚Äù says Bowser, now head chef at Zingerman‚Äôs Delicatessen, a beloved Ann Arbor eatery.

Such is the pull of this unassuming Midwestern city, where students, faculty, staffers and alumni migrate back and forth from the handsome University of Michigan campus to the nearby restaurants, shops and bars of Ann Arbor‚Äôs bustling downtown. The planet around which the rest of the city orbits, the school boasts some 53,000 students and a vast menu of cultural happenings, lending Ann Arbor a casual sophistication.

A2, as it‚Äôs known to locals, consistently ranks among the¬†[nation‚Äôs top college towns](https://wallethub.com/edu/e/best-worst-college-cities-and-towns-in-america/8974).¬†Most visitors to the city have ties to the university\*\*,\*\*¬†but with a year-round calendar of events, a thriving food scene and big-time college sports, Ann Arbor offers plenty for other visitors as well.

‚ÄúFor a weekend getaway, it‚Äôs a pretty cool place to be,‚Äù Bowser says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs great entertainment ‚Äî we have folk festivals, film festivals ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got great museums and great restaurants. And if you‚Äôre into the nature part of things there‚Äôs some pretty cool stuff around town in terms of parks and stuff like that. I really like this town.‚Äù

# An ‚Äòelectric‚Äô atmosphere on game days

Most mentions of Ann Arbor start with the University of Michigan, the state school with its blue-and-maize (they don‚Äôt call it yellow) color scheme and famous sports teams, perennial powerhouses in football and basketball.

Notable¬†alumni include former President Gerald Ford, Google co-founder Larry Page, actor James Earl Jones, quarterback Tom Brady and CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, along with numerous members of Congress and foreign heads of state. One of the top public universities in the country, U of M attracts students from all 50 states and¬†[99 countries](https://umich.edu/facts-figures/), giving Ann Arbor an international flavor that complements its friendly Midwestern charm.

Its central campus sits in the heart of the city and offers many attractions, including a handful of free museums. Chief among them is the university‚Äôs¬†[art museum](https://umma.umich.edu/), whose large collection includes 19th-century landscapes, portraits by Pablo Picasso and abstract works by Helen Frankenthaler.

From there it‚Äôs a short walk to the school‚Äôs¬†[museum of natural history](https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh/), which offers kid-friendly exhibits on everything from microscopic organisms to dinosaurs, plus a planetarium hosting star shows and animations on black holes.

The U of M campus also is home to some striking 20th-century architecture, including an Art Deco bell tower and grand buildings by Albert Kahn¬†and Eero Saarinen. But its most crowd-pleasing structure may be its Gothic law school library, whose gorgeous reading room looks like something from a Harry Potter set.

Stroll through the central campus‚Äôs main pedestrian thoroughfare, called the Diag, on a warm day and you‚Äôll find hundreds of students lounging in the grass, playing music, hustling to class or passing out leaflets for events. And wow, are there a lot of events. On one recent spring day, posters around town heralded theatrical productions, jazz concerts, a comedy festival, a Zine Jamboree, a roundtable on human rights in Turkey and a Beyonc√©-themed dance party.

No happening in Ann Arbor, however, can compete with Michigan football. Each home game draws thousands of visitors who turn the town into a sprawling street festival, complete with tailgate parties and throngs of raucous, blue-clad fans. Games are held in¬†[Michigan Stadium](https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/facilities-michigan-stadium-html), nicknamed ‚Äúthe Big House,‚Äù which holds 115,000 people and is the largest stadium in the country. Almost all of Ann Arbor‚Äôs population can fit inside.

Residents rave about the town‚Äôs game-day atmosphere, which reached a crescendo two seasons ago when Michigan won the national title.

‚ÄúYou should come here on a Saturday in the fall,‚Äù says Parker Kern, a U of M sophomore who is studying aerospace engineering, echoing a common refrain. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a bunch of people in the streets and they‚Äôre all migrating towards the Big House. Everyone‚Äôs really excited. There‚Äôs music everywhere. And usually we win.‚Äù

City resident Nate Hoard often hosts several dozen friends for pre-game festivities at his house near campus. Many of them park their cars on his front lawn.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs electric. They sell T-shirts that read, ‚ÄòSaturdays in Ann Arbor,‚Äô‚Äù says Hoard, describing the scene. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if they (the football team) are good or bad. Even in the worst seasons, it‚Äôs the best day.‚Äù

# ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt have to get dressed up to go out‚Äô

Customers wait to enter Zingerman's delicatessen, a popular Ann Arbor institution for more than 40 years. The deli offers dozens of sandwiches, from classic Reubens to vegetarian options.¬†Susan Montgomery/Alamy Stock Photo

Don‚Äôt worry: Non-football fans will find plenty of other diversions here ‚Äî starting with places to eat.

Ann Arbor isn‚Äôt known as a foodie destination. But for a mid-sized city it punches above its weight, buoyed by a mix of creative student hangouts and higher-end eateries serving everything from¬†[Afro-Caribbean food](https://bluellamaclub.com/food-drink/)¬†to Korean barbecue to award-winning cocktails.

The granddaddy of the city‚Äôs culinary scene isn‚Äôt some starchy, white-tablecloth restaurant, though. It‚Äôs a deli.

[Zingerman‚Äôs](https://www.zingermansdeli.com/about-us/)¬†opened in 1982 and has grown into a regional institution, serving more than three dozen varieties of sandwiches from its handsome brick storefront in the Kerrytown neighborhood just north of downtown. Its specialty is the Reuben, but the exhaustive menu also includes barbecued brisket, Italian subs and a handful of vegetarian options ‚Äî many named for the staffers who created them.

Even Bowser, now a Zingerman‚Äôs managing partner, has a difficult time deciding what to order.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my favorite sandwich? The one in front of me,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to pick.‚Äù

Over the years the deli has expanded into a Zingerman‚Äôs empire with a bakery, a creamery, a coffee purveyor and catering business ‚Äî all in Ann Arbor ‚Äî along with a mail-order service. Their growing domain also includes¬†[Miss Kim](https://misskimannarbor.com/), a lively Korean restaurant serving such innovative small plates as lotus roots with toasted cashews in a doenjang pepper sauce. Its chef, Ji Hye Kim, is a four-time James Beard Award semifinalist.

Students also flock to¬†[Frita Batidos](https://fritabatidos.com/ann-arbor/), a Cuban-inspired, casual eatery in an airy downtown space that‚Äôs locally famous for their deliciously messy burgers, customizable with such toppings as tropical slaw, cilantro-lime salsa or a fried egg. For a savory-sweet combo, pair your burger with a batido, a Cuban fruit milkshake.

For more elevated dining, visitors can head around the corner to¬†[Peridot](https://www.peridota2.com/), a cozy spot serving creative small plates with Asian influences, along with killer cocktails. A recent menu featured kampachi sashimi with prosciutto, pomelo and herbs in a ginger vinaigrette. Sitting at the bar offers a chance to watch Elliott Reibert, a¬†[finalist](https://usbg.org/news/meet-your-2025-world-class-central-national-finalists)¬†in this year‚Äôs US Bartenders‚Äô Guild national competition, do his thing.

And if you want a nearby nightcap, consider¬†[The Last Word](https://www.instagram.com/thelastwordbar/%5C), a handsome basement bar with live music, a full kitchen and a speakeasy vibe.

Ann Arbor‚Äôs density of bars, eateries and events is one of the things that appealed to Hoard when he moved here 11 years ago.

‚ÄúI park my car Friday night when I get home and I don‚Äôt have to drive again ‚Äòtil Monday morning,‚Äù says the 43-year-old, who runs a distribution company and lives downtown. ‚ÄúI can walk to a Big Ten game ‚Ä¶ I can walk to a 5-star restaurant. Whatever I want is within walking distance. All these things add up to a great atmosphere.‚Äù

Further afield is¬†[York Food + Drink](https://www.yorka2.com/), a spacious hangout south of downtown with a deli counter, a wine store, a bar and a recent pop-up serving barbecue. York¬†has been a community gathering spot for decades; on a recent weekday afternoon a group of senior citizens shared a table, writing postcards to Congress to lobby for preserving Social Security.

Owner Tommy York drifts from table to table, chatting with customers. He greets an arriving woman by name and asks about her new hip.

‚ÄúI know everybody (in town). Not because I‚Äôm special, but because I‚Äôve been working in retail food for a long time,‚Äù says York, who bikes to work. He came to Ann Arbor for grad school in the ‚Äò80s and never left, buying the business in 2001 because he wanted a casual place where people could bring their kids.

‚ÄúOne of the things I like about the Midwest is that you don‚Äôt have to get dressed up to go out,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou come as you are.‚Äù

# School spirit and community pride

Visitors explore the Peony Gardens of Nichols Arboretum, nicknamed ""the Arb,"" a vast natural expanse with walking trails and picnic spots.¬†Scott C. Soderberg/Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum

Founded as a frontier outpost in 1824, Ann Arbor got a huge boost when the fledgling University of Michigan relocated here 13 years later from Detroit. According to legend,¬†[the village was named](https://websites.umich.edu/~aahist/chris1820.html)¬†for the wives of its two founders, both named Ann, and the area‚Äôs towering bur oaks. Ann Arbor celebrated its bicentennial¬†[with much fanfare](https://www.instagram.com/a2bicentennial/)¬†last year.

The city‚Äôs arboreal heritage lives on at the¬†[Nichols Arboretum](https://mbgna.umich.edu/nichols-arboretum)¬†‚Äî affectionately known as the ‚ÄúArb‚Äù ‚Äî a park-like expanse along the Huron River with walking paths, grassy fields and more than 100 species of trees. It also has a reputation as a romantic spot. Playwright Arthur Miller, a Michigan alum, famously recalled the Arb as ‚Äúgood for anatomical studies, especially in spring under a moon.‚Äù

Other city attractions include a¬†[botanical garden](https://mbgna.umich.edu/matthaei-botanical-gardens), the¬†[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/#event-number-901), a 106-year-old¬†[farmer‚Äôs market](https://www.a2gov.org/parks-and-recreation/parks-and-places/ann-arbor-farmers-market/)¬†each Saturday and miles of walking trails along the winding Huron River, where residents go kayaking and tubing in the summer.

Visitors also can easily spend a day browsing the streets of Ann Arbor‚Äôs compact downtown, home to eclectic shops selling everything from vinyl records to macarons. There‚Äôs also an outpost of¬†[Shinola](https://www.shinola.com/about-us.html), the Detroit maker¬†of wristwatches, leather bags and other luxury goods. Many local merchants know one another and are quick to recommend each other‚Äôs stores and restaurants.

This home-grown, community feel is an Ann Arbor trademark, says Hilary Gustafson, co-owner of¬†[Literati Bookstore](https://www.literatibookstore.com/), a downtown mainstay that hosts author readings, panels and a handful of book clubs. Gustafson and her husband Michael opened the store in 2013, filling a void left by Borders, the Ann Arbor-based bookstore chain¬†that had closed its original store here two years earlier.

‚ÄúSure, we are a retail business ‚Äî we sell books. But our role as we see it is kind of a community-building space,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúA lot of other businesses here are like-minded ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not just a collection of stores selling goods ‚Äî we‚Äôre a collection of stores that support each other and try to build community.‚Äù

Indeed, Ann Arbor hums with a distinct blend of civic spirit and school pride. People like it here, and it shows. It‚Äôs one reason why University of Michigan alums return over and over.

Asked what he enjoys most about Ann Arbor, Tommy York doesn‚Äôt hesitate.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something here for everybody,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd the people ‚Äî the people are great. I‚Äôm a small-town person in a city that has big stuff.‚Äù",15,1746880709.0,uofm,0,0.9,False

Watch out ‚Äî and make sure you don‚Äôt repeat them!

‚ùå 1. No es m√©dico, pero enfermero..

‚úÖ No es m√©dico, sino enfermero. ‚Üí He‚Äôs not a doctor, but rather a nurse.

In¬†Spanish sino is used after a negation to contrast with what was previously denied. Pero is used when there's no negation and we simply want to contrast two ideas.

‚ùå 2. Estoy aburrido porque de la pel√≠cula.

‚úÖ Estoy aburrido por la pel√≠cula. ‚Üí I‚Äôm bored because of the movie.

Porque is used before a verb clause (porque la pel√≠cula es aburrida). When the cause is a noun, like la pel√≠cula, use por. (The structure porque de is incorrect and doesn't exist in Spanish.)

‚ùå 3. Me gusta el caf√© adem√°s.

‚úÖ Adem√°s, me gusta el caf√©. / Adem√°s de eso, me gusta el caf√©. ‚Üí Besides, I like coffee.

Adem√°s cannot appear alone at the end of a sentence in Spanish. It usually goes at the beginning (Adem√°s,), or you can say Adem√°s de eso for more clarity.

‚ùå 4. Desde dos a√±os vivo aqu√≠.

‚úÖ Desde hace dos a√±os vivo aqu√≠. ‚Üí I‚Äôve been living here for two years.

In Spanish, to express how long something has been happening, use desde hace + time expression (not just desde). Desde indicates a starting point, but ‚Äúdesde hace‚Äù shows duration.

‚ùå 5. Ella es m√°s simp√°tica de su hermana.

‚úÖ Ella es m√°s simp√°tica que su hermana. ‚Üí She is nicer than her sister.

In Spanish, when making comparisons of inequality (more/less than), ""m√°s/menos... que"" is always used, not ""de"".

The preposition ""de"" is only used before numbers (m√°s de 100 personas), but when comparing people or qualities, use ‚Äúque‚Äù.

Now it‚Äôs all mass-market vibes. It‚Äôs giving ‚Äúwe scaled up, now deal with it.‚Äù The whole membership thing with different tiers lowkey feels like Apple dropping new iPhones every year, same core product, just more ways to spend.

And another thing people always hit you with the ‚Äúit‚Äôs only a dollar a day‚Äù argument, like ‚Äúyou spend more on coffee.‚Äù And yeah, that‚Äôs technically true. But that logic can be flipped on everything. I don‚Äôt wanna pay even a cent a day for the rest of my life just to own something, whether it‚Äôs a phone, a tracker, whatever. That mindset makes it feel like we‚Äôre not spending much, until you step back and realize you‚Äôre dropping hundreds, even thousands, over time. Subscriptions be sneaky like that.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong if I didn‚Äôt actually find WHOOP beneficial, I wouldn‚Äôt even be here talking about it. This is just my opinion, so don‚Äôt come for me. But with the price they charge, things could definitely be a little tighter. It‚Äôs already expensive, and when you compare what they offer to other companies, the gap isn‚Äôt always that major. In some cases (based on articles, data, or videos) I‚Äôve seen their accuracy is even a little off.

The only reason I stay loyal is ‚Äôcause they kept it screenless. That minimalism hits. Only thing I really wish it had was GPS, but I get that‚Äôd probably bulk up the sensor.

Honestly, at this point WHOOP should just give me an engineer position and let me help innovate, I got ideas!",1,1746879552.0,WhoopFitness,0,0.6,False

I was planning to return to work the very same day the termination letter arrived, which made the decision feel abrupt and unfair.

There‚Äôs something magical about sunlight streaming into your home. It energizes, heals, and lights up your space in a way that no artificial fixture ever can. But what if sunlight could do more than just brighten your interiors ‚Äî what if it could power your home, too?

At **Tanish Dzignz**, we‚Äôre passionate about creating homes that feel good and *do good*. Solar integration is no longer a futuristic concept. It‚Äôs here, and it‚Äôs reshaping the way modern Indian homes are built ‚Äî making them more *self-sufficient, sustainable,* and in sync with nature.

Let‚Äôs talk about how this works ‚Äî and why you should consider inviting the sun into your home, not just through your windows, but through your *roofline* too.

**üåû** ***Why Solar Is More Than Just an Energy Choice***

Most homeowners think of solar panels as a cost-saving device. And while it‚Äôs true ‚Äî your electricity bills could drop significantly ‚Äî the impact goes deeper.

Solar integration is:



* A way to **future-proof** your home as energy prices rise
* An active contribution toward **climate care**
* A mark of **architectural intelligence** and long-term value



But here's the catch ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just about placing panels. It's about designing your *entire home* around the sun.

**üè†** ***Designing with the Sun in Mind***

Solar architecture isn‚Äôt just technical ‚Äî it‚Äôs thoughtful. It means:



* Aligning the home‚Äôs orientation for **maximum solar exposure**
* Designing **roof slopes and angles** that catch the right amount of sunlight
* Choosing **solar-compatible materials** for better energy performance
* Creating **ventilation and shading systems** that reduce dependency on air conditioning



When done right, your home becomes its own little eco-system ‚Äî alive, adaptive, and abundant.

**üîã** ***Not Just Panels ‚Äî Think Holistic Solar Design***

Modern homes can benefit from solar tech in more ways than one. Some innovative ideas we love:



* **Solar skylights** that bring in natural light and charge battery systems
* **Photovoltaic glass** that acts as a window and an energy generator
* **Solar pergolas** that provide shade while powering garden lights
* **Battery backups** that store excess power for nighttime use



And here‚Äôs the beauty ‚Äî all of this can be *beautifully integrated* into your design. No bulky eyesores. Just clean, sleek architecture that blends function and form.

 ***Is Solar Practical for Indian Homes? Absolutely.***

In India, where we enjoy over 300 sunny days a year, solar isn‚Äôt just practical ‚Äî it‚Äôs *powerful*. Many of our clients start off hesitant, thinking it‚Äôs too technical or too expensive. But once they see the ROI and the environmental impact? They‚Äôre convinced.

Government subsidies, net metering policies, and smarter tech are making solar more accessible than ever.

**‚ú®** ***Your Home Can Be the Change***

Imagine walking into a home that‚Äôs powered by the sun. Your morning coffee brewed with solar energy. Your nights lit up with the light that touched your rooftop that morning. It‚Äôs poetic ‚Äî and possible.

At **Tanish Dzignz**, we help you build homes that aren't just beautiful on the outside, but deeply meaningful on the inside. Solar design is one more way we create spaces that *care* ‚Äî for you, your family, and the world we all share.

**üß° Ready to Welcome the Sun?**

Whether you're building a new home or considering a renovation, solar integration can be a part of your design story. Let‚Äôs craft a home that‚Äôs smart, soulful, and sunshine-ready.

Warmly, [Tanu Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanu-gupta-b5945b18b/) *Principal Designer, Tanish Dzignz*",1,1746879351.0,u_Tanishdzignz,0,1.0,False

1kj8tq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1kj8tq1/i_backed_out_of_our_trip/,I backed out of our trip.,"Warning: Medyo mahaba to. This is a rant(?).

-Do not repost in other social media-

Context: My cousins and I live in different countries. Hindi naman sila madalas nagkakasabay-sabay ng uwi so of course hindi rin naman kami madalas magkasama-sama. 

One time, one cousin invited me for a trip to another country together with my other cousins, girls trip kumbaga. I said yes ‚Äòcause who wouldn‚Äôt want to go there di ba?

Here comes my dilemma. Nagpoprovide sila ng accommodation na ibobook namin, kaso for me (and my husband) hindi sya practical, considering na we‚Äôll just sleep and take a bath sa accomm. I mentioned na during our first meeting (video call) na wala ba ibang other options kasi ‚Äúweak ang PhP‚Äù, which is technically true compare mo sa dollars. 

Most of them (3/4, kasi hindi naman kabisado nung 1 yung booking stuff just like me) push na yung option na lang na yun (it‚Äôs PhP180k for us 5) ang i-book. 

Dahil hindi talaga ako comfortable, nagmessage ako kagabi asking if we can cut down on something kasi the estimate is already way above my budget since we also have to consider our actual expenses in the country and others (plane ticket, etc). One replied, asking how much my actual budget is since they have already removed something on the trip (island trip, private dish cooking class, day trip cruise island to island, etc) and also mentioned na we will have coffee shops hunting and exploring, so the budget might be out of control. Sabi ko naman I‚Äôm good naman with coffee shop hunting, and said na what I'm considering to trim down is the cost/s of the accommodations, pointing out my reasons na we're not staying too long in the hotel/s, also so I can have more money to spend on trying out food, drinks, and maybe buying a few things that's only available in the country.. In that way, I can use extra budget for the experience itself. I also shared another option for accommodation na pasok sa budget ko (PhP69k for us 5). Binanggit ko na rin I don‚Äôt get paid for my OT kasi naka fixed lang rate ko monthly and that ‚ÄúI just got married months ago, so I'm still in the process of saving up (again). On another note, however, l'd really love to join this trip since l've wanted to go for so long..
So, that's that. I don't want to be stressed the whole time worrying about how much I'm spending, and trying to keep up with your spending since we have different incomes.‚Äù I have no intention na magpaawa, I just wanted to let them know na hindi kami pare-pareho ng financial condition. 

I was kind of hoping na they could have just considered my request kasi yun lang naman accommodation ang gusto ko i-trim down. But guess what? May isang nagreply sa ‚Äòkin saying, ‚ÄúUnderstandable that budget is a big concern, sa amin din ü•¥ But if you feel that it's going to stress you out and make the trip less enjoyable, might be worth considering going another time?‚Äù Ang una pala nilang option kapag may nagrerequest na kontra sa kanila ay wag na sumama.

So I just messaged the one who invited me, saying na ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take (cousin‚Äôs name)‚Äôs answer as a no with my request, so I‚Äôm taking myself out of the trip na lang para wala na kayong isiping iba. Honestly, I kind of felt offended with what she‚Äôd said considering na I was just being honest & asking politely, then parang di naman na rin naconsider. So yeah, enjoy kayo sa trip niyo. See you some other time, perhaps. üòÖ‚Äù and that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave the group chat so I don‚Äôy get in the way of your planning.‚Äù

Nakaka-offend lang in my part kasi I‚Äôve said my piece tapos na brush off na lang kahit na sinabi ko na gusto ko sana sumama talaga. üòÉ Tbh, wala na rin ako gana sumama sa kahit anong trip na kasama sila kasi hindi sila marunong magconsider ng ibang members at tumanggap ng suggestions. Buti na lang andyan yung asawa ko to console me. ",15,1746879122.0,OffMyChestPH,28,0.94,False
