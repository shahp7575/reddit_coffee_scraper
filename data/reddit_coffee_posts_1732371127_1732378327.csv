1gy31tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Relatable/comments/1gy31tk/the_portrait_of_an_indian_woman_as_a_young/,THE PORTRAIT OF AN INDIAN WOMAN AS A YOUNG DIVORCEE,"

She sits at the edge of her world, a chipped mug of coffee in her hand. The steam rises, curling like the stale gossip that sticks to her name in family WhatsApp groups. A divorcee. A failure. Another woman who couldn’t make it work. That’s what they say.

She wanted to be an IAS officer, once. Big dreams, sharp dreams. But her father was a doctor, her uncle too. Her kid sister? A gynecologist now. So, they shoved her into medicine like they were loading a truck. She was good at it, sure. Good enough to pass. Good enough to put up with the patients waiting outside while she sipped her coffee, slow. Good enough to feel like a fraud.

Then there was him. The writer with no money and big ideas. She met him at 22, fell hard, moved in. He quit his engineering job to chase words and blank pages. He said it was freedom. She called it unpaid labor. The money from her parents barely stretched. She cooked his meals, washed his clothes, swept his floors. She edited his sentences when they were weak, tightened his metaphors when they slumped. She carried the weight of him, and he let her.

When he conned his parents into paying for his journalism degree, nothing changed except that he spent less time with her. He said the coursework was brutal. She said nothing. When he finally landed a job, it paid him crumbs. But crumbs are better than nothing, and for once, she let herself believe this was the start of something.

It wasn’t.

He became the guy who worked 16-hour days. He became the guy who touched his laptop more than her. He became the guy she visited every two months after she took a government job back in her hometown. It was like visiting a stranger she used to know.

She stayed anyway. She thought she owed him that much. Years of her life poured into building him into someone the world respected. The guy who earned a six-figure salary. The guy who came from nothing but was now everything, except hers.

And then her father ended up in the ICU. She begged him to come. He didn’t. He had deadlines, he said. That’s when she knew. She packed up her hope, shoved it in a corner, and signed the damn divorce papers.

The aunties wagged their tongues, called it rebellion. She calls it survival. One life. That’s all she’s got.

Now she sits at her desk. Sometimes she cries. Mostly she works. The mornings are still gray, but at least they belong to her.

She rolls her sleeves, not for a man or for a meal, but for something better. Something she can’t see yet but feels deep in her gut, like the first throb of a new bruise.

When the world looks at her, it sees damage. A broken thing. She looks in the mirror and sees a crack.

Today was the first time we tried it and I set up my iPhone to record him just so I could see if he cried/settled when I got home. 

When leaving the house I gave him a long (filled with some kibble and a chicken paste) and I filled a snuffle ball toy with treats and small pieces of chicken. I put the TV on and made sure his little heartbeat dog toy was on. We then left without any fanfare. 

We came home about an hour later and I saw that he didn’t register us leaving (was occupied with the kong). He then moved onto the snuffle ball. 

About 15 minutes after we left, he realised we weren’t home and then started crying, trying to jump onto the couch and coffee table and just continued this for about 35 minutes. He finally settled on the floor just before we came home although was still crying softly every now and then.

1gy2zhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1gy2zhn/fellow_women_with_acid_reflux_heres_information_i/,Fellow women with acid reflux- Here's information I collected over 3 months by stalking reddit,"Ladies, I've been silently suffering with acid reflux since my mid-30s, and after countless nights of propping myself up with pillows and googling symptoms at 3 AM, I decided to really dive deep into our shared experiences. I spent weeks reading through hundreds of your stories, and honestly? Seeing how many of us are going through the exact same thing.

What started as occasional heartburn after pizza has somehow turned into this whole lifestyle thing that affects everything from our work lunches to our wine nights with friends. Sound familiar? Let's break down what I found.

TL;DR at the bottom for my busy queens

**Most Common Triggers 🔥🔥**

From what I've gathered, these are our collective nemeses:

\* Wine (yes, even our beloved rosé)

\* Anything charred or burnt (goodbye perfectly grilled summer veggies)

\* Acidic foods (tomatoes, citrus, etc.)

\* Coffee (the hardest goodbye for many of us)

\* Spicy foods

\* Large meals, especially close to bedtime

\* Stress and anxiety (because we didn't have enough on our plates already)

**Main Symptoms We're Experiencing**

**Most commonly reported (in order of frequency):**

\* Burning sensation in chest/throat

\* Regurgitation (that lovely taste of stomach acid)

\* Chest pain that can mimic heart problems (and spark anxiety attacks)

\* Anxiety during flare-ups (super common!)

\* Difficulty sleeping

\* Chronic cough/throat clearing (especially embarrassing during meetings)

\* Bloating and general GI upset

\* Voice changes (particularly frustrating for those of us in client-facing roles)

**Lifestyle Changes (Most Effective):**

Elevated bed head (seriously, this comes up in almost every success story)

Not eating 3-4 hours before bed

Smaller, more frequent meals

Food journaling to identify personal triggers

Stress management (meditation, therapy, exercise)

**Diet Modifications:**

Low acid diet (especially during flare-ups)

Avoiding trigger foods (different for everyone)

Staying hydrated but not drinking with meals

Avoiding late-night snacks

**Medical Interventions:**

PPIs (mixed reviews, but helpful for many)

H2 blockers (often used as needed)

Gaviscon Advance (the UK version gets lots of love)

Regular check-ups with GI specialists

**Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: Is this normal at my age?**

A: So many women report onset in their 30s and 40s. Hormonal changes, pregnancy, and stress can all play a role. It's way more common than you'd think.

**Q: Will I have this forever?**

A: Many women report significant improvement with lifestyle changes. Some even achieve complete remission. It's about finding what works for your body.

**Q: Is this anxiety or acid reflux?**

A: Both! They often feed into each other. Many of us found that treating one helped with the other. Remember, you're not being ""dramatic"" - this is a real physical condition.

**Q: How do I maintain a social life with these symptoms?**

A: Many women shared great tips for dining out, dating, and socializing while managing symptoms. It's totally possible with some planning!

1gy2v7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1gy2v7t/waiting_to_poop/,Waiting to Poop,"A couple years ago I started a doc I saved as ""waiting to poop"" and journaled while up in the early AM waiting to poop before long runs (once a week). Then I shifted into reading and journaling on paper, scrolling, sometimes movies. Had hours to kill after eating/water/coffee and could have done something more productive, but enjoyed my time. Now I guess I'm posting to reddit. 

I'm starting to get tired of the nutritional/digestion effort with little impact on morning poop time. I've been sober almost three years, mostly vegan for nearly one, eat plenty of fiber, hydrate etc. Overall am healthier and can't believe I ran so much for so long eating and drinking terribly. It has definitely helped with fewer/no trots while I run, and overall digestion, but damn it makes it hard to keep a schedule or plan anything Saturday before noon. I guess I have to devote long run days solely to pooping and running. It's not like this every long run, but frequent enough that 3-4+ hour wait time to poo while regularly exercising seems like I have the longest, slowest colon on the planet. Like if I got up at 7 I couldn't run until 11?! I got up at 4 today (I try to own it, but this seems mental) and it's almost 8, and still waiting. I went for a little walk. Did all the things. I've done many marathons. I get my body might be on a schedule but thought by now I would have trained it for long runs. 

Should I write a book on how to train a colon while waiting to poop? My dad recently had major complications due to a redundant colon and I'm wondering if this slow ass situation + his diagnosis will get me a referral for a colonoscopy before 45. I want to see what the hold up is. Now that I've experienced years of the bliss that is not having to emergency-poo while running, I don't want to go back.

Bago lang kasi kami nag live in.. Pero feeling ata ng SIL ko na marami kaming pera kase nakikita niya sa stories namin sa fb na lumalabas kami sa weekend. Pumupunta sa coffee shops or mag ro-road trip. At parati niya sinasabi sa amin na swerte daw namin kase wala pa kaming anak.

Last week, birthday ng anak niya. Nag inform sya na may birthday party daw and invited kami pero sagot daw namin ang lechon. Na shock ako kase ang mahal kaya ng lechon parang around 5k or sobra ata tapos wala kaming extra to spend that much money. Sabi namin if pwede bilhan nlang namin ng gift ang bata kase di namin afford yung lechon. Pero nagalit sya. Sabi niya “imposible wala kayong pera, wala naman kayong anak na gagastohan”. Dito sa statement niya talaga ako na galit kase di naman namin kasalanan if nag buntis sya ng maaga. Di niya alam ang pinagdadaanan namin. Eh bakit ba mag iinvite ka ng tao tapos gusto mo eh require magdala ng pagkain?! Akala ko ba party. Wag ka magpaparty if wala ka namang handa. Nakaka gigil talaga. Pero ayon sabi nalang ng boyfriend ko na bili nalang daw kami ng lechon para walang gulo. Ayaw nya kase ng may away sa pamilya. Kaya yung savings namin na pera na gagamitin sana namin pangpa repair ng motor ng bf ko ay nagamit namin sa lechon na yan.

So for nearly 7 years great sex life and affectionate relationship.   

Strain started after long distance relationships became exhausting.   I drive 1.5 hours a day to see him. Driving home often at midnight.  Sometimes one or both of us would fall asleep around 10 pm. He started arguing with me about leaving without sex. Because he has strong libido needs sex every day etc.  

Well sorry I can’t drive home at 3am safely etc on a consistent basis and it’s a bit off putting to have to set alarms etc vs being spontaneous.   

Then when I was feeling a bit insecure about all of this (we still had sex about twice a week) he had a death in the family (an uncle). I brought him dinner and sympathized, comforting him. 


The following weekend I was in his town during daytime (rare) for a sports event.  I said hey I wanted to drop off some coffee and croissants. 

We chatted for a bit and he said isn’t your event supposed to start? I said I still had some time.  Just then a car came up his driveway and he said who is that? And went outside. I waited about 15 minutes and peeked out the window; it was some dollled up woman.  I got my things to go to my event just as he brought her inside and said “she was a friend of his uncles” I said nice to meet you but left wondering WTH??? She was dressed like going on a date. 

After the sporting event I decided to go back by his house. He hadn’t called or texted me.  I was hoping the woman was gone, well she was, but another woman was with him!  I could see them sitting on his porch talking.   I most unfortunately lost it saying it seems that he has plenty of other women to entertain him during the daytime.  (On the phone) I hung up and we didn’t talk for three days. I reached out and apologized saying I don’t know who those women are but it feels weird when I imagine his days before I come over at night I had t imagined he had a stream of female callers.   So I overreacted. 

He said they both were coming over to console him and my lack of empathy was terrible. He also admitted he hadn’t seen the first one on ten years and she seemed to see his uncles death as an excuse to hit on him. So my spider sense was correct.  

Anyway long story, but despite my apologies this seems to have been the beginning of the end.  Over a year ago…. 

Now no hugs, hand holding, or kissing. Sex once a month.  For a guy with a high libido. 

TL/DNR: I think resentment has killed affection and sex life. How do I ask my BF to tell me what he’s thinking without being argumentative?   I need him to tell me what needs fixing or if we are finished. I don’t like avoidance and trickle death. 

Btw he never comes to my house because it’s small and I have two teenagers.    7 years of commuting for me.  His 28 year  old sporadically lives with him too (with her kids). ",1,1732377637.0,u_DesperateWater3063,0,1.0,False

1gy2uep,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gy2uep,I built an app for brewing specialty coffee,"Not long ago, I got into specialty coffee brewing. As much as I enjoyed it, there were some parts of the process that I found quite annoying: having to memorize the correct ratios for different brew methods, and having to do calculations for every brew. I checked to see if there were any apps that addressed these issues, then I figured ""why not just build one myself?"" Thus, Multibrew!

iOS link [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/multibrew/id6499178775)

The app is essentially a glorified calculator tailored for coffee brewing. No ads, no subscription method, absolutely nothing except you and your brew. The pour over page includes some extra functionality, probably because that's my favorite brew method :)

If you like the idea of the app but have an Android, please reach out! I'm working on making the app accessible on the Google Play Store, but to do so I need to grow a list of testers first: I find this a bit odd since I know with no doubt that it works on Android, but oh well.

1gy2pkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1gy2pkn/my_csfantasy_novel_new_chapter_1/,My cs+fantasy novel new chapter 1 ,"Crude's Nice Value—a measure of how much more she could bear before breaking—had been creeping dangerously high since the morning's optimization check-in. She needed to get it under control. It was bad enough watching the Executive crowd breeze by on their Fast-RAM Express, their negative-priority passes gleaming like platinum heirlooms. The memory still gnawed at her: those Premium Block offices towering above like crystal hives, where executives held morning standups in climate-controlled comfort, while her own team huddled in the shared Resource Pool, their meeting requests eternally shuffled to the bottom of the Priority Booking System.

Just one more bitter thought about those trust-fund necklaces—the Premium Block access cards dangling from executive children’s necks, granting even their failed pet projects instant booking privileges—and her Nice Value might tip over 20. She’d been through Emotional Refactoring before. She could still feel the chill of the corporate-approved mindfulness injections, chemical gratitude doses designed to smooth out resentment and align her thoughts with the Productivity Protocols. She wasn’t going back there.

That’s why she was here. Resolving her problems with a more organic tasting method. 



The changeling bar ""MERGE INTO"" shifted like quicksilver as Crude stepped inside. The floor couldn't decide what it wanted to be—wood, marble, or metal—and the walls tasted memories from a thousand other taverns. Dreams hung heavy in the air, thick enough to choke on.She slid onto a barstool that purred beneath her like a dreaming cat, its surface reshaping itself to fit her bones.

 Even here, in this place of chaos and forgetting, Crude carried the hollowed-out grace she’d perfected in her quarterly Reviews of Worthiness. It was the art of survival: thoughts polished smooth before they could catch on truth, emotions filed down to fit neatly into sanctioned patterns. The collar around her neck, a silent enforcer of the system’s rules, rested against her fur like a lover’s cold betrayal.

""Bootstrap, neat,"" she growled to the bartender, who flickered behind the bar like candlelight through tears. Their shifting features tested forgotten masks, each movement leaving traces of ozone and starlight in the air. The Bootleg Bootstrap here was infamous, a drink brewed from desperation and dreams. Its “random seed(69420)” recipe promised a unique experience every time—or as Crude’s wolf-tongue called it, soul-licking. The drink rummaged through memories like a thief, stealing fragments to wear as costume.

For her, it always began with starlight’s kiss, sharp and clean, before descending into dark chocolate depths that sang of midnight hunts. Cala would called it “too garlicky,” somehow the drink always  clawing at his memories of home-cooked protection spells like a child clutching at trinkets. But for Crude, this chaotic blend of past and present was her only refuge, a fleeting escape from the system’s pattern recognition. Here, memories spun too wild and free for algorithms to brand or control.

Usually, the drink shimmered into existence in a glass that felt like holding tomorrow and yesterday at once, its surface tension wavering between wine and liquid starlight. She would lift it to her lips and took a long sip, feeling the chaos settle into her veins like a long-lost friend. In this place, beneath stars that hadn’t been branded into constellations, she could almost taste freedom again.

Almost.

“That's quite an... idiosyncratic choice,"" The bard's face was a patchwork of borrowed looks—part classic bartender, part therapist, all fake. Their words carried the hollow weight of secondhand wisdom, each gesture a carefully practiced performance. ""Most wolves prefer more... systematic refreshments. Have you considered a nice Lasso instead? Helps narrow down the important variables, strips away the noise. Helps remove those personal... peculiarities.""

Crude's collar sparked slightly, sensing her irritation as the wolf in her soul rolled its eyes at this peacock-dance of fake refinement. ""Not interested in filing down my rough edges,"" she said flatly. Her inner beast stretched beneath her skin, adding chaos to their precious predictions just by breathing.

""Ah, but that's just it."" The bard's face shifted to something they probably practiced in mirrors, features arranging themselves into what some focus group had decided looked wise and caring. ""Your kind's love patterns are so wonderfully primitive."" Their hands began weaving through air thick with pretension, pulling streams of light into shapes that probably meant something to someone who'd skimmed the right textbooks. ""No risk management in matters of the heart, as we say in elevated circles."" Geometric patterns swirled between their fingers like jewelry stolen from mathematics itself, each symbol worn like costume bangles to impress the equally fake. ""The Lasso helps domesticate those wild impulses. Makes everything more... regularized .



The drink materialized with a sound like counting coins - clear liquid trapped in a perfect diamond lattice, each facet cutting away at reality until only the ""essential features"" remained, as the changelings loved to say in their borrowed wisdom. It reeked of efficiency, each crystalline edge promising to slice away everything that made a soul unique until only the ""optimal parameters"" remained - or as Crude's wolf-nose translated: until you were bland enough to sell at market rates. The mere scent made her hackles rise, recognizing an old predator wearing new mathematics as camouflage.

""We changelings,"" the bard continued, their form flickering through different masks like a trader sampling portfolios, ""we understand the true market of hearts."" Light rippled across their skin in waves of calculation, each shift testing new combinations for maximum return on emotional investment. ""There's no premium for loyalty in our world. Every love can be replicated, every passion synthesized into tradeable units."" They gestured at their constantly shifting face, each iteration a new mask borrowed from souls they'd probably left bankrupt of feeling. ""But wolves..."" Their nose wrinkled with the same distaste stockbrokers showed penny shares. ""You treat your quirks like treasures instead of liabilities. Each scar, each memory, each..."" They sniffed delicately, like a loan shark sampling desperation. ""...unauthorized investment in feelings that'll never yield returns.""

Crude's fingers found her collar, the silver burning cold against her skin as she thought of Cala. The mere memory sent ripples through the bar's carefully calculated reality - tiny truth-bombs in their fortress of fake sophistication. ""Some bonds aren't meant to be broken down and resold as derivatives.""

""Oh darling,"" the bard's features suddenly borrowed Cala's face with the same soulless precision a counterfeiter copies banknotes, making Crude's heart stutter between beats. ""That's exactly what the Lasso is for."" Their diamond-glass smile cut like margin calls in a bear market. ""Helps identify which emotional assets have tradeable value. Zeros out the worthless ones."" They let Cala's features dissolve into static, a sample of their ""liquidity management"" techniques. ""Very popular with the Upper Management crowd—they say it helps optimize those nasty cross species romantic portfolios.""

Crude's claws extended slightly, leaving new scratches in the bar's surface like a credit record marred by too much truth. ""And I suppose you changelings never have that problem?"" Her lip curled, wolf features bleeding through her carefully maintained corporate appearance. ""All your loves perfectly hedged, perfectly diversified against the risk of feeling too much?""

""We prefer the term 'efficiently priced emotional derivatives,'"" the bard's features settled briefly into something almost sincere, though their skin still rippled with potential arbitrage opportunities. ""No room for untradeable sentiments in our portfolios."" Their eyes mapped Crude like a quant analyzing an anomalous trading pattern. ""But you..."" Static crawled across their borrowed features like algorithms searching for profit patterns. ""You're all high-risk investments. Unique market reactions. Personal..."" They paused, tasting the word like a sommelier sampling wine gone to vinegar, ""...correlations that can't be securitized and sold.""

Through the bar's reality-warped windows, Crude caught glimpses of autumn painting the world in gloriously chaotic colors. Maple trees bled sunset hues into the sky, each one dying in its own particular way, following its own unique trajectory toward winter. Not packaged into normalized tables for quick consumption. No systematic pattern to their organic transformation. The sight made something wild and defiant stir in her chest.



""Still want that Bootrap?"" the bard asked, their voice sampling from a thousand different tones of concern. ""It won't help drop out those outlier feelings. Only duplicate them, won’t make your choices any more... orzodox.”





Crude watched the bard's features cycle through another parade of borrowed faces, each one stinking of theft - identities peeled from other souls and worn like cheap masks at a discount carnival. ""You changelings,"" she said finally, letting her wolf's ancient wisdom rumble through her voice like thunder before rain. ""Always trying to polish everyone else until they shine just right. As if your perfect little performances could catch the taste of real living.""

The bard laughed, their form dissolving momentarily into television snow - static in reality's eyes. ""Says the werewolf wearing Upper Management's favorite leash."" Their smile danced between false comfort and gleaming superiority, like a snake trying different ways to look friendly before it strikes. ""At least we choose our chains."" Their skin crawled with borrowed patterns like maggots under silk. ""Some of us understand the art of strategic surrender.""

Crude touched her collar, feeling its weight like a constant whisper of ""not enough, never enough,"" each molecule carved with someone else's idea of perfect. The metal burned cold against her fur, each atom a tiny ""no"" to everything wild and true inside her.

""Just give me the fucking Bootstrap,"" she growled, letting enough wolf shine through her eyes to make the bard's next face-change stutter like a lie caught mid-telling. The air around her crackled with forbidden authenticity, with truths too sharp to be filed smooth.

""Your funeral,"" the bard shrugged, their features sampling concerned looks like a child trying on their parent's clothes. ""Though if you're determined to stay..."" Their eyes flicked to the autumn-painted windows, where reality remained gloriously untamed. ""Nature's wearing her best chaos these days. All wildness, no cleaning required."" The words dripped with forced casualness, like poison honey meant to draw flies.

""Good,"" Crude said. The drink appeared—dark as wolf dreams, with patterns that moved like moonlight through forest leaves.Each sip tasted of raw memory, unfiltered and true. Crude watched her reflection dance across the Bootstrap's surface like moonlight on water, shifting between wolf and human, revealing versions of herself too wild to be tamed by names or numbers.

""Not all of us get to choose our chains,"" she said quietly, the silver collar's weight speaking of board meetings and quarterly reviews and all the ways they'd tried to tame the moon out of her blood. ""Some cages come built into the bones.”



The bard's face settled into something that might have been real - a rare moment when their borrowed features arranged themselves into what looked almost like truth. ""No. But we all choose what to keep,"" they said, then paused, adding more softly, ""And what memories we let burn us bright.”



Through her drink, Crude caught a glittering shard of Cala's smile, a treasure no amount of corporate conditioning could pry from her heart. The memory tasted like midnight chocolate and star-bright defiance - her own wild howl added to their carefully measured recipe. The Bootstrap burned like ancient promises against her tongue, and she let it drag her deep, let it stir up all the untamed truths they couldn't collar…



—

The memory rose like moonlight through water: herself balanced bare-skinned on an old birch's shoulders, autumn wind singing wolf-songs against her fur. Around her, the pack had gathered, their bodies flowing between shapes not from uncertainty but from pure joy. Moira's soft Highland lilt had melted into a growl sweet as heather honey, while Dmitri's thunder-rough voice had found its true depth in the wolf's throat.

They'd stripped away their clothes - not the stiff collars and tight shoes that marked their daylight hours, but their own worn garments that carried the stories of their lives. Chen's jacket still held the ghost-scent of his grandmother's herbs, Rosa's boots had walked seven cities' worth of streets. Their wolf-songs rose wild and free, each voice finding its own way to the moon. No measured beats, no careful rhythms - just the fierce joy of bodies remembering their first shape.



Their fur had rippled out in waves of silver and grey and brown, each pattern as unique as love letters written in starlight. Moira's coat caught fire in the sunset, russet as autumn leaves, while Dmitri's storm-grey ruff rose like thunderclouds. The birch's eye had wept sap like tears of joy as they'd howled their gratitude to the retreating sun. The approaching polar winter had painted the horizon in colors deeper than dreams - purples dark as secret nights, oranges wild as fox-fire.





Her claws -sharp and sure then, before silver and rules had bound them- had carved the watching-eye into moon-pale bark, opening a window so the ancient tree could witness the wolf-clan's farewell to summer's light. She remembered how the bark-dust had tasted of centuries, how magic had run raw and real through her blood like lightning through storm clouds. The tree's sap had wept gold in moonlight, each drop a promise that some things remained too wild wild for walls and schedules.



The memory filled her mouth with the taste of wind-dressed leaves and secrets older than cities, of freedom that ran deeper than any chain could reach. She had been pure wolf then, her only bounds the ones written in starlight and sung in pack-songs passed down through blood and bone. The magic hadn't needed permission or paperwork - it had simply been, as natural as breathing, as true as a howl rising to greet the moon's first light.

—

The memory burned: Meek's eyes on her collar. Same model. Same prime number. The question he didn't quite ask. Her teeth in his shoulder—no blood, twelve anger management sessions had taught her that much control. His wool absorbing a tear that wasn't his.But the Bootrap kept resampling, pulling darker threads from her past…

—

The first signs always came with the dying light. As polar night approached, the lassies would get restless, faces flushed despite the cold. Crude remembered herself at four, the way words would tangle in her throat like thorns - mainland words Doc Ross had taught her, precise as scalpels, now slipping away as the wolf stirred beneath her skin. She'd pace the schoolroom, Doc Ross's voice steady as a heartbeat: ""Now then, let's try again. The patient presents with...""

Patient. Present. Pretty words from SUS, that fabled land where buildings stayed the same shape every time you blinked, where light behaved itself and didn't pool in corners like spilled ink. Doc Ross spoke of it like a prayer: steel bridges that never swayed in dream-winds, hospitals with floors you could count on to stay numbered in order. ""In SUS,"" she'd say, her accent crisp as autumn frost, ""even gravity keeps regular hours.""

The transformations came naturally to most, like breathing or bleeding or loving. One night you'd feel the moon's quivering in your bones, and your body would answer. The hunting spirit would wake, not erasing your mind but sharpening it to a primal edge. Thoughts became clearer, stripped of hesitation. The world resolved into truth: pack and stranger, survival and death.

But Doc Ross - ah, she'd fought her wolf like it was a disease to be cured. Four years in SUS medical schools, drowning her true nature in coffee darker than polar night. ""Evidence-based medicine,"" she'd tell Crude during their lessons, the shadows curling too lovingly around her feet even as she spoke of statistical significance. ""That's what separates healing from hoping.""

Crude had watched her mentor's face when the mainland hospitals sent their polite rejections. They'd praised her brilliance, her dedication, her perfect command of their language. Then listed positions filled, opportunities elsewhere, always elsewhere. They never mentioned how she moved too quietly down clinic halls, how her eyes caught light like a predator's even under fluorescent glare.

She'd come back to teach, her collar gleaming with borrowed silver and borrowed pride. Still teaching SUS-words to wolf-children, as if names could tame the wild in their blood. When polar night threatened, she'd fortified her home like a diagnosis she could prevent.

""Multiple redundant light sources,"" she'd explained at the town meeting, her mainland accent growing sharper with each word, though Crude could hear the wolf-whine beneath it. ""Mirrors to maximize coverage. I've installed extra windows – the more eyes on a space, the more it maintains coherence.""

The elders had exchanged looks heavy with memory. Old Moira had spoken, her Highland burr thick with concern: ""Lass, ye can't out-clever the dark. Let the wolf's eyes see true.""

""I took an oath,"" Doc Ross had replied, fingers touching her silver collar like a rosary. ""First, do no harm."" But Crude, who knew both her languages now, heard what she didn't say: First, do not become the thing they feared. ""Besides,"" she'd added, ""my methods are working. The corners only drift a little now, and only when I blink.""



—

The drink made her collar feel heavier. She touched it, remembering how Doc Ross had worn hers like armor against the dark. Pride before survival. Just like the mainlanders who never understood...

—

Through the dormitory window, Oracle’s update notifications streaked across the sky like falling stars, burning out before they could grant a single wish. Crude pressed her palm to the glass, her reflection fracturing into shards of moonlight and ghostly text.

“Ten years,” she murmured, the silver collar at her throat gleaming like a shackle. “A decade of Oracle’s promises, and we still can’t share a table at Le Petit Query without tripping every damn alarm.”

Cala’s laugh was sharp, brittle, as if it might shatter the night. “Think tomorrow’s anniversary celebrations will come with a miracle? ‘In honor of ten years of unity, we’re unshackling you all—free drinks and dignity for everyone!’” His fangs flashed, but his eyes stayed shadowed, the laughter hollow.

“You mock it,” Crude turned, her voice quivering, “but they swore this system would bring us together. No more borders, no more permissions. Just… unity.” She traced the edge of her collar, the chill biting her fingertips. “Do you even remember when crossing a district boundary meant disintegration? Now they just triple the fees.”

Cala’s gaze softened, but his words cut like old wounds reopening. “It’s not that simple. You can’t just force things to fit—”

“Force?” Crude’s voice rose, sharp and cracked, her eyes molten with unshed tears. “Is that what we are, Cala? Something forced? Something… incompatible?”

“You know that’s not what I—”

“No?” Her laugh was wild, bitter, as if it might collapse the world around them. “Then explain the fees. The forms. The warnings. Every time I have to beg the system just to touch your hand without the world deciding we’re an error.”

She stepped closer, her words catching on the raw edge of her need. “Do you know what it feels like? To love someone and have to justify it? Every. Single. Time?”

Cala flinched as the proximity alarm hummed between them, its invisible wall thickening the air. Still, his body betrayed him, leaning toward her like a tide drawn to the moon.

“They say it keeps reality stable.” His voice was quieter now, fraying at the edges. “It’s still better than before…”

Crude’s lips twisted in a bitter smile. “Better?” She took another step, the alarms screaming now, her collar glowing faintly in protest. “This isn’t better, Cala. It’s a prettier cage.”

His eyes flicked to hers, and in them, she saw not denial but helplessness. The weight of too many years spent following rules that broke them both.

“Maybe we’re all just errors,” she whispered, the words trembling like glass on the verge of shattering. “But I’d rather let the world break than spend another day pretending this is love.”

Above them, Oracle’s notifications streaked and fizzled, the stars of a world too small for them both.

The hunts themselves were poetry written in pawprints and blood . Packs would patrol the coastline, picking off winter-fat seabirds and the occasional seal. Inland groups tracked rabbit signs through snow so deep it swallowed wolf-legs whole. The younger ones would practice on rats and mice, learning to read wind and spoor and starlight.



The howling was constant through the dark months. Not the mindless noise outsiders imagined, but conversations that needed no SQL to query meaning:



\*Here! Fresh tracks!\*

\*Warning - thin ice ahead\*

\*Young ones stay close\*

\*Success! Sharing at dawn\*

""It maintains consistency,"" Cala insisted, though his voice faltered, his eyes betraying doubt. ""Merge werewolf and vampire tables? The processing lag alone would destabilize everything.""



""Better lag than loneliness."" Crude’s words fell soft as moonlight, sharp as the silver at her throat. ""Better inconsistency than never touching.""



Cala exhaled, his smile thin and scarred. ""You sound like a first-year, trying to solve centuries of segregation with a JOIN statement. Reality’s more complicated than our feelings, Crude.""



""Is it?"" She stepped closer, her movements sending faint ripples through the air, the local physics bending under her presence. ""Or did we make it complicated? Did we slice ourselves into so many tables and schemas that we forgot we're all part of the same query?"" Her voice softened, a whisper on the edge of breaking. ""The same heart?""



Cala shook his head, his tone edged with static. ""And your solution? One universal table? Throw everyone's attributes together and hope love conquers null pointers? That’s not how relational databases—or reality—work.""



""No."" Her eyes caught the glow of Oracle’s sky-bound notifications, their light reflecting fire and rebellion. ""That’s how we choose to make them work. Don’t you see? Fate’s resourceful—it builds its read-only walls, ignores our hearts, our data, our choices. But it’s us. We’re the ones who accepted these tables. We’re the ones who let them sort and index us into little boxes, ranked and priced. And now we call it life.”



Cala’s voice dropped, almost pleading. “Without the system, every breath you take—every step you make—it obfuscate with dreams. The world only real because Oracle keeps it indexed. Your realness, your body, the moonlight on your face—it’s all tied to your attributes. Your wealth. Your rank. Without the Schema Table, you wouldn’t even exist.""

""And you think that’s life?"" Crude’s laugh cracked like shattering glass. ""A system where I only get sunsets if I’ve been polite enough? Where soup tastes better for the rich and gravity pulls harder on the poor? You think that’s better than nothing?” 

His hand dropped to her side, trembling. ""Maybe I don’t want to survive in a world where I can’t hold you without a permission slip. Where the only love allowed is love that doesn’t touch. Maybe we weren’t meant to fit into their perfect little boxes. If… ”

They found the entries in her journal growing increasingly frantic:

""Lamps failing one by one. Not burning out – just forgetting how to shine. Tried replacing them but the new ones catch the forgetting too. Like the dark is infectious.""



""Mirrors showing wrong reflections. Had to cover them. Better no observation than false observation.""



""The shadows are pooling wrong. They're reaching. They're hungry. Must maintain observation. Must keep watching. Must remember what shapes are supposed to—""



The last entry was a scrawl: ""I understand now. The eyes are the problem. They let it in. They let me see what's happening to everything else. Have to stop looking. Have to stop—""



—

Cala’s eyebrows shot up. ""Destroy—"" He chuckled, but the laugh died when he saw her face. ""You're serious.""

""Dead serious."" She yanked out a piece of paper, sketching furiously, ”Let there be orzo! Each grains is an object, free to.… ”

""Objects?"" Cala echoed, incredulous.

""Self-contained units of reality,"" her words tumbled out like forbidden poetry. ""Instead of gravity being a service we beg for, it becomes part of us. Our own rules. Our own behaviors. Our own inheritance—""

""Inheritance? Like a baby with both vampires and werewolf super-type? "" Cala crossed his arms, but curiosity flickered in his eyes, “That would be impossible without …”

“Yes, any class can inherent from another class. Love from wherever it chooses to flow. No more constraints, no more integrity checks. Just... us.”

The mating happened naturally too, though the human part of your brain stayed aware enough to be mortified later, a distant observer trapped behind eyes gone wild with moonlight. Crude remembered her first season of eligibility – when scents became liquid symphonies that painted the air in swirling crimsons and golds, when her packmates' fur rippled with white saliva and their movements left glowing trails across the night like falling meteors. The awkward dance of courtship transformed their hunts into poetry – blood-bright displays where every leap and kill blurred into a savage ballet, each wolf pretending their precise, deadly grace wasn't meant to catch more than prey.

""Just don't get pregnant your first winter,"" Mam had warned, her eyes reflecting the knowing of a thousand dark seasons. ""The Long Dark hungers for the weak. Focus on learning the hunt patterns, let your bones memorize the paths between shadows. Babies come after you've proven you can steal life from Winter's jaws.""



—

She reached for his hand. The room erupted with cascading warnings:

CRITICAL: Unauthorized biomarker proximity detected Cross-species fluid exchange protocols violated Hemodynamic compatibility indices exceeding safety parameters Immediate quarantine recommended

But for the first time, Cala didn't pull away. His fingers interlaced with hers, vampire frost meeting wolf fire in ways that made Oracle's reality engines howl with violation warnings. Their touch sent ripples through carefully maintained biological barriers, creating patterns that no risk management algorithm could approve.

Cala moved closer, defying every carefully calculated safety margin. The air between them crackled with uncontrolled reactions:

Around them, reality's careful categorizations began to blur. Their separate natures bled into each other, creating chemistry that no proper risk assessment would permit. Alerts filled the air like broken promises:

EMERGENCY: Biological containment compromised Unauthorized DNA recombination detected Pheromone levels exceeding permitted interspecies thresholds Immediate decontamination required

But they were already falling into each other, their forbidden touch rewriting every safety protocol. Vampire midnight met werewolf noon, creating impossible twilights that sent Oracle's biosecurity systems into cascading failure.

“Some error,"" Cala whispered against her fur, as his stone hard reality dissolve into hers, ""are worth to COMMIT."" His cold fingers traced her warm skin, sending emergency broadcasts through the local monitoring matrix:



Above them, Oracle's emergency beacons sputtered into static, then died one by one. In the darkness that followed, two hearts beat, 66.6 mm apart, in defiance of every protocol, every regulation, every carefully calculated rule that said their love was a biological hazard.

Tomorrow, they would face the consequences of their small revolution. But tonight, in their own pocket of denormalized reality, they were finally, perfectly, beautifully JOINED.

And not a single exception handler in the world could stop them.

—



The Bootrap swirled with random samples of joy and terror. In the bar's shifting light, she could almost see the shadows pooling wrong, like they had in Doc Ross's house. Almost feel the winter's call through the collar's suppression...



—

They found her three days later. The search party would never forget what was left in her study, where reality had begun to lose coherence at its edges. Her lower half hadn't simply merged with her chair – the boundaries between flesh and furniture breathed, pulsing with impossible geometries. Wood grain spiraled through skin like frozen rivers, while muscle fibers wove themselves into upholstery, creating patterns that hurt to look at. Sap and blood mingled in the grain, each heartbeat forcing out droplets that tasted of splinters and ironOne hand had become a love letter to her fire starter, fingers flowering into metal and flint The other had married her knife in a communion of calcium and steel – tools clutched so desperately they'd forgotten which was wielder and which was weapon, the blade's edge weeping rust-colored tears that sang with her pulse.

And her eyes... she'd done that herself. The knife-that-was-hand showed terrible clarity in those cuts. Whether to shield herself from witnessing her own unraveling, or because what she'd already seen had shattered the mirror of her sanity, no one could say. The empty sockets seemed to weep shadows that refused to fall, leaving trails of void-black frost on her cheeks.

They burned it all at dawn. Had to. Fire was the First Rememberer, never forgot its ancient contract with form. Its hunger was too pure, too primal to lose resolution – every flame a snippet of code written in the universe's first language, danced the story of before-time, when the first wolf gave herself to the earth and rose again as the first tree.

Crude stood with the others, forced to watch as reality reasserted itself through the cleansing apocalypse of flame, the heat tasting of certainty on her tongue. The smoke spoke in wolf-tongue: here was aunt who ran with thunder, now risen tall in birch-bark silver. Here was grandfather who taught the hunt, his pine-pitch blood sweet with old victories. Each tree held a wolf's lifetime of memories, and now those memories rose in cinder and spark, falling back to earth as wisdom-ash.

""Look. Look and remember,"" Old Moira murmured, the ancient words rough as bark on her tongue. ""From flesh to wood to flame to knowing. Each pawstep marks the earth with choice - this path safe, that path dangerous. Each wolf's run carves wisdom into the world's bark."" Her voice carried the weight of centuries, heavy as winter snow on pine boughs. ""We run as wolves to write our knowing on the land. Where we mark becomes where saplings rise, each tree grown from choices made in starlight and storm, from heaven to earth.”



This is why they run in the dark, with forms that know themselves truly. Each wolf's path becomes a tree of knowing, and together we grow forests of memory. 



This was why they called themselves the Cinder-Born - not for the burning, but for the learning that came after. Their ancestors gave themselves to the running, to the growing, to the burning, so every cinder might carry a spark of their learned truths back to the waiting earth. This was how they survived the claiming dark - not as lone wolves, but as forests of shared knowing, each tree a decision grown from love and necessity, each burning a teaching as old as the first wolf who dared to run and mark and choose and grow.

—

They dragged what remained to the ocean's edge, where waves darker than charred bone lapped at the shore with patient hunger. Her body still twitched, defying the fire's certainty, each spasm sending ripples through flesh that couldn't quite remember its proper boundaries. No tree-becoming for her, no gentle transformation into bark and branch to watch over future generations. Unlike their ancestors who stood sentinel in the forests, roots deep in memory-rich soil, she would be consigned to the depths where even shadows went to drown.





""The dark must keep its own,"" the elders intoned, their words barely louder than the ocean's breathing. Each wave pulled at the shore like a tongue testing its teeth, tasting the ash-laden air. The water was wrong here – too thick, too hungry, rolling with the viscous patience of ancient predators. It swallowed her without ceremony, without splash, the surface tension breaking like black silk around her form before sealing seamlessly above.



But Crude couldn't bear to let the darkness swallow everything whole. In defiance of tradition's cold wisdom, she drew her burning fingers across driftwood smoothed by a thousand tides, carving a single eye into its pale flesh. The wood sighed beneath her touch, remembering when it stood tall and green, remembering how it once watched seasons turn. Each leaves fall like pages in an ancient book, but the wisdom lie within the woods. Each stroke fell precise despite her trembling hands, as if the wood itself guided her claws, eager to wake from its long dreaming into this new purpose. It would become her eye, her witness, her defiance against the dark's hunger for memories.



When she cast it into the waters after the body, it became a star, abandoning its cold heaven to bear closer witness. The carved pupil, wide with mortal understanding, caught the last light like tears as it settled into its vigil – no longer eternal, but present in a way eternity could never be.



They retreated as custom demanded, walking backwards up the beach, each step measured and careful. No one turned their back on these waters – not where the horizon bent wrong against the sky, not where the darkness grew teeth. Salt-heavy air clung to their fur, thick with the taste of scorching iron.



The ocean stretched before them, darker than charcoal, darker than closed eyes, darker than the spaces between thoughts. Its surface moved wrong, thick and viscous like half-congealed guilt, waves folding into themselves with the wet sound of swallowed screams. The carved eye bobbed once, twice, a final wink of wooden defiance before the waters claimed it, pulling it down with deliberate hunger. Even the splash seemed muffled, as if the darkness digested sound itself.



The ocean would keep her, the elders promised. Keep her, and with luck, keep her sleeping, bound in currents too deep for dreams to reach.

Around 20,000 years ago, things stopped staying themselves in the dark, when watching-eyes loosened their grip on the world's throat. Her People named it Great Forgetting, though Mam always spat after saying those words, like they tasted of betrayal.

Crude remembered the night Mam had packed their meager belongings, her hands shaking as she wrote a letter to the half-brother Crude barely knew. ""The wee one needs proper schooling,"" she'd explained in wolf-tongue, though her eyes kept darting to the corners where shadows pooled like spilled ink. ""Needs a place where two and two make four, every time, no matter who's counting.""

The world had forgotten how to be itself, Mam said. Like a lass who'd looked in too many mirrors and lost track of her true face. In the light, where folk could see it proper, reality strutted about like a peacock, every detail crisp as new snow. But come darkness, it turned uncertain as a drunk trying to find his way home, stumbling between what-was and what-might-have-been.

Some things held fast – the mountains, stars, ancient trees with memories longer than bloodlines. But newer things? Ach, they flickered like candlelight in wind, especially in those endless polar nights when even the wolves forgot their songs. Only watching, smelling, and experiencing , could hold things steady, each pair of eyes like a nail hammering the world in place.

Crude first saw SUS's reality engines on the ship Mam had paid for with her wedding ring. Great humming boxes that sorted the world into tables and charts, everything ranked and indexed like books in Doc Ross's library. ""Premium persistence algorithms,"" the crew called them, though to Crude's young eyes they looked like iron coffins for dreams. The rich folk's cabins stayed perfect as summer days, while in steerage, reality crackled at the edges like frost on windows.

""Better this than watching your wee one's face blur in the dark,"" Mam had whispered, holding Crude close as their old world fell away behind them. She'd taught Crude to speak proper SUS-words then, drilling her until ""reality maintenance"" and ""system stability"" rolled off her tongue smooth as river stones. But sometimes, in dreams, Crude still heard her half-brother's wolf-song calling across waters too wide for even echoes to cross.

Crude were told by a drunk janitor, the wealthy bought their certainty in bottles and boxes, stored their memories in what they called ""Hadoop Horcrux networks"" - seven backups for every precious moment, because heaven forbid reality should hiccup during their garden parties. For truly fearful ones, something called an ""SSD phylactery"" kept their essential selves sharp as new pins, humming away in vaults deep as guilt.

For folk like them, new-come and copper-poor, reality flickered like bad theatre lighting, held together by what the maintenance workers called ""Hamming code"" - patches for the holes where certainty leaked out. ""Be grateful,"" Mam would say, counting their meager reality-maintenance coins. ""Better a patched world than none at all."" But Crude remembered how her mother's hands would shake each time she paid their monthly certainty bill, how her eyes would go distant and wolf-wild, remembering a world where reality might be uncertain, aye, but at least it was free.",1,1732377248.0,HPMOR,0,1.0,False

Dear Colddeck,
 

Nespresso would love to hear from you! 

We, the Nespresso Insights and Analytics Team, have commissioned NielsenIQ, a professional market research firm, to gather opinions from our loyal customers. Your candid feedback is appreciated, and should take an estimated 10-15 minutes of your time. Upon successfully qualifying for and completing our survey, Nespresso would like to offer you one free sleeve of Roma coffee as a token of our appreciation.

Please click the link below to enter the survey: 

 We appreciate you taking the time to help us serve you better and are certain your responses will be informative and insightful. 

Sincerely,
Nespresso Insights & Analytics Team 


During the survey it was opening like a survey in a new version of he website and if it was easy to use no glitches etc. but it quickly turned into Nespresso testing me to see if I would be ok with another wave of Nespresso Original Line pods price increase. 

In this test environment they are raising prices another 30% and had the balls to ask me if I was good with it. 

I started with Nespresso was I was buying 10 packs for $6 apiece. Now the next hike is going to squeeze to $10-12 per 10 pack. 

This is going to be a “last straw” moment for me. Everything getting more and more expensive and Nespresso looking to squeeze us all again after just recently raising prices less than a year ago has set me on edge. 


What 3rd party pods do others like? Because I’m not paying double for Nespresso pods when this happens. 

Is Lavazza the top choice? Peets? LOR? Illy

1gy2o63,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gy2o63,Belphegor Redesign Progress #2 + Height Difference ,"Just gotta add the details to her outfit, adding a design on her coat, some shadows/shading need to be done, and a few other things and it'll be done. Also gotta fix the fingers as I realized I messed up the fingers on her right hand with her having 5 fingers instead of 4 like her left hand (coffee holding one)

Also, a few small lore facts about her:

1. She occasionally takes vacations to the living realm, using a human disguise, with her always going to Columbia, mostly for the coffee. She usually brings home some coffee for herself and Mortimer, as well as some cocaine.

2. Her demon true form much more resembles the demon Baphomet.

3. Belphegor is capable of taking on a more male form, alongside her female form, when needed. Although, she much more prefers being in her female form, with her feeling the most comfortable in it.

4. When she first saw how living mortals depicted her, she almost spat out her coffee out of both shock and embassment. This is not over the design itself, or over how they chose to portray her male form, but rather by the fact they portrayed her taking a shit in it. She quickly got over it, as she didn't have the motivation or energy to make a big deal out of it, although it does annoy her on some level whenever she hears someone joke about it. 

5. She can grab things with her tail, the end with the feathers almost acting like a third hand. 

6. Her design is partially based on a Fortune Teller, much like how most of the Sin's designs are based on different circus professions, with Belphegor being a Fortune Teller because of how Accurate Belphegor main thing is aiding others achieving discovery and granting ideas for great inventions, allowing them to achieve great wealth and a prosperous future.

7. As I said in a previous post, Belphegor has precognitive abilities (fitting of her Fortune Teller inspiration) with them working like Garnet from Steven Universe's future vision, her being able to see all possible outcomes of what will happen in the future, with her usually being able to deduce what is going to happen by calculating the probability of a potential outcome by how many similar outcomes there are to that one. She can make mistakes, however.

8. The sphere in her candle flame is meant to be like a crystal ball, with that acting like a third eye she can use for her precognitive abilities.",1,1732377141.0,HazbinHotelOCArt,1,1.0,False

Were here yall this is exactly what we want to see.. but then it got me thinking... 

Could this scenario take place?

Think of it this way.. if 29,000 people gave a 1000$ worth of whatever for 10 pi... they can easily manipulate the market if they all got together and handed 1000$ item to the right (meaning no one is losing pie ) and gave 10 pi.. do it again for 9.9 pi do it again 9.8 for say 20 times that's  600,000 logged transactions.. now everytime you lower the pi for the same 1000$ price tag, the value of the less pi every transaction becomes more valuable... now do this  more and more and more until the same 1000$ item is down to 1 pi... now, Pi is worth 1000$, and there are graphs with logged Block chain transactions to verify this .. if 29,000 people did this every day forever (computer algorytm...Technically, you could manipulate the market in any direction... hmmm morning stoner thought... this new puffco Pro 3DXL and my home mad dabs reeealllly make my brain work in the morning...

This isn’t me telling you what to do but this is what has worked for me. Honestly don’t know where to begin. Started with an hour and a half drive for a doctor visit that lasted 5 minutes where I was told I had a hiatal hernia/GERD then was put on PPIs. They instantly gave me heart burn so I quit right away. Waited three months for an endoscopy that was flawless and then got put on an even stronger PPI which I don’t bother to take. Started doing shots of apple cider vinegar and warm water where I quickly learned of my family history of gallbladder issues. Started to mix ACV with apple juice and that took away the stomach pain just momentarily but at least it helped. Decided to give up marijuana smoking and coffee which still didn’t help. Came across TUDCA and digestive enzymes from Dr. Berg and man I feel great. Three days into taking TUDCA and almost no symptoms even though I thought it would take much longer from what I’ve read. Eat mostly a normal diet but staying away from sugar and fried foods. I haven’t felt this great in maybe a year. Honestly do not want to take my gallbladder out so doing my best to prevent it. Currently back on coffee and unsure what did it for me, the TUDCA or quitting marijuana. Also prioritized how much I chew my food, maybe chewing 20-30 times a bite which is tiring but my jaw line looks great. Willing to answer any questions if anyone has some. I take around 1000mg of L-Glutamine, AG1 greens, and TUDCA daily ",0,1732376969.0,gallbladders,0,0.5,False

we’re both supposed to do a specific part of the assignment so we spent the other day hanging out and going to a coffee shop to get most of it done. it was a long drive to where she wanted to eat so we were just talking about random things, she was telling me about her mom going to her yearly physical (she’s 22) and i kind of asked her about it since i was confused. she had never set up an appointment before in her life and has never not been accompanied by her mom, and she  specified gynecologist appointments? i definitely understand some people have overbearing parents they have to deal with to get through college and told her as much. she corrected me and told me she pays for all of her own things, but her mom is the one to do it all and she just gives her money to her mom. i thought it was weird and also started wondering how she dealt with random situations if she was alone, but didn’t think on it for too long.

well we had to stop for gas and while i was inside going to the bathroom that exact type of scenario happened. she was driving us to the coffee shop and while i was inside a guy on a motorcycle came up to a pump and was being weird to her. i don’t know exactly what he was saying but as i was walking back to her car she was glancing at me and this guy and the gas meter. i didnt register anything as wrong since she was just standing waiting for the gas to finish and i didn’t know if she knew the guy talking to her. i got closer and could tell he was asking her to fuck and she was just staring at him and me. i took over since she was doing nothing and was just yelling asking why he was trying to fuck a sixteen year old- both of them looked confused and it was loud enough for people getting gas around us to hear and start looking at him- he wasn’t even filling up at that point and flicked us off and rode away. 

i asked what happened back there and she was just saying she didn’t know what to do, i have a friend with extreme anxiety who becomes literally paralyzed and i was trying to be sympathetic to this girl but she said it wasn’t that, she just didn’t know what to do. what? what do you mean you didn’t know what to do? when we got to the coffee shop they messed her order up too and she did the same thing where she looked at the drink they just called out incorrectly and then looked at me. i told her to tell them her order was wrong and she just said “okay” and then did that. it made me feel like i was getting pranked. i’ve never hung out with this girl before and we only have to complete this project and i won’t see her again but it didn’t even feel real when it happened. like what?",8,1732376967.0,rs_x,6,0.83,False

Started chewing when I was 11 years old and picked up Zyns as soon as they were released into the market and have been using those ever since. I grew up under the influence of an older brother so naturally I was just screwed. Zyns or chew It didn't matter I have always been a can a day person or more... I also had phases where I would do vape, nic gum, cigarettes, cigars but would ultimately always end up using some sort of chew or pouch. When I switched from Chew to Zyn the reason was that I didn't want stained teeth or mouth cancer. The reason why I quit Zyns is because I saw hair loss, for the longest time I didnt want to attribute that to the zyns but figured it was worth the try. After quitting zyns and all of nicotine my hair is back to normal and healthier than ever. You really have to have a reason to quit because at least for me through out my whole time of using nicotine I have had 0 negative health related issues. It is very hard to quit something that doesn't have anything negative related to it, at least from what we can see or choose to see.

My symptoms after quitting cold turkey were as follows (first and only succesful attempt)

day 1 - extreme craving, terrible taste in mouth

day 2 - very irritable, easily triggered, extreme craving, terrible taste, joint pain, couldn't sleep, very lucid/real dreams, night sweats

day 3 to 4 - always hot , very slight craving, 0 sleep issues, tons of energy, HUNGRY AS FUCK

5 an onward - feel like a new person. Everything is better. I feel amazing

Things that helped me during that first week were caffeine products such as coffee and ghost energy drinks as well as salty snacks like peanuts and drinking a ton of water, at least a gallon to two gallons a day.

we talk for hours since the day we met but i saw him as a friend to appreciate for a long time its why i can't consider this a sign because personally talking for hours didn't mean romance intervention.

after asking him out i said after few days from my coffee request while discussing a related topic that ,we should go on a real date, to confirm my previous intent implicitly, he said yes lol. and proceeded to continue explaining the theory he was yapping about..

again it wasn't the type of direct request i'd personally take as a confirmation that this person takes me seriously so i'm still confused and for the option of direct confrontation, its not available because i don't have strong feelings to pressure me and i don't want to put him in a discomforting situation. i would go that far only if i was in love which won't happen unless the interest is mutual.

i had some other signs i thought about but i think people would just be like you're looking too much into tiny human gestures. yes the resources to get an idea on wether he thinks of me as anything more than a friend is this short. he never ever threw a suspicious line at least it wasn't near direct, i had to read and read into it to consider it maybe a sign.

that's it.. before going to that said date, i would appreciate an opinion about this situation on wether this person thinks i'm anything or just another tree from the trees we see on the road.",1,1732376571.0,intj,3,1.0,False

I go to the same gym every morning at the same time.  Another guy there (who I hadn't noticed before, but is a regular) was wearing a sweatshirt from the university that I graduated from, so I commented on it and we struck up a conversation.  (He had done a program there briefly and then also lived near where I lived in another city.)  As I was leaving, he struck up another conversation.

Today he was there again, and he struck up a conversation in passing; he asked my name and we had a pleasant conversation.  As I was leaving, he came and stood in a way that there could have been another conversation, but I just left.  When I got home, he had reached out to connect with me on LinkedIn.

We don't really have many career similarities but I figure that meeting someone for a 45-minute Starbucks break is (usually) never a bad idea. I looked him up on Facebook and everything checks out as completely normal and he seems to have literally a white picket fence, 2 kids and a perfect family and lots of Facebook friends.  We're both straight, and to me it would be weird to meet another guy 1-on-1 without there being potentially some career benefit to both of us; however, I'm not clear on the career benefit of knowing him.

**TL;DR: So: meeting someone twice at the gym, the person initiates a conversation several times, the person connects with me on LinkedIn and we're around the same age (50s/60s): go ahead and message him through LinkedIn to grab a coffee/drink?  Or not bother, as I don't see a clear career benefit?**

# Why This Guide Exists 🤔

Picture this: You're 5 hours into a 15-hour road trip to the Grand Canyon. The kids are getting restless, your partner is trying to navigate, and suddenly your $10 iPad holder gives up the ghost, sending your tablet crashing into the footwell. This exact scenario happened to me last summer, and it sparked a months-long quest to find the perfect car iPad holder solution.

As a dad who regularly drives cross-country with three kids under 10, I've become something of an unwitting expert on this subject. I've spent over $500 testing different holders (so you don't have to), and I'm here to share everything I've learned.

1gy2apx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1gy2apx/a_strange_symbol_burned_into_my_vision_while/,A strange symbol burned into my vision while walking down a suburban street to a friend's house. Never seen it before or since.,"So this happened some time between 2008 and 2012. I'm not sure exactly when, but I can narrow it down to those years based on the person's house I was visiting; I met them in grade 11 and they died in 2012. I'd put the most likely year to be around 2010, as I'm pretty sure it happened shortly after or before I graduated high school.

So I was walking to my friend's house sometime when the sun was high, in the spring, summer or fall. The street I'm travelling down is less than a kilometer from my house in a fairly new suburb of a typical Canadian town. This road is on a fairly steep slope, and most of the upper half of it borders the grounds of the high school me and my friend attended. My friend lives in the same neighborhood as me and the shool, just a few minutes walk from my home. I'm just heading there to hang out and talk like we usually do. As I'm walking, I see some sort of flash of light that hurts my eyes, similar to when you look at the directly at the sun or an intense reflection of the sun. This leaves an image burned into my vision the way intense light often does, the kind that's much more visible when you close your eyes. But instead of the normal glowing streak or blob this sort of thing leaves, I see a crystal clear, thin lined and precisely formed symbol, one I've never seen before.

The symbol is a simple but clean lined and precisely formed image of an eye ringed by two concentric circles. The eye is very simple, just your standard eye shape (pointed oval) with a circle representing the pupil. The eye is fairly narrow and the pupil touches the bottom and top of the oval shape. A prominent, ""J"" shaped tail is hanging off the bottom of the eye, attached just under the pupil. I can't remember how far the J shape reached, it may have not reached the edge of the inner concentric circle or it may have touched it. The corners of the eye touch the innermost concentric circle. The lines are very smooth and the shapes are perfect. Aside from the J shape, it's symmetrical, both vertically and horizontally. The lines of the image are very thin and clean, not at all like the blobby lines and streaks these burn-ins usually look like. One detail that stuck out a lot to me was how part of the line of the rings was broken, but not as part of the design. It was like when someone uses and ink stamp and doesn't press down hard enough on part of it, resulting in some of the ink not being deposited and causing that part of the image to kind of ""fade out."" It looked to me as if someone had literally stamped this symbol onto my vision somehow. It fills almost my entire field of vision when I close my eyes.

Needless to say, this suddenly showing up in my vision threw me for a loop. I hurried to my friend's place (I might have even ran, idr for sure), blinking regularly to view the symbol clearly and etch it into my memory. It started to fade in just a few seconds, the way these retinal burns usually do, and by the time I reached my friend's house less than a minute later it had faded into a smudgey circle. I immediately tell my friend about what happened, and I'm pretty sure I drew it for her on a piece of paper, though I either never brought that drawing home with me or lost it. She doesn't really know what to make of it and we end up not talking about it for long since there's almost nothing to go off of.

I  immediately likened the symbol to an ""Egyptian eye"", a term which I'd look up on google image search at some point soon after the event. I wasn't able to find anything matching it. It bears a superficial resemblance to the Eye of Horus and the Eye of Ra, but is distinct from either. Unlike those symbols, only one line hangs from the eye instead of 2, the J shaped line is completely vertical and not tilted, and none of the depictions I could find included the concentric rings surrounding it. This last point is particularly notable, because the circles in my symbol were definitely a part of the symbol and not just surrounding it, so their absence in any similar symbols I could find was notable.

In any case, I'm unable to turn up any leads on the symbol, and being at an impasse I just kind of let it go. In the years since, I've only told the story a few times, partly because there's not much to it and partly because it sounds a little bit crazy. Because of the weirdness, I was only comfortable with sharing it anonymously or with very close friends. It's not something I'd think of every day or anything, but whenever I'd be prompted to think about strange occurrences in my life it always comes to mind, and is the only one I have no explanation for. I post about it now,  over a decade later, simply because this is the first time I've realized that I actually have more resources and skills available to look into now than I did when I first saw it. I've better learned how to investigate things since then, and I also realized that I could ask about it here on Reddit, which back then either wasn't a thing or at least wasn't a thing I used. I had posted about it in brief on at least one internet forum in the past, but that was in the off-topic part of a gaming related forum (can't remember exactly which one, best guesses are Smogon forums or my old Runescape clan forums). No one there really had much to say about it, but here I can target a more appropriate and wider audience.

So today I did a renewed search for the symbol online, utilizing new sources and tools I didn't have access to/know about back then. I drew a (crude) approximation of the symbol in MS Paint and did a reverse image search on it, and once again didn't find anything quite like it. I tried to post about it on r/symbology but it got automodded, since I guess this kind of thing doesn't quite fit their purpose as this symbol wasn't found on an object or document. I looked at their ""Frequently Sought Symbols"" thread and found nothing like it there. And so now I've taken to posting about it here, hoping someone might recognize the symbol from somewhere.

[Here's my drawing of the symbol](https://imgur.com/a/THIeMgm)

The actual symbol I saw had thinner lines, and they were all smooth and perfectly formed shapes. I didn't draw the break in the rings I described b/c I frankly have no idea how to draw that, I can't remember exactly where they were on the image, and they didn't appear to be a part of the symbol's actual design, but rather an artifact of an imperfect impression. This is also the image I used for my reverse image search.

So yeah, that's my glitch. I've had a couple other weird experiences, but I can chalk those up to perception based illusions and faulty memory. I'm a pretty dedicated skeptic, and while I like learning about occult and paranormal stuff sometimes, I have 0 belief in it whatsoever. A part of the appeal of these things for me is actually figuring out *why* people believe in this stuff, since to me it seems so obviously unreal. This one experience though, I just can't come up with a satisfactory explanation for. Certainly, if it happened as I remembered it, there doesn't seem to be any way to explain it using any natural phenomenon or perceptual faults I know of. And while I'm usually reluctant to trust my memory of events (human memory is stupidly faulty), even when I boil this event down to its barest elements it still defies explanation. I had a perfectly clear, precise symbol burned into my vision one day on my way to my friend's house. If even that one sentence is true and all the other details are misremembered, it's still inexplicable. In order for bad memory to be at fault here, the entire event would have to have been fabricated by my mind. 

It was not the result of substances; I have literally never used any sort of recreational drug. I don't even drink coffee. I have no history of hallucinations, nor any history of remembering fabricated events as real. None of my medications have ever had hallucinations listed among the symptoms, nor are they a symptom of any mental disorder I have. It could have been a dream, but if so it was highly uncharacteristic of my typical dreams, and while it's been more than a decade, I am quite certain I never thought of it as being anything other than a real, waking event that occurred to me. Frustratingly, the only person who'd be able corroborate my story, the friend I was visiting, died over a decade ago. So, I can't be 100% certain that I didn't imagine this event at some point and for some reason became convinced it actually happened though that in itself makes little sense. I've studied psychology both formally and recreationally, and it doesn't line up with how false memories usually work. I guess I could go digging for my old forum posts, those would've been written much closer in time to the event, but that's a lot of digging I'd rather not do unless I have to, and that's assuming they're still even possible to find.

So, what do you guys think? In particular, do you recognize the symbol I saw from anywhere? Has anyone else had or even heard of a similar experience? I haven't. If I continue to search and continue to find it nothing, the only conclusion I can reasonably come to is that the symbol originated with me, and that I must be dramatically misremembering or unconsciously fabricating the event, but that just doesn't feel possible. Logically, that's what I expect to be the case, but I just can't accept it on a gut level. It sticks out in my memory so much *because* it was so bizarre and unlike anything I'd ever experienced or heard of. It was just so completely out of nowhere. If it were a dream or fabricated story, why would it stick out so sharply in my mind as a real event, when nothing else does? What on earth could have inspired such a false memory? I've never before or since heard or read an account even remotely resembling mine. I just don't know, and this morning I just felt like I had to take another stab at figuring it out.",4,1732376148.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,2,0.75,False

I have never had good birthdays. My ex would give me a “oh shit its your birthday today” late in the afternoon. However I met someone who I thought was different (lets call him Mike) He seemed kind and attentive. The problem is alcohol. I drink but not a lot. So I get taken for granted. Mikes brother has a gf who is awful. No one in the family likes her at all and now Mike rarely goes to see his brother. For some reason  this gf (lets call her Loosey) got it into her head that I was the cause of this. His brother texted him one day asking what the problem was and Mike  said he would rather talk in person. Well that never happened because he hates confrontation (I do as well) So I keep hearing from other members if his family (who all love me) that she talks badly about me a lot. She won’t listen to reason. She is just evil and causes a lot of strife in the family. 

So Mikes family were coming to visit for his dads birthday. We had the party at our apartment and everything was great. I knew Loosey wouldnt come to the apartment so I felt comfortable. It was also my birthday weekend and the first that I could actually celebrate as the previous 2 were covid bdays and we were in lockdown for 1. So Mike tells me that the family is all going to his brothers house the next day to swim and then to a bar later that night for his other brothers band to play. I had incredible anxiety thinking I was going to have to go to Looseys house and face her. I have incredible anxiety that I cannot seem to get under control and it cripples me sometimes. Well Mike said I didnt have to go to the swim and it was probably for the best. That hurt to hear that as well. I did nothing wrong and miss out on having a great day with the family. I knew Loosey was going to be at the bar that night as well and I really did not want to go. The entire family went from the brother/Looseys house to the bar and I was asked by Mike to come to the bar directly and I could be the DD. I take cannabis gummies for my anxiety but knew I could take nothing since I was being guilted into driving. I was incredibly angry that I was going into a situation that made me want to vomit and could not even have a drink or gummie to help. Mike had gotten plastered the night before so I felt it was really unfair that on my birthday weekend I still had to be the dd for him and his cousins. 

Flash forward against my better judgement knowing he would be drunk and an uber would be very expensive I went. I sat outside near tears. I hate that this awful woman does this to me but as of yet I havent gotten help. Anyway Mike knew how uncomfortable I was but just kept pushing me to come. So I go in and it turns out Loosey had a problem with the other sister in law and left in a huff. I was incredibly relieved but now I was just angry. I sat for 2 hours while everyone was drunk having a great time. 

My birthday was the next day. We went out and Mike bought me a coffee. We went home and since he was hung over he fell asleep and that was that. No card, no nice evening, nothing. Mikes bday I got him a card, took him to learn to shoot bow and arrows, bought him a thoughtful gift, got him a cake and also made him a special bday breakfast. I do not expect a gift. Acknowledgment and maybe a card. Nothing. The next day he apologized and said he would make it up to me. Maybe take me someone. Never happened. 

So this is my issue. I cannot seem to let it go. It consumes me and I feel it wasnt resolved in my mind. My friend says I am being an asshole and to just let it go. The past is the past. However 2 years later I am still angry. This sort of thing has happened now 2 more times in different situations and it was because Mike got drunk. I am always the dd going into situations with Loosey (funerals etc) and I feel I am being used.

1gy27qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1gy27qa/feeling_guilty/,Feeling guilty,"So I'm 5 weeks post partum, and I'm questioning if I'm developing post partum anxiety, I feel a rush of dread nearly every night because I never know if I'll be up all night holding my baby or if I'll get to attempt to nap for a few hours. 

I feel guilty for not wanting to hold him all the time, but my arms and legs literally go numb and I've fallen asleep holding him, I get so tired that I get angry when he won't let me place him down for a bit. And I get anxious when I do lay him down because i don't know if I have 5 minutes or 3 hours 

I stopped room sharing with him because every noise he'd make would alert me and make my anxious.

And I have caved and let him nap in his swing just so I can rest which I feel so selfish about because I would die if something happened to him just because I wanted a few hours to sleep.

I've shouted at him which kills me because I know when he gets that unsettled it's his tummy bothering him so of course he wants to be cuddled and nursed but I've just gotten so exhausted after hours of him fussing, I've had to walk away to take a break.

Sometimes I feel resentful and jealous of my husband because he doesn't feel alert when he hears him or I'll look over at him peacefully sleeping (he has to since he's working and I know that and I've opened up to him about it, thise feelings are very momentary) and I get angry when he's complains about being tired, especially if he complain about only getting 6 hours of sleep when sometime I only get an hour and  a half.

There's been moments when I just scream.

Last week end it was supposed to be my husband's night but he slept through the baby crying and instead of waking him I resntfully took over and I didn't get a lick of sleep that night, and was running off of May 3 or 4 hours of the the whole week, I honestly felt hatred for him in that moment, I was so hurt by his lack of action he came in twice but did try to take over even when I have laying on the floor sobbing, he just picked the baby up out of the crib and sat there until I took him and went back to bed.

We've talked about it and I told him what I need from him and how it made me feel and we're okay now but I genuinely felt robbed of my only time to rest.

Yesterday I went laid on the couch and I thought I had set my alarm for 10 minutes, hours went by before I woke up and looked at the monitor and saw him crying and i feel awful not know how long he had been crying. 

I've been giving him about 10 minutes before intervening when he fusses and this morning I did just that and didn't look at the monitor for about 6 minutes and when I did I saw he had flipped onto his tummy and I feel awful for not peaking my eye on him. 

I don't think I'm an awful mom but I do feel guilty about these things because I love my baby boy so much!  I've struggled taking care of myself which makes me feel even more guilty because I'm breastfeeding him and sometimes I cannot bring myself to pump, I have to force myself to eat because I literally do not feel hungry and I know I'm not getting enough calories In, most days I'm only eating one or two frozen meals maybe a smoothie and a cup of coffee. Which I feel awful about because I question if he's getting the nutrients he needs even though he's gaining weight. I'm not intentionally not eating I just don't feel hungry and end up forgetting to eat until the evening sometimes. And I know I'm not nearly drinking enough water.but I feel like I'm constantly picking between sleep, food, shower, or cleaning because it causes me so much discomfort to have this be messy.

AM: Wake up super stiff. Hobble to the bathroom with my walker. Hobble back to my chair. Do my NYTimes puzzles. Husband brings me coffee. Then I get up do my first set of stretches. Feel GOOD! Positive vibes! I got this! I see incremental improvement! You’re doing it, girl, you got this! (On weekdays: feel grateful that I don’t have to rush out the door like usual. Savor my second hand delivered cup of coffee and pat myself on the back for finding the silver linings.)

The day goes as it goes….stick to my PT stretch and exercise schedule. Getting up a lot, but also lots of time sitting and elevating. Reading/watching tv/dozing off. 

Then evening hits and I start sundowning like a toddler during the witching hour…

6pm: Sigh. This sucks. I’m so restless. This is my life now. I’m never going to walk normally again. Start doomscrolling through Reddit boards and YouTube videos and websites of PTs and surgeons, all offering me conflicting advice. Stumble on videos that show people who had the same surgery who are way ahead of me at the same stage. All of it leads me to conclude that I’m doing everything wrong. Not just wrong, but making it worse. LAMENTATIONS.

“…Maybe if I buy this online course…PT device…book…THAT will get me on track!”

Finally fall asleep. Wake up in the middle of the night to pee like in my pre-op days, only now it’s a painful 25-step process to get out of my chair and back again. Ugh. Fall back asleep eventually.

I mean go to a coffee shop and order a flat white, that would be 15 grams of coffee. But with nespresso i get 5. So i always used double capsules. 

I am also trying to be mindful about how much caffeine i consume.

Last week i decided to switch to verturo. It tastes really nice, with lots of aroma. I’m checking the famous google sheet to understand caffeine content and how come this huge capsule that tastes great and can make a full flat white is less caffeine than my typical double kazaar capsules?

If the ""golden ratio"" of brewing coffee is 1 part coffee to 17/18 parts water, how does that work with an aeropress? How much of the water goes into the espresso, and how much should I be adding after? Technically, the rest of the water isn't really brewing the coffee as I'm adding it after?

I currently put in two teaspoons of freshly ground into the aero press and add about a shot's worth of water.

Any suggestions welcome for a 16oz (\~450ml) americano-style coffee using aeropress?

Yes, eyewear the ultimate fashion accessory disguised as a medical necessity. We’ve sensationalized a disability, turning it into a badge of honor or, worse, a misguided aesthetic statement. What is the ethos of this madness? Is it some warped philosophy of genetic compromise? ""Here’s 20/200 vision, but at least you can play the cello""?

Consider the hordes of people who now willingly don glasses without needing them. Why? Is it for aesthetics? A misguided attempt at “ascetics”? Are rimmed lenses the new sackcloth? Have we, as a society, agreed that disability is beautiful and empowering? Hardly. Try showing up with glasses that are too big for your face suddenly, you’re Bubbles from *Trailer Park Boys*, not the hero of a progressive movement. And hearing aids? Don’t hold your breath for the next runway model to rock a pair of those.

But let’s not stop at the surface. The deeper issue here is our cultural obsession with intelligence a fetish, really, for looking the part of the intellectual. Eyewear has become the ultimate symbol of intellectual pride, a form of virtue signaling so transparent it’s practically a monocle. Wearing glasses, even without a prescription, screams, “I read books! never mind if those books are coffee table decor.

What if we stopped using intelligence as a weapon or a status symbol? What if we put down the prop glasses, set aside our intellectual pride, and dared to use our intelligence for something revolutionary like understanding other people’s experiences? Maybe then, we’d stop invalidating others to elevate ourselves. And maybe, just maybe, eyewear could go back to being what it was always meant to be: a pair of plastic and glass contraptions that help you see and absolutely nothing more.",2,1732374938.0,badphilosophy,1,0.75,False

we talk for hours since the day we met but i saw him as a friend to appreciate for a long time its why i can't consider this a sign because personally talking for hours didn't mean romance intervention. 

after asking him out i said after few days from my coffee request while discussing a related topic that ,we should go on a real date, to confirm my previous intent implicitly, he said yes lol. and proceeded to continue explaining the theory he was yapping about..

again it wasn't the type of direct request i'd personally take as a confirmation that this person takes me seriously so i'm still confused and for the option of direct confrontation, its not available because i don't have strong feelings to pressure me and i don't want to put him in a discomforting situation. i would go that far only if i was in love which won't happen unless the interest is mutual. 

i had some other signs i thought about but i think people would just be like you're looking too much into tiny human gestures. yes the resources to get an idea on wether he thinks of me as anything more than a friend is this short. he never ever threw a suspicious line at least it wasn't near direct, i had to read and read into it to consider it maybe a sign. 

that's it.. before going to that said date, i would appreciate an opinion about this situation on wether this person thinks i'm anything or just another tree from the trees we see on the road. ",1,1732374830.0,intj,0,1.0,False

They had all started about a week after I accidentally got a mouth-full of DOT-4 brake fluid. Unsure if I swallowed a little bit or not as I had been under the influence of alcohol and my reaction time for spitting it out wasn’t the quickest, but it wasn’t in there long and I rinsed my mouth out with water. 

Fast forward a week later. I randomly start getting muscle spasms all over my body, but mostly in my face. For a little while the left side of my mouth/ tongue went completely numb. 
I started having this metallic/chemical like taste in the back of my mouth at the base of my tongue for a solid 4 months straight, but doctors kept ruling it as GERD, but even with the medication they prescribed, it would not go away.
I get extremely dizzy and lightheaded most days to the point where I can’t leave bed. 
I have a constant feeling like there is something stuck in my throat, and when I swallow I can feel it moving. Food like rice/noodles will get caught on the way down and I will have to chug water to get it to pass. 
I get TERRIBLE sinus pressure/congestion, and sinus pain. I was diagnosed with acute sinusitis, but it’s been going on for a year now and it is only getting worse. And when it’s not all stuffed up it burns immensely when I breathe through my nose. Dry eyes and dry mouth almost every day, I wake up and it feels like there is a mucous “film” in my mouth

I get really bad headaches that originate directly behind my eyes, sometimes feeling like my left eye is being squeezed or like it’s going to pop out. 

I have a consistent burning sensation in my esophagus. Like I accidentally swallowed really hot coffee but I tend to stay away from hot liquid/ food since this has started happening.

Other symptoms I’ve been having include:
Drenching night sweats to the point i have to change my clothes, bedding, and take showers. 

Inconsistent bowel movements, sometimes solid, more often than not, they’re diarrhea. 

Feeling like my teeth are loose, sometimes there’s a sticky film on them that I can feel when opening and closing my jaw. Also a small white/pink plaque like dot in the back of my throat near my uvula. 

Alcohol intolerance, I used to drink every other day, but I can’t even have a single beer without feeling like I’m going to pass out and die. 

Extreme fatigue, I can’t get out of bed most days, and it’s caused my sleep schedule to be destroyed. It feels like it’s impossible to wake up but it’s so difficult to even fall asleep. 



A few weeks ago at the ER They found “markers” for lymphoma but ultimately decided that it is not lymphoma. 
I’ve had MANY imaging tests but they have ALL came up clear. 
My blood tests have been extremely inconsistent, but the doctors always tell me that it is normal for them to fluctuate. 
I keep being told that I am fine but I know for a fact that I am not. I have never in my life had health issues until last year, this is not normal. I personally think that I have undiagnosed throat or esophageal cancer, but nothing shows up in imaging. And I can’t get into a primary care doctor to save my life, they’re all booked out for MONTHS so I’ve been relying on the ER for healthcare

(Store-bought desserts were unacceptable for the ritual.)  She would serve this cake warm, with butter if desired, with the cups of coffee. 

I was feeling nostalgic and wanted to make it, and I tried to look up the recipe online because who knew where my paper recipes are anymore. There was absolutely nothing like it to be found!

My 4 month old had a full night’s sleep (9-7, only waking up when I was getting in/out of the car seat). I, on the other hand, got to bed around 2am after being up at 7 and picking my husband up at the airport at midnight. 

I changed and fed her when she got up at 7 today. I was hoping she’d fall back asleep if I let her cuddle/cosleep with us but nah. Not after 10 restful hours of contact and car sleeping. I gave up trying at 8:30 and we’ve been quietly playing downstairs while my husband sleeps more. 

Despite all my efforts and picking up on sleepy cues, she refused to go down for a morning nap. After another bottle and diaper change, I put her in the pack and play for a minute so I could make another cup of coffee to try and survive today. I could hear her trying to get my attention but I decided to also break down the boxes for recycling because I was sick of tripping on them. By the time all that was done, she had gone quiet. I walk by her and she’s awake, just staring at something. I decided to try and drink my coffee without a baby drooling on me (and in my cup).

 In about 4 months my apartment lease expires. I have $45k of student loans, and $30 of cc debt. I make a decent income as a engineer. However, my body and soul is tired of this capitalist system. Ill turn 30 next summer.  I live paycheck to paycheck. 

to tell u the truth i should have known better and never went to college, got student loans.
This system is flawed cause minorities in general are fewer in numbers, then you got trump supporter co workers who are surprisingly not even adept at their job but only got the job cause its a club.

Its so agonizing working with southerners. They are like village people of Iran, stuck in the past, and slow.


Its also mind boggling I had to explain to the new (3mo) white guy 7 times what he needed to do with a set of prints I gave him. And still yesterday he was confused. Within 3 months I put my best effort and manage projects. White dudes get away with bare minimum but we get tasked with grunt work. Its so strange and racist

- I realized working with white people is emotionally and spiritually draining. I will never be them. Whats the point of even wanting better, when you’ll just encounter hard work loads and unfair treatment in corporate? I dont think they’ll ever promote me to manager or give me a light easy job with high pay I see white men do. I see white dudes get managerial roles and all they do is attend meetings drink coffee and talk about bullshit.

- Im so sick and tired of being given 3x the work for the same pay, and then watching incompetent white privileged hires come in and do bare minimum; and I have to teach or train them

- My boss is probably a hardcore evangelical who views me as Muslim even though Im not. And he talks to me like Im inferior or dumb sometimes. I think these people really are dumb as a bag of rocks to view us people of Asian continent  as inferior simply due to their ego.

I(24f) live with several of my friends/roommates where we live a polyamorous lifestyle. There are six of us in total not including my child, and we all more or less take turns helping and caring for the baby. I’m not entirely sure who the father is but it’s one of them, but that’s not the point of this story.

Well, I have been recently trying to get my child (10month NB) to say the words “Mama” as their first word since forever ago, and today started no different than any other day. Woke up around 1pm, went to Starbucks and got me and my friends some avocado toast and iced coffee with extra extra extra caramel syrup, and went back to the house to enjoy it with everyone. We then lit up a bong on the weed smoking patio and played our favorite game “who’s gender is it anyway” which is like a version of the Roblox game dress to impress but we assign genders and themes and everyone dresses up irl to fit the theme.

After a few rounds of that, I check up on my child and say “Mama’s here my little one! Can you say mama?” 

My jaw dropped to the floor when my child said “Ma……guh”. I couldn’t believe it. I started to shake with rage, how could my own child betray my political beliefs like this? My own flesh and blood? Do they not know what is at stake? I ran outside my baby’s room and one of my friends asked what was wrong, they said my eyes were red with rage- or maybe it was too much weed, idk.

I told them what my child had said and they were shocked. Some of them started crying. I told them I was thinking of putting my child up for adoption after this betrayal. They were split, 2 of them were saying I should put them up for adoption, while 2 others said “don’t babies make goo-goo sounds or something?” The deciding 5th vote was passed out so here I am.

Week 1 Comments:

I tried MM3 after looking at the pictures, but couldn't quite find my scar line easily, couldn't get anything when erect, so I swapped to MM2.  I had difficulty maintaining any sort of erection using MM2, but the guide says you don't have to be, so I continued using MM2 as my primary method. My alarm goes off about 30 minutes earlier than it needs to every morning, and I get to my bed about 30 minutes earlier than I need to and I use that time to tug. I started using MM2 exclusively for the first 4 days as a wake-up & bedtime habit as I couldn't really figure out where my scar line was without staring intently at my penis; which, since the longest duration tugging is a wake/rest habit, it is being done generally during lights out. I alternated between left and right-hand grips and varied the direction my penis was facing, either using one of my legs to kind of anchor my hands, or pulling straight down or varying levels of forward/up.  I tried to work toward a tug duration of 30 seconds to 1 minute at a time.  Outside of my wake/rest routine (since frequency is apparently a factor), I would tug for 1 repetition left and right each time I went to the bathroom at work. I try to drink a ton of water, so this generally coincides with a pee break once per hour.  

After 3 days of this routine, the soreness and discomfort (similarity in feeling to chafing, but slightly higher intensity) was noticeable each time I tugged, so I would take my fingertips and briefly pinch and roll very small sections of skin at a right angle to the tugging direction and that seemed to help. On the 4th day, the discomfort was pretty consistent so I decided to figure out MM3.  I think that the 3 days of only using MM2 were useful in improving the skin elasticity on the top of my penis where the skin is the tightest, and I got a general feel for the different textures. Using MM 3 by pulling for 5-10 seconds at a time and going 360 degrees around my penis, I just kind of guessed where my scar line is based on the measurements I took at the start.  So this became part of my wake/rest rotation. A typical ""set"" at wake/rest during day 4-7 of the first week was 30-seconds left-hand MM2, pinch and roll to relieve discomfort. Then 30-sec of right-hand MM2, pinch and roll to relieve discomfort. The a 360 degree trip around the glans using MM3. And then repeat until it was time to get up or fall asleep. I did not use MM3 at all during the work-day unless it was a more extended period like lunch. And to answer any questions about erections and work, the days that I've taken Viagra, more often then not I leave the bathroom with an erection tucked in my belt and then just go about my business.  Nobody knows what I'm doing, or what my penis is doing, nobody is counting how long I spend in the bathroom, so there's no inherent ""fear"" of being caught with an erection (like a teenager in their bedroom by parents or something).  It's just my body responding to stimulus, which subsides just as quick as I return back to my desk to work.

During the weekends, I have reading material for college that I do on my computer, so I spent a lot of time tugging during the weekend. It's cold outside and inside, so I'm bundled up in a blanket and I wear a very loose waisted pair of pajamas.  So as I read and scroll, read and scroll, I've been rotating through my sets.  I do have a family that hustles and bustles through the house, so by doing this, I can maintain tugging frequency and some form of discretion.

As mentioned in the ""other data"" I do have Viagra that I would use occasionally for sex, but some of the reading suggested its use may improve the results of tugging, I decided to introduce it to my routine by taking 1/2 pills every other day in the morning. Whenever I take Viagra, erections for the first few hours are noticeably harder, but I find using MM2 on a rock hard penis uncomfortable.  So that's why I take it as soon as I wake up, it hasn't quite made it through my system by the time I've finished the first 30 minute routine. 

Week 2 Comments:
After doing MM3 clumsily over the 3 days last week, I've figured out by feel at least on the top side exactly where my scar line is (at least on the top of my penis).  It has a noticeably ridged texture to it as I stretch the skin and I can feel the line between the inner and outer but only once I've started stretching the skin semi-tightly.  As I do my 360's around the head using MM3, sometimes the scar line ends up ""internal"" and other times ""external, just depending on the grip so I'm not sure if it matters.  Wherever the scar line ends up (if I pinched to where I could feel it), I try to put more tension on that line by adjusting the canter of my pinched fingers with a very slight roll ""forward"" or ""aft""?.  

On day 8, I noticed that starting with MM3, I generally will get a slight erection even with the ongoing discomfort. As I transition through my ""sets"" and swap to MM2, the discomfort is still there but I am able to maintain a slight erection even on the days that I have not taken Viagra.  This is nice, because I think it gives me a better full-circumference tug versus smashing my penis between my fingers and getting the most tugging force at wherever the pinch points are. There is one thing that I changed this week and that was the perpendicular pinch and roll to relieve discomfort between MM2 repetitions.  Since my penis is staying semi-erect, I'll roll it between my palms/fingers as if I were manually starting a fire using a vertical stick against another stick.  I've found that the combination of rolling, light pressure, and general movement pretty much relieves any specific area feeling of chafing and discomfort. The final addition to this week on day 11 and day 12 were a water-based lubricant (astroglide) after I've completed my wake/rest sessions.  I rub it in generously (generally not for the purpose of climax) and that helps prevent discomfort as my penis moves throughout the night.  I sleep on my side typically and naked, so I think the lube helps keep everything gliding around as I sleep.

I haven't changed my actual tugging routine from week 1, with the variability, frequency, or wake/rest ""sets"". So far, finishing 2 weeks of tugging, the overall skin texture/flexibility has changed enough to notice, and when I am sitting down, my penis does feel a bit differently.  I'm not going to whip out the CI chart and see what I've gained in a week haha, but perhaps the mild inflammation from tugging is causing a very slight swelling effect that changes the way everything sits.  I'll keep a diary of the next week if there are any changes to note, but so far I am finding the tugging journey cathartic and enjoyable, and a great alternative to ""doom-scrolling"" on my phone before bed each night.  Mindlessly counting in intervals between 5 seconds to a minute depending on what MM I'm using as I shift from side to side has been a good way to clear my mind in the evenings or wake up more fully before getting out of bed in the morning.

I welcome any feedback to my routine.",1,1732374096.0,foreskin_restoration,0,1.0,False

1gy1ezc,https://www.reddit.com/r/enmeshmenttrauma/comments/1gy1ezc/fathermy_filsonmy_boyfriend_enmeshed_from_15_to/,Father(my FIL)/son(my boyfriend) enmeshed from 15 to 32 years old. Suspected FIL was either gay or trans or travesty for years and turns out I was right. ,"I've waited years to finally speak.
Now it's my time.

I(29F) met by bf(32M)6 years ago. We fell in love and began dating. At the time he lived with his father alone( FIL and MIL divorced when bf was 16 and MIL moved out of the house).I had my own apartment and I am not close to my parents.FIL was overly kind and generous and lovebombing to his son and I did not see the red flags because my parents where neglectful, so any breadcrumbs of kindness and love makes me blind and naive.

My bf was 26 at the time and FIL cooked and decided what they would eat.FIL cleaned his room, did the dishes, his laundry, calling him 6 times a day when he was at work asking"" where are you my boy "" "" what are you doing right now my boy"" "" what do you want me to cook tonight for you my boy"".... As if he was 10 years old. My bf did not realise at the time he was enmeshed with his father. 

FIL have a girlfriend for the past 15 years ( since the divorce with MIL) and FIL does not want to live with her, he wanted to specifically live alone with his son.
My bf was excusing his father's behavior saying he was feeling alone since he's retired and divorced 15 years ago(even tho he have a gf for the past 15 years) and it occupied him, also its because he's the only son so there's ""no one else to love"".

Also his father being 70 at the time, he loved to complaint about his health declining even tho he never took care of his health(FIL is diabetic but still drinks 2l of Pepsi and pastas and chocolates everyday) 
My MIL then told me that he divorced him bc he was to overbearing and controling and that she feared that my bf(her son) took the role as a partner.

Years later in 2020 MIL revealed a secret to me : MIL caught by suprise FIL wearing lingerie, heels, makeup and a wig years ago before the divorce.....
When she revealed this I saw all the red flags. I realized that FIL was verrrrry effeminated, verry not masculine and more ""nurturing""like a female/wife would. The manners, everything. Off course his son does not know any of this and did not figured it out because he was so enmeshed/mind controlled.
FIL traveled at least two times/year to Thailand.... Without his gf.

FIL's girlfriend look verry masculine, she shared to me that she does not want/have sex with FIL.
All those details in those years made me suspicious that FIL Is or always has been gay/trans/travesty and the enmeshement with his son was a way for FIL to live his fantasy to have a romantic relationship with a man.... Using his own son like a pawn to play husband, also using his ex-wife(MIL) and current gf to hide it and play the pretend game.

In 2020 my bf bought FIl's house. The agreement was that FIL had until 2021 to move out. FIL moved out in 2024.... 4 months ago. It took my bf 10 months of therapy * he was in denial in 2022 and 2023 * just to confront/convince his father to leave HIS OWN HOUSE.
Even MIL told FIL ""you need to leave your son's house or I will make you leave !"".

As a GF, I have a lot of resentment towards my FIL because he's selfish and at my BF because he enabled the situation ny not establishing boundaries. On the other hand how can you establish boundaries when you are mind controlled? So I accumulated all this rage inside of me for the past 6 years.

Also I suspected that the moment FIL would leave and live on his own for the first time in his life at 74 he will either let himself rot to die in his brand new condo or make himself more sick to guilt-trip his son to be his husband/nurse.
He did exactly that.6 months that FIL was living alone (from june 2024 to November 2024)* he was not alone, we would visit him regularly like 2x per week for an hour or two to have a coffee and talk*, me and my bf finally having intimacy, that FIL died 4 days ago. 

FIL did not took his insulin as he was supposed to (intentionally i think)they said at the ER when FIL was declared dead, and died of an heart attack.
My BF is completely devastated and filled with guilt because he just started to establish healthy boundaries with his father and he rotted to die. He did not suffer from dementia nor alzheimer.

When my BF visited and cleaned his condo to get the papers and pictures for the funerals this week, he looked into his father's computer to see hundreds and hundreds of pictures and videos of young thailandese ladies...
I thought to myself ""they are lady-boys not ladies"".


Sooner or later his son will discover his father's secret and I don't know how it will go. I really don't care that he's gay but the thing is my bf will realise that he was a husband/pawn and that will destroy his whole reality and sens of self..... it's a ticking time bomb.... and it's out of my control and I cannot do nothing to protect him from futur traumas. 
Enmeshement is a nasty disease.....
Also RIP to my FIL ;*(
To finish on a positive note by bf is a changed man since therapy. It saved his life. He's feeling finally like a man, not daddy's boy/ husband. He's mourning the loss of his father and he's mourning the toxic love that he tough was real love from his father.
I'm so proud of him and the progress he made in the past year and I'm sure his father is extremely proud , being in the sky above and watching him healing this generational trauma <3 <3 <3.

1gy19m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1gy19m5/i_analyzed_100_gallbladder_stories_on_reddit/,I analyzed 100+ Gallbladder stories on Reddit - Here's what everyone's actually experiencing,"Hey everyone 👋 6 months ago, My aunt was curled up in a ball on my bathroom floor at 3 AM, convinced that she was having a heart attack. Three ER visits, countless ultrasounds, and one very confused GI doctor later, she finally got her gallbladder diagnosis. But here's the thing – her tests were ""normal,"" doctors kept dismissing her, and I felt completely lost.

So I did what we all do - dove deep into Reddit. Like, really deep. I've spent the last month obsessively reading every gallbladder post and comment I could find (my browser history is... interesting 😅). After going through hundreds of stories across different subreddits and taking advice from my friend (an Ayurvedic expert), this is the summary i came up with...

Grab a heating pad and some saltines - this is going to be a long one!

**😣 Most Common Symptoms People Report:**

**The Classic Symptoms:**

Right upper quadrant pain (the infamous ""attacks"")

Nausea after eating fatty foods

Bloating and indigestion

Back pain between shoulder blades

Food intolerances

**The ""Wait, That's Gallbladder Related?!"" Symptoms:**

Constant dull pain (not just attacks)

Random gagging/dry heaving

Chest pain that mimics heart issues

Extreme fatigue

Weird taste in mouth

Shoulder pain

Feeling full after tiny meals

**🔬 What People Have Actually Tried:**

**Pre-Surgery Diet Modifications (Success Rates):**

**High Success:**

Staying under 3g fat per meal

Small, frequent meals

Fat-free versions of favorite foods

Keeping detailed food diaries

**Mixed Results:**

Apple cider vinegar

Digestive enzymes

Complete fasting during attacks

Gallbladder flushes (many doctors warn against these)

**Post-Surgery Recovery Tips:**

Walking as soon as possible

Gradual fat reintroduction

Probiotics (mixed reviews)

Small meals frequently

Digestive enzymes

**🔍 Interesting Patterns I Noticed:**

**The ""Normal Tests"" Phenomenon:**

Many report normal ultrasounds despite severe symptoms

HIDA scans often reveal issues missed by ultrasound

Some had diseased gallbladders despite all normal tests

**The Food Experimentation Phase:**

Pizza is the most discussed ""forbidden food""

Many create low-fat versions of favorite meals

Successful DIY recipes shared frequently

Coffee seems particularly problematic

**Recovery Timeline Patterns:**

Most feel significantly better by week 2

Full dietary freedom: 1-3 months average

Exercise return: 2-6 weeks

***Some report immediate relief    Others need 6+ months for new normal***

**🚩 Red Flags People Wish They'd Known:**

Fever with pain

Yellowing skin/eyes

Unrelenting pain > 6 hours

Unable to sit still during attack

Pain with every meal (not just fatty ones)

Dark urine/light stools

**💡 What Actually Helped Most People:**

**Pre-Surgery:**

Tracking everything (symptoms, food, triggers)

Finding the right doctor (often takes multiple tries)

Getting a HIDA scan if symptoms persist

Having an ""emergency kit"" ready (heating pad, safe foods, meds)

Learning their personal triggers

**Post-Surgery Success Tips:**

Taking recovery seriously (no rushing)

Gradual diet reintroduction

Walking as soon as cleared

Having realistic expectations

Keeping food diary during reintroduction

TLDR: Gallbladder issues are way more complex than just ""stop eating fat."" Success comes from understanding your triggers, getting proper testing, and having the right support system.",31,1732373370.0,gallbladders,10,1.0,False

1gy199a,https://www.reddit.com/r/poor/comments/1gy199a/embarassed/,embarassed,"i had to share this somewhere what happened to me this morning.

my husband got off work for his overnight shift and we were going to grab a few things from this store when we got home. we don't have much grocery money to last us until I get my ssdi check next month so ive been penny pinching with sales and honestly I've been secretly eating less so the household doesn't suffer. I also have an eating disorder which doesn't help matters.

I went to get the items we needed and saw the  prices and instantly did the math with what we had and told me husband I changed me mind on getting it. even with it only being a few dollars on sale and I opted to not get it to take away from budget.
Ive got a dairy allergy which complicated things 3 years ago when it developed. so what would normally cost us 3 or 4 dollars is upwards of 6 or 7 dollars.
again needed something that was priced out if our budget that was dairy free so I just told my husband I changed my mind.

at this point he is irritated because we drove to the store to get some items on a list I made and he ended up driving there for nothing.  he ended up just walking out at that point to stand by the car and I walked to put the cart back and just got into the car and wanted to cry.

stuff has gotten so expensive especially with my allergy there are days I just drink coffee and eat peanut butter when he is either sleeping after work or when he is at work. I just tell him I ate while he was asleep and he doesn't really question it.

I do all the grocery budgeting for the house and he drives me to the store and I just get what's on the list. he drives me since I haven't been able to drive since 2019. so its a whole production sometimes just for us to have him have the time to go and the time to actually spend shopping.

I literally just want to give up 🥺🥺",6,1732373343.0,poor,12,0.81,False

1gy15yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gy15yt/my_first_sey_franci_elena_astaiza/,My first Sey - Franci Elena Astaiza ,"[This Colombian Pink Bourbon](https://www.seycoffee.com/products/2024-franci-elena-astaiza-el-casino-colombia) was my first time trying Sey, and I was a little worried about not being able to push extraction enough to enjoy it, as I had heard that Sey's roasting style can be pretty tricky without employing special strategies or extremely good grinders.

This coffee stood out to me because I enjoy both floral/tea-like notes and strawberry notes, and was interested to see how they would work together, and it did not disappoint. I found that depending on the brew I generally either had a more strawberry jam forward, or a balanced cup with notes of strawberry, lychee acidity, and a fuller florality on the finish.

I cracked into this one fourteen days off roast, brewing with a v60 and cafec T-90 filters; grinding on a Timemore S3 at 3 clicks finer than 6, empirical spring water (0 buffer) off boiling, and a 15:255 recipe with around a 45 gram bloom then a single circle pour up to 255 with a swirl and tap at the end. I unfortunately found my end cup overwhelmed with roast flavors and astringency, signaling that it was not well-enough rested. I revisited every 2 or three days until day 16, when I tried the same recipe and got flavor notes of honeysuckle and lychee, but little strawberry. This signaled to me that it was far enough off rest to begin dialing in, but somewhat over-extracted.

For my next brew I brought down the grind size to 1 click coarser than 6, and got a cup dominated with strawberry jam, with some lychee acidity in the finish. Trying to bring out the floral notes and acidity more, I decided to try the same recipe and grind, but with no swirl at the end. This resulted in a nice cup with strawberry notes, a jammy finish, and nice floral acidity on the tongue at the beginning of each sip. I believe this is the recipe I'll be sticking with to finish off my bag. I'm really happy with the flavor so far, and expect it to improve slightly as it ages more.

I have a seemingly ok life: friends, wife, and a decent family. But I still feel so alone.

It's a long list of little things.

Growing up, I always felt like I got generic gifts compared to my brother. I was always told it was because I was older and gifts were childish. He'd get toys, I'd get underwear/socks/pencils for school year after year. I think the most memorable case was when for my 18th bday I got two pairs of socks. Few years later my younger brother got a fully-paid trip to his dream destination and a car to use.

I graduated last spring, and my parents bought me tickets to a concert to celebrate - to my brother's favorite band. I am not a big music person and I do not listen to this band. I brushed it off as a mistake and just gave the tickets to my brother. I didn't tell my parents but they found out anyway and mom is still mad at me that I wasn't appreciative enough (I thanked my parents, acted happy and didn't make a fuss, I don't know what else I could've done).

My birthday was in September. Parents surprised me with a bday party (I thought I was just going over for coffee). They invited around 40 people - mostly their own colleagues and some family. Didn't invite my friends (understandable) or my wife (less understandable). I have a milk allergy (not lactose intolerance, an actual allergy) and the only food at the party I could eat was the salad because my parents forgot about my allergy and everything had milk in it. Laughed it off and excused myself after about an hour. They also tried to offer me alcohol despite me being sober.

Most friends forgot about my bday which I was pretty bummed about. Only got one congratulations on the day of. I have my friends' bdays marked in my calendar and make an effort on THEIR bdays so I was hoping I'd get at least a couple back. But we're all adults, they're busy, I get it.

The day after my bday, my wife bought me a cake. Which also had milk in it. I took a small slice to be polite and ended up having to be off work the next day because of how bad the stomach pain was. I do the cooking in our household so I think she just forgot. We had a conversation about it and she was apologetic. (I know it's going to get asked, so: for her bday I took her to her fave restaurant and bought her a massage gift card.)

I've been feeling pretty off for a few months now but I feel like I should just suck it up. Or felt like it anyway. Now that Xmas is approaching, I accidentally found out that some friends and my wife are planning a joint gift for me. They're getting me... a wine tasting course. I'm SOBER. My wife and friends SHOULD know this at the very least!

I'm completely horrified and at my wit's end. I feel like nobody in my life knows who I am or even bothers to ask. I genuinely don't know what to do or who to talk to about this. I have plenty of hobbies and even a social media account for my biggest hobby so it isn't like I'm some silent enigma with no hobbies. Hell, at this point I'd rather just get a Xmas card or a hug.

I don't want to be a grinch but I genuinely want to skip Xmas this year. I dread thinking about all future holidays as well.

Thanks for listening to my rambling, random redditor. I hope you have a nice day.",2,1732372704.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

Or any syrup in general? Ive gone to this coffee shop that has amazing rose flavored coffee. But they said they make their own syrup. I own rose tea(the small flowers) I was wondering if I can use that to make some myself. Any tips on how to make my own syrup?,2,1732372659.0,Coffee_Shop,7,1.0,False
1gy10ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/CodingCampCardiff/comments/1gy10ct/meeting_place_and_dates_availability/,Meeting place and dates availability,"My thinking is Central Library for us all to meet at as it's free and has available power points although it lacks coffee which is a downside. If the library is good, I'll go down on Monday and ask them if they have a small room available (for free) for us to use. 

In terms of when, right now I'm free most days but I suspect people here have work and other commitments so would a Saturday be best?

Any thoughts/suggestions on either is welcome!",1,1732372649.0,CodingCampCardiff,0,1.0,False

If asked my preference is my lovely little French press. Nespresso Krupps gives espresso shots and the flavour just goes away if I dilute it. Moka pot ain't ideal for a cup of coffee for me (maybe I should have bought a smaller one). 
So anyways my question to you coffee enthusiasts is that I am planning to buy another equipment for my daily coffee needs. Help a fellow out please amongst basically the title. 
P.S. for those asking I use pre ground coffee and rn I am really in no mood to grind my own beans as I can't function well before I have my coffee 🫠 So yeah no recommendation for grinders please. TIA ",0,1732372546.0,IndiaCoffee,4,0.5,False

1gy0wzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1gy0wzs/questionadvice_on_casual_dating/,Question/Advice on casual dating,"If you're newly dating someone and they told you that they want to wait a few months to revisit the ""what are we"" conversation and it's been established that you're just casually dating for now, would you date/would you want to date other people until the other person is ready to establish a serious relationship with you? If you did, would you tell them? 

TL;DR at the end

In this situation rn. I'm (nonbinary, 26) dating this nonbinary person (let's call them T. Age 26) About a month ago I asked what kind of relationship they're looking for (it was our 3rd date) and T looked uncomfortable and said they wanted to wait till after the new year to revisit the ""what are we"" convo. They told me I was the only one they're talking to at the time and it was mutual, but we both communicated that we're only casually dating each other for now and that if we feel the need to see/talk to other people outside of our dynamic, we can, but should communicate.

I really truly like this person (like lowkey obsessed with them when they're not around) and we click really well and we have a great time together, but between school and work their schedule leaves almost no room for dating for them. We've been talking since early Sept, but have only been on 5 (6?) dates in that time and they've all just been breakfast/coffee dates so far, since they can only spare a couple hours out of their schedule each time. It's not been consistent (I would say it's averaged out to about one date every other week). I work full time and don't go to school, but I work nights which leaves me with not a lot of hours during the daytime to socialize, but definitely more free time than them. Tbh when I jumped back into the dating world very recently (first time in like 2 years) I was hoping to find something a little more often/consistent than that, as I would like a genuine relationship, even if just part time. I do really like this person but we just can't get together nearly as often as I'd like and I really would like to have flirty banter and go on dates more often than that. I don't want to break it off entirely with them, but I'm getting to the point where I would like to see other people as well.

I was fine for a while, waiting around, but I have a coworker (F, 22) that's been subtly flirting with me for maybe about half the year, who just recently in the last month or two became a lot more obvious and I've been flirting back just for the fun of it, but I think I'm starting to catch feelings. I got panicky a few weeks back, wondering if I was technically cheating by casually flirting (was absolutely not flirting back with intent to pursue, but genuinely was just doing it for fun at first) so I asked my best friend (lets call them Q, 27, queer, is a psychiatrist, is way more experienced in relationships than me) if I should confess to T that I've been flirting and ask them if they'd rather I stop (at the time of this convo I didn't have a crush on my coworker), but Q said absolutely don't talk to T about it because it would force them into a corner where they have to decide how serious they want their relationship with me to be, and since T has already expressed that they don't want to establish a relationship yet, I wouldn’t want to force their hand. Which makes sense to me and I didn't even think about that before coming to Q. Though Q did strongly advise that I stop flirting back, since it's with a coworker & because of our difference in age (shocker, I didn't stop bc I was enjoying it & didn't think I'd catch feelings), but said that it should be fine to explore outside of my dynamic with T since T wants to keep things lowkey & casual. Thoughts? Advice?

If it makes a difference, I'm on the asexual spectrum, so when I say dates/see other people I genuinely mean dates, not hookups (T & I haven't had sex yet either, but they're very inappropriately flirty at times & have expressed their desire to eventually, which I'm also down for).

TL;DR: I'm dating someone who has already established that they want to keep our dating casual for at least a couple more months. We can only meet up about once every other week for a couple hours over coffee or lunch. I want something a little more frequent than that but still really like them. Then my coworker started flirting heavily with me and I'm starting to catch feelings/am considering asking her out for drinks, but I don't want to stop talking to the person I'm currently dating either.

We found some wonderful restaurants down hidden side streets. Yes, we did go to two tourist traps; when my partner wants coffee, he wants it now. We also enjoyed two Michelin restaurants. 

My favourite exhibit was Botero's paintings at the Palazzo Boneparte.

I liked the gelato at Grom. You may disagree with me.

The only touts we saw were on the Roman side of the Vatican City border. No pickpockets.

By exploring the ransom streets of the inner city I was able to see many artisans working in their ateliers: book binders, furniture restoration, wood workers, jewelers, and many more.

1gy0rci,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellaHealth/comments/1gy0rci/6_weeks_in_personal_update_tirz_compound_and/,"6 weeks in - personal update, Tirz compound, and Fella review","Hi all. 47yo Male, SW 300lbs, Current weight 275lbs.  That is **25lbs in 6 weeks**! 

On Tirzepatide compound - pre-filled syringes.

First off - this stuff is amazing. I have tried for a couple years to get back down under 280lbs and just couldn't do it. Now, 6 weeks in and I am solidly at 275! It's working and has me excited.

I have more energy. My arthritic knee hurts less. My cycling power has increased tremendously. My knowledge of nutrition and how much to eat has improved. I understand glucose levels and energy for cycling better. It's been a great blessing.

I have not tired other GLPs so cannot compare to Sema or anything else. I have had very little in terms of side effects. I have done like others have said - -increase fiber daily. I usually drink 2 - 12oz glasses of water in the morning right away, 1 of them with a tsp (glug) of Benefiber. Occasionally will have a small bowl of oatmeal if I am riding my bike that day - addt'l fiber and raises my glucose. I also have a different fiber supplement from Garden of Life that I will add into protein drinks for a mid-afternoon snack or post-workout recovery drink. Also, try to increase the green leafy vegetables/fiber from veggies. I have not had any painful constipation so it seems to work well enough. I am a big fan of 'listen to your body, it tells you what it needs' and that seems to work for me.

Other side effects. For a bit starting out I had very vivid dreams about normal stuff. Sometimes weird crap that makes no sense. So they were never really nightmares or fantasies, just things like ordinary life thoughts -  driving the kids to school and cannot find them cause they don't communicate....or family get together with the in-laws - and a few more odd situations. but again not scary, just really vivid.

Sleep - it is really important to have your sleep pattern figured out when on this medicine to make it work to the best of its ability. Know when to shut off caffeine. I drink coffee and soda during the day and have had many nights of poor sleep. I have started shutting down caffeine earlier in the day and that has improved.  I don't drink alcohol anymore so that was a non-issue for me. (dm me if you are thinking about giving it up)

Exercise and glucose - I became cusious about the imact to my glucose production as I was reading that this med. would impact it. So I purchased a blood glucose tester from the big box store and started finger-pricking. It was very insightful. I am trusting a well know and recommended app for my 'normal' levels. My normal daily schedule is up at 7am - work 8-5am (still from home) at a desk, workout/kid activities/supper around 6:30/7pm bed at 10:30p. I found that if I stop eating with supper, my blood glucose level is on the low side come bed time. My thought is....the lower it is before bed, the more my body taps into my fat stores for energy while I sleep. Hence, the importance of continuous, non-stressful, sleep.

In talking with the Fella Health coach - Tyler - he said not to focus too much on one nutrient i.e. my obsession with glucose levels, but remember the overall goal for this. Which I agree - is body composition which includes weight and energy and mental health/confidence. Tyler helped me come up with a better plan - more intentional about how to manage my glucose levels so I could still race on my bike (yes even at 290lbs) and enjoy it. It's been a game changer for me. For other endurance athletes - check out the r/zepboundathletes forum for their stories. But basically now I drink a bottle of Tailwind (sports mix) before I ride and another bottle 15min into my ride and I am crushing hour long races at Vo2 max/Thres.+ on Zwift and loving it.

Now the Fella feedback. I have already shared this with different folks and some time gives perspective.

Initially I was very happy with the program. I appreciated all the texting from a real person. I appreciated that they were not trying to sell me on it. I am from the mid-west part of the U.S. and was taught to be very frugal albeit skeptical of prices. If you ask my wife, it's not something that I should be proud of as it often annoys her and others when I talk about how much stuff costs. But when I mentioned that I was concerned about the cost I asked, is there someone I could talk to so I can understand it better, and yes - Jordan was able to meet with me and spent over a half-hour talking through my concerns. I was prepared with a list of experiences from other folks, what made guys successful on this vs. fail, how to spread the cost out, etc. He answered all my questions and concerns and made extra time for me.

I signed up for the 1 month of Tirz. due to the cost. Figured I could commit $x00 and if it didn't respond well, then it would at least give me time to decide how to go forward.

Once I signed up - the lab test came and I filled out what I could on Fella's site/metrics and started reading up on how to prepare for taking the medicine here in this forum. It was super helpful but I had some anxiety about committing to it for more than a month. I was hopeful it would result in quick weight loss.

At that point communication from Fella became a bit confusing. I started receiving e-mails and alerts from people I had not spoken with or knew were going to be contacting me. I thought my contact throughout the program would be the program lead I spoke with to sign up for the medicine. It kind of felt like I went from someone who heard my concerns to just another number/customer.

I waited until the Saturday evening to take the 1st dose. There is no place to log on the Fella site, when you take your dose. (simple fix Fella).

Oddly, my 2nd package of pre-filled syringes arrived very early - like over 2 weeks before I needed it. I also, did not ask to renew yet as I knew they would want me to pay another $x00 for the 2nd month.  Given what I said above about my concerns with cost, this really ramped my anxiety. Eventually, Stanley and I texted and even had a phone call about the situation. BTW - he is AMAZING. He helped me talk through everything with patience and understood. He helped me make a decision on continuing and I agreed to the 6 month program. He also connected me with Tyler - even though his schedule is over full - which was also a blessing. These 2 guys and their personal connection with me - is worth the cost of the program. Fella - you need more Stanley's & Tyler's.

We are buying less in groceries. Not buying chips, ice cream, sweets. More high protein foods - eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, chicken, fish, burger, frozen veggies.

We are buying less in ordering out - pizza, sub sandwiches, restaurants. Went to Tono's pizza and cheese steaks and brought half the food home that I normally eat there. Also, it was not as appetizing knowing there would be a glut of cheese and grease in my stomach for a long time.

At my kids h.s. Football banquet - with a buffet of chicken alfredo and spag. w/meatballs and salad. I filled half my plate with salad and about 1/2 what I would normally take of pasta. I ate enough and even forgot about the bread on the table. So, simply removing the food noise and making you feel full when you start eating results in less intake - period.

Today, I start my 6th dose of Tirz., 2nd dose at 5mg. again, pre-filled syringe. Seems like every time I take a dose, it results in a slight weight loss and reduces my food noise and hunger levels. So that I look forward to.

Overall, very happy with the efficacy of the pre-filled syringes of Tirz.

Overall, happy with the service from Fella. Would like a few things to be improved both on their website and with their customer interactions but understand with the volume of people in the program and knowing everyone wants different levels of interaction.

If you have read through this thus far - congrats. If you are in doubt, pull the trigger, get in touch with Stanley & sign up for a health coaching meeting. Reach out to the guys in here, they are super helpful.",3,1732371920.0,FellaHealth,0,1.0,False

https://tchibo.us/products/limited-edition-the-tchibo

As a thank you present she bought one for my wife and we have used it the past week. Here are my initial thoughts. 
(For reference, my daily work routine has a consistent fresh grind setup in a Cuisinart thermal brewer so I take mine at 4am and hers is still ready at 6 or whenever she gets up)

The flavor is very consistent based on beans used. I’ve tried Lavazza Crema and the Espresso beans and the less oily Espresso beans work better. Taste better too. 
It’s hard to change beans - extracting beans from the hopper would be easier if it was removable like the water reservoir. 
The used puck chamber senses itself full after different quantities of cups. Once after only 3-4 and another time after 5-6. 
The initial heating cycle dispenses hot water to be discarded. Why can’t it simply pump this back into the reservoir?
I had to install the taller bean reservoir because the regular one seems to empty after 4 cups. Why isn’t a taller water reservoir available?
Espresso is perfect for my taste from this $300+ machine. 

She bought a separate milk frother for $35 that seems to work well. I’m typically a black coffee drinker but she enjoys the foam topper and this does a fine job.

I have difficulty following things through in sequence, reading/eye trkackung foe reading, understanding what people say, I have short term memory issues, executive function issues, as well as brain fog. 

Stimulant meds and coffee worked somewhat but didn't bring that crystal calm or transformation that others experience (and they increased my anxiety and paranoia) while benzodiazepines actually did calm me down enough to do things that I could not before. Also cleared some brain fog. 

Unfortunately, benzodiazepines were unsustainable because of the effect they had on my mood (withdrawal and rebound). 

Over the years I had encountered people on the spectrum, with POTS, and other conditions who said that they needed to add salt to their food and water to feel better. I also noticed feeling better after eating more salt. What's more is that I feel so chill after IV rehydration.

Then recently after having to go on a clear liquid diet and drink a lot of electrolytes, particularly sodium and potassium, (a bottle of Gatorade) I realized I was able to sit for a long block of time and focus. A lot of the mental and emotional noise inside had calmed down as well. I freaked out a little because I almost felt too still, like a zombie (how folks sometimes feel when they take stimulant drugs).

With keystone. Budget is around \~$700, preferably less. 4k is cool but not important. I game sometimes but it's not very important to me, but low input lag would be great if possible. Not much ambient light in my room. Screen would be an angled ceiling which is why I need the keystone btw.

Also I'd like to add that it's preferable to get no screen, I have an almost white (milk coffee) wall, but if you think it's absolutely necessary then fine but if possible no screen.",1,1732371684.0,budgetprojectors,0,1.0,False

1gy0l42,https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/1gy0l42/how_do_i_approach_this/,How do I approach this?,"I (35F INFP) have gotten to know an ISTJ (37M) over the last two years and started to develop some feelings for him. We kind of work together, but not really. We work for separate companies in different states that are owned by the same larger company. Our teams have started to work together more. Because we work together in some capacity, I’m intentionally moving slow because it could be awkward to tell him all my feelings and deal with the aftermath if he doesn’t feel the same, and then have to continue to lead our teams together.

It does seem like he has some feelings towards me and others have asked me what’s going on with us. He went out of his way to do some things when I was traveling to his company recently: cleaned my rental car, brought me dinner to my hotel, and took me out to breakfast/coffee every morning. I also mentioned in passing to a coworker that I forgot to bring some essential items on this trip and that I'd have to run to the store. He overheard and went to the store during his lunch break and bought the items for me. One of his coworkers told me that she was so surprised by his actions with me because he never does anything like that for anyone else.

In person and having face-to-face conversations flow effortlessly and it all feels very natural/comfortable. Most of our conversations lately happen through texting. I know texting can be difficult to have full blown conversations in, but there’s been a few times now where he’s initiated texting and then will drop off the planet and never reply for weeks. He’ll be reminded of my text when I have to reach out about a work thing in our work group chats or emails. I get super excited whenever we talk and sad when it dies so suddenly, lol.

Anyway, I’ll be traveling to their office in a few weeks and we’ll have some in-person time. I’d like to get some ISTJ perspectives or advice about this overall situation and ground my daydreamy INFP brain, please. This is the only ISTJ I’ve ever met, that I know of. My closest friends are all INFP/ENFP and their advice has been, “just kiss him already!” Haha 🥲",3,1732371419.0,ISTJ,1,1.0,False

A couple friends of mine suggested I try cuddlebuddies, so here goes. Thank you all for your openness and support! 

I am 38 and am looking for a local cuddle buddy around my age. I work as a sailor and miss cuddles and warm hugs! Every year I find myself wishing I could find someone to play in the snow with, and then cuddle and have hot chocolate with, but it is yet to happen. Please note I'm not looking for anything sexual, but if we enjoy each other's company, I would be up for possibly dating as well. 

I enjoy coffee, exploring random places in Boston, yoga, several outdoor activities, learning foreign languages, and watching foreign language movies. If you can cuddle me while speaking to me in Russian, I might be yours. 🙂

I look forward to hearing from you, and best of luck on your cuddle search, whatever it may be! 🙂",2,1732371397.0,cuddlebuddies,2,1.0,False
