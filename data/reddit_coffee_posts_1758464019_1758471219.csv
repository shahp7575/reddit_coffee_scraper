1nmvzr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrientalOrthodoxy/comments/1nmvzr3/goal_of_life_and_civilization/,goal of life and civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1nmvzab,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nmvzab/aita_for_waking_my_mil_up_in_scary_costumes/,AITA for waking my MIL up in scary costumes because she keeps me up at night?,"So my MIL has been staying with us until the end of the month because she’s “between leases.” My husband offered her our guest room, and I tried to be gracious about it… but I’m running on fumes and I snapped in a very petty way.

For context: I work from home as a nail tech. I officially start seeing clients around 8:30 AM, but I get up at 5 AM. Between prep, sanitizing, and setting up my workstation, I need that quiet morning time. It makes really good money, and it works out well because my husband is a surgeon and his hours are all over the place. We balance each other. But that balance has been absolutely shredded since MIL moved in.

She keeps me up constantly with her:

1. Nighttime nonsense. She’ll knock on our bedroom door at 11:30 or midnight because she “just remembered something” or thinks she heard a noise outside. She’ll put the TV on full blast in the living room directly below us because she “can’t sleep without sound.” She microwaves snacks at 1 AM. Basically, I never get a full night’s rest.

2. Nosiness. She critiques everything in the fridge, rearranges my kitchen cabinets, and makes backhanded comments like, “Oh, you do nails from home? Isn’t that just a hobby?”

3. Bathroom hog. I’ve been late for clients because she sits in our only upstairs bathroom for nearly an hour every morning, scrolling on her phone with the door locked.

4. Condescending commentary. She tells me I shouldn’t drink so much coffee, suggests I should “dress up more for my clients,” and acts like I’m 15 years old instead of a grown adult running my own successful business.

After about two weeks of this, I was sleep-deprived to the point of tears. My husband never noticed because he can sleep through anything (surgeon privilege, I guess).

So… I snapped.

The first time, I decided if she was going to keep me awake at random times, I was going to wake her up at random times. But not just wake her up. Make it memorable. I’m not just a nail tech—I’m also one hell of a makeup artist (not to toot my own horn, but my Halloween looks are infamous among my friends and kids).

So the next morning after she kept me up until 1 AM, I put on my old creepy clown costume. Full prosthetic makeup, shadowy eye sockets, painted grin, rainbow wig. At 6:30 AM, I leaned over her bed and whispered, “Good morning” in the darkest voice I could muster. She screamed.

Another night, she woke me up at 12:15 because she “smelled gas.” (Spoiler: she had left the oven on herself.) So the following morning I wore my inflatable T-rex suit, painted shadows on the mask thingy to make it scarier, and stomped into her room in the dark. She nearly fell out of bed.

Then came the grizzly bear. I painted myself up to look wild, added shadows under my eyes, and crouched on all fours right next to her face at 5:45 AM. A low growl woke her.

I’ve done this three or four times now, at random intervals—because she keeps me up at random times. Funny enough, since I started this, I’ve actually slept better. I think it’s partly catharsis and partly because she’s been quieter at night, maybe out of fear that I’ll repay her in kind. And yeah—I’ll admit it, I’m probably a bitch for scaring an old woman like this. But when you’re bone-tired, petty, and done with someone treating your home like a playground, you stop caring about being nice.

The problem? She told my husband. He had no idea this was happening, and when he found out, he absolutely lit into me. He said I was being “cruel,” “unstable,” and “harassing” his mother. I told him I was just meeting her energy with the same level of disruption she was giving me. He argued that I should have told him and he would’ve handled it, but he’s never awake to see what she does.

Now he’s saying I need to apologize to her. I feel like she should apologize to me for wrecking my peace, my sleep, and my sanity in my own house. So, AITA and who should apologize to who? (I’m provably going to end up apologizing because I feel bad. I just need second opinions.)

1nmvvcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1nmvvcr/huso_1110_hisa_franko_310_the_best_meal_of_my/,"Huso 11/10, Hisa Franko 3/10 - The best meal of my life compared to a subpar experience for three Michelin stars","I was convinced by a post here several months back to go to Huso, Chef Buddah Lo's restaurant in NYC. My wife and I love fine dining and have been to more than 10 fine dining experiences each separately and together. We are fans of Top Chef, so we were really excited to try this restaurant and taste Chef Buddah's food.

Our experience at Huso was one of the best nights of our lives and the best dining experience I have ever had. Each dish was memorably delicious. Sorry, I didn't take pictures but every dish was exquisitely presented and one of the best things I have ever tasted. The wine pairing, which my wife and I split, was presented in huge and unique glassware and perfectly enhanced every dish. Service was impeccable, friendly, and coordinated like theatre. The room was jovial and fun, it felt like being at a party. At the end of the night, the bill, which was \~$1,000, felt like a bargain.

My wife and I talk about this meal every day. We can name all of the dishes and I crave every one. Most spectacular were the king salmon with quail egg, caviar and brown butter cream; sphere of foie gras on the best brioche I've ever had; tomato spheres; squab; and also the wine pairing stands out as exceptional, presented gorgeously in creative glasses, uniquely flavored, and a flavor enhancing pairing.

Portions were perfect, you left very full but you wanted to eat every last bite. We asked to split the wine pairing and they poured two generous half portions in a glass for each of us. We were invited into the kitchen for an off menu drink. We both made a visit to a luxurious restroom during the roughly three hour meal. While there was an opportunity to buy more caviar and truffles, we declined. Still there were three courses with caviar, including a dark chocolate truffle with caviar that I never would have believed could have worked so well.

In all, we left buzzed, full, and still went out to a comedy show after. This has got to be some of the best money I ever spent. I went back to look at the review from reddit and realized we had totally different courses, which leaves me even more amazed they can achieve that. I want to go back right away.

Moving on. Let’s talk about my experience with Hisa Franko in the Soca Valley in Slovenia. Now, I don't want to create a list of grievances about Hisa Franko since the title spoils the bad review. I think everything was very well prepared and tasty. I think the food mostly accomplishes the goal of the restaurant which is to showcase local ingredients. I don't want to quibble with costs, the 2 meals and one wine pairing and cocktails was 882 euro. We stayed at the hotel which was in a beautiful location and very nice.

We did not read google reviews before we went but the main complaints are correct. We saw the show on Chef's Table.

We arrived, we checked in and were invited to have a cocktail at 6:30 before our dinner. The cocktails were 21 euro each and very delicious. They forgot our order and then had to come ask us again.

At 7, we sat in the dining room, ordered a split wine pairing - which would be in one glass - and the courses began. Each course was ok. Every course felt like a missed opportunity. There was a quail egg and caviar dish served on ""garden leaves"" that just fell flat. You couldn't taste the individual components. The hay baked potato smells like hay but tastes like baked potato. You are instructed to use a wooden spoon to add honey and sour cream to it. The honey and sour cream are delicious, but you are using a wooden spoon to break off bits of baked potato and dip them in it. It's not the best way to have the most delicious bite each time, and it isn't typical of fine dining I've had before. It felt very awkward. The other famous dish, the corn beignet, again is beautiful, it was well prepared. It tasted ok.

Mostly everything came with a lot of flowers on it, but failed to deliver on the promised flavors on the menu. There was a melon and clam pasta that was over powered by a coffee oil, and undercooked to my preference. There was flowers with a tiny bit of squid that you eat in one bite? That doesn't scream Soca valley to me. It didn't leave me wanting to eat it again. The Orzotto with  two sauces and watermelon was interesting. I finished it.

There were flashes of brilliance. The late summer harvest, which is one leaf of everything from the garden, was elevated by its sauce. The deer, delicious, but only two bites. Trout, delicious, but to be honest, the third best trout I had in Slovenia. It was served on a slice of apple with a dollop of puree, three bites. Dessert, a cheese dumpling. I would say every dish at Huso was better than the best dish at Hisa Franko.

The real tragedy was the wine pairing. It did not elevate any dish, it did not offer any unique flavors, and it was portioned outrageously small. The portion we shared in one glass was less than the portion in each glass at Huso. I can confidently say two weeks and many 10 mL glasses of wine into my trip say it was 5mL. They give you the wine list, and you can look up the prices. The markup is outrageous.

Finally, the atmosphere is funereal. No table was smiling. American classic rock like Van Halen and REO Speedwagon played too loudly from above and felt disjointed from the experience.

Service was fine. They tried to do the theater thing but it was clumsy. At the end, with no more courses coming, after telling us not to go to the bathroom until the next course, and how to eat every dish including the number of bites; we were left without the bill and no instructions on ""Could we leave yet?"" We were still hungry, but we knew we were at the end of the menu. Perhaps they hoped I would order more wine because we had split about two glasses between us?

As we were eating the meal, and realizing there is no way that the rest of the meal and wine pairing can live up to the eye watering price tag, noticing the lack of smiling in the room, it became an effort to keep upbeat so that we could attempt to enjoy the meal through the last course of spicy sunflower chocolate. When leaving, the staff asked how everything was and I replied truthfully that everything was excellently prepared.

The moral of this story I guess is, you can still have the best night of your life at fine dining. Make sure to read the reviews first though. And go to Huso. I brought up the reddit post that convinced me to go to their staff and they immediately knew about it. Just like everything else that night, the restaurant was on top of everything.",1,1758470697.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

I just got back from my Greece and turkey experience. To give a little bit of background, I have been on a total of five (including this trip) NCL cruises and just wanted to share my thoughts about this trip. 

My fiancé and I went on the Norwegian Viva (her first time ever being on a cruise). Without making this feel like a novel to read, I will try to break down the pros and cons of my experience. I also need to mention what was our excursion. We flew in a few days early to Athens to enjoy the time change and the city before getting on the ship. After that, the following itinerary: 

- Volos 
- Kusadasi 
- Istanbul (2 days) 
- Santorini 
-Crete
-Mykonos 
- Rhodes 

Then back to Athens to fly home same day

PROS: 

The Ship: 
this was a very impressive ship and the biggest one I’ve ever been on. I was able to place a small bed to get a balcony suite instead of an interior suite (for 270 a person). My first time ever having a balcony suite hand it to me feels like it makes a big difference, especially if you are a couple that one of you is extroverted and one of you is introverted. She was able to retreat back to the room and read a book on a balcony if she wanted to while I got to enjoy socializing in the deck festivities.

The Buffet: 
I personally have never had a bad breakfast/lunch/dinner experience using the buffet on Norwegian. Each day they always switch it up like they usually do and the food was really good. My fiancé and I for half of the trip went to the restaurants and the other half of the trip we did the buffet and I was very impressed. 

Entertainment: 
they never fail when it comes to this. Sure there are shows that are probably better than others but this time it was game shows and the Beetlejuice experience which was actually really fun. Our favorite was the Syd Norman Pour House with the rock ‘n’ roll tribute/music. 

Staff***: 
I would say the staff was professional and on point when it came to the front desk or any sort of housekeeping services, they were solid (shout out to Arnel for Housekeeping and Terrence at Guest Services) a lot of these staff members were really good at reading people and knowing when to crack jokes and want to be professional, and it really felt like that you were a part of the crew on board. The reason why I put an Asterix will be in my con section. 

CONS: 

The Mandara Spa and Staff: 
please don’t really kill me in the comment section. I’m not sure if the spa works outside of Norwegian Cruise line as a separate Entity or not but this place was a nightmare to deal with. because I proposed to my girlfriend on this trip, I decided to pamper her and we got a few spa treatments. We did a facial a deep tissue massage and a blowout for her hair. We talked to one of the managers and we calculate it out with the gratuity. This would all be totaled out to 520 bucks give or take. 

The massage lasted under an hour because the masseuse spent the first 30 minutes, trying to upsell aggressively, and my fiancé was trying to be kind of repeatedly turned her down. She didn’t even do her neck and didn’t spend a lot of time on her shoulders and just did her back arms and legs. She then booked without her permission an ice therapy consultation, which was about a $300 charge on top of a $46 gratuity on top of that without her permission.

The woman who did her facial was amazing so we can skip that.

There was a gentleman that was doing her hair blowout, and he kept trying to aggressively upsell her on products and she would kindly tell him no he then put a protein chemicals in her hair to have her “try it out”. She didn’t want this, but he already quickly through the product in her hair and massaged it in before she could back away. He then told her to close her eyes and put some sort of fake tan. Something to make it look like she got sun on her cheeks which again she didn’t ask for.

My fiancé is a very porcelain skinned, curly haired ginger and takes very good care of her hair and skin so she was very upset when these things were put on her. 

The next day, I tried to get a refund and they jerk you around by telling you to go to the front desk to get the refund and then they throw you back upstairs onto the 16th floor to talk to the spa manager, but then if he’s not there, send you back downstairs, etc. We finally were able to get in front of him and there was already 12 people in line filing other types of complaints that I also wanted to file. We eventually got a refund on the ice therapy consultation and the gratuity charge that was on that and for a few of the products but not everything.

The spa was very predatory, and unless you really get aggressive back with these people, they will try to take advantage of you. 

The Constant Reminders of packages we don’t have: 
the last time I took a cruise was about nine years ago. I didn’t have an alcohol package or any major packages back then. My fiancé and I do not drink a lot and we didn’t know if we wanted to get the dinner package because we didn’t know if we were going to be at every restaurant every night or just a few. Every time we went to a bar on any section of the deck it was just a constant reminder of “oh you should’ve gotten the drinking package it would’ve saved you” or “ oh, you don’t have the dinner package? It’s a great package you should’ve picked it up, etc..” 

I’m on the fence about talking about this one a little bit just because I understand that they are also in sales and are trying to remind folks about these package opportunities, also probably to remind people, so they don’t complain about their bill at the end about all the charges they were not aware of. I was aware of them,and it just made me feel bad every time I went to a bar to have just a few drinks over the trip that we had or sitting in a restaurant and being consistently reminded that we are lower class or something. I will take partial responsibility on that feeling because maybe I’m taking it a little too hard but in the years of seal with Norwegian, I never felt the sense of I didn’t spend enough money nor to really enjoy this cruise. It is really rare that my fiancé and I go on vacation and one of the reasons why I loved about Norwegian cruise line is the feeling that you are getting the best vacation regardless of how much money you put into it and this wasn’t an inexpensive trip by any means. 


THE TRIP ITSELF: 

The excursions: when you go to the main cities, the excursions were great like they were in Athens, and Istanbul. After we got back from the truck, we talked about the other places and this is our opinion: 

Athens: 
like I said we were there for the first 2 1/2 days did our own excursions of historical and beautiful sites, amazing food, and friendly locals to help you with walking around town. We are both hooked on their Fredo Espresso and cappuccinos. 

Volos: 
we did the beach excursion and they had to change the beach location to somewhere else due to the logistic reason: the beach we went to was beautiful and it was a very relaxing time. The only complaint that I had was it was over an hour to drive to the beach location, which only gave you two hours to relax and enjoy it before having to drive the our back. We felt that if we had one more hour to enjoy the water and the scenery. It wouldn’t be that big of a deal.

Kusadasi: 
this was my fiancé’s favorite place out of the entire trip. Seeing the ruins and the castle and going to the silkworm workshop to know how they make all the Turkish rugs was super cool plus we had time to eat some traditional Turkish food, which is amazing.

Istanbul: 
what a beautiful and amazing experience to spend two days here we did the first day the 8 1/2 hour tour to see all the ottoman empire and Constantinople sites and it was a freaking blast!!! we all had time to eat at a beautiful rooftop hotel overlooking the city and the food of course amazing

The second day we did the grand bizarre it was fun to actually haggle and get some cool stuff for my fiancé and myself . Overall 10 out of 10 experience.

Santorini: 
this may be controversial for some people, but this was my least favorite stop on the entire trip. TV shows and movies from the 70s up to the 2000s have done an amazing job with PR campaigns to say how beautiful and majestic this place is. Honestly, it sucked. Being on a bus, a majority of the tour, our tour guide was a little rude, and the iconic place to take a photo was so jampacked on that pig trough size street that it was just exhausting to get a decent photo because everybody’s looking for their Instagram/only fans shot for their social media pages. We went to a Greek restaurant right after that with traditional dancing in music, which I really liked. The buffet that they served a lot of it was lukewarm, if not cold and it seemed like it was an afterthought. 

We were told that the stairs would take too long to walk down to the boat so we decided to do the cable car from the top of the cliff all the way down to the boat, which the waiting time in that line was a an hour and a half Which almost put a lot of people in jeopardy of missing the boat at 9 PM. Again, this is our opinion if you enjoyed Santorini, that’s great to hear.

Crete: 
It’s a big island and I know with only seven hours you can’t see every historical site. I will take partial responsibility on this opinion because I feel like I chose the wrong excursion.  We chose the cretion, history and flavors. We were on a bus for an hour and a half just to drive to a monastery, which was great, but in my opinion wasn’t worth the hour and a half drive. Then we actually went to Heiroklin and it was a very historical city. We did a lot of walking around, and the food of the restaurant was impeccable that we ate at. I was hoping that there would be a lot more restaurant and drink stops if we’re talking about the flavors of a place instead of just one restaurant. I would say the frustrating part was a lot of people are two didn’t want to pay the one euro to go to the bathroom (also we were in a restaurant that they could’ve used it for free and chose not to) so instead of getting back to the bus 20 minutes early so we could relax and lay by the pool. We had a pool over to some random supermarket in the middle of nowhere so people can use the bathroom and get snacks. I thought we were gonna be seeing a lot more historical sites for the time that we were allotted, but we only saw maybe two and I thought the Knosses and Minotaur we’re going to be a part of it, but it’s its own separate tour guide (hence I take partial responsibility for this opinion). 

Mykonos: when I think of Greece with beautiful people and beautiful beaches and an iconic experience, this is the place that we loved! Yes, it’s expensive but they explained that a lot of rich people and celebrities hang out here so a lot of their stores are geared towards wealthy people. We got to put our feet in the water have a few glasses of champagne and people watch

Rhodes: another beautiful place we went to Lindos with a beautiful town and have authentic Greek food as usual and coffee. The Knights Temple are St. John’s bastion/cast on the top of the hill was really cool in the history was great. Lotta great scenic views and the water is beautiful. I could’ve skipped the pottery shop experience, but it was nice to see. 

Anyway, this was my opinion and would love to hear if anybody else was on the trip as well and what they thought or something very similar. I’m looking forward to my next cruise hopefully in the next 2 to 3 years everyone have a wonderful rest of your day.",1,1758470308.0,NCL,1,0.67,False

Right from the unboxing, this little gadget screamed convenience with its compact design and thoughtful lavender blush color that added a dash of elegance to my kitchen counter. While using it for the past few weeks, I’ve realized both the strengths and the occasional hiccups that come with this handheld milk frother.

**Durable and Simple Design**  
What immediately caught my attention was its lightweight frame, weighing less than 10 ounces. It feels sturdy, yet it’s incredibly easy to hold and operate. Constructed from stainless steel, it has a robust look that reassured me it wouldn’t succumb to wear and tear easily. The inclusion of a metal stand was a bonus—after using it, it rests elegantly without creating clutter. Plus, the lavender blush finish? Charming and unique, a break from the usual utilitarian kitchen gadgets.

**Ease of Use and Performance**  
Operating it is as simple as pressing a single button on the top. Within seconds of turning it on, it transforms milk into creamy, velvety froth. I’ve tried it with whole milk, soy, and even almond milk, and it delivered consistent results every single time. Making a professional-looking cappuccino without stepping outside my house felt fabulous. My younger sibling—who has zero patience for advanced kitchen gadgets—borrowed it to froth creamer for her iced coffee, and even she raved about how beginner-friendly it is. 

**Highlights**  
- Extremely easy to use with a simple one-button operation.  
- Compact and lightweight design that fits easily in drawers or on the counter with the stand.  
- Capable of frothing various kinds of milk—from dairy to plant-based options.

**Efficiency for More Than Just Coffee**  
What truly justified it as a staple in my kitchen was its versatility. Beyond making frothy lattes, I ended up using this for whisking matcha (it’s shockingly better than the traditional whisk) and blending protein powders into my morning shakes. No clumps, no fuss—just perfectly smooth drinks. I even found it handy for whipping small amounts of cream for desserts. That said, there’s a bit of a learning curve when blending thicker liquids, as the motor may struggle occasionally.

**Drawbacks**  
- Requires 4 AA batteries, and heavier use might drain them quicker than expected.  
- The cleanup, while simple, still requires care to avoid liquid getting into the mechanism.  

**Easy Maintenance with a Catch**  
Another notable aspect is how straightforward the cleaning process is. A quick rinse under warm running water with the whisk turned on leaves it spotless. However, one word of caution: you need to ensure water doesn’t enter the base where the motor resides. It’s manageable once you’re mindful, but I admit I was nervous the first couple of times I tried. 

**Competing Brands**  
Looking at alternatives like the PowerLix Handheld Frother and the AeroLatte, the Zulay product held its ground in several areas. The AeroLatte comes with a slightly sleeker finish, but it’s pricier without offering significantly better performance. Meanwhile, the PowerLix boasts a rechargeable option, which eliminates the need for replacing batteries. However, I found the Zulay frother’s overall durability and consistency more reliable, especially given its lifetime warranty.

**Value for Money**  
The real question is whether it’s worth your hard-earned cash. What sets this apart is the combination of excellent frothing ability, portability, and price point. It gives you café-style froth in seconds without asking for a significant investment, making it a bang-for-the-buck option for your coffee needs.

We’re both university students, and we met through a group project. Due to group members not contributing, the two of us essentially completed a semester long project as a pair. We spent a lot of late nights in the lab together, where we realized we had a lot in common and quickly became friends. He is aware that I am not attracted to men.

Our friendship, from my perspective, was 100% platonic both ways until a mutual friend forced both of us to attend a party a few months ago. I did not drink, but my friend got drunk. I went with him back to his apartment, and he kept talking about how happy he was to be able to go to the party with me and how much he admired me. This was right before finals, so I decided to temporarily ignore it.

I proceeded to forget about it until this summer, when he decided he was going to visit me during my internship. We were working in different parts of the US, so this would require a plane ticket. That’s a lot of money for a student.  While he visited me, he didn’t appear to act any differently around me than he had previously. However I think this is worth mentioning due to the expense of a plane ticket.

After both of our internships ended, I agreed to help him move back to school. We roadtripped across the US. One night, we went stargazing since we were in the middle of nowhere. He made comment after comment about how happy he was to have been able to do this with me, and how there was no one he would have rather been with.

When we got back to school, he started trying to spend as much time as physically possible with me. If I was studying in the library, he’ll try to meet up with me. If I’m stopping at a coffee shop, he’ll try to go with me. If I’m walking to class and he sees me, he’ll walk with me to my class before going to his destination. Every weekend he wants to try and spend time with me as well. I keep telling him that he doesn’t have to walk me places, that I don’t want to do anything over the weekend, that I have too much HW but I’m going to work on it from my apartment. He doesn’t seem to really understand that I’m trying to set a boundary.

Additionally, he’s started initiating a lot of physical contact with me. He’ll regularly bump his arm into mine, or grab my arm. He hasn’t done anything that’s inappropriate for a friend to do. I rarely initiate physical contact with anyone, so this is a lot for me. I don’t know if I’m overthinking it or not.

I’m about 99% he has feelings me. I’m assuming he just isn’t aware that he does, as he is well aware that I am not attracted to men. He’s also not very in touch with his own emotions. How should I approach this?

Additionally, I have always prioritized my work over potential romantic relationships, so if I were to start talking about women that I find attractive, he would think something is up.",1,1758470218.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1nmvmz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbedroom/comments/1nmvmz6/tired_and_broken/,Tired and broken,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Throwaway account. I will try to explain this simply, but I know it’s more nuanced than I am presenting it here.

I (45M) am married to a LL (43F), who is a serial cheater, who hasn’t seen a doctor, doesn’t communicate and shuts down whenever conversation as inconvenient or difficult.

I don’t even know why I am posting this, I know this isn’t looking good.

So here’s the shortest one sided view of my marriage:

I met my wife in high school. She was always an extremely sexual person, she always knew what, why and when she wanted it. She was and is still extremely attractive. She is the center of my universe.

I was afraid of sex. My Christian religious upbringing made me believe I had to “wait until marriage” and even then, I felt guilty for enjoying sex even years into our marriage. She was more religious than I was, but she had no trouble with sex at all.

The first time she cheated on me was in college. I going to class, living with her, my (much older) cousin and his (much older) friend. She slept with both of them.
I was devastated, but she used sex as a weapon, and she wielded the weapon like a pro. We moved into separate apartments and we started working on things. We communicated. I learned that one of the main reasons she cheated was because I didn’t provide for her sexual needs. We worked on it, and about 3 years later we were living together, seemingly happy, and I learned she had a full blown affair. She wanted to leave me to be with him. They worked together.

I was devastated. By this point I had a career, I was providing really well, but admittedly I was working longer hours than she was. I kicked her out, and, when her alternative partner left the country, she realized she was alone and she started working extremely hard to “win” me back. She used her body, and her sexual skills in ways I had no defense against. Eventually I yielded, we agreed to try again, and she got pregnant almost immediately. I was over the moon with joy, because I wanted to be a dad, and this was happening.
We got married, and soon the went started saying things like “you only married me because I was pregnant”. This hurt and I always denied it, because it’s not true. I tried to work things out because I loved her. (I still do).

We married young, she had her sexual desires, and I was somewhat incompatible, because I was still afraid of sex, but all my failings aside, I was trying really hard. Other than sex, things were great. We had a kid, we were partners, we were parents. Things were good.

Fast forward a few years, and my career had developed, and a specific project caused our entire team to work long hours, and we traveled frequently too. My wife started modeling, and she was getting a lot of attention. I was supportive.

Then it happened. She was seduced by an actor. Not some well known celebrity but by someone who was on television. She cheated and she lied to my face about it when she had the opportunity to talk about it safely. By the time I figured out what was going on, I was furious. I was done.
This marriage wasn’t going to work if I pretended that I was ever going to be “enough” for her sexually. She wanted permission to “go to awards ceremonies” with this guy, she “wanted to be his date”. She signed me up for swinger websites, encouraging me to “get laid”. We talked about things a lot, and after I called her alternate partner and gave him a piece of my mind, he walked away. 

Every time she cheated, she would swear that she would never hurt me like that again, only to do it again a few years later. This time I told my wife in no uncertain terms that if this marriage continued, I will not pretend that she will not cheat again. The only way forward (for me) was to accept that she wants more sex than I could ever give, and for me to let go of whatever notion I had about sex. I made it clear that if we did it together, in a safe space, then maybe this could work. We joined a few “lifestyle” websites and we tried to see if this could work for us. We made a few friends, had a little fun, but it just didn’t work.
She sabotaged every step of the way, and the truth is I was learning how do any of this, and I was awkward, and the reality is I went from extremely private, shy, conservative to open minded swinger. I opened my mind, and worked extremely hard to meet her needs.
Yet, it wasn’t working, and she made things extremely complicated and difficult. It felt like I was changing my entire belief system to be more compatible with her, but she was just sabotaging and not doing much else.
I was broken, desperate and digging deep to find a way forward that didn’t include being away from the woman I love, and my children.
Eventually I told her I am going to sleep with someone else, and she was very excited because she thought I was bluffing. I wasn’t. I had decided that the only way to see this through, to get her to see me, was for me to find someone else on my own. So I did. 

This sent her entire world crashing down. I think what shocked her the most was how quickly I was able to do this when I decided to, and that the other woman was completely smitten with me. To be clear, I was perfectly honest with the other woman, she knew exactly what I was doing, and why. It may even be that the only reason she was doing this with me was because she was desperate for someone to do for her, to go as far for her, as I was doing for my wife. I think if I had asked the other woman to marry me, she would have. But I didn’t and I never intended to, and I was very clear about this.

Suddenly my wife wasn’t the only one who had options anymore. This changed our dynamic entirely.
After this, she decided we shouldn’t be “in the lifestyle”, anymore. We moved countries. When we settled into our new country we agreed not to pursue “the lifestyle”. We left it back in our home country. A couple of years went by, and I became a lot more successful in my career. She didn’t have to work and had a lot of free time. The kids grew to be teenagers. Things were good. 

Then, one night in 2019, she had a very sudden change. From one minute to the next, she went from seemingly happy, to utterly depressed. I tried talking to her, and I was caring but nothing worked. She had shut down. Over time, she seemed more happy again, but the sex had stopped. If I didn’t initiate, nothing happened. When something happened, it was really like she was doing a chore. Whenever it seemed like something was going to happen, she would do something to ensure the mood was killed.

Every time I brought up a conversation about our sex life she would shut down. If I was lucky enough to get any sort of explanation, her explanation was always that I wasn’t doing something. I didn’t agree, I felt I was doing plenty, but I didn’t argue, I just started doing more. Small things, like making her coffee everyday. I never left her to do the dishes. I did more than I ever had, and the truth is I enjoyed doing it.
Yet nothing changed. It was like a game she was playing by telling me to do something, just so that I would be kept busy doing whatever that was. By 2022 I tried again to talk to her about it, but again, she shuts down and won’t communicate. The one thing she did say was that it didn’t seem like I was attracted to her anymore. So I started holding back coffee, until she showed me her breasts. I made a big thing about seeing them every time, and it became a playful thing for us, where coffee was no longer “free”. This is just an example, I feel like I have many such examples.

By 2024, she has problems with her family. She is no longer talking to her parents, so I know things are hard for her, but I’m supportive.
 
Yesterday she decided that I had “done something wrong” and she ignored me. She was on the couch last night and I was flabbergasted why. Then my daughter unexpectedly came home (she doesn’t sleep at home all the time anymore now that she is in her 20s) and my wife, wanting to pretend to the outside world that everything is fine, comes back to our bedroom.  Took this moment to say “enough”. 

Funny thing is, she used me asking to see her breasts before coffee as a weapon. Apparently, all I want from her, and all she is good for, is sex. I’m shocked. I think my entire married life is anchored on sex, and a husband and wife should have a sexual relationship. Anyway…

As you can imagine, it’s my fault. I don’t know her, I don’t try. Whatever, I’ve heard all the excuses at this point.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. The obvious seems so unappealing, because divorce, at 45, after I had already done so much to work on this marriage seems awful.

‍

**Why This Pick?**

The Colts have been putting mad points on the board this first couple of weeks, friends. I fully expected them to against the Miami Dolphins, but putting nearly 30 on the board against the Denver Broncos defense is a feat. I don’t love the Tennessee offense, but even a minimal contribution from them should push this final total Over 43.5. If sports book thinks that the Titans keep this game somewhere in the ball park of +5.0 to a team that regularly puts up 25+, my money’s on this encounter to see at least 44.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

My business was steady but just not covering everything, debts felt like shackles, worry was a constant companion. One evening I sat at the kitchen table, asking God “Isn’t there some breakthrough?” That night, I turned to prayer in a new way—five different areas, asking God in faith, speaking words of trust and aligning what I believed with what His Word says. Slowly, *slowly*, I saw changes: new clients, a budget that worked, peace replacing fear.

If you want a **financial breakthrough**, these five prayers in different key areas may help you pray with clarity, faith, and purpose. You can use one, all five, or adapt them. What matters is your *heart*, *trust*, and *faith in God*.

[**SUBSCRIBE to my Prayer YouTube Channel (1M+ SUBS) and you'll find over 3700+ prayers that will bless and strengthen you.**](https://www.youtube.com/c/DailyEffectivePrayer?sub_confirmation=1)

# 1. Praying for Provision

Many financial struggles come because of lack—lack of job, income, or basic needs. When I was in that kitchen that night, I started here: praying for *provision*.

**Prayer for Provision Example**  
Heavenly Father, You are **Jehovah Jireh**, my Provider. I thank You that according to Your riches in glory in Christ Jesus, You will *meet all my needs*. (Phil 4:19) Lord, I declare that I trust You for what I *cannot see yet*. Provide steady work or extra income, meet my family’s needs, open Your hand in times of scarcity. May I lean not on my own understanding but depend wholly on You. In Jesus Name. Amen.

Provision matters because when finances are tight, **fear and anxiety** choke the spirit. Asking God for provision shifts the battle from your striving to His sufficiency. Scripture reminds us that God supplies, God feeds, God opens storehouses. We are not abandoned.

# 2. Praying for Wisdom & Stewardship

It’s one thing to ask God for more. It’s another to use well what you already have. I’ve messed this part up more than once—trying to spend more money before learning how to steward what I had. The result was just more lack.

**Prayer for Wisdom & Stewardship Example**  
Lord God, grant me wisdom to budget well, to see where I waste, and to steward what You’ve already given me. Give me discipline with spending, generosity with giving, faithful in little so You can entrust me with much. Help me see money as *servant*, not master. In You I trust. Amen.

Financial breakthrough isn’t just about receiving, but being faithful with what God has given. Stewardship includes not just money, but time, talents, opportunities. I once committed to tracking every expense for a month—turns out I was spending small amounts daily (coffee, apps, little buys) that added up. When I saw the pattern, God gave me creativity to cut back and redirected that money to savings and giving.

# 3. Praying to Release Debt & Burdens

Debt is more than financial—it’s emotional, spiritual. It can rob peace, rob sleep. I remember feeling guilty, ashamed, wondering if I’d blown God’s chances to bless me. But Jesus meets us in our mess, not our perfection.

**Prayer to Release Debt & Burdens Example**  
Father, I bring before You every debt, burden, worry pressing on me. I repent of missteps, poor decisions—please forgive me in Jesus’ name. I ask You to break the chains of debt over my life. I believe You can open miraculous ways to reduce, release, resolve owing. Help me trust You for grace, even when I see no logical way. Amen.

Having debt doesn’t mean you’ve failed—it means you’re trusting God for rescue. It may not all vanish at once. I experienced gradual release: paying off one debt, then another. Sometimes God used side-jobs or unexpected gifts. Sometimes He used my own choices to change. Practical steps (contacting creditors, budgeting, sometimes getting professional help) must go alongside prayer. Faith without works is dead.

# 4. Praying for Open Doors & Opportunity

Asking God to break open doors—jobs, promotions, investments, business, ministry opportunities—is something I’ve seen work. But often I felt stuck until I began *expecting* doors.

**Prayer for Open Doors & Opportunity Example**  
Heavenly Father, You are Waymaker. I pray that You open the doors I cannot open. Guide me to opportunities that honor You. Let the right connections, the right timing, the right favor come—doors that align with Your will, not just my desires. Help me to recognize them and walk through. In Your name I trust. In Jesus Name, amen.

A friend of mine was laid off and discouraged. She prayed specifically for one door: something that would let her use her skills AND give her enough to pay rent. She updated her resume, reached out to old colleagues, and one of them referred her to a job she never expected. That job turned into a steady income stream. But sometimes doors feel closed. That’s okay. Sometimes God’s open door is patience, or growth, or character building.

# 5. Praying for Peace & Trust in the Process

This area often gets overlooked. We pray for provision, for open doors, for debt to fall—but we forget to pray for *peace while waiting*. Trusting God in the delay is as powerful as praying for breakthrough itself.

**Prayer for Peace & Trust Example**  
Father, in seasons when finances lag, when bills crowd in, help me to rest in You. Teach me to trust Your timing. Calm my heart. Shift my gaze from what I *feel* I lack to who You are. Give me joy in the waiting, hope when I cannot see the way, faith that You are working behind the scenes. In Jesus’ name. Amen.

Many breakdowns—physical, emotional, spiritual—come from anxiety, not just lack. Scripture reminds us: *“My peace I give to you”* (John 14:27), *“Be still and know that I am God”* (Psalm 46:10). During one lean season I prayed for provision, for open doors, for momentum—and nothing seemed to change. But as I prayed for peace, God changed *me*. I felt lighter, less driven by fear, more patient. And eventually, provision came.

# Bringing it All Together: Your Daily Prayer Rhythm

These five prayers are powerful. But they become transformative when woven into your **daily prayer life**. Just as muscles grow through repeated workouts, faith grows through repeated prayers, spoken truths, declarations, trust.

Here are some practical ways to make these prayers part of *your life*:

1. **Daily Morning Hour (or Quarter-hour):** Begin each day with at least one of the above prayers. Rotating through them helps.
2. **Scripture + Declaration:** Pair your prayer with a Bible verse that supports it. For instance: *Philippians 4:19* for provision, *James 1:5* for wisdom. Use them also as declarations throughout the day.
3. **Journaling Progress:** Write down what you asked God for, what you believe, what you see changing—even small things. This builds *faith muscle*.
4. **Community & Accountability:** Share with someone you trust—mentor, friend, pastor—what you are praying for. Pray together, encourage each other.
5. **Act Faithfully:** Prayer opens doors... your actions walk through them. Budget, steward, seek, give—when God gives ideas, act.

# Reflection: What I’ve Learned & What You Might Learn

Waiting is not wasted. God’s timing may feel slow, but often that time cultivates character, clarity, dependence on Him. Faith isn’t magic... it’s trust. And sometimes trust looks like doing small, faithful things while believing for the big. I learned that God is more concerned with *who I am becoming* than just *what I have*. When He changes my heart—makes me generous, humble, wise—breakthroughs tend to follow. Sometimes breakthrough comes through difficulty, not always at the moment of asking. And that’s okay. God works in seasons.

# Call to Action

So, what might God be asking *you* to pray today? Which of the five areas resonates most—provision, wisdom, debt release, opportunity, or peace? Maybe more than one.

Here’s something I invite you to do:

* Pick one prayer (or two) from above. Pray it *daily* for the next 7 days.
* After 7 days, sit down and journal what you believe God has done—even the unseen things: your heart, your decisions, the small shifts.
* Share with someone you trust about it—pray together.
* Visit my YouTube channel, choose a relevant prayer, and let me pray for you.

You don’t have to have it all figured out. You don’t have to see everything today. But when you partner with **God**, with **faith**, with **trust**, you position yourself for a breakthrough that’s more than financial—it reaches into your soul. I believe God has something good for you. Let’s trust Him for it, walk with Him through every step, and watch what He does.

1nmvex2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmvex2,Cafés da semana (21/09),"Boa tarde, pessoal!

Essa semana, retirei meus cafés da Dora Coffee Roasters, torrefação da minha cidade. Foram torrados dia 15/09 (é o informado pelo menos) e retirei nesse mesmo dia. 

O Caramelo Salgado e o Mel e Amêndoa têm como intuito, acredito, de serem cafés do dia a dia. Assim os uso/usarei. Já o torta de limão, acredito que seja mais exótico e o grão tem origem da fazenda do dono da Dora, processado exclusivamente através do Terroir-based Organic Activation (TROA). Ao meu entendimento (e divulgado por eles), os grãos são fermentados com micro-organismos da região.

Mel e amêndoas
Foi o primeiro a ser aberto e consumido ao longo dessa semana toda (pacote tá acabando já, pessoal é violento aqui).
Receitas:
V60: R3 click 60, 1:15 (20 g pra 300 ml), água Hidrattas Fonte Serra Negra (dureza 25,14 ppm e alcalinadade 37,26 ppm). 3 despejos: bloom de 1 minuto 60 g baixa agitação, 2o 60 g baixa agitação e 3o 60 g despejo único. Passa em 3min~3min10s
Sensorial: amêndoas. Ponto final. Muito doce, acidez bem tranquila. Redondo.
Mesmo com o descanso quase nulo, apresentou-se como um café muito doce, com acidez de fato bem moderada. O cheiro de amêndoas é bizarramente pronunciado.

Prensa francesa: R3 click 100 ou 110 (realmente não me lembro e queria lembrar 🥲), 1:15 (20 g pra 300 ml), mesma água. Receitando Hoffman.
Sensorial: acerola e pitanga ABSURDAMENTE pronunciadas. Sério, chocante. Minha mãe que tem um sensorial ainda limitadíssimo conseguiu identificar essas mesmas coisas sem eu dizer nada. Tudo isso na prensa francesa vagabonds que tenho. Tô tentando repetir, mas não lembro a moagem mesmo 🫠

Caramelo salgado
Foi aberto dia 19/09, pouquíssimo descanso também. 
Receitas: 
V60 mesma do anterior (essa é minha receita ""start point"", a partir dela vou ajustando).
Sensorial: caramelo salgado bem legal (já havia provado na cafeteria Lorem Ipsum, aqui da minha cidade tbm, fica a dica), e nota-se acerola e pitanga bem encondidas, mas dá pra notar. Acho que mais uns dias de descanso elas surgirão (espero eu rsrs).
Apresentou-se bem doce e a acidez um pouco mais pronunciada. Cheiro dos grãos levemente frutado.

Prensa francesa: meio flat. Talvez eu tenha criado as expectativas que nem foi com o outro, mas pode ser que precise de mais descanso.

Torta de limão
Esse aqui eu abri hoje (21/09), e abri já sabendo que precisaria de descanso.
Receita minha padrão do V60.
Sensorial: de fato, torta de limão. Peguei como comparação o Limão Cello da Garagem do Café e, por enquanto, é uma torta de limão bem light, levinha, gostosinha. Acho que descansando mais, pode atingir um potencial incrível. A do Garagem eu achei forte até demais, mas acredito que seja o forte de cafés fermentados, o que não me agrada muito/não estou muito acostumado.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Tbh, i just use the lure of sex to keep him interested. I just feel like I'm boring. I want a boyfriend so bad but im not worth it cause i have no life.  I have been struggling with ptsd and bipolar and currently have no job because of it, and I also dropped out of college temporarily. I have no money but money my parents lend me. im planning on giving plasma donations so at least ill have my own money soon and offer something that might save someones life. I used to do hobbies like martial arts, concert going, skateboarding, record collecting and hiking. I play videogames but not online games i can play with other people. I used to smoke weed now i dont, and i used to drink now i cant temporarily cause of meds. I listen to music that is kind of obscure and unrelatable like punk, goth, metal.

Now the only hobbies I really have left are record collecting and hiking left. i am going back to martial arts and skating, but im getting physical therapy for skating first and need to save money for a new skateboard so i cant do that. I also do sexy femboy dressup stuff.I feel like all im good for is sending horny videos of myself to keep guys interested, it's the only thing that keeps the chemistry going really. the only thing interesting about me is that i like to wear cute costumes and langere, which is unique for a boy and hard to actually find off of internet porn. i want to start skating again but a new boyfriend isn't gonna want to do that with me, or want to go to my concerts, and what's the point going on a hike or grabbing coffee with someone, if you aren't going to have anything to talk about, because the person you're hiking with has no hobbies, job, or life. I have no real friends too, only ones far away that i text with, but am not even close with to the point of having any real conversations, just a group chat and plans to hang out. I want to become an architectural historian or anthropologist, or something of that nature, but im not currently enrolled in school again yet. i missed the mark for this semester cause i just got home a few weeks ago from mental health treatment.

I'm just starting my life again, coming home from two months in treatment split between therapy and rehab because i had severe ptsd from sexual assault. That means i just re-entered life, from scratch..  ive basically spent the last almost two years of my life drinking and drugging since it happened to kill the pain, degenerating and rotting to the point there's nothing left of what used to be my life. all i want is a life back, a boy who's actually interested in me, but im just not worth it, no one would have chemistry with me, im an absolute nothing.",1,1758469592.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1nmvaid,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nmvaid/why_are_headphones_ideal_for_office_environments/,Why are headphones ideal for office environments?,"Hey everyone! I've been working in various office settings for over a decade now, and I wanted to share my experience with using headphones at work. Trust me, they've been absolute lifesavers!

Let me tell you why I think headphones are essential for any office worker. First off, they help create this personal bubble of focus in what can often be a chaotic environment. You know those days when your coworker won't stop talking about their weekend plans, or when the sales team is having another loud celebration? Yeah, that's when headphones become your best friend.

I recently got myself a new pair of noise-canceling headphones (you can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/headphones), and they've completely transformed my workday. The ability to block out unwanted noise has boosted my productivity significantly. I'm talking about getting through complex spreadsheets without losing focus every five minutes.

But it's not just about blocking noise. Wearing headphones in the office has become this universal ""do not disturb"" sign. When I have them on, my colleagues know I'm in the zone and prefer not to be interrupted unless it's urgent. It's like this unspoken office etiquette that everyone seems to understand.

I've also noticed that listening to the right type of music or white noise through headphones helps me maintain a steady work rhythm. Sometimes I go for instrumental music, other times nature sounds - whatever helps me stay focused without being distracting.

For those interested in upgrading their office gear, I highly recommend checking out some quality noise-canceling options (https://athometouch.com/headphones). The investment really pays off in terms of concentration and productivity.

Another huge benefit is the ability to take calls without disturbing others. With more teams going hybrid and virtual meetings becoming the norm, having good headphones with a clear microphone is crucial. No more echoes or feedback during those important client calls!

Here's a pro tip: if you're planning to use headphones at work, consider getting a pair with comfortable ear cushions. Trust me, you'll thank me later when you're wearing them for several hours straight.

Speaking of comfort, wireless headphones are a game-changer. No more getting tangled in cords when you reach for your coffee or stand up to grab something from the printer. Just remember to charge them regularly - learned that one the hard way!

Bottom line: if you want to stay productive in today's open-office environments, a good pair of headphones isn't just nice to have - it's essential. They help maintain focus, manage noise levels, and handle communications smoothly. Plus, they're a lot cheaper than requesting a private office!

I’ve been transcribing and organizing everything using AI and asked for a summary, because this would be much longer without it, so if it looks AI-ish below, that’s why.

I’m in Texas (Parker County). Married with kids. Things have been bad for years, but recently it’s escalated and I don’t know what to do next.

Background
	•	My wife constantly insults me (loser, not a man, etc.), mocks me in public and private, and ridicules me in front of the kids.
	•	She pressures me to admit to things I didn’t say/do, and uses those “admissions” to absolve herself while never apologizing for her own actions.
	•	She controls all the money. I have debt and no savings. She has about $50–60k in her own account. She’s refused to open a joint account since we married.

Recent incidents (all documented on audio/photos):
	•	Driving incident: She hit me in the head/face with a metal coffee thermos while I was driving and threw coffee on me, nearly causing a wreck. All while the kids were in the car with us. On audio she contradicts herself repeatedly: first says she didn’t hit me, then says it was my arm, then says it was self-defense, then says I “deserved it.”
	•	Threats: She said outright, “If you call me a name, I’ll hit you every time.” She’s also told me to “sleep with one eye open.”
	•	Phone incident: She took my phone and threw it in a parking lot. When I called her out in public, she told our daughter she’d never take her to soccer again and told me if the kids want sports, it’s only on me.
	•	Kids: On audio, my daughter begged her to stop yelling and said “you’re both bad guys.” I admitted in front of my daughter that I could do better. My wife refused to take any responsibility.
	•	Money: On audio, she says she’ll freeze her money in a Canadian account so I can’t access it, and that I’ll never afford a lawyer. She also threatened to use her influence at work to have her boss rescind a job offer she arranged for me.

Work situation
	•	I stopped working under her suggestion, with the understanding she’d cover things while I found a new job.
	•	She discouraged me from a couple of jobs I found myself.
	•	She got me a job through her employer, but now threatens to get it pulled if I don’t do what she says.

My concerns
	•	I have no money and can’t afford a lawyer upfront.
	•	She has threatened to lie to police and claim self-defense if I report her.
	•	She’s also threatened to use old video of me spanking my son (2–3 years ago, no injury) to accuse me of child abuse if I push back.
	•	The kids are being emotionally dragged into this and punished for conflicts between us.

Evidence I have
	•	Audio recordings (her threats, contradictions, insults, financial threats, bad-mouthing me to kids).
	•	Photos (scratch, bent sunglasses, coffee stains).
	•	Notes of incidents.

My questions
	1.	In Texas, if one spouse has all the money, how do I even get a lawyer? Will the court make her pay fees?
	2.	What happens if she calls police first and lies? Do my recordings protect me?
	3.	Does the inheritance money she got (from Canada) count as hers alone, or is any of it community property. She specifically told me to quit my job for the summer and she would use that money to support us. She has discouraged me from taking certain jobs then found me a job at her company and I wouldn’t work at her location and now she’s threatening to have her boss rescind the offer.
	4.	Can a court do anything about her threatening to sabotage my job offer?
	5.	Should I file a police report now just to have a record, even if I don’t press charges yet?

I’m scared she’s going to use money and false accusations to destroy me. I want to protect myself and my kids, but I have no idea what steps I can afford right now. Any advice is appreciated.",4,1758469271.0,legaladvice,5,0.83,False
1nmv957,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1nmv957/crazy_cpu_upgrade_experience_getting_it_to_post/,Crazy CPU upgrade experience getting it to post. Always amazes me what can go wrong and how lucky you are when you get it working. (Story),"I upgraded from a Ryzen 5 3600 to a Ryzen 7 5800xt last night.

I should just be able to do the swap, reset cmos, and reboot, right?

Here's how 3 hours of my time were spent trying to get it to post:

* Every time I had to reset cmos, I had to remove my large RTX 5070 GPU from my cramped case, short the cmos pins, and then painstaking add the GPU back into it's slot so that I could see if there was display output when I rebooted. Keep this in mind every time I have to clear cmos.
   * Man, this is annoying and made me envy people who use the pcie extension cable so they don't have to keep reslotting it. An integrated graphics cpu would have also made this nice since you can just keep the monitor plugged into the mobo until things are posting.
* I pre-upgraded my mobo's bios firmware beforehand and ensured that the updated mobo would post with the 3600 before I did the swap.
   * I tried Q-Flash Plus first since Plus must mean Better (didn't even look up what normal Q-Flash was). But because the only USB stick I had was an ancient one from uni 20 years ago with a Sandisk U3 partition, the mobo couldn't find the file even after I used a sketchy u3remove.exe I found online.
   * When Q-Flash Plus doesn't work btw, which means you press the Q-Flash Plus button and nothing happens, the mobo enters a bad state and you have to clear cmos. You'd think there would at least be ""if no file then do nothing"" logic but nah.
   * Then I realize that my bios has normal Q-Flash which is so much  better if your system is already posting: you can upgrade the bios through a nice UI with a progress bar! I had to buy a $5 usb stick from Microcenter at 8pm just to do this. yay.
* Swapping the CPU itself is never a quick operation somehow even though it's mechanically simple, especially in a cramped case.
   * And then cleaning thermal paste off the cooler really just means transferring it to your fingers and then between your fingers forever. You don't have a microfiber cloth btw so you're using coffee filters since that's what google said when you googled the next best thing.
   * And then the thermal paste you have, the one from 5 years ago from your first PC build, runs out while you're doing a practice run because the plunger doesn't actually go all the way down when it's empty so you run out prematurely. So now you're going through old boxes in storage to find the thermal paste your remember coming with your Noctua cpu cooler 5 years ago.
* Things just would NOT post, and USB peripheral lights weren't coming on. So I tried random things like seating just one stick of ram. But all the cmos resets were killing me, so I swapped out my RTX 5070 for my tiny 1650 Super I had laying around just because then I could reset cmos without unseating the gpu.
   * Turns out that this was a critical step in getting it to post. Not sure how I would have gotten this to work if I didn't still have that old gpu. o\_O (Explained below)
* Turns out that shorting the cmos pins for 30 seconds wasn't enough. In a desperate attempt I shorted that sucker for like 2 minutes. This was my hail mary before reseating the cpu which I did NOT want to do. some people might say ""just unplug the battery"" but the battery pin is beneath my cpu cooler and I'm not gonna take that sucker off just to clear cmos unless it's the last thing I do.
* Whoa, now the PC boots to an American Megatrends logo screen and hangs there. I gave it 10min. I google it and I find a reddit thread where people are sharing their superstitions about how to get past it. You press F1. No, actually it's asking you a question but you just can't see it, so be sure to press Y for Yes. No, you want to press N for No. ...Well, it turns out btw you just press any key and it doesn't matter. But imagine arriving on this screen if you didn't have a keyboard.
* NOW the PC posts with the 1650 Super in it, so now I can just swap back to the 5070 and it will work right?
   * Nah, won't post anymore. Same symptoms as before I swapped out the GPU. Of course, I reset the cmos a couple times. I probably removed and added my 5070 20 times during all this. 30min spent total just reseating the thing.
   * At this point I ask ChatGPT because I don't even know wtf to google for and I write pretty much all of this out to it so it has the perfect context for what could be wrong. It tells me to switch PCEIX16 Slot Configuration in the bios from ""Auto"" to ""Gen3"" since the auto-negotiation is failing somehow.
   * Wow, \*that\* was it?!
* Sure enough, it posts now.

Big thanks to random reddit threads just like this from 5 years ago helping me figure out what to try next in my troubleshooting list, so this is an attempt to pay it forward even if it's just for google.

The aftermath:

As for what kind of perf upgrade I'm feeling post-upgrade, the 3600 was a great chip I bought f or $65 in its hey day and I could have just waited it out until a whole mobo slot upgrade. But at 1440p, in a game like The Finals, CPU game logic frametime went from 11ms to 5-6ms. (Gpu frame time was 4ms). In other words, CPU was bottlenecking the GPU to 70-100fps, and after the upgrade I was seeing more stable 100-120fps in the game I'm playing the most lately.

In Darktide, similar avg FPS as before, but so much better 0.1% lows fps that it removed all stuttering that would crop up during intense fights.",1,1758469271.0,buildapc,1,0.67,False

**Influencer A:** ""I spend 12 hours a week creating content and make like $300 a month.""

**Influencer B:** ""Same! I have all these followers but can't convert them to anything.""

I wanted to shake them both and scream: **""YOU'RE TREATING EACH PLATFORM LIKE A SEPARATE BUSINESS!""**

Here's what they were doing wrong (and what 90% of creators do):

They'd create a YouTube video, then frantically try to ""adapt"" it for Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter. But their ""adaptation"" was just chopping up the same content and hoping for the best.

**The result?** Each platform got watered-down, generic content that didn't connect with anyone.

**It's like trying to wear the same outfit to a job interview, a nightclub, and a funeral.** Technically it's clothes, but it's wrong for every situation.

Each platform has its own vibe, its own unspoken rules, its own way of rewarding creators:

* **LinkedIn rewards authority and professional insights**
* **TikTok rewards entertainment and trends**
* **Twitter rewards hot takes and quick wit**
* **Reddit rewards authenticity and community value**

**But here's the million-dollar insight I wanted to tell them:**

The most successful creators aren't creating more content. They're creating the SAME content in different languages.

One core idea becomes:

* A LinkedIn article about industry insights
* A TikTok trend participation
* A Twitter controversy thread
* A Reddit storytelling post

**Same brain, different voices.**

After watching these creators struggle, I got obsessed with solving this problem. I spent months building a system that takes any video content and translates it into each platform's native language.

**The results in my own testing:**

* Same time investment as before
* 6x the reach across platforms
* Actually making money instead of just getting views
* Each platform feels authentic, not recycled

**Those Starbucks creators are still making $300/month because they're speaking English in six different countries.**

Jeff, Colette, and I (you might know us from Comics Place) picked up the Bellingham ComiCon mantle, and are moving the event downtown on October 25. There’s not a single Bellingham venue big enough to host this, so we figured “heck it,” let’s turn downtown into our convention center. 

We have some major comic creators already booked, and will be announcing our vendor list in the next few days. 

It’s an all-ages, all-day event spanning two downtown venues (the Hotel Leo ballroom and the Chuckanut Distillery Ballroom [which is GORGEOUS]), and featuring nerdy specials at other downtown businesses, we plan to grow the party in the coming years. So help us kick off Year One of Pacific NerdWest!

1nmv44b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1nmv44b/explore_if_the_best_electric_kettle_zojirushi/,Explore if the Best Electric Kettle Zojirushi Delivers on Comfort,"Compact, sleek, and surprisingly efficient, the Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH water boiler and warmer quickly found a place in my daily routine. The stainless gray finish fits seamlessly in my kitchen, matching the modern appliances around it. With its precise micro computerized temperature control system, this boiler does more than just heat water—it ensures water is at exactly the right temperature, whether I’m brewing tea, making instant noodles, or filling a hot water bottle. At a sturdy 135-ounce capacity, it saves me repeated refills, a major plus for frequent hot water users like me.

**Merits**

Incorporating this water boiler into my day was surprisingly natural.  
- The four keep-warm temperature settings—160, 175, 195, and 208 degrees Fahrenheit—are intelligently designed for various uses, whether it’s green tea, coffee, or boiling hot water.  
- The quick temp mode caught my eye as it heats water directly to the desired temperature without going through the boiling stage, saving time when I’m in a rush.  
- Its swivel base makes pouring an effortless task, especially during family dinners or when passing the boiler around at gatherings.  
- Let’s not forget the energy-saving timer function that allows scheduling hot water availability for up to 10 hours, optimizing electricity usage.

[Check Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b07cb98837/)  

**Features Woven with Daily Convenience**  

The detachable lid is a subtle yet highly practical touch, making it so much easier to clean and refill. All surfaces in contact with water are BPA-free, ensuring safety—a particularly heartening detail for someone health-conscious like me. The rust-resistant stainless steel interior and clear-coated exterior, on the other hand, make maintenance a breeze. While I initially thought sound indicators might be unnecessary, they’ve actually come in handy, particularly the low water alerts, sparing me from mid-recipe mishaps when the boiler runs empty.  

**One Unexpected Weakness**  

Despite the stellar performance, there’s one area where this product might disappoint some users.  
- Its larger size might pose a challenge for smaller kitchens or countertop spaces. While the swivel base helps maneuvering, not all apartments or compact kitchens have enough space to comfortably house a device of this size.  
- Another minor drawback is the lack of an automatic shut-off feature after prolonged inactivity, especially for those of us who forgetful or distracted by multi-tasking.  
- Though not a deal-breaker, the price tag might feel steep compared to basic kettles, even with the additional utility this product brings to the table.  

**Competing Products**  

When comparing the Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH to alternatives in the water boiler category, the Tiger PDU-A50U-K model frequently comes up as a close contender. Both devices offer similar temperature precision and energy-saving features, though the Tiger model provides an automatic lock mechanism that ensures added safety in households with children. That being said, Zojirushi’s rust-resistant interior feels like a clear winner for long-term durability, particularly in humid kitchen environments. Meanwhile, basic electric kettles, like the Cuisinart CPK-17, are priced lower but lack the high-capacity design and multi-temperature control, offering a more simplified tool meant primarily for quick boiling tasks.  

**Value for Money**  

While admittedly more expensive than a standard electric kettle, the Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH delivers cost-efficiency over time. Its reliable durability, time-saving features, and ability to fine-tune water temperature make it ideal for daily use in a household or small office setting. The energy-saving options, coupled with a high level of customization, ensure you’re not just paying for a device but for consistent convenience in the long run. If you’re someone who relies heavily on hot water not only for drinks but cooking and other tasks, the investment starts to make even more sense.

The kind of pain that made you walk slower, talk slicker, and drink darker. Her name was Cora, but folks on the block called her “Suzette,” because everything about her was smooth except her past.

Suzette had once been the kind of woman who made men forget their mothers and women remember their fathers. But that was before him. Before the boy with the crooked smile and a heart like a locked liquor cabinet—sweet, dangerous, and never fully open.

His name was Jax. He didn’t break her heart. He dissolved it. Like sugar in black coffee—slow, bitter, and irreversible.

They met in a laundromat on Lenox Avenue, her folding sheets like she was preparing for war, him leaning against the dryer like he was waiting for a prophecy. He said she looked like a jazz song. She said he looked like trouble. They were both right.

For a while, they were gospel. Sunday morning love with Saturday night sins. He’d write poems on her thighs with his fingertips, and she’d hum melodies into his collarbone. But love like that don’t last. Not in a city where dreams get evicted and loyalty’s just another lease agreement.

He left her for a girl who wore pink like it was armor. A girl who didn’t know how to cry without checking her reflection. Suzette didn’t beg. She didn’t plead. She just went back to black.

Black lipstick. Black nails. Black coffee. Black thoughts.

She started haunting jazz clubs like a ghost with a cover charge. Her voice—smoky, cracked, and divine—wrapped around the mic like it was the last man who’d never leave her. She sang about betrayal like it was a birthright. About love like it was a crime scene. Every note was a confession. Every lyric, a wound.

Carvin was the first to notice. He ran the club, “The Pulse,” a dim-lit sanctuary for broken geniuses and half-sober prophets. Carvin had seen pain before. He’d seen it in the eyes of sax players who lost their sons to sirens, in the hands of pianists who played through arthritis and regret. But Suzette? She was different. Her pain had rhythm.

Lye, the club’s resident poet and part-time bartender, started writing about her. Not in journals, but on napkins, receipts, cigarette packs. Lye wrote about the way Suzette’s voice made the liquor taste like forgiveness. About how her silence screamed louder than her songs. Lye knew stories. Suzette was one.

One night, after a set that left the crowd breathless and the walls sweating, Suzette sat at the bar, swirling bourbon like it was a memory. Lye slid a napkin toward her. On it, scribbled in ink and ache:

“You don’t sing songs. You summon ghosts.”

Suzette read it, smiled without joy, and said, “I got a whole cemetery in my chest.”

Carvin poured her another. “You ever gonna write about him?”

She looked up, eyes lined with charcoal and history. “I already did. Every time I open my mouth.”

Outside, the city kept moving. Sirens wailed like backup singers. Lovers argued like bad duets. But inside The Pulse, Suzette sang. And when she did, the room turned sepia. Time slowed. And even Jax, wherever he was, probably felt it. That ache. That echo. That velvet vengeance.

Because some women don’t cry when they’re left.
They compose.
They perform.
They resurrect.

And Suzette?
She didn’t go back to him.
She went back to black.
And black never left her.

I just got to work, took a sip from my coffee, and opened up my MacBook Air M4 13-inch. Prior to my recently purchased MacBook, I had never had a Mac–I had always avoided buying one due to my lack of knowledge on the platform. That being said, I took a change on Friday and bought myself my first ever Mac. 

Overall, the experience has been a very new and almost alien experience; the computer is all metal, definitely well made, and a complete detour from other computers I've had like, HP, Lenovo, and Acer. That said, I'm completely in love with the platform. It's got a great camera, smooth trackpad functions, the integration with my other devices is beyond what I expected, and its performance is great for the price (with some discounts, I got it from Apple for $899 with a free magic keyboard)

Aside from the Magic Keyboard, I'd like to better complement my Mac with some useful programs, apps, and accessories to maximize my experience. So far, I purchased a mat for my keys to protect them from my stick fingers, a privacy screen protector (one of the magnetic removable ones, a flash drive for a more on-the-go external drive, and a carry case.

I've seen some YouTube videos which have been very great in recommending applications, and created helped in learning all the settings. With this, what are some personal tips and tricks that were game changers for you? I'm trying to really maximize my experience.",9,1758468451.0,apple,3,0.91,False

My daughter and I also have curly hair so we chatted a bit about the learning curve of different curl types.

I am expecting who gets these they keep them as.decorations.

I made marble cupcakes with coffee in the chocolate part, and buttercream with crisco in it, and black cocoa.

And sprayed them with red candy spray.

The toppers made the lid not big enough so I loosely taped it on.

I don’t doubt it’s been tough but she annoys me with it because more than once she’s implied I’ve got an easy life because i live with my kid’s dad and he shares the responsibilities with me. 

At least once a week she says she “forgot to bring lunch” or says she didn’t plan well so didn’t bring enough food and talks about how hungry she is throughout the day until people offer her food from their lunches or stashes. 

At first I thought she was just saying this to me so I would discretely give her bits from my own lunch box because I usually pack extra anyway just in case. Then I witnessed her do it with other people. There’s about three other people I know of who regularly give her food from their lunch. She never pays it back or offers out anything from her own stuff, just takes from everyone but I thought maybe she’s genuinely poor and can’t afford food so I continued to give her things.

As I got to know her over the months though I realised she’s not as poor as she makes out. In the last 6 months she’s been on a holiday abroad, bought an expensive kitchen appliance she didn’t need (she already had one, she just wanted the newer one with more functions), bought a whole new wardrobe (not second hand) and is buying a new to her car (to make her a two-car house when she’s the only driver). She also made a big deal about how much she spends on Christmas presents for her family. She has money, she just spend it on luxuries instead of necessities.

Today I found out (from her) that another co-worker has added her to their family subscription for a streaming service. Everyone else is buying her “poor me” act. This woman isn’t rich but she’s certainly not too-poor-to-buy-food poor. 

So i’ve stopped giving her my stuff. She’s started being very blatant about it these days. When I brought some extra drinks to see me through the week and put them in the shared fridge, she went to the fridge then she spent the next half hour talking about how thirsty she is… we get bottled water for free and have a fully stocked tea/coffee bar. 

We’ll be sat at the lunch table, I’ve finished everything but a chocolate biscuit and she’ll say things like, “I wish I’d brought some chocolate today to top off my lunch, I could really do with the energy”. I’ve stopped responding. Now I just pack my lunch box away, chocolate biscuit and all as if I haven’t heard her.

1nmugqw,https://i.redd.it/f6pu90ncajqf1.jpeg,Eternal Sunshine and the narcissist’s prayer | part II,"**The Boy is Mine**

*How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic*

I would love to break down each line of the song as each is revealing on its own but I think this part sums up the utter lack of self-awareness and accountability that Ariana has and her fans enable. I don’t think anyone in their right mind would call a relationship with a  married man and father ‘meant to be’. As it’s the one and only topic of the 13 tracks on this album, I don’t really know what to say anymore. She obsessively wanted to shove her narrative into everyone’s throat so bad with ES and she got validated by many people which is what she ultimately wanted. Also, destroying a family and the happiness of a loving wife and a baby and calling it ‘a scene’ is beyond disgusting. And no Ariana, you’re not ‘usually unproblematic’. In fact, you’ve done it before but you’re only getting caught now. She only implicitly admits she is ‘problematic’ not because she regrets anything but solely because she got backlash which is devastating for a narcissist. Also, the way she sings this part almost in a playful tone is wild. 

**Yes, and?**

*Don't comment on my body, do not reply
Your business is yours and mine is mine
Why do you care so much whose - I ride?*

‘That didn’t happen and if it did it wasn’t that bad’. She’s essentially saying her body is perfectly healthy and shouldn’t raise concerns — diminishing genuine worries into simple ‘snarky’ comments. Acting like her fan base aren’t mostly young girls which we know is the demographic that is the most affected by ED. If she wasn’t purposefully showing her collarbone any given chance and bragging about only eating black coffee and cucumbers maybe it wouldn’t be so bad but she knows she is a role model to many young fans too. This is showing lack of empathy to her actual fans and remorse. Love how she uses the generic vocabulary of a narcissist too throughout the whole song ‘Now I’m so done with caring’ … Ok monster ? ‘[…]Underneath your own projections’, text-book gaslight.

**We can’t be friends**

*You got me misunderstood
But at least I look this good*

While I don’t believe this song was mainly intended to be about the homewrecking again unlike all the previous songs so far — wild — we can’t ignore these lines. I’m pretty sure the double meaning of being ‘misunderstood’ by her partner in that song is a way to victimize herself and gaslight the public into thinking she’s generally misunderstood and we don’t know the full story — which she never gave us by the way. Also, saying she looks ‘this good’ while she’s skeleton-like and botched. Babe you’re chopped. 

**I wish I hated you**

Just an unlistenable song. Lyric wise I don’t know what the f she’s talking about here. Trying a bit too hard to sound angelic too for a serial cheater, homewrecker and liar but ok.

**Imperfect for you**

*Mm, how could we know
We'd make the bad stuff delightful? Mm*

Here she is saying that shit with her chest. People suffering from NPD gain pleasure from ‘winning’ over people and most importantly, controlling the socially accepted narrative. She’s done something bad — again — and got away with it which is a win to people like her.

Again, I told him that I’m setting a boundary and told him to only message her at work about work-related things. Again, he apologized and said that he would do that.

I want to add that when he is at work, he never messages me, and he never calls me. I do not hear from him until he is home from work, but he will answer messages while at home. I feel as if he’s taking time from us when he’s staying on his phone about “work”-related things.

My biggest suggestion would be for people to search for answers. Many are there. Recent searches for me; leaky catheter, swollen testicles, pee when poo RALP

Anyway, I had my RALP surgery, with an umbilical hernia fix, on Wednesday. Went home Thursday. Things are going much better than anticipated. 

Day one hospital I just chilled. Still out of it. Enjoyed the shitty food being brought to me by some of the nicest folks in hospitality. 

Car home, went straight to the basement. I do better on a couch when I’m sick, it’s cold and there’s a TV. Plus I could move around a lot without waking my wife. 

I did move quite a bit. Got up randomly in the night or when a meds alarm went off. Walked the basement while watched Golden Girls. 

Weird to say but Golden Girls was a big part of this. Soothing voices plus enough episodes that I could watch, fall asleep and wake and I missed nothing. Great for when you don’t want your brain to work on a new show. 

Day two (first day home): more of the same felt a lot better. Should also add I was on ADT for a month so got some hot flashes. Ate some good/healthy foods. 

Day three: pretty much the same but ate shitty (read as tasty) processed foods and potatoes and such. Had some decaf coffee which I think helped my first poo. Played some pinball. FYIA you can legally use this post to tell your wife that a pinball machine is a medical necessity post RALP. 

Here at day: feeling much better already. Still some pain of course. Moving around. Had regular coffee

But since coming down on the psychiatric medications, I feel less chemically lobotomized.



I often wonder, was there anything even wrong with my brain? Why were they numbing receptors in my brain? 



I almost feel like he was just talking at his ass, just spewing nonsense. ""Oh, we need to numb the receptors in Andrew's brain that are problematic."" 



I feel like some of it was lies and gaslighting from my parents and they were just chemically lobotomizing me. 



I don't know?



But here, look, I got some coffee. The coffee. It's triggering receptors in my brain. It's caffeinating me. It's stimulating my mind. It's giving me energy. It's the F5 receptor, the B12 receptor. It's really triggering that and stimulating that. 



I feel like the psychiatric medications were causing neurological damage and cancer. Though, they say there's no evidence the medications were hurting me. They were doing things to my body. Obviously, numbing the receptors in my brain, but there's no evidence these medications were giving me cancer or neurological damage.



Okay, so at this point, there's going to be no court case where I sue the psychopharmacologist, put my parents in jail for pharmacologically abusing me. 



Ultimately, what I have to do here is if I don't want to take the medications, well, don't take a mega regimen anymore.



It's my responsibility.



They say, well, you're living at your mother's house and she wants you to take medication and she's going to threaten you with homelessness, or the streets, or the psychiatric hospital if you don't take medications. 



All right? 



Take minimal medications so you can live at your mother's house. Don't let them bully you into taking a mega regimen anymore because I don't want to take tons of psychiatric medications.

1nmu5y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nmu5y6/reveal_how_the_best_espresso_machine_breville/,Reveal How the Best Espresso Machine Breville Bambino Plus Performs,"Testing out the Breville Bambino Plus Espresso Machine BES500BSS1BUS1 reminded me of a time I tried making espresso at home with one of those cumbersome, dated machines. Let’s just say my kitchen turned into a caffeine crime scene with coffee grounds scattered like confetti. The Breville Bambino Plus, however, feels like a redemption story in comparison. From the moment I unboxed it, I knew it was about to elevate my coffee game.

**Build Quality and Design**  
Having used several espresso machines over the years, the aesthetic appeal of this coffee maker stood out to me immediately. The brushed stainless steel finish looks modern yet sturdy, blending well with the rest of my kitchen. Given its compact dimensions (7.6 x 12.5 x 12.2 inches), it fits snugly on my countertop without monopolizing the space. As someone who loathes clutter, this was an instant win. The buttons are straightforward and thoughtfully placed—there’s no squinting or fumbling involved during operation. A bonus point for the semi-automatic operation mode, which toes the line between giving you control while also being user-friendly. Slightly heavy at 11 pounds, it gives off this solid, built-to-last vibe, which is comforting considering the price range.

**Functionality and Unique Features**  
I owe the consistently rich espresso shots to its low-pressure pre-infusion feature. The way it gently expands coffee grounds before extraction ensures every cup I make is bursting with flavor. One of the highlights for me is the 54mm porta-filter that holds 19 grams of ground coffee—a game-changer when compared to the skimpier alternatives I’ve tried in other machines of this size. Frothing milk with this machine is a joy, thanks to the automatic microfoam milk texturing. I won’t pretend I’m the Picasso of latte art, but it’s made creating microfoam easier than ever before. My partner tested it too, and even as someone who isn’t typically espresso-savvy, they found it intuitive.

[Check Breville BES500BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b07jvd78tt/)

**Performance**  
The Breville Bambino Plus cuts no corners on performance. Its standout feature for me? The ThermoJet heating system, which heats up in just three seconds. Mornings can be an orchestra of chaos in my household, so speed really counts. There’s no extended wait time, and even on my busiest days, I’m able to pull a satisfying espresso shot in no time. Digital temperature control (PID) ensures that water temperature stays consistent during the brew cycle, allowing flavors to shine rather than burn. Noise levels are minimal, a refreshing change from my older, louder espresso machine that could’ve rivaled a jet engine. That auto-purge feature is another discreet but essential touch—having the system clean itself after steaming is one step less for me to worry about.

**Pluses**  
- Compact size saves counter space yet doesn’t compromise on performance  
- Rapid ThermoJet heating system means espresso is ready in seconds  
- Automatic milk frothing allows effortless texture control for lattes and cappuccinos  
- High-grade, sleek design complements kitchen aesthetics  
- Digital temperature control ensures precise, flavorful extractions  

**Bad Points**  
- The 54mm porta-filter works wonders, but cleaning it can be slightly tedious without the right technique  
- The included tamper feels a bit flimsy; upgrading to a more robust tamper might enhance usability  
- While the machine is semi-automatic, beginners might face a slight learning curve mastering optimal settings  

**Competing Products**  
It’s impossible to review an espresso machine without comparing it to the ever-popular Delonghi Dedica and Gaggia Classic. While both are reputable options, the Breville Bambino Plus truly shines in a few areas. The heating time is leagues ahead of the Dedica, which takes about 40 seconds to preheat—a big difference on busy mornings. The milk frothing system outclasses the Gaggia Classic for its automation and consistency, especially for those who want barista-level froth with minimal effort. The compact design makes it a direct competitor to Delonghi’s slim build, but the Bambino Plus’s sleeker look feels more premium. One aspect where Gaggia excels over Breville would be the sturdiness of its tamper, and it’s worth noting that Gaggia enthusiasts often praise its durability over the years.

**Bang for the Buck**  
As a mid-range espresso machine, this model certainly isn’t aimed at bargain hunters, but its premium features justify the expense. From the auto-purge system to the advanced milk frother, it eliminates the extra steps and hassle that cheaper alternatives tend to overlook. For anyone serious about making high-quality coffee at home, the consistency and flavor are worth the investment. Sure, you could find inexpensive models that still claim to deliver quality espresso, but the added extras here make all the difference.

She was was fairly new, popping onto the scene just 3 years ago and tonight was supposed to be her night off, handing off a mugger to the local police she leaps onto the rooftops once again and simply stops after a bit, gazing at the night sky, she wasn’t supposed to patrol tonight but she needed to stretch her legs tonight, letting off a little steam, a little bit of anger that just 4 or 5 years ago she refused to even admit she felt.

Fuyumi lets a sigh escape her lips, the air frosting a little as it escapes the mask she wears, she had gotten a call today while sorting through her papers, preparing for the new school year, she looks and sees that it’s her father, Shoto’s 21st birthday was tomorrow and they asked her to come, stating that even Natsuo and their little family were gonna be there.

She lets platitudes and excused roll off her tongue like they’ve done a thousand times before, citing the new school year and some random sickness she faked on the spot.
 
Endeavor had become a better father since All Mights retirement, since that battle at Kamino ward seven-ish years ago, most of it was Shoto and Touya’s - Dabi, he said to call him Dabi, that Touya was dead - influence, lord knows endeavor wouldn’t change because of his meek daughter or resentful son, it had to be the successes, the favorites. 

She jumps over rooftops as she reminisces rather bitterly, she remembers running into two homeless children a couple months before Shoto started U.A, deciding to help them on a whim, one dirty green haired teenager who looked like he’d kill for the other rather properly taken care of white haired girl at his side, she remembers all the late nights spent devising plans and backup plans with izuku and she remembers watching it all play out perfectly that night at Kamino ward, with eri by her side on the couch she remembers the sheer relief as she watched izuku show up unannounced at the battle between All for one and the Eighth and in one spectacular second grab All for one’s face, 10 long silent seconds later he was dead, All might stood helpless as he said a few choice words and left as he arrived

She arrives at her apartment at half past three to the sight of izuku, her brother in all but blood making decaffeinated coffee - izuku recognizes and values her regardless of if she puts on a front or not and is thus automatically her second favorite sibling - 
He’s older now with stark white hair and thin jagged gold lines running across his face and body - kintsugi, a legendary regeneration quirk he had acquired, turns put that declaring yourself the new All for one had consequences - 
 
She sits down on the couch across from izuku as he hands her a mug of decaf “dad called yesterday.” Fuyumi utters softly “invited me to shoto’s birthday, even natsuo and his family would be coming he said.” izuku hum’s thoughtfully “you don’t want to go?” fuyumi responds with a clear and concise ‘no’, izuku simply replies “then don’t” 

They finish the rest of their drink in silence and she takes a peek into her favorite sibling room to see eri sleeping safe and sound, she goes back to the living room and sits on the arm chair in the corner, with an alarm set for morning she rests her eyes, she’s gonna be making pancakes in the morning for eri’s first day of middle school after all and she needs all the rest she can get.

1nmturp,https://www.reddit.com/r/backyardultra/comments/1nmturp/greener_miles_cowshed_backyard_ultra_20th/,Greener Miles Cowshed Backyard Ultra - 20th September 2025,"
I made it through 11 yards (46.6 miles, ~2,030m elevation gain, ~5,374 kcal burned) before I pulled the pin. I had hoped to at least reach 12, and I’d set stretch goals of 20 and maybe 24 if the day went well, but the mud and rain turned it into something different altogether.

The running
The first couple of laps were really social – lots of chat and a good atmosphere – then it tailed off into occasional conversation and I actually enjoyed being on my own for stretches. Garmin had me at 42:36 for my fastest loop (10:13/mi) around yard nine, but by the last few I was in the 11:30–12:15/mi range and that meant only 5–6 minutes of rest instead of 10–12. My average HR was 126 bpm and the aerobic training effect came out as 5.0, so it was maximum aerobic stimulus but never anywhere near threshold. The data backs up how it felt – steady early, then a slow grind.
I started in road shoes (laps 1–8) and they were fine until the mud turned into soup. Switched into Gore-Tex trails from yard nine onwards. They gripped better but they’re stiff bricks compared with road shoes, and by then my stride length was down to about 0.9m anyway. Honestly, even 15mm spikes wouldn’t have helped. It was cross country at its sloppiest.


Fuelling and hydration
I actually ate well – around 150–250 calories per lap: chicken and bacon pasta, ham and cheese sandwiches, flapjack. Washed it down with electrolytes, full sugar Coke, and tea. No GI issues at all which I was pleased with. Only caffeine I took was a Bullet at lap eight – should have had one earlier, because the fade had already set in. Sweat loss was around 5.6L across the day, so even with steady sipping there was a big deficit building.


Where it ended
It wasn’t lungs or heart that stopped me. It was glutes that cramped and then tightened until they felt like they’d turned to wood. The day after, they were the sorest thing by far – tells me they’re the weak link. When the bell rang for yard twelve I just couldn’t face going back out. It was a mental collapse as much as physical. The thought of another hour soaked and sliding about was the straw that broke the camel’s back.


Prep this year
I came in decent shape. This year I’ve:
Raced a spring marathon in 2:47 (one gel at 15mi, water at 21 and 23 – classic me)
Run a 34:12 10k and 16:20 5k this summer
Put together steady training blocks of 200–250 miles per month since surgery recovery last autumn
So the base was there. But a Backyard on a wet, hilly field is a different beast to roads.

Organisation
Race organisation was spot on. Good funnel system at the corral, plenty of nutrition if you needed it, hot and cold water on tap, tea and coffee all day. Portaloos and urinals were kept clean. The field was soaked by the end – cars were needing pushes to get out, mine included.

Final thoughts
I’m disappointed with 11 yards. I wanted more. Not sure yet if I’ll do another BYU – the format is brutal. It’s not about speed, it’s about the ability to get up every hour and go again. On the day, I didn’t have that beyond eleven.",2,1758465948.0,backyardultra,0,1.0,False

Episode: “Conference”
FADE IN:
INT. WERNHAM HOGG OFFICE - DAY
The familiar open-plan office. DAVID BRENT sits at his desk, adjusting his tie and checking his hair in a small mirror. The documentary camera focuses on him.
DAVID BRENT (to camera)Right, so today’s the big day. The Coventry Conference. Regional sales conference for all the Wernham Hogg branches. And guess who’s been asked to give the keynote speech? (taps chest) That’s right. David Brent. They could have chosen anyone, but they chose the best. (pause) Well, I say chosen. I volunteered. But they accepted immediately, so…
Cut to talking head:
DAVID BRENT (talking head)This is huge for me. Career-wise, respect-wise, legend-wise. After today, people will remember where they were when David Brent delivered his speech. Like when Kennedy was shot, or when England won the World Cup, or when… (thinks) …when I delivered my speech at the Coventry Conference.
INT. WERNHAM HOGG OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
TIM CANTERBURY approaches Brent’s desk where GARETH KEENAN is standing at attention.
TIMMorning, David. Big day today?
DAVID BRENTTimothy. (stands up) Not just big. Monumental. I’ve been preparing this presentation for weeks. It’s going to revolutionize how people think about paper sales. And management. And… life, really.
GARETHDavid’s asked me to be his wingman today. I’ll be providing tactical support and crowd assessment.
TIM (to camera)Wingman?
GARETHIt’s a military term. I’ll be watching for hostile elements in the audience, monitoring David’s hydration levels, and ensuring optimal presentation conditions.
TIM (pause)Right. And how exactly will you be doing that?
GARETHI’ve brought backup slides on three different memory sticks, energy bars, throat lozenges, and a small pair of binoculars to read the crowd’s facial expressions.
Tim stares at the camera with his trademark expression.
DAWN TINSLEY approaches from reception.
DAWNDavid, there’s been a call from Coventry. They want to know if you need the microphone tested beforehand.
DAVID BRENT(laughs) Do I need the microphone tested? Dawn, I’ve been using microphones since before most people knew what sound was. I’m a natural. But yes, tell them I’ll be there early for a full technical rehearsal. Professional standards.
Cut to talking head:
TIM (talking head)David’s been practicing his speech in the office for two weeks. Yesterday he made us all sit through it during lunch. It’s… well, it’s very David. Lots of unnecessary tangents, several impressions that don’t quite work, and at least three references to his time as a traveling salesman, which I’m fairly certain he’s made up.
INT. CONFERENCE HOTEL - COVENTRY - DAY
A bland hotel conference room with round tables and a small stage. Various WERNHAM HOGG employees from different branches mill about with name badges and coffee. Brent enters with Gareth wheeling a suitcase behind him.
DAVID BRENTRight, this is it, Gareth. The big leagues. (surveys room) Intimate venue. Good. More personal. More impactful.
He approaches the CONFERENCE ORGANIZER, a harried-looking woman with a clipboard.
CONFERENCE ORGANIZERMr. Brent? I’m Sarah from head office. We spoke on the phone.
DAVID BRENTSarah! (goes in for an inappropriate hug) The woman of the hour. Well, I’m the man of the hour, but you’re definitely woman of the… period leading up to the hour.
CONFERENCE ORGANIZERRight. So, you’re scheduled to speak for fifteen minutes about sales techniques and team motivation.
DAVID BRENTFifteen minutes? (laughs) Sarah, Sarah, Sarah. You can’t contain genius in fifteen minutes. I was thinking more like thirty, forty minutes. Really give them value for money.
CONFERENCE ORGANIZERWe have a very tight schedule, Mr. Brent. Fifteen minutes, then questions.
DAVID BRENT(deflated but recovering) No, no, you’re right. Keep them wanting more. Classic presentation technique. (winks at camera)
Meanwhile, other regional managers are arriving. We see NEIL GODWIN from Swindon enter and immediately several people gravitate toward him.
GARETH (to camera)Neil Godwin. Swindon branch. David’s main rival. I’ve done reconnaissance on him. He’s got good numbers, but David’s got the X-factor. The indefinable quality that separates leaders from followers.
Cut to Neil chatting easily with other managers, laughing at something someone has said.
GARETH (continuing)Although his people skills are admittedly quite strong.
INT. CONFERENCE HOTEL - BACKSTAGE AREA - DAY
Brent is pacing behind a curtain, doing vocal exercises. Gareth stands guard with his binoculars.
DAVID BRENTRed leather, yellow leather. Red leather, yellow leather. (to camera) Professional warm-ups. Learned these from a drama teacher. Well, I say learned. She was teaching them to someone else and I overheard.
He pulls out his notes, which are extensively highlighted and annotated.
DAVID BRENTRight, key points: sales are about relationships, I’m proof that you can be successful and still be down-to-earth, and… (checking notes) …finish with the guitar. Yes. (pats guitar case) Secret weapon.
GARETHDavid, I’ve done a sweep of the audience. Swindon contingent is in the front right, Reading branch back left. I’ve identified three potential hecklers and one person who might be recording on their phone.
DAVID BRENTGood work. Any sign of press? Local paper, trade publications?
GARETH (pause)No, David. I don’t think there’s any press here.
DAVID BRENT(disappointed but rallying) Well, that’s probably for the best. Don’t want to overwhelm them with too much success at once.
INT. CONFERENCE HOTEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY
The audience is seated. About forty people, looking like they’d rather be anywhere else. The Conference Organizer takes the microphone.
CONFERENCE ORGANIZERRight, our next speaker is David Brent from the Slough branch. David will be talking about sales techniques and team motivation. David?
Polite, unenthusiastic applause. Brent bounds onto the small stage with excessive energy.
DAVID BRENTThank you, thank you. (adjusts microphone) Right, can everyone hear me at the back? (no response) I’ll take that as a yes.
He surveys the room with what he clearly thinks is a commanding presence.
DAVID BRENTSales. It’s not just about selling, is it? It’s about… (long pause) …relationships. And I should know, because I’m probably the most successful branch manager here today. (pause for effect that doesn’t come) Not probably. Definitely. Well, second most successful. Neil Godwin’s numbers are technically higher, but that’s just numbers, isn’t it?
Cut to Neil in the audience, looking puzzled.
DAVID BRENTThe thing about sales is, you’ve got to be a people person. You’ve got to understand psychology. Human nature. What makes people tick. And I do. I’m like a… a sales psychologist. A psychosalesman. (pleased with himself) I might trademark that.
The audience is starting to look restless. Someone checks their watch.
DAVID BRENTNow, I know what you’re thinking. “David, how do you motivate a team?” And it’s simple. You’ve got to be their friend, but also their boss. Their mate, but also their superior. Their equal, but also their better. It’s a delicate balance, but I’ve mastered it.
Cut to talking head:
NEIL GODWIN (talking head)I’ve heard about David Brent. He’s… well, he’s certainly unique. I suppose there’s something to be said for confidence, but there’s a line between confidence and… whatever this is.
INT. CONFERENCE HOTEL - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Brent is now pacing the stage, warming to his theme.
DAVID BRENTLeadership isn’t about being popular. Although I am. Very popular. My team love me. They’re like family to me. I’m like the fun dad they never had. Or the cool older brother. Or the mentor figure who also happens to be… (pauses) …quite attractive.
An uncomfortable silence. Someone coughs.
DAVID BRENTRight, let me give you an example. Recently, I had to make some difficult decisions. Redundancies. But I handled it with sensitivity, with grace, with… (struggles) …humanity. Because that’s what separates good managers from great managers. The human touch.
He suddenly stops and grins at the audience.
DAVID BRENTTell you what, I think we could all use a bit of levity. Anyone know this one?
He starts doing an impression that’s unclear to everyone watching.
DAVID BRENT“I’ll be back!” (pause) That’s Terminator. Austrian accent. Arnold Schwarzenegger. (no reaction) Very popular film. Anyway…
He trails off, looking at the sea of blank faces.
DAVID BRENTRight, well, moving on. The key to successful sales is… (consulting his notes) …is believing in your product. And I do. I believe in paper. I love paper. We all love paper. Where would we be without paper? (pause) Paperless, that’s where.
Cut to Tim in the audience, head in hands.
DAVID BRENTBut it’s not just about the paper. It’s about the dreams. The hopes. The… the papery aspirations of everyone in this room. We’re not just selling paper. We’re selling… (long pause) …possibilities.
He’s clearly losing them. Even Gareth looks concerned.
DAVID BRENTYou know what? I think this calls for a song.
Audible groans from the audience. He produces his guitar.
DAVID BRENTThis is a little number I wrote called “Slough.” It’s about my branch, but really, it’s about all of our branches. It’s about… life.
He strums a chord. It’s out of tune.
DAVID BRENT (singing)“Slough, it’s not just a place,It’s a state of mind,Where paper dreams come true,And success you’ll find…”
The Conference Organizer is frantically signaling for him to wrap up. The audience looks mortified.
DAVID BRENT (continuing to sing)“We’re more than just a team,We’re family, you see,And I’m the leader,Setting everyone free…”
Finally, mercifully, he stops.
DAVID BRENTThank you. (pause) Questions?
Dead silence. Eventually, one brave soul raises their hand.
AUDIENCE MEMBERYes, um, do you have any actual sales figures to share?
DAVID BRENTFigures? (laughs) Well, success can’t always be measured in numbers, can it? Although our numbers are very good. Excellent, in fact. Top… well, top half certainly. Upper middle. Solidly upper middle.
Another hand.
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2What’s your staff turnover rate?
DAVID BRENT(defensive) Low. Very low. Virtually non-existent. People don’t leave my team, they… they graduate. They move on to bigger and better things because I’ve prepared them so well. It’s actually a problem, keeping good people. They’re too successful.
Cut to talking head:
TIM (talking head)Staff turnover rate at Slough is actually quite high. But David has a unique way of interpreting statistics. Rather like how he interprets reality, really.
INT. CONFERENCE HOTEL - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The Conference Organizer has had enough.
CONFERENCE ORGANIZERRight, well, I think that’s all we have time for. Thank you, David.
Polite but relieved applause. Brent clearly thinks it’s going better than it is.
DAVID BRENTThank you, thank you all. Remember, it’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey. And what a journey we’re all on together. In paper. (pause) Thank you.
He takes an elaborate bow. Someone in the audience whispers “Finally.”
INT. CONFERENCE HOTEL - BAR AREA - LATER
Post-conference drinks. Small groups of people chatting. Brent sits alone at the bar with Gareth, nursing a pint.
DAVID BRENTI think that went very well. Really connected with them. You could feel the energy in the room.
GARETHDefinitely. I saw several people taking notes during the guitar bit.
DAVID BRENT(brightening) Did you? See, that’s the thing about innovation. People need time to process it. To digest it. This will be talked about for years.
Neil Godwin approaches with a few other managers.
NEILDavid, interesting presentation.
DAVID BRENT(standing up quickly) Neil! Thanks, yeah. Bit different from the usual corporate spiel, wasn’t it? Bit more… authentic.
NEILIt was certainly memorable. The song was… unexpected.
DAVID BRENT(proud) That’s my signature move. The personal touch. Anyone can do a PowerPoint presentation, can’t they? But how many people can write their own material? Perform it live? That takes courage.
NEILIt does indeed.
An awkward pause.
OTHER MANAGERWell, we should probably head back. Early start tomorrow.
NEILYes, absolutely. Good luck with everything, David.
They leave. Brent watches them go, his confidence starting to waver.
DAVID BRENT (to camera)You see, that’s respect. Professional respect. They’re probably intimidated, to be honest. It’s hard to follow an act like that.
Cut to talking head:
DAVID BRENT (talking head)Today was a triumph. A complete triumph. I could tell from the audience reaction that I’d really struck a chord. Pun intended. (pause) Although, looking back, I might have gone a bit over the fifteen-minute limit. But when inspiration strikes, you can’t just turn it off, can you? That wouldn’t be fair to the audience.
INT. WERNHAM HOGG OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
Brent is back at his desk, looking through what appears to be feedback forms. His expression gradually changes from confident to concerned to deflated.
TIMHow did it go yesterday, David?
DAVID BRENT(looking up, forcing brightness) Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Really made an impact. (pause) Although, these feedback forms are… interesting. Apparently, some people found my presentation “unconventional.”
TIMRight.
DAVID BRENTAnd “lengthy.” And… (reading) …“deeply uncomfortable to watch.” But that’s just one person’s opinion, isn’t it? One person who probably doesn’t understand innovation when they see it.
He continues reading.
DAVID BRENT(reading) “Please never invite this man back.” Well, that’s just… that’s constructive feedback, isn’t it? They’re being honest. I respect that.
Dawn appears.
DAWNDavid, there’s someone from head office on the phone for you.
DAVID BRENT(perking up) Probably want to congratulate me. Or book me for another conference. (to camera) This could be the start of something big.
He picks up the phone.
DAVID BRENTDavid Brent speaking. (pause) Yes, about yesterday. (pause) Right. (longer pause) I see. (pause) No, I understand. (pause) Well, thank you for the feedback.
He hangs up, looking deflated.
TIMEverything alright?
DAVID BRENT(trying to maintain dignity) Fine. Just some… procedural stuff. Apparently, there were some complaints about the length of my presentation. And the… content. And the singing. But mainly the length.
GARETHWhat kind of complaints?
DAVID BRENT(defensive) Petty stuff. Professional jealousy, really. Some people can’t handle innovation. Can’t handle seeing someone at the top of their game. It’s tall poppy syndrome, isn’t it? Cut down the tall poppies.
He stares off into the distance.
DAVID BRENT(quietly) Although they did say the guitar was out of tune.
Cut to talking head:
DAVID BRENT (talking head)The thing about being a pioneer is that people don’t always understand what you’re doing at first. Van Gogh only sold one painting in his lifetime. The Beatles were rejected by multiple record labels. I’m not saying I’m Van Gogh or the Beatles, but… (pause) …well, actually, in terms of innovation and artistic vision, there are definitely parallels.
INT. WERNHAM HOGG OFFICE - LATER
The office is winding down for the day. Brent sits at his desk, occasionally glancing at the feedback forms. Tim approaches.
TIMYou alright, David?
DAVID BRENT(looking up) Yeah, fine. Just reflecting on yesterday. Taking stock. Learning from the experience.
TIMRight.
DAVID BRENTThe thing is, Tim, sometimes when you’re ahead of the curve, people don’t get it immediately. They need time. Historical perspective. In fifty years’ time, business students will study that presentation. They’ll write dissertations about it.
TIMProbably.
DAVID BRENT(pause) Although I might tone down the guitar bit next time. Make it more… accessible.
TIM (kindly)Might be worth considering.
Brent nods thoughtfully, then suddenly brightens.
DAVID BRENTYou know what, though? I enjoyed it. I got up there, I said what I wanted to say, I performed my heart out. How many people can say they’ve done that? How many people have the courage to put themselves out there like that?
TIMNot many.
DAVID BRENTExactly. So in a way, yesterday was a success. Maybe not a conventional success, but a personal success. A spiritual success.
He starts packing up his things.
DAVID BRENTBesides, they’ve already asked me to consider doing a workshop on… (checks notes) …“What not to do at conferences.” Which is basically the same thing, isn’t it? Just from a different angle.
He heads toward the exit, then turns back to the camera one last time.
DAVID BRENTThe Coventry Conference, 2003. Remember where you were when you heard about it.
He exits. The camera lingers on the empty office for a moment.
FADE OUT.

I smelled like perfume until I got home and showered and my purchases are airing in my garage. Since this has happened to me in Ulta also, I had decided to order online from them because I’ve not had a problem with things coming from their shipping facility before. Friends, the mascaras I ordered from Ulta came with a perfume sample in the package, so they also smell and are also airing in my garage. This was my stock up on Too Faced mascara and I had intended to keep them in their boxes until I was ready to use them, but I may need to rethink that plan. 

(Even my Ulta purchases that I picked up 3 weeks ago and were airing in my garage are still fragrant and I had to clean them and set them outside in the sun to air out.)

I’ve had a few interactions with Ulta about this before one time I was doing an online order pickup and their sales people ignored me and I started having an asthma attack in the store. They told me that they can’t control the perfume samples that people spray in the store. I remember the days when perfume samples were staffed and sprayed directly onto a card of paper to waft and smell, coffee grounds were provided to absorb the smells, and it was not a free for all in the perfume department. But, of course, that cuts into the store’s bottom line because customer service is expensive…

1nmtmdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1nmtmdv/i_cant_stand_her/,I can’t stand her,"

(20F) (23M)  For context, she’s my boyfriend’s mom but since we plan to get married in the near future she’s to be my mother in law. This is just me venting because I’m usually a very patient person and this has me going half crazy. 

-For starters she can’t seem to stop talking. About ANYTHING. It’s as if she speaks every word that pops into her head. If she’s not talking to somebody she’s talking to herself, talking on the phone very loudly. Singing. She’s overall very noisy. Playing videos on her phone on full blast, always clearing her throat and grunting and just vocalizing every physical and mental thing. As if she’s acting in a movie. Always clanging dishes around if people are sleeping or reading. If you’re CLEARLY doing something that requires your full attention she’ll start conversations with you and then continue to talk to you in another room to the point she’s shouting and venting into thin air. Ive tried ignoring her, but then she’ll respond with “Yknow what I mean?” Or “Are you hearing me?” I don’t have the heart to tell her that I can’t/dont want to talk because I sorta feel bad. 
-She’s always complaining about the SAME THINGS over and over again. Or just incessant randomness. For the past two months she’s been going through a divorce and that’s a whole other story. But she always brings it up everyday multiple times. When my boyfriend and I weren’t around she’d talk about her partner us over the phone or something would happen and we’d be all worked up and anxious about her and her safety. For context my boyfriend had told her not to get involved with this person since he wasn’t a good person and he was right. They were married for a few months before it hit the fan. She goes back and forth between crying randomly saying how much she misses him and then cussing him out and saying he’s this and that. Saying how much of a victim she is. And I’m at the point where every conversation I have with her I’m just yupping and mhmming my way through. Like what do I have to contribute to these conversations besides my attention? AND EVEN THATS IMPOSSIBLE. She’s a broken record period. Just whenever she talks she always sounds like she’s complaining and makes herself appear all high and mighty like she knows better than everyone. As well as correcting me like about the way I fold clothes, cook food, making suggestions about my clothing etc. I know how to do these things.
 -I’m always cleaning up after her. I’ll clean the entire kitchen from the floors, the countertops, the dishes. Then she’ll manage to dirty up like 5 pieces of dishes  making peanut butter and crackers. Leaving half cups of coffee everywhere. I don’t understand. It’s as if she knows I’m cleaning up and she thinks I’ll just brush it off. 
-Running errands with her is a nightmare. Grocery store, beauty store, out to eat. Anywhere is a nightmare. We’ll go in a store for one thing we need. And she’ll end up spending an hour looking at things she might not end up buying. ALSO after she checks out she’ll remember she forgot something and go back in the store and just continue shopping again. it’s odd. I’ve also noticed she puts retail/restaurant employees through misery. Asking them multiple questions, some non related to where we are, and I can see it on the persons face they just want to get back to doing their job. Anytime we’re out to eat she always finds something to complain about, it’s never the way she likes it. I can count with my fingers every time she’s sent food back. This is also a side note but driving with her is anxiety inducing. She knows how to use GPS, but chooses not to use it when she doesn’t know where we’re going. ONE TIME we were on our way to pick something up at the post office, and instead of taking the usual route (which is a 5 minute drive) she said she wants to learn a “different route” because she wants to stop at her beauty store. Oh yeah! And then she’ll remember she needs to get gas and she forgets what she was doing in the first place. Just the most confusing shit like this all the time. 
-She treats me like I’m her own daughter and I hate it. Calling me her baby doll baby girl and touching my hair and it’s clear she wants to spend time with me because she always offers for me to go with her to get hair or nails done with her, or go shopping for clothes and furniture. I don’t go because I want to save myself the headache and I only feel like I’m there to be her emotional support animal. 
-She’s a hypocrite. She’s always saying how she’s not like those other women who complain. Couldn’t be more wrong. 
It’s  almost as if she does this stuff on purpose? Or is she actually just this scatterbrained sometimes? I don’t know. This was just me venting. ",4,1758465385.0,motherinlawsfromhell,2,0.83,False

Some background: I did the treatment from Mon-Fri, 10 sessions per day (600 biphasic bursts each session, so 6000 bursts per day), 50 sessions in total.  

I'm also a coffee drinker but I decided to stop caffeine for the duration of the treatment, so the last time I had coffee was on the Sunday before the treatment. 

# Treatment (Mon-Fri)

**Mon**: Concentration dipped massively. I had to do an assessment at the end of the day & I struggled to even read the words on the paper. It felt like my eyes were hurting, the lights were too bright, and I just couldn't focus at all. I was also craving coffee and having a headache due to the withdrawal. Also craving fast food at the end of the day.

**Tue**: Same issue, concentration still terrible, worse than pre-tms. Light-sensitivity, and massively craving coffee.

**Wed Morn**: Craving coffee. But concentration seems a bit better.

**Wed Afternoon**: Craving for both caffeine and fast food completely gone. But appetite has also decreased. I feel sad & weepy. Concentration better. Read a book. Could read the words on the assessment I have to do at the end of each day much better. Went home and cried (I don't know when was the last time I cried prior to this. It must have been 7 months ago or something).

**Thu**: Similar to previous afternoon. Concentration as per previous day (i.e. better than day 1 & 2, and somewhat better than pre-tms also). No craving for caffeine at all. Appetite still low. Still sad, went home and cried.

**Fri Morn**: Similar to previous day. Concentration same as wed & thu. No craving. Still sad.

**Fri Afternoon**: Concentration has dipped quite a lot. Struggling to focus. Feel like I'm in a fog. Feeling  even more depressed. Partly because the treatment is ending soon and it doesn't seem to have helped me. Want to cry. Suicidal thoughts have increased also.

Treatment ended at the end of the day on Fri.

# Post-treatment

**Sat**: Focus/concentration the worst it has been all week. The worst it has been in months and months actually. More depressed than I've felt in months. Suicidal thoughts increasing. Couldn't do a single thing. Very, very dissociated. No craving for coffee.

**Sun (today)**: Same as previous day but worse. Concentration way worse. Can't do a thing, can hardly keep my eyes open. Completely dissociated, feeling paralysed in some way, like I just sit there and stare... unable to get up and do anything. Thoughts of suicide getting worse. More depressed. No craving for coffee.

I'll update again in a few weeks or so if there are any changes. I don't regret having done this treatment because I was basically out of options. But I really hope I will get better in some way, or at least go back to my pre-tms state.",1,1758465189.0,rtms,5,1.0,False
1nmtjaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1nmtjaa/wife_wants_to_leave/,Wife wants to leave,"My wife has recently decided to leave the church. we married young , 19 & 21 in the temple for almost 14 years and have 4 children. We were childhood friends that started dating and turned into marriage. We both come from homes that were strongly based in the church and its values. We have both been active our whole lives. 

She has stated the usual reasons about having doubt with Joseph smith, polygamy, new understandings of old doctrine like what we will do in heaven and the book of Abraham, patriarchy  and toxic church culture. All of this is sudden. Obviously I knew she’s had doubts with things over the years but I always believed her when she told me she found answers or was at peace with not knowing everything. I don’t want to belittle her struggles but all her current views and reasoning are all the same as the famous anti-Mormon TikTokers. 

This all came to light when I noticed a sudden decline in spirituality. She stopped going to church( I have a job that requires I work most sundays), started openly swearing, and drinking coffee. Became obsessed with tattoos and piercings and stoped carrying about modesty. When I confronted her she said she wanted to leave. I asked if she wanted to talk to the missionaries or the bishop and she responded “If I did I feel it would just go in circles, like trying to leave an MLM company”.  She said she would still let the kids go to church but wouldn’t take them. I was praying and fasting for her every single day. 
 
In trying to figure out the new future and what it means for the family she said she also had plans to the marriage. We’ve had major conflicts but never to the point of leaving( she had been previously abusive to me for most of our marriage and we were trying to recover from it). With that new information it obviously lead to extreme arguments. After days had past she said she was willing to try again. She said she realized how negative it would be for the kids and me. She said she wanted to speak to the bishop and work towards coming back. I honestly believe that was a miracle. 

After meeting with the bishop she was extremely disappointed, he told her it’s okay to have doubts and she could still go to the temple and encouraged her to go. She was hoping for debate and concrete answers. She keeps saying she is trying but she speaks and act like she has left. She refuses to talk about the answers I found about her doubts and just says she will consider it. She says that all my answers and sources have been washed by the church to change history. I know she has doubts and I don’t expect them to go away but I didn’t think she would be so angry. Some days she says she’s committed to the church and changing but then doesn’t act on it or says she can’t change fast enough. Recently she said she was lying about wanting to come back at all. 

Im still in love with my wife and want what is best for her. I feel that if I let her leave the church she will also leave the marriage. I feel like I’m losing my eternal family and salvation. I feel I have failed her as her husband and priesthood leader for not acting sooner. I have been praying and fasting constantly, I’ve gone to the temple, I’ve reached out to family and asked them for pray her and now I don’t feel anything. I don’t feel peace anymore. I don’t have clarity or a direction to go. I feel completely alone. I honestly believe in God and know that he loves everyone, but I feel he doesn’t love me anymore. I can’t feel his love.  No matter what talks or scriptures I read I still feel darkness and alone. 

I don’t know what to do next. Has anyone been through something similar? Has anyone let their spouse go and been better for it? How do I tell the kids “mom doesn’t believe in God anymore but we still do.”?  With a temple marriage, when and how do I let divorce happen? When do I give up and when do I keep fighting? I’m at the stage where everyday I have to beg my wife to stay married and not give up on God. What comes next?

I will start by explaining my journey. I was a workaholic. I made good money but I got fatter and fatter. Until I had health issues. (Lost money, lost health)

* I tried running to lose weight, didn’t help.
* I tried eating less without working out (didn’t help).
* I tried gym workouts, proteins (didn’t help).

When I was in the hospital for 7 days, I looked at the doctor and asked what to do? He told me: get fit. I said but I don’t have time, I’ve never exercised (like every day). He looked at me and said: look at yourself. That’s all he said.

Then my friend, who always knows everything, told me it is simpler than you think. Listen to me (an uneducated fool): you will lose 20kg guaranteed, just respect it for 6 months.

I said fine. I lost a couple of years trying it on my own. I will commit to 6 months. So I did.
* I ate well
* I was never hungry (only the first 5 days)
* I didn’t have a crazy workout routine

I lost 30kg just by walking.

😵‍💫Now you probably think how is this possible.
* walking
* eating well (only protein, little carbs – rice, potato only) (without feeling hunger)
* counting calories (roughly, not crazy like measuring everything like fitness guys)
* fasting (basically – only water or Coke Zero after 6)
* 1 cheat meal per week (not crazy amounts – only after the first 2 weeks passed)

I would love to create an app for getting fit by walking, calorie counting and fasting.

answer a couple of questions and help me help more people.

Tip:
1.	Don’t lie to yourself. If you said you will commit – commit. If you can’t trust and rely on yourself, how can others?
2.	The first 2.5 weeks are the hardest. Later it is just a regular day and food.
3.	No sugar in any way. If you drink coffee with sugar, remove it completely from your diet. Drink espresso – not everything in life should be sweet.

Maybe some age on it would mellow it out.

1nmtefd,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1nmtefd/trip_report_istanbul_2025/,Trip Report: Istanbul 2025,"Istanbul is a city I've frequently returned to since initially visiting on holiday in 2019. As a preface to the rest of the article, I will tell you immediately that it's somewhere **I love** working from. The chaos, the food, the weather and the people all combine to make for an utterly distinctive destination. 

After four enjoyable but somewhat quiet months in the sedate cities of Central Asia, I was craving a return to the rhythm of a proper urban setting, and a late-summer month in Istanbul fitted the bill perfectly.

For context, I'm a 35-year-old Product Designer from the UK and have been doing this lifestyle post-COVID.

Worth mentioning as an initial disclaimer: I'm fully aware of the recent issues the country has been experiencing. I know from Turkish friends and colleagues just how challenging recent years have been for the vast majority of the population. It's no doubt a country with more issues than most. More than a lot of other places, swanning in with foreign-earned currency is likely to give you a dramatically different experience of the city than the locals. If you're planning a visit, have a read up to soak up some context. Now onto the good stuff.  


# 🏠 Where to stay 

More so than most other cities, due to its sheer size, the location you choose to stay in will heavily dictate the nature of your visit. The city is well connected through a combination of the metro, Marmaray and ferry boats, but it's worth being particularly intentional with where you plan to live and work.

The quality and service associated with Airbnbs tend to be hit and miss throughout Turkey, and Istanbul is no exception. General availability is sub-par, with insatiable demand from both year-round tourists and the 15 million people who call it home.

Finding a good deal, especially during peak seasons, requires persistence and luck. A core issue is the historic building stock in popular areas around Beyoğlu. More modern units are found outside the immediate tourist areas, in residential neighbourhoods towards Osmanbey, Beşiktaş and Şişli.

Expect to pay around £1,200 per calendar month for a reasonable quality, renovated one-bedroom flat in a central location. New-to-market apartments come up frequently, so you may grab a relative bargain on an unproven unit. Occasionally you may see cheaper deals in Fatih, but if it's your first time visiting, I'd avoid those more conservative areas.

If you're sensitive to noise, pay close attention to reviews, especially near Taksim. I stayed on Süslü Saksı Street and whilst incredibly convenient, being routinely woken at 3AM by techno parties in December somewhat hindered the experience.

Book well in advance and pay attention to where you plan to work from. Whilst public transport is generally efficient, some journeys take far longer than you may anticipate.

Istanbul sits in a highly active seismic zone with a history of devastating earthquakes. It's only a matter of time before the next major event occurs, and you may see newer properties carrying 'earthquake-proof' tags. 

Having stayed on both the European and Asian sides numerous times, I don't think there's a concrete answer on which is better. Both are great. Try and find the best Airbnb your budget can stretch to and explore the other side at the weekend, as unless you have particularly deep pockets you won't be able to be too picky.

If you're planning a longer trip, consider splitting your time between the two. There are so many neighbourhoods you could mention, but if you are new to the city, I'd prioritise these four. 

**✅ Kadıköy** \- If you are visiting during the summer months, this would be my number one pick. Kadıköy is the main hub on the Asian side of the city, equally, if not more vibrant and hectic in its narrow streets, but markedly less touristy than the main draws in Beyoğlu. A lifetime's worth of local restaurants, coffee shops and bars, it also features Moda Park, which runs along the coastline and is the perfect place to unwind in the evenings, with no real direct equivalent in terms of convenience on the European side. Airbnb stock is particularly low and expensive in the area, so book as far in advance as possible if looking for a prolonged stay.

**✅ Cihangir** \- A particularly difficult pronunciation, roughly equating to 'chee-han-GEAR', the area is set a short walk from the madness of İstiklal and provides one of the most liberal, bohemian settings across the city. Expect to find lots of small independent shops and boutiques, and it's surprisingly peaceful considering its proximity to one of Beyoğlu's main arterial walkways.

**✅ Galata / Pera** \- A perfect destination for a first-time visit if you want a quintessential experience of the city and to be within walking distance of a glut of main attractions. The sheer volume of daily tourists around the tower and a surprisingly poor choice of supermarkets makes it something of a less appealing destination for a longer-term stay. But if you don't mind featuring in several wedding photography shoots, it's an incredibly convenient place to call home. One of the best features is the beautiful daily commute to the COBAC co-working space, around a 20-minute walk crossing over the Haliç bridge and Golden Horn. At the bottom of the hill, neighbouring Karaköy is also worth equal consideration.

**✅ Beşiktaş** \- One of the liveliest areas of the city, full of bars, restaurants and the football team of the same name. No metro station but well connected by the ferry boats and a relatively short walk up the hill to Taksim Square and Nişantaşı. A slightly more local feel than if staying closer to the areas around İstiklal and Galata, less inundated with tourists, but equally as electric.

**Bomonti / Osmanbey** \- Around a 30-minute walk further north from the madness of Taksim, Bomonti has a dramatically more local and residential feel, yet still within close reach of everything, with the M2 metro line conveniently taking you further north or south across the city. Perhaps not the most immersive option if it's your first visit to the city, but if you are looking for more of a realistic longer-term base in Beyoğlu, this could be a good fit. I briefly worked from the Workinton branch there on one previous visit, which is a fine, if unremarkable, base if in the area. Better for longer term stays but also a great option if you want something more relaxed. 

**❌ Fatih** \- Only a 15-minute walk from Galata, but generally regarded as one of the more conservative areas of the city, you're unlikely to want to spend too much time in this district, where you're much more likely to find a mosque than a bar. Particularly busy around Eminönü port, with attractions like the Mısır Çarşısı and Topkapi Palace bringing in huge crowds year-round. Sort of place you're likely to walk around once or twice on your first visit with little need to make a return journey.   


# 💻 Where to work 

A major reason why I love coming back to Istanbul is the [**COBAC coworking space.**](https://cobac.com.tr/en/coworking) 

A strong contender for my favourite place to work from. Ever. I've returned to this office each time I've been in Istanbul, and each time it's retained the same charm that impressed me so much initially.

If you're planning on working from Istanbul, I'd strongly suggest making this your first port of call, and I would even go as far as suggesting it's worth planning your accommodation to be somewhere within an easy commute.

So why all the praise? The office is split over four floors, with an abundance of natural light in every area. The fit-out has a modern aesthetic that you might associate with something similar to WeWork, but with more personality.

The main communal co-working spaces are on the third and fourth floors, alongside private offices, with particularly comfortable sofas and soft furnishings dotted around for taking calls.

There's light background music audible throughout all areas of the building, but not at levels that feel intrusive like in a WeWork. Katy Perry is not piercing your eardrums. It rarely feels anywhere near full capacity and you can arrive at any time of day without being concerned about squeezing in.

The rooftop provides panoramic views over the Golden Horn, with a café serving tasty, fresh meals and coffee all day at very competitive prices. Expect Turkish staples like menemen, simit and mantı, alongside international options. The kitchen staff, baristas and office personnel are all incredibly friendly and welcoming and make for a refreshing departure from the transient nature of passing through a WeWork. Free filter coffee and Turkish tea are available on tap from 8am until late.

Even though I'd strongly recommend not staying in the local area, Haliç metro and a ferry terminal are within a five-minute walk, making it easily reachable across the city.

If you stay in Galata, it's a beautiful summer morning's walk across Haliç Bridge and one of my favourite commutes from 50+ cities. If you are in Kadıköy, ferry boats to Eminönü take around 25 minutes and leave frequently.

# 💵 Value 

Whether or not you find Istanbul good value in 2025 will largely hinge on your personal tastes. Importantly, it's worth noting that for Turks earning locally in lira, there is only one answer. The lira is low, inflation remains high and local purchasing power is weak.

I've read plenty on prices skyrocketing over the last couple of years across Turkey, but Istanbul seems to have avoided the worst of the excesses, with beachside resorts on the coastline like Bodrum more susceptible to eye-watering inflation. Prices are higher than they were in 2023, but for most of my day-to-day expenses, not in a significant manner.

If you are bringing external currency, in many ways it remains excellent value. A rapidly served, tasty meal consisting of a meat and vegetable dish, rice and a side can still be had for under £5 in one of the city's many casual lokantas. A freshly charcoal-grilled kebab, bulgur, salad and bread can be found for a similar price. A 50cl domestic beer in a bar in a popular area around Taksim or Kadıköy costs around £3.50, and even cheaper at the nightly happy hours. Public transport is uniformly cheap, around 50p a journey, and local produce from markets is less than what you would expect in Western Europe.

Should your tastes become more refined however, costs can mount. Speciality coffee and cakes from coffee shops are similar to what you would expect in London. International cuisines in more refined restaurants can begin to exceed expectations. Cocktails, wine and craft beers in high-end areas like Nişantaşı can rapidly surpass what you might pay in premium European cities.

Prices often feel like they don't make sense in Turkey. In general, I would suggest budgeting as you may do in any other Western European city.

If you are happy to eat locally and curtail evening extravagances, then you'll likely find some decent change left over from what you originally planned.



# ⚠️ Safety 

* **Considering its size, Istanbul is a very safe city by global standards.** The streets are generally busy throughout all hours of the day, especially around the nighttime venues around Taksim and Kadıköy. There's generally a visible but not overbearing police presence at checkpoints around these areas. I've never seen anything troubling on any trip to the city that would cause concern, and it doesn't appear to suffer from the recent rise in issues like organised phone thefts that have become prominent in cities such as London. Political protests are a common occurrence in the city, so you may want to consider giving them a wide berth to avoid getting swept up in trouble.
* **From my experiences in Istanbul, it's rare that you would get overcharged as a tourist.** However, it's much more common that you inadvertently go somewhere which has excessively high prices for no apparent reason. A good example may be a meal from a lokanta along İstiklal Street, which can almost double in price depending on location. If you walk an extra 200 metres down an alley, a meal of the exact same quality can be found for 50% of the cost.

There are two scams however that you should keep an awareness of:

* **Scam #1.** A seemingly careless shoe shiner will drop his brush on the floor behind you. Playing on your goodwill in returning it to him, he will seek to then clean your shoes for an excessively high fee with some force. If you're walking around Galata or İstiklal and you hear a brush dropping on the floor, gracefully ignore it and go about your daily business. Once you are aware of it, you will no doubt see it repeatedly if spending time in the area.
* **Scam #2.** A man will approach you on İstiklal and ask you for a lighter. After sparking up some light conversation in English, he will claim to be on a business trip and act surprised at your origins, saying you appear as if you are from a region within the country to generate some familiarity. He will then try to convince you to join him at a bar where he is 'meeting friends'. This will inevitably turn out to be a strip club where you will no doubt be extorted for every lira in your pocket. I became aware of this one as the man in question made several seedy comments regarding women within the 45 seconds I spoke to him, which flagged some immediate suspicion. I politely rejected his offer and later read up on Reddit about it. After speaking to a friend who used to live in Istanbul and unfortunately 'joined him for a drink' when he was new to the city, I can confirm this is a scenario you can easily avoid.



# 📆 Duration & season 

To see Istanbul at its best, you need to be there during the summer months. Whilst it's got enough draws to be attractive 12 months of the year, the summer is a *dramatically* better experience. The winter and spring weather in Istanbul can be surprisingly grim and not what you typically associate with Turkey. During a December visit in 2022, it felt as if the sun did not rise for 10 days, with more sustained wetter and windier conditions than I could recall from any point during my 30-year endurance of British winters. 

If visiting in the peak of summer, you'll definitely benefit from an apartment with strong air conditioning in both the common areas and bedrooms, which you should explicitly check for, especially if it's an older building. 

Midsummer temperatures are hot but never at a level I've found uncomfortable, with at least a gentle breeze to be found sweeping inland off the water. By mid-September, there's a noticeable shift away from the uniform blue-sky days as autumn makes its presence felt. In terms of duration, if you like big cities, then there is more than enough for a couple of months' stay.  


# 👋🏻 People

Istanbul is well deserving of any clichéd attributions of being 'a melting pot'. Walk down İstiklal Street and you'll encounter accents from people across every inch of the world. Wealthy Arabs indulging in some retail therapy, enthusiastic Spanish-speaking backpackers, Ukrainians and Russians who have relocated since 2022, vocal swathes of North American tourists hovering around historic sites, and groups of African migrants working out of the electrical shops south of Galata Tower. 

Throughout my visits across the country, I've always found the Turkish people to be particularly welcoming and hospitable, and Istanbul is no different. There's a certain degree of genuine warmth and friendliness you feel on repeat visits to bars and restaurants, which feels like it extends past the vendor's no doubt commercial joy of seeing an Englishman consume his 20th portion of *tavuk şiş* throughout the month. 

Even with its sheer size, I've found there to be a surprising continuity regarding people on each return visit to the city. You can recognise the same faces working in restaurants, with much less transience than you would experience somewhere like London. 

On my most recent visit, I bumped into a barmaid whom we mutually recalled from numerous nights of heavy beer drinking three years prior during the 2022 World Cup. This sense of continuity, even in such an enormous city, is something I've scarcely felt in other places and contributes to its charm as somewhere to make repeat visits to.



# ✅ Positives 

* **A distinctive identity.** The structure of Istanbul is utterly unlike any other urban environment in Europe. The Bosphorus running through its core, the meeting of the Golden Horn, the historic buildings and sharp steep ascents around Galata, the Princes' Islands conveniently anchored just off the shoreline. They all combine for an urban experience that has no equivalent on the continent. Riverboats and ferries serve integral parts of the city's transport infrastructure, rather than acting as novelty add-ons and tourist attractions like the Thames in London. The city's numerous and generally well-cared-for street cats and dogs can be found at every turn, frequently sleeping in shade and climbing fridges in shops. Even the aromas drifting through the streets are distinctive, with the combination of the grilled fish and spice markets around Eminönü well etched into my memories of that particular district.
* **An amazing variety of food.** As you'd expect from Turkey's largest city, there's an incredible variety and quality of food to be enjoyed across Istanbul. There are styles of restaurants for every occasion: quick, cheap and tasty meals from a lokanta, raki-infused evenings sampling meze dishes in a meyhane, freshly grilled balık dürüm (fish wraps) from street vendors, to high-end sophistication. Istanbul covers all grounds.
* **Still strong value in 2025.** If you enjoy eating local food, sipping plentiful local çay and minimising your daily intake of cocktails, Istanbul is still incredible value when bringing foreign currency. Accommodation costs are proportionally higher when weighted against your other day-to-day costs, but averaged out over the course of a month, it still offers excellent value by global standards.
* **A true 24/7 city.** Istanbul never seems to properly switch off. You can walk down İstiklal Street at any time of the day and find vast crowds filling it in its entirety. There's an infectious excitement and energy amongst its core urban hubs no matter the day of the week.
* **English generally spoken well.** Most locals you will encounter in coworking spaces, coffee shops and even kebab restaurants will generally speak enough conversational English to get you through most routine transactions. I'd found this to be true across all of my visits to the country, but this resonated particularly strongly on this most recent 2025 trip where I'd spent the previous four months in Central Asia, where English-speaking coverage was particularly low.
* **A perfect city to explore on foot.** The enormity of the city means there are no shortage of routes to explore on foot over the weekends. One of my favourite activities in the city is to pick one of the waterways and walk in whichever direction takes my fancy on any given day. There are generally well-landscaped paths and parks next to all the waterways no matter which direction you go. 



# ❌ Negatives 

* **Istanbul is enormous.** Plan where you're going to stay to minimise the amount of travelling you'll need to do, at least on your initial visit. Some routes which cross waterways, like getting from Taksim to Kadıköy, can take far longer than you expect due to the lack of direct connections between them. Whilst there's a certain romanticism to the ferry boats which you can enjoy at your leisure over the weekends, they're perhaps not as rapid as some journeys would ideally necessitate. Road traffic can be horrendous, especially in the areas leading up to the bridge crossings.
* **It's constantly busy.** If you don't like the hustle and bustle of big cities, it's not going to be for you. You're likely to battle crowds during any trip to the city, whether that's navigating through an impenetrable wall of tourists around Galata, or walking through the densely populated streets of Kadıköy. You can learn to mitigate against this, and the crowds often dissipate rapidly as you venture down side streets, but with over 15 million people calling the city home, crowds are inevitable.
* **Proper winter weather.** Whilst temperatures don't drop as low as in Western Europe, winter conditions can be grim and not what you would typically associate with Turkey. I can recall a particularly uninspiring bout of weather during December 2022 where it felt that the sun did not appear for a period of 10 days, with the dark, watery backstreets of Beyoğlu resembling scenes you could mistake for Gotham.
* **Internet can be patchy.** Most of the Airbnbs I've stayed in have had what would be classed as sub-par stability, with connections frequently dropping and speeds rarely exceeding 20Mbps. Even at the COBAC, there have occasionally been alerts sent around about wider internet connectivity issues from their suppliers. I wouldn't take for granted that your home connection would be sufficient.
* **Poor selection of gyms.** For such a large city, I've found signing up to a decent gym to be challenging. I had a bad experience with the [MACFIT](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6oC9ZQMw4AQvsxdM7) on Istiklal Street previously, where it proved almost impossible to cancel the one-month agreement, resorting to me having to contact their regional manager on LinkedIn for assistance. A look at previous reviews indicates this is not an isolated incident. One-month memberships now appear to be in excess of £100, which is too much, all things considered. On this most recent visit, I signed up to [Focus Fitness Sports Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fN2qNu3MyAYudKix7), which, whilst having an almost primitive selection of equipment, was absolutely fine for £30 a month and conveniently based on Istiklal itself.



# 📋 Tips 

* **Read up on Atatürk.** Even within just 24 hours in Turkey, you'll likely be wondering who this immensely popular man is that you see referenced in old photos everywhere. Someone who is deeply revered almost universally across the country, he is the father of the modern nation, having successfully driven out the Ottomans and set the wheels in motion for wide-reaching social reform. The appreciation for him is unlike anything I can recall seeing for any public national figure anywhere else in the world, and having some familiarity with him is always warmly received by Turks.
* **Equip yourself with some knowledge of the current political climate.** It wouldn't be too dramatic to say that most modern Turks have a deep sense of dismay with the state of politics and economics within the country, largely stemming from Recep Erdoğan's near 25-year hold on power. Inflation, a severely weakened currency and reduced political freedoms have made it an upsetting time for the liberal, Western-leaning younger population.
* **Disregard any price references you see on Google Maps.** With rampant inflation having been an all too familiar part of the Turkish economy in recent years, don't make any assumptions based on prices you may see on menus listed in photos or reviews on Google Maps or any other sources. You can guarantee the price will be higher; the question is just to what magnitude.
* **An eSIM from Mobimatter offers good value.** 20GB currently costs around [£12](https://mobimatter.com/travel-esim/airalo-turkey-20-gb-esim?destination=TR) and avoids some of the bureaucratic hassle you might encounter when trying to purchase a physical SIM card locally.
* **Don't try and risk a slim flight connection between Istanbul and Sabiha Gökçen Airports.** The airports are 85km apart at the extremities of the European and Asian sides of the city. Allow ample time if for any reason you need to travel between the two. Both are connected to metro lines, but anticipate heavy traffic on the roads.
* **Make sure to try a street-side 'Simit'.** These bagel-shaped, circular bread snacks are available across the city, with vendors selling them from small carts. Prices are fixed at around 20 TL currently, so you needn't worry about being overcharged. They're particularly tasty with Nutella.
* **You cannot cross any of the bridges over the Bosphorus on foot.** In my immense naivety, I did attempt this and inevitably failed. Opt for one of the many ferry crossings or take the Marmaray rail service.
* **Consider getting a Dolmuş for some routes.** These small minibuses can be effective for reaching certain destinations, such as between Kadıköy and Taksim/Beşiktaş at night, and don't appear as public transport options on Google. Search for 'Dolmuş station' on Maps and manually navigate yourself there.
* **Bring earplugs.** If you're staying south of Taksim, or close to any other area with concentrated late-night activity, don't count on having a peaceful night's sleep. Having stayed in a few places nearby, I found that the techno clubs can start at 3AM and not finish until sunrise. Better still, give these areas a miss if you're a sensitive sleeper, or confirm some form of soundproofing with your accommodation beforehand.**‍** 
* **Pick up an İstanbulkart to use public transport.** They can be used across all forms of public transport and can be easily topped up at metro, rail and ferry stations. Worth carrying around at all times as they're also used for access to public toilets should nature call.**‍** 
* **Apple Pay is not officially supported in the country.** You'll still be able to pay with it in roughly 75% of places, but there are some notable chain stores like EspressoLab and Carrefour where the card machine will not process the transaction. To be safe, it's best to carry around a physical card and a small amount of change to pick up any particularly appealing food items you may see.
* **Both of Istanbul's airports are horrendous for pricing.** Passing through either of the city's two international airports can make for incredibly poor experiences. Sabiha Gökçen Airport, the secondary airport on the Asian side serving many low-cost airlines, is likely to feel at twice capacity no matter what time of day you're passing through. Turkish airports have always been known as money-gouging exercises, but in recent years the costs have become completely detached from reality, with prices anchored at levels that most Europeans would baulk at and which lira-earning Turks must find purely offensive. The newly constructed Istanbul Airport on the European side is an improvement in that it's larger and less cramped, but it's also a significant journey from the city centre, and the pricing remains equally extortionate. Expect a small pastry from Simit Sarayı to cost €15, compared to €2.50 in the city centre. It's a poor way for people to either enter or exit the country after what is usually such a warm experience.

This was my sixth trip to the city and I found it every bit as inspiring and energising as the first. If you're looking for a big city experience, want something slightly culturally different and are partial to a kebab, I'd offer it strong consideration for an upcoming trip.

[National flags are ubiquitous during any stay within the country, but never more so than during a public holiday. Victory Day in particular, falling at the end of August, will see the streets particularly awash with draped red flags adorning the city's buildings.](https://preview.redd.it/b99zost20jqf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e4878b168c9b01d6ddb74f58fa54405d46976c4)

[One of the common areas in the COBAC co-working space.

[The roof terrace at the COBAC co-working space has an incredible view of the Golden Horn just before it reaches the confluence with the Bosphorus. The rooftop also features a café\/restaurant serving breakfasts, lunch and espressos throughout the day, with ordering conveniently done through their mobile app. You can quite happily spend the entire day going from floor to floor.](https://preview.redd.it/lbeyydf90jqf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0800364052bce99e5ee9092cccdc0e0417e718ff)

[Ferry boats form an important part of the city's transport infrastructure, especially when attempting to cross from the European side to Kadıköy. Alongside well-equipped cafés serving tea and fresh juices, you'll likely find buskers contesting with the ship's engine noises in a battle for your eardrums.](https://preview.redd.it/iusjupgd0jqf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1990f9829269ccd6f7bdda4d28dbe419ef382b0c)

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Raiders vs. Commanders: A Tale of Two QBs, One Chaotic Game**  
The Washington Commanders and Las Vegas Raiders are set to collide in a Week 3 clash that’s equal parts football and circus—no tent required. With Jayden Daniels sidelined for Washington and the Raiders’ Geno Smith still reeling from a 0-for-10, three-interception nightmare, this game is less “Monday Night Football” and more “Monday Night Trauma.” Let’s break it down with the precision of a stat head and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Odds & Implied Probabilities: The Math of Mayhem

The betting market isn’t exactly whispering sweet nothings to the Raiders. Washington is a solid favorite at **-550 implied probability** (decimal odds of 1.65), while Las Vegas sits at **+435** (2.3 decimal), implying a 30.8% chance to win. The spread favors Washington by 3 points, and the total is set at 43.5, suggesting bookmakers expect a high-octane shootout. But let’s not let numbers fool us—this game is a Rorschach test. To some, it’s a defensive grudge match; to others, it’s a QB experiment gone wrong.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Veterans, and a Rookies’ Wild West

Washington’s absence of Daniels is like ordering a pizza and getting a salad—disappointing, but not entirely unexpected. Enter **Marcus Mariota**, the 2015 NFL MVP, who’s been dusting off his cleats since 2022. Terry McLaurin’s praise for Mariota’s “veteran calm” is poetic, but let’s be real: Mariota’s biggest asset is his ability to outrun the memory of his 2022 season. Without Daniels and running back Austin Ekeler, Washington’s offense is a car missing two wheels—still rolling, but with a lot of noise and a tendency to veer off-road.

The Raiders? They’re fielding a QB in Geno Smith who looks like he’s playing chess against the Commanders’ defense: every move is a potential blunder. Their defense? A Jenga tower missing a few critical blocks, with Deatr

So before I was married and for the first couple years of marriage, we lived in town and often hosted friends.  By this I mean we had fun but peaceful gatherings once per week at our rented home since it was the most sensible location - about 14 people every time; a couple people would cook, a couple people would clean - everyone participated in some way to make a meal for everyone, we'd play board games or just chat, sing for a while, then wrap things up by about 9 PM (we probably started at 2 PM).

We moved to a smaller town as we were having more children, and as time goes, our friends mostly moved too or didn't have cars to get there (no public transport) or whatever, so in sum our friend group naturally broke up.  Thats how life goes and it's plays

So I did what I thought was the adult thing when buying a house and moving to a new neighborhood: I knocked on people's doors and said hello to people.  Most people just grunted when they answered.  Really nothing came of saying hello to anyone in a two block radius.

While my eldest was still four years old (others 2 and 0), we joined some families that hosted in a similar way to what we used to do in the big city.  However, this was short lived (only a few months), and while I got along with these other parents and kids really well, it seems like every last one of them wasn't up for hosting anyone, or visiting, or play dates, nothing.  We've met countless parents though play programs, on the street for a walk, school open houses, homeschool meetups, the park...in the end, every last one seems to fall flat on its face.

I'm not speaking here of *merely* other families or kids for my kids to play with.  After going out of my way to meet people, I can't think of any other grown man I can sit and just have a talk and a coffee with.  I've gotten to the point where when I think of my options, I end up just snorting in disgust.

I don't like being this way.  But I'm burnt out.  It been four years here, and my family is just an isolated island.  I love my wife and kids, there's plenty of things we do together - it's just nice to see other adults and families too, you know?

I finally realized that I'm jaded enough from this that I don't even bother looking any more nor do I know how.  Maybe we're not in the right neighborhood and it's just time to move.  I don't know.",1,1758464706.0,AskParents,1,1.0,False

so fast forward to February 2025, Her and my brother went to Arizona to visit her Dad’s family for her birthday and after they came back from Arizona, My parents decided to take her out for her birthday. After we ate, My brother and His girlfriend said they were going to a fair and invited me. i politely declined because it was hot that day and the lines would be long and at the time i was on acne meds so i couldn’t be in the sun for long. My brothers gf said oh its okay ill pay for u i said thanks but im okay 😄 she kept insisting but i really did not wanna go and my father kept bugging me saying go, go have fun until i finally had enough and said i dont want to go why are you forcing me? and they just stopped ik i was kinda in the wrong for snapping in a way but i did not want to go. (she was only gonna pay for my entrance fee not the food not the tickets for the ride btw at least of what ik) after that my brother and his gf came over (my parents werent home and the house was mess) it was my brothers turn to clean our shareable space and he just kept procrastinating. So i took him to our parents room and in a way yelled at him bc i was embarrassed of the mess and why he brought her here when it was his turn to clean. i also thought because of our house lay out she couldn’t hear what i was telling him.



So couple weeks pass and at this point its a couple days before my moms birthday, my brother leaves to go hangout with his gf, we stay home and after that they both come over. they lowkey caught me by surprise because our dogs didnt bark and they walked in. at the time i was almost helping my mom with something and was lowkey confused.. So they both walk in the gf walks in last i look at the gift i compliment it (it was actually nice tbh) and i was like yoooo???? what’re u guys doing wanna go get 7brew?? they said sure and on the way there the gf was in front, i was driving, my brother was in the back. My mom also wanted us to run an errand near the 7 brew so we got off and after when we were getting into the car i asked my brother if he can sit upfront he said sure and at that point the gf was almost sitting and he said “baby go in the back” she went in the back and i felt bad because my brother was lowkey kinda rude.. After we get to 7brew, and as im ordering i say “hey brothers gf whats ur order” she says “your brother knows what i like” i was oh okay and my brother repeated to me. I paid we left and i was zoned out because i was rethinking of what i said/did to make her mad and i accidentally ignored her when she said thanks. After that i asked her if she can put a specific song because it was stuck in my head (she was connected to bluetooth) she said sure and my brother and i were having a convo about our dad so i turned it down a little to hear my brother bc he talks low and would turn it back up after we were done talking. After We were pulling onto our street and i kept hearing this noise right behind my chair, i asked guys whats that noise behind me? just curious, she replied saying it was a bag to hide the gift she got my mom from her mom i said oh okay and left it at that. We got home, my brother and i got off to give our mom the drinks and i assumed she was coming inside too. She got off the backseat and rushed into the passenger seat. I asked my brother and said shes not coming inside he said no i was like oh okay waved bye and walked inside.


fast forward a couple days my brother gets home after work and says My gf says that if you have a problem with her, text her and that you know her instagram. I was like what happened?? what problems?? 
heres what he said she was complaining about: 
1. Gf said i didn’t want to hangout with them (i previously have) 
2.yelling at him bc our shareable space wasn’t clean and she assumed i was yelling at him because i didnt want her there. 
3. Gf said i looked her up and down when she walked in.
4. gf said i was being rude about the bag that was behind me. 
5. the music being turn down every second i guess 
6. Said i was rude for ignoring her thank you (forgot to add i did reply after i realized she was talking to me) 

So after i found out that she assumed we had a problem i was confused because i don’t remember looking her up and down and was actually really confused and felt bad because i didnt want to make her feel that way. i explained to my brother the situation and my side he was laughing because i told him “what a nitpicker” he said he would talk to her and i guess he did. that happened and i was lowkey annoyed bc she has dm’d me on instagram before and idk why she involved and put my brother in the middle of this??? but afterwards we were cool and would just say hi and stuff. 

So after that situation i realized i never really got an apology for her giving me that weird reply to asking her for her coffee order.. i guess i made faces when she would come over but i would still say hi (i didnt realize till my brother told me today lol) and a week ago my brother and i had these plans on friday at 9 to go somewhere. i asked what time are you getting home?? he said idk damn maybe around 11? i said oh my gosh youre always bailing on me (he has done this to me multiple times and acts stupid when he realizes he “forgets”) so when he got home i said took your sweet ass time he got bothered and left me at home and just left by himself. 


today my brother and i talked about it and were laughing because it was a stupid argument. after we were done laughing he said yk my gf thinks u have youngest child syndrome 😂😂 i was like what??? he said yeah you always want attention. i was confused because when i tag along with them i never really get in between them or try so hard for my brothers attention. i didnt realize at the moment what that meant because no one has ever told me that. I searched it up and got a little offended because im not like that.. i told my brother why would she say that let me say something about her mommy and daddy issues and see what she thinks. he got mad and said yeah no stop. but im thinking about how she says weird shit like this then complains to my brother saying “why doesnt your sister like me🥺🥺🥺??” and also keep in mind i dont say anything rude or attack her personally.. So AITA?? 


Please tell me if i am i will apologize and talk with her but i just need another perspective besides my familys (sorry for it be long and poor grammar currently havent slept bc idk what to do) ",1,1758464431.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Chapter 1 
The click of the penthouse door sent a chill through me before I even looked up. I knew that sound—Julian returning home far too late, his footsteps uneven from expensive whiskey. What I didn't expect was the high-pitched giggle that followed. 
I sat frozen in our living room, my book forgotten in my lap as my husband staggered in with a woman draped across his shoulder. She was tall, impossibly thin, with the kind of angular features that dominated magazine covers. A model—probably from that charity gala he'd claimed was 'just business.' 
""Charlotte,"" Julian drawled, his eyes finding mine with a glint that wasn't just intoxication. It was challenge. Mockery. ""You're still up."" 
The woman—barely older than twenty-five—finally noticed me. Her red-painted lips formed a perfect 'O' of surprise, but not embarrassment. Never that. 
""Oh,"" she giggled again, pressing manicured fingers against Julian's chest. ""You didn't tell me your... housekeeper would be here."" 
The blood in my veins turned to ice. Julian didn't correct her. Instead, his mouth curled into that smirk I'd grown to dread—the one that said I was pathetic for still being here, still hoping. 
""My wife,"" he finally clarified, the word sounding like an inconvenience. ""She's old-fashioned. Doesn't understand how things work in our world."" 
I stood, my legs trembling beneath me. ""Julian, it's nearly three in the morning."" 
""Is it?"" He checked his Rolex with exaggerated movements. ""Time flies when you're actually enjoying yourself, Charlotte."" 
The model snickered, swaying against him. The city lights through our floor-to-ceiling windows caught the diamond pendant nestled between her collarbones—identical to the one Julian had given me for our anniversary three months ago. 
""I think you should leave,"" I said to her, surprised by the steadiness in my voice. 
Julian's eyes narrowed. ""She stays. This is my house, bought with my money."" 
""Our home,"" I corrected, though the word felt hollow now. 
He laughed, the sound cutting through me like shattered glass. ""Go to bed, Charlotte. Or don't. We'll be in the guest room."" 
I watched them stumble down the hallway, her whispers and his low chuckles echoing off the marble floors. I didn't cry. That well had run dry months ago. 
--- 
Morning light streamed through the windows, harsh and unforgiving. Julian had left early—a meeting in Midtown, according to the terse note on the counter. The model was gone too, leaving behind only the faint scent of an unfamiliar perfume. 
I made coffee, my movements mechanical. When Julian's phone buzzed on the kitchen island, I shouldn't have looked. But something in me needed the confirmation, needed to see the truth I'd been avoiding. 
The notification preview showed just enough: 
*Savannah Moore: Can't wait for this weekend. My place this time? Less complicated than...* 
His executive assistant. Of course. I unlocked his phone—he'd never bothered changing the code, so confident was he in my submission—and scrolled through dozens of messages between them. Pet names. Plans. Photos I immediately wished I could unsee. 
Savannah wasn't just another fling. This had been going on for months, right under my nose. At company events where I'd smiled politely at her. During late nights at the office he'd claimed were unavoidable. 
I set the phone down, hands shaking. The diamond wedding ring on my finger caught the light, mocking me with its empty promises. I'd tried so hard—therapy appointments Julian never showed up for, weekend getaways he canceled last-minute, desperate attempts to recapture what we'd once had. 
That night, he returned home sober and immaculate in his tailored suit. I'd prepared dinner—a peace offering, a last attempt. 
""We need to talk,"" I said as he loosened his tie. 
Julian sighed, impatient. ""About what? Last night? Don't be dramatic, Charlotte."" 
""About us. About what's left of our marriage."" 
He studied me for a moment, then reached for his wine glass. ""I've been thinking about that, actually. I think we should consider an open marriage."" 
The words hit me like a physical blow. ""What?"" 
""It's the modern solution,"" he continued, casual as if discussing stock options. ""You get the security you crave, I get my freedom. Everyone wins."" 
""That's not a marriage,"" I whispered. 
Julian's expression hardened. ""It's all I'm offering. Take it or leave it, Charlotte."" His smile turned cruel. ""Though we both know you have nowhere else to go."" 
He stood, conversation finished in his mind, and walked toward the guest bedroom without waiting for my response. I watched his silhouette disappear down the hallway, the set of his shoulders radiating absolute certainty in his control over me. 
In that moment, something inside me—something I thought Julian had crushed years ago—quietly stirred to life. He was right about one thing: I had nowhere to go. 
But that was about to change.
Chapter 2 
The therapist's office felt like a cage—plush, beige, and suffocating. Dr. Winters sat across from us, her expression professionally neutral as she glanced between Julian and me. The ticking of the wall clock punctuated the silence. 
""So, Charlotte,"" Dr. Winters began, ""you mentioned feeling invisible in your marriage. Can you elaborate on that?"" 
I inhaled deeply, gathering courage. ""It's like I've become furniture in our home. Something Julian walks past without seeing."" My voice wavered. ""The affairs, the lies—they've been going on for years, but lately, he doesn't even try to hide them."" 
The soft glow of Julian's phone illuminated his face as his thumbs moved rapidly across the screen. He hadn't looked up once since we'd sat down. 
""Julian?"" Dr. Winters prompted. ""What are your thoughts on what Charlotte just shared?"" 
He sighed dramatically, glancing up with undisguised boredom. ""I think Charlotte needs to join the twenty-first century. Most successful couples in our circle have arrangements."" 
""Arrangements are agreed upon,"" I countered, heat rising to my cheeks. ""Not forced on someone who's begging for basic respect."" 
Julian finally pocketed his phone, leaning forward with a practiced smile—the same one he used for business negotiations. ""Dr. Winters, my wife has very... traditional expectations. But surely you understand that in today's world, especially for someone in my position—"" 
""Your position doesn't exempt you from fidelity, Julian,"" I interrupted, surprising myself with my firmness. 
Julian's eyes narrowed briefly before he turned to Dr. Winters. His posture shifted subtly, shoulders relaxing as he tilted his head. ""You know, Doctor, you remind me of someone I met at the Guggenheim fundraiser last month. Same insightful eyes."" 
The therapist blinked, momentarily caught off guard by the abrupt change in tone. ""Let's stay focused on—"" 
""Harvard, right?"" Julian continued, his voice dropping to that intimate register he used when pursuing a new conquest. ""I can always spot fellow alumni. Class of...?"" 
I watched in silent horror as Dr. Winters—our third therapist this year—unconsciously touched her hair, her professional demeanor faltering under Julian's practiced charm. 
""Mr. Carter, I'd prefer we redirect to—"" 
""Julian, please,"" he insisted, flashing that million-dollar smile. ""And I'd love to hear your professional opinion on whether emotional needs should really trump individual freedom in modern marriages."" 
Tears burned behind my eyes as I realized what was happening. Again. I gathered my purse and stood. 
""Charlotte?"" Dr. Winters looked startled. 
""Session's over,"" I managed, walking out before either could see me break. 
--- 
Eleanor Carter's dining room gleamed with old money and new resentment. Crystal chandeliers cast a harsh light over the mahogany table where Julian's family gathered for their monthly dinner. I sat stiffly beside my husband, who hadn't spoken directly to me since the therapy disaster three days ago. 
""Savannah has been absolutely revolutionary for the company,"" Eleanor announced, beaming at Julian's executive assistant seated across from me. ""The Wang acquisition wouldn't have happened without her extraordinary efforts."" 
Savannah lowered her eyes in practiced modesty. ""It was all Julian's vision. I just executed the details."" 
I stared at my untouched salmon, acutely aware of the matching diamond pendants around both our necks. 
""Charlotte,"" Eleanor's voice cut through my thoughts, ""have you considered doing... something? A hobby, perhaps? You look rather... stagnant."" 
The table fell silent. Julian sipped his wine, watching the exchange with detached amusement. 
""I've been taking photography classes,"" I replied quietly. 
Eleanor's perfectly sculpted eyebrow arched. ""How quaint. Though I imagine it's difficult to capture anything of substance when one rarely leaves the apartment."" 
Julian chuckled, the sound slicing through me like a blade. 
""Unlike our Savannah,"" Eleanor continued, reaching over to pat the younger woman's hand. ""Twenty-eight and already making such an impact. Youth and ambition—such a powerful combination."" 
Savannah smiled, her eyes flicking to mine with barely concealed triumph. Under the table, her foot brushed against Julian's. 
I excused myself to the bathroom, locking the door behind me before pressing my forehead against the cool marble wall. In the mirror, a pale stranger stared back at me, her eyes hollow with resignation. 
When I returned, Julian was showing something on his phone to Savannah, both of them laughing. He quickly darkened the screen when I approached. 
That night, preparing for bed, I discovered an unfamiliar app on my phone. Clicking through its settings revealed what I'd suspected: tracking software, monitoring my location, messages, even recording capabilities. 
""Julian,"" I confronted him in his home office, holding up my phone. ""What is this?"" 
He barely glanced up from his laptop. ""What's what?"" 
""The spyware on my phone. Are you tracking me?"" 
Julian laughed, the sound devoid of humor. ""Don't be paranoid, Charlotte. That's a security feature. For your protection."" 
""My protection? Or your surveillance?"" 
He finally looked at me, his eyes cold. ""If you have nothing to hide, why would it bother you?"" 
As I turned to leave, I caught his reflection in the window—a small, satisfied smile playing on his lips as he watched me go. 
That night, lying alone in what was once our bedroom, I made a decision. Julian thought he owned me—my past, present, and future. 
He was wrong.
Chapter 3 
I stared at the small diamond earring nestled in my palm, its facets catching the morning light streaming through our bedroom window. It wasn't mine. The delicate stud had been half-hidden under our bedspread when I'd stripped the sheets, a glittering betrayal against the Egyptian cotton. 
Julian's earring. Savannah's ear. 
My stomach clenched as I recognized it—identical to the pair she'd worn at Eleanor's dinner party last week, when she'd leaned in too close to Julian, laughing at his jokes with practiced adoration while I sat forgotten across the table. 
I waited in the living room, the earring burning a hole in my pocket. When Julian finally came home that evening, loosening his tie as he strode through the door, I approached him with a calmness that surprised even me. 
""I found something today,"" I said, holding out my palm to reveal the diamond stud. 
Julian barely glanced at it before his eyes met mine, not a flicker of shame or remorse crossing his face. Instead, his lips curled into that familiar smirk that made my skin crawl. 
""At least this time it was someone worth looking at,"" he said, the casual cruelty in his voice stealing my breath. ""You should thank me for my discretion. Most men would have left by now."" 
Something inside me—something that had been bending for years—finally snapped. 
""I'm moving into the guest room,"" I said, my voice steady despite the trembling in my hands. 
Julian laughed, the sound hollow and mocking. ""By all means. It's not like we've shared a bed in months anyway."" He plucked the earring from my palm. ""I'll return this to Savannah. She was quite upset about losing it."" 
I turned away before he could see the tears threatening to spill. I wouldn't give him that satisfaction. 
The guest room felt both foreign and familiar as I began transferring my clothes from our shared closet. Each armful represented another piece of our marriage dissolving, another admission that what we once had was irretrievably lost. The weight of it—years of memories, broken promises, and humiliation—suddenly crashed over me. 
My knees hit the carpet as the first sob escaped, then another, until I was gasping for breath between waves of grief. Not for Julian—I'd mourned him long ago—but for the woman I'd been before him, for the family I'd lost twice over. 
A soft knock at the door barely registered through my tears. 
""Mrs. Hayes?"" 
Elena stood in the doorway, her kind eyes taking in the scene without judgment—me kneeling on the floor surrounded by scattered clothes, mascara streaking down my cheeks. Our housekeeper had been with me since before Julian, one of the few constants in my unraveling life. 
She disappeared briefly, returning with a steaming cup of chamomile tea and something tucked under her arm. Without a word, she helped me to the edge of the bed and pressed the warm mug into my hands. 
""Drink,"" she said softly. ""It helps."" 
As I sipped the tea, Elena placed a worn shoebox beside me. ""I saved these when you were... clearing things out last year,"" she explained, her accent thickening with emotion. ""I thought someday you might want them back."" 
Inside were photographs—my parents laughing on our sailboat, me graduating from high school, family Christmases from before the bankruptcy. Fragments of a life Julian had convinced me to pack away because they ""cluttered his aesthetic."" 
""He has no right to treat you this way,"" Elena whispered, her voice barely audible. ""The games he plays... You deserve better."" 
The simple validation—the first I'd heard in so long—brought fresh tears to my eyes. 
""Thank you,"" I managed, clutching one of the photographs to my chest. 
Elena squeezed my shoulder before quietly leaving me with my memories and my tea. 
Three days later, Mia's text arrived like a thunderbolt: 
*Are you okay? Julian called. Said you've been having episodes. Why didn't you tell me things were so bad?* 
My fingers froze over the screen. Episodes? I hadn't spoken to Julian about Mia in weeks. 
I called her immediately, but her voice was guarded, distant. ""Charlotte, I'm worried about you. Julian says you've been unstable, that you're imagining things about him and Savannah."" 
""That's not true,"" I insisted, panic rising in my throat. ""He's lying, Mia. He's trying to isolate me."" 
""He's concerned,"" she countered. ""He suggested you might need... professional help. More than just couples therapy."" 
""You believe him? After everything I've told you?"" 
The silence on the other end was deafening. 
""I think you both need space,"" she finally said. ""Call me when you're feeling more... yourself."" 
The line went dead, and with it, my last lifeline to the world outside Julian's control. I stared at my phone in disbelief, watching as my oldest friendship slipped through my fingers like sand. 
In the reflection of the darkened screen, I hardly recognized myself anymore.
Chapter 4 
I couldn't breathe. The penthouse walls seemed to close in on me, each gilded surface reflecting back my isolation. After Mia's betrayal, I felt utterly alone—Julian had successfully poisoned my last meaningful connection outside his carefully constructed world. 
I needed air. Space. Something real.

Alt text: Professional business people discussing at a meeting table, Bahrain Financial Harbour backdrop.?** Because Bahrain is a leader in FinTech innovation in the Gulf, and the regulatory environment is increasingly high-stakes. According to 2025 data from Forbes Business and Reuters, Bahrain’s digital economy is projected to grow over 12% this year—driven by strict, fast-evolving payment regulations.\
Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: Opportunity and Regulatory Precision\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Bay towers and sleek corporate offices. reports indicate GDP growth rates topping 4.1% in early 2025, with the financial sector (including digital payments) leading the charge. The Economic Development Board (EDB) expects foreign direct investment to reach BHD 1.1 billion this year, with strong push from digital-first companies.\
However, business here is personal. Whether you’re in a glass-walled office in Bahrain Bay or hosting Ramadan-adjusted client meetings in the Diplomatic Area, connections matter. There’s no substitute for understanding local customs, like sending a WhatsApp ahead to confirm an appointment or observing the unspoken rules of coffee etiquette during negotiations.\
\
“Bahrain’s business culture rewards patience, respect for tradition, and absolute regulatory compliance. The risk of penalties for non-compliance—especially around digital payments—is simply too high to gamble.”\
\
The government has invested heavily in a stable legal framework. Regulatory zones like Bahrain Free Zones and streamlined registration via MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism) and Sijilat make company formation smooth—if you follow the rules.\
Digital Payment Regulations in Bahrain: 2025 Updates and Implementation\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, digital compliance audit in Bahrain office. now requires ALL registered businesses (including startups with eCommerce or POS systems) to use only CBB-approved digital payment systems. This includes real-time reporting, mandatory transaction encryption, and full KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance—rolling out from March 1, 2025.\
\
Statutory KYC/AML Controls: Every transaction above BHD 1,000 must be flagged and reported, with automated anti-money-laundering (AML) screening.\
Mandatory Integration: Businesses have until September 30, 2025 to fully integrate approved payment platforms or face penalties.\
E-Invoice Requirements: All digital transactions must generate e-invoices, linked in real time to MOICT’s Sijilat system.\
\
Failure to meet these standards isn’t just a small paperwork hiccup—it’s a major risk.\
What Penalties Apply for Non-Compliance with Digital Payment Requirements?\
1. Fines & Monetary Penalties\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, digital penalty calculation for Bahraini businesses..\
2. Business License Suspension or Revocation\
The MOICT and CBB coordinate closely. If your company repeatedly fails digital payment audits or ignores KYC mandates:\
\
Immediate suspension of your Commercial Registration (CR) is possible.\
For severe cases, full license revocation can be imposed, which halts all operations and payroll through LMRA.\
\
3. Legal Action and Criminal Liability\
Where willful evasion or fraudulent activity is found, particularly relating to money laundering or terrorist financing:\
\
Senior managers and owners can be personally liable—including jail time (1-5 years) and asset freezing.\
Names are published in the Bahrain Government Gazette, which can destroy your reputation overnight.\
\
4. Reputational Damage\
Surprisingly, the fastest way to get blacklisted by payment gateways or banking partners is a compliance failure. Your business could end up on industry watchlists, essentially locking you out of Bahrain’s lucrative financial ecosystem.\
5. Customer and Partner Loss\
Many local partners screen for regulatory history before entering a joint venture. A compliance mark can end future deals.\
How to Avoid Penalties: Practical, Step-by-Step Insider Guidance\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, paperwork and e-invoice compliance in Bahrain. to pick the best fit. For instance:\
\
Single Person Company (SPC): Fastest to set up, favored by freelancers but strictest on transaction monitoring.\
WLLs and BSCs: Better for scaling digital transactions, offer more buffer for compliance processes.\
\
Step 2: Register on Sijilat and MOICT\
Beat the queues—apply online at Sijilat before 9:30 AM to be first in the processing order. Prepare:\
\
Passport copies (scan in color, 300dpi—saves rejection risk!)\
Lease agreement for the office (Seef District offices tend to get faster approvals due to proximity to government buildings)\
Digital constative documents (PDF format,  In one memorable meeting at Bahrain Bay, a simple misstep—checking my phone during an elder’s coffee service—nearly cost me a deal. That same business partner later helped fast-track my compliance submission at MOICT.\
\
Comparing Bahrain to UAE and Saudi Arabia: Regulatory Advantages\
Bahrain stands out for transparency and accessibility. Unlike the UAE, which often requires a local sponsor (unless you're in a Free Zone), or Saudi Arabia, where processes are opaque and slow, Bahrain gives:\
\
99%+ Foreign Ownership on most activities\
No need for a local partner for most businesses (see activities list)\
Faster regulatory approval and lower overall costs\
\
Bahrain’s EDB and Tamkeen provide practical support—one call to an EDB advisor in the Diplomatic Area once solved a compliance challenge for me in 24 hours.\
2025 Regulatory Change: Practical Impact\
The 2025 CBB mandate for real-time e-invoicing requires EVERY company to sync with Sijilat. Miss integration by September 30, and you’ll be unable to process digital sales. That’s not just a fine—it’s operational paralysis.\
I recommend working with KeyLink: their digital onboarding service is the easiest way (and yes, they helped me clear a messy backlog last year).\
Common Mistake: Underestimating Documentation Time\
The biggest error? Relying on last-minute document prep, especially during Eid or Ramadan. I've seen companies hit with BHD 5,000+ in fines simply because their KYC forms weren't translated or notarized in time. Pre-schedule all compliance calendar dates and use digital reminders.\

Brief Tangent: Why Bahrain’s Tech Scene Loves October\
Odd aside—October is peak digital event season. Bahrain Tech Week brings together CBB officials, payment providers, and FinTech founders. Attending these events not only helps with networking but often provides direct regulatory Q&As, letting you avoid costly compliance guesswork. That’s how I first learned about the CBB’s 2025 e-invoice pilot—months before the public mandate.\
FAQ: Bahrain Digital Payment Compliance\
Q1: Can I delegate digital payment compliance to a third party?\
Yes, but ultimate liability rests with your company directors. Use trusted local accounting firms like those listed here.\
Q2: What documents are required for CBB registration?\
Prepare Trade License, Sijilat CR, office lease, KYC forms, and digital signatures. All must be notarized and translated.\
Q3: How long does digital payment compliance setup take?\
2-4 weeks—faster if all documents are digitally scanned and submitted early morning at MOICT.\
Q4: Are there payment compliance differences in Free Zones?\
Free Zones require CBB-approved gateways just like the mainland, but setup may be faster due to dedicated business support.\
Q5: What’s the best advice for foreign founders?\
Build relationships, plan your compliance calendar around Ramadan and local holidays, and always double-check translations. Engage a formation consultant early to avoid hidden pitfalls.\

1nmt3a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1nmt3a4/i_stopped_wasting_5_mins_on_mac_every_time_i_plug/,I stopped wasting 5 mins on Mac every time I plug in monitors. One keyboard shortcut.,"I go from my laptop at coffee shops to my big monitor at home and back all the time. And Mac insists on not putting the windows back where they belong.

For years I've tried the manual tools for years (e.g. SizeUp, Rectangle, etc) but you still have to go through windows one at a time and move them, and I usually have 50+ windows up.

Wanted something with some scriptability but that I could control, and found hammerspoon to give me a very lightweight scripting tool where I could push one keyboard command and it would go through all my windows and put them where i wanted them.

A little Claude Code and their Lua script and it was in place. I'll post the script I use down below in case anyone wants it unless it is better to link out to a separate file.

Specifically what it does is:

* Detects how many monitors i have connected
* Moves and resizes windows in different apps to certain width/height (e.g. Safari centered 80% width when on laptop and 60% when on secondary big screen)
* Hotkey to reapply all if things get messed up

To get it working:

1. Install Hammerspoon from [hammerspoon.org](http://hammerspoon.org/) and turn on the accessibility permissions it needs.
2. Create \~/.hammerspoon/init.lua ; you can do that from their dropdown.
3. Paste in the script below, then click “Reload Config” from their menu.
4. Command-option-control-z is what i use, but you can use whatever you want.

Script:

    -- Move and resize a window
    function moveAndResizeApp(appName, targetScreen, widthRatio, heightRatio)

This is art made for me what you think?  
**Elias Raven** is a Kiasyd who remembers almost nothing of his mortal life—only the taste of alcohol, the smell of coffee, the clinking of glass, and the murmur of voices in a bar. His past with the Sabbat earned him the nickname *Raven*, for he scavenged from the dead and was always surrounded by his black birds.

Eventually he abandoned the sect, restored a forgotten building, and opened the **Raven Nest**—a café that blends his faint mortal memories with his passion for knowledge. By day mortals run the place; by night Elias studies among books and ravens. Few know of the secret basement where he conducts darker experiments.

Now aligned with the **Camarilla**, Elias struggles to prove his loyalty under the watchful eye of the Prince. He has begun to rebuild his humanity, combining his mortal name with his Sabbat moniker to forge a new self.

At his side is **Bailey**, a young occult enthusiast he hired to run the café. Loyal yet unaware of the truth, she has become a shadow of the humanity Elias both longs for and fears. He often wonders if she should become his ghoul—or even his Childe.",13,1758464053.0,vtm,0,1.0,False
1nmt291,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmt291,"Big Open Kitchen: What's missing? How's the zoning? Plus, plenty of hyper specific design questions!","Hello Reddit! Earlier this year, I posted the first phase of our kitchen redesign on this sub ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1if87yh/how_to_redesign_our_big_and_weirdly_empty_kitchen/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) and got tons of really, really helpful advice and suggestions. Thank you DesignMyRoom <3  We are now entering into Phase 2 (or 3?) of this reno. While I welcome any and all general advice and suggestions, I also have plenty of specific questions below, so take your pick!

**Disclaimers:**  
\* Whoever designed this kitchen basically went with the cheapest and smallest kitchenette cabinets at Home Depot they could find. It is not within our budget to fully renovate, which is unfortunate given the size of this kitchen, the height of the ceilings, and the potential it could have (plus I hate the corner sink lol). That being said, improvement upon the current layout / cabinets is in the cards.  
\* The current picture hanging layout is not final and is going to be scrapped: we just don't want to put more nails in the wall until we land on a final layout for the kitchen. So right now, yes, I realize they're kind of all over the place!  
\* We live in Chicago, and our design aesthetic matches that: Chicago tavern style, a lil MCM, a lil art deco (and a lil ""I have a flower drying hobby""). If flow between our kitchen and living room matters: We had a custom built in done by an amazing local craftsman who featured it on their IG ([link](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLIVsBaOJ3A/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=c2gxaHR6ZGJva3Rr)), in case you want to see what our living room vibe looks like.

**Specific (and hyper-specific) questions:**

1. **Rugs!** It's rug time baby! But, I know I'd like an area rug under the dining table, I'd also like a runner (or two?) in here, too. And if I'm able to zone in a small seating area, does that have a rug, too? Kind of stuck on how many rugs / what sizes.
2. **Sightline:** As you can see, this kitchen has a lot of beautiful potential with the giant windows, but I'm wondering if I'm not taking the best advantage of the sightline. The last picture is taken from the entry into the kitchen: the kitchen table being centered with the windows kind of disrupts the sightline upon entry, but does that matter? This brings me to my next question.
3. **Layout / zoning:** You guys advocated on the last post for a seating area given the space I have, and now that I got this little settee, I love it and want to expand upon it! But where can I put/ zone in a lounge area? I'm open to buying another couple chairs, small coffee table, or whatever it takes to make it feel fully realized. But with the kitchen table currently where it is (centered with the windows), there's not really room for it anywhere other than the long empty wall (second to last picture).
4. **Cabinet refacing / expansion / etc:** Given my disclaimer about not being able to fully renovate, how can we improve on what we have? The cabinets could use refacing (they're chipping paint), I could use a pantry, and I hate that they leave 2 ft between them and the high ceiling. Is there a <$5k fix for this? And if not, a <$10k solution?
5. **Big Empty Wall:** I asked about this in my last post. The Big Empty Wall is best viewed in the second to last picture. I believe the kitchen was zoned for the area below the window to be the eating area (there's a ceiling thingy for a chandelier above it). I love this glass brick window: what should I do with this area? How can I accentuate or build upon it? Right now, it's my coffee corner (coffee cart + settee). Open to any and all ideas.
6. **Tree:** Yes, tree. It's our plan to invest a big ass ficus or something to put in here. Could go where the ZZ plant currently is, or the corner where the lamp is. We have 2 cats so that's a consideration. We've got a couple of great garden stores in the city to hit up, but if you have specific indoor tree / plant suggestions, send em our way!
7. **Piano:** I play piano. We've also toyed with the idea of putting an upright piano in here, as we don't have the space anywhere else in the house. Nothing fancy (I recognize kitchen wear and tear isn't great for pianos)– I'm talking about just one of the gazillion ones that are available for free on Craigslist every weekend. Is this an insane idea, or a fun idea?
8. **Backsplash:** I know we need backsplash, but I don't even know where to start. Any suggestions?
9. **Paint:** I dream about painting this kitchen with lime wash (right now it's a very ugly white color that's chipping all over the place) but very much want to stick with a light and neutral color. Any suggestions?
10. **Lighting:** Once we land on zoning, we're going to need better lighting. The current galley lights can be so intense, so I actually removed the bulbs in the middle section. Open to any and all suggestions here that don't require an electrician to do new stuff.
11. **Sideboard? Buffet with hutch?:** I've looked into buffets with hutches, but we haven't landed on anything we're willing to pull the trigger on. With some of the hutches I have found, I'm wondering how they would look given the height of our ceilings. I feel like the room could use something big, but what?
12. **Glassware display:** We have a lot of gorgeous glassware I've collected over the years and no current way to display, so they're all hidden away in the cabinets. Any ideas for bringing these out? Should I do a floating shelf above or near the bar area?  Or, given my previous question, should I invest in a furniture piece that would  solve this problem?
13. **Window treatment:** I don't want to block any of the natural light that comes in through these windows, but I do realize that they probably could use some framing. Do I get curtains? A valence? TBH, not willing to invest too much in a proper window treatment installation, as there is some leftover wood rot in the top frame of these windows (we have new lintels now!) that will one day down the road get addressed.",3,1758464035.0,DesignMyRoom,8,1.0,False
