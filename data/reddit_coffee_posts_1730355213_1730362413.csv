If it helps anyone, here is what I am doing:

1- calculate the amount of your target calories per day: measure your BMR, assess your level of activity and therefore your baseline daily energy  (for sedentary 0.2xBMR), set a target weight and date, and knowing that 1kg requires around 7,700 kcal deficit, plan out the deficit per day. 

In my case I started out at 67.5 and set out a target of 58 with a target date of Dec 15. My goal was to lose 0.8kg per week so thats a deficit of 880. My BMR is 1350, considering a sedentary lifestyle with 270, subtracting my deficit, my taregt calories is 747. 

I only eat two meals, so this works fine with me. Breakfast:
2 scrambled eggs (with spray oil)
1.5 whole grain bread slices
0.5 cup low fat milk for coffee 
Lunch:
Around a 400 kcal plate varies by day
0.5 protein bar
Dinner:
1 Cup Yogurt (optional)

2- Tracking everything is the trick here. I record my calories intake in comparison to my energy consumption, I use cronometer and its perfect for tracking both and adapting to exercise. I also use apple watch, health app, zones app, and my fat percentage scale app to monitor my body composition. Be mindful that nutrition labels for food are +/- 20% in accuracy and calorie tracker overestimate calories burnt. I personally stick to my target calories despite also exercise to account for the lack of accuracy.

3- To put my metabolism into burn mode, I exercise for 40 minutes in day. Since I am a PhD and have limited time, I try to make exercise more natural by walking to campus and coming back to my apartment twice a day (40 minutes in total). I monitor my heart rate and increase my speed accordingly to remain in the fat burn or cardio zone. Again zones is a great app to set an exercise weekly target minutes. 

I hope this is helpful to anyone out there, please AMA :)",1,1730362125.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

1gg9a4e,https://i.redd.it/ls9gqlmxs1yd1.jpeg,TREAT YOUR CHANNELS LIKE KIDS,"I see a lot of people comparing their new channels to others, asking how to keep up. I’m a one man show and have tackled 7 channels today and every day before it. I rarely get out of the house anymore while I’m growing these, I don’t go party, my wife currently hates me lol, but loves me, and I’ve had to isolate myself from my friends. I wake up everyday at 5am, shower, coffee and I’m in bed no earlier than midnight every night. I take a walk here and there around the house to try and keep my physique lol, but other than that, I’m glued to my editing room. If you want to do YouTube full time, you have to understand THAT’S THE LEVEL of commitment it will take 99% of the time with only a small chance of it taking less time if you’re lucky. But rarely are people lucky. 

But I’m tired of people telling others they can’t do it, you can’t keep up, you can’t do daily videos, you can’t possibly expect grand results from quantity over quality, or if you do daily you can’t possibly have quality. You need to compromise somewhere in the middle and it will pay off. If you’re doing a passion project then don’t be upset if I don’t take off and make you rich. If you want to YouTube full time like I am, then make videos you know people will love and don’t put time into passion projects until AFTER you made a couple big channels for others. Then those people will follow you to your passion project. 

I upload 7 videos every day across 7 channels lol. So it's not unheard of. Some people just need to sit back and find the system and tools that work for them. Enjoy the process of developing your system but never ever tell people daily is not in reach. It definitely is within reach and really depends on the style of content. I'll edit one full video and be able to rearrange it with new results SEVEN times to develop seven videos, each with their own results. It is possible but if you plan complex videos then obviously you'll be looking at a very long complex start. But everyone has a chance. I learned Youtube only a year ago and l've monetized 7 channels within weeks each. I'm starting another on the first to see the latest I can monetize a channel with a daily commitment. By January I'll finally need to hire someone because I want 15 channels up and producing before June. I sleep very little and my very uninspired daughter (just not her thing lol) helps me with about an hour a day's worth of help uploading and titling.

MY ADVICE:

Every single day, or video, look at what you did and determine, what can I take, that I did on this from this video and streamline for the next one? Something that took too long, anything. Streamline that one thing. After 6 months of this, oil have developed a crazy system tailored to you that no course will ever be able to teach you.

I started probably after everyone here. And was able to quit my job within 4 weeks of starting. Just know you’ll not be able to sleep while trying, if you’re planning to do it right, you’ll have to really truly learn between every video you make how to shave off 10% of time to make the next one. Especially in the beginning. If you spend days making a video, then expect your growth to be slow and painful. Not impossible, but YouTube wants good videos daily to explode your channels within weeks rather than months or years. If you’re a year into a channel and not monetized then when you do get monetized don’t expect anything substantial. If YouTube wants to pay you the algorithm will find you within weeks and get you there. They want partners who produce what people are looking for. The passion projects here and there are good. But that’s not a big segment of the successes. ",0,1730361432.0,SmallYoutubers,2,0.5,False
1gg99w0,https://i.redd.it/ldn0zxvts1yd1.jpeg,The Power of a Simple Act: How One Kind Gesture Changed My Life (OC),"

We've all heard the saying, ""A small act of kindness can change the world."" But how often do we really believe it? I used to think these were just empty words until one unexpected moment transformed my perspective. Here’s my story.

It was a typical Tuesday morning, and I was running late for work, feeling the weight of deadlines and responsibilities. My morning coffee run turned chaotic when I discovered I’d forgotten my wallet. Stressed and embarrassed, I turned to leave the café when a stranger tapped me on the shoulder.

This man, probably in his late 30s, offered to pay for my coffee. I was taken aback; I hesitated, but he insisted with a warm smile. It was just a few dollars, yet in that moment, it felt like so much more. I thanked him profusely, and we struck up a brief conversation about life and stress.

After that encounter, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude. Inspired, I decided to pay it forward. Later that week, I bought lunch for a coworker who was going through a tough time. This small act sparked a chain reaction. My coworker started bringing in treats for the office, and soon others joined in, creating a wave of positivity.

What I learned from that simple coffee gesture was profound. Kindness can be contagious. It doesn’t take much to make someone’s day, and these small moments can lead to greater connections and community. 

I challenge everyone reading this to perform one small act of kindness this week. Whether it’s buying coffee for the person behind you, leaving a note of encouragement for a friend, or simply smiling at a stranger, you have the power to create a ripple effect. Let’s make kindness the norm and see how it transforms our lives and those around us.

","Hey guys, I (28M) want to share some thoughts about my relationship with my girlfriend (25F) that have been weighing on me lately. We’ve been together for over four years, having met in college back in 2020. In the beginning, everything felt perfect—full of butterflies and excitement. I truly believed we were meant to be together, and our future looked bright. However, things took a turn about two years in. I started taking advantage of her and be mean, often making dumbshit comments like, “You should go to the gym more often or you look like you're gaining some weight.” It kinda created a rift between us, and ultimately, it led to a painful breakup. Unfortunately, during this time, one of my close friends—let’s call him Craig—became involved. Craig is the kind of guy who turns heads—6'4"", fit, and running his own successful café. He and my girlfriend began secretly chatting on social media, and she would often pop into his café for coffee, deepening their connection. Eventually, he convinced her to end things with me, and I later discovered that she emotionally cheated on me with him. They met up secretly metup 2-3 times during our relationship, but no physical intimacy occurred YET. Learning about this was devastating; it felt like a betrayal from both of them. It sent me into a downward spiral, and I ultimately cut both of them out of my life completely. To add to the pain, many of my friends told me they had seen them out together, holding hands and on dates, which only deepened my heartbreak. Fast forward five months, and I unexpectedly ran into her. We had a deep, honest conversation about our lives, where she expressed a lot of regret over her choices and her feelings for Craig. Despite my lingering feelings for her (even after the whole situation), we decided to start fresh as friends. This separation forced me to reflect on my behavior, and I realized I needed to change if I ever wanted to be the partner she truly deserved. After about three months of rebuilding our friendship, we naturally grew closer and decided to give our relationship another shot. It was extremely tough (even now) —my friends and family were strongly against my decision, often labeling me as weak and the c word. Those comments made me feel incredibly insecure about our relationship (even now) , especially when we were out in public. Now, two years later, I can say our relationship is in a much better place. We’ve worked through many of our issues and even traveled around Asia. However, there’s still one lingering concern: she wants to get married soon. While I love her and see a future together, I often find myself struggling with memories of her past disloyalty. I also feel embarrassed around my friends, who still hold negative opinions about her based on what happened. The thought of getting married feels daunting because of these fears and the insecurities I can’t seem to shake even though part of me wants to marry her. I want to move forward and build a future together, but I’m grappling with doubts that keep resurfacing every now and then. How can I work through these feelings of embarrassment from my friends & family and past trauma? I genuinely want to take the next step in our relationship, but I need advice on how to navigate these challenges. ",1,1730360255.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Im so sick of being fake and nice and spending more time to pretend im working rather than working.

Ive also worked private before, cafes, sales, cleaning, etc. 

But then youre dealing with crazy mangers, unreliable hours and start finish/ times.

Why is it any job with any sense of purpose or security is completely useless to myself? I cant buy a house as a barista. 

Instead i sit at a desk, putting some useless notes onto different files, bored out of my friggin brain for 40 hours a week. 

I earn close to 100k (still cant buy a house) but im in agony with how boring it is.  

I go back to making coffees and im choosing to voluntarily bankrupt myself. 

Im really at a loss.

I miss being homeless because i felt like i had so much more purpose. I was homeless for a couple of months and it was never boring (coming up with ways to find food, shelter, showers, etc.)

Im so confused because why am i happier being homeless than working full time?

If i had the capital to do something myself id do it in a heartbeat, but no matter the job i cant raise enough capital to do anything. If i work full time i cant be homeless as being homeless is a full time job within itself, but then my income isnt enough to raise any capital. Its this vicious non stop cycle of nothingness.

I should mention i suffer with some type of ADHD (not diagnosed) and may not even be anything but I REALLY struggle with not moving my body. I like to move my body constantly (which is why barista work works perfectly, but had to give it up due to low income)

I also struggle with chronic insomnia and barely sleep and need a few sick days.

What do i do?

What can i do?

But I'm not sad, or feel bad about myself, or want to die. Yet I hit all the other criteria to the max. (Mandatory: This is *not* asking for diagnosis or medical advice.)

I have a history of very severe depression. I used to contemplate suicide every minute of every hour of every day. I turned down a scholarship university offer, because I'd found a great spot for suicide there when they flew me out and in some lucid moment realized I'd die if I attended. I've had a lot of mild attempts and a few serious attempts. It's only through my past therapists' negligence and apathy that I was never hospitalized.

That's all in the past. I got myself out of suicidal thinking years ago, on my own, which is something I'm proud of. But all the traumas before and since have still stayed with me.

I thought I knew my depression very well, and that my depression was gone with the suicidality. I never feel down, hopeless, worthless or suicidal like I used to every day. I have a great sense of self-worth—maybe even too much. But I always feel tired and unmotivated, almost never eat, sleep 2 hours or 12, can't concentrate, and still harm myself.

I think I've suppressed some of these other symptoms by intensely pursuing my career. Working hard, skipping meals and downing 6 coffees a day were the norm, and I thought these symptoms were just the consequence. But now I've had a chance to slow down and I'm still noticing them, if not more.

As long as he's taking his medication and not drinking alcohol he's relatively normal; he still believes he's correct about all the schizophrenic delusions but he doesn't dwell on it and is able to live a relatively normal life. Sometimes though he goes to the pub, and he'll go every night for a week or two, to play pool, and while he's there he'll drink copious amounts of alcohol, and if someone there offers him weed when he's drunk he'll smoke that too. Then he goes on a schizophrenic spiral that can last days, weeks or sometimes even months.

He's in such a spiral now and it's the worst one I've seen since he was sectioned around 10 years ago. He's convinced that he doesn't actually have schizophrenia, that it's all a government plot to discredit him because he saw something he shouldn't have seen when he was in a mental institution 30 years ago (He thinks he wandered in to a secret room and Hitler was being kept there). Ever since then the government have been giving him different medication to make him crazy so nobody will ever believe what he saw.

He came to my house last night near midnight, woke me up, came in all excited telling me he's figured out how the government are making him crazy, pulled a handfull of cigarette butts out of his pocket and showed me that the filters weren't yellow enough, which proves that the government had taken the nicotine out of them and replaced it with crazy juice. Then he disappeared into the night to get more coffee, even though he hasn't slept for three days now.

He also believes his dad and his brother killed and buried people (they didn't, neither of them were/are bright enough to ever get away with it, and besides the family DNA is on file because he did a DNA test some years ago to prove he's adopted. It proved he wasn't adopted but he believes that's a conspiracy too.) Every time he goes out he thinks he hears people talking about how he's gay and/or a paedophile (he isn't either of those things), and when I'm with him and I ask him why he can hear it but I can't he says it's because he has superhuman hearing and can hear things other people can't. He also believes the other reason the government is doing all this to discredit him is because he has in his mind the blueprints for terrible weapons AND the cure for many cancers, and the government want to keep him crazy so nobody ever takes him seriously when he tells of these weapons and cures. The funny thing about that final one is that he's actually extremely intelligent, and occasionally I see in the news that a new cure for cancer is being tested and I'll recognize it as one of the ones he proposed to me like a decade ago, though I've yet to hear anything about his fusionless thorum bomb that's more powerful than any nuclear weapon ever created.

It's getting ridiculous. If I can just stop him drinking alcohol all this can stop. At the rate he's going he'll end up sectioned again or having another heart attack due to the stress this causes him.",3,1730359816.0,schizophrenia,2,1.0,False
1gg8xzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gg8xzl/i_think_my_23m_marriage_with_35f_husband_becomes/,"I think my, 23M, marriage with 35F husband becomes toxic. I need some advice from you?","I, 23M, got married to my husband 35M last year. As in the all relationship, everything was ideal from the beginning, I was feeling appreciated, respected, loved, I was feeling I was special for him. But at some point everything started fading. Here is a little background:  
We are from different countries and same sex marriage is prohibited in both of our countries and we got married in the US, last year. He is from the very big, monster country, that has occupied some part of my country's land. For people in the US, it may not be important, but believe me, it is relevant. After the marriage, we both went to his country to see some places and get to know his part of the family and friends. After a moth, I left for my country and he stayed there. We were both unemployed at that time, because the job I had, fired me because if was prohibited to work from there. In December, I was attending my courses at the university and he offered me a ticket to Moscow and to stay there for some time and was planning to find job there for both of us before we would find something better. I left my university, and in 5 hours, I managed everything to be done for moving there. I even took care of the cat in that 5 hours.  
December was little strange, both of us were unemployed. He barely would complement me, kiss or hug me. I love physical connection and I was the one who was initiating sex all the time. When I realised that something was off, I confronted him and asked what was wrong. He said he was tired and anxious. Two weeks later I found out that he was flirting with other guys on one of the dating apps. I also found out that he met someone for a coffee when he left to greet me at the airport in Moscow. We had agreed that our marriage would be closed, but we wouldn't limit each other, I was too shy to ask him to remove the application (it was not grindr), I just  logged off my account and I kept the app in phone as well as he did. He didn't have energy to hug me, but he had energy to flirt with other guys. I was feeling horrible when I found it in his tab. I wanted to buy a ticket and go back to my country, but I let him explain himself. Before I went to Moscow, I missed him and decided to open the app and see our old messages, I went through all the way above and screenshot some of the messages and send it to him to remind him that I was missing him. On the same day, he wrote me that he felt bad why I was on that app, I said I wanted to look through our first messages and I was not going to do anything bad that could harm the relationship.  
As he said, he couldn't sleep for three days because he felt bad for it but I didn't know about it. His words were like ""I decided not to struggle and just accepted that it was ok for us to be there"" even though I never said this. After an hour of discussion he managed to convince me not to leave, however I left 2 weeks later after the incident.  
I was down, I was blaming myself not to be better, I wanted to be good enough for him not to think of others. Then in February, he visited my country and I found out that he was chatting with guys again, one more devastating moment. We argued and that was all. In March, I visited him and found out that he created a fake account in that app and was chatting with guys again. One more time, I felt betrayed. I June, he visited my country for his birthday and I found out that he had created an account, not just fake, but with his pictures. I felt horribly offended. He even said that he needed it. I only had one question: Why couldn't he respect my wish and couldn't resist without it when he was not using it in the beginning of our relationship? He doesn't usually tell me good and pleasing words ever since. Gives me a silent treatment. I started a therapy and found out that I have something called anxious attachment. I have not done anything but to telling him what truly bothered me. Now I am damaged, my mind is damaged and I am hurt. I don't want to end the relationship and also I don't want to get used to it, because it means that I lost all the feelings I had, but how long I can continue like this, I don't know. Can you please advise me what to do? ",1,1730359773.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1gg8vs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Machines/comments/1gg8vs9/ninja_dual_brew_troubleshooting/,Ninja Dual Brew Troubleshooting,"Here are some of the most common issues and their solutions:

* **Coffee is too weak or too strong:** If the coffee is too weak, try using the **Rich Brew** setting or adding more coffee grounds to the filter. If the coffee is too strong, try using the **Classic Brew** setting or using fewer coffee grounds.
* **Brew cycle is too slow:** The brew time will vary depending on the size and brew style. Larger carafe sizes and **Rich Brews** will take longer than single-serve and **Classic Brews**.
* **Cup or travel mug overflowed**: The sources provide a chart of the approximate brew volume for each size and brew style.
* **Brew basket overflowed:** The brew basket may be clogged, especially if using finely ground coffee or too much coffee. The sources recommend using medium-grind coffee. Additionally, using both a permanent filter and a paper filter can lead to clogging, so only use one or the other. Decaf coffee absorbs water differently, so use fewer scoops to prevent overflow.
* **Water remaining in the reservoir:** It is normal for some water to remain in the reservoir after brewing. This is to keep the brewer from running dry.
* **Leaking:**
   * A small amount of water in the reservoir valve after removing the water reservoir can be wiped away with a dry cloth.
   * If the leak is coming from above the brew basket, the brew basket may be overflowing.
   * If the leak is coming from below the brew basket, close the drip stop.
   * If the leak is coming from the bottom of the brewer, contact customer service.
* **Intelligent Clean Cycle Indicator is illuminated orange:** This indicates that the brewer needs to be descaled. If a clean cycle has been completed recently, another cycle may be necessary to remove additional mineral buildup.
* **Brewer isn't detecting the Ninja Pod Adapter:** Make sure that the adapter is properly seated with the handle in the **LOCK** position. The **Hot Water Dial** should also be turned completely to the coffee bean icon.
* **Coffee splattering:** While some splatter is normal, using the cup tray will help to reduce splatter. Make sure the Ninja Pod adapter is installed over the brew basket when brewing pods.
* **Brewer isn't displaying sizes or styles to brew:** Ensure that the sliding lid is fully closed and the **Hot Water Dial** is turned to either the coffee bean or water droplet icon.
* **Water reservoir is unstable:** Make sure the **Configurable Water Reservoir Latch** is properly installed and that the reservoir is properly seated on the base.",1,1730359476.0,Coffee_Machines,0,1.0,False

 I immediately turned it off, turned it upside down, and whiped it off well. Then I cleaned the keyboard with a tiny bit of alcohol and let it sit in rice for maybe 30 minutes. Now I have it sitting upside down to dry.

It was probably around 1 to 2 tablespoons of Mt. Dew. I want to get back to gaming but I can't afford a new computer, and this is the only thing I have to do for fun. It's basically my entire life, as sad as that is.

I was planning on waiting 24 or more hours, opening it up, and cleaning it out, is that overkill?

The culture created by regular customers at my store is AWFUL. When I transferred to my location a year ago it was very clear standards weren't being followed. Splitting fraps with all the goodies, beverage components on the side, giving out espresso drinks made as lattes, not charging for no water refreshers, espresso in trentas. When i would coach partners on this i would catch a ton of flack from other ssvs so i said welp if they don't care i don't either 🤷‍♀️ then it turned to other ssvs handing out free merch, taking food from their usual morning regulars and putting them in fraps. Warming food we can't warm up in the ovens. Refills on multiple drinks when the customer hasn't been in store. All of these issues are brought to management and nothing is being done about it, & if you coach to following standard you're the bad guy. 

Yesterday another regular came in demanding a winter launch drink and started berating the barista at the front, when the barista said they'll be able to get it in a week. Customer started shouting, name dropping the person giving it to them. The SSV who is doing this has been giving out new holiday drinks to multiple customers. Today a couple came in specifically came in and named dropped them saying they were excited for their ""sneak peak."" Obviously they left when I said that SSV wasn't in store and i wasn't allowed to give it out yet. 

When the ssv was coached on it, the push back given was ""We are in the people business serving coffee, not the other way around. There's been a lot of ""policing"" customers lately that I think we need to discuss at our next meeting.""

SO. 

That being said, when this is brought up during the meeting i know it'll be a blood bath. To me, it's confusing. I understand making the moment right with some customers. With things like them forgetting they wanted foam ontop or they needed an extra shot. It seems like the line has become strayed farrrrr from, when is it crossing the line of ""policing"" and following basic Starbucks corporate standard? 

All of these behaviors have created such a toxic culture from the customers. We are ""the other Starbucks"" & unfortunately this has lead to mistreatment of the baristas more times than i can count in my experience at this store. 

These ssvs basically run this store on their own terms however they want whenever they want & i know the specific SSV that was coached on what i know to be a fireable offense on multiple occasions will 100% be defensive and argumentative with no repercussions during this meeting and it's kind of like 🤷‍♀️ im at a loss lol ",1,1730359113.0,starbucks,4,0.67,False

We’ve been revising the rules and conditions and have come up with a challenge that we feel is pretty “challenger friendly”, but closes any loopholes we could think of. Here are the ground rules:

**The Room**

The original challenge was “how long could you stay in the freezer?” But we’ve decided to change it to a climate controlled room that is kept at 10°F, since our freezer has AC units that are loud and obnoxious. 

The Room will be the same size as our freezer at work, so roughly 25ft x 25ft.

The only thing in the room is a queen sized bed and a weather proofed TV. (We added “weather proofed” because we’re all 99% certain a normal TV would eventually stop working if kept in a room that cold.) Additionally, the TV comes with any subscription/streaming services picked by the challenger, so you can load it up with anything you want free of charge. 

**The Keeper**

You’ll be constantly monitored by The Keeper. The Keeper looks like your stereotypical spy/secret agent. Tall, male, short hair, dark glasses, wears a suit, doesn’t make small talk. He won’t be in the room with you, but he’ll be monitoring your vitals. If at anytime during the challenge you show signs of physical or emotional distress that could impact your physical or mental health, he will end the challenge and you’ll be payed for however long you stayed in The Room.

**Meal and bathroom breaks**

The challenger gets 3 UNPAID meal breaks. Meals will be eaten on a table a few feet outside of The Room. You’ll get one hour for breakfast (I’ll get to why it’s an hour long later, and The Keeper will wake you up if needed) from 8am until 9am, a half hour for lunch from 1pm to 1:30pm, and dinner will time will be chosen by the challenger, but you MUST eat dinner. Meals are prepared by The Keeper, and he can make whatever you want, so if you want a grilled cheese sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie “just how your mom makes them”, he can do it.

Additionally, twice per day and in between meals, you can request one pint of a hot liquid. The liquid can be coffee, tea, hot cocoa, broth, etc. Everything in the pint mug/glass must be a liquid and must have a density/viscosity similar to water, so you can’t request something like chowder or chicken noodle soup. You’ll press a button and tell The Keeper what you want and he’ll prepare it for you.

You can use the bathroom whenever you want. To minimize time spent in the bathroom, we’ll say it’s right next to The Room. However, you’ll only be able to use the restroom if you have to, and you must go back into The Room once you finish, so you can’t just sit on the toilet for 2 hours to warm up. Bathroom breaks are also UNPAID and time spent in the bathroom is rounded UP to the nearest quarter hour, meaning every time you use the bathroom, you’ll miss out on at least $250

**Clothing, hygiene, and equipment**

You can bring anything that you already own into The Room with you, as long as it is not an electronic device and as long as its purpose is not to create heat (so no phones, gaming consoles, or heaters, etc.). But you can bring however many blankets or quilts that you want. 

You can’t bring clothes into The Room with you. You’ll remain in your same outfit for the entire duration of the challenge, but you can wear as many layers as you want. So can wear whatever you want, thermal undergarments, parkas, hoodies, ski masks, ski goggles, ear muffs, gloves, scarfs, etc.

At breakfast time, The Keeper will bring you a “change of clothes” that is an exact match of the outfit you began the challenge with. He’ll wash your old clothes and make any needed repairs to them so that they’re ready for you to put back on the next day. You’ll also shower after breakfast. (This is why breakfast is an hour long). 

Before the challenge starts, you’re allowed to cash in up to 5 hours worth of pay to stock up on clothes and equipment. So, if you wanted to by a cold weather sleeping bag and one of those little tents that the people that climb Mount Everest use, you could cash in a few hours worth of pay beforehand and do that. You can use the money on clothes to keep you warm if you feel you don’t have enough. You could even use it to stock up on things to keep you entertained like books and puzzles. However, you will not be paid for the time you cashed in on. So if you cash out 4 hours to give yourself $4000 to spend, you won’t start making money until hour 5.

**Additional Rules**

Any time saved by eating meals quicker will be added to your total once the challenge ends. For example, if you save 5 minutes on each meal break (15 minutes per day) and stay in The Room for a week, you’ll have an hour and 45 minutes added to your total. 

There is no food or water allowed in The Room. You’ll only eat and drink during your meal breaks, and we’ll say there’s a water fountain by the bathroom that you can drink from as you go to and from The Room.

You have no contact with anyone. Your only human interaction will be with The Keeper.

Time spent in The Room will be rounded UP to the next quarter hour when the challenge ends. For example, if after taking your total time spent in The Room, deducting your time spent in the bathroom, and adding your time saved during meals, your total is 1000 hours an 16 minutes (1000.26 hours), you’ll be payed for 1000.5 hours.



Well, that’s the challenge. My boss at work was pretty confident and said he could tough it out for a couple months, a few guys said they’d just hang out for a day or two until they got bored.

Tenho um clássico setup que inclui um eureka mignon e uma delonghi dedica. 

Sinto que o café poderia ir mais além, quando comparo com casas de especialidade, como a fábrica coffee roasters, porque mesmo usando o mesmo café que eles não consigo obter a mesma profundidade de sabor. 

Já moo o café o suficiente para não engasgar a máquina e para garantir que o café sai em cerca de 25-30seg e mesmo assim não chega lá. Uma das diferenças que sinto é que o café sai muito quente quando comparado com casas de especialidade, mas já meti na definição mais baixa de temperatura da máquina.

Será do setup ou há algo q possa fazer?

Sendo do setup, o que seria um bom passo em termos de máquina ou moinho?

Or just say nothing?,"My (26F) boyfriend (28M) is starting his training next year as an ED doctor. He recently got his roster, and I recognized the name of one of his future colleagues—someone I went on a casual coffee date with over two years ago, a few weeks before I met my boyfriend. There was no chemistry, and we just didn’t message each other afterward.

My boyfriend has mentioned that he hopes to become friends with his colleagues, which is pretty typical for him. I only remember the guy’s last name because I looked him up back then to vet pre date (just to make sure he was real etc) and just happen to have a good memory for people I’ve met. I’m pretty sure the guy won’t remember me (at least, I hope not!).

So I’m a bit torn: should I mention it to my boyfriend now just to get it out in the open, or leave it and only address it if it ever comes up? I’m not worried about my boyfriend’s reaction—I’m more concerned with making things less awkward in the long run. Also, do you think it’s likely this guy will even remember a brief coffee date from years ago?

Can not stand the current one. First I liked being able to extract when I wanted in MWZ. Ive had to abandon to many games because I just don't have hours to spend on each game.

Second, last night I went down on level 31 because I did something stupid. I wasn't able to be revived. Now I don't want to spawn in again with basic weapons, but I had enough time to make coffee, feed the cat, go reset a circuit breaker in the laundry, drink my coffee and still sit and watch my team try finish the round. Literally 10 minutes of other people playing. I have time-stamp pictures to prove it. This is after I'd tried to trigger the extract and everyone voted no. 

What a complete waste of my time. 

I don't know how to parse out the times on Steam as it's all now under ""COD"" but I've got 2000hrs in COD, MW2, Cold War and MW3 (I don't know if it's counting my MW2019 as that was PS).

Was shopping at the local grocery store and decided to try these beans out (**Cafe Direct Machu Picchu Organic Whole Beans**). Never heard of this brand before so wanted to give it a shot.

I'm using a Breville Barista Express with the following settings:

\- Grind amount: default

\- Grind size: very fine (3)

\- Beans: 18g

The double shot was very watery, did not pull well at all. Pre-infusion was 5 seconds and the entire pull lasted less than 10 seconds. The needle did not reach espresso range.

Any idea what the issue here might be? The beans are ground really fine so not sure what else I could adjust to yield a normal doppio.

Thanks.

quick to ignite,
flickering in the shadows of midnight.
It doesn’t care who you are,
what you’ve been through,
how you laugh,
or the way you chew your words when you’re nervous.
Lust is a hunger,
an ache that just wants to be fed,
the body calls and anyone can answer.
It’s skin on skin,
heat on heat,
a flash of lightning that doesn’t wait for the storm.
Lust says, ""I want,""
but never “I want you.”

Lust, it’s primal,
it’s a need with no name,
no face, no history, no future.
It’s faceless in the night,
picking strangers out of the dark,
any body will do.
It’s a thirst that demands quenching
but doesn’t care if it’s water or wine.
It’s that craving that says,
I just need this,
but you?
You’re a placeholder in a moment,
a fix in the haze of a night that’ll be forgotten by morning.
Lust is a blunt instrument.

Desire?
Desire calls me by name.
Desire moves through me like a quiet storm,
slow and steady, not asking for quick release

Desire doesn’t just want,

You.
Specifically.
It’s the way your smile lingers at the edge of a sentence,
the way your eyes hold a question that only I’m meant to answer.
It’s the sound of your voice in my head when I close my eyes,
the way you move through space,
the rhythm of your breath when you’re lost in thought.

Desire isn’t about filling a void,
it’s about reaching for something more,
reaching for you,
because no one else will do.
It’s your hands, not just hands.
Your lips, not just lips.
It’s wanting to know you,
to understand your mind,
to trace the lines of your story,
to dive deep into the ocean of you
and never come up for air.

Lust passes through,
it consumes,
but leaves you hollow.
Desire stays.
Desire lingers in the quiet of the morning,
wraps itself around you like soft sheets,
stays for coffee and conversation,
wants to know what you’re thinking when you stare off into the distance.

It's been years and I forgot most stuff. So I'm starting from the basics again. Just starting small by using HelloChinese and creating Anki Flashcards for every character I study. I plan on going more in depth once I finish the tree on the app.

Besides that, I wanted some daily exposure to Mandarin, so I decided I'd listen to some podcasts while I'm driving to work and back. I heard great reviews for Coffee Break Chinese so I started listening to it.

Things were fine in the beginning but I started to get annoyed when the instructor would tell the guy how to pronounce it and he would pronounce it a bit differently. No big deal, he's still learning.

But today during the episode there was a lot of mispronounciation, for example when he was learning about 这是 he would pronounce 这 like ""zhu"" instead of ""zhe"". And the instructor would say good job. But when the instructor would say it, she'd say it correctly and then this guy says it wrong and she doesn't correct him just says good job.

I'm finding it frustrating and confusing because I'm hearing two different pronunciations from both of them. I know the instructors is right, but when he says it, it throws me off. 

It makes sense that he's learning with us as we go, but her not correcting him confuses me. There are a lot more examples with his pronunciation being different from hers and her just saying good job.

1gg8676,https://i.redd.it/vfqxd2e2d1yd1.jpeg,25 with 25+ fillings so scared ,"Long story short I had braces for a long time as a kid and parents never really talked about oral health. I got scammed by my dentist post 6 years of having braces and they said I had 13 cavities. Got those filled and have had at least 10 more filled since then I lost track bc I got used to fillings. I could have less than 25 but I’m assuming it’s about that many bc I can’t remember. My teeth are in relatively good shape from what my current dentist has said but she says I should really be careful to not further weaken my enamel. I’m so incredibly frightened about the possibility of losing my teeth or having dentures before 30 or 40. I have a filling on almost every tooth. I’ve been brushing, flossing, mouthwash, and my 6 month checkups. I’ve decreased coffee to 2 cups in the morning and water after. Then brush. Please advice am I doomed to lose my teeth? This truly keeps me up at night. I try so hard and I’m so scared nothing I do will help. My teeth seem to be rather healthy no receding gums or decay just lots of filling and discoloration from years of too much coffee in college which is why I cut back.

1gg85m5,https://i.redd.it/kgy7gs2uc1yd1.jpeg,What is the process for creating a custom animated logo and brand intro? ,"🎬 ""From Sketch to Swag: How Your Logo Gets Its Groove On!""


---

1. The Big Idea – “The Logo-Birth Brainstorm!” 💡
Alright, so first things first: before a logo can strut its animated stuff, it needs to be born, and for that, we need ideas. Picture a brainstorming session with coffee cups everywhere, random doodles of half-baked designs, and phrases like “It’s gotta POP!” flying around. This is where the magic starts, and we’re talking all the juicy details: what’s the vibe? Serious? Fun? Elegant? You’re basically giving your logo a personality test. Because let’s face it, nobody wants a boring logo!


---

2. Sketch, Doodle, Refine – “Where the Pencil Meets the Pad” ✏️
Now, here’s where your logo gets its first face! Think of it like the “awkward middle school” phase – sketches, rough drafts, and maybe a few laughs over how bizarre some early versions look. But with each sketch, your logo gets closer to its true self. And hey, this part is essential – we’re talking about all the fine details, tweaking every curve, color, and font. We’re sculpting the masterpiece, one sketch at a time.


---

3. Bringing It to Life – “Lights, Camera… VECTOR!” 🎨
Once we’ve got the final design locked in, it’s time to make it look smooth and sharp, baby! We bring out the big guns – vector design. This is where your logo gets primed for animation: every line, every angle polished like it’s heading to the red carpet. It’s like turning a sketch into a superstar. Clean lines? Check. Perfect proportions? Check. Now we’re cooking with pixels!


---

4. Movement Magic – “Animation: Where Your Logo Learns to Dance!” 🕺
Alright, brace yourself because this is where things get real. We’ve got the design; now it’s time to bring in motion design tools like After Effects or Blender. We’re talking smooth transitions, zoom-ins, fades, rotations, you name it. Suddenly, your logo isn’t just a picture – it’s got personality, pizzazz, and maybe even a little attitude. Think of this step like teaching your logo its dance moves. And believe me, when your brand's logo spins or glows on screen, it’s got all the swagger.


---

5. Sound Check – “Because Every Great Entrance Needs a Killer Track!” 🎶
A silent logo is like a silent movie – impressive, sure, but it could be better with sound! So we add in sound effects or a catchy audio intro. A few “whooshes” and “pings” later, your logo isn’t just seen – it’s heard. Whether it’s dramatic or playful, sound elevates the logo to an experience. It’s that last ingredient, the cherry on top. And just like that, your logo is ready to make an unforgettable entrance!


---

6. The Final Touch – “Feedback, Tweaks, and a Little Logo TLC” 🔍
Every logo deserves a good polish before its debut. We get feedback, adjust a few frames, maybe add a little extra sparkle here, a zoom there. It’s like the final dress rehearsal. You want to see your logo in its best light, perfect from every angle. We want people to watch it and go, “Wow, that’s our brand?!” And when we get that “yes,” we know it’s ready for the spotlight!


---

7. Showtime – “Making Its Debut on the Red Carpet of Digital Branding!” 🚀
And… action! Your logo is ready to hit screens, introducing your brand to the world with style. Whether it’s gracing your website, shining in your social media intros, or even stealing the spotlight in a presentation, this animated logo is now a brand ambassador. It’s got character, charisma, and it’s ready to rock.

So there you have it – the journey from doodle to digital rockstar. Because when your logo’s got moves, so does your brand!

1gg85jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_baggedstories/comments/1gg85jc/the_worst_tinder_hook_up_ive_had/,The worst tinder hook up I’ve had.,"It was in the summer of 2020 Covid already ravaging everyone in the whole community around us. No work, school not in session and just freshly broken up with my girlfriend, (we had incompatibility issues) I hopped on the good old tinder to see what was going on. Prior to Covid I worked probably about 40 hours plus going to community college 3 days a week. I was always out late at night working events and venues. I used to drink but I don’t drink anymore and one night I was swiping getting a few matches and getting pretty risky with some of them.

I was about 22-23 at the time, my mind still young and dumb, willing to go after anything that I found somewhat attractive. I never dated in high school, so college was a great coming of age time for me. My experiences hooking up with my ex and pushed me off of ever wanting to meet up with her again. The constant quarantine sex and then absolute zero afterwards really messing me up into thinking I needed a physical connection to just get over her. I think I was just really horny. At least that’s what I tell myself now when I look back at it, maybe I’m just a deviant with low self-respect. 

Among us was still big back then. I message this girl on Tinder after we matched asking what she was doing. I was swiping through her pictures. Some were filters, a lot of the pictures dark, her face slightly chubby but a cute smile. Something that didn’t bother me at all,the chubbiness. At least I remember the conversation moved off Tinder on Snapchat. We’re sending a couple risqué photos back-and-forth almost feeling a sense of confidence boost. I was in a good place fitness wise. I lost a few pounds and gained a few pounds of muscle, working out at home, running, exercising and sweating outdoors anything just to get my mind off of being locked up in the house doing nothing.

I moved back to my dad’s house after failing out of college a few years prior, the next few years I was in community college simply just trying to do well in school. My schedule was school, come home and work at nights. My days are pretty filled up my weekends filled with work and simply just drinking on the days where I didn’t have to be up early at all. A terrible combination I know. Never meeting new people, just work school and home. Much different than my wild college days. 

I remember I was really drunk off of some whiskey my dad and I played backyard bocce earlier that day just going back-and-forth, playing and playing getting drunker and drunker the night. I decided was horny and I wanted to have sex I didn’t care of being vulgar with my messages. Im not saying I was a good person, but all my friends got way more being direct and sexual instead of going on dates. I think it’s an expectations thing, people feel your motives, and at least appreciate someone being honest about them. 

I was as I started blasting off messages to girls had match with I’m not the most attractive person by any means, but on Tinder sometimes it pays to be superficial and I try to use that to my advantage swiping on girls. I didn’t find the most attractive but seem like they’d be a good time or at least had a good personality. I gave everyone a shot that night and she was the one most eager to talk and be serious about meeting.

I sent her a shirtless pic after I’m done working out about to get in the shower. The sky hazy and orange with smoke wildfire, filling the state covering every single area even if I wanted to go out the air quality was terrible and I was stuck inside for most of the week. I ask her what she’s doing that night. She’s playing among us with her friends stuck at home, her mom and dad and family at the house I find out she was a couple miles away from me. She’s only 19, but has graduated and been out of school for a couple years, making me feel a bit more comfortable with the few year age gap. 

Honestly she was just probably a five minute drive if I just got my car and left that night to see her, I was drunk and willing to even drive then it’s only a few blocks. Can’t be that bad I think to myself, she puts it off and says no not tonight I can’t sneak out. Thank god for my dick not making me drink and drive. 

She was telling me “My parents will hear me sneaking out at night.” I get it don’t meet up with random strangers at night and get in the car no one knows about. My parents didn’t care what I did. I just live with my dad and he passed out by 8 PM every night and didn’t care where I was. I can just run around the town doing whatever I felt like doing that day. 

The text and the images and chats burned into my brain. iMessage her “OK so for not hanging out tonight what do you want to do?” She says “I’ll meet up with you tomorrow after work if that works for you. Maybe we can get Dairy Queen?”

 I’m desperate I understand the feeling guys go through when they say they’re desperate for pussy and I’ll do anything for it. I understand being down bad. Making decisions you don’t wanna do when you think about it from a different perspective. Things you don’t wanna fucking live with anymore that make you cringe in remembrance. “Where do you work” trying to build a little bit more rapport with her “i work at Taco Bell.” She gives me the address it’s the one I go to all the time I don’t recognize her she’s probably in the back making the tacos or the food or at the register in the front. It’s Covid so she’s probably a cook or somewhere back there, maybe I’ve seen her and she’s been working the counter and the drive-through and I just didn’t recognize. It would be even worse for me if that was the case. She asked if I could pick her up from work.

I agreed and she asked what we wanted to do afterwards I simply texted her back DTF? And left it at that. We both knew it wasn’t gonna be anything serious. We’re both on Tinder, but just looking for a hook up at the end of the day, without making it too vulgar There’s a little bit of fun in the chase, the texting the pictures, excitement leading up to it. That morning were texting. She said she’s about to get ready to go early in the afternoon to her shift and asked if we can get Dairy Queen after work when I pick her up, I agree not really thinking about it. It seems like a good idea we can kind of get to know each other before we do the deed or at least hopefully I thought in my mind. She has a couple more personal questions as we were texting with the occasional picture sent in between, she asked if I was OK with her being a “fat girl” and I said yes I don’t mind. Give me a little bit of a torta it’s not a big deal to me. I like something to grab onto and honestly I kinda like the body like that. Remember I’m horny and we’ve been leading up to this over a day or two. 

She sends me a photo her out of the shower. Her legs lifted up little bit bigger than I saw her pictures on Tinder but again I’m not surprised. I’m not going into this thinking of the world of every single person on there. Everyone wants to make themselves look better. It’s hard to find a real person on there especially when they’re on there at that time in their lives. I Hang around the house waiting for her to get off. I don’t drink anything that night or afternoon which I probably should’ve even just a shot to calm my nerves, but I was horny and excited I didn’t need anything else. 

It was probably at least 100° that day, it was hot the fires were raging. I was sweating and anticipation and nervousness probably had a couple cups of coffee that morning one too many how much I was sweating. It was exciting the first girl I’ve been with or met up with after breaking up with my ex. This Taco Bell girl wasn’t her and was a breath of fresh air after the nightmare my ex was. 

I really spent the last couple months working on myself getting fit losing a few pounds and honestly just trying my best to be a stronger and more confident version of myself to me. She’s gonna get off at eight I head over around 7:50 Taco Bell not that far from my house I’m laughing at myself as I think about what I’m doing picking up a girl from Taco Bell. You’re going on a date with her and trying to hook up or at least she’s meeting her and feeling her out for the first time seeing for a good match. It’s still Covid so I still a little worried about everything I wasn’t the biggest person worried about the sickness but back then no one knew anything about it. It just was people getting sick all of a sudden young people started getting it and we thought it was only old people wearing masks absolutely everywhere. It was insane. 

I get up outside to Taco Bell texting her I’m here and where I’m parked is he walk out the sun slowly setting it hasn’t been the solstice yet so it’s not super bright by the time she gets out I waited around a little bit after eight for her to get out of there, thinking she was almost gonna stand me up laughing at the situation I was in. I probably just would go get Taco Bell if that happened I thought to myself and just go eat it at home sad. Before I left, she texted asking if we were still going to Dairy Queen. I said yes kind of not sure why she was so fixated on it. Maybe she had a friend that worked there and she just wanted to check in with her to make sure she was safe and they knew who I was in case anything happened you can never be too safe on there. I texted my friend telling him what I was doing just in case something happened to me so you know.

Here’s the fun part fun to laugh at when I look back at the whole situation roll down my window. She walks up to the car. I’m probably about 150 pounds about 5’10” and I’m somewhat fit. My body is looking pretty good my abs slightly showing my skin tan from being in the sun the past few days just trying to work out and spent as much time outside as I can, despite the smoke, she gets in the car and I’m greeted by the smell of Taco Bell as well as spray on body spray that I could tell she put on in the bathroom or in the back room of Taco Bell before she came out. I look at her. Her face is cute she wasn’t that bad, I don’t like to put labels on people but I’ll try to describe her as best I can she’s probably about 5 foot two or three has a little bit of a stomach little bit legs her kinda big and her face is round and chubby again, I don’t mind. My girl was a little bit bigger than her had a bigger belly so to me I was doing better than I was six months ago dealing with that bullshit.

Like I said before the smell of Taco Bell, Doritos, Locos tacos and honestly, it was the lettuce that I could smell. I looked at her some crumbs and stains on her shirt from work again I’m horny I’m not here to judge. We make pleasant trees and some small talk. The nervous is filling the air. It’s always fun going to a hook up that’s not out of party. It’s kinda like a secret thing between you. Two only you two are experiencing it whether somewhere else or not, can recognize it from the outside doesn’t matter because it’s just you two in the car. It’s you two going out to get food Just two strangers meeting for the first time.

I drive across the street to the next parking lot where there’s a Taco Bell and some other stores. There’s a lot parking area there and a few spots in the back as well for trucks to pull up and honestly where I plan to park and hook up with her that night if she wanted to we couldn’t go to her house. We couldn’t rent a hotel and I didn’t want to bring back to mine my parents my dad was there as well. 

Her hand on my arm, her hands were soft and small compared to me. I felt as her fingers rubbed up and down my arm, my bodies response, giving goosebumps and just more pure excitement ready to finally hook up with a girl that I could tell was me. We go inside Dairy Queen and I’m trying to be nice here when I say I’ve never seen someone order the largest one there before. I think I got a ice cream swirl something to eat real quick. I didn’t want to get nothing and just pay for her only I thought that would’ve been weird. She gets the biggest blizzard I’ve ever seen with Reese’s chunks in it and bits of chocolate and some crunch thing I’m not exactly sure what it was but small price to pay I thought. Even though I also just picked her up from her job and was gonna drop her back off at her house later takeoff her masks as we go outside I watch her as she eats the blizzard in the car. We’re just shooting the shit laughing flirting slowly getting more touchy as time goes on, I didn’t drive a big car. It was an old Toyota fstick shift. It was hard for me to feel spacious in the car. I didn’t feel like she was having the most fun time in the passenger seat as well. Was she this blizzard? It was impressive how quickly she bit of food and ice cream I can see on the outside of her mouse and face. I just scooped up spoonful after spoonful, while I was talking to her and she replied to me after she was finished, eating the sun slightly gone down by now that’s why face is hard to see outside of your car and hard to see inside due to the angle of the sun. I pulled back around behind everything, I learn one thing I had to do with tinder is you either set the mood or you’re at the wind of whatever happens.

In the back of my mind there’s always a little bit of doubt should I do this? Is it wrong? Is it bad for me to hook up with someone when I don’t want a relationship with them? I wasn’t raised to be like this, but With the ease of access to tinder and women out there and my body just wanting something other than my hand I was ready to risk it all for just about any girl that comes into my life at that point. She closes her eyes and leans over to me after finishing her blizzard. And I think I can just go in fully committed to this. I tell myself you’re here to see you through you’re not gonna be a dick and say no drive her back home and kick her out. 

We start making out I feel the stick of the ice cream all over her lips as our tongue slide and play with each other, I still smell the Taco Bell on her that fast food smell that just permeates your clothes actually been working shifts and shifts and shifts no matter how many washes they can’t get that smell out of them we’re making out and it feels like the almost bit of food still in there. it’s probably the crumbles of whatever cookie or candy she got in her blizzard. Probably stuck in the cracks of her teeth behind her molars working their way loose as we tongue back-and-forth with each other. We get handsy around each other and she’s very receptive to it.

She grab my leg, one thing about her that was good was she knew what she wanted and she didn’t play around. Her hand and mine going up each others thighs. slowly going up feeling me as I get harder and harder. I think part of it is that she just wasn’t for me. We weren’t real match in a sense of true love, but we were a good match for a hook up both enthusiastic, both wanting each other and our bodies in tune, I start reaching lower and lower and start playing with her over her jeans. She’s receptive to it opening her legs the kissing stopped at the play with her, her hand holding me there almost making me continue. she slides her hands under my shirt and in the car we hang over the middle console. 

I ask her if she wants to go to the backseat, she agrees and doesn’t even try to climb over the center consul to get back there, but just gets out of the car slides the seat forward leaves it up and climbs in the back it’s dark by this time there’s no patrol dink little strip mall with stores with no real security driving around at night Gets hot and heavy in the backseat. I get in there and she tries to climb on top of me trying to fit her body over me. I don’t mind start grabbing your ass, making out again my face trying to pull away from her and go to her body, tired of the bits of food. I keep getting in my mouth every time she tries to shove her tongue down my throat. 

I slide my hands in her pants behind the tinted windows. I start playing with her pussy, it feels damp and wet Not sure if she’s wet from the session or from her shift at work and 100° sweltering heat. I don’t know if it’s air conditioning in the back of Taco Bell again I didn’t really care at this point she kisses my neck as I pull my hands away, rubbing my hair and over my nose to see what I’m working with right now. It didn’t smell bad but just like someone who just got off of work sweaty. The smell like body odor, but just down there, it didn’t gross me out too much but I just showered five minutes prior to leaving the house and I was ready to go. I’m not judging her she just got off of work.

She climbs down into the foot well. As I sort of sit up she slides my shorts down. I unhook my leg and pull my boxers down as well revealing my dick. She wasreally good at sucking it, but it just felt wrong. The stickiness around her lips as she rubbed it across her face, the bit of food or something hard in her mouth that I feel on the sides of me, she went up and down open her mouth all the way, my dick basically scraping and cleaning the sides of her cheeks and mouth. 
 
I’ve had enough, she finishes sucking as I tell her to get up and get on top I think this is the only way it’s gonna work in my mind. Either she stands there and I have to work towards her or she lays down and I have to be prone on top of her as I fuck her. honestly for sex we both had fun. She was a little wild a little bit loud probably happy to be having some fun during Covid without having to go home. I take her back to the house after we got dressed and got back up in the front seat. I dropped her off at her parents house, a sleepy, quiet neighborhood. As I park she gets out she waves to me as she walks in. we barely spoke after it. I think we texted, possibly for a day or two, but it scarred me too much the blizzard, the sticky lips and face and bits of food. I can see on her it was just Too difficult for me to come to terms with Dairy Queen forever being ruined. I will never order a blizzard. I will never look at people who order a giant blizzard, the same exact way ever again I don’t think I’ve ever gone since then. Four years later 4 1/2 at this point, Dairy Queen free and blizzard free. I guess I could say I’m thankful that she didn’t have chicken strips or some food to go along with it and it was just ice cream.

I went out to my car the next day almost feeling the smell of Taco Bell on her fingers as she rubbed them down my face, the smell of her perfume still lingering on my chair and the smell of shame and sex as I look in the backseat where we did everything. I grab the napkin. I put the condom in throwing it in the bag with another bag as I wrap it up to take it inside I throw it away in the trash, thankfully done with the blizzard girl.",1,1730356008.0,u_baggedstories,0,1.0,False

1gg81r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1gg81r2/finally_found_the_best_car_seat_covers/,Finally Found the Best Car Seat Covers,"So I recently took the plunge on a set of [Coverado Car Seat Covers](https://amzn.to/48y2ugT), and wow, I think I may have found the *best car seat covers* on the market. I've tried a lot of covers over the years (from cheap eBay sets to “fancy” leather-look ones), and I usually end up either peeling them off in frustration or just living with seats that look like my dog picked the fabric out. But with Coverado, it was honestly a whole new ball game.

**The Installation Struggle (but Worth It!)**  
Let me set the scene: it was a Sunday, about 90 degrees outside (so, of course, the perfect day to install car seat covers, right?).

I was prepared for the usual battle of stretching, tugging, and praying to the Car Seat Cover Gods, but Coverado was surprisingly easy to work with. I still managed to contort myself into a few yoga-like positions, but overall, the covers slipped on way smoother than others I’ve tried. Bonus: the instructions actually made sense, which is something I didn't realize I'd appreciate until I tried Coverado.

**I bought mine for really cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/48y2ugT)

**Real-Life Test (a.k.a. ""The Coffee Spill of '23"")**  
About two days after installation, the true test happened. My *coffee-loving-but-clumsy* self decided it would be a great idea to take a sharp turn with an open coffee cup (I know, rookie mistake). And yep, a decent amount of coffee went flying right onto the Coverado seat covers. I’ll admit, my first thought was something along the lines of, “Well, there goes that investment…” But surprisingly, the liquid just pooled up and wiped away like it was no big deal! No staining, no lingering coffee smell, nothing! Just a quick wipe-down, and they looked as good as new. 🤯

**The Comfort Level**  
These are actually *comfortable*, which is rare for seat covers that look this nice. I’ve had leather-ish covers in the past that felt like sitting on a slip-and-slide anytime it got warm out. But Coverado’s got this texture that feels sturdy but not sticky, soft but not flimsy. Even my dog seems to approve, and she’s usually the ultimate seat critic.

**The Look**  
They've definitely got a premium vibe without costing as much as some of those high-end brands. I went with a classic black to keep it looking sleek, but they’ve got other colors too. If I had to describe them, it’s like my car seats went from “well-used rental” to “maybe-I-could-Uber-in-this” quality.

**In Summary**  
If you’re on the fence about finding the *best car seat covers*, I’d seriously give [Coverado](https://amzn.to/48y2ugT) a shot. They're stylish, easy to install (with minimal wrestling), durable, and coffee-spill-proof, which is apparently my main concern these days. 😆 For real, it feels like my car got a little glow-up, and I’m not mad about it.",1,1730355534.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False
1gg819o,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1gg819o/my_totes_umbrella_review/,My Totes Umbrella Review,"Alright, folks, let’s talk about [Totes umbrellas](https://amzn.to/3Aayo6D). I’ve been through a fair share of “weather-proof” umbrellas that either flipped inside-out on me in a mild breeze or left me drenched as if I'd just taken a surprise dip in a lake. But Totes umbrellas? They actually live up to their name – durable, reliable, and, dare I say, stylish!

I bought my Totes umbrella a few months back after yet another flimsy umbrella bit the dust (RIP dollar-store special). Living in a rainy city means I need some serious umbrella power, so I went for one of the Totes Titan models, which I heard was pretty much hurricane-proof. And, I’m not kidding, on its first day out, it got put to the test.

Cue this freak thunderstorm. I’m talking winds that could carry away small dogs and rain that felt like a million tiny darts. Everyone else’s umbrellas were turning into sad, twisted metal sculptures, but there I was, standing strong under my Totes umbrella. At one point, a guy sprinting by literally yelled, “How is your umbrella still standing?!” I felt like some kind of umbrella superhero.

**I bought mine for really cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3Aayo6D)

The handle on these Totes umbrellas is no joke either – it’s super comfy to hold (even when you’re white-knuckling it), and it didn’t slip once. Also, bonus points for the automatic open/close feature. When you’re trying to juggle bags and a cup of coffee, having one-button control is the kind of luxury that feels priceless.

If I have one tiny complaint, it’s that this thing is so sturdy, it can feel a bit heavy if you’re carrying it around all day. But honestly, that’s just a trade-off I’ll take for not turning into a soggy mess in the middle of a storm.

So yeah, if you’re on the fence about [Totes umbrellas](https://amzn.to/3Aayo6D), I’d say go for it. Just be ready for random people to ask you where you got your “magic” umbrella during a storm!",1,1730355474.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False
1gg80n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1gg80n8/25_with_25_fillings_so_scared/,25 with 25+ fillings so scared ,"Long story short I had braces for a long time as a kid and parents never really talked about oral health. I got scammed by my dentist post 6 years of having braces and they said I had 13 cavities. Got those filled and have had at least 10 more filled since then I lost track bc I got used to fillings. I could have less than 25 but I’m assuming it’s about that many bc I can’t remember. My teeth are in relatively good shape from what my current dentist has said but she says I should really be careful to not further weaken my enamel. I’m so incredibly frightened about the possibility of losing my teeth or having dentures before 30 or 40. I have a filling on almost every tooth. I’ve been brushing, flossing, mouthwash, and my 6 month checkups. I’ve decreased coffee to 2 cups in the morning and water after. Then brush. Please advice am I doomed to lose my teeth? This truly keeps me up at night. I try so hard and I’m so scared nothing I do will help. My teeth seem to be rather healthy no receding gums or decay just lots of filling and discoloration from years of too much coffee in college which is why I cut back.

but i understand she’s going through something and i want to support her, especially as someone who’s dealt with mental illness so serious it lead to institutionalization. but do i have to forfeit the supposedly shared living room/dining room/kitchen for the rest of the time i live with this girl? i feel like i have a right to those spaces just as she does and its kinda unfair to spring this on me after we both signed up for and agreed to the initial living situation, which was sharing the bedroom and having the living area be communal space. 

anyways please be nice and give advice. im very non confrontational and i just wanna know if im right in feeling how i feel and i should talk to her, or if i should just swallow it and hope she starts sleeping in the bedroom again at some point",1,1730355339.0,badroommates,2,1.0,False
