1kjgimx,https://i.redd.it/ypktai7jwzze1.jpeg,I love wearing MTG shirts that pass for coffee memes but secretly help me meet more Magic players!,"I'm a coffee roaster in Las Vegas and a long time magic player. I sell/serve my coffee at a local farmer's market and love wearing shirts that have cross-over meaning for both coffee and magic.  My Izzet shirt here represents heat and water used to roast and brew coffee, but helps me make new commander friends. I have another shirt I got on etsy that's a cup of coffee on a magic card w a caffeine overload effect.  

My high school buddies aren't as open as me to wearing their magic pride shirts in public, but I love it and would love to make shirts that work as great magic cross-over. I don't make shirts or anything but I guess it's easy now with the help of ai.  

I'm happy to wear regular mtg shirts normally, but at the farmer's market it's cool when it serves the double purpose of working as a coffee shirt but ALSO as a secret filter for all the Magic players who happen to come to the market too.  I've met a lot of players that way.  Just today I met a guy who sells singles, maybe as a side business out of his garage.  

Do you ever wear or do creative stuff in public that you think only magic players would understand to meet other players?

1kjgh1y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjgh1y,The TinHiFi C2 2025 Mech Warrior- High Sex Energy,"Their words, not mine.

Howdy y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm taking a peek at the TinHiFi C2 2025 Mech Warrior today and according to the back of the box its gonna be a sexy time. We‚Äôve got ‚ÄúN52 High Sex Energy Neody Mium Boron‚Äù hiding out in these drivers and I'm not 100% sure what to think, but I'm down.

I was pleasantly surprised by this set. I didn‚Äôt expect all that much to be honest given this is marketed as a gaming IEM. And when you have a cheaper set with with a nice shell, usually all of that budget went into making that shell nice. In this case they actually gave us what I think is a nicer driver than in its big brother, the C3 MKII. Both claim to be high sex energy, but the little brother has a composite PU+LCP driver, whereas big brother has just LCP. And we all know silicone is sexy. Thanks to TinHiFi for sending a review set to share my thoughts. 

# Look and Feel

I wasn‚Äôt expecting much in the way of accessories when I opened up the box, and I also didn‚Äôt get much! This is a $39.99 set, and it was paired with slightly underwhelming accessories. It came with two sets of silicone eartips in small, medium and large that are exactly the same. They work just fine but I tip rolled with Tang Sancai Balanced tips, which are my favorite. Especially for a set like this where I‚Äôd like to bring the mids forward a bit.

The cable that came with it is thin and a bit tangle prone. I will say that it keeps surprisingly little memory and doesn‚Äôt weigh the set down on your ears. No microphonic interference. However, I needed an immediate cable upgrade for comfort and, well, style.

The shells deserve an upgrade. These are some of the nicest metal shells I‚Äôve ever seen on a sub $50 set of IEM‚Äôs. They fit comfortably, and look fantastic. Also, these things are BLACK. Like, Vantablack. They absorb all light, it‚Äôs pretty cool.  

# Sound impressions

The C2 2025 Mech Warrior looks like your quintessential gaming headset, and sounds a bit like it too. We have well accentuated bass and treble, giving us a big V shaped sound. Idk if you saw my flair, but my thoughts on which ‚ÄúV‚Äù is best are public.

Still, this set does the big V shaped sound correctly. Funny enough, the SeeAudio Neko came to mind when I first started listening to this set, almost the same tuning. Techs are another story, but let it suffice to say I liked the set off the bat. But do I like it enough to invite it in for coffee?

**Bass**

The base is very pleasant with neither too fast or too slow with a decay. Well resolved, in generous quantities. I don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed at any point by the bass nor do I feel that the subbass colors the other frequencies to an unpleasant extent. Subbase focus is tracks give you a nice immersive rumble. The midbass kick isn‚Äôt too distinctive, but never really leaves me wanting for more. There could be a bit more texture, but this is a $20 set. For its price, I like the bass a lot.

**Mids**

The vocals on the C2 2025 Mech Warrior can be a little recessed but still come through with enough clarity as to not feel like an afterthought. Normally on a single dynamic set this bassy, the sub base would bleed into the mid base and lower mid range, giving us a muddy presentation, but that‚Äôs not the case with the mech boy here. Vocals don‚Äôt sound hollow or nasally, just a tiny bit in the background.

The sets clarity really helps the mids to retain some character and bite. Stringed instrument retain a texture and noteweight that outperforms similarly priced big v sets. The Chu 2 and 7Hz Zero 2 come to mind.

**Treble.**

I‚Äôm a bit treble sensitive, and the set has treble that‚Äôs controlled enough for me to wear for a decently long session. That being said, after an hour or so it becomes to be a bit too much for me personally, and I need to switch sets or take a break. It‚Äôs an engaging and exciting sound signature, but I enjoy it in moderation rather than wear it all day.

The treble is well done for a budget single dynamic driver set. Pretty well controlled under my normal listening volume but does become a bit splashy when you crank the volume. Sibilance is a fairly consistent presence. It tends not to be too obnoxious, but that varies from track to track.

**Techs**

I thought the technical performance mostly punched above-weight. We had a fairly wide and dynamic sounds stage with enough depth to give you a good sense of space. I do believe these are marketed as gaming headphones so I can see why that would be beneficial. I myself don‚Äôt do too much gaming so I can‚Äôt help you there, sorry.

The clarity instrument separation and imaging were all impressive for sub $50 and I would say that this set should give in inspiration to other budget competitors. If the tuning were just a bit more neutral, this could easily be a daily driver for me. I can say that I flattened it out a bit using Qdelix 4K and I really enjoyed the performance afterwards. Great techs for the price.

# Final thoughts

I enjoyed the sensuous, sultry sound of the C2 2025 Mech Warrior. It has a nicly balanced big V presentation that‚Äôs going to satisfy many that crave that classic sound. Flatheads like me are gonna wanna try something like the Kefine Klean or a Tanchjim 4U if they want something in between. All in all it‚Äôs an excellent, balanced, technically impressive set. I wouldn‚Äôt kick it out of bed for a little sizzle. Thanks for reading!",1,1746900541.0,iems,1,1.0,False
1kjggng,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhiladelphiaEats/comments/1kjggng/your_guide_to_angelos/,Your Guide to Angelos,"I‚Äôve been asked numerous times for the best way to experience a cheesesteak from Angelo‚Äôs. We live down the street. Here‚Äôs your guide.

You‚Äôll get in line that likely goes around the block and it will take you maybe 15 / 20 minutes tops to get to order.

You get the cheesesteak with Cooper Sharp and fried onions.

Other options are the pizzas and they have some of the best hoagies in the city too.

You‚Äôll order and then you‚Äôll come back to pay when your order is ready with cash.  They‚Äôll text you.

You‚Äôll have about 45 minutes to an hour to kill.

Go to 12 steps at the corner of 9th and Christian if you want a down-home bar and a good beer.

Or walk a little further into the Italian market go pick up a can of beer or wine at DiBruno‚Äòs and sit outside.

You can also shop at the DiBruno Brothers and get some of the best cheese in the city.

Or across the street, you can go to Anthony‚Äôs coffee and get terrific gelato.

Or take a right on Christian and walk past the church to Isgros bakery for the best cookies

Lastly, if you want to get a really good cocktail, go to the best cocktail bar likely in the city, which is Grace and Proper on 8th and Carpenter.

Once you get your text, you‚Äôll walk back get into a separate line to pick up your order. You‚Äôll have to find a spot up and around the park to eat.

Please be respectful of the neighbors and don‚Äôt sit on people‚Äôs porches or litter.  If Angelo‚Äôs catches wind, they won‚Äôt let you back.

I (19M) never thought I‚Äôd be posting here, but something wild just happened, and I need to get this off my chest.

So, my biological mom bailed on me when I was one year old. My dad said she left because ‚Äúmotherhood wasn‚Äôt for her‚Äù and she wanted to ‚Äúlive her life.‚Äù Translation: she found some rich guy and peaced out. She never called, never visited, not even a birthday card. Basically erased me from her life.

I was raised by my dad and later my stepmom, who is amazing. They gave me a good life, supported me emotionally and financially, and helped me get into a decent college. I also started a small business online when I was 17, and it‚Äôs actually taken off. I‚Äôm doing pretty well for a 19-year-old, definitely more than she expected.

Fast-forward to two months ago: guess who randomly shows up in my DMs on Instagram?

Yup. Bio mom. After 18 YEARS of no contact.

At first she tried the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you so much, I thought about you every day‚Äù crap. I was skeptical but figured I‚Äôd give her a chance, at least to hear her out. We met for coffee and it was super awkward. She kept making comments like ‚ÄúWow, you must be doing really well,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you inherited my ambition.‚Äù

Fast forward to the second time we met ‚Äî she straight-up asked me to buy her a designer handbag. No joke. Said it would be a ‚Äúsymbol of reconnecting.‚Äù I laughed because I thought she was joking. She wasn‚Äôt.

I told her I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with that, and she went full meltdown. She told me I owed her because she ‚Äúsacrificed her youth to give birth to me.‚Äù I reminded her that she left before I could even form memories and didn‚Äôt raise me at all. She said, ‚ÄúBlood is blood‚Äù and I should be grateful she gave me life.

Since then she‚Äôs sent me guilt texts like ‚ÄúA real son would help his mother‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt be successful if I hadn‚Äôt had you.‚Äù I blocked her. Then she messaged my stepmom (who she‚Äôs never spoken to) on Facebook, calling her a ‚Äúparasite‚Äù who stole her family.

Now my dad‚Äôs lawyer is involved because she‚Äôs hinted at ‚Äúwhat she‚Äôs entitled to.‚Äù Apparently, she thinks I should financially support her because I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe result of her labor.‚Äù It‚Äôs actually disturbing.

Reddit, am I crazy for being this angry? Or is this level of entitlement just next-level?
I don‚Äôt know what to do
She is my mom and I want to have a good life with her but I don‚Äôt know

1kjg52f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kjg52f/should_you_trust_the_pureplus_wfs5300a_under_sink/,Should You Trust the PUREPLUS WFS5300A Under Sink Water Filter Review?,"The **PUREPLUS WFS5300A Under Sink Water Filter** has been a fixture in my kitchen for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs one of those products you never know you need until you have it. Diving into its daily use, I‚Äôve explored its NSF/ANSI certifications, filtration capacity, and even had a laugh or two during its installation process. Sharing my experience for those considering this filtration system!

**Installation Experience and Design**  
The product is surprisingly compact for its robust features, measuring 13.7 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches and weighing just under 4 pounds. The under-sink water filter boasts an updated quick-connect design intended to simplify the setup, and after fumbling with hoses for half an hour, I can confidently say anyone can do it. Connecting the system only to a cold water supply was straightforward, though be ready to double-check hose inserts to avoid leakage. Its sleek cartridge appearance blends cleanly under the sink without taking up excessive space ‚Äì a win for smaller kitchens like mine.

**How It Performs Daily**  
This under-sink filtration system shines with its high flow rate of up to 2.5 gallons per minute, which is noticeably faster compared to some alternatives I‚Äôve tried. Filling a pot for pasta night is no longer a test of patience! Certified by IAPMO to deliver 22,000 gallons of filtered water (approximately five years of usage), the longevity adds a tremendous value too. Having high water consumption in my household, I have yet to see it falter or reduce its pressure.

**Benefits**  
- A filtration accuracy of 0.5 microns effectively removes chlorine, heavy metals, and odors.  
- Quick-connect fittings simplify installation, reducing potential headaches.  
- Ultra-high 22,000-gallon lifespan means less frequent cartridge replacements and cost savings.  

**Grab the best deal on [PUREPLUS WFS5300A Under Sink Water Filter](https://aquagroove.com/p/b08zsnvf1w/).**  

**Water Quality and Taste**  
I was skeptical about whether the taste of filtered water would genuinely differ from standard tap water. This filtration system proved me wrong. Chlorine odors are essentially zeroed out, and impurities like sediments are captured effectively. Testing its claims, the WFS5300A even retains beneficial minerals without altering TDS values, ensuring healthy hydration for my family. My tea and coffee game has seriously leveled up.

**Downsides**  
- Installation requires secure hose connections to prevent leaks.  
- It‚Äôs adviseable to confirm faucet compatibility (1/2"" or 3/8"" NPT female threads); not all setups may work without additional parts.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Compared to the well-known Brita faucet filter, the PUREPLUS outclasses it with its larger capacity and faster flow rate. However, those looking for a system capable of removing TDS might lean towards a reverse osmosis system like the Waterdrop G3. The WFS5300A retains beneficial minerals, which is fantastic, but if you're particular about TDS removal, a specialized RO system will fit better.

**Value for Money**  
Considering the average daily cost of operation is $0.018 (yes, I calculated this during quarantine boredom), this water filter delivers affordable quality. You'd be hard-pressed to find a comparable under-sink option with equivalent filtration metrics and a lifespan of 22,000 gallons priced competitively on the market. From my perspective, the investment pays for itself within a year given my bottled water costs from before.

Don't force it. Learn to relax and do it, or don't do it at all. Don't believe anyone who tells you you can safely force a woman to squirt with giant dildos, crazy sex tricks, etc.","""**How to Make a Woman Squirt**

Got good and bad news for you:

One cannot necessarily make a woman squirt through orgasm. That‚Äôs the bad news.

Some women naturally squirt during orgasm due to their muscles briefly relaxing at that point, and then tightening up again. Some women might be able to learn to loosen their muscles up at orgasm to have a squirting orgasm safely, but this may not be possible for all women.

All women have something called the urethral sponge. It clenches during sex to prevent coital incontinence. Some women have it loosen up at orgasm for a moment, they gush, and then it tightens back up again. So, frequently, those women are going to squirt regardless of doing some crazy trick, or amazing sex. They may even gush from masturbation where they just rub their clits only.

Women that have a normal urethral sponge function, and cannot learn to relax it, will never squirt during orgasm regardless of what efforts are put in. In fact, if they try to force it by pushing, it will be a lot of straining and may not be healthy for them. They may also grunt and groan in unpleasant ways, or even have an accident while pushing too hard.

Now for the good news: despite all of this, almost all women can squirt!

This is because squirt is just extremely diluted bladder fluid. Almost all women‚Äôs bladders fill with this when they are aroused.

So long as a woman is well hydrated, empties her bladder right before sex, and then immediately becomes intensely aroused, her bladder should fill with basically just water. Orgasming helps this process along, too.

Now what? That urethral sponge has to relax. More arousal and orgasms aren‚Äôt going to help. This will just make it clench more. Don‚Äôt believe anyone that tells you otherwise. No amount of crazy tricks, or g spot rubbing, or giant dildos, or anything else are going to magically make a woman have a squirting orgasm without somehow forcing fluid past the urethral sponge, which, again, is unhealthy. The sponge is doing its job, and forcing fluid out of it is just bad. You risk weakening the pelvic floor, prolapse, incontinence, etc.

Generally only natural squirters, who have a naturally relaxed urethral sponge during orgasm, can squirt during orgasm, and those women who can learn to relax.

But all is not lost! The squirt is there, and it‚Äôs going to come out one way or the other. For some women they might just be able to relax for a second and then they can let it out. Others might need to really relax with a massage or something calming. Either way, that fluid is the exact same as the fluid that would come out during orgasm, as has been proven by a study \[3\], it‚Äôs just coming out a few minutes later.

The only way it would become urine and no longer be squirt would be if the woman waited a long time, especially if she is no longer aroused. Then her bladder will fill with straight up urine. So long as that doesn‚Äôt happen it will be squirt ready to gush out in all its glory.

Back to the analogy: imagine the coffee pot either makes a ‚Äúding‚Äù sound and lights up and immediately releases the water, or doesn‚Äôt have a notification, and just releases it a few minutes later instead. That‚Äôs the same water either way.

Just the same a woman can either make a lot of noise and have an orgasm while squirting, or wait a few minutes and squirt without these things happening simultaneously. Either way it‚Äôs the exact same fluid.

Now, is it as sexy for a woman to just relax and let it out separately from a wild orgasm? Some may not think so, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The woman could always play along for her partner and give her pussy a quick rub, and moan when she lets it out after relaxing. It seems like she‚Äôs coming, and her pussy is gushing squirt, so it‚Äôs hot. Plus, letting it out does almost certainly feel good for her, and it is still her squirt that was produced by arousal and orgasm, so it‚Äôs not fake per se.""

I met my fianc√© about 22 years ago in High School. We dated for a summer. We were each others first relationship and neither of us knew a thing about dating. Even though I was young I knew I instantly fell in love with her. She ended up leaving me because I was too intense. And I see that, I've always wore this intense look or vibe. Even all these years, I still do.

I moved to another state. We tried to get the long distance relationship to work. I had plans of joining the Army and she didn't like it but would never tell me to not do it. She'd always tell me to do what I needed to. She would never want to feel like she was the reason someone didn't get to do what they wanted in life. Things ended again because I was on the fence of joining. So I joined after it ended. We spoke again while on my first tour overseas and we were engaged. But so many things happened. All the bs that comes with war attached itself onto me. I lived with death everyday, and lost many close friends. She ended up pulling away again due to either being scared of losing me or the fact that I wasn't there with her and she probably needed someone then and there.

So things ended again, I was messed up and I had so much trouble containing it all and trying to be normal from it. I jumped the gun, found some random woman from my hometown on Myspace of all things. I didn't know what I wanted or needed but I ended up marrying this new woman when I got back from my first tour. It all happened so fast. I think I was just so hurt that I felt I needed love like that. But it didn't help for how many problems I had in my head. But even then, I know I wasn't even bad. I treated her very well. My biggest problem was sleeping pills weren't working and I resorted to drinking wine every single day to cope. I left for a second tour and found out this woman I married spent all my money from my last tour and cheated on me. And it messed me up even more. I mentioned before, I was a very kind soul to her. The military provided therapy for those of us who deployed and I took advantage of it after the first and second tour. I know my flaws and triggers. But I was never a bad man to her, I just cried a lot and woke from some of the most terrifying nightmares. We hardly spoke after I returned from my second tour. Once I left the military I dropped her off at  her moms home and told her we were divorcing. It was a shock to her but I knew I would never be able to trust her. So my first marriage ended in cheating.

I get back home, I spend a few years sorting myself out. I still drank wine heavily. I suffered from chronic migraines, I still had nightmares those years. I should mention, I left the military in 2010 and I think my actual last horrific nightmare was in 2014. That's just nightmares, I still to this day have constant flashbacks and memories I live through on average 50 times a day. I worked for a retail store at that time. I felt my body and mind needed adrenaline to keep those memories at bay. I needed to do anything to not feel like I did. I just wanted to be normal again and live a boring life. I didn't know how to handle myself. 

I ended up talking with my now fianc√© again at that time. She was pregnant with her first and only child with a man that never loved her or the child he helped create. She says we hung out a lot at that time and I don't remember much of it. I was in a very bad place mentally and emotionally. But I know I absolutely loved her with every ounce of my heart and fiber in my body. I always have and I always will. But I knew she would try to get things to work out with the baby daddy because that's the father. And yes, she did try to do that. But I still loved her more than anything.

I met another woman online, I moved states again. I thought it was a good idea, give my life the adrenaline it needs, new life, new start, new state, new home, new girlfriend. Not even 5 months in, she confessed that she slept with a stranger on Craigslist to make money for Christmas gifts. It was a very very rocky relationship. I now had zero trust in many woman. I stayed with this woman for about 5 or 6 years. We did marry but I couldn't bring myself to forgive her after all that time. It made her aggressive and hateful towards me everyday. We ended up divorcing which is what I wanted and not her. We never had any children. But now I was stuck in this state with really no friends or anyone. My now fianc√© and I started talking again a few years after my divorce. I couldn't read between the lines, I didn't know she actually wanted something with me. Again, I'm messed up in the head. I was laid off a second time from the same company within a year of being hired. It was a really well paying job at Honeywell, and I was laid off, rehired, and laid off again. I also lived with a music producer and had a side gig of writing lyrics for him, we had an arrangement that I'd write for a year for him and  he'd hook me up with a few of his artists so I could write for them. A lot of things happened and he went back on his word and I came out with nothing to show for it. My now fianc√©, at the time we were talking again and she wanted to visit me, I ended up ghosting her because of all the bad things I complied in my mind of how much of a failure I've been my life. I actually tried to end myself and never told her until last year.

For her, every man she's ever been with has been awful to her (according to her). She claims she's been cheated on with every relationship. I choose to believe this. Her baby daddy still lives around only because of the child. And still to this day, he doesn't exactly care for his kid. 

She was dating some guy a few years back and ended up getting engaged. He was super controlling, narcissistic beyond beliefs. He made her pay for everything even on her birthdays. He also didn't care for her daughter and even yelled and belittled her mom in front of her. The man had 2 kids of his own and they treated the mom and her daughter like absolute trash every day.

My fianc√© claims she isn't beautiful, doesn't ever feel it. She is tall but somewhat overweight. I can see where she's coming from by saying that. But I absolutely love her more than anything, this same love has been growing since we were kids in school.

I moved back here to our state last year in July. We kind of rekindled and talked a little for some months. Then in December she decided to give me a chance. 

She is a CNA and works 12 hour shifts 3 days a week. She needs a lot of R&R after her last day of work. She needs a lot of time to herself. She's been doing this for 15 years and hates it, but I can't talk her out of looking for another career because she knows she's good at it.

I don't have a real family, just the friends who raised me as a kid. I consider them my parents and siblings. But I don't do much with them. I don't really have a life. I just work and pay my debts, maybe watch a few movies or play a video game or two. That's about it for my life right now. So I have nothing but free time if I'm not working. I offer her my help all the time and it annoys her. I offer to bring coffees or boba teas to her or her daughter whenever I'm coming over to visit or stay the night. I go out of my way to do anything and everything I can. I want her to know that she can count on me no matter if its financial, emotional, or physical.

Since December she has ended it with me twice, but we get back together a few days later. Sometimes she says I smother too much, and I have definitely worked on that. I no longer ask to come over, I leave it all up to her even though it hurts me. She'll make a joke like ""Are you coming over or what?"" and that's her way of inviting me over. I got frustrated with her last Saturday because she's been talking about weeding her house but I keep insisting on wanting to help her because her body isn't in good shape from lifting all her patients at the hospital. She's always in pain. She woke up early, never messaged or called me and was outside for 5 hours already weeding. She ended up calling me and I tried to act happy. I know its so stupid to be upset about. I always try to find ways to make life better and more comfortable for her. She noticed I was frustrated and mentioned that this is her house and her responsibilities, not mine. I shouldn't have to worry about having or wanting to help her.

I got her a mothers day gift, I wasn't trying to keep it as a surprise because I know what she'll say. Anyway, she told me it's not my responsibility to celebrate her mothers day, we don't have a child together. But... no one celebrates it with her. Even her mom is narcissistic and make it all about her. My fianc√© will end up going to her house to cook her food and get nothing in return, I always show her ways that I care and love her. I think I'm just too much.

Her and I went on vacation a few weeks back to Monterey, Ca. I proposed to her there. Of course I asked her daughter beforehand because it's her input and feelings I value the most when it comes to this life changing decision. Before I even got a chance to finish the question when asking her daughter for her blessing to marry her mother, she said yes. She knew what I was going to ask and didn't let me finish the question. She's had a tough life too, having a dad that doesn't care and basically a step dad that treated her poorly and also pretended she didn't exist. I want to show her that not all guys are like that. I think her daughter really does like me. Anyway, how did all this get started? I know I'm jumping all over the place.

A month ago, my fianc√© (girlfriend at the time) was at work and she said that everyone was just telling stories of their finances and husbands, they all had rings. They all have multiple children or working on it. It made her very sad. She said she felt robbed of her life or the time wasted with those other men. Eventually she showed me a few rings, a matching set of rings for male and female. She also showed me a good match for an engagement ring online.

So I buy them. I propose with her daughter there with us. Fianc√© has no idea what is happening. I have my proposal speech, I bend the knee and ask the question. And I get silence and hesitation. She did end up saying yes but we would have a lot to talk about. I ended up misreading that whole situation. I know I did it too soon. But I thought she wanted it now. She really didn't. We are still engaged. We don't live together.

I don't have a life or long lasting hobbies to occupy myself besides movies and games. I have so much anxiety everyday, wondering if she's going to leave me, or thinking how bad have I annoyed her today? I have had two marriages fall apart with cheating. I don't think she'll do that but I love her and have loved her since we were kids and I couldn't go on if this ever happened from her. We both have problems and I don't see them as that bad. I live in constant anxiety, I am very emotional and I sometimes get teary eye'd daily from my memories of the military. I think it bothers her. I have a mesh up of bad memories of military, marriages, and even her leaving constantly in the previous times we've dated.

She gets overwhelmed super easy, she doesn't have a single co dependent bone in her body, she is self sufficient/independent to the core. She hates it when I pay for things. And I pay for a lot of things. She says she secretly likes it but there are days she gets pissed. She says her past relationships never helped with anything, bills or food. So she likes to do it all herself and not rely on anyone.

Sometimes I get hurt when she only wants to spend time with her daughter for the weekend. And I get it. Yes, that's great! The both of you have been though some traumatic stuff. But I feel I'm allowed to feel a little sad about it. It's not like I make a scene or anything. She knows if I'm sad and it stresses her out,  but I can always watch a movie or go for a walk to pass time, it's okay.

She's afraid that I'll get bored of her or find someone better. She says I'm super attractive and I can get any woman. I've never felt like that, especially if my previous marriages ended in cheating. I try to give her all the time and space she wants and needs even if it hurts me. I don't ever want to give up on us. I truly love her and will never leave her. But she says things to me like ""it's not my responsibility to do this or that"". She also stated that we are on two different time waves. She's taking it super slow and I'm taking it super fast. Which I do see that. I try to help it. She is the one with the family/daughter and I am alone with nothing or no one take care of. I have nothing but time and I always want to see her. So I can see how this affects us and her thoughts. Even traumas and triggers of past relationships. She's always been told she's never good enough, never good to have their child, or that she's not pretty. I do all the things opposite. I tell her all the time how beautiful she is and it annoys her

A lot of the time it feels like I'm in a tug-of-war in this bi-polar thought process. I want to do the right thing, good by her and her daughter. I know I have left so much out and I will regret it when an hour from now I'll say ""ugh! this was important, I should have mentioned this"". I still have so much to say but I wanted to get most of the context out there to tell you where we are coming from internally and emotionally. Last week, she said she wanted to look for furniture for her house, a big dresser for her bedroom. One side for her and one side for me for whenever that time comes. And we could also put a big TV on top of it. I was dumb and got excited about that thought and topic that I brought it up the next day. It overwhelmed her we had a discussion about the way I am and how I take things too fast.

She says I'm the nicest person she's ever known and been with and it's very weird for her to have someone like me do the things I do. Then turns around and pretty much says she doesn't need me to do those things, or even need me.

Lately I've been feeling that maybe we need to hold off on the engagement. Give us a break and give her more time to heal. But she's told me that she thinks she will never fully heal and will be like this maybe forever. When I say a break, I don't mean I'm going to search for someone else. I will always be here waiting for her. Especially now that we are both close to our 40's. We've been trying for a baby for a few months and she doesn't think her body will let her have one, I'm not sure if there are any reasons in there on how she treats me or pushes me away sometimes.

I don't want to take a break, I fear that things will fall apart even more and it scares me to death. I know healing is a long process and even I still need a lot of it. I know I need therapy and hobbies. I've listened to many self help type books. I don't mean to ever make it feel like I'm pushy or escalating things faster than they should.

I am torn between staying where I am, keeping my distance. Pretty much having her make all the shots and calls. She's the one limited on free time. Or I can be the bigger person and let her go and give her more time to heal.

TLDR Exam breakdown:

Didn‚Äôt feel too hard, 6-7 drag and drop, a few select multiples, 1-2 EV (no calculation), 1-2 PERT, 1-2 CP, 1 MBTI

**Background:**

If it helps, I‚Äôve been working at a marketing agency as a producer full time for almost 4 years.

I first heard about the PMP cert when my first annual review at work came up and it was suggested to me from my immediate supervisor at the time in summer 2022. I had worked as a producer for a year at that point plus some experience from grad school, but I would‚Äôve needed to get the CAPM instead of the PMP at that time. So browsed this sub, got AR‚Äôs CAPM Udemy course, got through the first bit of it and immediately got scared of the 49 processes! lol. Life happened, work got busy so I decided it wasn‚Äôt really for me and tabled it. More annual review happened and I felt not great about saying that I just decided that the course is not for me. It got brought up even by the CEO since one of the best performing ppl does have the PMP here, lol.¬†

Fast forward to 2025, the thought of the PMP is still lingering on my mind and I‚Äôve gotten married and are thinking about taking some next steps in life. After reading through the experiences of a few parents in this sub (kudos to y‚Äôall!!!) I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs something I want to try to get done before kids arrive in my life. The reason was also compounded by work having 2 rounds of reductions in the last 2 years and me feeling constantly like I‚Äôll be the next one to go if it‚Äôll happens again (but srsly definitely this time).¬†

**Taking the course: (3/8/25-3/26/25)**

I bought AR Udemy PMP course on sale for my 35PDUs. And then I found out you can get the book and get the course for free, oh well. I also made a plan based on AR‚Äôs 30 day study plan, but it was more like 2 months in retrospect. I wished I spent some more time going through the predictive planning section and watched it a few more times as it was SO dense, but overall I followed the plan pretty much to a T when it comes to completing the course. Having the book helped me a ton.

**Watching supplemental videos, prepping for application: (3/26/25-4/12/25)**

I had a little bit of time between finishing the course and submitting the application. The person who helped me with the application was super busy so I took some time in between and waited a bit. I submitted my app, purchased Study Hall plus after that, got approved to take exam exactly a week later. In the meantime I browsed this sub and started checking out some other AR and DM videos.

**Application passed, Exam prep officially begins: (4/13/25-5/7/25)**

With the application approved, I wanted to take this exam before my honeymoon trip in late May and the spot that worked out the best was 5/9. It helped that I had to spend money to move exam dates because I am super cheap loll!

**Study Hall**

After I registered for the test, I started going through all the content on SH. In my case I really did feel like SH Plus helped me a lot as I took a ton of tests and mock tests before the tests and felt like that quantity is important, plus I heard people say that the exam was really hard right before I took it, so it really helped at least mentally to have those expert question to look through. I scored about 74% on Exams 1-3 and 61% on Exams 4-5 with remarkable consistency, lol, and all with about 81% without expert questions.¬†Mini exams I went anywhere between 53% to 93%. I took them in the following order: Exam 1, 4, 3, 5, 2. It helped me to get an accurate gauge of my knowledge right off the bat with Exam 1 and realizing how hard things could be with Exam 4, and exposed a lot of knowledge areas that I felt lacking in. I also had to do almost all of the mock exams after work and workout (which usually lands me at 9:30pm local time), so it was a pain to get through some of these to say the least.

**Youtube & Other Resources**

I supplemented with mostly DM and AR‚Äôs videos on YouTube. I first started with [AR's Ultra Hard questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sWpc6765AI&t=660s&pp=ygUdYW5kcmV3IHJhbWRheWFsIDIwMCBxdWVzdGlvbnM%3D), but switched gears halfway through when I felt like I was getting a more thorough understanding through DM's videos. I felt like I‚Äôm lacking a bit when it comes to the 49 processes, so I prioritized finishing DM's [PMBOK6 video based on process groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIH-u81XCxM). Then I watched half of [DM's PMBOK7 videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zht0-j03NfQ&t=10480s) and about [20 of DM's agile 200 questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNIHysh2ZW4&t=2070s). I did all of [AR's 100 Drag and Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7J4WGbR9Ig&t=1s&pp=ygUdYW5kcmV3IHJhbWRheWFsIGRyYWcgYW5kIGRyb3A%3D) first, and [DM's 110 Drag and Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwNUBe21jtM&t=4050s). I felt like was DM's videos were incredibly thorough, maybe a bit too thorough as there's a few agile topics that I wasn't too familiar with.

I watched these videos: [MR mindset video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOKpDPRfkvo), [DM PMP Fast Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUOJ_yEeyuc) & [Cheat sheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k25eJDUU-J0&t=287s) which I did find helpful. It was during the last week before I took the exam so it didn't feel as help as it maybe could've been when I just finished the course, but still helpful nonetheless. One of DM's videos suggested you divide exam section time with 60/75/95 and I did something incredibly similar to that.

I also got the [Third rock study notes](https://third3rockpmp.com/). It was really nice and helpful to have all the stuff aggregated into one place like it did. I read it to myself every night before I fell sleep, lol.

**Cumulative Error Log**

What I felt like was qqually important, if not more, was keeping [my own cumulative error log.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12QXtuSmKvC5RJHGZirEIV5CWCRHtJtBo/edit?gid=1166607590#gid=1166607590) I came across  [this post by r/Mountain\_hospital\_75](https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1ic39k1/passed_my_pmp_in_4_weeks_with_3_ats_on_my_first/) about keep a log of questions you got incorrect, and the rules of threes: **Understand the mistake, Rewatch the relevant topic videos from AR‚Äôs course on Udemy, Review notes and summary of that topic.** I mainly tried to just do the first one, understand the mistake and I think even just that helped immensely. I logged SH question as well as all the YT video questions that I was doing in there.

**AI Assistance**

Sometimes SH would have incomplete answers so I would copy past this into Gen AI to help me with understanding my mistakes. Over time I've learned that sometimes AI would make my mistakes too! I would first copy past the question to AI, ask what it thinks, then ask when it thinks this why (if it's correct), or provide it with the correct answer and have it explain it to me. Which helps, I feel.

I didn't feel a glaring difference between Grok 3 and Gemini 2.0.

**Day before exam (5/8/25)**

The day before the exam I got up about 2 hours earlier than I would and read Third Rock notes. Went to work for a half day and took the second half of the day off to study. I went through the 50 some drag and drop I haven't finished from DM, went through the most recently taken Exam 2 questions that I have gotten incorrectly (at that time I was just trying to get through & understand so I didn't take more notes). Looked up on advice of what to expect on the day of the exam (was trying to figure out if I can eat a snack during break etc). Went to a nicely priced date night dinner in my city. Did some more DM PMBOK7 questions before hitting the sack.

**Judgement Day (5/9/25)**

Woke up early after not getting the greatest sleep and listened to the PMP fast track and cheat sheet videos. I usually do intermittent fasting until 3pm, so it was weird to have to eat a breakfast, especially one big enough to last you 4 hours for an exhausting exam. I had soft boiled eggs, PB&J sandwich, handful of chocolate covered coffee beans and half an apple, brought some chocolate cover pecans and a coconut water with me to the test center while not sure about whether I can access them. Wore a blue shirt, blue jeans and blue hoodie to the exam.

I was fully ready for the exam center to be blastingly cold as they usually are but the one in OKC actually wasn't bad at all. I got there early, got checked in and pretty much just started without needing to wait till my appointment time. I divvyed up my section lengths so it's a bit like 62 minutes, 75 minutes, then 93 minutes (corresponding to having 170, 95 minutes left - had to do the math during the exam lol!)

Overall I felt like the exam was about on par/maybe slightly easier than SH as I felt like I had a relative smooth time. In each section I had a little bit of time to review flagged questions (i flagged about 11 in the first one, then 8 in the two others), and some of the other sections, with first section being the tightest one due to the time.

I encountered about 6-7 drag and drop questions and felt a lot of it was harder than the AR/DM videos I watched, being more situational, and I found the wording to be a bit confusing. I had about 1-2 Earned value management questions, but no calculations. Same thing with PERT as well as CP. Had 1 MBTI question.

Took both of my breaks to use restroom, drink water and eat snacks.

I finished the exam with about 10 minutes left on the clock, did the survey, with the printout getting the provisional pass!

**The day after**

I spent the night doing absolutely nothing other than watching Youtube videos which I missed :P

I got my scorecard today and a badge from Credly.

Getting some desserts of choice today, because carrot cake is not usually my favorite :P

**Conclusion**  
That was incredibly long and I didn't think it'll get nearly as long as it would! But I hope this would help somebody who is stressing about the exam. Being at the exam center put me back to when I was taking my driver's exam for the 3rd time, being so worried and anxious that I will fail, once again. It was a journey, with the seed of taking this exam being planted almost 3 years ago now, getting scared of it, to now actually taking this exam and passing it.

If I can do it, so can you, and I hope this post will help someone out there!",1,1746898812.0,pmp,0,1.0,False

Reading all the posts has really helped me understand what to expect during the process. I got my rating decision for 50 % PTSD a couple days ago, after putting in an intent to file in April 2024, finally getting three Buddy statements and my own recollections together and submitted on  February 5, 2025. I can't say how much this has changed my opinion of the VA for the positive. I fully expected a denial, and you have to fight for a fair rating. That was not even close to how it went. For anyone just getting started, my only advice (re: PTSD) is to put in an intent to file, call the VFW and ask them for help (the office at Page Avenue in STL is filled with helpful folks, unsure of other offices or if they help nationally) starting your paperwork. Then, take your time with writing out your experiences, and gathering corroborating statements from your service buddies, family/friends/coworkers who know how you've been effected, then send it in sometime before a year after you filled your intent to file. Can't hurt to send it certified mail, and download the va claim tracker. Expect it to take about six months or so (at the moment) to get a rating after they get it.

Reading the experiences of everyone who has posted has helped ease my anxiety in that it helped me temper my expectations re: the timeline.

1kjfs5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MamaLane/comments/1kjfs5l/mama_san_fran_story/,Mama San Fran story,"The Embarcadero bustled with end-of-day foot traffic, but San Francisco didn't mind the noise. Her boots clacked against the cobblestones, and her kid's small hand fit snug in hers. Overhead, the old Bay Bridge loomed through the mist like a monument to half-formed promises. Somewhere, a man with a guitar played a song that was older than the whole lot of people there.

Shore leave was a welcome blessing, even if her puddin' wasn't as lucky‚Äîit still gave her the chance to take their little girl to see her old stomping grounds. Her namesake, the heart of NorCal. Once a bastion of counterculture, now home of overpriced coffee and yuppies with power ties.

Her kid was not restless, but the girl's eyes wandered up to the street signs and the buildings above, trying to find the name of her hometown in the sea of unfamiliar letters.

""You can smell the ocean before you see it,"" she told her kid. ""And hear the seagulls yellin' like they're runnin' the place.""

And couple that with the ding-ding of streetcars that seemed to have come from another age, and the old-style buildings and restaurants with their brightly painted signs. The distant foghorn on the Bay and the occasional sound of a tugboat. Her kind of chaos.

She might not look like it, but being here could bring out the sentimentality in her. Like right now. And if she was gonna be sappy, then she'd go all out. She let her girl go and then knelt down to the child's level. The girl's eyes went wide with anticipation.

""Ey, li'l puddin', you can go wanderin', but not too far, 'kay? Till your daddy gets back from his mission, I don't wanna have him worried sick.""

""Mmkay.""

""And remember what I said. If someone's bein' mean to you, give 'em a swift kick in the shins, got it? As hard as you can.""

""Okay!""

""Now that's a good girl,"" San Francisco chuckled, and gave her kid a kiss on the cheek. Not a quick peck. Sometimes she liked the long, lingering ones. Shocking, maybe. But it was true. That way, it was less easy to forget about the feeling.

The little one soon wandered off, but being the obedient daughter she was, she stuck close by. She took after her father more instead of, in his words, his gremlin of a wife. The nerve of that man.

But maybe he's got a point. Maybe.

A small part of her wanted to go chasing after her, but she decided not to be a helicopter mom and let the child explore. A freedom lover denying her child the same was just plain stupid. ""Hypo‚Äîwhat's the word‚Äîhypocritical. Yeah.""

So she settled with eyeing the girl's every movement. And maybe keeping an eye out for any creeps. Who knows? A kick to the shin might not do the trick.

The girl spoke to a lot of the locals, who, questionable attire aside, seemed harmless. The buskers gracefully accepted what little she had to give. A grumpy businessman who seemed to be in a rush pointedly ignored her. ""The treehugger in the tie-dyed robe‚Äîbright enough to look like a rainbow tarp‚Äîstood out in this age of hyperconsumerism. His granddaddy would've had a conniption. He probably smelled like ganja. He smiled and handed her a crown of flower petals, which the kid happily wore. Probably sent her off with some ""peace and love"" too. At least he's sensible enough to just leave a kid flowers, not something that would cause her to wake up three days later somewhere she didn't want to be.

Come to think of it, that brought back some good memories.

1967, when the streets of Haight-Ashbury were full of long-haired hippies, their clothes dyed with all sorts of colors, and they'd gather around the park, listening to bands like Jefferson Airplane. And they'd wear flowers on their heads.

Just like that very pleased flower child, running toward her like a burst of sunshine chasing away the fog.

""Mommy, mommy! That nice man gave me a flower crown!""

San Francisco knelt down again and held her daughter's hands, letting the girl twirl around to show off her new accessory.

She didn't know what flowers were in that crown. They all looked the same to her anyway. She didn't know the meaning behind those colorful blooms either. But, in a way, she felt like she didn't need to. After all, symbols only had power when they were acknowledged. And she would make sure her child knew them well.

She smiled and said, ""It's beautiful, li'l puddin'.""

That's her flower child.

""Ehehe... Thank you, mommy!""

""Y'know, your dad would love to see you wearin' that. So take good care of it until he gets here.""

""Mmhm! I'll keep it forever! But...""

""Hm?""

""Daddy likes flowers, too? But he's never told me.""

""Of course he does, sweetie. It's just... You can't tell a guy like him that he's a flower guy. He's got a reputation, y'know?""

""Ehhh...? I don't get it, mommy.""

""Oh, there's a funny story about it. I'll tell you when we get to our next stop, 'kay?""

**\*\*\***

The Haight-Ashbury neighborhood was home to so many shops, cafes, and other establishments that it was a wonder the place didn't collapse from the weight of the money in the air.

She waited as her girl marveled at the Grateful Dead House, the psychedelic graffiti and murals, and the antique shops.

""So what's the story, mommy?""

""Alright, puddin'. I'll tell ya, but don't tell daddy I told you this, 'kay?""

""I won't!""

""Good girl.""

And she thought. Where to start.

""You know, back in 1967, this place was waaaay different. It was Summer. Free hugs, peace signs, bad poetry, flowers in your hair. People who thought takin' a bath was too mainstream. Protest signs, too. A whole lotta people trying to change the world. It was a crazy, wild, wonderful time. Dancing barefoot. High on life.""

""Sounds fun, mommy!""

""And it was. I snuck here during a shore leave. I wasn't tryin' to fit in. Just watching. Got roped in anyway, hahaha! Pretty fun. They called me Sister Frannie, didn't care who I was, just a new face among the crowd. They were all a bunch of peace freaks, thinkin' the world could be fixed with hugs and some, uh... let's call it enhanced spiritual insight.""

""...Huh?""

""Acid trips, sweetie.""

""They...drank battery acid?""

It was an earnest question, and San Francisco had to fight back the urge to laugh and roll on the ground like a maniac.

But a smart girl deserved nothing less than a good explanation. No sugarcoating. Maybe a little abridged, but no lies.

""Oh, sugar, no! Not, like, battery acid! I mean...LSD. Psychedelics. Mind stuff. Bad for you, don't touch it till you're thirty. Thirty *thousand* years old.""

""Ewww. Sounds gross.""

She leaned in close to her girl's ear.

""... Don't tell daddy, but I kinda did it, once. I mean, not that I did it on purpose, but they tricked me into doin' it, and...""

""Was it scary?""

""... I'm a shipgirl, so all I had was mild annoyance, ha! I did eat four funnel cakes, though. That was pretty spiritual. Your daddy..uh, at that time, we're not hitched yet, wasn't very thrilled when I came back smellin' of patchouli and smoke. He said the flowers were nice, though, named them all, then quickly changed the topic.""

""Why? Did he hate the hippies?""

""Not really. It's just a little embarrassing for him to admit that he was a flower guy. That's why you have to keep quiet. I don't know why, but he just likes to pretend he hates them. Like he thinks they're not worth the effort.""

The look of betrayal in her child's eyes was amusing. She certainly inherited her mother's penchant for drama.

""No way! So it wasn't you?""

""Honey, do I look like someone who keeps flowers in the house? It was him, though; he's just too embarrassed. He loves flowers, but he just doesn't say it. It's a guy thing.""

""Daddy's silly. I'll have to give him a bunch of flowers!""

""Yeah, girl, go get him. Give him all the flowers, then hug him 'til he can't breathe. Or maybe a little. Don't want him to faint, after all.""

""O-kaaay!""

""Now, wanna grab some ice cream?""

""Can I?""

""Well, what kind of mom would I be if I said no, puddin'?""

""Ehehe. Yay!""

She could still hear Scott McKenzie singing, even now.

*If you're going to San Francisco,*

*Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair.*

People are in motion, just like before. Maybe a little less gentle. Still beautiful.

For her li'l puddin' who wasn't there, she'll give a different kind of peace.

For her puddin', who was somewhere in the Pacific, all this, and a bit more.

1kjfro3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kjfro3/i_30f_just_found_out_that_a_year_and_a_half_ago/,I (30F) just found out that a year and a half ago my partner (34M) brought his ex into our apartment for a brunch while I was out with my friends while I found out multiple pictures of him and his ex are saved in the cloud. What do I say to him about this?,"Throwaway account because my partner and my friends are also on Reddit and follow my main account, I don't want this to trace back to my main as I want to figure out the best solution for my situation.

I (30F) was in a relationship with James (34M, fake name) from 2019 till 2021. We were long distance because I'm from Asia and he is from Northen Europe and covid was a big issue so in short James cheated on me with Cecilia from his country and I dumped him so he ended up with Cecilia as she was already friends of the family (fake names as well). Fast forward to 2022, Cecilia dumped James for Nicholas, another friend of the big family. From what James told me, ""Nicholas was ready to marry Cecilia and to give her more"".

In the early of 2023, James and I met again completely unexpected and we had a few coffee dates together then decided to give each other another go. I have been honest with James that last time during Covid when I just moved to Germany, he really hurt me and the trust is broken so bad that he needed to work very hard to build that trust again. Our relationship is not perfect but I prepared myself for anything after the first time but what I didn't prepare myself was to see so many pictures between James and Cecilia in his phone, very intimate pictures. I did not snoop because we both know each other's phone code but when I was looking at the pictures, it shows the memories reminder. I was shocked and didn't know what to say. James was not aware of what I saw and when he knew what happened, I was on the verge of crying and I could not say anything.

When I saw the memories reminder, I went and saw that the latest picture they took together was a week before I moved in with him. A lot of ""happy memories"" as if he did not wanted to let Cecilia go but 2 months after breaking up with James, Cecilia already started dating Nicholas. By the time Cecilia visited our place, she was egaged to Nicholas. I don't have issues with James keeping some pictures but these pictures were very explicit and I don't expect a memories reminder to pop out. In a moment of rage and shock, I deleted one of the pictures and also Cecilia's phone number.

Just last week I moved across the country to live with my sister, and last night she was letting the dogs outside and one of my cats slipped out. Despite him being an indoor cat, he always tries to go outside and sometimes gets out. At my previous home, he'd of course always return home and I'd find him by the door. This is his first time being outside here, and it's thousands of miles away from our old house. Immediately after he escaped, we saw him run into the woods behind her house and tried getting treats and calling him but no luck. We put his litter box and some food on the deck, hoping to see him outside in the morning. 

This morning I didn't see him,  so I called for him and nothing. I let the dogs out, made coffee, etc and called for him again about 20 minutes later and heard him in the woods behind her house. I recognized his meowing, as he is very vocal. I would call him and he would meow and I was trying to search for him but couldn't locate him. I ran inside, woke my sister and we went back out. He meowed some more but we had no luck finding him. She lives in Washington state, so it is very woodsy. We looked in trees and bushes to no avail. He eventually stopped meowing when I would call for him. I heard some of the neighbors out, so I'm hoping he just got spooked. She's reached out to the neighbors to keep an eye out for him. It's been a few hours and I keep calling him and hear nothing. 

I'm worried sick and not sure what to do other than to wait it out, and continue searching. Any advice would be appreciated.",1,1746898327.0,cats,0,1.0,False

In fact, I've seen people on this subreddit call us a possible money laundering operation, so I want to make sure people know what we are about! We are all about artisanal baked goods, made with local flour from Janie's Mill as well as whatever other local ingredients I can find. 

Our Sourdough and Croissants are great examples of our dedication to our craft, with our Pistachio Croissants being a bit of a signature item. We also focus very heavily on Gluten-free and Vegan products, taking great care to provide delicious and safe treats for all to enjoy. Our gf/v donuts are a huge hit, and I think the gf/v chocolate chip cookies are better than any flour and egg cookie I've ever had. Lately, we've had more of a focus on savory gf/v goods, like focaccia and pretzels. Most recently, we launched a soup and sandwich menu, made on our sourdough, featuring meat smoked over at Westside Smoke and cheese from Ropp Dairy Farm. The brisket reuben is so good!

For coffee, we proudly serve Intuition from over in Peoria, my favorite roaster in the surrounding area. If you ever find yourself in Peoria, we also provide all their pastries and sourdough as well! 

In any case, I hope you'll come try us out for coffee, lunch, or just a quick snack! We are in the old Pizza Hut building by Garden of Paradise.",20,1746898090.0,BloomingtonNormal,6,0.95,False

We hang our semi-often too, usually at coffee shops or restaurants.

After I had asked for her number, maybe a week or two after we became friends, she told me that she wasn't ready for a relationship and didn't really want one either, but that was 7 months ago and I'm not sure if that has changed or not.

some small changes in her messages have made me question whether or not she's as interested in me as I am in her. for instance sometimes she'll add a ‚ò∫Ô∏è or üòä emoji to goodbye messages, which is a lot different from her messages in the past. Stuff like that is what sparked my last relationship so I'm not sure if it's the same here.

Another reason that makes me question her view of me is that she even accepts my offers to hangout at all. She dislikes coffee but agreed to going to a coffee shop with me, obviously she got something else but it's still confuses me why she didn't suggest to go somewhere else.

I'm also quite unattractive, at least I think, which makes me doubt that she's interested, but whenever I make a joke about about it or my weight she'll outright disagree and shout 'no!' (They're usually amazing jokes too :( . )

I don't know whether or not to confess my own feelings to her or just leave it be. I value her quite a lot as a friend so I'd hate to make things awkward between us.

‚ö†Ô∏è \*\*Content Warnings:\*\* Graphic body horror, execution, pressure trauma, eye trauma, dark humor, mild profanity, references to genocide

\> A disgraced military strategist is sentenced to fall into the crushing atmosphere of a gas giant. Told in alternating POVs with gallows wit, tactical coffee, and pressure-induced regret.

# Terminal Descent

*Inspired by the style of John Scalzi*

# ""The Airlock Decision"" ‚Äì Pre-Descent Confrontation

The door to the brig hissed open, and Captain Elira Vale stepped inside like a thundercloud with a badge. Behind her, two armed guards flanked the entrance. Halverson didn‚Äôt look up from his cot. He was seated casually, as if this were a diplomatic lounge and not the last room he‚Äôd ever see with a ceiling.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre early,‚Äù he said, adjusting his collar. ‚ÄúI expected a tribunal. A chance to explain‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo tribunal,‚Äù Vale said. ‚ÄúJust the airlock.‚Äù

Halverson finally looked up. ‚ÄúYou're kidding.‚Äù

Vale didn‚Äôt blink. ‚ÄúDo I look like I‚Äôm in the mood for satire?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to execute a senior strategist without trial. That‚Äôs a war crime.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou authorized a kinetic orbital strike on civilians for broadcasting jazz.‚Äù She tilted her head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs *weird*.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were communicating in subharmonics. The potential for memetic incursion‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄîWas bullshit,‚Äù Vale snapped. ‚ÄúAnd even if it weren‚Äôt, you don‚Äôt get to sterilize entire settlements over dissonant sax solos.‚Äù

Halverson stood, smoothing his uniform. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll regret this. I know things. Layers you haven‚Äôt even imagined.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you do,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou can scream them into the hydrogen soup on your way down.‚Äù

The guards moved in. Halverson stepped back, suddenly pale.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll lose everything without me.‚Äù

Vale leaned in. ‚ÄúWe already did. Because of you.‚Äù

# ""The Long Fall"" ‚Äì Hero‚Äôs Perspective

From orbit, gas giants look beautiful. Majestic. Swirly. Like God really got into abstract art and ran out of canvas.

From orbit, they also look a lot like a toilet for bad decisions.

I stood on the bridge of the *Aldrin‚Äôs Fist* and watched our former Chief Strategist take a long, terminal dive into Zeta B-9‚Äôs upper atmosphere. He wasn‚Äôt in a pod, by the way. Pods are for people we might want to fish out later. He had a reentry suit, a datapad full of secrets, and about five minutes of smug left in him before the pressure would turn his ego into a well-distributed red mist.

‚ÄúStill tracking him?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúBeacon just hit the 90-kilometer mark,‚Äù Lieutenant Garn said. ‚ÄúTemperature‚Äôs spiking. Suit integrity‚Äôs down to 62%.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo he‚Äôll be dead soon?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Garn replied, ‚Äúthe good news is he‚Äôs already screaming. So, probably yes.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúCool.‚Äù

You might think this was a bit cold of me. And hey ‚Äî valid. But this was the guy who greenlit a mass driver strike on a terraforming colony because the local crustacean analogs were sending weird radio signals. And if that sounds like a villainous clich√©, congrats ‚Äî you‚Äôve met Rear Strategist Halverson. He played 5D chess while everyone else was busy trying not to die in 3D space.

And now, Halverson was falling into the crushing, boiling, reality-checking bowels of a planet that hadn‚Äôt given a damn about human ambition since the beginning of time.

‚ÄúAtmospheric pressure just hit 80 bar,‚Äù Garn said. ‚ÄúSuit‚Äôs rupturing. Heart rate spike annnnnd... flatline.‚Äù

There was a moment of quiet on the bridge. Professional quiet. The kind that says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad that genocidal asshole‚Äôs gone, but we also know someone‚Äôs going to ask for the paperwork.‚Äù

‚ÄúLog it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNotify High Command. Use the words ‚Äòstrategic correction.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúAye, Captain.‚Äù

I watched the last flicker of the beacon blink out, swallowed by roiling clouds and the kind of gravity that doesn‚Äôt negotiate.

Somewhere down there, Halverson was part of the planet now. Probably still trying to explain to the hydrogen why the ends justified the means.

‚ÄúPlot course for Vesper‚Äôs Reach,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd someone get me a coffee. The kind without lies in it.‚Äù

# ""Strategic Correction"" ‚Äì Halverson‚Äôs Final Descent

Okay. Okay. This isn‚Äôt ideal.

But it‚Äôs not unmanageable.

They threw me out an airlock. Sure. No trial, no ceremony. Not even a clever monologue from Vale ‚Äî which I had *expected*, frankly. I had a whole retort ready. Something about flawed ideology and inferior command structures.

Never got to use it.

Now I‚Äôm falling.

Terminal velocity hit about five minutes ago. Zeta B-9‚Äôs upper atmosphere is thick enough to slow a warship, but I‚Äôm slicing through it like a dart made of failure and reentry-grade polymers. The suit‚Äôs holding. For now. Heads-up display shows exterior temperature climbing. Pressure? Also climbing. Internal humidity? That‚Äôs me, sweating.

I‚Äôve run simulations. I know how this goes.

About 60 kilometers in, the atmosphere stops being friendly and starts playing ‚Äúcrush-the-soft-organics.‚Äù That's the line where gasses start behaving like fluids. That‚Äôs when the real fun begins.

My ears pop. Then they pop *again*.

Pressure alarm chirps.

**Suit Integrity: 84%**  
**Estimated Time to Critical Failure: 03:12**

Shit.

My fingernails are tingling. That‚Äôs blood pooling where it shouldn‚Äôt. My joints ache. My kneecaps feel like they‚Äôre trying to climb up my thighs.

The beacon‚Äôs still transmitting. That‚Äôs good. Maybe someone‚Äôll rescue me. Maybe they‚Äôll want answers. Maybe this is all part of a higher-level strategy.

Then my left eye bursts.

Just‚Äîpop. Like a grape under a thumb. No warning. No fanfare. Just sudden warmth inside the helmet, followed by impaired depth perception and a distinct lack of symmetry.

**Suit Integrity: 59%**  
**Warning: Internal Trauma Detected**

‚ÄúNo shit,‚Äù I mutter. Or try to. Comes out wet.

My ribs feel *slushy*. Not broken ‚Äî not yet ‚Äî but like they‚Äôre thinking about it. The pressure differential is squeezing my insides like toothpaste. I can *hear* my blood moving. It sounds... frothy.

Suddenly, I get it.

The philosophers always said death would bring clarity. I thought they meant some noble metaphysical understanding.

Turns out it‚Äôs just the brain realizing the meat around it is about to rupture like a microwaved sausage.

**Suit Integrity: 31%**

I hallucinate a desk. My desk. The one on the command ship where I signed the Colony Strike Authorization. The leather‚Äôs red, like blood, like the walls of the lungs I can‚Äôt inflate anymore.

Gods, my *bones* itch. Do bones itch?

My spine feels like it‚Äôs unscrewing itself from my skull.

**Suit Failure Imminent**

Then‚Äî

**Suit Integrity: 0%**

The planet enters me like a lover with no sense of boundaries. The pressure crushes my chest. My lungs invert. My stomach herniates through my esophagus. My other eye explodes.

I am melting.  
I am imploding.  
I am becoming *part* of this gas giant‚Äôs weather pattern.

And I realize‚Äî

This isn‚Äôt a death.

It‚Äôs an *absorption*.

# ""Postscript"" ‚Äì Aboard Aldrin‚Äôs Fist

‚ÄúCaptain?‚Äù Ensign Darella asked, cautiously.

Captain Vale didn‚Äôt look up. She was halfway through her coffee, the kind she specifically requested to be made *without lies*. No synthmilk. No politics. No mission briefings in the foam.

Just caffeine and the distant comfort of orbital detachment.

‚ÄúMm?‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt that a little... harsh?‚Äù

Vale blinked once, slowly. Like a cat considering how much effort it would take to deal with an insect.

‚ÄúHe authorized the kinetic sterilization of a civilian habitat because the locals broadcasted jazz at 240 hertz,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe called it a ‚Äòpreemptive cultural quarantine.‚Äô‚Äù

Darella shifted on her feet. ‚ÄúRight. It‚Äôs just... I read the telemetry.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Vale sipped.

‚ÄúHis body hit internal liquefaction just past the 70-kilometer mark. And the signal‚Äî‚Äù she paused, consulting her datapad, ‚Äú‚Äîkept broadcasting pressure screams for another forty-two seconds.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impressive,‚Äù Vale said.

‚ÄúImpressive, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù

Vale set the mug down.

‚ÄúForty-two seconds of regret is more than I expected from him.‚Äù

Darella nodded. ‚ÄúUnderstood, Captain.‚Äù

They both stared silently out the viewport, watching as the gas giant rotated lazily beneath them ‚Äî a storm still churning where Halverson had vanished.

A soft burble escaped the coffee mug.

My partner has two SD16 and SS17. SS has a job and bought Mother's Day gifts with his own money. SD gets allowance and last year, my partner paid for her MD gift to her mom. Historically, he has always let them pick out something for her on Mother's Day. I don't much like it, but I understand it. I don't want him spending ANY of his money on her. So last year, BM complained to SD about having to purchase Fathers Day gifts, said SD should've saved her allowance and bought it herself. She tells her dad this. Of course, it hurt his feelings. 

Even so, this year he still took them out to go MD gift shopping for her. Granted, he maybe spends $50, if that. But after last year and what she said, I don't think he should spend a dime on her. 

Bonus complaint: I saw one of the things they got her and it really chaps my hide. There's a certain series that I am and have been obsessed with LONG before I met him.

1kjfbc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kjfbc7/my_bst_friend_just_ended_our_7_years_friendship/,My bst friend just ended our 7 years friendship,"Well, I feel pretty awful and I just need to speak to the void I guess. Sorry if this the wrong place. 

Some context; I(20F) and my friend(21F) have been friends since our first year of high school, and now we are both in different universities. We became friends cus we were deskmates and would spend time after school eating instant ramen and watching sitcoms. After our first year we became roommates as well, and I was pretty sure I struck gold by finding a friend like her.
I watched her become more self assured in her life over the years; we shared our struggles and cared for each other, I felt as if friendship with her was what it really supposed to be like. She was the ONLY person I've ever felt comfortable calling my best friend. I used to feel unlovable and ""not worth being around"", but not with her. I knew her parents and she knew mine, we went on holidays etc.. I could go on and talk about how special that bond - and she- was to me but you get the idea. 

So onto today's events:
I am gay, I had my first real crush on a girl from my class in the first year of hs, but at that time i didn't understand what the implications of that was. I simply thought it was a one time thing (call me slow I guess), after all we were in a religious school and our class only had girls.
 The point is I realized that I was gay (or put the label on myself) very late and was pretty depressed about it for a long time. It took me a long time and a push from our other roommate to tell my best friend this, and she was surprisingly kinda chill about it. It was about 3 years ago, since then we had lengthy conversations about it and she told me she was against it (because of religion) but that I was her friend and it would not change our friendship. I was happy, I now realize that I was an idiot for believing that friendship could survive  but I thought seeing me as a normal human just like her would change her opinion of queer people as a ""sin"" or sth. Apparently she thought the opposite; that I could ""change back"" and come back to the rightful path. Well I had a date with another girl last week, I knew she was uncomfortable with the topic so I didn't outright tell her about how it went but I mentioned it in passing & talked with another friend in a group chat etc. Mind you my date was just eating dinner and then walking around with the girl, nothing explicit or sexual. Anyways, turns out she had been considering and searching about whether she was committing sins by being my friend and apparently me going on a date solidified that I would not change back, so she decided to end it. I was so shocked when she said it, we were drinking coffee one moment and talking about usual shit and the next moment she says that. Cue a tearful, long conversation about the hows and the whys. To not make this post any longer than it already is I am not giving details about that convo but it went as you can probably imagine. We hugged one last time, both cried and wished each other well and she left. 

I truly have no ill feelings towards her but I am devastated. The ONE PERSON who I thought would never leave, left. I have this huge empty space in my chest and its terrifying. I dont know what to do, we have a lot of mutual friends (all of them religious and not aware I am gay) and now I have to come out to them to explain why we are not friends anymore. They will most certainly make the same decision as my old best friend and cut ties with me. I have other friends, I wont be alone when they leave, but these people meant the world to me and it is crushing me. I didn't choose to be born gay, so why do I have to suffer and lose friends because of it? Because I refuse to bottle it up and not act on it? Because I dont want to die alone and went on a date? I don't know, my head has been a mess since our talk and many unpleasant thoughts have made themselves present in my mind. I feel like I am spiraling into a dark place again, and that I've lost my ability to make connections with people permanently.
 I talked with some supportive friends from university who know and fully accept me but that empty space is still there, I really dont know what to do. I am sorry for the long rant, I am just really, really lost and afraid. I dont want this to cause me to do unhealthy and unsound life choices but I also dont know the right/healthy way to deal with this. Stay safe yall, thank you for reading

1kjfa04,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kjfa04/how_does_the_zlinke_geshini_ice_maker_perform/,How does the Zlinke Geshini Ice Maker perform? Detailed review inside!,"The Zlinke Geshini Ice Maker, model B0D3XFGQB5, has been my go-to gadget for weeks now, a staple at family gatherings, and even during those late-night iced coffee cravings. Testing this device daily has given me ample opportunity to dive deep into its features, quirks, and overall performance. As a countertop ice maker, its sleek, modern design and functionality came across as very promising from day one. Here's what stood out to me.

**Compact Yet Stylish Design**  
Right out of the box, its aesthetic was a definite head-turner. It‚Äôs compact at just 12 inches by 9 inches and fits cozily on my counter without taking up an unreasonable amount of space. The black finish blends well with most kitchen d√©cors, from minimalist to industrial. Despite its small footprint, it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy‚Äîit exudes a robust build quality that reassures longevity. Plus, thanks to its 13.85-pound lightweight nature, I found it easy to move between my kitchen and patio, which is a golden feature for someone who loves relocating devices for events. 

**Efficient and Reliable Performance**  
Let me tell you, this machine churns out ice faster than I expected. It took about six to eight minutes to spit out nine little bullet-shaped cubes during each cycle‚Äîperfectly sized for my soda and cocktails. Its capacity to produce up to 26.5 pounds of ice per day (yes, you read that right) really came through during a barbecue party. No more awkward moments running out of ice mid-party! The ice cubes themselves? Smooth, consistent in size, and melted slower than store-bought offerings in my drinks.

[Check Zlinke Geshini Ice Maker price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0d3xfgqb5/)

**User-Friendly Controls and Features**  
Operating this device didn‚Äôt require me to be a tech wizard, thankfully. The LED control panel made ice-making entirely idiot-proof. Everything from selecting the desired cube size to keeping tabs on the basket‚Äôs fullness was clear and straightforward. Even my six-year-old nephew figured out how to help grab ice cubes for his juice‚Äîunder my supervision, of course! Moreover, that self-cleaning function was terrific; a simple press of a button saved me the hassle of manual cleaning after heavy usage.

**Pluses**  
- Sleek design that fits well into small spaces.  
- Quick ice production, making nine cubes in under eight minutes.  
- Super intuitive control panel with handy LED indicators.  
- Safety-first design‚Äîauto shut-off when the basket is full or when water runs low.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Despite the rapid production, the ice basket‚Äôs capacity is somewhat limited. For larger gatherings, I had to proactively empty it into a cooler.  
- It‚Äôs noisier than I anticipated when operating. Don‚Äôt expect library silence when it‚Äôs running.  
- The machine operates best when filled with filtered water, which meant extra effort on my part to refill it.  

**Energy Efficiency and Maintenance**  
As someone equally concerned about the environment and electricity consumption, I paid close attention to how this ice maker affected my energy bill. With its 115 volts, it's not outrageously draining on power, but it‚Äôs not the most low-energy appliance either. The cleaning process, however, simplified my life. The self-cleaning feature saved a lot of elbow grease, but every couple of weeks, I gave it an additional wipe-down to keep the luster intact and rid it of mineral buildup. 

**Competitive Options**  
Stacked against similar countertop ice makers, like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker, this device holds its own in more budget-friendly settings. Admittedly, the Opal makes fancier ice (nuggets!) and has an app for easier controls, but it comes at about three times the cost. On the flip side, cheaper models, such as those from Euhomy, often lack reliability or compromise on build quality. While the Zlinke model isn‚Äôt entirely silent, it avoids the obnoxious, grinding sounds notoriously associated with off-brand ice makers.

**Financial Value**  
Without disclosing exact numbers, the price-point here felt aligned with the level of performance and sleek appearance the product offers. Considering how much faster it churns ice compared to similar models, and with bonuses like self-cleaning and automatic shut-off, the cost seemed justified. For those frequently entertaining guests or sipping iced drinks, this countertop option proves its worth. However, if you‚Äôre someone who demands niche features like Bluetooth or nugget ice, a pricier model might be worth exploring.

*This account of an unforgettable Paschal celebration with¬†Holy Hieromartyr Hilarion (Troitsky)¬†in the Solovki prison camp was published in shortened form from I. A. Reznikov,*¬†Orthodoxy on Solovki¬†*(St. Petersburg, 1993).*¬†

https://preview.redd.it/7a2kuaiulzze1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=9150618a2a2035d2b018038e52b3c64c70542e6a

This was probably the hardest Pascha of the four I had to spend as a prisoner for the sake of the great Russian Church, from 1923 to June, 1926. The first was in Butyrsky prison, two were on the¬†Solovki Islands, and one was on Popov Island, at what I would call a punitive transfer point. This last Pascha left an indelible mark in me‚Äîone the one hand, it left an external, sorrowful mark, but on the other, a joyful one. It‚Äôs an inner joy I especially poignantly feel now that I live on a different edge of the world‚Äîhaving moved from the far north to the far south. My sorrow began on that Pascha because it was all unexpected. I was supposed to be spending that fourth Pascha at home, in the circle of my family. But the Lord judged otherwise.

On March 30, the sentence for our entire group ended‚Äîa sentence we had served for the honor of our Mother Church, for the honor of the St. Nicholas parish, which had refused to recognize the authority of the Rostov Revolutionary Committee on Church Affairs over its existence. And on March 31 at 11:30 p.m., Fr. Alexei‚Äôs \[Trifiliev‚Äôs\] friend V. D. Anfilov, the clerk of the camp administration, summoned him from the invalid unit and congratulated him on his release. Having read the telegram, Fr. Alexei was perplexed to see that my surname was not listed there. Meanwhile, I was sleeping in my clerical unit, when the chancellor Pivovarov walked in and informed us that three of us were being congratulated with an answered request. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúif it‚Äôs three, then I am one of them. How could it be otherwise?‚Äù and peacefully fell back asleep, rejoicing that tomorrow I would say, ‚ÄúSo long, transfer point‚ÄîPopov Island‚Äù‚Äîtruly a punitive island. But the morning brought the saddest possible news: I and Bishop Mitrophan, for an unknown reason, were staying there for an unknown amount of time. Maybe a week, maybe ten weeks. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúI again get more than others! Either I‚Äôm the most sinful, or the Lord loves me the most!..‚Äù

My envious eyes followed Fr. Alexei and six other priests, and I remained to languish in expectation of the day that Anfilov would call for me too.

[Priest Pavel Chekhranov](https://preview.redd.it/my95zpoxlzze1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b2e6d815b65996199801bf29e19eb7afc05d0f3)

All around was ice, snow, barbed wire, and booths on high towers where the guards in sheepskin coats cursed the island as they watched out for the lives of desperate ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù: bishops, priests, and archdeacons‚Ä¶ My heart was filled with sorrow. But in my mind, the thought nevertheless occurred: ‚ÄúIs there anything accidental in your life? Doesn‚Äôt the Lord direct the world and your life? Could He wish you evil? Just wait a bit, and you‚Äôll see the good consequences of this temporary delay.‚Äù

Two weeks passed. There was another unlucky prisoner, the military engineer E. I. Przevalsky. His sentence had finished back on February 23; now it was already April 15, and he was still not being released. Fully convinced that he would leave the camp at the end of his sentence, E. I. had written to the administration of a factory in the Urals and received a position with a salary of 200 rubles. One could understand his anxiety and longing‚Äîafter all, a good position was slipping away. Moreover, the travel money they had sent him was spent, but he couldn‚Äôt leave. And so, we two unfortunates, sitting or pacing around the barrack, made various suppositions about the reason for our delays, or checked to see if a boat had arrived with mail.

My languishing was disrupted by the work supervisor‚Äîa Georgian officer who was also a prisoner‚ÄîYashvili.

[Holy Hieromartyr Hilarion \(Troitsky\)](https://preview.redd.it/91kd55dzlzze1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=f177e75047fb0887a1d3c941029f975228baf8ca)

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he said to me, ‚Äúthey‚Äôve brought Hilarion here today with a party of prisoners!..‚Äù

‚ÄúNo kidding?!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, yes, they‚Äôre checking him in the invalid unit‚Ä¶‚Äù

Although it was about 10:00 p.m., I decided to go and see the dear archpastor. But they weren‚Äôt letting anyone in until the check was over. Not giving it much thought, I took a bundle of papers in hand‚Äîempty inventory blanks‚Äîgrabbed a pencil, and with the air of an officer assigned a special task, I went straight there. The military command sent from Petrograd turned out to be rather decent and polite, and they let me in freely. For this kindness I informed them:

‚ÄúBe careful, there‚Äôs typhus in the camp‚Ä¶‚Äù

In the barracks, there was shouting, noise, and commotion‚Äîthe search was in full swing. I peeked in and saw Archbishop Hilarion sitting on the bunk in a brown kaftan. As soon as he saw me, he jumped up:

‚ÄúFr. Pavel!.. Fr. Pavel!..‚Äù

We kissed each other. But our friendly encounter was noticed by the unit commanders and assistant to the camp supervisors, Pepellevsky (General Pepellevsky) and F. Polivtsev. And although I proved my status with papers and pencils, they nevertheless insisted I get out until the end of the search.

The next day, Vladyka Hilarion considered it his obligation to share all the information he had on Church life that he had ‚Äúreceived‚Äù in Yaroslavl, in the political isolation ward. He gave a very detailed report about being visited by the head of the ‚ÄúSecret Department‚Äù‚ÄîTuchkov‚Äîrelayed the exact conversation he had with him, and presented a written declaration concerning the principles of our Orthodox Holy Church. ‚ÄúIf you desire to have peace among the people, then give us freedom today, and it will all calm down... Three divisive councils are enough for us‚Äîthe one in the year 445, and the two in Moscow‚Äîin 1923 and 1924,‚Äù Vladyka Hilarion ended his declaration. What an amazingly kind man! He considered it his responsibility to share with his old acquaintances his impressions and information about his time in the isolation ward. These heart-to-heart daily conversations with Vladyka Hilarion greatly comforted our highly disagreeable existence in the Kem unit‚Äîespecially mine, imprisoned as I was for two months past the end of my sentence.¬†¬†¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/5leyyeg1mzze1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7a8b28d91433b8efccafcd7565a3acda2605940

Soon it would be Pascha. People seen and unseen were being dragged to the unit. As a result of the spring floods, the forest work had ended, and over a thousand men had returned to the camp. But the entire camp was built for only 800 people. The club was closed and turned into living quarters with bunks. In the other barracks, the corridors were stuffed with bunks, and two-level bunks were turned into three-level bunks. Even the privileged clerical barrack was given double bunks, and instead of sixty men there were now 120. Boiling water was not being distributed freely, because the kettles were occupied with lunch and dinner.

It was Pascha. And how we longed to celebrate it with prayers, even if under difficult circumstances. ‚ÄúHow can it be?‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúEven now, when it‚Äôs hard to even push your way through the crowd to talk with someone, how can we keep from singing, ‚ÄúChrist is Risen! On this Paschal night?‚Äù So I decided to prepare my brotherhood. I talked with the most magnanimous Bishop Nektary (Trezvinsky), Bishop Mitrophan (Grishin), Bishop Raphael (Gumilev), and Bishop Gabriel (Abalnikov). The latter did not even suspect what an Easter egg was being prepared for him. Of the rest of the brothers were Fr. Philofei, a chess player, and the Vladyka Hilarion‚Äôs constant companion, Fr. Arkady Marakulin.¬†¬†¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/l2ny8fp2mzze1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=e327a609be9ca380b48b85265c459076ad0fc867

The invitees divided into two groups. Only Archbishop Hilarion and Bishop Nektary agreed to hold a Paschal service in a far-from-completed bakery, where only a few openings had been cut‚Äîno doors, no windows. The rest of the bishops decided to hold the service in their barrack, on the third bunk, right under the ceiling, next to the company commander‚Äôs quarters. But I resolved to chant the Paschal service outside the barrack, so that, at least during those moments, I would not have to hear the profanity.

We all agreed.

It was Holy Saturday. The prisoners‚Äô yard and barracks were packed like sardines with men returning from forest work. But now we were met with a new trial. An order was issued by the camp commandant to the company officers not to allow even the slightest hint of a church service, and from 8 p.m. onward, no one was to be allowed out from other companies. Bishops Mitrophan and Gabriel informed me of this order with sorrow. Nevertheless, I insisted to my ‚Äúclergy‚Äù that we should still attempt to hold the service in the bakery. Bishop Nektary agreed immediately, while Archbishop Hilarion hesitated‚Äîbut still asked to be awakened at midnight.

At the beginning of the twelfth hour, I first went to the barrack where Bishop Nektary was staying. The doors were wide open, and as I entered quickly, the duty guard blocked my way.

‚ÄúNo one from other companies is allowed in‚Ä¶‚Äù

I stopped in hesitation. However, Bishop Nektary was ready.

‚ÄúJust a moment, just a moment,‚Äù he said to me. Then I went to see Bishop Hilarion. Entering the barrack swiftly, I walked past the duty guard, who happened to be somewhat familiar with me and friendly.

‚ÄúGo ahead, do it quickly and leave. It‚Äôs not allowed‚Ä¶‚Äù

I nodded to him, then walked up to Vladyka Hilarion, who was stretched out to his full gigantic length, sleeping. I nudged his boot; the bishop stirred and sat up.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù I whispered.

The entire barrack was asleep. I stepped outside. Bishop Nektary was waiting at the lineup area. Bishop Hilarion joined us, and the three of us quietly walked in single file toward the back of the barracks, where across the road stood the skeleton of an unfinished bakery, with openings for windows and doors. We had agreed to slip in one at a time, rather than all at once. Once inside the building, we chose a wall that offered the most cover from the view of anyone passing along the path. We pressed ourselves tightly against it‚ÄîBishop Nektary on the left, Bishop Hilarion in the middle, and I on the right.

‚ÄúBegin,‚Äù said Bishop Nektary quietly.

‚ÄúMatins?‚Äù asked Vladyka Hilarion.

‚ÄúNo, everything in order, from Midnight Office,‚Äù replied Bishop Nektary.

‚ÄúBlessed is our God‚Ä¶‚Äù Bishop Hilarion softly pronounced.

We began to chant the Midnight Office.

‚ÄúThou Who of old buried the pursuing tyrant beneath the waves of the sea‚Ä¶‚Äù we sang.

And those words, with their stirring melody, echoed strangely and deeply in our hearts.

‚ÄúAnd now the children of those Thou didst save bury Thee beneath the earth‚Ä¶‚Äù

And the whole tragedy of the pursuing Pharoah, especially in these circumstances, was felt in our hearts more acutely than ever before‚Äîthe White Sea with its white, icy covering, the floor beams on which we stood as on a choir loft, the fear of being discovered by the watch. But despite all this our hearts were breathing joy, because we were celebrating the Paschal service against the strict orders of the commandant.

We finished the Midnight Office. Archbishop Hilarion blessed to begin Matins.

Vladyka Hilarion did not pronounce ‚ÄúLet God arise, and let His enemies be scattered‚Äù but rather whispered it as he peered into the darkness of night.

We sang, ‚ÄúChrist is Risen!..‚Äù

‚ÄúShall I weep, or laugh for joy?‚Äù I thought to myself. How I wanted to fully voice those wondrous irmoi! But caution guided us. The Matins ended.

‚ÄúChrist is Risen!‚Äù said Vladyka Hilarion and we all exchanged the Paschal kiss.

Vladyka Hilarion pronounced the dismissal and left for the barrack. Bishop Nektary wished to serve the hours and typica. We served them together. Only, I was the head celebrant, while Vladyka Nektary was the cantor. That is how he wanted it, for he knew all the hymns, the readings, and the Epistles by heart.

During the day, in honor of the feast, I invited Vladyka Hilarion for coffee in my barrack. However, we ended up drinking it in the office of the supply department, which was empty due to the holiday. Vladyka was surprised by my boldness and resourcefulness. The coffee was served with halva and pieces of kulich (Easter bread), which had been sent by the Kem clergy for all of us.¬†¬†¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/l7ty6pq4mzze1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa876c98caedd6037681012a61f6f4a963e67f8

‚ÄúHave you ever had Viennese-style coffee?‚Äù Vladyka asked me, and, laughing, explained how it is made.

The next day, Vladyka Nektary and I did the services together as we walked along the path. And this day also seemed so festal to me, just like the first, with ‚Äúdivine services.‚Äù

That Paschal service remained in Vladyka Hilarion‚Äôs memory as well. That year, in December, his term was supposed to end. He had already been transferred from¬†Solovki¬†to the mainland due to the end of the navigation season. In December, I received a letter from him: ‚ÄúThe wheel of fortune has turned back‚ÄîI am being sent to Solovki again...‚Äù Indeed, a notice had arrived from Moscow to extend his isolation by another three years. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been enrolled in the repeat course,‚Äù joked Vladyka Hilarion. And in May of 1927, he wrote to me, ‚ÄúI remember last year‚Äôs Pascha‚Äîhow different it is from today! How solemnly we celebrated it back then!..‚Äù

Yes, the setting of Pascha in 1926 was extraordinary.

Or you're already established and repped with a niche art style, and this would take too much time away from your craft in a studio.

But for those of you that are emerging, posting online endlessly and getting nowhere, and are open to this idea, it's pretty much guaranteed for even the most mediocre of artists to earn some income. Not guaranteeing a whole lot, but at least more than you are now.

It's simply this, Create In Public. Paint, draw, sculpt, whatever.

I guarantee that even if you're not trying to earn an income, if you create work in public, at least 1 out of 12 times, you will catch someones attention who will likely want to either buy your work on the spot or become a patron in the future.

This is different than if you are setting up as a caricature artist with a table where it is obvious that's how you earn. You'd probably cut the 1/12 down to the first day depending on your skill and location.

So if all you did was sit in a bar with a sketch pad, draw sitting on a sidewalk bench, sketch in a coffee shop, paint in the park, and you did that at least 12 times (where there are people), there is someone who would want to hire you.

As much marketing as people do online, it's mostly good to keep connected but the majority portion of work I've ever earned from from was by sales or connections I've made in person while plein airing or drawing in public.",4,1746897172.0,artbusiness,1,0.83,False
1kjf6qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kjf6qh/should_you_buy_cmf_buds_pro_2_wireless_earbuds/,Should You Buy CMF Buds Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds Review Amazing Noise Cancelling Tech?,"Testing out the CMF BY NOTHING CMF Buds Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds has been a ride through audio excellence, with a sprinkling of quirks to keep things real. These dark grey in-ear marvels managed to surprise me in ways I didn‚Äôt expect. From casual workdays to sweat-drenched workouts, I've pushed these buds through every scenario I could think of, and they genuinely held their own.

**Sophisticated and Compact Design**  
The first time I held them, the lightweight build of the earbuds struck me. Weighing just 46 grams for the carrying case and 3.53 ounces overall, the earbuds offer a sleek design that fits snugly into my ears. No awkward adjustments or threatening-to-pop-out dramas here. The included ear tips in small, medium, and large sizes ensured I found my perfect fit, even on my oddly-shaped ears. The dark grey tone gives a subtle yet modern vibe‚Äînot overly flashy, just stylish enough to leave an impression. The case feels sturdy without being bulky, and its compact size of 1.97 x 0.79 x 1.97 inches slides right into my pocket with ease.  

The material, mostly plastic, didn‚Äôt feel cheap but rather enduring for day-to-day use. However, I did have a slight gripe with how easily the case seemed to collect fingerprints over time. A quick wipe-down always fixed things, but it made me subtly wish for a matte finish instead of shiny plastic.

**Immersive Sound Quality**  
Listening to music on these earbuds felt like sitting in a personal recording studio. The LDAC-certified Hi-Res Audio feature truly delivered, with crispness and clarity that made every lyric and instrument pop. I even caught subtle nuances in songs I‚Äôve listened to for years! The earbuds support transmission rates up to 990 kbps, and trust me, the jump in sound accuracy compared to typical wireless methods is leaps and bounds.

The Ultra Bass Technology 2.0 really shines if you‚Äôre a bass fanatic like myself. It dynamically enhances low frequencies in real time without drowning out the mids or highs. Using the Nothing X app, I played around with the five adjustable bass levels to cater to different genres‚Äîfrom thundering EDM beats during workouts to soft acoustics while winding down.

**Positives**  
- Excellent noise cancellation that ensures focus, even in noisy environments.  
- Deep, rich bass adjustable through the accompanying app.  
- Lightweight and comfortable design suitable for long wearing sessions.  
- Extended playback time‚Äî43 hours combined with the case, and 10 hours per bud on a single charge.  

[Check CMF BY NOTHING CMF Buds Pro 2 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0d83j6jj9/)

**Effective Noise Cancellation**  
Advanced Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling was hands down one of my favorite features. While traveling on a buzzing subway or working in coffee shops, the ANC tech could tune out up to 50 dB of ambient noise. Pairing this with the unique Adaptive ANC mode via the app was icing on the cake; it auto-calibrated to cancel out the noise leakage from my ear canal. Whether I needed focus or just some peaceful alone time, these earbuds delivered quietude on demand.

Would I call it flawless? Not quite. The noise cancellation occasionally struggled with extremely high-pitched sounds (like plates clinking or toddlers‚Äô screeches), but otherwise, it‚Äôs a formidable feature.

**Reliable Battery Life**  
Battery life on these buds exceeded my expectations. A single bud offered roughly 10 hours of uninterrupted playback, which, combined with the 43-hour capacity of the case, meant I could go days without scrambling for a charger. Quick charging was handy during rushed mornings, getting the earbuds juiced up in no time.  

One nitpick, though: the charging case uses a USB-A to Type-C cable, which felt a little outdated in a world leaning heavily into Type-C-only connectivity. It‚Äôs a minor inconvenience if you don‚Äôt keep a USB-A option handy at all times.

**Negatives**  
- Prone to collecting visible smudges and fingerprints on the glossy case.  
- Struggles slightly with canceling sharp, high-pitched noises.  
- Slightly outdated charging cable (USB-A to Type-C).  

**Other Options**  
Compared to peers like the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds or Apple‚Äôs AirPods Pro, the CMF Buds Pro 2 give you a considerable bang for your buck. While both competitors may edge out slightly in seamless noise-canceling performance, the CMF Buds Pro 2 match up in audio depth and destroy that ‚ÄúApple tax‚Äù price tag. They certainly fill a sweet spot for users who want premium sound features without digging too deep into their wallets.

I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre all in on Apple‚Äôs ecosystem, the AirPods Pro may offer a tighter integration experience (hello, hands-free Siri). Sony‚Äôs WF-1000XM4s, on the other hand, may be the audiophile‚Äôs choice due to their even more advanced ANC system and flexibility across platforms. Still, the CMF Buds Pro 2 don‚Äôt feel like a compromise‚Äîthey hold their ground at a much more palatable cost.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For their price point, these wireless earbuds nail most of the key elements people want‚Äîsuperior audio, top-notch noise cancellation, and long-lasting battery life. You could easily spend hundreds more chasing these features in another brand, but CMF Buds Pro 2 deliver a nearly identical experience for considerably less.  

Sure, some bells and whistles like dual-device connectivity or ultra-modern features are missing, but they‚Äôve refined the essentials where it truly counts.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

After that I did quit caffeine and took medication such bisoprolol 2.5 mg, candesartan 8mg, and statins. All as protective medication and not to treat any chronic diseases.

Echo showed: mildly dilated Left Atrium, diastolic dysfunction grade 1, thickening of the walls of your left ventricle. All due to lack of exercise, stress, ‚Ä¶etc.

Last month, I had my second episode after couple of months of eating too much, sugary drinks and food, little exercise. BMI around 33. I was returned to sinus rhythm by chemical cardio version after 17 or 18 hours. 

My doctor said that my episode is Vagal in nature. We agreed to change life style dramatically: lose weight, exercise regularly and eat healthy food. 

My questions are:
1- Has anyone had a similar case and improved after losing weight and changing lifestyle?

2- Has anyone lived with Afib since they were in their thirties and had a close to normal life till 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs?

3- When should I go for ablation?

4- I take Eliquis for a month after an episode, can I live normal life with Anticoagulant? Can I drive, travel, exercise, ‚Ä¶.etc?

4- Please share any advice that could help.

Emotions are not a reaction to a circumstance. Yet most people are enslaved by their emotions based on lack of awarness.

For example, lets say you sit in a cafe and the waiter spills coffe on your new jacket. You scream and shout at him. One might think that the emotion of anger arises from the fact that he spilled the coffee. But it doesn't. It arises from your perspective on reality and intention. You shout not because he spilled the coffee, but because you give meaning and value to your new jacket and are materialistic. Your intention is to be an authority over someone who you think did you wrong.

So, first comes the goals, intentions and perspective on reality you have, then the impulse, that then triggers the emotion based on your intention and inner framework. You are angry because you, often subconsciously, CHOOSE to be angry.

If you subconsciously think ""nothing here matters or stimulates me"" , your brain may generate the feeling of boredom as a kind of alignment with that internal state! That means if you actively shift your intention to ""life is a fascinating experience that holds opportunity everywhere i look, especially if i look inward"", your whole reality and emotions shift.

My ideal machine right is the Profitec Go (could be convinced on something like the bambino). I have always wanted an espresso machine and I‚Äôm very willing and excited to learn how to use it. 

My wife not so much. She is on board with getting rid of the Nespresso (for reasons above), but wants a Breville Barista Touch as she thinks it would be easier for her to use than the Profitec go (due to built in grinder, auto milk steaming, touch screen?, etc).

Regardless of what machine I buy, I will likely buy a dedicated single dose grinder (looking at the DF54). I haven‚Äôt heard many good things about the Touch built-in grinder, and I want better control over my grind. In my mind I would brew espresso in a more manual fashion even with the Touch, and my wife could use it with a more ‚Äúautomated‚Äù approach.

Budget is flexible, but probably want to stay under $2000 total. I am not in favor of a super automatic.

Is it ridiculous to buy a Touch and separate grinder, or could she reasonably learn to use a Profitec Go or similar machine with separate grinder once I get everything more dialed in? Alternatively, I just brew all her drinks for her.

There was one time me and my friends had a sleep over and I cannot sleep during the middle of the night, so I drank water to recover my body fluid, cannot sleep after so I tried to read some books but when I was in the library, at the farthest table, someone opened the door. I looked at who opened it but there was none, I expect that my neighbor would just enter and speak to me what I'm doing here in the middle of the night but there was none.  So I slowly arranged the books and left running to the bedroom after I realized something was cold when was arranging the books. 

Like a gust of wind but there was no open windows, so cold that I got a goosebumps, but due to my instincts I keep calm like nothing was there but when I closed the door, I sprint to my room and forgot to locked it.

Anyway I tried not to tell this to my neighbors who would just tease me again, telling me I'm wicked but yeah, everything was real for me.

Few years had passed and my neighbors had a cousin who lives with them now, she was now in highschool so yeah, I made friends with her and she loves books like me but when she remembers that there was a library in the house, I got a chill so I just let her so maybe she can feel that something was there,  she didn't feel anything so maybe I was just imagining things, well sure I just felt it once and I been there multiple times so maybe I'm just imagining things.

I came with her everytime she had a chance to read books in the library, I enjoy spending time with her at that place and I don't feel anything weird again so yeah, so on and so on.

Until one day, I just casually said to my neighbor while they invites me for a coffee, they tease me about my relationship with her so I just giggles and accidentally said that I felt scary things in that library so I stop for a while at that time. I noticed they froze so I asked them why, they just told me this.

Emotions are not a reaction to a circumstance. Yet most people are enslaved by their emotions based on lack of awarness.

For example, lets say you sit in a cafe and the waiter spills coffe on your new jacket. You scream and shout at him. One might think that the emotion of anger arises from the fact that he spilled the coffee. But it doesn't. It arises from your perspective on reality and intention. You shout not because he spilled the coffee, but because you give meaning and value to your new jacket and are materialistic. Your intention is to be an authority over someone who you think did you wrong.

So, first comes the goals, intentions and perspective on reality you have, then the impulse, that then triggers the emotion based on your intention and inner framework. You are angry because you, often subconsciously, CHOOSE to be angry.

If you subconsciously think ""nothing here matters or stimulates me"" , your brain may generate the feeling of boredom as a kind of alignment with that internal state! That means if you actively shift your intention to ""life is a fascinating experience that holds opportunity everywhere i look, especially if i look inward"", your whole reality and emotions shift. And with that change in perspective, boredom can be eliminated permanently. Change your inner framework and be in charge of your emotions.",4,1746896122.0,selfimprovement,2,1.0,False

While I've decided to take a small break from my main horror project, today I felt like sharing some progress on another project I'm not actively working on right now. üòÑ

So, before I got seriously into developing *Nightmare Within*, I was assembling mechanics ‚Äî like a construction set ‚Äî for something resembling an RPG in a stylized setting. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm making my own *Zelda* ‚Äî honestly, I‚Äôve never even played it. But the first thing my little creation reminds people of *is* Zelda. Let‚Äôs put it this way: I‚Äôm familiar with its core mechanics and visual style. üòä

Basically, it all started with me just building out different mechanics, one after another ‚Äî without any real intention of ever releasing the project. I simply enjoy doing this, and it's a great way to improve my skills with the game engine. Of course, I understand that projects like this are usually made by teams of at least 10+ people. When you're working solo, expecting any kind of serious success is probably naive. So, without high hopes, I‚Äôve just been doing what I love.

Anyway, this alpha-beta-demo-mockup already includes the following working mechanics: combat, archery, magic, a functional inventory and crafting system, dialogues and trading. There are also several movement mechanics implemented: walking, gliding with a paraglider, sprinting, climbing with ledge-grabbing, as well as swimming ‚Äî both on the surface and underwater. These are the main mechanics currently in place.

In addition to that, there are some smaller but fun features: a photo mode, various types of arrows ‚Äî from regular ones to explosive or freezing ones that affect enemies, different kinds of swords with unique effects and animations. There‚Äôs also an experience and leveling system based on defeating enemies. Of course, there‚Äôs potential to expand this later ‚Äî by adding skill upgrades, new attacks, and so on.

I don‚Äôt yet have a clear concept or written story for the project. It‚Äôs more like a cartoonish open-world game where you can pick up quests and complete them as you explore. No microtransactions, no junk, no multiplayer ‚Äî just something nice and simple. üòä

Below I‚Äôm attaching a few screenshots taken during gameplay. For now, I‚Äôll stick with images, but later ‚Äî if anyone‚Äôs interested ‚Äî I might record some gameplay footage. I‚Äôd love to hear feedback from those who find this interesting. Maybe, after I release my main project, it‚Äôll make sense to return to this cartoonish RPG and turn it into at least a demo version.

The first edition of the Summer Vibes Festival will take place on Saturday June 21st, 2025, with camping available from 6/20-6/21. Come ride, run, party and camp with us to kick off summer over the solstice weekend!

Mixed terrain 5-Mile Run
Traction Coffee Grip & Rip Dirt Jump Jam (Pro and Amateur categories)

The city outside was soaked in rain, the kind that made everything blur. Elliot walked the streets that evening with no umbrella, no direction. Just his coat and the heaviness inside him. That was pushing him a step at a time to an unknown destination.
He finally stopped at a diner, the kind that was always half empty and smelled like old coffee and fried eggs and potatoes. He didn‚Äôt want food nor company . He just wanted to sclude himself and sit somewhere where no one knew his name or story.
An older man sat at the counter beside him. Worn grey coat, thick tired hands, soft hazel eyes. He had ordered a black coffee with too much sugar.
He sat there for few minutes saying nothing.
Elliot didn‚Äôt speak, he was too tired to do so. You could read it all over his face, but the man did.

‚ÄúBad night?‚Äù

Elliot nodded.

‚ÄúLost?‚Äù

Another nod.

The man took a sip of his coffee. 
‚ÄúYou know, twenty years ago, I stood on a bridge at 2 in the midnight. I thought I was done and my life no longer had a purpose and i no longer a place in this world‚Äù
Elliot looked up troubled by the idea that the old man read him so easily. As if he had a sign on his chest saying (about to suicide) but he didn‚Äôt mind it anymore. He thought that nothing can change his mind and stop him from doing it.
‚ÄúSat there for hours, time just flew by and it was morning already.‚Äù the man went on, like he was just remembering it himself. ‚ÄúAnd then this kid who was maybe twelve or a bit older rode by on his bike and said, ‚ÄòYou look sad, mister. Want half my sandwich?‚Äô‚Äù
The man laughed softly. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take the sandwich. But I laughed. I laughed so hard i scared the poor little boy away. I laughed for the First time in months. And suddenly, I thought maybe I could keep going one more day.‚Äù
Elliot didn‚Äôt say anything.
The man looked at him with a very warm expression. ‚ÄúSometimes, it‚Äôs not the people who know you and your story who save you. It‚Äôs the ones who step into your world and remind you that you still matter and there is hope left.‚Äù
The diner light flickered in the dark room.
Elliot had no time to stop the tears that had surprised him.

1kjegv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kjegv2/does_the_unbreakable_y1418_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Does the Unbreakable Y1-418 Pour Over Coffee Maker Deliver? Review Inside!,"The Unbreakable Y1-418 Pour Over Coffee Maker caught my eye mainly because of its distinctive name and its promise of delivering a premium home coffee experience. I‚Äôve been using it daily for the past few weeks, and as someone serious about coffee but not quite a barista, I had some high hopes and a few reservations. Let's dive into my personal experience using this coffee maker and see if it lives up to the hype.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, this pour-over coffee maker feels sleek and modern. With its thickened, heat-resistant borosilicate glass and ergonomic handle, it‚Äôs easy on the eyes and even easier to use. The anti-drip spout is a small but significant detail that I‚Äôve come to appreciate while pouring, as it ensures no coffee goes rogue onto my counter. The ""Unbreakable"" branding felt a tad ironic, seeing as it‚Äôs glass and does require gentle care, but the glass does feel sturdier compared to other coffee makers I‚Äôve used before. While the design is undeniably attractive, it would benefit from a sturdier base for higher stability.

**Brewing Experience**

Brewing coffee with this device is an art. The manual aspect of the Y1-418 makes it a hands-on experience, which truly lets you appreciate the craft of coffee making. I followed the simple instruction of adding coarsely ground coffee to its reusable stainless steel filter and poured hot water evenly across the grounds. It‚Äôs clear that the design allows for optimal water saturation, resulting in a rich and aromatic cup of coffee in just minutes. That said, this isn‚Äôt for someone looking for a completely hands-off brewing experience. The manual pour-over process can be a bit time-consuming if you're in a rush, but it‚Äôs worth it for the flavor you get.

**Key Benefits**

- Made from heat-resistant, thick borosilicate glass, which is safe for the stovetop and refrigerator.  
- The reusable double stainless steel filter eliminates the need for disposable paper filters, making it eco-friendly.  
- Ergonomic handle and anti-drip spout allow for easy and clean pouring without mishaps.  
- The coffee it produces is exceptional‚Äîaromatic, rich, and smooth, embodying the essence of pour-over brewing.

**Drawbacks**

While I‚Äôve enjoyed my time with this coffee maker, it‚Äôs not completely without fault. For instance, the stainless steel filter, though reusable, occasionally lets fine coffee grounds through unless I‚Äôm extra careful with the grind size. In addition, the borosilicate glass requires careful handling if you want it to last, but that‚Äôs par for the course with any glass coffee maker. Lastly, its 34-ounce capacity is sufficient, but not ideal if you're serving a large group of coffee enthusiasts.  

- Fine grounds can sneak through the reusable filter, impacting texture.  
- The glass construction, while beautiful, needs gentle handling.  
- Not suited for large gatherings due to its limited capacity.  

**Positives of the Coffee Flavor**

Coffee aficionados will appreciate how well this manual pour-over coffee maker extracts flavors. Since you control the water flow, you can adjust how strong or delicate you‚Äôd like your brew. I even used it for iced coffee and lightly frothy cappuccinos, and both came out pretty close to caf√© quality. It allows you to enjoy the authentic taste of coffee with minimal bitterness‚Äîsomething automated coffee machines can sometimes struggle with.

**Competing Products**

When comparing this coffee maker to others, two alternatives come to mind: the Hario V60 and the Chemex Classic Series. The Hario V60 is a classic for anyone serious about pour-over brewing, offering excellent flavor precision but doesn‚Äôt come with a reusable filter. The Chemex, on the other hand, shines with its beautiful glass design but relies on disposable filter papers, which is less eco-friendly. What makes the Y1-418 stand out is its built-in reusable filter and the added versatility of being stovetop and refrigerator safe. However, unlike the Chemex, it lacks a slightly sturdier aesthetic appeal‚ÄîChemex feels a bit more premium in hand.

**Cost Efficiency**

For those looking for affordable quality, this pour-over coffee maker delivers a lot for its price range. It sits comfortably between budget coffee makers and premium high-end pour-over devices, offering the best of both worlds. It‚Äôs sturdy, functional, and aesthetically pleasing without breaking the bank. If you're weighing the cost-to-value ratio, it‚Äôs safe to say this device earns its place on the countertop with its eco-friendly reusable filter and ability to brew quality coffee consistently.

1kjeguw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1kjeguw/why_choose_thorne_advanced_bone_support_for/,Why Choose THORNE Advanced Bone Support for Stronger Bones A Detailed Review,"Maintaining healthy and strong bones has always been a priority for me, especially given the sedentary lifestyle that comes with working long hours at a desk. I‚Äôve recently been testing the **THORNE Advanced Bone Support B0012ZW8TI** supplement‚Äîformerly known as Oscap‚Äîand it has been an interesting addition to my daily routine. While I appreciate its formulation, there are both highlights and areas for consideration, which I will explore in this review, all based on my personal experience using this product extensively.

**Unassuming Design, Big Promise**  
Despite its minimalist packaging, this 120-capsule supplement packs a punch for overall bone health. The small bottle fits easily into my pantry shelf, taking up very little space. The capsules themselves are of standard size, and even for someone who isn‚Äôt very comfortable swallowing pills, I didn‚Äôt find them particularly challenging. One noticeable feature is that they‚Äôre unflavored, which I appreciate‚Äîno strange aftertastes hanging around after taking them.

[Find the best price for THORNE B0012ZW8TI on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0012zw8ti/)

**A Formula That Goes Beyond the Basics**  
This isn‚Äôt just a calcium supplement‚Äîit goes well beyond. Each dose combines the essentials like calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D while also including some lesser-known but incredibly important minerals like vitamin K2. I‚Äôve read about the effectiveness of K2 in directing calcium into bones rather than letting it sit in arteries, and having this included does make a difference. This product feels like it‚Äôs been intelligently crafted, and I appreciate that it doesn‚Äôt lean on calcium alone for its effectiveness.

**Key Benefits**  
- Combines calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin K for comprehensive bone support.  
- Suitable for postmenopausal women or those looking for additional daily bone-health reinforcement.  
- Gluten-free and devoid of common allergens like soy, dairy, or nuts.  

**The Routine Factor**  
The simplicity of the dosage‚Äîtwo capsules daily‚Äîmakes for an effortless integration into my schedule. I‚Äôve found it easy to pair with my breakfast or after my morning coffee. Over the past few weeks, I haven‚Äôt missed a single dose because it‚Äôs been stress-free to keep up with. However, I wonder why the capsules aren‚Äôt separated into morning and evening doses since bone nutrient absorption could benefit from such spacing.

**Who Can Benefit Most?**  
This supplement appears to be specifically formulated for adults, with an emphasis on women post-menopause or anyone needing added support for their bones. I‚Äôve approached it as a general preventive measure, but I can imagine that individuals recovering from fractures or experiencing significant bone density loss might see even more pronounced benefits.

**Pluses**  
- Compact size, travel-friendly packaging.  
- No taste or lingering artificial flavor in capsules.  
- Trusted by healthcare professionals and institutions like the Mayo Clinic.  

**Caveats**  
- Capsules might not suit vegans as they contain gelatin.  
- Not cost-friendly if consumed long-term compared to some generic calcium supplements.  
- Feelings of mild nausea when taken on an empty stomach.  

**Competing Brands to Consider**  
Many calcium supplements populate the market, but few combine this level of thoughtful design. Compared to brands like Garden of Life or NOW Foods, THORNE Advanced Bone Support feels more comprehensive due to added vitamin K2 and magnesium in higher potencies. That said, alternatives like AlgaeCal may appeal more to those leaning towards plant-based ingredients. Where AlgaeCal excels in natural sourcing, THORNE might win with lower allergen risks and no unnecessary additives. There‚Äôs also Citracal Plus with its slow-release design, which might work better for those sensitive to higher doses taken at once.

**Cost Effectiveness**  
From a value perspective, it sits at a mid-to-premium range for bone supplements. While not the cheapest option, it delivers a formulation that sets it apart from standard competitors. For someone looking at bone supplements as an investment in health rather than just an expense, it‚Äôs worth the price‚Äîespecially considering the added peace of mind that it‚Äôs science-backed and hypoallergenic.

1kjef6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustyconsumer/comments/1kjef6s/why_should_you_trust_the_surelife_wrs35h_wrist/,Why Should You Trust the SureLife WRS-35H Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor Review?,"The SureLife WRS-35H Classic Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor has become a consistent part of my daily routine over the past few weeks. As someone who keeps a close eye on their health, this compact device has been incredibly useful. Despite its petite size, it boasts several standout features, giving it a unique appeal compared to traditional upper-arm monitors. That said, there are a few things to bear in mind.  

**Compact and Lightweight Design**  
Having this wrist blood pressure monitor in hand felt surprisingly convenient. Weighing a mere 6.4 ounces and with its dimensions of 4.1 x 4.1 x 4.6 inches, it's compact enough to carry around, whether at home or on the go. The device fits snugly in my bag, making it a great companion when I need to check my blood pressure while at work or after a workout at the gym. The cuff is quite accommodating, with a size range of 5.3 to 8.7 inches, and it adjusted comfortably to my wrist without any hassles. My mom, who has smaller wrists, found it just as comfortable as I did, which was a pleasant surprise given some wrist monitors tend to be a bit tricky for smaller users.  

**Ease of Use and Automatic Operation**  
What I genuinely appreciated was how simple it was to operate. At the mere push of a button, the monitor automatically inflates and delivers a reading. For someone like my dad, who isn't tech-savvy, this simplicity was golden. He joked that if he could use it without needing an instruction manual, anyone could. The fully automatic functionality ensures that the process is quick and hassle-free, which is great for busy mornings when I barely have time for coffee, let alone fiddling with complicated devices.  

**[Ready to snag SureLife WRS-35H? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://thepressureexperts.com/link/b006c6jc6o/)**  

**Jumbo LCD Display**  
This feature was a big win for me, especially when reading my results in dim lighting. With its large LCD display, the readings are easy to see, even for individuals with poor eyesight. My grandfather gave it a shot and didn‚Äôt have to squint at the screen, which speaks volumes about its user-friendly nature. The clear interface shows diastolic, systolic, and pulse rate all at once, keeping the experience straightforward. I must admit, though, the display lacks a backlight. Checking your stats in a dark room still requires a nearby light source.  

**Irregular Heartbeat Detection**  
One of the more reassuring aspects is its capability to detect irregular heartbeats during measurements. My sister, who faces occasional heart rhythm issues, was thrilled to see such an essential feature included. It was accurate when alerting her, and it brought peace of mind knowing we could catch irregularities early. While I haven‚Äôt personally faced these concerns, it‚Äôs comforting to have added functionality that extends beyond mere blood pressure measurement.  

**Memory Storage for Tracking**  
This monitor can store up to 99 previous readings, making it ideal for someone like me who likes spotting trends over time. Tracking changes daily or weekly is simple, and I‚Äôve already started keeping a personal log with the data. Unfortunately, it's limited to just one user. My wife and I were hoping we could toggle between profiles, but its single-user storage means sharing isn‚Äôt practical unless you keep external records.  

**Pluses**  
- Compact, travel-friendly design.  
- Straightforward to use; ideal for all ages.  
- Large, easy-to-read LCD screen.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Lack of backlight limits usability in dim rooms.  
- Memory limited to one user profile only.  

**Market Rivals**  
This wrist blood pressure monitor faces stiff competition from brands like Omron and iHealth. The Omron Series wrist monitors offer a bit more in terms of memory slots for multiple users but come at a higher price point. iHealth's mobile-integrated models feature seamless data sharing via apps, which is great for the tech-savvy crowd. However, the SureLife WRS-35H stands out for its affordability and reliability in providing single-user readings. It's perfect for individuals who don‚Äôt require advanced connectivity or added bells and whistles, yet it doesn‚Äôt fall short in delivering accurate results.  

**Smart Spending**  
Considering the array of features it offers alongside its compact, easy-to-use design, this blood pressure monitor indeed delivers a smart balance between function and price. It‚Äôs ideal for individuals who prioritize accuracy, portability, and simplicity over multi-user profiles or app-based features. While higher-end models offer additional conveniences, they also come with steeper price tags. This device strikes the right chord for budget-conscious users seeking reliability.

I‚Äôm lost tbh and would love some help. 

# What I‚Äôm Working With:

* **Couch**: This is my #1 priority. I want something comfy with a chaise or a small sectional I can sprawl out on when I‚Äôm solo. Bigger than a tiny loveseat, but doesn‚Äôt need to be massive. I want it to face the TV at a comfortable viewing distance. 
   * Also thinking **side tables** on one or both ends.
* **TV**: It‚Äôs a 65-inch on a stand (open to wall-mounting if needed). This area should feel like a cozy TV-watching zone first and foremost.
* **Accent chairs**: I‚Äôd love to have 1-2 accent chairs if the layout allows. Open to different angles - facing the couch, angled toward the center, toward the TV.
* **Desk**: I WFH 2x/week and need space for a monitor. Doesn‚Äôt have to be huge, but it should be functional.
* **Dining/table area**: Honestly, I don‚Äôt *need* a dining table. I hardly ever use one. I‚Äôd be down with a high-top, island, or even bar seating if it fits - but again, it‚Äôs super optional. Function over form here.
* **Rug**: Definitely need a rug to help define the space.
* **Other details**:
   * I‚Äôve got a **beer fridge** (glass door, mini size, thin and like hip height) and a **bar cart** I might upgrade to a cabinet.
   * A big **full-length mirror** (not against mounting it, but have been using leaned in the corner).
   * Into the **arched arm lamp** vibe that extends over the couch - but need multiple light sources. Not needed for the layout, but just adding. 
   * Open to any kind of **coffee table.**
   * Additional: I have a few blankets, don't have books and have light decor like 1-2 trinkets and candles and such as it stands now. 

**TL;DR:** How would you lay out a living room in a studio with these priorities? I want it to feel comfortable, functional, and not overcrowded, with a clear priority on the TV + lounging setup.

Nine days of solitude, soul-searching, and silent conversations with the universe ‚Äî and I showed up for every single moment. I walked unfamiliar paths, tasted new flavors, stood under quiet skies, and let the wind and fog in the mountains wrap around the pieces of me that needed mending.

This trip wasn‚Äôt just about seeing new places. It was about seeing myself more clearly.

I drove around with no rush, just music, open roads, and my thoughts as my only quiet companion. I woke up early ‚Äî not because I had to, but because something in me wanted to greet the day. Mornings became sacred again, especially those peaceful coffee moments when time slowed down and the world felt kind.

And then there were the people ‚Äî new friends who reminded me that connection can still be warm, light, and unexpectedly healing. Even in my solitude, life found ways to reach me.

Maybe I cried. Maybe I laughed alone in a small cafe or stared too long at a sunset that didn‚Äôt need words. Whatever it was ‚Äî it mattered. Every quiet moment added something back to myself. Bit by bit, I remembered who I am when no one else is watching. And I began, gently, to forgive myself for everything I thought I should‚Äôve been by now.

I am healing ‚Äî not in loud, dramatic ways, but in soft, stubborn ones. Like spring pushing through after a hard winter. Like light slowly returning after a long eclipse.

This trip is a reminder that: I am not lost. I am in the middle of becoming.

I hold on to the hope I found in the mountains, in the mist, in the rhythm of my own breath. I will let it lead me forward ‚Äî not back to who I was, but toward who I am becoming.

And when the days get heavy again ‚Äî because they might ‚Äî I will remember this version of myself. The one who kept walking anyway.

Good luck to us all. May we always find peace every day.

I made up my mind and have some clarity on what would work for me. I'm not rigid but have a fair idea based on my experience from the past long-term relationship.

I also said yes to my parents and signed up on matrimonial websites.

From both fronts, few of the profiles showed interest, which I liked 3 based on photos + bio/profile.

Since AM is a process where parents are involved and even matrimonial profiles on the girl's side are mostly managed by parents (based on my experience), parents have to give a soft ""yes"" so I can proceed to the talking stage and make a rational yes/no call.

On one hand, I want to go ahead and meet 4-5 people IRL and make an assessment of how it works and work on my judgement. It might take some time 'cause I've just begun, and who knows I might click with someone.

Parents, on the other hand, want to wait to get more profiles, preferably someone from mutual connections, and move ahead with a few, considering they'll have many choices. They haven't responded to people on matrimonial websites who have asked for my/parents phone number.

I hate to keep someone hanging. And statistically speaking, it'll be very hard to find someone if parents are stubborn about finding someone from the exact same community. I have however, convinced them to be open to someone from the same caste, even if they are from a different community.

I also feel that things might not click, and if that's going to be the case, I would rather go on coffee dates and refine my judgement/presentability/ etc, than to sit idle and wait for someone to drop from heaven.

I am at a huge conflict on what is the better approach to take. 

Parents want to take it slow - even in the exploration phase - and wait for more profiles to come and have a feeling of ""having options"" to avoid settling.

I want to take agency and act because nothing happens by sitting idle and not meeting people IRL.

Before there are assumptions, my communication with my parents is very open and upfront. We always make decisions after open discussions and mutual agreement. There's no skewed power dynamics here. And since this is about my life, my parents are also very receptive to what I say.

I am also open to dating someone on my own, but given my age, I am open to all avenues.

Josee sighs, Chef would love something so‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ uncultured! Begrudgingly she passes Owen. Rock is a surprisingly good guitarist and gets accepted. Ryan shows off his bench pressing and it‚Äôs impressive.  Kitty shows off some light acrobatics and gets approved as well.

1. Kitty ‚Äì Acrobatics
Kitty performs a series of surprisingly nimble flips and cartwheels, finishing with a perfect split. Emma whispers to Noah her sister has always had some cheer in her. Chef thinks it‚Äôs not bad. Six points.

2. Owen ‚Äì Burping the Alphabet
 He chugs an entire bottle of soda and manages to belch out the whole Alphabet. Sanders assumption proves true, Chef loved it. Nine points.

3. Ryan ‚Äì Lifting Things
He can manage double his own weight, he shows off his skill lifting heavy objects. It‚Äôs impressive but a little dull. Chef only gives it a four.

4. Josee ‚Äì Competitive Ribbon Dancing
Elegant, poised, and full of rage-fueled grace. She snaps a ribbon mid-performance when she has one minor miss step. Ironically Chef‚Äôs favorite part was when she got mad. Seven points.

5. Rock ‚Äì Rock Rocking Out!
Rock blows the roof on the stage to close it out, honestly he‚Äôs pretty good. He admits he plays in a low-key garage band. Chef gives him a solid eight points.

Gophers Total: 34 points.

Killer Bass‚Äô Acts

Jacques and MacArthur both try to take charge. Geoff has to act like the mediator between the three of them. Both of them take up slots while Crimson, Emma, Chet, Tammy, and Tom. Tammy performs with her ocarina while Crimson uses a violin. With only fifteen people they‚Äôre pressed for talent and pass both. Emma sheepishly says she has something she wants to perform as well. Slam poetry. She‚Äôs accepted even if she‚Äôs reluctant to share what it‚Äôs about.

1. Tammy ‚Äì Ocarina Playing
She does fine. Her playing is actually pretty good. She‚Äôs had years of practice during her campaigns with Leonard. Chef is a little bored but the playing isn‚Äôt bad. Six points.

2. MacArthur ‚Äì Sledgehammer Time
Yes, it‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like. MacArthur just smashes harder and harder things with a hammer. Chef loves the senseless violence. He gives her a whopping nine points.

3. Crimson ‚Äì Violin Solo
She plays a haunting, gothic melody that even manages to freak out the usually stoic man. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ kinda afraid to score her low. Eight points.

4. Jacques ‚Äì Ice Dancing Without Ice
Slides around on kitchen trays in a full leotard. Over-the-top and strangely mesmerizing. He didn‚Äôt think to switch it up like Josee did, it suffers as a result. Only four points. Jacques is flabbergasted.

5. Emma ‚Äì Slam Poetry About Her Ex
Heartfelt, intense, and just slightly terrifying. The insults and firey rage are just so entertaining to Chef. He eats it up, giving her a full ten points.

Killer Bass Total: 37 points

Don cheerfully announces the Killer Bass win again! Jacques expresses relief while Noah surprisingly compliments Emma‚Äôs performance with no sarcasm. Josee is furious and storms off to go destroy something and blow off steam. Don turns to the Screaming Gopher‚Äôs and reminds them that this is a double elimination round. Two of you will be going home. The Gopher‚Äôs look nervous as they prepare for their first double elimination. Who wasn‚Äôt talented enough to survive? The choice is yours!

The pressurized basket worked ok with pre-ground coffee but a much faster flow than I'm used to with other pressurized baskets. 

I'll be moving in a few months and don't plan on getting a grinder until then which is why I'm using pressurized baskets.  
  
 I can't use the ESE pods, at least the ones we have now, I have a reaction to them and feel sick all day. I used to have this same reaction to decaffeinated coffee and thought it may be from the chemicals used in the decaffeinating process. Perhaps ESE pods have some sort of chemical or preservative in them. ",1,1746894270.0,gaggiaclassic,2,0.67,False
1kje58s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kje58s/investigate_if_the_urintells_em5220_espresso/,Investigate if the URintells EM5220 espresso machine delivers high-quality coffee in this review,"Espresso machines have a special place in my kitchen, and the URintells Cuising EM5220-US stood out with its promising features. Equipped with a sleek stainless steel design and a modern touch interface, it was hard not to be drawn to this product. As someone who drinks several cups daily and considers coffee-making a ritual, I knew this machine had to be put to the test, from frothing milk to extracting the perfect espresso.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the craftsmanship of this espresso machine is apparent. The black stainless steel body adds a refined touch to my countertop, matching other modern kitchen appliances seamlessly. With dimensions of 12.48""D x 6.14""W x 12.59""H, it‚Äôs relatively compact, making it an excellent choice for limited spaces such as apartments or even office kitchens. I love how lightweight it feels, yet it's sturdy enough to hint at durability. The cup warmer on the top was a pleasant surprise, keeping my espresso cups ready and warm. Even small details, such as the detachable water tank and ergonomic portafilter, reflect thoughtful design.

**Touchscreen Functionality**

The colorful touch interface adds a futuristic vibe, but more importantly, it‚Äôs highly intuitive. A simple swipe or tap allows access to all the machine's features. Setting up espresso shots, making an Americano, or steaming milk for lattes is as simple as tapping icons. Even my tech-savvy teen was intrigued enough to ditch her usual iced caramel macchiato runs and experiment with coffee creations at home.

**Coffee Quality and Brewing Process**

Let‚Äôs talk about coffee, the heart of this machine. The 20-bar pressure guarantees consistent high-quality extraction. Right from the first brew, I noticed a difference in crema. My shots came out with that golden layer on top, achieving the rich aroma and bittersweet taste I crave in a perfect espresso. The pre-soaking technology ensures water evenly penetrates the coffee grounds, offering a balanced flavor. It‚Äôs a game-changer if you‚Äôve experienced uneven extractions with other budget machines.

The addition of an Americano button further simplifies the process, but this is where I faced a snag. Unlike other drinks, the Americano extraction didn‚Äôt always work as expected ‚Äì sometimes producing a double espresso instead. Admittedly, a closer look at the instructions helped fix my mistakes, but it wasn‚Äôt as seamless as anticipated.

**Milk Frothing System**

As a cappuccino and latte lover, the steam wand has become a morning essential. This machine‚Äôs steam wand delivers a powerful performance, producing creamy microfoam that‚Äôs perfect for pouring latte art. While the process requires a steady hand, I appreciated the versatility offered. I‚Äôve tried different types of milk ‚Äì skim, whole, oat ‚Äì and every batch maintained thick foam without overheating. The wand cleans up easily, saving me precious time during hectic mornings.

**Benefits**

- Compact design blends into smaller kitchens.
- 20-bar pressure system extracts consistent and aromatic espresso shots.
- Highly intuitive touchscreen interface.
- Cup warmer adds convenience for coffee lovers.
- Excellent milk frother suitable for a variety of drinks.

**Key Downsides**

- Americano button sometimes fails to execute correctly.
- Steam wand can be a bit loud during operation.
- Cleaning requirements can take a bit of attention, especially if used daily.

**Competing Products**

Having tested other espresso machines in the same price bracket, it‚Äôs worth examining how this model compares. For instance, compared to De‚ÄôLonghi's Dedica EC685, the URintells Cuising poses stiff competition with its added touchscreen feature and superior frothing capabilities. However, while the Dedica occasionally outperforms in heating consistency, it lacks the stylish, user-friendly interface. Machines like the Nespresso Creatista have convenient pod compatibility but fall short on the rich flavor achieved through freshly ground beans. The URintells Cuising strikes a balance, benefiting those who want an authentic caf√© experience without paying top dollar for a premium model.

**Quality for Price**

Considering the machine's multiple features and reliable performance, I‚Äôd say it delivers excellent quality for its price range. Investing in such a device pays off, especially for avid coffee drinkers who frequent cafes. It feels like a barista experience without leaving your house. While there are alternatives offering a similar price-to-quality ratio, the URintells Cuising stands out with its balance of aesthetics, functionality, and performance.

Right now in Ireland we‚Äôre having a lovely weather spell, but I live in an apartment in the city three stories up with no balcony or garden space and I‚Äôm finding it so difficult because the only way I can make use of the weather is to go outside to a public space which I don‚Äôt feel I can always do. Because I‚Äôm right in the city centre, it‚Äôs constantly loud and hectic and it takes a lot of hyping myself up to be able to go outside to do anything (additionally, I‚Äôm a transgender woman and have this constant need to put a lot of effort into my appearance to feel comfortable in public) and it‚Äôs just so exhausting. But because of this I‚Äôm spending all of this time inside and I‚Äôm hearing everyone out there having fun and enjoying themselves and it‚Äôs just doing a number on my mental health and feelings of self-worth.

I don‚Äôt even want to do much, I just want to drink a coffee in the sun and read and feel the regular standard joy of being outside on a nice day, but it feels so inaccessible for me and it bums me out a lot. 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has a similar experience or any advice on how to make this seemingly simple task more surmountable than it currently is? 

Sorry if this is a bit all over the place, I‚Äôm a bit close to it right now and upset.

Emotions are not a reaction to a circumstance. Yet most people are enslaved by their emotions based on lack of awarness.

For example, lets say you sit in a cafe and the waiter spills coffe on your new jacket. You scream and shout at him. One might think that the emotion of anger arises from the fact that he spilled the coffee. But it doesn't. It arises from your perspective on reality and intention. You shout not because he spilled the coffee, but because you give meaning and value to your new jacket and are materialistic. Your intention is to be an authority over someone who you think did you wrong.

So, first comes the goals, intentions and perspective on reality you have, then the impulse, that then triggers the emotion based on your intention and inner framework. You are angry because you, often subconsciously, CHOOSE to be angry.

If you subconsciously think ""nothing here matters or stimulates me"" , your brain may generate the feeling of boredom as a kind of alignment with that internal state! That means if you actively shift your intention to ""life is a fascinating experience that holds opportunity everywhere i look, especially if i look inward"", your whole reality and emotions shift. And with that change in perspective, boredom can be eliminated permanently. Change your inner framework and be in charge of your emotions.",10,1746894203.0,INTP,3,0.92,False
1kje45y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1kje45y/cold_room_warm_embrace/,"Cold room, warm embrace","I had a cherry latte from Starbucks last night, so I knew going into sleep that I‚Äôd have some caffeine coursing through my veins. It was gonna be rough. So I decided to take some melatonin. I had a glass of water and did some breathing exercises before falling asleep.

For those of you who don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm not great with caffeine‚Äîif I have coffee past noon, I‚Äôm usually up until about 4 AM. Pretty crazy for a 43-year-old to still not have this regulated, but here I am, doing box breathing to counteract the bean water. I had it too late in the day. That one‚Äôs on me.

Once I settled into sleep, the next thing I knew, my brain was waking me up‚Äîand I felt well rested. I reached out to find my wife and wrapped my arms around her. It was a tight, warm embrace‚Äîone of those half-asleep but cozy moments.

As my senses started to come online, I began to hear things in the background. My ears tuned in to the sound of the shower running. From a distance, I heard my wife‚Äôs voice, playfully talking to the cats, who had apparently decided to mess with the water.

‚ÄúNo chompies,‚Äù she said, as Sniffles had clearly infiltrated the shower and was taking playful, lunging bites at the falling water.

As my still-groggy brain tried to process this wake-up, a chill came over me. My breath quickened. What had been a cool room suddenly felt hot‚Äîbecause whatever I was holding onto in bed wasn‚Äôt my wife.

I‚Äôve never felt so cold and so hot at the same time.

The shower in the other room felt a mile away. The bedroom turned cold and silent.

I bring up the temperature multiple times here because‚Äîif you know, you know‚Äîit was something unlike anything I‚Äôve ever felt before. The only sound I could hear was the beads of sweat hitting my chest, dripping from my face‚Äîstill pressed against the forehead of whoever (or whatever) I thought was my wife.

It was still. But then, it moved.

That hot-and-cold forehead remained against mine, but I began to hear movement‚Äîsomething slithering.

Then, a thud.

My eyes snapped open.

In that moment, the thing that had been pressed against me slinked off the bed like a snake unraveling.

I was staring into eyes‚Äîeyes that were supposed to be my wife‚Äôs‚Äîbut they weren‚Äôt. The smile was there, but it wasn‚Äôt hers. It was the kind of polite smile strangers give each other while passing on a hiking trail‚Äîjust a slight dimple, nothing warm.

The slinking, snake-like thing, still facing me, fell to the floor. I lay there in bed, paralyzed with fear, trying to make sense of what was happening‚Äîtrying to figure out how to get out of this.

I shut my eyes. That usually made it go away when I was a kid. It‚Äôs worked before. Surely it would work now.

I opened my eyes again, more lucid this time.

Wow. What a weird dream. Everything seemed so real. The room was exactly as I had left it‚Äîthe temperature, the sweat, the sound‚Ä¶

As I started to regain clarity, I realized I still heard something coming from the other room. But then I also realized‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt the shower I had heard.

It was the bathroom fan.

There was no shower. And Sarah isn‚Äôt even home‚Äîshe‚Äôs working a 24-hour shift.

Also‚Ä¶ where were the cats during all of this? Aren‚Äôt they supposed to be like little demon protectors?

I wiped the sweat off my brow and tugged at my now completely soaked T-shirt. ‚ÄúIt was a dream,‚Äù I said out loud. Whether I believed it or not was unimportant.

As my eyes lifted from the fabric, I spotted the kitties. Pickles was crouched down in attack mode. Sniffles was full Halloween cat.

Both of them were side-by-side, locked together and staring. Something had woken them up too‚Äîand it was on the other side of the bed.

All these years, all the work, all the therapy to make this go away‚Ä¶ And it was back.

I've had hypothyroidism for 15 years. I'm currently 40.



Last year, one night I had nausea, stomach pain, bloating, and gas that wouldn't come out. But I also had a lot of cramps and even cold sweats. I had a terrible time. I had to take an antacid that day and a sleeping pill.



The effects lasted quite a while, almost a day. Sometimes I felt the urge to go to the bathroom, but no diarrhea. I usually had loose stools. I discovered it was the milk. So I substituted it with lactose-free products. Then I discovered other foods like gluten, which made me feel really bad, with pain, brain fog, and diarrhea if I overate.



In September, I started treatment for Helicobacter pylori. I'd had chronic gastritis for years. The results were good, and I ultimately tested negative.



When I felt better, thinking the milk problem was due to the gluten, I started eating whole milk products (with lactose) again. It was hard at first, but I got used to it. The fact is that after months, many problems began. My bowels slowed down, causing severe constipation. Not even the famous fiber packets worked. In the end, I had to resort to lactose-free products again, and my digestive symptoms improved. But I also had other symptoms that wouldn't go away. Fatigue, dry eyes, anxiety, depression... I joined the gym again and was always raving about it. I went three times a week and was always loaded with supplements or didn't even have the energy to go.



I discovered that dairy products, even lactose-free, were also bad for me. After giving them up, I noticed an improvement. I could wear contact lenses without my eyes getting red as often, had more energy, and was much less anxious. The key was drinking one of those cold coffees they sell in supermarkets. It gave me extreme anxiety and even a panic attack.



The funny thing is that soy products are similar to me. They make me feel bad too. So I need to look into coconut or similar products.



**My question is this: The lack of lactase causes diarrhea almost constantly. But in my case, it caused the opposite. Intestinal blockage, cramps, anxiety etc.**



Why did I initially get better with lactose-free products, but then not?



I don't have any symptoms of anaphylaxis, hives, or anything like that. Although I have had more dandruff at times. Although that hasn't gone away completely now either.",1,1746894045.0,lactoseintolerant,0,1.0,False

For those who have limited capital but possess a vision for their dream restaurant, leasing equipment can be an excellent strategy to protect and preserve the financial resources of the business. This approach allows restaurateurs to allocate their funds more effectively, investing in other critical areas such as marketing, staffing, or enhancing customer experience. Additionally, financing options can be particularly advantageous for under-capitalized businesses that are eager to open new locations or upgrade essential equipment, such as a high-quality grill or state-of-the-art kitchen appliances.

There's¬†**ZKP2P**, which runs on the Base execution protocol. It allows any web event to be used as an input in a self-executing smart contract. That means a payment on Web2 or a centralized payment system like Venmo or Revolut can be used ‚Äî trustlessly ‚Äî to execute a token swap on Ethereum. It's permissionless, it's trust-minimized, and it works by proving fiat payments without exposing any private data. In other words, this becomes an on-ramp that doesn‚Äôt require a centralized peer-to-peer fiat-to-crypto platform. It just uses Ethereum.

The next project I‚Äôm very interested in is¬†**Aztec Network**. This is a rollup-based execution protocol that settles to Ethereum and is built from the ground up to allow privacy. Privacy is the biggest missing element right now in the blockchain space, and Aztec has completely committed itself to making it a normal part of blockchain-based finance. It lets developers build smart contracts where inputs and outputs are encrypted by default, using a system they‚Äôve built around their custom AVM and the Noir language. It‚Äôs aiming to make privacy programmable, not just bolt it on.

Next up is¬†**Tornado Cash**. Tornado Cash is the most widely adopted privacy protocol in the world. It‚Äôs also suffered the most intense state-level attack any protocol has ever faced. The U.S. government actually sanctioned it, adding immutable smart contract addresses to its SDN list. Those sanctions were later struck down in federal court after a long legal fight. Developers were criminally charged under the previous administration, and those charges may now be on the way out under the new Republican administration. But regardless of how the cases unfold, the sheer intensity of the attack shows the potential that Tornado Cash has to disrupt global finance. Ethereum already lets people transact peer-to-peer by default. But when you add privacy, those peer-to-peer payments become usable in any context. You can pay your contractor, your barber, your rent, or your coffee ‚Äî without exposing sensitive financial history to your counterparty.

The next one I'm very interested in is¬†**MegaETH**. MegaETH is a totally modular project ‚Äî really a full execution environment ‚Äî that uses EigenLayer and EigenDA for its data availability. Validation and consensus are handled by Ethereum, and execution is done on its own high-throughput EVM. By taking the best from every part of the modular stack, it achieves the greatest scalability of any blockchain in history, all while staying fully Ethereum-aligned. Even its off-chain data availability is cryptoeconomically secured via restaked Ether. EigenLayer shows that Ethereum‚Äôs modular scaling roadmap isn‚Äôt just feasible ‚Äî it allows for a system that will eventually exceed the scalability of centralized Web2 apps. And it proves that restaked ETH can act as economic glue, aligning off-chain systems with Ethereum‚Äôs trust model.

The next project I‚Äôm very excited about is the¬†**ZKVM**¬†being created by RISC Zero using RISC-V. They‚Äôre building a system that can prove an entire Ethereum block with a zero-knowledge proof. That means even very lightweight devices will be able to validate full Ethereum blocks without running a full node. That opens the door to Ethereum eventually scaling to 10,000 transactions per second, without compromising hardware accessibility or end-user verifiability.

Then there‚Äôs¬†**Base**. Base is right now the leading Ethereum execution protocol. It rolls up on Ethereum using the Optimism stack. It has no token, so it‚Äôs fully ETH-aligned, and it‚Äôs backed by Coinbase ‚Äî arguably the most important company in crypto. Base is proving that the Ethereum scaling roadmap is the best in the world, and it‚Äôs bringing Ethereum‚Äôs magic to the entire world. Coinbase‚Äôs laser focus on UX is essential, especially now that scalability bottlenecks have been largely solved with the maturation of the rollup construct.  
  
And finally,¬†**BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL fund**. This one might be the most institutionally important. BlackRock launched a tokenized fund ‚Äî on Ethereum. It holds U.S. Treasuries, distributes yield daily, and it already surpassed $1.5 billion in assets. It‚Äôs the first time the world‚Äôs largest asset manager issued a fund directly on a public blockchain. That‚Äôs not just adoption ‚Äî it‚Äôs anchoring traditional finance to Ethereum. And it signals that the Ethereum settlement layer is credible enough for institutions managing trillions. It‚Äôs hard to overstate how big that is.

There are many more Ethereum projects that I am very excited about, but these are the first few that come to mind.
