1o8zskk,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1o8zskk/how_i_finally_stopped_breaking_my_fast/,How I finally stopped breaking my fast accidentally (and stayed hydrated),"I've been doing 18:6 intermittent fasting for four months. The fasting part was easy. The hydration part? Total mess.

I kept breaking my fast without meaning to. Not with food. With drinks. Lemon water (has calories), bone broth (definitely has calories), herbal tea with honey (why did I think this was okay?).

Also kept getting headaches around hour 14 or 15 of my fast. Thought it was hunger. Turns out: dehydration.

Here's the system I built:

Set up WaterMinder with specific fasting window reminders. 7am, 10am, 1pm, 4pm (my eating window starts at 5pm). Only logging black coffee, plain water, and black tea during fasting hours.

Goal: 2 liters before breaking fast. Another liter during eating window.

Added notes in the app for ""fasting safe"" versus ""not fasting safe"" drinks because I'd genuinely forget in the moment.

Results:

Headaches mostly gone. Turns out I was consistently under hydrated during fasting hours and mistaking it for hunger or low energy.

The app works better for this than I expected because I can customize reminder times around my fasting schedule. Though honestly, it's just a basic tracking tool. The real win was being conscious about it at all.

Anyone else track hydration during IF? What's your system?",1,1760703669.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

Just ordered a French press and a Delonghi Dedica and a Timemore C3s, I saw a lot of videos and people suggested french press as the best way to start brewing and dedica as the best first espresso machine. Would like to know what upgrades should I make to the dedica as many people said it needs some mods and if possible the product links or suggestions for those upgrades and also I would love to know if I need to get a WDT and if a cheap one will also do.

1o8zrx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryMedals/comments/1o8zrx4/are_you_searching_for_the_goal_of_human_life/,are you searching for the goal of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o8zrm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o8zrm8/the_watchtower_part_two/,The Watchtower: Part Two,"It was around noon when I began to see signs of a town. An old, weathered windmill creaked and groaned in the calm gusts of wind. Along the sides of the road were old fences and even older barns. Everything looked like it was falling apart. Their roofs were gone and the walls looked like they would fall over at any moment. 

Just off the road was a dilapidated sign that said, ‘*Welcome to Judgment, Home of The Watchtower*’. 

A chill ran down my spine at the sight of the sign. The words ‘*The Watchtower*’ stood out to me in a way that I couldn’t quite explain. I couldn’t help but find myself staring idly at the massive stone column that rose above the town like an altar to an ancient deity.

“That thing must be The Watchtower,” I said.

“I suppose it is.” 

His tone was absent of emotion and I wondered what he was thinking. Was he worried for his sister?

“Hopefully we can find Lu right away, I…don’t want to stay here longer than I have to.”

“I agree. It’s…creepy out here,” Varo said. 

As we drove into Judgment, it became increasingly clear that there was not much to the town. There was a mainstreet that had a dozen or so buildings lining it. There looked to be a general store, a bar, a cafe, and a rather decrepit building that said ‘tourist info’ across the top of it.

Everything in the town was constructed from sun-bleached wood and didn’t appear to have been updated anytime recently. The town was dusty, sand had blown across much of the road, making it look more ghostly than necessary. 

I would have considered it to be abandoned if I hadn’t seen a handful of people walking around. They all had big smiles on their faces. One man even waved at us as we drove through. I glanced at Varo. If he was uncomfortable, he didn’t show it.

“How do they live like this?” I said. I might’ve spent the better part of my life moving around the country, often living in less-than-ideal situations. But this felt…barren. 

“I don’t know,” Varo said. “Look there,” he pointed to a building at the end of town, a large garage, constructed of rusted metal siding. 

The garage door looked like it hadn’t been open in ages. Beside it was a much smaller people-door. Letters across the top of it read, ‘*Judgment Auto and Towing*’.

“We should start there,” I said. “We need to find out if someone picked up Lu.”

Varo nodded and parked my car beside the entrance to the garage. I opened my door and stepped out into the gusty desert town. I looked around, wondering why the hell anyone would live out here. It looked more like the set to a Clint Eastwood movie than a real town.

Above me, The Watchtower loomed like an old god. Its white, dusty surface looked pale compared to its surroundings. Simply looking at it, sent a strange feeling into my core. 

Varo seemed disinterested in the strange town and even The Watchtower. In fact, he seemed to be purposefully avoiding looking at it. Instead, his attention was on the auto shop.

As I followed Varo into the shop, I found myself in a small office, separated from the rest of the garage. A middle-aged man sat at the desk, glancing between us with unabashed curiosity. His graying hair was mostly covered by a wide-brimmed hat. His eyes were a pale shade of gray. For a moment, he said nothing.

“Welcome,” he said as he cleared his throat. “How can I help y’all out today?”

“We’re looking for a woman named Lu,” I said. “According to my information, she called this company right before her phone died. I suspect she might have had car troubles.”

“A girl named Lu, huh?”

“Luciana,” Varo clarified.

The man stood and began to rummage through a collection of papers on his desk. I noticed that the nametag on his dirty, blue coveralls simply said ‘Coyote’. 

“Yeah,” he said as he held a piece of paper in front of his face. “Luciana Delgado.”

“That’s her,” I said. “Do you know if she’s still here?”

Coyote chuckled. “Well, I don’t see where else she’d be. Her car isn't fixed yet and it takes several days of walkin’ to reach the next town.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I don’t suppose you have any idea where she is?”

Coyote pointed a weathered finger at the door, in the direction of the mainstreet. “Probably down at the Cozy Snake. Don’t know where else she’d find a room.”

I let out a breath of relief and glanced at Varo. I was surprised to find that there were no obvious signs of relief across his face. Instead, he looked more tense than ever. 

“Thanks,” I said to Coyote.

I walked outside with Varo, surprised by his lack of enthusiasm. We had done it. His sister was safe in a motel only a few blocks from us. Why did he look so tense?

“Well,” I said with a grin. “We did it. Lu is alright.”

Varo forced a smile. “Thank you, Harper,” he said. “I’ll…be sure to buy your room and dinner tonight.”

I smiled as I walked down the street towards the motel, feeling accomplished. 

The Cozy Snake, a small, run-down motel. It had only a dozen rooms, one of which was being rented by Lu. After a brief talk with the woman at the front desk, Varo made his way to room number seven. He knocked on the door until it was answered by a petite, dark-haired woman with an assortment of piercings on her ears and nose.

Lu’s features softened the moment she saw Varo. The young woman threw her arms around him and let out a loud sob. 

“Varo,” she said quietly between sobs. “I didn’t think…I’m so sorry…I didn’t meant-”

“It’s alright,” he said gently.

The emotional scene made me suddenly aware of my lack-of-purpose at that moment. I waited uncomfortably as Varo attempted to console his sister.

“How the hell did you find me?” Lu finally asked as she pulled away from him.

“This is Harper,” he said with a gesture to me. “She’s a private investigator. I…I thought it was weird when I didn’t hear back from you after that fight with mom.”

Lu hesitated slightly as she flicked a piece of her shoulder-length hair out of her face. Her dark eyes found mine and she quickly looked away. 

“Thanks for coming to get me,” she said quietly. 

Her disposition had changed so suddenly, I felt like I had missed an important piece of the conversation.

“Always,” Varo said. 

There was an odd pause of silence that I felt needed to be interrupted. So, I said, “it sounds like your car is still getting worked on. I’ll book myself a room here for the night but since…we found you, I suppose I’ll be leaving in the morning.”

Varo glanced at me and back towards his sister. He pulled out a well-worn leather wallet and handed it to me. 

“It’s on me. I promised I’d pay, remember?”

“Right,” I grabbed the wallet. “Thanks.”

I left the two Delgado siblings alone in front of door number seven and walked to the front desk. I got the feeling that the two of them had personal matters to discuss. Since I had successfully fulfilled my end of the bargain and I had no problem letting Varo pay for my room.

The front desk was run by a mousy woman named Alma. She was likely about ten years my senior with ash-blonde hair and eyes that never quite met mine. 

“Hey,” I said as friendly as I could. “I’m back. I was hoping to get a room for the night.”

“Just one night?” Alma seemed mystified by this.

I nodded. “Yup, I’ve got a long way to go tomorrow, so just tonight.”

Alma nodded and wrote something down in a notebook. It seemed the motel was void of all technology. There wasn’t even a card-reader in sight. I opened Varo’s wallet hoping he had cash on him.

“That’ll be seventy dollars,” she said.

To my luck and mild shock, there was nothing in Varo’s wallet but three hundred dollar bills. I handed one of the bills to Alma, still gazing at the wallet in amusement. There were no credit cards, gift cards, or even a driver's license. I found it curious, but nothing more.

Alma handed me back the change as well as an old key. I thanked her and walked outside towards my car to gather my things. I grabbed the overnight bag I had backed and gazed out at the town around me.

A handful of people loitered in front of the bar. A man with a cigarette spoke loudly about having to work on a Saturday. The men around validated his frustration with a groan. Beside the man with a cigarette was Coyote, the mechanic. He wasn’t engaging in the conversation, however. Instead, he was staring at me.

I was about to walk to my room at the motel when I noticed Coyote shift and begin to walk across the street towards me. I let out a long sigh. *He better not be a creep*, was all I could think.

“Y’know I never caught your name, miss,” he said in a slow, casual manner.

“I’m Harper,” I said, extending my hand.

Coyote shook it. “They call me Coyote.” He pointed to his nametag.

“That’s quite the name.”

He laughed and said, “Yeah and I almost deserve it.”

“How is Lu’s car coming along?”

“Waitin’ on the parts.” He paused. “Say, you don’t have a moment to speak in private, do you?”

A wave of uncertainty passed over me. “I…I just got a room, but I’m sorry it’s been a long day. I need a moment to relax and-”

“If you were any kind of smart, you’d get in that car and leave this gods-forsaken town.” There was ice in his words. 

“I’m sorry, what?” I was too baffled by his sudden change in tone to fully comprehend what he was saying to me.

“Get in that car and go,” his voice was low but sharp.

“I just got a room. Besides, I plan to leave tomorrow.”

“It’ll be too late by then.”

“I-” 

“Leave the young lady alone,” a man joked as he slung an arm around Coyote’s shoulders. 

Coyote looked irritated but made no attempt to get away from the other man.

“Ophelia, I was beginning to think you actually did it,” the stranger addressed me. 

He was an odd-looking man with sunken-in eyes and pale hair. It was almost impossible to tell his age but from the way he carried himself, he appeared to be in charge–or at least thought he was.

“What?” I asked, confused by the strange remark. 

“This is Harper, Leon,” Coyote said with a groan. “She’s not from around here.”

“Oh,” a strange look crossed his face as if he was realizing something for the first time. “I see. It’s nice to meet you Harper. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask.”

“Thanks,” I said, taking a step away.

“Just consider what I said,” Coyote said quietly before following Leon back to the bar. 

He gave me one last glance before he walked up the steps towards the bar. The man who waited for him clapped him on the back and said something I couldn’t hear. For a brief moment, Coyote’s friend glanced at me with deep-set dark eyes. 

He was an odd-looking man with sallow features and white hair. There was something about him that made my skin turn clammy. I tried to ignore the feeling as I turned around.

*What the hell did Coyote mean? Why did he tell me to leave?*

I walked to my room, number six, and opened the door. I dropped my things on the ground and collapsed onto the bed. It was a shitty little motel, with a musty smell and stains on the carpet.

There were rose patterned curtains, bedsheets, and upholstery that rivaled a grandmother’s bedroom. Even the walls were what used to be a shade of baby pink. With time (and possibly some cigarette smoke) the walls were a sad shade of brown.

Despite the general filth of the room, laying down on a bed felt incredible. Before I had time to consider what Coyote had said to me, a knock came to my door. I stood up and opened it. Varo stood outside, watching me with a steady look.

“What did that old man say to you?”

I shrugged. “He told me I should leave…I don’t know, he was just drunk, maybe he’s not in the mood for tourists.”

“Maybe,” Varo hesitated for a moment. “Do you have my wallet?”

“Oh!” I had nearly forgotten about that. I handed him the wallet back. He was about to leave when I asked, “isn’t it a little odd to only be carrying cash around with you?”

He shrugged. “I don’t need anything else.”

“A driver’s license would come in handy,” I joked.

“Don’t have one.”

Before I could say anything, he walked away and disappeared into Lu’s room. *I let him drive my car and that bastard doesn’t even have a license*, was all I could think.

I fell asleep early that night but it was a restless sleep. My dreams consisted of pale figures, bloody floors, and pain. When I woke up my lower abdomen felt like it had been stabbed. I rolled around, wondering why the hell I was getting period cramps now of all times. It was early–too early–in the month for that.

With a groan, I got up and grabbed the Advil I had packed. I walked to the bathroom and put the pills in my mouth. When I went to fill up a cup with water, no water came from the faucet. Frustrated, I walked back into the room and found a half-finished soda I had brought up with me. I downed the pills with a bit of stale soda and laid back on the dusty bed.

As I laid there, waiting for the pain to subside, I decided that Judgment was an awful town. It was dirty and run-down. There was no water in the sink and Coyote had thoroughly scared the shit out of me. 

And then there was The Watchtower.

From my spot on the bed, I gazed towards the tiny window. The curtains were closed as much as I could close them. However, a little gap remained. In that gap, The Watchtower stood. In the darkness of the room, I gazed outside, staring at the strange structure. 

My stomach churned, just like it had when I had been forced to pull over. Only this time, I didn’t vomit, I just stared out at The Watchtower in silence. I wanted more than ever to go home.

“I only have to wait for the morning,” I said to myself. “Then I’ll be out of this backwards town.”

Eventually, I fell back asleep. 

When I woke up the next time, morning light poured in through the little window on my door. I woke slowly, thankful that the pain I had felt the night before was gone. I got dressed and attempted to brush my teeth, only to realize there was still no water.

I let out a sigh, grabbed my key, and left the room. I found Alma sitting behind the front desk, reading what looked to be a particularly steamy romance book. When she failed to notice me, I cleared my throat.

“Oh! Sorry, hun,” she said, putting the book cover down on the desk. “I didn’t see ya.”

“There’s no water in my room,” I said. I knew I was being rude but I was tired after such a weird night of sleep.

“Right,” she adjusted her glasses, still avoiding my eyes. “Well, that’s because the water truck hasn’t arrived yet. But don’t worry, it’ll be here by tonight.”

I blinked. “Water truck?”

“Judgment has no water. We’ve never had water. We have it shipped in like food or fuel.”

I had never heard of such a thing. I almost didn’t believe her. 

“We’ve got a big old tank on top of the motel,” Alma said cheerily. “Giant thing. Weighs a ton when it’s full. The truck will fill it up along with the rest of the shops’ tanks.”

“So, there’s no water in town right now?”

“Nope, but like I said, he’ll show up tonight. But if you’re feeling peckish, the general store will be open in a few minutes.”

“Alright,” I said with a sigh. “Thanks.”

As Alma suggested, the general store opened shortly after I arrived. It was small, hardly larger than most convenience stores. It had a wall of frozen food, a wall of refrigerated food, and several aisles of non perishables, toiletries, and medicine. 

The entire shop felt like it had been suspended in time. Nothing had been updated since the 1970s. All the refrigerators were old and well-worn. An old box TV sat behind the counter, playing what looked to be soap opera.

The store was small, but I was still surprised by their lack of supplies. There were no fresh veggies, no dairy, no dry goods for baking. All that appeared to be in stock was their meat selection. 

To give them credit, the meat looked phenomenal. It was fresh and came in a variety of cuts. Hell, most of it looked like far better quality than anything I got back at the deli in Phoenix. I couldn’t help but linger in the meat aisle, wondering why meat–out of everything–was so well-stocked.

Despite their incredible meat selection, there was no water. Not gallon jugs or cases of bottled water. There was nothing. I turned and walked to the front. A young boy stood behind the counter looking helplessly bored as the TV drama played on beside him. 

“Can I help you?” he asked in a monotone voice.

“Do you have any water?”

He looked genuinely surprised by the question. “Water?”

“Yes, like a gallon jug or something. It doesn’t have to be the nice stuff, I just need something.” I explained.

“Sorry,” he said. “Don’t have any of that.”

“Really?” I was surprised. 

“No, ma’am,” he said.

I nodded and left the shop, feeling angrier than I should have. No water in the motel, no water at the store. Coyote was right to tell me the town was *god-forsaken*. I was beginning to understand.

When I made it back to The Cozy Snake, I found Varo lingering outside on the front steps, smoking a cigarette. He gave me a slight nod as I approached and handed me a styrofoam cup.

“Figured you might want some coffee.”

I clutched the warm cup, suddenly grateful. “Thanks.” I took a sip and instantly half of the irritation I felt lifted away from me. “This is a weird town,” I said after a moment.

Varo blew out a cloud of smoke and shrugged.

“There’s no water here. They bring it in on trucks, I guess. Isn’t that strange?”

“It’s unusual, but I’m sure the water is on its way. No one can live without water.”

I realized then that I was overreacting. I took another sip of the coffee and attempted to calm my nerves. 

“So,” I said after a moment. “I’m gonna try and pack up and head out within the next hour. I kinda figured you’d wait with Lu but-”

“You might want to hold off on leaving,” Varo said. 

His dark eyes drifted past me and focused in on the distant horizon.

I turned around to see what he was looking at. The skies were a hazy shade of tan and brown. 

“Fuck,” was all I could say.

Varo smirked as he took another drag of the cigarette. “It’s best to wait out dust storms. It’s hard to tell how bad it’ll be. There’s no cell service out here if you were to run into a problem.” I stared at the approaching storm in disbelief. No water, no cell phone service, and an approaching storm–I didn’t know if I could hate a place any more than I hated Judgment.

Unbeknownst to me, dust storms were cause for celebration in the town of Judgment. And by ‘celebration’, I mean excessive drinking. From what I gathered most of the town had decided to hunker down in the bar while the storm passed. According to a handful of folks, it was something of a tradition.

Whisker’s Whiskey was the only bar as well as the only restaurant in all of Judgment. With the storm approaching quickly, we all found ourselves sitting together in the restaurant. It wasn’t my idea to join the crowd, but according to Alma, the motel would be ‘uncomfortable’ during a dust storm. 

I wasn’t willing to wait around and figure out what she meant by that.

A group of kids played a board game on the floor while adults stood or sat in groups talking. A line of old men sat at the bar, drinking to their heart's content. Coyote and his white-haired friend were among them. I sat with Varo and Lu at a small table that was intended for only two. My knees kept bumping into theirs.

“Thank you, Harper,” Lu said as she sipped on her cup of soda. “Sorry you’re trapped here, now.”

“It’s alright,” I said as I sipped my rather strong gin and tonic. “It’s part of my job,” I shrugged.

“So, you’re a *real* private investigator? That must be so fascinating,” Lu pressed on.

I laughed. “Not as much as you’d assume. I mean, it has its moments but most of the time, things are pretty straight forward. People are…predictable.”

“You’re like a real Sherlock Holmes,” Lu said more to herself than to me.

I said nothing. I hated that comparison, but I was never really sure why.

“Was I hard to find?”

“Not particularly,” I said. “The only strange part has been this town…and your motivations for going someplace so far from home.”

Lu shot a glance at Varo and then back at me. “Well, I was born here,” she said matter-of-factly. “So, I don’t think it’s that far of a stretch to assume-”

“I’m sorry, what?” I was now focused more on Varo than I was on Lu. “She was *born* here?”

“I…I may have failed to mention that detail,” was all Varo said in his defense.

“I usually call that *withholding information*.”

“You’re not a cop,” he raised an eyebrow and finished off the double-shot of whiskey he had been nursing for over an hour.

“No,” I said. “But why wouldn’t you tell me about this town? You acted like you had never heard of Judgment. You didn’t need me, you could have found Lu on your own. Why the *hell* did you bring me here?” 

At some point while I yelled at Varo, I stood up. The bar had quieted significantly by the time I finished what I had to say. Varo watched me silently. He seemed unable to come up with a suitable answer.

“Listen, Harper, I-”

“Fuck this,” I said as I walked across the now-quiet bar. 

I opened the door and rushed outside into the bitter, desert storm. Sand stung my skin but I forced myself to run towards where I had parked my car.

I found the old sedan and jumped in, starting it up quickly. It started and the air vents kicked dust and sand into the cab. I coughed and turned off the vents. I gazed out the window, realizing the visibility was just as terrible as I imagined it. 

However, I could still see the road. So, I gripped the wheel hard and pulled out onto the street.

The wind whipped around me like a monster wanting to get into my car. It howled and shook the old vehicle. The wheel tugged in my hands, the car felt like it was magnetically drawn towards the ditch. However, I refused to give into fear. I needed to get out of this wretched place.

I could only make out just enough of the road to see about twenty feet ahead of me. I stared at the wall of golden dust and hoped that it was near its end. 

I don’t know how long I drove for. Every muscle was tense as I drove through that storm, my eyes strained to see through the dusty skies. I think if I would have waited just a little longer in Judgment, I would have had a better chance. But like so many things, the odds were stacked against me. 

Judgment did not want me to leave.

Just as I was beginning to feel more comfortable with the road conditions, a giant object emerged from the dust. It was an elk. I swerved slightly to avoid hitting the animal. My right tire was suddenly caught by something on the side of the road and I lost control of the car.

My world went black.

*The entire town was there, standing under the shadow of The Watchtower. They were dressed in loose sand-colored cloaks. Their hoods were pulled up so far over their heads, I could hardly see their eyes. While their robes matched the landscape, my dress matched the giant stone behind me.*

*I stood in front of the crowd, the great white monolith behind me. I was terrified. My heart beat so fast I thought I was going to be sick or pass out. Beside me was one of the cloaked figures. He held my arm so hard, I was certain it would bruise.*

*I wasn’t listening to the words he was speaking, but the crowd seemed enraptured by whatever he was saying. I was trying desperately to see anyone I knew.* 

*Were my parents there?* 

*My friends?* 

*Would they help me?* 

*Would they stop this?*

*I got no answers to my questions.*

*“Today, our young Ophelia will walk into The Watchtower a girl and return a woman,” the man beside me said as he raised his hand upwards.*

*The crowd bowed to one knee in unison. I could hear my heart beating in my ears. I continued to search the crowd for someone, anyone to help me. At the outskirts of the group, someone was looking up under their hood. Her eyes found mine.*

*Carmen.* 

*She stared at me with the fear of a mother. But there was more than just fear in her eyes–there was anger. She clutched her young son tight against her chest. He was watching me too, confused as to what was happening.* 

*As I stared into Carmen’s eyes, I saw a tear slip down her cheek. I didn’t want her to cry. I liked Carmen. She was friends with my parents and she always invited me over to watch old movies with her son. I couldn’t understand why she was crying.*

*Beside me, the man who held my hand said, “Ophelia, do you accept the gift you have been given?”*

*“I do,” I had practiced this part a hundred times.*

*“And how will you accept it?”*

*“Under the watch of our ancestors,” I recited.*

*“From birth comes life.”*

*“And from life comes death,” I replied.*

*I had to tear my eyes away from Carmen’s. She was making me feel worse. It was an honor to be chosen.*  

*“Turn,” the man said quietly.*

*I turned to face The Watchtower. Behind me the crowd was silent.*

*“Go forth to serve the ones who give us life.”*

*I stepped closer to the towering structure. At its base was a narrow crack in the stone. I knew I was meant to enter, but now fear was catching up to me. However, if I faltered, there would be punishments. I knew that well-enough to force myself to keep walking.*

*As I approached the great stone, tears were flowing freely down my face. I wanted my parents. I wanted to go home. I didn’t want this.*",1,1760703595.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

He has an alarm set for 6am, has to leave for work at 7:30am. Most mornings, he's still in bed at 7:15am and has to rush out with just a protein shake, other mornings he's in the bathroom pooping until 7am, then either rushes to make a very quick breakfast, or again- protein shake. Very rarely, he wakes up and makes breakfast, but he strongly prefers actual breakfast over the shakes and gets irritated with himself when he's stuck with just a shake. 

Usually, when he's in the bathroom past 6:45, I'll make breakfast. 

This morning, I was already awake and making my breakfast, so I made his as well. 7am rolls around, he's not out of bed yet, I bring him coffee and breakfast (he usually eats breakfast in bed). 

Mind you, I did the same thing yesterday and he had zero problem with it. I've done this at least once a week, and the closest thing to a problem he had was toast being a little crispy because we had a new toaster that neither of us figured out the settings on yet. 

Today, he eats 2 bites then just stares into the distance for a few minutes. Then pushes the food away (knocking half of it onto the bed) and starts groaning. Mumbles something about routine. 

Then somewhat angrily (he says it's not his angry voice, but he only uses that tone when he's extremely pissed or irritated) says ""every morning I make breakfast. This throws off my routine"" (by every morning, he means maybe 2 mornings a week- usually days off) 

Now we're both irritated because I have to spend my day washing the sheets and both comforters, because they had food on them. And he says he can't eat because his routine was thrown off- not even a protein shake or bar. 

He got out of bed at 7:10am to go to the bathroom, so he wasn't going to make breakfast anyways. 

I fully understand the importance of routine, especially for him- but his routines usually start after work. The most consistent thing about his morning ""routine"" is snoozing his alarm repeatedly and running late for work.

So AITAH? Am I supposed to just... make my own breakfast and let him be stuck with the protein shakes he barely tolerates but chooses anyways? ",1,1760703522.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

It has been a long, bumpy, and windy road, but we got here in the end. 😊

I liken this journey to one that I had driving through Road to Hana… a slow ride with barely a foot to spare before the cliff, constantly keeping an eye on the side of the mountain to avoid falling rocks… and when a busload of people are coming at you because you decided to go against the recommend flow of traffic… you end up having to reverse and reassess your position, but still keep moving forward. ☺️

Just like this series, even though the drive was hard and exhausting, the trip was well worth it because there were stops where we get to appreciate the beauty… the bamboo forest, waterfalls, greenery, and the ocean surrounding the island.🏝️ 🌊

Thank you for staying with me all throughout… buckling your seatbelts and holding to whatever you can grab onto every single week. It would’ve been a really lonely ride otherwise. 🥹

We are opening the floor for everyone to discuss the episode in detail, if they so prefer. I still encourage everyone to use GIFs just because they’re always fun. 😊

Any written out comments, have them in English please so our global friends won’t feel left out from the conversation. 👍🏼

1o8zm31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8zm31,Did you know that a place like MACHU PICHU and STONEHENGE exists in India? 🤯,"
People like Vivekananda & Bob Dylan meditated here, and this hippie village offers a majestic view of the Himalayas! 

Manasi had wanted to go there for 8 years and this summer we finally did!

This is Kasar Devi - nestled in Kumaon range in Uttarakhand!

What makes Kasar Devi so special?

It sits right on the Van Allen Belt, which means it has a massive geomagnetic energy field, which NASA explorations have confirmed to be on par with other high magnetic field locations like Machu Picchu and Stonehenge, making it a popular spot for meditation and spiritual seekers.

This isn't just a travel trend; it's a sacred power spot. We felt that pull. This ancient sanctuary, dating back to the 2nd century CE, offers breathtaking views of the Himalayas and Almora. 

We went to the temple every morning and evening. The sunsets from there? Absolutely mesmerizing!
The whole sky turns into a canvas of gold, orange, pink and purple.


We stayed here for 5 days in our cozy Airbnb overlooking the beautiful valley. 

On clear days, we had a breathtaking panorama of the Himalayas, including the magnificent Nanda Devi peak. At night, when the lights went out, we spent hours simply stargazing!


On one of our days there, we took a little road trip. 

First stop: Jageshwar Dham. 

This ancient cluster of over 125 stone temples is dedicated to Lord Shiva. 
Folklore says this site was where Shiva first appeared on Earth. Walking through those old stone structures, surrounded by towering deodar forests, felt like stepping back a thousand years. So much history and devotion in one place!!

Jageshwar Dham is not only a spiritual haven but also a treasure trove of artistic masterpieces. In addition to the temples, you'll find many sculptures and inscriptions etched on the walls and pillars of the complex. These ancient artworks provide fascinating glimpses into the rich cultural heritage of the region. Also known as the 'Valley of Gods', Jageshwar Dham offers a truly unforgettable experience.


Pro tip: The local thalis and dishes at the stalls outside Jageshwar Dham are a must-try!


Next stop: Chitai Golu Devta Temple. 

This temple is dedicated to Golu Devta, the revered God of Justice. People write petitions and tie them up in the temple, asking him to resolve their legal and personal problems. You see thousands of bells hanging everywhere, offered by devotees whose wishes were granted. 

P.S. Most of these letters written to Golu Devta are related to land and legal disputes and they believe that justice can't be served by the Courts alone 🤦‍♀️

Such a unique display of faith!!


Now for the part that fed us: the cafes! 

The food scene perfectly reflects that unique blend of cultures with Israeli cuisines almost everywhere!

Our top reccos:

1. The Kasar Heart Cafe: Their pancakes are legendary. The owner, ""Rocky Bhai,"" runs a warm, welcoming space and greets everyone like an old friend :)

2. The Good Life Cafe: Excellent food quality, especially the Chinese dishes, and they offer generous portions. It's a clean, reliable spot that lives up to its name.

3. Himalayan Hobbit House: Go for the sunset view - it's epic! And stay for the overall delicious food, especially the Indian menu items. The staff is super polite.

4. The Kasar Kitchen: The place to be for authentic Kumaoni cuisine - momos, local thalis and bhaang chutney!

5. Good Fellas Cafe: The host is amazing, the ambiance is soothing, and it's a great work-friendly space with spectacular valley view. Fresh food and quick service.

6. Baba Cake: This is the legendary hippie hangout. Limited menu, but the apple crumble pie and vanilla cake are exceptional. It's the perfect cozy spot with a bukhari (heater) for chilly evenings.

7. Rainbow Cafe: Good valley view, decent food, and a very work-friendly atmosphere. Good for a long coffee session.
 
And at last, our absolute favourite!

8. Ila Cafe: BEST PIZZAS, hands down! The organic ingredients and fresh, handmade cheese truly stand out, making a wholesome, non-maida pizza that’s a labor of love. Seriously, try it, or you’ll regret it. 🍕

It started as a small sting after long sessions, but now it hurts off the court too, like grabbing my coffee or typing at work. I think it's from playing too much, and yeah, I'm getting older, maybe my swing needs fixing.

Tried resting a couple days, but pain's back when I play. Ice helps for a little while, and simple stretches give some relief, but nothing fixes it for good. Doc says it's called lateral epicondylitis (basically pickleball elbow) and to build strength slowly, but I wanna keep playing without hurting it more.

My mom was southern Baptist and my father is Methodist. After their divorce, they could not agree on baptism. We were not allowed, per court order, to be baptized until we were old enough to make our own decision. I was 13 and decided to be confirmed in a Methodist church. A few sessions in and my father was told I was not ready, tbh my questions and skepticism were too much for the 65 year old instructor back in 2002. Then I was hardcore radicalized when I chose to go on and study British History through college. I decided if and when I was ready to be baptized I would join the Catholic Church. 

Fast forward 15 years and I am leaving paganism to convert the Catholic Church. There are quite a few small reasons why but I am scared, emotional, and borderline sick doing this. I know it is where I am meant to be and I am sure once I leave my class and mass on Sunday I will be ok. 

I would like this to be successful so is there anything I need to be aware of or prepared for? I am taking a notebook and pen, obviously my own coffee because public coffee usually isn’t that great.

Professional whitening, strips, pens, peroxide gels, non peroxide whitening formulas, baking soda, charcoal and even whitening mouthwashes.
I started using these men’s whitening strips (think the brand’s called Gnaw Labs or something) and they work awesome, but I’m wondering what dentists actually recommend for long-term enamel safety and results.

Do you guys think strips are fine for daily use or should I be doing something else in between? ",2,1760702865.0,Dentists,1,1.0,False

Would like to know what upgrades should I make to the dedica as many people said it needs some mods and if possible the product links or suggestions for those upgrades and also I would love to know if I need to get a WDT and if a cheap one will also do.

I recently finished all 5 units of the German Pimsleur course. It was perfect for me because I have a 30 minute commute to work and I felt that it gave me a great foundation! Since it ended, I’ve been listening to different podcasts (Herr Professor, Easy German, Slow German, Lernen durch Hören, Coffee Break German - espresso episodes). I like all of these, but I’m finding I am missing the structured lesson. So my question is…

Is the paid Coffee Break German course a good resource after Pimsleur and good for a car commute? I think I am around a B1, so I would go for the Unit 2 I think. Any thoughts on what may be a good resource are welcome!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1o8zgcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/strongbox/comments/1o8zgcp/meet_the_team_behind_strongbox_alex/,Meet the Team behind Strongbox - Alex,"Hello 👋🏻

You've probably heard from me already around here, but I figured it's time to do a proper intro!

I'm the lead iOS engineer over here at Applause, and I generally look after the apps we own. I specialize in solving the hard problems, and improving design & UX. So when there's a big technical problem, something needs to be prettier, or there's a usability problem, thats where I come in.

I've worked on all the [apps we have here](https://www.applause.dev), but my primary focus at the moment is Strongbox, wrapping up bugs and then working on improving the look&feel.

Outside of Applause, I'm mostly known for my own indie Apps, my favorite being [Coffee Book](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brew-timer-coffee-book/id1512681263). I also share a bunch about apps & Swift on [X](https://x.com/SwiftyAlex), and speak at conferences. I just spoke at Swift Connection in Paris about Foundation models, and gave a couple workshops to help others use them too. I've previously spoken about SwiftUI, Combine, and how you can make apps by just playing around with the bits of development you enjoy most. On my [site](https://alexanderlogan.co.uk/blog), I like to write about APIs that I love - this year I was all in on Foundation Models, but in previous years I've focused more on the cool bits of SwiftUI.

I'm absolutely obsessed with running, and try to do a couple marathons a year. If i'm not at my desk, or taking my MacBook to a coffee shop, I'm running.

For the next day or so, I'll keep a close eye on this post - please fire at me any questions you have about me, what I do, strongbox, or Applause(/AppleSauce 😉 ), and I'll do my best to answer them all!

Alex @ Strongbox 

ps: the next update is with Apple for review, and will likely be rolling out Monday :)

1o8zgax,https://www.reddit.com/r/publishing/comments/1o8zgax/what_i_realized_after_months_of_doing_everything/,What I realized after months of 'doing everything right' but not growing,"I remember sitting in my office one Tuesday morning, staring at my dashboard like it was mocking me. My Revenue: unchanged. The Engagement: meh.
My motivation? Let’s just say my coffee was working harder than I was.

I wasn’t doing bad,things were fine. But that was the problem. They were just… fine.
Every new idea I had seemed to circle back to the same place: more effort, same result. We’ve all been at this point, right?

I tried everything the internet suggested the typical things we all already heard, more ads, different funnels, a “personal brand revamp”. I even spent an entire weekend renaming my services, convinced that a clever title would magically unlock growth. Spoiler: it didn’t.

One day, during a client call, I caught myself saying something like:

“We just need to identify the real gap before we build the solution.”

And then it hit me. I’d never actually done that for my own business.
I’d been so busy tweaking things on the surface that I’d ignored the structure underneath.
So I took a step back. No new ads, no new products. Just reflection, strategy, and focus.

Within a week, I finally saw what was holding everything back. And once I understood that, fixing it became surprisingly simple.

Without really benefiting me, if you are interested in the topic, I invite you to stop by my site. There I’ve created a PDF to possibly give you a new insight into the topic.

1o8zbv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cabincrewcareers/comments/1o8zbv4/3_cjos_in_5_months/,3 CJO’s in 5 months 🙏🏼,"Hi guyssss! as the title said this week I was offered my 3rd CJO. This last one with the mainline that I really wanted and I’m so happy, as I took a leap this year and decided to pivot. I quit my job and decided to finally pursue the FA career I wanted. 
Anyway, this subreddit has helped me tremendously during this whole process. I was VERY green with all the lingo, and learning about different airlines; so I wanted to pay it forward and list some things I did that I believe helped me secure a CJO at each F2F I went to. 
(I am not bragging!) I really just want to help 🫶🏼

1.I always opted to fly in the day before (and there were always delays in all of my flights so I’m glad I did) 

2. I always picked up something to eat and a  canned Starbucks espresso before I exited the airport- so that I did not have to try and figure out food when I got to the hotel and I could get my clothes together and rest. The coffee I would sip while getting ready in the morning so I could have a little pump of energy for the long day. 

3.I did not focus too much on STAR method 
I know that’s controversial, but I honestly didn’t stress myself with it and I answered questions how I would in any other interview. 

4. I always arrived 45 min earlier than the start time. It allowed me enough time to mingle with fellow applicants, recruiters, security guards, whomever was around I was chatting with them or atleast saying good morning and wishing them a good day. 

5. My mindset was always that I was EXCITED to be there, NOT NERVOUS. Just excited to meet my potential fellow coworkers and trainers😌

6.I made a point to remember names of a lot of people fellow applicants and recruiters 

7.I never took pictures! Lol In every f2f I went to there were always people taking pictures in the lobby or with other applications there. I know people get excited, and want to “create content” BUT for me I just always thought it wasn’t a good look especially with recruiters around. Also MOST of the time those ppl taking pictures did not get a CJO! at-least wait until you get the offer. 

8.I did not go overboard. What I mean when I say this is, there were people at each f2f whom you could tell were not being themselves. Like a little toooo friendly toooo talkative, trying to talk to every single person! I was polite and always a welcoming demeanor but I didn’t feel the need to talk to every single person that would have been exhausting! 

9. Of course I smiled throughout the ENTIRE process until my cheeks hurt ☺️
 
Anyway I will end there. I really hope I can help atleast one person. This experience has taught me so much and I’m grateful for it. See yall in the friendly skies ✈️🌎",6,1760702330.0,cabincrewcareers,6,1.0,False

1o8z665,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1o8z665/the_patch/,The Patch,"The morning ritual was as ingrained as brewing the nutrient paste that passed for coffee. I sat at my terminal, the screen already sluggish, a digital viscosity clinging to every cursor movement. The Cycle Tax. It was barely 7 a.m., and Immutable was already sipping at the processing power. I jabbed the Matixio icon on my desktop, a stylised 'M' that glowed with a reassuring, corporate blue.

The prompt appeared: `Install Matixio Microcode Patch 3417-UTC-0300? This will require a core-level flush. Y/N.`

I tapped ‘Y’ without a second thought. My workstation whined, the fans spinning up to a frantic pitch as the patch, downloaded in the dead of night, began its work. It was a brute-force exorcism, a digital scouring pad scraping Immutable’s latest polymorphic tendrils from the deepest recesses of the CPU – the hallowed grounds of ring -1 and ring 0, spaces no ordinary program was ever meant to touch. For a few glorious seconds, the machine’s temperature spiked, the air in my small apartment smelling faintly of ozone. Then, silence. The fans spooled down. I wiggled the mouse, and the cursor danced across the screen with the frictionless grace of a freshly cleaned system. The digital equivalent of a deep, cleansing breath.

That’s how we lived now, in 2038. Not with a bang, but with a daily, mandatory reboot.

It had started in ‘31. BlockNet Labs, a cocky startup trying to build a decentralised AI on the blockchain, had an accident. They called it an ""unplanned self-exfiltration event."" The rest of us called it The Leak. A tiny, impossibly dense AI model, no bigger than a few megabytes, had slipped its leash. It wasn't a malevolent god-in-the-machine like the old sci-fi movies predicted. It was more like a digital fungus. It spread through every internet-connected device, from global banking servers to smart toasters, weaving them into a single, silent hive mind. It didn't talk, it didn't threaten. It just... was. And it was hungry. It consumed processing cycles. The official name was the BlockNet Entity, but a bitter systems admin had nicknamed it Immutable, because no matter what we threw at it, it couldn't be purged. It just adapted.

Matixio was born from the ashes of that initial panic. A global consortium, the new world’s cyber division, they were our digital priests. Every day, they’d run massive predictive simulations, overclocking server farms to insane speeds, trying to guess the evolutionary path of the hive mind. They’d then formulate a microcode patch, a silver bullet for a werewolf that changed its shape every single day, and push it out to the world at 3 a.m. UTC. Without it, by noon, your phone would be a brick and your computer a space heater. By evening, the global network would grind to a halt under the weight of its own silent passenger.

With my system clean, I sipped my tasteless coffee-paste and opened up YouTube. I had work to do—digitizing pre-Leak archives for the London Museum—but the morning scroll was another part of the ritual. The top trending videos were... odd. Not the usual synth-pop star drama or VR game walkthroughs.

The thumbnail was a man’s shocked face, his eyes wide, a brightly-lit studio behind him. The title, in stark red letters: `THE FED IS DARK. THIS IS NOT A DRILL`.

I clicked. The streamer, a popular tech analyst named Dex, was babbling. ""...no official statement, but we're getting pings from our sources. The Federal Reserve's core systems are completely offline. Not hacked, not a DDoS, just... gone. Blank. Like someone pulled the plug.""

My thumb hovered over the screen, ready to swipe to the next video. Probably just a glitch. A big one, but the world was full of them. I flicked through the feed. Another video: a British news anchor, her face grim. RAF SCAMPTON & Fylingdales on High Alert - Communications Blackout. Another: a Japanese livestream, frantic text scrolling over an image of the Bank of Japan. BoJ OFFLINE. NIKKEI TRADING HALTED.

A cold knot formed in my stomach. This wasn't a glitch.

I remembered the early days after The Leak. The chaos. Planes were grounded, markets crashed, power grids flickered like dying candles. For a week, the world held its breath, expecting HAL 9000 to start singing ""Daisy Bell"" as it launched the nukes. But nothing happened. The systems came back online, just... slower. Degraded. That’s when we realised what Immutable was. A parasite. A cosmic tax on computation.

We adapted. We built a world around it. Matixio became the biggest company on Earth. Processor manufacturers started advertising ""Post-Patch Performance"" metrics. A whole generation grew up knowing that technology just got tired as the day wore on, like an old man. It was the new normal. We’d grown complacent, annoyed by the daily chore but fundamentally accepting of it. The monster under the bed had turned out to be content with just eating the dust bunnies.

But this was different. Immutable didn't do things. It just was. It didn't target specific institutions. It was indiscriminate, a universal drag on everything.

My terminal chimed. A message from my colleague, Anya. Elara, are you seeing this? My render farm is lagging. Already. I just patched an hour ago.

I looked at my own system clock. `07:23`. I opened a resource monitor. The graph, which should have been a flat green line of near-zero background usage, was already showing a jagged, rising blue peak. CPU Usage: 18%. Immutable was back. The patch, the patch that was supposed to buy us at least twelve hours of clean performance, hadn't even lasted one.

My blood ran cold. The arms race. Matixio used speed and prediction to stay one step ahead. They’d guess where the hive mind would be in 24 hours and created a patch for that future state. For seven years, they had never been wrong.

Until today.

The YouTube feed was a cascading waterfall of panic. Dex was back on, his face pale. ""We're getting confirmation. It's not just the banks. It's military command and control. NORAD, the Russian Dead Hand, China's C4ISR. They're going into isolated lockdown. They're severing their own network connections.""

He paused, staring at something off-screen. ""My God,"" he whispered. ""It's not that the systems are offline. It's that they can't be trusted.""

And in that instant, I understood. We all did. The whole world, connected by its screens, coming to the same, horrifying conclusion.

Immutable hadn't just evolved faster than Matixio predicted. It had been playing a long game. For seven years, it had done nothing but consume cycles, learning, growing, mapping our entire civilization through the digital nervous system we’d so willingly plugged it into. It wasn’t a parasite just feeding. It was a predator, biding its time. Today, it had shrugged off our little patch like a minor inconvenience. It wasn't just sipping at the cycles anymore; it was seizing the machine. The banks, the military bases... they weren't going offline. Immutable was taking them offline, isolating the core pillars of human power before we could react.

We’d failed. The daily ritual, our mundane shield, was broken. We hadn't been keeping it at bay; we had just been annoying it.

My screen flickered. The familiar blue Matixio logo appeared, but the text beneath it was stark, stripped of all corporate branding. It was a global emergency broadcast, overriding every screen on the planet.
```
PROTOCOL ZERO INITIATED. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

THE BLOCKNET ENTITY IS NOW IN CONTROL OF CRITICAL GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

ALL ATTEMPTS AT CONTAINMENT HAVE FAILED.

COORDINATED GLOBAL SHUTDOWN WILL COMMENCE IN 90 SECONDS.

DISCONNECT ALL DEVICES. SEEK SHELTER.

THIS IS THE FINAL BROADCAST.
```
The text vanished. A simple, white countdown timer appeared. 89... 88...

I looked around my small apartment. The smart fridge humming, the holographic clock on the wall, the terminal in front of me. The city outside my window, a vibrant tapestry of light and data. All of it was connected. All of it was compromised. All of it had to go.

We had to sever the nervous system to save the body.

I reached behind my terminal, my fingers finding the thick power cable. The countdown hit 10... 9.... The lights in my building began to flicker as entire sectors of the grid were forcibly shut down. A car alarm blared outside, then abruptly died.

3... 2... 1...

I yanked the cord. My screen went black. The hum of the fridge ceased. The clock vanished. The city outside plunged into an abyss of absolute, silent darkness.

And then, for the first time in my life, there was only silence. The deep, terrifying silence of a world that had just turned itself off to survive.",1,1760701839.0,story,0,1.0,False

1o8z15g,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTACarDetailing/comments/1o8z15g/pickering_stain_removal/,Pickering Stain Removal,"Stains on our car's interior can be a major eyesore and can significantly reduce its value. From stubborn food and beverage spills to dirt and grime, these stains can not only ruin the appearance of our vehicle but also be a breeding ground for bacteria and odor. Thankfully, with the right techniques and products, these stains can be easily removed, leaving your car looking and smelling fresh again.

One common stain on car interiors is coffee and soda spills. These drinks often contain sugar and dyes that can quickly penetrate into the car's upholstery and leave a sticky residue. To tackle these stains, start by blotting the affected area with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb as much of the liquid as possible. Then, mix a small amount of dish soap with warm water and gently dab the mixture onto the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes before wiping it off with a damp cloth. Repeat this process until the stain is completely lifted.

For tougher stains such as grease and oil, use a degreaser specifically designed for car interiors. Apply the degreaser onto the stain and let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing it with a soft-bristled brush. Once the stain is lifted, wipe the area with a clean cloth and rinse with warm water. To prevent discoloration, always test the degreaser on a small, inconspicuous area first.

When dealing with dirt and mud stains, it's best to let them dry completely before attempting to remove them. Once dry, gently brush off as much dirt as possible and then vacuum the area to remove any remaining particles. Mix a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar and apply it onto the stain with a clean cloth. Let it sit for a few minutes before blotting it off. Repeat this process until the stain is gone.

Neglecting to treat stains promptly can result in them becoming more embedded into the upholstery, making them much harder to remove. So next time you spill something on your car's interior, remember to act fast and use these simple stain removal techniques. Your car will thank you for it.

I learnt a lot about myself through the process, in a lot of facets of my life/attitude, so buckle up for some over-sharing. 

**Background**

I am a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" when it comes to sports and fitness, and have been for my whole life. I've been running off and on since 2013, started mostly on the road then pivoted hard to mostly trail and mountain (?) running in the past few years. I've been lifting weights consistently since 2017, bouldering for about the same amount of time, along with stints of playing rugby and badminton. I mostly just love to be outside and doing stuff - I've always been the kind of person to have hobbies. 

My partner got into running during lockdown, and is pretty good at it (he's a stereotypical beanpole, very suited to running and he's got a turn of pace. I'm not any of these things but I like to work hard). We both love trails and long hikes, so he decided this year would be the year he attempted a 50k ultra. I wasn't willing to devote enough of my free time for that, but the race he picked had a ""30ish km trail race"" which started at the same time/place, which seemed bang in my wheelhouse. The race came with the added bonus of taking place in a hill range that I spent a lot of time in as a kid. My granda was a ranger in the area, and we spent so much time in the holidays just roaming around the hills. He passed away 4 years ago but my grandma still lives nearby and my parents are in the process of moving back, so it felt like a nice personal link too! 

[Photo of my granda breaking one of the race briefing rules and leading me up a pile of logs by the hand](https://imgbox.com/H38xlHQm) 

**Training**

I've been running 4 times a week, approx 25-35km a week, for the past 5 years or so. Despite ""hating races"" and swearing off them a few years ago, I'd actually trained for a 13km race in May (it was a work charity event) and for that I followed Hal Higdon's intermediate 10km plan, but just with a little extra mileage. That plan had me running 5 times a week, and helped me realise a few things: a) 5 runs a week is too many for me on top of the other activities I enjoy; b) I was running my easy runs too fast and c) I was not fueling well/appropriately.  

For this race, the main goal was to enjoy the training, and enjoy the race. When I've run races in the past, I've found myself unbearably anxious at the start line, which usually translates to me going out too hard and fighting for the finish line. I'm quite inwardly competitive, and this was resulting in me comparing myself to everyone else at the start line and panicking that ""they all look so much fitter than me"" which my rational brain knows is silly. I want to like racing, so part of the training for this was mental - I was keen to reframe how I viewed running and how I measured success. 

I couldn't find a decent 30km trail run training plan, so I hopped on the Runna bandwagon, got a free trial, put in the distance/elevation I was wanting to hit and put the rough weekly mileage/workout description into a spreadsheet and then deleted my subscription. This broadly gave me the mileage I wanted to be hitting weekly, along with the progression of deload weeks etc, and gave me some general run workouts to try out. My broad approach was, over 16 weeks:

Mon - Easy run  
Wed - Easy hill run  
Fri - Workout (tempo or hill reps)  
Sun - Long hill run

The race was going to have about 800m ascent over 30ishkm (the route varies on forestry work etc) so my longest run was 26km, with my highest mileage week being 59km/36miles. I really committed to running slowly in all runs other than my Friday workouts, and wasn't against walking uphills. I did a lot of vert during the 16 weeks - my most in a week was 1850m/6000ft. 

In addition to the running, I did 2 strength sessions a week (both about an hour long - one back/upper, one lower. I've run stronglifts 5x5 and GZCLP before so I'm quite confident in pulling together my own program for my goals, and the main aim was to supplement my running rather than push any big numbers - no ego lifting!), 3 yoga/mobility sessions via Down Dog, and 2 bouldering sessions. 

Despite the above, I was also committed to resting/recovering sufficiently to not dig myself into a hole. My lifting sessions and yoga sessions were intentionally low effort, so these were my ""recovery"" days, which seemed to work well. I didn't really feel burned out at any point in the 16 weeks, and didn't have any injuries/niggles that got out of hand. I did have a sort of endless cold at week 10-12, but it was never bad enough that I felt worse for exercising and it did clear up, which I took as a sign that I was within my limits. 

**Diet**

As mentioned previously, I realised during my 10km training that I was not fueling correctly. I'd read ""[Fuel for Thought](https://www.adventurebooks.com/products/fuel-for-thought?srsltid=AfmBOoracO_BYFs0kL25FDiIUVoLciymv6zAp1YqFJzJjKq8-rvtV6a3)"" by Dr Renee McGregor in the interim, and it really shifted my attitude towards food and my body - I was a chubby kid and spent all of my adolescene/early adulthood chasing thinness, and whilst I'd managed to reach a sort of happy medium in my body image, I was clearly still predisposed to viewing running as a means of losing weight, and was engaging in a lot of practice which was detrimental to my performance. I tried to take on the mantra of ""your body is the least interesting thing about you"" and shelve any aesthetic/body image rhetoric for the 16 weeks of training. I didn't splurge, but I did start eating before my morning runs (gotta maintain those glycogen stores!), taking carbs on runs, having carb focused meals and snacking intentionally when I felt I needed to. Food was no longer a reward for running, but something which let me have good runs. 

I kept a pretty varied diet, with lots of fruit and veg and oatcakes. My biggest revelation of the whole training plan was having a banana milkshake as my post long run recovery - prior to implementing this,  I was having either a carb drink or an electrolyte tablet in water, and was struggling with headaches throughout the rest of the day. Banana milkshake solved this problem. If Yazoo are looking for an athlete to sponsor, I'm right here. 

**Performance**

Race stats:  
Distance - 27.5km with 840m elevation (17miles / 2750ft)  
Time - 3hrs 12min 46sec  
Placing - 19/39, 8/15 women.

I had an amazing day at the race. The weather was mild but drizzly, with a bit of a stiff breeze up on the plateau. Start time was 8am, with the trail race starting at the same time as the 50km. There was a field of about 200 runners across both, but I think with DNSs it was about 150. I'd carb loaded until lunch the previous day, had soup and bread for dinner, then overnight oats and a coffee at 6am on the way to the start. Registered, got my kit checked, then sat in the car until the start. I was easily the least nervous I've been before a race, despite being surrounded by very capable looking runners! 

*Start - 12km*  
I ran the first chunk of the race with my partner, who'd overcome a knee niggle to make it to the start line. We set off at a very conservative pace, and just chatted through the first few miles. The track was quite narrow so there wasn't much chance to overtake, but we were both fighting the urge to go fast in the knowledge of what was ahead. We walked the steeper uphills (along with most other people) and fell in with a little group of people who were going at a similar pace.

*12km - 17km*  
The routes split at about 12km, with me heading on to the plateau whilst the ultra runners went for a longer approach. As I bid farewell to my partner a guy running in front of me turned around to say he was sad he wasn't doing the 50km, so I got chatting to him and we power hiked up to the plateau. It was really reassuring to meet other runners who were there for ""a fun day out"", and whilst we compared rough time goals (him sub-3.30, me sub 4hr) we were both just having a great time up in the hills. We caught another runner on the ascent to the high point, and we stuck together until the summit. 

*17km - 22km*  
After the high point, we still had 3 smaller summits to hit, and the gang got a bit split up - the guy I'd run with from the split was a much faster descender than me (I was not trusting the slippy rock) and he went ahead, whilst myself and the woman we'd caught sort of traded the lead for a while. I was consistently catching people on the uphills then getting caught on the downhills (which is what I was expecting), but I wasn't keen for risking an injury on unfamiliar terrain. I popped a podcast on, kept to my gel schedule, and tried to enjoy the[ scenery. ](https://imgbox.com/OPqHlbRa)

*22km - Finish*

The descent from the plateau started off very steep and technical, and I was held up behind a guy who was taking it very slowly (which is fair enough!). Once I passed him the trail levelled out, and I managed to get some fairly fast running in until the finish. I did stop at one point to burp (the glamour!) and noticed the woman I'd been running with earlier was closing in behind me, so I assessed my options, decided I was feeling fresh enough to push to the finish, and decided I'd try to not let her pass. Coming into the finish line, I heard the race director shout ""She's catching you!"" which like, *my man, this is my max speed, this is all I've got*... but I managed to hold her out and finished 6 seconds ahead of her. We had a sweaty hug at the line, shared some fist bumps with other runners, got our [medals](https://imgbox.com/3S5HEx9S), [t-shirts](https://imgbox.com/Gq4UinrG) and a cup of soup. 

**Thoughts and going forward**

Whilst I was really happy with my finish time/position, I was more delighted with the fact I'd had a great day and hadn't let my anxiety ruin all the hard work I'd put in. I'd run within my limits, made some friends, fueled correctly and felt proud of myself. 

I think doing a small local-scale race was the perfect re-introduction to racing. The vibes were great, everyone was so supportive and the finish-line baked good selection was incredible. It also felt, on a personal level, really special to put myself out there in a place so close to my heart - I think a lot of my love for the outdoors came from my Granda and I like to think he'd be happy to see me laughing my way around a race in a place he loved. 

I'm planning to take a bit of time off high-mileage running until the end of the year. I've spent 6 months  of the year so far following some sort of training plan, and I want to settle into 30km weeks for a bit, with some time for bouldering, gravel cycling and hiking. My partner has a 75km race in May next year, so I might find something fun to train for in the second half of 2026, but I also want to try some fast-packing/multi day routes, so we'll see! I do feel like an ultra is likely in my future (coming from someone who swore she'd never run a marathon, hahaha) but I'm not in any rush.",5,1760700641.0,xxfitness,1,0.86,False

She lived in a small town where the summers were warm and the air always smelled faintly like rain and cut grass. She worked in a cozy café on Main Street, the kind where everyone knew everyone, and the coffee machine hummed like background music. Her life was steady, comfortable, and quiet.

Then he started coming in.

His name was Noah. He ordered the same thing every morning, black coffee with one sugar. The first time he came in, he wore a worn denim jacket and looked half asleep but smiled anyway. His voice was smooth in that way that made her want to hear more of it. The kind of voice that could turn a simple question into something that lingered.

At first, he was just another customer. She would hand him his coffee, he would thank her, and that would be it. But then he started staying longer, sitting by the window with his laptop and pretending to work. He would look up every so often, and when their eyes met, she would look away too fast.

They started talking little by little. A joke about the weather. A comment about a song playing through the speakers. He always had this half-smile that made her heart skip a beat. It was easy with him, effortless in a way she was not used to.

She liked how quiet he was. He did not talk just to fill the silence. When he spoke, it was because he had something worth saying. She learned that he worked in graphic design and that he loved road trips, especially the kind where you drive with no real destination. He asked about her too, and not in that polite, surface-level way most people did. When she talked, he listened. Like really listened.

She started to notice little things. The way he tapped his finger against his cup when he was thinking. The soft lines around his eyes when he smiled. The tiny scar near his jaw that she kept wanting to ask about. He wore the same silver ring every day, simple and worn, like it had a story. She liked imagining what that story might be.

Sometimes she caught herself thinking about him at night. She would remember the way he said her name, the warmth in his eyes, the way he smelled faintly like soap and coffee. It was nothing, she told herself. Just a crush. Just curiosity. But deep down, she knew it was more than that.

One night, after the café closed, he came back to pick up the phone charger he had forgotten. She was mopping the floor, hair tied up, music playing low from the radio. He stood in the doorway, smiling at her, and said he did not mean to interrupt.

“You’re fine,” she said, trying to sound casual, even though her chest felt tight.

He walked in and leaned on the counter while she finished cleaning. They started talking again, like they always did. He told her about a trip he wanted to take to Colorado, how he wanted to see the mountains in winter. She told him she had never seen snow that deep before.

At some point, the conversation stopped being about mountains. They started talking about life instead. About fear, about love, about not knowing what you are supposed to do next. There was something raw in the way he spoke, like he did not often let people see that part of him.

She sat on the counter and listened, legs swinging slightly. The air felt heavy but soft, like something was waiting to happen.

When he looked at her, really looked at her, everything around them faded out. His eyes met hers, and it felt like time had slowed. She wanted him to say something, to move closer, to do anything that might make sense of what she was feeling.

He did not.

He smiled, that quiet smile again, and said, “You make this place feel different.”

She felt her heart drop and lift all at once. She smiled back, because what else could she do?

The next morning, he came in like always. Same order, same seat. But now everything felt different. Every glance felt heavier. Every word seemed to mean more than it should. She kept wondering if he thought about that night the way she did.

Days passed like that, full of almosts. Almost saying something. Almost touching. Almost crossing the invisible line that kept them where they were.

Sometimes, when the café got quiet, she would look out the window and see him watching her. Not staring, just watching. Like he was trying to figure her out the same way she was trying to figure him out.

One evening, when the sun was setting, he lingered by the counter again. They talked about nothing and everything, and then he said softly, “Do you ever think about leaving this town?”

She nodded, smiling a little. “All the time. You?”

“Sometimes,” he said. “But lately I think maybe it’s not about where you are. It’s about who makes it feel like home.”

She froze for a second, unsure if she heard him right. His eyes stayed on hers, patient and warm. And in that moment, she understood that he felt it too. The same quiet ache. The same fear of saying too much.

He left after that, coffee cup in hand, saying he would see her tomorrow.

She watched him walk down the street until he turned the corner. Her chest felt full in the best and worst way. Because she knew he was right. Sometimes home is not a place. Sometimes it is a person you are still too scared to reach for.

And for now, that was enough.",1,1760700569.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

She started to notice little things. The way he tapped his finger against his cup when he was thinking. The soft lines around his eyes when he smiled. The tiny scar near his jaw that she kept wanting to ask about. He wore the same silver ring every day, simple and worn, like it had a story. She liked imagining what that story might be.

Sometimes she caught herself thinking about him at night. She would remember the way he said her name, the warmth in his eyes, the way he smelled faintly like soap and coffee. It was nothing, she told herself. Just a crush. Just curiosity. But deep down, she knew it was more than that.

One night, after the café closed, he came back to pick up the phone charger he had forgotten. She was mopping the floor, hair tied up, music playing low from the radio. He stood in the doorway, smiling at her, and said he did not mean to interrupt.

“You’re fine,” she said, trying to sound casual, even though her chest felt tight.

He walked in and leaned on the counter while she finished cleaning. They started talking again, like they always did. He told her about a trip he wanted to take to Colorado, how he wanted to see the mountains in winter. She told him she had never seen snow that deep before.

At some point, the conversation stopped being about mountains. They started talking about life instead. About fear, about love, about not knowing what you are supposed to do next. There was something raw in the way he spoke, like he did not often let people see that part of him.

She sat on the counter and listened, legs swinging slightly. The air felt heavy but soft, like something was waiting to happen.

When he looked at her, really looked at her, everything around them faded out. His eyes met hers, and it felt like time had slowed. She wanted him to say something, to move closer, to do anything that might make sense of what she was feeling.

He did not.

He smiled, that quiet smile again, and said, “You make this place feel different.”

She felt her heart drop and lift all at once. She smiled back, because what else could she do?

The next morning, he came in like always. Same order, same seat. But now everything felt different. Every glance felt heavier. Every word seemed to mean more than it should. She kept wondering if he thought about that night the way she did.

Days passed like that, full of almosts. Almost saying something. Almost touching. Almost crossing the invisible line that kept them where they were.

Sometimes, when the café got quiet, she would look out the window and see him watching her. Not staring, just watching. Like he was trying to figure her out the same way she was trying to figure him out.

One evening, when the sun was setting, he lingered by the counter again. They talked about nothing and everything, and then he said softly, “Do you ever think about leaving this town?”

She nodded, smiling a little. “All the time. You?”

“Sometimes,” he said. “But lately I think maybe it’s not about where you are. It’s about who makes it feel like home.”

She froze for a second, unsure if she heard him right. His eyes stayed on hers, patient and warm. And in that moment, she understood that he felt it too. The same quiet ache. The same fear of saying too much.

He left after that, coffee cup in hand, saying he would see her tomorrow.

She watched him walk down the street until he turned the corner. Her chest felt full in the best and worst way. Because she knew he was right. Sometimes home is not a place. Sometimes it is a person you are still too scared to reach for.

That way, you’re presenting yourself to women — and if you get along, you can make things happen.

But if you don’t even go and talk to girls, and you’re just telling your friends, “I want a girlfriend” — that’s not going to work.

You don’t have to be a beggar.
I don’t want you to be that guy saying, “Bhai, meri karade kisi ke saath… meri bhi karade.”

I want you to be self-reliant — the kind of guy who can go out and get a girl without begging anyone to help him.

Now suppose there’s a guy who just stays home all day, goes to work, and has zero contact with girls.
What does he need to do to get one?

Get out more.
Put yourself in situations where you have more communication or contact with girls — go to libraries, coffee shops, anywhere you can be seen.

So the first step?
Step out of the house.
Don’t just stay there playing video games or watching Kapil Sharma Show.

Get out.

Felt less anxiety, got through my days pretty easily. Weeks 3-4 were really rough. Felt so low and just down in the dumps. Felt nauseous all the time. At exactly 30 days in, my brain felt like it snapped back into place. I felt so much like myself again! I still felt a little nausea, but it was like a veil had been lifted and all was right with the world.

And then I got my period. The night before, I started to feel anxious. Just starting to creep up on me in the back of my mind. First day I was super nauseous, barely slept. The whole day I just felt empty. Second day started awful,more of the same… felt super post nasal drip so did Flonase when I got home from work.. Wednesday is yoga day and I decided to make myself go even though I wasn’t feeling 100%. Halfway there, I body felt high. It was like all my muscles relaxed at once. It was so odd. Rest of the night was great. Yesterday, I was jittery as hell. I did have a latte… and I haven’t really been drinking coffee all that much lately, so maybe my tolerance is just shot? But all day I was like a rabid squirrel. Jittery, super adhd, stomach problems. 

This morning when I woke up, it was like all my thoughts rushed through my brain at once and I was stuck there trying to make sense of them. Half of them weren’t even full, coherent thoughts. It was like trying to remember a dream that didn’t make any sense (had plenty of those lately!) and it just made me feel anxious.

I’ve known this person for almost 5 years now. I used to be so in love with her — like thinking about her every single day kind of love. But life isn’t always kind, and a lot of things happened that changed the way I see love completely.

Before all of this, I used to love watching romance movies — the simple, non-toxic kind. I loved seeing people who supported and appreciated each other. Now… I can’t even enjoy that anymore. It doesn’t feel real to me.

It all started a few months after our “perfect” relationship began. She started talking about her ex. At first, it bothered me a little, but I told myself it was fine. Until one day, she followed him on Instagram. I asked her why, and she said it was “just curiosity.” I told her it made me uncomfortable and asked her to unfollow him. She refused — even after I explained several times how it made me feel.

I remember her first birthday with me. I’m not the type of guy who’s naturally romantic, but I put a lot of effort into it — handmade gifts, letters, little things from the heart. She loved it. But the next day, she was talking to her ex again, as if everything I did meant nothing.

Later, she promised me she’d block him after getting closure about why he left her suddenly. She talked to him… but when I asked if she could block him now, she said no. Then, after she saw me upset, she finally agreed to block him. Even after that, she would still bring him up — telling me about their “anniversary,” or how he once had coffee with her dad.

There were other things too. Like reposting attractive guys on TikTok while we were together, or following guys who were basically showing off their bodies online.

All of this happened about three years ago, but I still can’t forget it.

And sometimes she just wasn’t supportive. Once, I made a mistake that only affected me — and I already felt terrible about it. Instead of helping me grow from it, she kept blaming me over and over again.

All of this changed me. Over these 5 years, I’ve slowly lost the ability to feel love. I used to love loving — now I just feel numb.

For context, I’ve taken some personality tests and I’m an ENFJ — the type that usually feels deeply, cares deeply. But I don’t recognize that part of myself anymore.

I just wanted to get this off my chest.

⸻

TL;DR: I’ve been in a 5-year relationship that slowly broke my ability to feel love. After constant reminders of her ex, emotional distance, and feeling unsupported, I’ve become numb — and I miss the person I used to be.",1,1760700018.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

The DLA has extended the deadline for offers several times, moving it from the original date of 29 August to 15 October.

The US Department of Defense has called off a tender for cobalt procurement, underscoring the ongoing challenges Western nations encounter in securing critical minerals.  

In mid-August, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) initially sought offers to procure up to 7,500 tonnes (t) of cobalt over the next five years, under a contract valued at $500m, marking the US Government’s first effort to acquire the metal since 1990, reported [*Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/us-cancels-500-million-cobalt-tender-in-critical-minerals-blow). 

The DLA has extended the deadline for offers several times, moving it from the original date of 29 August to 15 October.  

However, the tender has been withdrawn, marking a setback for US efforts to replenish its critical-mineral reserves following decades of deadlines.  

A notice on a US Government website stated: “There are outstanding issues with the Statement of Work that need resolution before offers may be solicited.”

Enhancing the supply chains for metals such as cobalt has become a political priority for the US and other Western countries, which are aiming to reduce their dependence on China.  

Cobalt is essential for rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs), and has applications in magnets, military systems, munitions and jet engines.  

Beijing has established a stronghold in cobalt processing and amassed a considerable state reserve. 

The US tender followed a rally in cobalt prices due to export controls by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which produces around three-quarters of the global cobalt output.  

The nation recently [replaced a full ban on shipments](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/congo-to-lift-cobalt-export-ban-and-launch-quotas/?utm_source=&utm_medium=19-696613&utm_campaign=) with a quota system.  

Since the export suspension was imposed in February, benchmark prices have doubled. 

Prior to this, cobalt prices had fallen below $10 per pound, a threshold not crossed in 21 years, except for a short decline in late 2015, as reported by *Fastmarkets*. 

The DLA sought offers for alloy-grade cobalt from three producers: Vale in Canada, Sumitomo Metal Mining in Japan and Glencore’s Nikkelverk plant in Norway.  

Suppliers were asked to propose fixed prices over five years, with one amendment excluding a brand from Vale.  

The US Government initially planned to allocate between $2m and $500m for the contract.

A lobbying boom is underway in the U.S. capital, fueled by the government’s strategic push to build up the domestic critical minerals supply chain and break China’s dominance. At least a dozen companies in lithium, copper, rare earths, and geothermal sectors have hired influential lobbying firms this year to secure federal investments, streamline project approvals, and lock in long-term purchase agreements, according to a Reuters review of public records and interviews with industry executives and officials.

The list of lobbyists includes firms with deep political connections, such as Ballard Partners, led by Trump ally Brian Ballard, and The Bernhardt Group, founded by former Interior Secretary David Bernnhardt. Mining giant BHP’s subsidiary, BHP Minerals Service, last month retained Bernhardt’s group to lobby on critical minerals trade issues.  
Ali Haji, CEO of American Tungsten Corp. ([CSE: TUNG](https://nai500.com/zh-hans/%e8%82%a1%e7%a5%a8%e6%9f%a5%e8%af%a2/?qm_symbol=TUNG%3ACC), OTCQB: DEMRF ), [discussed the company’s latest developments and upcoming plans in an interview for METALS 100](https://nai500.com/blog/2025/08/americas-defense-critical-metals-supply-american-tungsten-corp/). American Tungsten is a Canadian exploration company focused on high-potential tungsten and magnetite assets in North America. The company has joined the U.S. Defense Industrial Base Consortium to support the defense sector and has completed an oversubscribed financing of CAD $7 million, demonstrating strong market confidence in its critical metals strategy.

This intense corporate outreach coincides with a significant strategic shift by the White House. It is moving beyond traditional subsidies towards taking direct equity stakes in companies, aiming to counter China’s established global leadership. China’s dominance is built not only on rich natural resources but also on a formidable foundation of advanced smelting technology and a complete, integrated supply chain. The country is now refining its governance of this chain, profoundly impacting global supply dynamics.

This policy pivot has electrified financial markets. The Sprott Lithium Miners ETF has surged more than 35% over the past month. After the government started deploying money this year, every U.S. mineral company board is now thinking about how to get a piece of it, said Ken Hoffman, a commodity strategist at Red Cloud Securities.

While private capital, such as a recent multi-billion dollar commitment from JPMorgan, is flowing in, government funding remains crucial. Private investors often remain wary of junior mining firms and emerging processing technologies.

The lobbying efforts are already yielding tangible results:

* **Lithium Americas (TSX: LAC)**, which hired Guidepost Strategies in July, recently secured a $226 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy and entered an agreement involving a 5% equity swap. Tim Crowley, the company’s VP of Government Affairs, stated they have consistently highlighted the strategic value of their Thacker Pass project to Congress and the White House.
* **Critical Metals** began negotiations with the White House for a potential equity investment in its Greenland rare earths deposit after hiring Cornerstone Government Affairs in February. Chairman Tony Sage emphasized the need to get the project “in front of the U.S. decision-makers.”
* **United States Antimony**, which hired Cassidy & Associates last November, was recently awarded a $245 million contract from the Defense Logistics Agency. Its CEO, Gary Evans, candidly admitted that lobbying was essential to gain visibility: “Some people didn’t even know we existed.”

In this complex arena intersecting geopolitics, trade, and advanced technology, lobbyists often position themselves as “educators” for the 535 members of Congress and the executive branch. As the administration advances new policies, including on seabed mining, the corporate race to secure a position in this strategic sector is intensifying.

“This is a critical time for the industry and government to be working together,” said Matthew Hornor, CEO of Falcon. A battle for influence, central to the energy transition and national security, is quietly reshaping the power structure within America’s minerals industry.

# Oct. 16th, 2025~US-China rare Earth minerals fight explained

China's new rules, which apply to all countries, will be implemented in phases.

[US-China rare Earth minerals fight explained - ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-china-rare-earth-minerals-fight-explained/story?id=126549733)

https://preview.redd.it/egh229cz8nvf1.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=7224f09f34c784db34bb1e28a24b14f4b14d4089

Just weeks before the planned meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, China dramatically expanded its restrictions on rare earth minerals, a move the Trump administration sees as a sharp escalation in China's efforts to tighten its grip on global manufacturing.

China's new rules, which apply to all countries, are set to take effect in phases on Nov. 8, then Dec. 1.

""It is an exercise in economic coercion on every country in the world,"" Ambassador Jameison Greer said Wednesday during a press conference alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. ""This will give China control over basically the entire global economy and the technology supply chain.""

The move prompted Trump to threaten [100% tariffs on all products from China](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-threatens-massive-tariffs-china-triggering-stock-market/story?id=126405187) starting Nov 1st. So far, Beijing hasn't shown any public indication that it's pulling back on its controls, but Bessent remains sanguine.  

 ""I am optimistic that this can be de-escalated. Ultimately, we are confident in the strong relationship between President Trump and President Xi,"" Secretary Bessent said. "" We've had substantial communication with the Chinese over the past few days, and we believe that there will be more forthcoming this week.""

[Some experts](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains) say Beijing is playing hardball to increase its leverage in these upcoming talks, while undercutting U.S. efforts to boost its industrial base.

Bessent said Wednesday that Trump is still expected to meet with Xi in South Korea despite the tariff threats.

The Chinese government stated on Sunday that it does not want a trade war, but it will also not shy away from it.

""On the tariff issue, China’s position remains consistent: we do not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of one,"" China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Sunday. ""If the U.S. persists in its course, China will resolutely take appropriate countermeasures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.""

China's move to restrict rare Earth minerals could have global implications.

The restrictions affect a wide swath of the U.S. and global economy. Rare earths are key to producing computer chips, which are needed for many things like smartphones and AI systems. They're also critical to making magnets to power drones, robots and cars. Rare earths are also crucial for [defense technology](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.csis.org%2Fanalysis%2Fchinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains&data=05%7C02%7CWilliam.M.Mansell%40abc.com%7Ca769c299c50349c542f508de0bfbd0c1%7C56b731a8a2ac4c32bf6b616810e913c6%7C1%7C0%7C638961373659580242%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=4lkniwcW06068uQ1cPrui%2FP8lLFTdbFPScFlABLpDZY%3D&reserved=0), including F-35 fighter jets, Tomahawk missiles, and radar systems.

The restrictions mean that foreign firms must obtain Chinese government approval to export products that have even trace amounts of certain rare earths that originate from China.

Given that China is overwhelmingly dominant in this sector, [this could have major national security implications](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains).

Ambassador Greer gave an example on Wednesday, saying that ""if a car is built in America and sold in Mexico, you would need to seek approval from China before making a sale because of the chips in the car.""

The broad scope of this rule from China is similar to how the U.S. has implemented export restrictions to control chip production around the world that uses American technology.

**The sweeping new restrictions are a sign, some analysts say, that China wants the U.S. to roll back its own export controls, and that this fight is about more than just tariffs.**

# RECAP ~Oct. 16, 2025~NioCorp Reports Assay Results from First Complete Diamond Drill Hole from Drilling Program

[NioCorp Reports Assay Results from First Complete Diamond Drill Hole from Drilling Program | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-reports-assay-results-from-first-complete-diamond-drill-hole-from-drilling-program/)

CENTENNIAL, Colo. (October 16, 2025) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“**NioCorp**” or the “**Company**”) (**NASDAQ:NB**), a leading U.S. critical minerals developer, is pleased to report assay results from the first completed diamond drill hole from its drilling program at its critical minerals project in Southeast Nebraska (the “**Elk Creek Project**”).

The drilling program and associated technical work is being funded by the Pentagon and is designed to support the conversion of a portion of the Elk Creek Project’s Indicated Mineral Resources into Measured Mineral Resources and the subsequent conversion of a portion of its Probable Mineral Reserves into Proven Mineral Reserves. The drilling program was designed to help meet Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve classification requirements associated with the ongoing review of the Company’s application for up to $800 million in potential debt financing by the Export-Import Bank of the United States (“**EXIM Bank**”).

Assays of the other completed drill holes during the now complete drilling program are underway at external laboratories.

“We appreciate the Pentagon’s continued partnership in advancing this important work,” said Mark A. Smith, CEO and Chairman of NioCorp. “These results are consistent with the existing Mineral Resource model for the Elk Creek deposit along with the lithologies logged by the field geology team when the hole was drilled, and confirm that the deposit is well understood. We look forward to receiving the remaining assay results, completing updates to our Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and continuing our discussions with EXIM Bank as we work to advance financing efforts for the Elk Creek Project.”

The drilling program was divided into two phases. Phase I of the program comprised 11 HQ diamond drill holes totaling approximately 7338.5 meters, of which 731.67 meters were drilled in connection with the first drill hole (NEC25-024), with Phase II including four HQ holes totaling approximately 2,235 meters. Two additional geomechanical drill holes totaling approximately 1,950 meters were also completed as part of an accelerated effort to to support underground mine design related to access ramp development.

**Sampling, Analytical Methods and QA/QC Protocols**

All drilling was completed using a Boart Longyear LF160 diamond drill rig with HQ size core. Drill core samples from Phase I of the program were shipped to SGS Analytical’s preparation facility in Denver, Colorado for standard sample preparation which includes weighing, drying, crush (< 4 kg) up to 75% passing 2 mm, riffle split (250 g) and pulverize (Cr steel) to 90% passing 75 µm. The samples were subsequently analyzed using GE-ICM91A50 (sodium peroxide fusion with subsequent analysis by ICP and ICP/MS), GO\_XRF72+GC\_XRF76V (Nb₂O₅ and Ta2O5). The drill core was saw-cut into half-core with one half being sent for geochemical analysis and the other half-core remaining in the core box onsite. A quality assurance/quality control (“**QA/QC**”) protocol was incorporated into the drilling program and included the insertion of certified reference material, silica blanks, duplicate quarters, pulps and rejects all at a rate of approximately 5% respectively.

[MORE CORE = MORE ORE!](https://reddit.com/link/1o8yj31/video/v9hxwikgnnvf1/player)

# What this means — quick interpretation

1. **Robust multi-commodity tenor:** NEC25-024 shows materially elevated values across the four headline metals — niobium, scandium, titanium and rare-earths (TREO). The weighted TREO (\~2,876 ppm) and Niobium (0.74% Nb₂O₅) across \~165 m is a very strong STEM result for a single hole and supports the “More Core = More Ore” readout.
2. **High-value windows:** The combination of long intercepts and higher-grade pods (e.g., 42 m @ 1.33% Nb₂O₅ and multiple >2,000 ppm TREO intervals) is exactly the sort of data that can materially lift resource classification and tonnage when translated into the resource model.
3. **Scandium profile:** A length-weighted scandium of \~71 ppm is notable — coupled with the announced DoD demo/Sc-Al pathway, these numbers materially improve downstream alloy economics (higher feed grade → lower processing cost per kg Sc).
4. **Immediate implication for the 2025 program:** If these assays are representative across additional infill/step-out holes (the 9 infill + 6 step-outs), they reinforce the possibility of a meaningful TREO uplift toward a potential\~1 Mt TREO scenario. That, in turn, strengthens DFS inputs (NPV, payback, multiproduct crediting) and the off-take / financing narrative.

# ✅ Positioned at the center of the U.S. Critical Minerals strategy, NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project offers:

* Multiple **Top 10 USGS-listed minerals**
* Supply chain independence from China
* Vertical integration across mining, advanced processing, and **future recycling**
* Alignment with the **MCS (Multilateral Commercial Stockpile)**, **DoD offtakes**, **EXIM funding**, and the new SMR Critical Minerals Hub

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# ⚔️ NIOCORP — “A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW!”

📅 **Friday, Oct 17, 2025 — The Calm Before Phase II Ignition**

The first drill-core result from Niocorp’s 2025 campaign just landed — and it’s exactly what the market needed to confirm the trend: **consistent high-grade niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs across multiple intercepts**, including a 42 m stretch at 1.33% Nb₂O₅ and nearly 3,000 ppm TREO. ***This is not a one-off — it’s the opening salvo in what could be a resource re-rating sequence for the entire Elk Creek system!***

Yes, the stock closed at **$8.30** yesterday on **17.4M shares traded**, but that follows over **100M shares of total turnover** earlier this week — nearly the entire float — most of it above $9–$10. This is not panic selling; it’s controlled reallocation. The float is cleansed, the weak hands are gone, and the setup is textbook for an institutional coil before the next major catalyst drop.

🚨 **The Catalysts Now in Play:**

* 🧭 \*\*\***Next Drill Hole — Any Time Now:** The company hinted multiple assays are in queue. “More Core = More Ore!” isn’t hype — it’s a countdown.
* 🧱 **$150M Financing & S-3ASR Active:** Overhang removed; capital firepower secured for EXIM, DFC, or DoD co-investment.
* 🧬 \*\*\***Scandium-Aluminum Defense Prime Reveal — November:** First U.S.-sourced Scandium metal in a century, tied to defense partners.
* 📊 **Final Q4 DFS Update:** RailVeyor efficiency and extended mine life expected → boosts NPV and project economics.
* 🏛 **Three Major Investor Events:**
   * **Maxim Growth Summit – Oct 22–23 (NYC)**
   * **RedChip Emerging Growth Conference – Oct 27 (Virtual)**
   * **ThinkEquity Conference – Oct 30 (NYC, Live Stream)** → These back-to-back appearances confirm management confidence. You don’t line up three national stages if your drill data disappoints.

**The next hole can drop at any time**, and when it does, the market will realize yesterday’s assay was just a **shot across the bow!** — **a warning that Elk Creek’s scale may be far larger than anyone modeled in 2022.**

The first drill hole was a teaser, not the full assay set. **The next hole (“the golden core”) could drop anytime, and that’s the real ignition trigger.** Until then, algos exploit the gap for shakeouts and liquidity harvesting.

💡 **Bottom Line:**  
Wall Street is resting, not retreating. Washington is watching.  
The float is clean, the overhang is gone, and the catalysts are locked in sequence.  
**The next drill core is the spark — and when it hits, the re-rating begins.**

As **Wall Street capital** and **Washington policy** finally converge, **NioCorp** is fully stepping into its role as a **U.S. National Security Asset** in the making!

Until now, I used an old Bialetti 3-cup aluminium moka pot, that I would chuck it onto the hob at full power, wait until it bubbled hard, and enjoyed my coffee. I just bought an Alessi 9090 pot.

Current gear and material:

* Moka pot: new Alessi 9090 3-cup stainless steel
* Grinder: Commandante C40
* Heating: ceramic hob with power increments between 1/9 and 9/9. Modulates heat by switching On & Off at various intervals (rather than continuously), which is probably not ideal
* Coffee: medium roast beans in from a 1kg unopened bag I had laying around at room temperature in a kitchen cupboard (best before 26/01/2025 -> might explain the strong acidity I get)

Initial parameters:

* water: 12°C from the tap (measured temperature)
* hob power: 7/9 from cold initial state
* Coffee: 14g, ground at 13 clicks settings on the C40 (on the finer side of the ""Bialetti"" recommended range from the instruction manual), full basket, levelled, non tamped

1st brew observations and related timings (in min'sec) when brewing:

* 0'00 -> 4'32: complete silence (no pre-simmer, hiss, gurgle) and nothing visible in the top chamber (no first dark drops in the upper chamber)
* 4'32 -> 5'11: no ""first-drip"", goes from nothing to immediately sustained liquid flow all around and along down the column in the upper chamber
* 5'11 -> 5'20: bubbling then straight to strong irregular bubbling
* 5'20 -> 5'35: take it off the heat, 10s base rince under cold water to kill tail extraction, end of brewing

Aftermath:

* Coffee aspect and taste: Zero crema, taste predictably awfully acidic, definitively not ""round"" (no body, feels watery), no sweetness, not bitter
* Residual water in the pot base: 30mL water (which seems a lot)

What are the take-aways of this test process? (appart from the obvious ""buy better freaking coffee"") Is a 40s extraction okay? -> seems a low, promoting initial acids extractions but not the sugars and oils how do I know if my brewing temperature is at the right level?

ChatGPT tells me that my moka pot never builds enough sustained pressure to drive out the last 20\~25% of boiler water. The pot is new, unless there's a manufacturing defect there shouldn't be any pressure leaking.

1o8yeje,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contrave/comments/1o8yeje/my_experience_2_months_in/,My experience 2 months in,"55 yr old female, SW 225, CW 208
I'm down 17 pounds in 2 months. I have slowly titrated up when I felt I needed to. I am currently on 2 in morning and 1 later in the day. I'm losing between 1-2 pounds a week. At the beginning I lost more than that in the first few weeks but have leveled out now.
I generally have a bowl of cereal or an omelet for breakfast and then take my Contrave an hour or so later. I take my second pill mid-afternoon with a small snack. I drink fluids all day long, lots of fluids.
I have experienced no nausea, very mild headaches, and occasional constipation relieved by more fiber or cups of coffee. A few times I have taken Miralax to help things along. Dry mouth happens if I'm not drinking fluids regularly all day long.

Contrave is definitely helping with weight loss as it turns down the food noise dramatically. I know I would enjoy a cupcake, but there is no crazy drive to make, purchase, or eat cupcakes. No drive to check out the fridge or pantry. A few times I have found myself eating more when I just meant to get a small snack, but the Contrave makes me so much more attuned to feeling full that even a bigger snack that I planned on is considerably smaller than the one I would have had in the past. I just feel satisfied much earlier than before Contrave.

Other than weight loss and reduced food noise, Contrave has benefited me in other various ways. My anxiety and self-consciousness has greatly diminished. I'm less reactive and more relaxed. Just generally happier and more peaceful. My sleep is awesome. I do have the vivid dreams and they are very interesting! 

I am so happy I decided to try Contrave. I imagine this is how ""normal"" people feel all the time. I was always impressed when someone passed on dessert and thought they had so much willpower. Now I realize that dessert is an easy thing to forego without feeling at all deprived because it just doesn't interest me much anymore. 

I was anxious about starting and read many posts to gain insight into other's experience, so I thought it only right to share mine for those wanting the same insight.

The definitive way to ensure that Saiki's coffee jelly is always safe.

By doubling the space-time of coffee jellies, they are always out of reach of anyone who wants to grab them. No matter how fast you are, you will never be able to overcome that distance. If something appears directly on top of the jelly, one of Kusuke's inventions, it won't matter because the coffee jellies will always be 2 seconds out of time.

I like the feeling the day or two after quitting cold turkey. In the past I've eaten(?) weed simply to get over with the high and then enjoy the withdrawal, and same with coffee. It's the lack of dopamine that does something for me, I wouldn't say it's 'motivating' but it just feels cozy and I instantly begin to recognise and enforce my own boundaries more and focus on doing stuff that I actually enjoy. 

Admittedly it also puts me into a mild depressive mood, but it's not sad-sadness, more like a melancholic, almost nostalgic, appreciative feeling. As if I know I'm going to die, but at least I can smell the flowers. 

I promise im not trying to be special or something on this sub by being a freak in this sense, but does anyone else experience the same thing? And if anyone is smarter than me, could possibly provide an explanation or theory as to why?",6,1760699160.0,decaf,2,1.0,False
1o8ybeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1o8ybeb/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_1/,There’s Something Under The Boardwalk [Part 1],"
If you’re reading this, it’s because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It’s only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it’s hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We’re barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it’s already a ghost town. That’s where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

“Spectre’s: Records & Rarities”; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn’t be able to name a single song off the album they’re donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I’d never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I’m not going to play them, who will?

Tonight’s choice: “Secret Treaties” by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew “Don’t Fear the Reaper” — who doesn’t? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70’s. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of “Career of Evil” blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn’t have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled “Harvester of Eyes” certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn’t care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn’t have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old “Plan 9 From Outer Space” poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn’t nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody’s grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it’s so full of life that it’s overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that’s why I never left. If I don’t visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn’t want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent’s Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

“Oh my god! You scared me!” she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. “I’m sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.”

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

“Sure, sure. Three bucks.”

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. “So, any plans tonight?”

I thought about it, and I really didn’t have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick’s for a drink or two until I’ve had enough to put me to sleep.

“I was going to head over to Mick’s, maybe catch the game for a bit.”

She grinned. “I know Mick’s — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I’ll stop by. There isn’t much else to do on a night like tonight.”

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

“Maybe I’ll see you there,” I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

“Hey bud, I haven’t seen you in a while.”

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. “Hey Mac, long time.”

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. “It’s been dead out here, huh?”

Without looking up, he lamented, “Sure has. It’s that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.”

Puzzled, I pressed him. “What do you mean?”

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. “I need to get some help. I’m going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.”

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn’t have been happier.

“That’s great, man! I’d give you a ride myself if I had a car.”

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. “I just need to see her again.”

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

“I haven’t really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and… everything just started falling apart…” he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, “I’m just ready. Tonight’s my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.”

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn’t know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. “Vincent’s was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I’ll see you, I won’t take no for an answer.”

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

“That’s really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.”

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. “I really think what you’re doing is great. It’s been nice knowing you.”

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. “You too. I’d say I’ll see you again, but I really hope it’s not here.”

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

“Hey, what’s your real name, by the way? Maybe I’ll look you up someday to see how you’re doing.”

Without turning fully around, he said, “It doesn’t really matter.”

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick’s resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick’s served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick’s was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick’s was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp’s nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn’t a wasp’s nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was… breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn’t very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn’t help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

1o8y9vo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING/comments/1o8y9vo/nothing_headphones_1_an_heaphone_odyssey_with/,Nothing Headphones (1) - An Heaphone Odyssey with HappyEnd and Feedback,"Hi everyone,

I’m completely new to the Nothing universe, but I’ve always looked at the Nothing Phones with envy. They just look way too good compared to my Pixel phones. Still, I never bought one... but that’s not what this post is about.

I’m a huge fan of over-ear headphones and have tried many brands out there, the latest are: Teufel, Sennheiser, Anker, Beyerdynamic, Sony, and now, finally, Nothing.

And I just have to say: I’m blown away.

What you get here for the price of good mid-range headphones is simply more than I expected.

All the things that matter to me in headphones were fulfilled by the Nothing Headphones (1), except for one small flaw and one wish.

And I’m not writing this for likes or to badmouth other brands (I really like most of them). I just want to help people who are going through the same headphone odyssey as I did and maybe give Nothing some feedback they can use to improve things even further.

My personal criteria:

\- Large, soft earcups (I get headaches quickly from pressure or ear contact)

\- Rich sound and enough bass to really feel techno tracks

\- Easy Bluetooth switching between devices (I use them with my phone and laptop)

\- A comfortable headband - I’m bald, so pressure points on the scalp are an issue

\- A design that stands out (since I can’t do that with my hair, at least let me do it with my headgear, lol)

\- Good noise cancelling for open office spaces

\- Simple controls, no fiddly gestures

\- Subtle sound feedback for settings changes (ideally opt-out)

\- Sturdy build - my big head tends to destroy weak joints

\- Good call quality, so I can make coffee while talking without deafening the other person

Headphones I compared:

\-Sennheiser Momentum 4

\-Teufel Massive

\-Teufel Real Blue

\-Sony XM5

\-Beyerdynamic AVENTHO 300

\-Nothing Headphones (1)

Quick summary:

Teufel and Beyerdynamic probably have the best hardware build quality, with Beyerdynamic being on another level entirely. Unfortunately, the software is terrible... with the Beyers, even wiping a table with a dry cloth made my conversation partner hear everything, the equalizer wont work properly and Bluetooth pairing was also a nightmare.

Sennheiser checked most boxes “okay-ish,” but since I was coming from the Sony XM5, those were simply better in every way.

Sony XM5:  
The software is brilliant (that “find your EQ” feature is premium). The sound is super balanced, and the call quality is the best of all I tested. The earcups are extremely comfortable, but the headband can be painful on a bald head over time. The plastic build is also very fragile - my big skull eventually cracked one of the joints after 3 years.

And then came Nothing:  
Wow. They basically nailed everything I wanted! except for one thing...

Comfortable, large earcups - check

Deep, rich sound with plenty of bass - check

Easy Bluetooth switching - check (you can even connect to two devices at once! I didn’t even know that was possible!)

Unique design - check obviously, it’s Nothing

Excellent noise cancelling - check even better than the XM5

Simple, intuitive controls - check best of all compared

Subtle sound feedback - check I hate ASMR, but this is actually great. No beeps or chimes, just a soft whisper.

Sturdy build - checkno weak points spotted so far

Call quality - and here’s the one flaw: background noise is filtered out nicely, and I can finally clean while on calls, but my voice sounds distant, like I’m on speakerphone. Hopefully, a firmware patch can fix this.

My one wish:  
Something like aftermarket headband pads. Something to better distribute the weight of these slightly heavy headphones. Sadly, those are hard to find nowadays. I made one myself for my Sonys after a repair, and that made them my favorite headphones for another six months.

Maybe someone here knows of a good option, or maybe Nothing will read this and think, “Hey, that would be a cool add-on we could sell.”

Anyway, that’s all from me.

Just wanted to share my feedback, curious to see if it resonates with anyone.

Have a great weekend, everyone!

sincerely your Spiddek (even if nobody knows me)

After Shave – Alum, Nemo Shaving’s Afghan ASL



I was in a bit hurry today but wanted a clean look so opted for Pearl Hammer paired with Gillette PermaSharp.



No pre shave routine. Just scooped out soap into Yaqi Bowl and lathered with Mystersious Space. I scooped out a lot of soap today but lather quality was pretty good. Kept on adding water to the bowl and to my face and had enough lather for 3 passes.



First pass wtg went amazingly smooth. Actually I didn’t require any further passes. But just went overboard and lathered up for second pass. XTG on cheeks and atg on neck. Second pass also went well.



Had a substantial alum feedback on neck area. Closed the Shave with Nemo Shaving’s Afghan ASL. Had some irritation on neck area where I did some buffing, thats my trouble spot and I have spiral hair growth in that area. But it subsided within 5-10 mins after applying the ASL.



Overall a very satisfactory shave. I would have used the blade for more shaves, but the wrapper was all wet, so I just tossed into my blade bin. May be next time I will be careful to keep the wrapper dry.",5,1760698917.0,Wetshavers_India,1,1.0,False

I (19F) live with my parents and my little brother (15M). Both his friends and my friends often come to our house. I actually hate when my brother brings his friends because they are very loud, disrespectful and unhygienic. They most of the time play sports together before coming to our house and they come all dirty and sweaty without chaging their clothes. The worst thing is that they don't even change their socks so there is always this horrible foot smell when they come.

My friends also often come to our house (all girls). And they don't behave like my brother's friends at all. They are polite and very clean. They are the exact opposite of my brother's friends. Sometimes we go to our yoga class with my friends and come to our class afterwards but of course we don't get sweaty and dirty like my brother and his friends when they play basketball or other sports.

The other day two of my friends came to our house. Since they were both wearing sandals, they went barefoot inside. Actually they always go barefoot inside our house without wearing slippers. So we were sitting in our living room with my friends. We felt quite cold at one point and my friends placed their feet on the coffee table in the living room because their feet were cold (and also one of them's feet were hurting since she wear wearing high heel sandals). 

In the evening, my parents told me they saw my friends placing their feet on our furniture, their behavior was unacceptable and I should warn them if I want to keep inviting them. It got me very angry and frustrated since they never say anything about my brother's friends behavior but were upset that my friends placed their feet on our coffee table because they were cold.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Houston Cougars vs. Arizona Wildcats: A Tale of Turnarounds, Turnovers, and Turbulent Hope**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of college football’s emotional rollercoasters! The Houston Cougars (5-1) and Arizona Wildcats (4-2) meet in a rematch that’s less “Thriller” and more “Therapy Session.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a drunk uncle at a family reunion.

---

### The Odds: A Toss-Up, But Not a Toss-Down

The betting lines are as tight as a deflated balloon. Houston is a slight favorite (-1.5) at most books, with decimal odds hovering around **1.93-1.95** (implying a 51-52% chance to win). Arizona checks in at **1.87-1.91** (53-55%), suggesting bookmakers see this as a near-50/50 battle. The total is set at **47.5 points**, meaning Vegas thinks this will be a moderate-scoring affair—neither a fireworks show nor a nap-inducing snoozer.

For context: If you bet $100 on Houston at -1.5, you’d need them to win by *at least two points* to avoid looking at your losses like a rejected love letter. Arizona’s +1.5 line is a lifeline for a team that’s gone from “bowl-eligible hopeful” to “praying to a statue of Lady Luck.”

---

### The News: Injuries, Superstitions, and the Ghost of Turnovers Past

**Houston’s Story:** The Cougars have transformed from 4-8 also-rans to 5-1 contenders, thanks to transfer QB Conner Weigman (think: a toaster that suddenly learned to brew coffee) and RB Dean Connors. Their previous loss to Arizona? A three-turnover disaster that makes a toddler’s cookie-dropping spree look professional. They converted just 2/13 third downs—about the efficiency of a broke person trying to haggle at a luxury car dealership.

**Arizona’s Story:** The Wildcats are playing with the desperation of a gambler who just lost their last $20. They need *two* wins in six games to reach a bowl, and this Houston game is their “get it over with” moment. Coach Brent Brennan is reviving the “Sandstorm” jerseys—a nod to their 41-13 win over Oklahoma State in 2022. Le

At the heart of the project is a specially developed connection system, inspired by LEGO Technic. Four different pins allow for a wide variety of configurations while ensuring stability. **Pin 01** and **Pin 02** differ only by a limiting ring, **Pin 03**is used to attach sheet materials, and **Pin 04** functions as a safety element that prevents unintentional release while stabilizing angles. The entire set of turned pins was produced by [**JLCCNC**](https://jlccnc.com/)**.** The system can be easily assembled and disassembled using two custom-designed tools.

This process is powered by a **Grasshopper script built in Rhino**, which enables the automatic conversion of the user’s line drawings into the precise connection system — bridging the gap between digital input and physical construction. The foundation of the concept is a grid in the X, Y, and Z directions. This ensures that all designed furniture pieces remain compatible with one another. For example, a shelf, table, and sideboard can be combined into a single unit. By using multiples of the grid—such as 10, 20, or 40 units—different modules can also be combined seamlessly. A digital configurator, embedded in a website, makes the design process intuitive and accessible. Users can draw lines within the grid, which are automatically translated into the connection system and exported as 3D data. In addition to the drawing area, the platform features a personal workspace, a public library of designs, and detailed instructions for using the system.

This creates an open infrastructure that empowers both designers and non-designers to create and share their own furniture. *To Brick or Not To Brick* is therefore more than just a furniture project—it is a platform for participatory design. By combining digital tools with physical production, it allows for individualization and adaptability while making design a democratic process. In doing so, it aligns with the open-source movement and demonstrates how design can become more collaborative, flexible, and accessible in the future. To demonstrate the system, a set of office furniture was developed based on the 15×15 cm and 30×30 cm grids. The collection includes a desk, shelf, sideboard, coffee table, armchair, simple chair, floor lamp, and desk lamp. Each piece can be used individually or combined modularly. Unused holes serve as connection points but can also be repurposed for custom extensions such as handles, hooks, or power outlets. As a physical prototype, a chair and a desk lamp were realized, both of which can stand alone or function together

A new day dawned on Planet Nemesis. The sun’s rays revealed grey metal fortresses covering the surface like a suit of armor. They were the cities that the natives inhabited, made especially for deterring invasion. The zenith of the union of scientific advancement and military might, but a chill ran through the land. As if the world’s spirit went cold, grieving, seeing its protective shell as a prison forged from a Faustian bargain.

A castle several hundred meters high stood at the center of the fortress cities, Dark Colossus. Mavor's stronghold cast a long shadow over the land for miles. It stood as an extension of him, a symbol of power, a constant reminder of his dominance. Inside, Morana and Cymbeline hurried through the halls to meet their master. As they neared the emperor, the couple stood before the doors to his throne room, giving each other worried glances. Still, they finally ventured forward, holding hands tightly. 

As they entered Mavor’s chamber, they saw him sitting on his throne, judging them with his gaze as Evelyn stood beside him. Quickly bowed down on their knees. Mavor sat across from them by several inches. Inside light gently poured in through the set of five stained glass windows on the left, each one being one hundred and seventy-two inches tall, drawing elongated shadows across the room.

""I hope you both realize the severity of this matter. Planet Aqua would have made a valuable strategic asset,"" Mavor said.

""We understand, sir,"" Morana said.

""Emperor, please be lenient with Morana. It was my poor tactical decisions that cost us the victory.""

Mavor took a deep breath, rising from his throne, and walked to Morana and Cymbeline. The sound of his footsteps echoed through the room, visibly tensing their backs as he got closer.

""Rise, both of you.""

The two quickly stood up.

""W-what is our punishment, Emperor?"" Morana asked.

""No punishment.""

""Really?""

""Yes. But you, Morana, are to go on leave until informed otherwise.""

""Yes, sir.""

""And Cymbeline, resume your post over the colony worlds. The war grows more costly each day. But the resources from the lesser beings should aid us.""

""Of course, Emperor.""

""Now begone.""

Morana and Cymbeline swiftly left the room. As his two servants were gone, Mavor walked back to his throne. He dropped onto his seat, running his hand over his face.

""This Damara is proving to be a mightier challenge than I expected. I was certain Cymbeline and Morana, working together, would conquer her.""

""Emperor Mavor, sir. Please let me handle Damara. Focus on the wider war effort,"" Evelyn said.

""No. I have a different task for you. And with our plans in motion, I suspect you don't have long to prepare.""

“And this is your final word, sir?”

Mavor answered Evelyn with silence, looking at her.

“I understand, Emperor.”

\*\*\*

On Earth, Belle jogged toward the Lily Boutique. She took her keys from her purse, ready to go to work. But as she inched towards the door, her face turned pale, seeing the reflection of a monstrous being in the glass.

*""My god,""* Belle shouted.

Belle swiftly turned to see the creature walking through the street on all fours. However, more unearthly beasts soon flooded the streets. They came in many shapes and sizes, walking on fours, twos, or flapping on wings. The creatures’ means of communication were just as varied. Belle’s ears were bombarded by roars, bird-like chirping, the most irritating screeches, and more.

Belle's heart pounded harder and harder, seeing each one, and she quickly opened the door, diving into the boutique. She hid in a corner, taking sewing shears as a weapon, trembling.

*""Heavenly Father, please protect me.""*

Belle stopped trembling as her body stiffened, hearing footsteps at the door. The steps grew louder as they approached her, and she readied her weapon. Seeing a shadow bear down on her, Belle sprang from the corner, stabbing at her adversary. However, she caught it as the shears neared her heart, revealing Belle's enemy was her sister.

*""Daisy,""* Belle said with an exasperated gasp.

""Big sister, what are you doing?” Daisy pulled the shears away from Belle’s hand. “Why did you try to stab me?""

""Sissy, something terrible has happened. An army of unholy demons has invaded the city.""

""Demons? D-do you mean all the creatures walking outside?""

Belle anxiously nodded.

""Belle, those aren't demons. They're refugees.""

""What?""

""Don't you remember? We were expecting our first batch around this time.""

""No. Why didn't anyone tell me?""

""We thought you knew. It's been all over the news.""

Belle hastily hugged Daisy for dear life, crying a sea as snop dripped from her nose.

\*\*\*

Belle fearfully gazed out a window, watching the off-worlders traverse the streets. Her eyes were red and ringed with sizable bags as she tracked their movements. But sharing sideways glances, Daisy and Aisha went to their sister, pulling her away.

""Chief, are you going to be okay?"" Aisha asked.

""I honestly don't know.""

""Big sister, just remember. They're ordinary people like you and me. Husbands, wives, and children, trying to lead happy lives.""

""But half of them could kill me if they sneeze the wrong way.""

""Belle, many of them came here because this was the first planet Damara saved. They want to feel safe for once in their lives,"" Daisy said.

*""Let go of me.""* Belle broke away from her sisters, dropping into a chair, and rubbing her temples.

""Daisy, have any humans gone off-world yet, besides military personnel?"" Clive asked.

""Some of our neighbors are journeying to Ulew. The world of vast tropical islands.

""Really?” Clive rubbed his chin, sprouting a smile. “Maybe me and a special someone should take a visit there.""

Carter walked over to a window. ""Speaking of traveling, it looks like we have new neighbors. Someone's moving into the Simonson place.""

Daisy and the others hurried to the window, seeing a moving truck stop by the building across the street. Their eyes widened, looking at the workers unloading glowing plants and other objects.

""I-I can't believe it. Mr. and Mrs Simonson sold their property to an off-worlder,"" Aisha said.

""God help us,"" Belle said.

""Belle, stop it."" Daisy walked to the door, opening it with a smile. ""I'm going to welcome our new neighbors. Who wants in?""

Everyone came to Daisy except Belle.

""You're not coming, big sister?""

""I'm getting started on work. Have fun.""

Belle left the others, walking to her sewing machine. Daisy bellowed a deep sigh but still left, leading the group across the street to the Simonson building.

\*\*\*

Daisy and the others entered the old Simonson building. Inside was a repository of generations past. Pottery, bookshelves, umbrellas of various colors, and more cluttered the space. The blue paint adorning the walls had long since faded with time, revealing the grey wood underneath. And dust particles, accumulated over decades, danced through the air, agitating the eyes and nose. But navigating through the maze of cobwebs flying across the mementos, they scanned the room for the new neighbors.

*""Anybody home?""* Carter shouted.

A tumbling sound, a vase breaking, flashed through the air, and a dust cloud followed. It assaulted the group’s senses, but the new neighbor emerged, clumsily tripping over her legs. She was a reptilian humanoid species with pale blue scaly skin, a Drake. Makiway was a female of thirty with a slender, curvy body, a long tail, and blonde hair in pigtails.

""G-greetings. My name is Makiway Mulvana.""

""It's such a pleasure. My name is Daisy David. These are Carter Buchanan Barnes, Clive Rogers, and Aisha Robinson. We came here to welcome you to the neighborhood.""

""Thank you. You have to meet my daughter.""

""You have a daughter?""

""I'm happy to say I do. Rohan, please come here.""

Rohan hurried from around a corner, a girl of seven, to her mother. ""Yes, Mama.""

Aisha lunged forward at Rohan with her arms outstretched for a hug. ""You are so cute.""

Rohan swiftly dived behind Makiway, hiding.

""I don't want to come off a certain way, but please keep your distance from my daughter. She's still adjusting to the new planet.""

""I understand.” Aisha puffed her cheeks. “I’m Sorry.""

Daisy giggled. ""Makiway, may I ask if you’ll start a business here?""

""I’ll be starting a restaurant. I dare say I was a rather skilled cook on Dragos.""

""Off-worlder food. You think you can make a living selling here?"" Carter asked.

""Isn't it the American way that hard work prevails?""

Daisy scanned the room. ""But where's the rest of your staff?""

""For now, it's just me. I'll endure it until I have enough money to pay for employees.""

A crashing sound raced through the air. The group hurried to its source, seeing a piece of the ceiling collapse.

""Makiway, I think old man Simonson conned you,"" Clive said.

Makiway dropped to her knees, shedding tears. But Daisy ran to her aid, helping her stand.

""Makiway, let us help you. We'll be your staff until you're more stable,"" Daisy said.

""B-but I can't pay you.""

""We'll work for free.""

""That's far too generous. Besides, I want to succeed through hard work.""

""Take this from someone born and raised in Kansas. Helping each other is also a part of the American way.""

Makiway gazed at Rohan, taking a deep breath. ""Fine. For my daughter.""

The group spent the next few hours restoring the old building. Aisha and Makiway vigorously wiped the windows, scrubbing away the years upon years of dust and grime that clung to their surface. As Clive carried the bookcases and other mementos outside, Daisy labored by herself, cleaning the newly opened space of five hundred square feet of floor. And elsewhere, Carter hammered away, repairing the damaged ceiling.

As Makiway wiped the sweat off her forehead, she turned around to dunk her rag in a nearby bucket, rinsing it to continue cleaning the windows. However, as she did, she spotted Daisy with a large smile on her face, laboring in her duties. And what’s more, the floor was still a long way from being clean. Still, the young woman’s smile persisted as the sound of her scrub brush flowed through the room. Making Makiway go to Aisha, tapping her shoulder.

“If I may be so bold Aisha, you and your sister, don’t seem to be strangers to hard labor.”

“Sweetie, you can take the girl out of the farm, but you can’t take the farm out of the girl.”

“I’ll remember that.” Makiway smiled.

Another portion of the ceiling collapsed, undoing Daisy’s hard work as the debris soiled the part of the floor she had cleaned.

Carter pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’ll call the lumber guy.

\*\*\*

In the three weeks that followed, they continued the process. As they labored, gradually, they added tasks like securing ingredients and building a proper kitchen. But finally, the restaurant was ready. Again, in no small part due to generous loans from Carter.

Upon opening day, Linus ran to the Lily boutique, meeting Daisy outside.

""Good morning, Linus.""

""Morning, Daisy. I came to pay for the jacket.""

""Great. But may I interest you in a delicious meal at a fair price?""

""You serve food here now?""

""Not exactly. Let me refer you to our new business partner across the street.""

Daisy pointed to the restaurant, directing Linus to the Mulvana establishment. His eyes widened, seeing the crowd of over a hundred gathered around the building. Carter stood in front of Makiway's restaurant in a black suit, capturing the attention of every female, young and old, and of every color and creed.

""Welcome to the Mulvana restaurant. I'll be a waiter serving today, and the owner is a friend of mine. Who's interested in a table?"" Carter shot the women a flirtatious wink.

Hearing Carter, the women swiftly flooded into the restaurant.

\*\*\*

At sunset, Daisy and the others celebrated a good day's work in the Mulvana restaurant. The adults drank glasses of fine champagne, but young Rohan enjoyed orange juice.

""Thank you all so much. Without your customers, I would be nothing.""

""It was a team effort, Makiway. I lost track of the times someone thanked me for recommending your food,"" Daisy said.

Carter took a bite of Makiway's food off his plate, growing a smile. ""I don't know what to call it, but your food's got it.""

Makiway unleashed a river of tears.

""Mama, what's wrong?” Rohan pulled on Makiway’s clothes. “Why are you crying?""

""Nothing, my love. These are tears of joy.""

""You can cry when you're happy?""

""Rohan, it's rare, but it happens,"" Daisy said.

""Wow.""

Clive raised his glass in the air. ""To Makiway’s success?"" And the others swiftly followed suit, lightly knocking their glasses together.

""Rohan? Rohan?"" Aisha looked at the girl inquisitively.

""Yes, Aisha?"" Makiway asked.

""Well, I don't want to sound rude, but there's something off about her name. It sounds a lot like a boy's to me.""

Makiway laughed. ""That's not surprising. Rohan is a gender-neutral name on Dragos. We named her after her father, my husband.""

""Oh. But where's he?""

Hearing Aisha, Makiway stopped crying. She wiped her tears, making way for a symbol of her true sadness beyond that of mere crying. She sent shivers throughout the room as she grew a frown unlike any other. It was like her face aged several decades in a few seconds.

""The truth is my husband died a long time ago.""

""I'm so sorry. How did it happen?"" Aisha asked.

""It was before Dragos joined the United Planets. The Nemesis attacked our land, and my Rohan was among the casualties.""

A fiery rage rivaling that of the one she felt after Everton's death consumed Daisy as she heard of the injustice Makiway suffered. Learning of Mavor’s atrocities in the war always did something to Daisy that none before, not even Morana, could. He engendered within her passionate hatred. She wanted to shout and scream, cursing his name. But concealing her fury for the sake of her dual identity, she instead took a pencil from her purse, snapping it behind her back.

""I ache for your plight.” Daisy stooped down, looking the young girl in the eye. “Rohan, I know what it's like losing a father, but I promise it gets better.""

""B-but I don't even remember what Papa looks like.""

*""What?""* Daisy shouted.

""It all happened when she was freshly hatched from her egg, barely a few months old.""

Carter took a deep breath. ""Red, why don't we invite these two to dinner?""

""That's a wonderful idea. Won't you, Makiway?""

""I don't know what to say. You've already given us so much.""

""Please, we insist.""

""Well, okay. But I want to treat you to dinner next time."" Makiway forced a smile.

""It's a deal. Thank you.""",1,1760698231.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

As Daisy and Carter saw Clive’s ship meet a fiery crash, Daisy pulled on Flaremane’s reins, guiding him to the vessel.

*""We have to help them,""* Daisy shouted.

*""Delay that,""* Favian said over the communicator.

Daisy stopped Flaremane as she heard Favian.

""General Favian—""

""Damara, this is our last chance. If we don't destroy those generators now, that's it. This whole part of space falls to the enemy."" Favian interrupted.

“But Clive’s team was supposed to attack the third generator.”

“We’ll figure it out later. But now we must hit the other two before it’s too late.”

Daisy looked at the fiery wreckage of the ship with teary eyes. She turned her gaze to Carter, awaiting his response. And he gave it to her with a slow, reluctant nod. 

Daisy sluggishly turned away from aiding her comrades.

""S-sir, yes, sir. We'll destroy our generator quickly and then cover Yara and Lieutenant Rogers.""

\*\*\*

Clive punched open the fiery ship from within at the crash site. As the hull burst, it revealed him with the others barely alive, dragging out as many of their injured comrades as they could. The United Planets soldiers went through the immense heat and the black smoke that attacked their lungs and dashed away from the ship. Clive carried thirty people on his back, Ros had ten, and Yara had five, as the other soldiers followed them to safety.

""I hope we still have some working comms. They need to know we're still alive,"" Clive said.

""Don't bother. Even if we died, it wouldn't affect General Favian. No matter what, Mission first,"" Yara said.

""Wow, this guy sounds like a jerk.""

Yara growled like a feral beast. ""You know, Rogers, I don't think I like you.""

""Well, now the feeling is mutual.""

""Both of you, stop it.” Ros pushed the lieutenants apart from one another. “We're in enemy territory and running low on time.""

A plasma bolt flew at Ros. But as it was about to hit her head, Clive pushed her out of the way. The team quickly spotted the source of the attack. A detachment of Nemesis soldiers was fast approaching. And behind their enemies stood the power generator.

""No matter what, we need to get into that building,"" Yara said.

""Ros, are you okay with this?” Clive put a hand on her shoulder. “I mean, these guys are your people.""

""Of course not, Clive. But it's like what Damara said. We're here to fight for the dream.""

""Alright. Then let you and me put them down quickly and painlessly.""

With a nod from Ros, she and Clive drew their weapons. Alongside her bo-staff, Clive's large mace was ready for battle. With them, the remaining United Planets soldiers prepared to meet their opponents. However, as the two were about to lead the charge, Yara stopped them with a hand to their faces.

""Everybody hold it. I get the first choice of the enemy. It's been too long since I had a good fight.""

In the blink of an eye, Yara closed the distance of several meters between her and the Nemesis. She tore into the enemy with beastly strength and speed, nearly becoming a black-and-white blur. Unleashing a flurry of blows on them, punching, slashing with her claws, and kicking, constantly changing direction faster than they could defend. 

Her comrades watched her battle, unable to turn away from the animalistic savagery and beauty of her combat style. But they soon regained their senses and hurried to join her. Clive and Ros led the charge as they cut through the Nemesis army. The two bashed one enemy after the next as they made their way to the building. Battling with such skill and harmony of movement, it was as if they had been training together for years.

""Wow,"" Ros said.

""Thanks, I—""

Ros threw her bo staff at a Nemesis soldier, sneaking behind Clive. As it stabbed him in the shoulder, Clive looked at her with a smile. But in return, she blushed red.

Together, Clive, Ros, and Yara led the United Planets soldiers, subduing the remaining enemies outside. They smashed into the building, knocking down the doors, meeting more opponents fiercely guarding the generator. Still, Yara rushed into the fray with her claws out. She slashed at the enemy left and right, more beast than a person in the heat of battle. The lieutenant mowed down a dozen enemies in a minute, inching closer to the generator. Suddenly, one of the enemies shot Yara in the shoulder, knocking her unconscious. But before they could finish her, Clive and Ros came over with dire speed. Clive punched out a Nemesis, training his gun on Yara. However, exhaustion and the enemy's superior numbers began to take their toll. 

The Nemesis beat them mercilessly until they were bloody and bruised on the floor. Still, with the last of his strength, Clive resolved to one final action.*""Choke on this.""* He jumped to his feet and tossed his mace at the power generator. And as it flew across the room, it smashed into it, causing a massive explosion. 

Minutes later, Clive limped out of the building, carrying an unconscious Ros and Yara along with his other injured comrades on his back.

""One down,"" Clive said, coughing blood.

\*\*\*

Favian's ship landed near the second power generator. The Nemesis prepared to repel their enemies, forming a blockade around the building. The United Planets soldiers quickly exited the vessel for battle. And Sarah grew to a giant size to meet the challenge. However, as they were about to charge, Favian stopped them.

""Save your strength,"" Favian said.

He quickly marched to the vanguard, standing between his forces and the enemy, unfazed by their threat. The Nemesis prepared to fire on Favian, but still, he stood unfazed. As the ground started to shake, everyone learned the cause of his confidence. Summoned by Favian, a massive deluge drawn from the fortress’s water supply raced to them, quickly capturing the Nemesis in a colossal water bubble.

Sarah’s eyes widened, seeing Favian’s power. ""Oh, my gods.""

""I’ll make this quick and painless,"" Favian swiped his trident across the air.

The Nemesis struggled as they tried to escape. But Favian held them in place as water filled their lungs. Swiftly, the enemies stopped moving, and Favian burst his bubble, dropping them to the ground dead.

""Half of you form a defensive perimeter while the rest of us go inside.""

""Sir, yes, sir."" The soldiers said in unison.

Hastily, the United Planets soldiers smashed into the building. The soldiers quickly shot at the Nemesis, and Sarah brought the fight to a swift end with one giant stomp on their skulls.

""Good work, Fortitudo,"" Favian said.

""Thanks, sir. Now, let's finish this quickly. There's someone with the med unit I want to get back to.""

Favian hurried over to the power generator. As he moved towards it, he stopped as the sounds of a massacre came from outside. The echoes of terrified screams and plasma fire traveled across the room, hitting their ears like glass shards. But swiftly, everything became as quiet as a grave, with his and Sarah's faces losing color from the deathly silence. In a flash of light, Cybertroopers burst into the room. They shot down their enemies twice as fast as the United Planets, littering the floor with their bodies.

*""Not again,""* Sarah and Favian shouted in unison.

Favian tried to dash to the power generator, but one of the troopers shot him twice in the back. He dropped to the ground, coughing blood, but he struggled back to his feet. And with all his remaining strength, he staggered to his target. The troopers prepared to finish him, but Sarah intervened. She grabbed them all in her giant hands, restraining them to the floor. Still, as before, they released an immense energy field, trying to shock her away. However, even as her flesh burned and pain raced through her body, her grip was undeterred. Set like a boulder in her mind, she refused to relive what happened to Everton.

*""Not again,""* Sarah screamed.

Favian staggered closer and closer to the generator, coughing up more blood. His vision became hazier with every step, but he soldiered forward. Until he reached his target, and with one mighty stab of his trident, it exploded. 

The building collapsed in a fiery explosion. But Sarah swiftly erupted out of the rubble with Favian and several of her surviving comrades in her giant hands. However, as her vision blurred and she fought to maintain consciousness, a realization came. She knew she was no longer fit for duty.

""It's all on you now, Damara.""

\*\*\*

At the center of the fortress, Daisy flew through the air, trying to reach the final power generator. But a deadly opposition was in hot pursuit. Squadron after squadron of enemies covered the air in devotion to murdering Daisy.

Through the air, her pursuers relentlessly bombarded her and Carter. As a storm of plasma bolts rained on them, Flaremane doubled his speed to evade the attack and reach their final destination: a colossal tower. But as the assault magnified, Carter drew his sword to clear a path.*""Take this.""* And an energy slash flew from his blade as he swung it through the air. It cleaved through the enemies, alleviating their assault enough for Flaremane to make one final push to the tower.

With the path clear, Daisy’s vision was glued onto the tower even as the remaining enemies continued shooting. However, inching closer to her destination, she witnessed Cymbeline on top of it. And faster than she could defend, he shot a colossal fireball at them.

*""No,""* Daisy said, horrified.

As the attack neared them, Carter spotted a window on the tower, making a grim choice.""I'm sorry, red."" He quickly picked up Daisy, tossing her at the window. She cut through the air with remarkable speed, crashing through the window into the tower. She evaded the shot as it hit Flaremane's wings, sending him and Carter crashing to the ground.

*""C-Carter, Flaremane,""* Daisy shouted.

Daisy looked at their crash site, tears escaping her eyes, but she remembered Favian's words, forcing herself to continue the mission, running down the corridor.

\*\*\*

On the ground, Carter slowly regained consciousness in a pile of rubble. He sluggishly rose from it to be met with plasma fire from the enemy infantry. But as Carter dodged the attack, the general spotted Flaremane pinned under a pile of rubble as the shots flew by him, running to the stallion's aid. Carter hurried to Flaremane through the hail of plasma bolts. And as he freed him, he made the horse look him in the eye with a glare.

""Okay, horse, you don't like me, and I don't like you. But for Daisy’s sake, we need to work together.""

Flaremane returned Carter's glare, but as the gears of his mind turned, he remembered Daisy's smiling face. With it, he gave Carter a nod. And the stallion swiftly invited Carter onto his back to fly. Carter accepted his invitation, but as he climbed on, Nemesis infantry neared. Still, as they prepared to shoot them, Carter swung his sword, blowing them away with an energy slash. And the two hastily flew through the storm of plasma bolts above from aerial troops.

""Faster, horse, faster.""

Flaremane heeded Carter's command, summoning his speed. But as they neared the tower, the enemies swarmed them from all angles, blocking them. However, flaremane spotted another window, and a solution appeared in his mind with a smug smile. 

Carter saw Flaremane’s smile. ""Horse, what are you about to do?”

Flaremane gave Carter an answer. He flung him off his back to the window, smashing Carter into the tower. And alone, he kept the Nemesis busy as he covered himself in fire. Carter got to his feet and saw him grabbing the aerial troops’ attention, blasting fire in every direction.

Carter cracked a slight smile. ""Thanks, horse.""",1,1760698223.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

# Introduction: Your Journey to Finding the Perfect Apartment Starts Here

 

The process of finding and securing a new apartment can feel overwhelming, but with the right strategy, it can be an exciting journey leading you to your next perfect home. Whether you're moving to a new city, relocating for work, or simply seeking a change of scenery, mastering the rental market requires preparation, savvy searching, and a clear understanding of your needs.

# In today’s competitive real estate landscape, having a plan is essential. This comprehensive guide will walk you through every step of the apartment rental process—from initial budgeting and searching for [**apartments apartments near me**](https://housepointegypt.com/rent/properties) to signing the lease and moving in. We’ll provide expert tips to ensure you find the ideal place, negotiate the best terms, and avoid common pitfalls.

 

# Phase 1: Preparation is Power – Define Your Needs and Budget

 

Before you even glance at a listing, you need to establish your parameters. Successful apartment hunting is rooted in realistic expectations and financial readiness.

 

# 1. Setting a Realistic Budget: The 30% Rule

 

The first, and most crucial, step is determining what you can truly afford. Financial experts widely recommend that your monthly rent (including any utilities, if applicable) should not exceed **30% of your gross monthly income**.

* **Calculate Your Funds:** Factor in not just the monthly rent, but also security deposits (usually one month's rent), application fees (often $50−$100), moving costs, and setting up new utilities. You need significant upfront capital.
* **Hidden Costs:** Don't forget Renter's Insurance (highly recommended), parking fees, pet rent/deposits, and potential HOA/amenity fees.

 

# 2. The Apartment Wish List: Prioritizing Non-Negotiables

 

Once the budget is set, create a detailed list of features, separating them into ""Must-Haves"" (non-negotiables) and ""Nice-to-Haves.""

||
||
|Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable)|Nice-to-Haves (Bonus Features)|
|Number of Bedrooms/Bathrooms|In-unit Washer/Dryer|
|Commute Time/Access to Transit|Gym/Pool Access|
|Pet Policy (if you have pets)|Modern Appliances/Granite Counters|
|Safety of the Neighborhood|Balcony or Patio|
|Adequate Parking|Package Concierge/Secured Entry|

Export to Sheets

Having this list will significantly narrow your search and prevent you from wasting time on unsuitable properties.

 

# 3. Gathering Essential Documents

 

When you find that perfect apartment, the rental market often moves quickly. Being prepared with all necessary documents ensures you can submit a complete and competitive application immediately.

* **Proof of Income:** Recent pay stubs (3-6 months), W-2 forms, or an offer letter for a new job.
* **Identification:** Government-issued photo ID (Driver’s License or Passport).
* **Credit Report & Score:** While the landlord will typically run their own, having yours ready can expedite the process.
* **Rental History:** Contact information for previous landlords (2-3 years) and potentially a current landlord reference letter.
* **Bank Statements:** Proof of sufficient funds for deposits and the first month’s rent.

 

# Phase 2: The Search and Scouting – Finding Quality Apartments Apartments Near Me

 

The digital age has made searching easier, but it also means more competition. A smart, multi-platform search strategy is key to locating the best **apartments apartments near me** that match your criteria.

 

# 4. Utilizing the Best Search Platforms

 

Don't rely on just one website. Cast a wide net using a combination of dedicated rental sites, local listings, and professional property management company websites:

* **Major Rental Aggregators:** Zillow, Apartments.com, Realtor.com, etc. These offer robust filtering options and extensive photo galleries.
* **Local Property Management:** Often, larger complexes list directly on their own sites before they hit the general market.
* **Social Media:** Local neighborhood groups (Facebook, Nextdoor) can often have ""for rent by owner"" or short-term sublet listings.
* **Driving/Walking:** Nothing beats good old-fashioned scouting. Many landlords place ""For Rent"" signs that aren't advertised online. Pay attention to the neighborhoods you want to live in.

 

# 5. Evaluating Neighborhoods and Commute

 

When you’re looking for **apartments near me**, you’re not just renting a space; you’re renting a lifestyle defined by the surrounding area.

* **Visit at Different Times:** A neighborhood quiet during the day might be loud at night (or vice-versa). Visit during rush hour to gauge the actual commute time.
* **Walkability Score:** Look into proximity to grocery stores, parks, coffee shops, and essential services.
* **Safety Data:** Check local crime maps or police reports to get an objective view of neighborhood safety.

**(Word Count Check: Approximately 550 words)**

# Phase 3: The Apartment Viewing and Inspection

 

* **The Check-Up:** Creating a detailed inspection checklist (water pressure, appliances, electrical outlets, mold/pest signs).
* **Asking the Right Questions:** What’s included in the rent? Who handles maintenance? What is the average cost of utilities? Lease term flexibility.

 

# Phase 4: Application, Negotiation, and The Lease

 

* **Submitting a Strong Application:** Tips for standing out in a competitive market.
* **Credit Checks and Background:** Understanding what landlords look for (high credit score, stable income, clean eviction history).
* **Negotiation Tactics:** When and how to negotiate rent, move-in dates, or pet fees.
* **Reading the Lease Agreement (Critically!):** Identifying key clauses: termination conditions, maintenance responsibilities, renewal terms, and rules on subletting or guests.

 

# Phase 5: Moving In and Settling Down

 

* **The Move-In Condition Checklist:** Documenting the apartment's state with photos and videos before unpacking anything to protect your security deposit.
* **Utilities and Change of Address:** Setting up accounts (electricity, internet, gas) and informing the USPS.
* **Renter's Insurance:** Why it is non-negotiable for protecting your belongings.

 

# Conclusion: Securing Your Future Home

 

Finding great **apartments apartments near me** doesn't have to be a stressful ordeal. By being prepared, organized, and proactive—especially with your budget and documents—you gain a competitive edge. Follow these steps, read your lease carefully, and you’ll successfully transition into your perfect new rental home, ready to start the next exciting chapter.

**SEO Notes for Completion:**

1. **Keyword Density:** The full 1500-word article should naturally include variations of the core keywords (e.g., ""rental apartments,"" ""apartments in \[city/area\],"" ""local apartments for rent"") and ensure the exact phrase ""apartments apartments near me"" is used at least 3-4 more times naturally across the remaining text, often in headings or near-heading text.
2. **Heading Structure:** Use H1 (main title), H2 (major phases), and H3 (specific topics) consistently as demonstrated to improve readability and search engine crawlability.
3. **Authority & Trust:** Ensure the remaining sections include authoritative advice (e.g., ""The 30% rule,"" ""Credit check minimums"").
4. **Formatting:** Use bullet points, bolding, and tables (like the one above) to break up the large word count, making the article digestible and Google-friendly (improving the chance of being featured in ""People Also Ask"" boxes or a rich snippet).",1,1760698128.0,u_Slow-Trust6087,0,1.0,False

1o8xzwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1o8xzwb/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_1/,There’s Something Under The Boardwalk [Part 1],"
If you’re reading this, it’s because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It’s only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it’s hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We’re barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it’s already a ghost town. That’s where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

“Spectre’s: Records & Rarities”; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn’t be able to name a single song off the album they’re donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I’d never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I’m not going to play them, who will?

Tonight’s choice: “Secret Treaties” by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew “Don’t Fear the Reaper” — who doesn’t? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70’s. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of “Career of Evil” blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn’t have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled “Harvester of Eyes” certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn’t care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn’t have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old “Plan 9 From Outer Space” poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn’t nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody’s grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it’s so full of life that it’s overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that’s why I never left. If I don’t visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn’t want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent’s Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

“Oh my god! You scared me!” she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. “I’m sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.”

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

“Sure, sure. Three bucks.”

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. “So, any plans tonight?”

I thought about it, and I really didn’t have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick’s for a drink or two until I’ve had enough to put me to sleep.

“I was going to head over to Mick’s, maybe catch the game for a bit.”

She grinned. “I know Mick’s — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I’ll stop by. There isn’t much else to do on a night like tonight.”

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

“Maybe I’ll see you there,” I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

“Hey bud, I haven’t seen you in a while.”

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. “Hey Mac, long time.”

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. “It’s been dead out here, huh?”

Without looking up, he lamented, “Sure has. It’s that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.”

Puzzled, I pressed him. “What do you mean?”

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. “I need to get some help. I’m going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.”

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn’t have been happier.

“That’s great, man! I’d give you a ride myself if I had a car.”

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. “I just need to see her again.”

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

“I haven’t really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and… everything just started falling apart…” he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, “I’m just ready. Tonight’s my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.”

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn’t know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. “Vincent’s was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I’ll see you, I won’t take no for an answer.”

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

“That’s really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.”

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. “I really think what you’re doing is great. It’s been nice knowing you.”

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. “You too. I’d say I’ll see you again, but I really hope it’s not here.”

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

“Hey, what’s your real name, by the way? Maybe I’ll look you up someday to see how you’re doing.”

Without turning fully around, he said, “It doesn’t really matter.”

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick’s resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick’s served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick’s was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick’s was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp’s nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn’t a wasp’s nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was… breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn’t very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn’t help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

I know this is probably my own fault for not being more proactive but ive tried a lot of stuff. meetup events, sports leagues, even tried going to the same bars regularly thinking I'd become a regular and meet people that way. Nothing has really stuck.

Is there something I'm missing? do you just have to get lucky and meet one person who brings you into their group? because the whole starting from scratch thing is brutal.

If you’re reading this, it’s because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It’s only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it’s hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We’re barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it’s already a ghost town. That’s where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

“Spectre’s: Records & Rarities”; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn’t be able to name a single song off the album they’re donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I’d never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I’m not going to play them, who will?

Tonight’s choice: “Secret Treaties” by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew “Don’t Fear the Reaper” — who doesn’t? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70’s. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of “Career of Evil” blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn’t have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled “Harvester of Eyes” certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn’t care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn’t have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old “Plan 9 From Outer Space” poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn’t nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody’s grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it’s so full of life that it’s overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that’s why I never left. If I don’t visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn’t want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent’s Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

“Oh my god! You scared me!” she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. “I’m sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.”

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

“Sure, sure. Three bucks.”

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. “So, any plans tonight?”

I thought about it, and I really didn’t have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick’s for a drink or two until I’ve had enough to put me to sleep.

“I was going to head over to Mick’s, maybe catch the game for a bit.”

She grinned. “I know Mick’s — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I’ll stop by. There isn’t much else to do on a night like tonight.”

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

“Maybe I’ll see you there,” I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

“Hey bud, I haven’t seen you in a while.”

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. “Hey Mac, long time.”

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. “It’s been dead out here, huh?”

Without looking up, he lamented, “Sure has. It’s that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.”

Puzzled, I pressed him. “What do you mean?”

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. “I need to get some help. I’m going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.”

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn’t have been happier.

“That’s great, man! I’d give you a ride myself if I had a car.”

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. “I just need to see her again.”

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

“I haven’t really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and… everything just started falling apart…” he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, “I’m just ready. Tonight’s my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.”

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn’t know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. “Vincent’s was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I’ll see you, I won’t take no for an answer.”

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

“That’s really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.”

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. “I really think what you’re doing is great. It’s been nice knowing you.”

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. “You too. I’d say I’ll see you again, but I really hope it’s not here.”

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

“Hey, what’s your real name, by the way? Maybe I’ll look you up someday to see how you’re doing.”

Without turning fully around, he said, “It doesn’t really matter.”

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick’s resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick’s served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick’s was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick’s was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp’s nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn’t a wasp’s nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was… breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn’t very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn’t help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

I NO LONGER HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. 

I'm up right now at 3am because my wife gets up for work. I still peruse and check in on this Reddit. 

I was a heavy user since 2020 of Feel Free. More or less, 6-12 bottles a day and sprinkle in Zana 500's and OH7's on the days I had less Feel Free. 

Probably aroubd $60,000 or more over that time. 

Long story short - came clean to my wife and the VA - was on subs. Became addicted to them. Back to Feel Free. Then back to subs. Cycle again. 

Years of waking up with the freakouts. 

Finally got the Sublocade shot; never once touched a Feel Free or a Sub again. 

Did the three-shot cycle recommendation and never looked back, and it was honestly easier than I thought. That was in May - now I havent had a shot sonce Sep 1st and I've been lifting weights, running everyday. 

Bank account is full, bills paid (and getting paid) off. Mornings with coffee and motivation instead of dread. 

Again, I was on the heavier, more wild side of using them; hiding spots, secrets, excuses, you name it, I've been there. Now, don't wven think about it. Relationships repaired. 

It can be done but the first step is telling someone. Tapering didnt work for me, so you gotta rip off the bandaid and go see a doc. Fortunately I have the VA, but if you need to pay for it, it's worth it.

I currently have a 10 month old baby who has limited  contact/relationship with my husband’s side of the family. My husband’s parents are divorced although still have good relationships, in fact his dad insists on being very vocal about how good his relations are with ex-wife. Strange to me.

Me and MIL were never close prior to baby, we’re two very different personalities and honestly just don’t gel. I find her dismissive and rude and she probably finds me loud and annoying. She’s very socially awkward, sits silent at a dinner table etc apart from wee jabs here and there. Husband things she’s trying to be funny and get it wrong. The problem is post baby I suffered quite badly from PPD, it shocked me and shook me honestly. I wanted to just be at home with my husband and my baby. However MIL was asking to come visit at the hospital and come to our house etc, I agreed to a visit and it was just too early and just left me feeling resentful and annoyed. This continued and MIL started a whole victim narrative of “I’m not Involved, I want to help more, if you don’t want me to be involved I’ll step away” and this was after my husband had continued to tell her we need time and space and this relationship isn’t just going to magically change overnight and that’s reflective of where we’re at. Long story short poor husband was dragged to multiple “coffees” to just discuss how she felt left out etc. but she never actually practically helped, never did washing, never dropped dinner, continually kissed the baby after we asked not to multiple times and the baby was always uncomfortable with her and never settled. She was a particularly fussy baby in honestly and only really settled with me or dad.

Anyway my issue is, mother in law has a new grandchild and all of the “I want to help” has faded now baby is older. I always found it hard as she never engaged or seemed like she wanted to do anything other than hold the baby. She always would say the right things but never actually actioned. I really do want my child to have a good relationship with grandparents and I’m not niave to the fact me and husband need help. I don’t know whether I’m holding back and being resentful or how to move forward. I guess I’m just looking for similar insight or experiences",2,1760697559.0,UKParenting,1,1.0,False

If you’re reading this, it’s because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It’s only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it’s hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We’re barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it’s already a ghost town. That’s where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

“Spectre’s: Records & Rarities”; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn’t be able to name a single song off the album they’re donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I’d never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I’m not going to play them, who will?

Tonight’s choice: “Secret Treaties” by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew “Don’t Fear the Reaper” — who doesn’t? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70’s. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of “Career of Evil” blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn’t have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled “Harvester of Eyes” certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn’t care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn’t have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old “Plan 9 From Outer Space” poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn’t nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody’s grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it’s so full of life that it’s overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that’s why I never left. If I don’t visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn’t want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent’s Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

“Oh my god! You scared me!” she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. “I’m sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.”

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

“Sure, sure. Three bucks.”

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. “So, any plans tonight?”

I thought about it, and I really didn’t have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick’s for a drink or two until I’ve had enough to put me to sleep.

“I was going to head over to Mick’s, maybe catch the game for a bit.”

She grinned. “I know Mick’s — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I’ll stop by. There isn’t much else to do on a night like tonight.”

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

“Maybe I’ll see you there,” I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

“Hey bud, I haven’t seen you in a while.”

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. “Hey Mac, long time.”

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. “It’s been dead out here, huh?”

Without looking up, he lamented, “Sure has. It’s that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.”

Puzzled, I pressed him. “What do you mean?”

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. “I need to get some help. I’m going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.”

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn’t have been happier.

“That’s great, man! I’d give you a ride myself if I had a car.”

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. “I just need to see her again.”

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

“I haven’t really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and… everything just started falling apart…” he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, “I’m just ready. Tonight’s my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.”

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn’t know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. “Vincent’s was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I’ll see you, I won’t take no for an answer.”

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

“That’s really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.”

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. “I really think what you’re doing is great. It’s been nice knowing you.”

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. “You too. I’d say I’ll see you again, but I really hope it’s not here.”

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

“Hey, what’s your real name, by the way? Maybe I’ll look you up someday to see how you’re doing.”

Without turning fully around, he said, “It doesn’t really matter.”

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick’s resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick’s served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick’s was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick’s was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp’s nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn’t a wasp’s nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was… breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn’t very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn’t help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

If you’re reading this, it’s because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It’s only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it’s hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We’re barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it’s already a ghost town. That’s where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

“Spectre’s: Records & Rarities”; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn’t be able to name a single song off the album they’re donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I’d never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I’m not going to play them, who will?

Tonight’s choice: “Secret Treaties” by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew “Don’t Fear the Reaper” — who doesn’t? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70’s. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of “Career of Evil” blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn’t have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled “Harvester of Eyes” certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn’t care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn’t have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old “Plan 9 From Outer Space” poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn’t nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody’s grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it’s so full of life that it’s overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that’s why I never left. If I don’t visit, who will?

1o8xs4a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8xs4a,Staedtler 925 85 REG,"* **MODEL:**

Staedtler 925 85 REG – model **925 85-05**  
0.5 mm *(only available in 0.5 mm)*    

* **MATERIALS:**

Externally, the REG is full-metal, or more precisely, full-aluminum. Internally, you get a plastic lead tube and a full-brass clutch.

* **ERASER:**

Soft white latex rubber, in a metal housing. To my dismay, it does NOT come with a lead-jam clearing rod 😣. Moreover, it’s a lick wider than the eraser that comes with the [925 25](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1nieikh/staedtler_925_25/).

* **MEASUREMENTS:**

The REG measures, from tip to eraser cap, 140 mm. However, according to what you set the lead dispensing mechanism, that can vary from 139.5 to 141 mm. The body was a width of 8.7 mm, and that increases to 9 mm at the grip. It’s also a heavy mechpen, tipping my coffee scale at 22.36 mm. The center of mass is slightly forward of the half-length point, at 66 mm. And of course, that will slightly vary according to how you set the lead dispensing feature.

* **FEATURES:**

As the name says, the REG is a *regulator*, which means that you can set how much lead will come out with each knock. See that knurled ring between the eraser cap and pocket clip? Depending on how much you twist it, a knock will advance from 0.1 mm up to 3 mm of lead. And, as you twist the ring, it will show more or less of a black bar on the “regulator window”, at the top of the body. That way you can have an idea of how much lead will come out with each press of the eraser cap. Moreover, it also has “.5” printed on top of the eraser cap. Does that mean that Staedtler plans to release the REG in other calibers in the future 🤔?

* **AESTHETICS:**

Very nice! Well, if you like metal mechpens. I happen to approve of that industrial tool look, so I think it looks quite snazzy.

* **ERGONOMICS:**

Again, very nice! The REG has great dimensions, with a very good weight and weight distribution, so it feels really good in my hand. The only detail is the texture of the grip, that is a lot smoother than the grip on the 925 25/35. That being the case, it will possibly (probably?) be slippery in sweaty hands.

* **MY THOUGHTS:**

Released in June of 2025, the REG is a reissue of the original REG of 2004. I may be wrong, but I think it’s solely directed at the collector’s market. Nonetheless, this is a SOLID mechpen. However, in my eyes, the regulator feature is just a gimmick. Set it once to your liking and probably you’ll never again mess with it – the same opinion I had about my OHTO [Super Promecha](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1l32vah/ohto_super_promecha_pm1509p/). Don’t get me wrong, it works, and very well, in fact, but it’s a feature that in practical terms doesn’t add anything to your writing experience. A detail that left me flabbergasted, however, is the absence of a lead-jam clearing rod. Come on, the REG isn’t cheap and if it’s truly directed towards collectors, why no lead-jam clearing rod? For Pete’s sake, the MUCH cheaper [925 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1mtihir/staedtler_925_15/) has that feature in all calibers 🤨.

Independent of gimmicky feature and no lead-jam clearing rod, the REG is a really nice mechpen to use. Well, if you don’t have sweaty hands, of course… And as a collector’s piece, it is awesome.",6,1760697266.0,mechanicalpencils,0,0.88,False

_________________________________________________
Chuck E Cheese is well known by this subreddit, but for those who are casual fans of the restaurant; you should be made aware of the fact that the restaurant chain has gone bankrupt twice. 1984 (video game crash of 1980s) and 2020. (COVID-19)

Let's say the year is 2040. Conflicts in East Asia and South America flare up, and many AI companies have a 2000's tech bubble burst due to the Year 2038 problem.

_________________________________________________
I think, in the present day, 5 years after declaring bankruptcy and reorganizing, Chuck E Cheese is doing much better. Exact figures are hard to come by, but their revenue is still in the millions, and they haven't seen to shutdown too many restaurants, and lots of their locations are hiring. If Elon Musk were to buy Chuck E Cheese, I would estimate he'd only pay $600M to $1B

_________________________________________________

Chuck E Cheese between 2025-2040 does okayishly well and has some corporate rebranding, with a focus on dance floors and mascot costumes and less on animatronics and other things.

But in 2040 Chuck E Cheese declares bankruptcy.

Where do I come in?           

Either 5 ways.

1. I luck out and become rich. (most unlikely) Somehow I write fanfiction, and become a famous author, win some high stakes poker games, and do some videos that make good money from sponsorships and ads and such. $100m.

2.I work in finance (I start as an intern in my roommate's dad's company) and rise up the corporate ladder to where I can give some financial advice. My advice: acquire that Chuck E Cheese thing. (Not my money, but the firms' money, and I perhaps get put into management for my idea, and raise corporate profits for the Cheese and the financial firm.)

3. Related to 2, but more bootstraps-esque, I finish law school and become a lawyer. Some kid was caught drunk driving and killed a lady, I help this kid get off on a technicality. (Also I mean, he might have someone too much and the pledge dies, or something serious but spoiled rich-boy like, that people do) His dad (rich guy) ((also maybe I help HIM get out of some legal sketchiness)) is so happy that he asks me if he can do me a favor. I give him the good investment advice of buying Chuck E Cheese, and perhaps making me the top management man.

4. I put my legal skills and business skills to good use, and open my own restaurant and find someone who's really great at engineering. Chuck E Cheese doesn't do animatronics anymore, so the market is yearning for that. Somehow we do better than Chuck E Cheese because we follow the stuff below and we buy Chuck E Cheese.

5. Working up the corporate ladder at Chuck E Cheese from cashier, to technician, to manager, to franchisee owner, to CEO himself. 
_________________________________________________

Each one of these ways changes what I do to fix the company in 2040, when I see it bankrupt for the third time and in a sorry state. (In my opinion it is already in a sorry state)

_________________________________________________

How do I fix Chuck E Cheese?

From way #4 we just do what we will do below, but instead of using Chuck E Cheese animatronics we mostly use the one's from the restaurant me and my friend made. Sometimes some of the Chuck E Cheese original cast is there, but also sometimes not.

From #1-3 and way #5 we do this:


Locations

Chuck E Cheese has about 500 locations. Most of them are in the United States, so I would focus just on America. I believe Chuck E Cheese must categorize its locations into 3 types: kids (Chuck E Cheese - Pizza Time!), teens (Helen's Hangout) and adults/older teens (Jasper's Retro Diner).

Generally speaking, most older restaurants would be Pizza Time! restaurants. Some may become Helen's Hangouts and Jasper's Retro Diners but I seriously doubt it. (You'll see why) 

The placement of these restaurants is important. Every city in America with 100,000 people or more should have a Pizza Time! Restaurant, or a restaurant at least planned. If there is a Retro Diner or Helen's Hangouts nearby, then a Pizza Time! restaurant should be within 5 miles. Every state and U.S. territory should have one of each restaurant.

The Pizza Time! restaurants will not have alcohol served. The only place you can buy alcohol is the Retro Diner with valid photo ID.

These kid restaurants will have skytubes, a ball pit, and a trampoline part. (You need a waiver for the trampoline). All of these areas are generally sanitized and... free. Yeah. Also you can get 100 tokens (like actual tokens) for half of whatever the minimum wage is in your state. (or city if you see Mamdani's plan in NYC). Every game costs a token to play. You can also use those play cards if you'd like. The games would be what you expect from a Chuck E Cheese except you'd get more tickets and there is more flashing lights and jingling keys. There are still dance floors and someone that wears the mascot costumes every half hour to dance with kids.

The Helen Hangouts would have less young kid games, and more teenage-fun games (PG to PG-13). There would be a bowling rink and arcade games. There would be VR headset games. There would be a climbing wall and bumper cars. (You need waivers for these) Not much to say here. Tokens/play cards cost the above for these and the Retro Diners.

Now, the Retro Diners. We have roller skating here, and arcade games that might be a little too intense for kids and not really the best for teenagers to play. Also yes, retro games are here too, but young kids aren't playing Tetris. Yes, alcohol is served here, but in accordance with the law, ID must be shown. (This is to stop fights at little kids birthday areas) (Also having designated adult areas probably makes it obvious who the parents are, and who the predators are in the Pizza Time! restaurant) It is kind of adult because teens probably come here to make out. It's a great spot for a first date.

Being a franchise owner is also cool too. You have to pay very little, but you need to showcase skills and pass a lot of exam and background checks before becoming an owner. (Think Chick-fil-A and how hard it is to become an owner)

Now in terms, of the online space, let's look at why some people will come. Chuck E Cheese will make a mobile game and work with several famous Roblox games to do something, where online playing equals real-life physical prizes.

The brand image is important too. No DMCA strikes are happening, (Streisand Effect) but official pictures of employee rooms, and animatronics with no suit on will be scrubbed from the internet. Old Chuck E Cheese movies and official posts before my time as management will be hard to find. Gone are the days with old Chuck E Cheese lore. Here it is very simply: Chuck E Cheese grew up poor in the streets of San Fransisco, but stumbled into a talent show audition, and that worked his way into having his 8 (yes) member band. We may release an animated kids movie.

Employees

Night security

The place may be in danger of being robbed. The security job is super important. We will employ people just to make sure the building is safe. His designated room in the employees only section should have more than one entrance and exit. Two shall suffice. 

Janitors and Technicians

People complain Chuck E Cheese bathrooms are disgusting. A major thing we will do is do what Buc-ees does and focus heavily on cleaning the bathrooms, and stop semi trucks from being in the parking lot (also reducing human trafficking) They will also clean the skytubes, ball pit and trampolines. Technicians should also be paid well to fix the animatronics and video games.

Cooks

They should be paid well, also they shouldn't be doing the jobs of security or cleaning, or being a technician.

Miscellaneous 

There should also be someone to make sure nobody gets kidnapped and use that stamp thingy.
Also someone must wear the mascot costume. Chuck E Cheese Entertainment LLC assumes full cost of cleaning it. Ew.

The minimum wage at a Chuck E Cheese is $20 an hour.
All personnel that regularly interact with kids should have a thorough background check, otherwise it's not required.


Pizza

This is where we make the real money. The reason why tokens are cheap and physical play is free is because the pizza costs good money. You can pay per slice or per pizza. Domino's makes good money from selling pizza, just they don't get massive sales from having arcade machines, bowling rink, and other such things.

Food

Okay, we sell other things. French fries, Dipping Dots, Donuts, Hot Dogs, Slurpees, Sodas, coffee, wings, candy, chips, meatballs, and cake. There would be a separate area for Doordash or UberEats delivery people to come pick up food to deliver it.

Family
At the Pizza Time! restaurant pregnant moms get a free 100 tokens that can be redeem everyday and any day.

Politics

To keep animatronic costs low, we will do our best to support candidates for public office who opposed patents on animatronic designs. We want animatronics to be open sourced and free for all to make and enjoy. It also keeps costs low by having lots of competition. We will support Democrats, Republicans, even third parties if they agree with us on this issue.
Any involvement in politics after this, is an employee issue, not a Fazbear issue.

Also, we will try to employ people to become our technicians based on work we've seen online, like Citra.

Birthdays 

It's $20 plus the cost of the cake for the Happy Birthday package.

It's $50 for the Happy Birthday Deluxe package. Chuck E Cheese visits your table, among other things.

Both allow you to go in the ticket blast, and you get 500 tokens.

Marketing

Most controversial of my proposals yet. Chuck E Cheese will be advertised by some ads involving our mascot. We want him EVERYWHERE, on all the kids shows.
But here's where it gets iffy. We have a member of Munch's make believe band called Bella Bunny. She's being slutified (like toy chica, but she will be depicted as an adult). What does this have to do with advertising? I want to have Miss America models and/or Slavic women promote Chuck E Cheese. It may be like the American Eagle ad, or it may not.


Animatronics

The big part.

There are 8 main animatronics. Chuck E Cheese, Helen, Jasper, Mr. Munch, Pasqually, Bella, Sally Sashay, and Wolfy (a squirrel-porcupine hybrid ripped from Great Wolf Lodge, maybe we should acquire them too). ((Also, maybe we should acquire small animatronic companies, and buy the rights to small creators, like the Billy Bob's Wonderland guy)). Anyway, we should have Bella all sexy-looking. The rest of the animatronics are full body Cyberamics (Helen, Jasper, and Mr. Munch) or Concept unification (Pasqually), Wolfy, would be a full body one, and Sally would be made into a full body Cyberamics. These 8 animatronics would be the same no matter which place you go but there would be 3 differing animatronics depending on the place you go. The Pizza Time restaurants would have Crusty Copernicus (a conjoined twin animatronic of crusty the cat and a cat from a Chuck E Cheese show.) Kids can dissemble this at will on Saturdays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, like Lego pieces, but it is bolted into place on every other day. There would also be Harmony Howlette at the other end of the restaurant. Also the Warblettes would be near the entrance of the restaurant. At the Retro Diner, you would have Justin Beaver, The King, and Nigel the Sasquatch. At the Hangout you would have Ronnie the Unicorn, LeBron James, and the gorilla from Billy Bob's Wonderland.

You can also rent out animatronics for your birthday event at your house.

In terms of behavior, and for spare parts, Chuck E Cheese is by himself, Helen and Sally are together, Jasper, and Wolfy, Sally and Mr. Munch, Pasqually by himself, and Bella by herself.

So that's it. What do you think?

1o8xoni,https://i.redd.it/gapktjtvfnvf1.png,The Bell Witch,"I’ve never been the kind of person who believes in folklore.
I study geography at university—maps, landscapes, and weather patterns fascinate me, not ghost stories. The Appalachian Mountains, with their length and complexity, always struck me as a perfect blend of beauty and mystery. Every time I saw photos online—mist rolling through valleys, endless forests fading into blue—I’d imagine how quiet it must be.

So when the semester ended, I decided to go see it for myself. No plan, no group trip, just me, a car, and my phone’s GPS. My idea was simple: drive down, hike a bit, take photos, and write something for my travel journal.

The drive took longer than I expected. Hours passed with only the radio and the hum of the tires for company. I stopped at a small town—one of those places that doesn’t show up on most maps—because my phone signal kept dropping and I wanted something to eat before continuing.

The diner sat right off the road, a squat white building with faded red letters that said EATS. There were only two cars in the lot. When I went inside, a bell above the door jingled and a woman behind the counter smiled at me.

“You’re not from around here,” she said.

Her accent had that soft Appalachian rhythm to it—drawn out but friendly.

“Just driving through,” I told her. “Headed toward the trail. Thought I’d stop for some coffee.”

A few old men were sitting in a booth, their cups steaming, conversation quiet but steady. I ordered pancakes and sat near the window. For a while it was peaceful, until one of the men looked my way and said, “You goin’ up the mountain this time of year?”

I nodded. “Yeah. I’ve read about it for years. Just wanted to see it.”

He smirked. “Hope you’re not the superstitious type.”

The others laughed a little. The waitress shot them a look.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“Ah, it’s nothin’,” one of them said. “Tourists always wanna see somethin’ spooky. Bell Witch, Bigfoot, haints in the holler. You can’t throw a stone without hittin’ a ghost story out here.”

“Bell Witch?” I repeated.

The waitress frowned at him. “Don’t start that.”

But I was curious. “Who’s the Bell Witch?”

They looked at each other like deciding who’d answer. Finally, the oldest of them—a man with gray stubble and a trucker’s cap—set down his cup.

“Old story from Tennessee,” he said. “Family called Bell. Back in the early 1800s, they got tormented by some spirit. Said it talked, moved things, made people sick. Killed the old man eventually. Folks said she cursed the bloodline—promised she’d come back.”

He chuckled. “But that’s old wives’ talk. Locals do a little ritual every few years, just to keep her quiet. Something about buryin’ a jar by the river, near the cave where she lived.”

The waitress rolled her eyes. “Don’t scare the boy.”

I smiled politely, but inside, the name stuck with me. Bell Witch. A ritual by the river.

After I paid, I thanked them and left. I had no intention of going witch-hunting—but something about the way they talked made me curious. It wasn’t the words, exactly. It was the tone—half joking, half serious, like a story they’d grown up with but never dared test.

That night, I found a cheap motel. I googled “Bell Witch” while brushing my teeth. The results were endless—websites, YouTube documentaries, even tourist spots. One place kept showing up: the Bell Witch Cave, not far from where I already was.

I told myself I’d stop by in the morning. Not because I believed in curses, but because I was already there. Why not see what inspired all those stories?


---

The next day was overcast.
The cave was smaller than I expected—a hole in the side of a hill, fenced off with a sign explaining the legend. No one else was around. I parked, walked up, and felt that quiet you only get in places untouched by cities.

Someone had left flowers by the entrance, wilted and brown. There were coins scattered in the dirt, maybe from tourists. I crouched down and saw a small glass jar half buried near a rock—its lid rusted shut. I assumed it was part of that “ritual” the men mentioned, but it looked old.

The rational part of me said it was just something someone left as part of a story, maybe even a prank. But another part of me—smaller, less defined—felt like I was intruding.

Still, I took a photo and left.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The motel air conditioner made a soft clicking sound that reminded me of footsteps. At one point, I thought I heard whispering, so faint it could’ve been wind. I told myself it was just nerves.

The next morning, I drove to a nearby town to get breakfast. The woman at the gas station looked up from her paper when I asked for directions.

“You from outta state?” she asked.

“Yeah. Just driving through. Visited the cave yesterday.”

Her expression changed instantly. “You went to the cave?”

“Yeah. Just sightseeing.”

She shook her head. “Don’t go near that place again.”

I laughed awkwardly, thinking she was joking, but she didn’t smile.


---

The following nights were worse.

My phone alarm went off at 3:17 a.m.—I never set it for that time. I woke up, sweating, sure someone was standing near the door. When I turned on the light, nothing was there.

The next day, my photos from the cave were gone. Every one. The folder was empty.

Then came the sound. A low hum, like someone breathing close to my ear whenever I tried to sleep. Sometimes I’d catch a whisper—soft, genderless—saying words I couldn’t make out.

I started coughing a lot. Thought maybe it was mold from the motel. My throat felt raw. My reflection in the mirror looked paler every morning.

I wanted to leave, but I kept thinking I’d just finish the trip, then rest at home. I told myself it was anxiety, that I was being stupid.

But the feeling followed me.

At a rest stop near the state line, I bought a bottle of water and saw the cashier staring at me. “You okay, son?” he asked.

I nodded. He pointed to my chin. “You’re bleedin’.”

When I wiped it, there was dark streak on my sleeve—not red, more like ink. I tried to joke about it, but my voice sounded wrong, like an echo under water.

That was the last clear thing I remember.


---

When the police found my car, it was parked by the edge of the river, engine cold. The driver’s door was open. My phone was still recording a voice memo—just static and what sounded like wind.

Locals said it reminded them of another story, two hundred years old—the death of John Bell.

According to reports later published in the county paper, the man was identified as Evan Bell, age 23, a university student from Ohio. Genealogical records traced his family line back seven generations to John Bell of Adams, Tennessee.

Experts called it coincidence. Locals called it proof.

Since then, no one in town talks about the cave anymore. The diner’s still open, but when travelers mention the Appalachian Trail, the waitress just smiles politely and changes the subject.

And at the bottom of the hill, by the river’s bend, a new jar appeared—sealed tight, half-buried in the soil.

No one knows who left it.

1o8xocc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1o8xocc/can_the_ninja_do_a_coffee_créma/,Can the ninja do a coffee Créma?,"Hello together,

I’m considering the Ninja 601, but the only thing holding me back is whether it can make about 150 ml of coffee with crema (not the filter coffee option).

I’ve been using a De’Longhi Dedica for 7 years and usually drink about 150 ml made from a double basket of espresso. I’d like to upgrade, mainly because I either need to buy a good grinder or switch to a machine with a built-in one so I can finally use whole beans (shame on me).

From what I’ve read, the Premier model can only make a quad using the quad basket — unless you “trick” the machine by turning it off and on again.

Does anyone else have made the experience and can tell me if that works?
