i’ve been thinking a lot lately about how to look cuter at work. we have a very small but adorable coffee shop and a lot of customers seem drawn to it more for the aesthetics than the actual drinks. in the past i’ve always worn my longish hair up either in braids, ponytails, claw clips, buns, etc. for convenience and hygienes sake, but lately i’ve been thinking about trying to wear it down! i do have accessories such as headbands, barrettes, etc, that only really look good when my hair is down.

I wanted to check with y’all for feedback about hair styles. how do you wear yours? if you came into a coffee shop and the barista DID have their hair down, would you judge them? has anyone had issues with their hair? ending up in food/drink? overstimulating? overheating you? ending up gross and dirty by the end of the day?

I’d love some to hear both from a customer AND a barista perspective about this! feedback would be much appreciated!!

1ps5am2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1ps5am2/mil_too_its_blown_up_and_we_need_advice_please/,MIL too?! It's blown up and we need advice please,"Reported after format problem cut it. 

Sorry, this will be long but I feel some relevant back story is needed for context. We need advice, guidance, solidarity.... I don't know. It's a new situation I've found myself in that's similar but different to the history of NPD I've known from my own NM. With Xmas a few days away, it can either kick off again, or rug sweep, or whatever other way and I need to know my / our new boundaries is right. 


Usually I read and lurk. It's helped immensely over the years. But a recent situation with the in laws has me and husband (HB) wondering wtf.


My mother is uNPD, and around 10-12 years ago it was suggested BPD (more histonic, but definitely Queen/Waif). My grandmother seems along those lines. I've been NC with NM for 3 years now. Middle sibling is NC with NM too for several years, youngest is low contact. We seem the rarer kind of just ignored of NC. There's no chasing, no forced monkeys, nothing. 



The players who I'll keep vague-ish are myself (hitting 40). Husband (HB, late 30s, got together 15 yrs ish, married 13, separated but cohabiting since beginning of year). I have my eldest, now adult, then together there is two under five (Little 1 and Little 2). 
There's his parents, FIL and MIL (early 60s) separated well over 20 years but very close, daily talks, frequent holidays, visits etc. SIL 1 is couple years older than HB. Has a near adult child. SIL 2 adult, 10-15 yrs junior from MIL second / current marriage. 


Before we got together he'd only ever see MIL at Xmas or if they did a family occasion. After we lived together and before we had Littles, MIL would drive past our home to visit SIL 1 and or FIL and just not stop to say hi. We lived several streets away from both, in the middle of their homes. Didn't bother him but he said he was used to it. Then Little 1 came and it went from seeing the females of the family 4-6 times a year at most instead of maybe 2 times. 

Then HB changed. He started displaying behavior that reminded me of my NM. Selfishness. Always the victim. Shift blaming and gas lighting. He would instantly go into defence mode and react. By then I had already fallen pregnant with Little 2. I was still dealing with my NM at this point. I am the eldest. The therapist. The scapegoat. The one who parented my siblings and her. The straw was an ""accident"" that caused Little 1 a known allergy reaction and a comment on the cause of a certain SEN - she didn't even bother with a ""not X/eldest"" to bait a reaction. I texted saying I had too much going on and needed distance, including from her. End 2023.

Little 2 born. (All healthy and fine now). HB gets worse. SiL 1 keeps saying I should be open and honest with her about it and kept saying I'm ""family"". So beginning of 2024 I do, I text somewhat frequently and at times she speaks with him. He starts therapy. We all try to find the cause in this switch. He would see it afterwards but just react the moment anything would push him into defence mode. I told him I wouldn't have it around the children so he needed to figure out where and why this was coming from as it was only towards me.


 A few times during 2023/2024, MIL would offer to come or meet up, and it got to the point he'd say *I* would be uncomfortable with it, or I wouldn't want to etc. I was never asked and actually pushed him to go mingle with family and friends. He never had a close relationship with MIL/SIL and he certainly didn't want one now. In Laws always seemed to have the family trait of rug sweeping, avoiding conflict, etc but instead of just saying he didn't want to, my name was dropped. Afterwards he'd always tell them I didn't say that and he doesn't know why he said that.  

On having Little 2 and this behaviour, at the end of 2023 I drop the rope of taking his responsibilities re In Laws. Birthdays, Xmas, etc I now had two littles with health needs, my own auto immune condition flared (we now know a second started). I wouldnt chase contact. I wouldn't be the responsible one for his side for it. I wouldnt buy and make hampers and go buy and drop off cakes. If I'm picking up his slack at home he could deal with his own family. I didn't have capacity to. I'd still be me and interact, attend, talk but my mental load was full. I had just gone no contact with NM and needed to deal. He was fine with this and of course meant it never happened lol. 


End of 2024 MIL came for a chat we requested, which I think was the total of third and last visit for 2024. All three sat and I went through his behavior he had already told her. I asked if there was signs of some kind of neurodivergence as a child, maybe that's something we can look into. I wanted to talk to her as I did not accept this behaviour for myself especially for my children, we both wanted to see if there was a reason why, apparently. Yes some looked like NM sliver but my ND eldest can come across the same and maybe the responsibility of having to grow up now he had two littles kids meant the masking stopped? I just wanted to see if this was a life thing or a recent thing. 


She said no nothing, he was just like her, crap with money, hates feeling bad. (Side info, late 2018 me and HB had a tragic situation out of our control.) Then she said that where I had a trauma childhood (she doesn't know the half of it so wtf), I have a ""thicker skin"" whereas HB didn't so the 2018 event was harder on him, he didn't get enough help (neither did really) and when Little 2 was born it set it off. I just said ""right."". She would always excuse it so just accepted and stopped. He scrolled the whole time two feet away. We had a discussion after how the whole purpose was to talk to his mum and he didn't bother. That id tried. It started before Little 2, they knew this. I was upset as he let her use that as an excuse and not take accountability or remind her it started before. He didn't want to upset her to her face. So he let her. I said he needed to get more therapy and as far as I was concerned I wanted to separate. 

I later found out in a conversation about a visit shortly after that where he said I'd be uncomfortable due to her comment of excusing his behaviour what happened to us in 2018. That caused an argument. He said he didn't understand why he said it as he knew it wasn't true and would tell MIL this, but she was upset and kept asking so he agreed.


New years I found the truth. For many years he had an online addiction that escalated to dating sites. I told him I knew. The dates on sites visits matched to events of behaviour. And it started before 2018 so that as I thought, it all had *nothing* to do with it. We talked. Alot. He said he felt shame. I said he knew this all along and hadn't been honest with anyone, not me, them or therapists. How did he expect to address something he hid? He signed up for specific therapy. I told SIL 1 with proof. I told her she deserved to know as did his mother. That I told him he should meet them for coffee as to allow them to believe excuses when he knew the truth, wasn't fair and the first step in any progress is being honest and taking accountability. I told her I had left the ""family chat"" as I had already withdrawn socially the past year due to everything and now we were separated, he needed to explain things. Not me feeling uncomfortable when I'm asked if I'm good and I say no. I won't and can't pretend, I'm dropping the rope, he can deal with his family but I wasn't stepping away just back. He can explain why we are separated now if anyone asks, his family, his responsibility. Like me with mine. She said she understood. That was Jan 2025. 


I had slowed contact with SIL mid 2024 and stopped end 2024, it felt like she would wave her finger and tut to the behaviour and or him but nothing actually meaningful. There was no coffee meets, no visits, no help with talking to either really, very surface level. In Feb 2014 Little 1 needed urgent medical so she came at 10pm to sit with other so we could take her in until 6am I think. I don't think we actually saw her at all for 2024 after that. 

Noone wanted to visit despite many offers, none wanted to actually do as they said they would by being closer to him us or our kids. So after Jan 2025 I just haven't reached out to any of them. I told him he needed to meet them and be honest but I was done. He can deal with visits, contact etc.


Between Dec 24 and Feb 25, In calls to arrange, MIL would again bring up whether I'd be comfortable with her coming and every time he'd say he has already explained many times she did not make me uncomfortable, I had no problem with any of them nor anyone coming, I've always encouraged it due to lack of grandparents my side. (I would bite my tongue if/when something happens/said or the huge difference in treatment to him/our kids as I didn't want to be the problem when he was the one most hurt. 

After new year, He said he understands and agrees why, and will try to meet his mum for coffee as he agrees anything like that should not be round Littles. A full cards on table of his online addiction causing his poor behaviour and either lying, glossing over or just flat out scapegoating me to MIL so he wasn't ""the bad guy"" to her. 


Feb 2025 he met MIL. After he started to tell her, she said SIL already told her. She praises his honesty and she wants to be a bigger part of his life and to help. She asked if I was still uncomfortable with the excuse she gave for him Nov 2024. He said he told her several times before then she didn't, explained I was upset with him when especially now it's proven it had nothing to do with it. He told me he had to say a couple of times I have never and don't hold ill will towards her and reiterated how it was him that caused it by feeling on the spot, worried about upsetting her so used me as the excuse and he apologised again, asking if she finally understands and will stop asking. She says yes. He said if at any point she wants to talk to me about it, the separation, etc then not around the kids. It has to be when the kids are not around so if we went for coffee or something. She said she understands and agrees that's best for them. (Remember this part).

Weeks later we were told that after that coffee meet, days later she had to be rushed to hospital as she thought she was having a heart attack. Bad knees (hence excitable big dogs not good). She doesn't like to drive past lunchtime as it gets busy hence any visits were always mid morning and short and needed to be planned. (Works shifts and travels ok for that). ""Wears her heart on her sleeve"" emotional person. They didn't need to use the words he caused it for it be felt that. It turned out to be her anxiety. He told me how she's always been overly emotional and that's why no one ever wants to upset her for her reaction - I actually said he needs to sit and think of who that reminds him of. Maybe that was an angle to bring up in therapy as a learnt technique to avoid confrontation and accountability. He fully agreed it was possible.

Since then we have had at least 5-6 occasions, as per normal since the littles came, where MIL arranged to visit and then cancels within 24 hrs of coming. The last few she didn't even bother with the excuse to say she was having ""sniffles"" and if he asked if she's ok and she just said yes but plans have changed, last attempt in August. That point he said he can't be bothered with chasing the same treatment of him, me and the kids. 

Side note - For years when she would come or when he would speak to SIL or MIL, or we met at Xmas, a day out, a visit, a meet was offered for largely me but sometimes all of us to join. He / I agreed it would be fun. He'd then see on social media it went ahead without us/me. It didn't bother me (remember I'm ""thick skinned"" 🙄) but it upset him. He told MIL once or twice on the next offer this but nothing changed. He never understood why not only he wasn't treated differently to siblings but me and our children too. He and I had noticed a switch in 2024 towards me beginning of 2024 where on the odd occasion his mum would visit, I'd start talking and she would just turn to him and start a different conversation looking back this is when I then became his reason. Still no excuse. 

FIL still dropped by randomly through out the year. Nothing was ever brought up but they all just avoid creating conflict or upset. We cohabited and yes a shoddy husband but Littles needs just can't be done by one person all the time and he's a good father. The cause coming to light has meant real work started and change happens. We worked well together for over a decade and have this year focusing on kids first. This year he has learnt alot. Grown a lot. He also recognised he was acting like a mix of my own mother and his. This year has been calmer with shared goals, there's been no online searching of ego boosting validation from others (I did check randomly). With visits from FIL (no one else bothers) we appear normal. We weren't touchy before so on the outside it hasn't changed that much, but I found my strength, my voice and myself this year. So ie spoiler alert - no ""problems at home"" and certainly, none that was told or seen of to/by any In Law they haven't been here lol. 

But apart from a fleeting passing by stop while FIL drove spring time, that's it for this year of me or kids seeing SIL 1 since Feb 2024, contact since Jan. That and a funeral late Spring for HB. No other contact. MIL been here once in summer (plus last month) since Nov last year. Last month was the first time I spoke to her since Nov 2024. He hasn't spoken to them really since Feb unless it was MIL arranging/canceling. If FIL had been told, his visits weren't any different. But both of us noticed a switch around May time. He would only talk family personal or financial with HB when I left the room or they were alone otherwise it felt very surface like I was an outsider. So we believed he had been told and I said to HB that's fine. It's ok if they don't expect us to remain open between ourselves despite the closer of his parents. We'd probably get the same from everyone as that's normal after separation. 


End August 2025 FIL comes as he received a midnight text from NM. First type of any contact to or for/against me since NC started. She said she had learnt we had had another baby (she knew three years prior, I told her and along the way, had minimal knowledge via sibling). She said I cut contact as she went on holiday (she wen on several every year so why would that matter lol). She wanted FIL to ""ask HB why she hasn't held baby. Why. "" I told him to ignore it. By that point she would've been at least 2-3 cans in and probably someone at work had a kid and she needed someone to feel sorry for her. We all three agreed we knew it was lies, exaggeration, being a victim and wanting sympathy. She was just trying to triangulate me and even HB now from his dad. I thanked him to telling us and giving us all a laugh. HB asked if she had messaged MIL too and he said as far as he knew, no. 

Now bare in mind that several times throughout the year, every year, he sends everyone his shift pattern. 

*Beginning of the End*
End October MIL and FIL suddenly turns up to bring Little 1 gifts. I had the dogs in the utility, all the toys and lounge stuff in the kitchen and the lounge floor pulled up, half way through laying the underlay. Dogs start going mad (young and excitable), Little 1 does the normal shy hide and quiet, Little 2 goes running round the room excited. Chaos. All later heard by HB on the doorbell camera. They say ""not a good time? Haha"" and I say no not really. I'm told they won't be long. I had to move part of the new flooring to part open the door, FIL had to squeeze through, move more to open etc all while the dogs busted into and through the kitchen, then into lounge all excited and FIL gets mad, I'm losing my shizzle trying to control everything. I had to get eldest to come down and go sit in the garden with the dogs (Which is also unfair). 

At the start, end and twice in-between MIL asked if me and her were ok, was I mad at her, did she upset me. The first time I said no, like he told you back in Feb your comment didn't upset me. Him sitting there scrolling looking at sites he has since well before *2018* allowing you to think that, upset me. Then the next Are we ok, etc I said like I said, yes. If I had a problem with something you said, I would've told you. Being separated, what he did, then all came and I tried to it vague and quiet as I don't want that spoken around Littles, saying she needs to talk to him about it, and changing the subject. She says we should go meet for coffee sometime and I said I'd only do it with him there, it's his thing, and if she wants information about before during or after it should be from him. How the incidents above contributed to this and that way we are all on the same page, and then joked how meets never happen so she shouldn't worry if her and I don't. Looking back I was never actually asked how I was, how I felt, nothing. 

They leave and HB had texted ""mum and dad are on their way I saw it too late"". Yea. We had talks once home in how what used to hurt was his lack of trying. He didn't attempt to reply and say no I'm at work, no it's not a good time, no the new flooring is being laid, etc. It took a few days and he had to find external validation elsewhere that sending a text to both asking for them to please ensure he is home before coming as he saw and heard how chaotic it was, two young dogs, young kids, is alot for one person which his dad has seen every visit how excitable the dogs are to see him. It's too much for me. And tbh half the time FIL randomly turns up, especially since May, he's then surprised when I say HB at work, talks surface for a bit then leaves. 

After a few days of him mulling it over, reading up how it's perfectly ok, acceptable, reasonable and normal a ask or expectation. He texts both, says he saw and heard on the door cam how chaotic again it was unprepared, and is sorry he didn't try to stop them as it wasn't a good time. Could they please make sure he is home before coming as it's too much for one person. They saw how excitable they all get again, and if they're coming to see him, then to please check first. The first time he's ever really stood for us, like try a reasonable request/boundary.

Week or so into Nov, MIL texts him for our anniversary. He light heartedly reminds her he told her back in Feb we separated but thanks anyway. She responds that she wants to ""meet for coffee, she wants him to let her in , to talk to her"". This upset him as he did that Feb, and seemingly nothing changed or was remembered. He has never been a coffee meet person, he's never had that type of relationship (despite trying) with any of MIL/SILs. They do it frequently, talk daily, holidays, with and without FIL etc. He used to put it down to ""girls day/trip, SILs just closer"" and once Littles came and the difference in treated between nibling and ours, hurt him. It wasn't a girls together thing. Just him. Then his wife. Then his kids. We accepted it and moved on. He tried Feb and now he doesn't want some one on one, spilling his heart to then be ignored, arranged and cancelled on, kids seen 1-3 times a year but there's no interest in any of our lives and he's past it. And I don't blame him. 

Then FIL texts somewhat passive aggressively asking if he can come on X day to bring Little 2 gifts. HB says yes X is good. Visit happens, was just FIL that came and he brings MIL gifts with him. HB says oh, ok. Nothing is said and it seems somewhat normal after that. It's normal for her to bail for and on any reason to visit him/us/kids.

Nearing two weeks ago now, MIL texts him one evening. She still wants to meet for coffee. He replies between work and appointments he's been busy, he's only day off was the next day and he has things arranged he can't cancel so he can't. She asks if she should pass the kids Xmas presents to FIL and he replied that she should come with dad. She responds with a photo of a Xmas decoration he made when he was 6 or 7. He showed me and said he sees it. That it was like a play out of similar stories we had both read on subs like this. Was it for guilt and sympathy for him saying he wouldn't cancel his appointments less that 24hrs prior? I dunno. My NM never had done that as nothing was ever worth saving if it didn't benefit her. She had and has nothing of any of us. It was weird seeing it with our own eyes. He has started reading more himself to see if she too may be npd as we only had experience of my NM who is different, she's Queen, self serving Waif, vicious. So this was new. 

The next day, mid morning he goes silent. Texting away. SIL 1 has started sending texts attacking, name calling, and it's just texts/responses saying he should be ashamed, he has ignored his mum for weeks, that they ""all stood by you AND *WIFE* since the start of that relationship"". He replied saying where is this coming from as this ain't just not wanting to cancel to meet to talk about his separation, again, on his one day off. But it's just the same. He says all he asked for was to check he's home and couldn't cancel stuff on his one day off, and now all this. It didn't make sense. 


She continued and said if we were separated then his family deserved to have been told (they were, to their face and text several times). If we were then he should NOT be living here (why? It's ok for his parents to holiday together when divorced and she's remarried, frequent contact, family holidays, family days out (all without him/us) but he can't live with his two young being assessed kids?). Him and I are XYZ for how we have treated his parents. How dare we ""dictate when someone can come to our house. How dare ignore MIL for weeks, if ore both mum and dad and ill treat them all year. Disgusting the upset we've caused them all year"" that he makes it seem like he's a pushover and I'm his puppet master. How dare he. How dare I. - every text had something about me. Like honestly wtf?. You'd think he had chosen to date some felon. Stand by me, by us? What?! Like where on earth was all this coming from. But apparently his mum was spending the morning crying on their shoulders, again, about being ignored, not involved, I'll treated and not allowed to be part of her grandkids and yet they've ""stood by him being with me"". What. The. F. We were both so confused and ill give him his dues, he handled and responded well. Calm. Didn't argue. I later saw it all. 

He had SIL 2 message saying she didn't want to get involved but with how upset mum was, she knows he has problems at home but he needs to sort his ####. He doesn't respond to that. 

He ends the texting with SIL 1 again asking what this really is about and what she means. He sent screenshots of last and this month of work. Proof of appointments. Basically tried defending himself and said for my name to be brought straight in then she needs to explain wtf. I had nothing to do with whether he cancels his appointment to meet his mum for coffee on his day off. I never have. And to say from the start is weird. Thats 15 years. She doesn't address any of it except I'm either typing, telling him what to say if so ""hi (my name!"". But ""they've stood by us, he isn't getting pity and to sort his ###. ""

He was so confused. It's the first time it's blown up like this. I looked at the texts and he responded calmly, he didn't name call, argue, accuse etc so the therapy and reading is doing something. Normally he'd just be so sad he might have upset his mum even minimally, he'd cave, apologise, before he did anything etc. But he literally did nothing wrong. He said he couldn't cancel his appointment and it was the only day off for like two weeks. And I told him that. 

He took time to try to write ""with love and respect, What's going on?"" Message to his mum. He says he has received nasty texts, texts that are wrong about his home life, accusing him and me of upsetting her, and how SIL kept talking about standing by us and he is asking, with love and respect, where this is coming from as this is not about him being busy on his one day off to talk about his separation and behaviour again. 

His mum replied saying she is very upset and offended that he said she didn't love me/wife (he didn't say that?), that she does NOT want to know his dirty laundry (but that was the whole reason she wanted the meet?) and all she wants is to be involved in his and the children's lives (she wanted to him and him alone? He's 99% said yes to arranged visits from her as he knows she cancels either day of or the night before. It always been like that). 


The next morning the nibling then messages him. ""I won't argue and call names, you probably don't have my number or will reply, I don't know what's going on but xyz"". Now, my NM? Never in a million years would she talk to my or siblings older kids. Never get them to text someone. She might be ill mentally but she knows our kids are off limits. So that really annoyed and upset both of us. You don't get kids involved. Of course he has her number, they've texted plenty and they are all very vocal and social on the group chat. Makes you wonder what had been said esp when nibling is largely away at college. 

He spent the rest of the day and the next preparing a full cards on the table letter/message, hoping she'd would finally say what is going on. What is it that they've apparently had against me this whole time. He said he wanted to feel heard and if he can learn to be honest, take accountability, and ask the tough questions he might not like the answer to, he needs to finally do the same with his mum. 

However after the nibling text, he said there's no choice, it has to be sent now so he added a paragraph to his text and sent it. I saw it. It was again calm, and said how she kept saying she wants him to be open and honest and this is him coming to his mum to find out what's really causing this. Being too busy to meet for coffee in a matter of weeks when it's not something they do, to end with him being verbally attacked is extreme. To be accused of xyz when it isn't true. He basically goes through all the above concerning him and the In Laws the past year as well as historically. He says the way SIL started and kept on about standing by me ""from the start"" means that there's been hidden feelings and he is asking for clarity. At the start he was renting a room, low pay, etc. I earnt more, I had my own home. But I had a kid, was that it? I had a mum that wasn't the best and I cut contact so was that the reason? 

He has arranged visits and she's cancelled. They never saw each bar 2-3 times a year and he accepted that. He did coffee once and explained we were separated and why back in Feb and he didn't want to do it again when it's so limiting to only mid morning. He cannot do it between shifts. He cannot do that and then go happily to appointments or interact fully with the kids because it's draining. He needs the day to decompress after just like she probably does and he told her he had these appointments for weeks and one day off in this pattern. Something was making them all feel a way and he is coming to her to ask what. 

I had HB include a message from me. I told her this is a repeat of my NPD mother's behavior. I told her if the family is so offended by us co-parenting, they can pay the £650 divorce fee or give him a spare room. I’ve been ""family"" for 15 years, but now they claim they’ve been ""standing by me""? Standing by me for what? Having a son? Being stable? Holding him to account to be better for his kids? They agreed cutting contact with NM was best due to her views and behavior aroundy kids so how is this any different. That's I was never in control of who he saw when and I aint now but I won't ve surprised if he steps back too after their behavior.


He said the fact he himself told her to her face in Feb we were separated, said it again in text on anniversary date, I said in person on surprise visit - she wanted to meet to discuss it as though is was new information, SIL.knew. why say that and for SIL to say he shouldn't live with his children was hurtful and confusing. For her to now say she didn't want to discuss his ""dirty laundry"" was upsetting and now even more confusing with what's happened. It doesn't make sense even more so as that was the whole purpose. He said he knows this would be shared amongst them including FIL and why it addresses all points as he does not know why these things are being said. He ended it by saying that having nibling now message too just confirms this is much deeper than a repeat of Feb, which he didn't want to do anyway, and is unacceptable to not only be attacked, accused, name called, I was too, she wouldn't say why only things untrue so he's asking her where this is rooted from. And now involving and having nibling message proves it runs deep, but isn't right and for some reason has come to the surface now, but he cannot do anything until he knows why. That this is all his words, his feelings, coming with calm, love and respect. But if any of them thought this was the way to resolve any issues any of them feel, even if that hasn't been the case as shown by previous texts, then it hasn't. At all. 


Three days later, his mum texts. Day after that SIL 1. He was back at work so didn't look. He tried to post himself but it wasn't the right sub and got no response so I said I might. Usually I may comment rarely but I don't think I've posted before as I've had forty years to learn and then start to heal from NM. But this? This SO out of my, let alone his, understanding of ... Wtf. But he looked yesterday morning and then told me last night. MIL said it was a lot to take in and she's sorry he feels that way. SIL said she apologised for the way she did it but she stands by everything she said, that she knows I was behind most of those texts, they have all stood by me since the start including during his ""sh@#y behavior” and standa by every word. Neither answered why or where or what. 

Like, is MIL some covert this whole time and it's just been one long dance? Is that how coverts work? NM is uNPD and it's clear (that's a book itself) so I don't know. Since it happened We've been looking back at things with a new lense. It's been eye opening. As it stands his guilt is deep, his sadness about it high but he says he feels relieved he's got things off his chest, lighter.  He wishes it didn't come to this but he doesn't want to contact them right now. He wants them to answer his questions before he'll do any talk, meet and especially before our kids are brought into it as it isn't like they have a relationship with any bar FIL. He says it's not rug sweeping but with Xmas a few days away and work being as busy as it is in this season, he doesn't want to pacify people anymore for peace of others. ""If I have to learn to be better for my children, they should too"". 

Hes heard nothing from his dad. No checking he is ok, nothing to say he's heard what's happened and the hundreds of visits to us this year has not been a problem. Nothing. Silence. And it hurts him deep. He's read about enablers, but it hurts to see that even after nearly three decades after divorce, FIL still chose to not be a part of upset, to agree by submission, than protect one of the kids when something wrong happens which is provable (texts) for a parents' over emotions. HB has said for years FIL has always been like this. But this being so obvious has hurt him. 

I will be showing HB this at some point. He may even reply or feel comfortable posting now or in the future as I keep validating that he hasn't done anything wrong. My mother texted FIL wanting the baby rabies and they agreed that unless you can have a relationship with the parents/s you don't get one with the kids just so you can tell people you're some great nanny and this isn't different just because the players changed. MiL has always made such a song and dance of seeing him yet hardly ever follows through but when he says he can't? This happens. So with Xmas if there is a rug swept request to come see them for visit two of the year for MIL and or SIL, he's going to tell them this. 

Have I just not seen this coming ""from the start""? This is no different to my own family but laced in false niceness. To get involved to the next generation with his nibling is beyond what I feel is acceptable for me. That's wrong. I'm sure I'm not alone hitting this point in my life trying to ensure we don't display behaviour that would leave our kids to become ourselves. Am I / we reading too much into this? 

I've told him after the second time MIL did the whole ""does she hate me"" that he can arrange MIL visits whenever but I go out. I KNOW she's going to bring it up along with what I found. He knew it but hoped she wouldn't. She did. When they knew he wasn't here (his car wasn't here so neither is he). But now? I said I don't want MIL or SIL in my house. And I won't have littles taken there. If someone can't treat all three kids the same they can't access any. If my sibling wanted to take little as Nnan keeps wanting to meet them ""before she dies"" or NM, he'd have a problem with that, with them being used to placate people who treat me bad, talk badly about me, and they'd see and hear  that. If anyone adult wants comfort, to talk matters like that and has no problem doing it in front of them then this burden I've somehow been willing no doubt be vocal now too. 

His dad? We don't know what to expect. He may text to come. He may drop off gifts. He may try to play it normal and invite him/us or just him and littles to boxing day. He may just continue to stand behind them and give silence until they get HB bowing to apologise for something we don't know. And he doesn't know how to approach those.

Ah, nothing says “ Serie A commitment” like playing a crucial 24th-round match in Perth, Australia—because why not? AC Milan and Como are locked in a bureaucratic tango with the Asian Football Confederation, while Como’s president implores fans to “make a small effort” to fly halfway across the world. Spoiler: The “small effort” involves saving for a passport, a suitcase, and maybe a small kidney. Meanwhile, CONI (Italy’s Olympic Committee) is reportedly “perplexed,” which is just a fancy way of saying “we’re all confused and slightly embarrassed.” If this happens, expect a 50/50 crowd of fans and confused locals wondering if it’s a soccer match or a lost *Lord of the Rings* scene.  

**Table Football World Championship: Messina’s Moment to Shine**  
Italy is hosting the World Champions League of *table* football (calcio balilla) in Messina, because apparently, we’re not done with football-related events until we’ve shrunk the pitch to fit a coffee table. Over 500 athletes will battle across 68 tables, competing in categories like “Senior O50” (because aging gracefully is a sport now) and “Wheelchair,” which is a heartwarming first for inclusivity. Sicily, once known for mafia movies and gelato, is now a global hub for… miniature soccer? The economic impact? Unspecified. The media attention? Probably limited to people Googling “what is calcio balilla?” and crying.  

**Transfer Market: More Drama Than a Neapolitan Opera**  
The Italian transfer market update reads like a soap opera written by a spreadsheet. Saval Maddalena’s midfield now includes “Giorgio Munaro” and “Amin Mohammed El Barad,” while Tregnago’s new trio of “Samuele Mattoccia, Manuel Gugole, and Alberto Saggioro” sounds like a group of guys who just want to be best friends. Meanwhile, 2004-born attacker Mattia Chieppe is desperately seeking a club, because nothing says “career revival” like being 21 and still job-hunting. The Faccioli twins’ move to Gargagnago is the most wholesome transfer since breadsticks were invented.  

**Juventus vs. Roma: A Masterclass in “We’ll Win, You’ll Cry”**  
Juventus extended their winning streak to three games by defeating Roma 2-1, because apparently, Roma’s xG of 1.53 is just a suggestion. Lois Openda’s first Serie A goal was a tap-in—because even when you’re not trying, Juventus still wins. Kenan Yildiz, the Swiss Army knife of midfielders, created two chances, won seven duels, and intercepted passes like a detective in a hurry. Roma, meanwhile, registered 14 shots but managed to look less threatening than a toddler with a water gun. Juventus is now “within one point of the top four,” which is code for “we’re still not done flexing.”  

**Serie A’s Apology: DAZN Subs and Free Tickets—Because Nothing Says ‘Sorry’ Like Streaming**  
After 130 fans were detained at Naples Airport due to flight-documentation chaos post-Supercoppa, Serie A issued a statement of “shock” and offered full refunds, a year of DAZN, and a free home game ticket. Because nothing soothes a fan’s trauma like being forced to watch replays of their team’s losses on a streaming service. The League also claims it’s not responsible, which is the same defense used by a toddler who knocked over a tower of blocks. Bonus points for the 11-hour mandatory rest period for flight crew—because nothing says “customer service” like leaving fans stranded while pilots nap.  

**In Summary:**  
Italy’s football world is a chaotic blend of geographical absurdity, table-top sports, and transfer-market melodrama, all held together by Juventus’ relentless winning and Serie A’s ability to turn a simple match into a bureaucratic nightmare. If this were a movie, it’d be titled *“Forza Italia: The Musical.”*",1,1766319240.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

New project gets started, and then like 2-3 hours get wasted on notification stuff. Same thing every time.

Discord webhook needs to be set up for signups. Slack gets added for subscriptions. Telegram for payments because I like getting that buzz on my phone right away. Email for anything that's actually serious.

Telegram's probably my favorite for the important stuff at this point. When someone subscribes especially. Not gonna lie that notification sound might be a bit addictive lol. There's just something about ""New Pro subscriber: $29/mo"" popping up while coffee's being grabbed that I don't know. It's weirdly satisfying I guess.

Anyway none of this is hard really. Just kind of tedious? Like Discord wants everything wrapped in embeds which is fine but I always forget the format. Slack has its own thing going on with blocks or whatever. Telegram requires that whole BotFather setup that I have to google every single time apparently. And I keep telling myself the code from the last project will just get copied over. Then an hour goes by and I'm still confused about why stuff's broken.

Been thinking about maybe just building something simple for this. Like:

    notify.send({
      event: ""user_signed_up"",
      data: { email: ""john@example.com"", plan: ""pro"" },
      channels: [""discord"", ""slack"", ""telegram"", ""email""]
    })

One call and channels get picked and formatting gets handled automatically. Each platform has its own quirks that would just be dealt with. Stripe webhook templates would probably be thrown in too since that's most of what notifications are even being sent about for me anyway.

But idk. Before this actually gets built:

* Would you actually pay \~$9/mo or just keep copy-pasting code?
* What channels do you care about most?
* Anything that would make this a no-brainer over doing it yourself?

Honestly might just be me trying to avoid copy pasting code again. Not sure if this is even a real problem or what.",2,1766319081.0,seeknwander,2,1.0,False

Sorry, this will  be long but I feel some relevant back story is needed for context. We need advice, guidance, solidarity.... I don't know. It's a new situation I've found myself in that's similar but different to the history of NPD I've known from my own NM. With Xmas a few days away, it can either kick off again, or rug sweep, or whatever other way and I need to know my / our new boundaries is right. 


Usually I read and lurk. It's helped immensely over the years. But a recent situation with the in laws has me and husband (HB) wondering wtf.


My mother is uNPD, and around 10-12 years ago it was suggested BPD (more histonic, but definitely Queen/Waif). My grandmother seems along those lines. I've been NC with NM for 3 years now. Middle sibling is NC with NM too for several years, youngest is low contact. We seem the rarer kind of just ignored of NC. There's no chasing, no forced monkeys, nothing. 



The players who I'll keep vague-ish are myself (hitting 40). Husband (HB, late 30s, got together 15 yrs ish, married 13, separated but cohabiting since beginning of year). I have my eldest, now adult, then together there is two under five (Little 1 and Little 2). 
There's his parents, FIL and MIL (early 60s) separated well over 20 years but very close, daily talks, frequent holidays, visits etc. SIL 1 is couple years older than HB. Has a near adult child. SIL 2 adult, 10-15 yrs junior from MIL second / current marriage. 


Before we got together he'd only ever see MIL at Xmas or if they did a family occasion. After we lived together and before we had Littles, MIL would drive past our home to visit SIL 1 and or FIL and just not stop to say hi. We lived several streets away from both, in the middle of their homes. Didn't bother him but he said he was used to it. Then Little 1 came and it went from seeing the females of the family 4-6 times a year at most instead of maybe 2 times. 

Then HB changed. He started displaying behavior that reminded me of my NM. Selfishness. Always the victim. Shift blaming and gas lighting. He would instantly go into defence mode and react. By then I had already fallen pregnant with Little 2. I was still dealing with my NM at this point. I am the eldest. The therapist. The scapegoat. The one who parented my siblings and her. The straw was an ""accident"" that caused Little 1 a known allergy reaction and a comment on the cause of a certain SEN - she didn't even bother with a ""not X/eldest"" to bait a reaction. I texted saying I had too much going on and needed distance, including from her. End 2023.

Little 2 born. (All healthy and fine now). HB gets worse. SiL 1 keeps saying I should be open and honest with her about it and kept saying I'm ""family"". So beginning of 2024 I do, I text somewhat frequently and at times she speaks with him. He starts therapy. We all try to find the cause in this switch. He would see it afterwards but just react the moment anything would push him into defence mode. I told him I wouldn't have it around the children so he needed to figure out where and why this was coming from as it was only towards me.

 A few times during 2023/2024, MIL would offer to come or meet up, and it got to the point he'd say *I* would be uncomfortable with it, or I wouldn't want to etc. I was never asked and actually pushed him to go mingle with family and friends. He never had a close relationship with MIL/SIL and he certainly didn't want one now. In Laws always seemed to have the family trait of rug sweeping, avoiding conflict, etc but instead of just saying he didn't want to, my name was dropped. Afterwards he'd always tell them I didn't say that and he doesn't know why he said that.  

On having Little 2 and this behaviour, at the end of 2023 I drop the rope of taking his responsibilities re In Laws. Birthdays, Xmas, etc I now had two littles with health needs, my own auto immune condition flared (we now know a second started). I wouldnt chase contact. I wouldn't be the responsible one for his side for it. I wouldnt buy and make hampers and go buy and drop off cakes. If I'm picking up his slack at home he could deal with his own family. I didn't have capacity to. I'd still be me and interact, attend, talk but my mental load was full. I had just gone no contact with NM and needed to deal. He was fine with this and of course meant it never happened lol. 


End of 2024 MIL came for a chat we requested, which I think was the total of third and last visit for 2024. All three sat and I went through his behavior he had already told her. I asked if there was signs of some kind of neurodivergence as a child, maybe that's something we can look into. I wanted to talk to her as I did not accept this behaviour for myself especially for my children, we both wanted to see if there was a reason why, apparently. Yes some looked like NM sliver but my ND eldest can come across the same and maybe the responsibility of having to grow up now he had two littles kids meant the masking stopped? I just wanted to see if this was a life thing or a recent thing. 


She said no nothing, he was just like her, crap with money, hates feeling bad. (Side info, late 2018 me and HB had a tragic situation out of our control.) Then she said that where I had a trauma childhood (she doesn't know the half of it so wtf), I have a ""thicker skin"" whereas HB didn't so the 2018 event was harder on him, he didn't get enough help (neither did really) and when Little 2 was born it set it off. I just said ""right."". She would always excuse it so just accepted and stopped. He scrolled the whole time two feet away. We had a discussion after how the whole purpose was to talk to his mum and he didn't bother. That id tried.  It started before Little 2, they knew this. I was upset as he let her use that as an excuse and not take accountability or remind her it started before. He didn't want to upset her to her face. So he let her. I said he needed to get more therapy and as far as I was concerned I wanted to separate. 

I later found out in a conversation about a visit shortly after that where he said I'd be uncomfortable due to her comment of excusing his behaviour what happened to us in 2018. That caused an argument. He said he didn't understand why he said it as he knew it wasn't true and would tell MIL this, but she was upset and kept asking so he agreed.



New years I found the truth. For many years he had an online addiction that escalated to dating sites. I told him I knew. The dates on sites visits matched to events of behaviour. And it started before 2018 so that as I thought, it all had *nothing* to do with it. We talked. Alot. He said he felt shame. I said he knew this all along and hadn't been honest with anyone, not me, them or therapists. How did he expect to address something he hid? He signed up for specific therapy. I told SIL 1 with proof. I told her she deserved to know as did his mother. That I told him he should meet them for coffee as to allow them to believe excuses when he knew the truth, wasn't fair and the first step in any progress is being honest and taking accountability. I told her I had left the ""family chat"" as I had already withdrawn socially the past year due to everything and now we were separated, he needed to explain things. Not me feeling uncomfortable when I'm asked if I'm good and I say no. I won't and can't pretend, I'm dropping the rope, he can deal with his family but I wasn't stepping away just back. He can explain why we are separated now if anyone asks, his family, his responsibility. Like me with mine. She said she understood. That was Jan 2025. 


I had slowed contact with SIL mid 2024 and stopped end 2024, it felt like she would wave her finger and tut to the behaviour and or him but nothing actually meaningful. There was no coffee meets, no visits, no help with talking to either really, very surface level. In Feb 2014 Little 1 needed urgent medical so she came at 10pm to sit with other so we could take her in until 6am I think. I don't think we actually saw her at all for 2024 after that. 

Noone wanted to visit despite many offers, none wanted to actually do as they said they would by being closer to him us or our kids. So after Jan 2025 I just haven't reached out to any of them. I told him he needed to meet them and be honest but I was done. He can deal with visits, contact etc.


Between Dec 24 and Feb 25, In calls to arrange, MIL would again bring up whether I'd be comfortable with her coming and every time he'd say he has already explained many times she did not make me uncomfortable, I had no problem with any of them nor anyone coming, I've always encouraged it due to lack of grandparents my side. (I would bite my tongue if/when something happens/said or the huge difference in treatment to him/our kids as I didn't want to be the problem when he was the one most hurt. 

After new year, He said he understands and agrees why, and will try to meet his mum for coffee as he agrees anything like that should not be round Littles. A full cards on table of his online addiction causing his poor behaviour and either lying, glossing over or just flat out scapegoating me to MIL so he wasn't ""the bad guy"" to her. 


Feb 2025 he met MIL. After he started to tell her, she said SIL already told her. She praises his honesty and she wants to be a bigger part of his life and to help. She asked if I was still uncomfortable with the excuse she gave for him Nov 2024. He said he told her several times before then she didn't, explained I was upset with him when especially now it's proven it had nothing to do with it. He told me he had to say a couple of times I have never and don't hold ill will towards her and reiterated how it was him that caused it by feeling on the spot, worried about upsetting her so used me as the excuse and he apologised again, asking if she finally understands and will stop asking. She says yes. He said if at any point she wants to talk to me about it, the separation, etc then not around the kids. It has to be when the kids are not around so if we went for coffee or something. She said she understands and agrees that's best for them. (Remember this part).

Weeks later we were told that after that coffee meet, days later she had to be rushed to hospital as she thought she was having a heart attack. Bad knees (hence excitable big dogs not good). She doesn't like to drive past lunchtime as it gets busy hence any visits were always mid morning and short and needed to be planned. (Works shifts and travels ok for that). ""Wears her heart on her sleeve"" emotional person. They didn't need to use the words he caused it for it be felt that. It turned out to be her anxiety. He told me how she's always been overly emotional and that's why no one ever wants to upset her for her reaction - I actually said he needs to sit and think of who that reminds him of. Maybe that was an angle to bring up in therapy as a learnt technique to avoid confrontation and accountability. He fully agreed it was possible.

Since then we have had at least 5-6 occasions, as per normal since the littles came, where MIL arranged to visit and then cancels within 24 hrs of coming. The last few she didn't even bother with the excuse to say she was having ""sniffles"" and if he asked if she's ok and she just said yes but plans have changed, last attempt in August. That point he said he can't be bothered with chasing the same treatment of him, me and the kids. 

Side note - For years when she would come or when he would speak to SIL or MIL, or we met at Xmas,  a day out, a visit, a meet was offered for largely me but sometimes all of us to join. He / I agreed it would be fun. He'd then see on social media it went ahead without us/me. It didn't bother me (remember I'm ""thick skinned"" 🙄) but it upset him. He told MIL once or twice on the next offer this but nothing changed. He never understood why not only he wasn't treated differently to siblings but me and our children too. He and I had noticed a switch in 2024 towards me beginning of 2024 where on the odd occasion his mum would visit, I'd start talking and she would just turn to him and start a different conversation looking back this is when I then became his reason. Still no excuse. 

FIL still dropped by randomly through out the year. Nothing was ever brought up but they all just avoid creating conflict or upset. We cohabited and yes a shoddy husband but Littles needs just can't be done by one person all the time and he's a good father. The cause coming to light has meant real work started and change happens. We worked well together for over a decade and have this year focusing on kids first. This year he has learnt alot. Grown a lot. He also recognised he was acting like a mix of my own mother and his. This year has been calmer with shared goals, there's been no online searching of ego boosting validation from others (I did check randomly). With visits from FIL (no one else bothers) we appear normal. We weren't touchy before so on the outside it hasn't changed that much, but I found my strength, my voice and myself this year. So ie spoiler alert - no ""problems at home"" and certainly, none that was told or seen of to/by any In Law lol. 

But apart from a fleeting passing by stop while FIL drove spring time, that's it for this year of me or kids seeing SIL 1 since Feb 2024, contact since Jan. That and a funeral late Spring for HB. No other contact. MIL been here once in summer (plus last month) since Nov last year.  Last month was the first time I spoke to her since Nov 2024. He hasn't spoken to them really since Feb unless it was MIL arranging/canceling. If FIL had been told, his visits weren't any different. But both of us noticed a switch around May time. He would only talk family personal or financial with HB when I left the room or they were alone otherwise it felt very surface like I was an outsider. So we believed he had been told and I said to HB that's fine. It's ok if they don't expect us to remain open between ourselves despite the closer of his parents. We'd probably get the same from everyone as that's normal after separation. 


End August 2025 FIL comes as he received a midnight text from NM. First type of any contact to or for/against me since NC started. She said she had learnt we had had another baby (she knew three years prior, I told her and along the way, had minimal knowledge via sibling). She said I cut contact as she went on holiday (she wen on several every year so why would that matter lol). She wanted FIL to ""ask HB why she hasn't held baby. Why. "" I told him to ignore it. By that point she would've been at least 2-3 cans in and probably someone at work had a kid and she needed someone to feel sorry for her. We all three agreed we knew it was lies, exaggeration, being a victim and wanting sympathy. She was just trying to triangulate me and even HB now from his dad. I thanked him to telling us and giving us all a laugh. HB asked if she had messaged MIL too and he said as far as he knew, no. 

Now bare in mind that several times throughout the year, every year, he sends everyone his shift pattern. 

*Beginning of the End*
End October MIL and FIL suddenly turns up to bring Little 1 gifts. I had the dogs in the utility, all the toys and lounge stuff in the kitchen and the lounge floor pulled up, half way through laying the underlay. Dogs start going mad (young and excitable), Little 1 does the normal shy hide and quiet, Little 2 goes running round the room excited. Chaos. All later heard  by HB on the doorbell camera. They say ""not a good time? Haha"" and I say no not really. I'm told they won't be long. I had to move part of the new flooring to part open the door, FIL had to squeeze through, move more to open etc all while the dogs busted into and through the kitchen, then into lounge all excited and FIL gets mad, I'm losing my shizzle trying to control everything. I had to get eldest to come down and go sit in the garden with the dogs (Which is also unfair). 

At the start, end and twice in-between MIL asked if me and her were ok, was I mad at her, did she upset me. The first time I said no, like he told you back in Feb your comment didn't upset me. Him sitting there scrolling looking at sites he has since well before *2018* allowing you to think that, upset me. Then the next Are we ok, etc I said like I said, yes. If I had a problem with something you said, I would've told you. Being separated, what he did, then all came and I tried to it vague and quiet as I don't want that spoken around Littles, saying she needs to talk to him about it, and changing the subject. She says we should go meet for coffee sometime and I said I'd only do it with him there, it's his thing, and if she wants information about before during or after it should be from him. How the two incidents above contributed to this and that way we are all on the same page, and then joked how meets never happen so she shouldn't worry if her and I don't. 

They leave and HB had texted ""mum and dad are on their way I saw it too late"". Yea. We had talks once home in how what used to hurt was his lack of trying. He didn't attempt to reply and say no I'm at work, no it's not a good time, no the new flooring is being laid, etc. It took a few days and he had to find external validation elsewhere that sending a text to both asking for them to please ensure he is home before coming as he saw and heard how chaotic it was, two young dogs, young kids, is alot for one person which his dad has seen every visit how excitable the dogs are to see him. It's too much for me. And tbh half the time FIL randomly turns up, especially since May, he's  then surprised when I say HB at work, talks surface for a bit then leaves. 

After a few days of him mulling it over, reading up how it's perfectly ok, acceptable, reasonable and normal a ask or expectation. He texts both, says he saw and heard on the door cam how chaotic again it was unprepared, and is sorry he didn't try to stop them as it wasn't a good time. Could they please make sure he is home before coming as it's too much for one person. They saw how excitable they all get again, and if they're coming to see him, then to please check first. The first time he's ever really stood for us, like try a reasonable request/boundary. 

Week or so into Nov, MIL texts him for our anniversary. He light heartedly reminds her he told her back in Feb we separated but thanks anyway. She responds that she wants to ""meet for coffee, she wants him to let her in , to talk to her"". This upset him as he did that Feb, and seemingly nothing changed or was remembered. He has never been a coffee meet person, he's never had that type of relationship (despite trying) with any of MIL/SILs. They do it frequently, talk daily, holidays, with and without FIL etc. He used to put it down to ""girls day/trip, SILs just closer"" and once Littles came and the difference in treated between nibling and ours, hurt him. It wasn't a girls together thing. Just him. Then his wife. Then his kids. We accepted it and moved on. He tried Feb and now he doesn't want some one on one, spilling his heart to then be ignored, arranged and cancelled on, kids seen 1-3 times a year but there's no interest in any of our lives and he's past it. And I don't blame him. 

Then FIL texts somewhat passive aggressively asking if he can come on X day to bring Little 2 gifts. HB says yes X is good. Visit happens, was just FIL that came and he brings MIL gifts with him. HB says oh, ok. Nothing is said and it seems somewhat normal after that. It's normal for her to bail for and on any reason to visit him/us/kids.

Nearing two weeks ago now, MIL texts him one evening. She still wants to meet for coffee. He replies between work and appointments he's been busy, he's only day off was the next day and he has things arranged he can't cancel so he can't. She asks if she should pass the kids Xmas presents to FIL and he replied that she should come with dad. She responds with a photo of a Xmas decoration he made when he was 6 or 7. He showed me and said he sees it. That it was like a play out of similar stories we had both read on subs like this. Was it for guilt and sympathy for him saying he wouldn't cancel his appointments less that 24hrs prior? I dunno. My NM never had done that as nothing was ever worth saving if it didn't benefit her. She had and has nothing of any of us. It was weird seeing it with our own eyes. He has started reading more himself to see if she too may be npd as we only had experience of my NM who is different, she's Queen, self serving Waif, vicious. So this was new. 

The next day, mid morning he goes silent. Texting away. SIL 1 has started sending texts attacking, name calling, and it's just texts/responses saying he should be ashamed, he has ignored his mum for weeks, that they ""all stood by you AND *WIFE* since the start of that relationship"". He replied saying where is this coming from as this ain't just not wanting to cancel to meet to talk about his separation, again, on his one day off. But it's just the same. He says all he asked for was to check he's home and couldn't cancel stuff on his one day off, and now all this. It didn't make sense. 


She continued and said if we were separated then his family deserved to have been told (they were, to their face and text several times). If we were then he should NOT be living here (why? It's ok for his parents to holiday together when divorced and she's remarried, frequent contact, family holidays, family days out (all without him/us) but he can't live with his two young being assessed kids?). Him and I are XYZ for how we have treated his parents. How dare we ""dictate when someone can come to our house. How dare ignore MIL for weeks, if ore both mum and dad and ill treat them all year. Disgusting the upset we've caused them all year"" that he makes it seem like he's a pushover and I'm his puppet master. How dare he. How dare I. - every text had something about me. Like honestly wtf?. You'd think he had chosen to date some felon. Stand by me, by us? What?! Like where on earth was all this coming from. But apparently his mum was spending the morning crying on their shoulders, again, about being ignored, not involved, I'll treated and not allowed to be part of her grandkids and yet they've ""stood by him being with me"". What. The. F. We were both so confused and ill give him his dues, he handled and responded well. Calm. Didn't argue. I later saw it all. 

He had SIL 2 message saying she didn't want to get involved but with how upset mum was, she knows he has problems at home but he needs to sort his ####. He doesn't respond to that. 

He ends the texting with SIL 1 again asking what this really is about and what she means. He sent screenshots of last and this month of work. Proof of appointments. Basically tried defending himself and said for my name to be brought straight in then she needs to explain wtf. I had nothing to do with whether he cancels his appointment to meet his mum for coffee on his day off. I never have. And to say from the start is weird. Thats 15 years. She doesn't address any of it except I'm either typing, telling him what to say if so ""hi (my name!"". But ""they've stood by us, he isn't getting pity and to sort his ###. ""

He was so confused. It's the first time it's blown up like this. I looked at the texts and he responded calmly, he didn't name call, argue, accuse etc so the therapy and reading is doing something. Normally he'd just be so sad he might have upset his mum even minimally, he'd cave, apologise, before he did anything etc. But he literally did nothing wrong. He said he couldn't cancel his appointment and it was the only day off for like two weeks. And I told him that. 

He took time to try to write ""with love and respect, What's going on?"" Message to his mum. He says he has received nasty texts, texts that are wrong about his home life, accusing him and me of upsetting her, and how SIL kept talking about standing by us and he is asking, with love and respect, where this is coming from as this is not about him being busy on his one day off to talk about his separation and behaviour again. 

His mum replied saying she is very upset and offended that he said she didn't love me/wife (he didn't say that?), that she does NOT want to know his dirty laundry (but that was the whole reason she wanted the meet?) and all she wants is to be involved in his and the children's lives (she wanted to him and him alone? He's 99% said yes to arranged visits from her as he knows she cancels either day of or the night before. It always been like that). 


The next morning the nibling then messages him. ""I won't argue and call names, you probably don't have my number or will reply, I don't know what's going on but xyz"". Now, my NM? Never in a million years would she talk to my or siblings older kids. Never get them to text someone. She might be ill mentally but she knows our kids are off limits. So that really annoyed and upset both of us. You don't get kids involved. Of course he has her number, they've texted plenty and they are all very vocal and social on the group chat. Makes you wonder what had been said esp when nibling is largely away at college. 

He spent the rest of the day and the next preparing a full cards on the table letter/message, hoping she'd would finally say what is going on. What is it that they've apparently had against me this whole time. He said he wanted to feel heard and if he can learn to be honest, take accountability, and ask the tough questions he might not like the answer to, he needs to finally do the same with his mum. 

However after the nibling text, he said there's no choice, it has to be sent now so he added a paragraph to his text and sent it. I saw it. It was again calm, and said how she kept saying she wants him to be open and honest and this is him coming to his mum to find out what's really causing this. Being too busy to meet for coffee in a matter of weeks when it's not something they do, to end with him being verbally attacked is extreme. To be accused of xyz when it isn't true. He basically goes through all the above concerning him and the In Laws the past year as well as historically. He says the way SIL started and kept on about standing by me ""from the start"" means that there's been hidden feelings and he is asking for clarity. At the start he was renting a room, low pay, etc. I earnt more, I had my own home. But I had a kid, was that it? I had a mum that wasn't the best and I cut contact so was that the reason? 

He has arranged visits and she's cancelled. They never saw each bar 2-3 times a year and he accepted that. He did coffee once and explained we were separated and why back in Feb and he didn't want to do it again when it's so limiting to only mid morning. He cannot do it between shifts. He cannot do that and then go happily to appointments or interact fully with the kids because it's draining. He needs the day to decompress after just like she probably does and he told her he had these appointments for weeks and one day off in this pattern. Something was making them all feel a way and he is coming to her to ask what. 

I had HB include a message from me. I told her this is a repeat of my NPD mother's behavior. I told her if the family is so offended by us co-parenting, they can pay the £650 divorce fee or give him a spare room. I’ve been ""family"" for 15 years, but now they claim they’ve been ""standing by me""? Standing by me for what? Having a son? Being stable? Holding him to account to be better for his kids? They agreed cutting contact with NM was best due to her views and behavior aroundy kids so how is this any different. That's I was never in control of who he saw when and I aint now but I won't ve surprised if he steps back too after their behavior.


He said the fact he himself told her to her face in Feb we were separated, said it again in text on anniversary date, I said in person on surprise visit - she wanted to meet to discuss it as though is was new information, SIL.knew. why say that and for SIL to say he shouldn't live with his children was hurtful and confusing. For her to now say she didn't want to discuss his ""dirty laundry"" was upsetting and now even more confusing with what's happened. It doesn't make sense even more so as that was the whole purpose. He said he knows this would be shared amongst them including FIL and why it addresses all points as he does not know why these things are being said. He ended it by saying that having nibling now message too just confirms this is much deeper than a repeat of Feb, which he didn't want to do anyway, and is unacceptable to not only be attacked, accused, name called, I was too, she wouldn't say why only things untrue so he's asking her where this is rooted from. And now involving and having nibling message proves it runs deep, but isn't right and for some reason has come to the surface now, but he cannot do anything until he knows why. That this is all his words, his feelings, coming with calm, love and respect. But if any of them thought this was the way to resolve any issues any of them feel, even if that hasn't been the case as shown by previous texts, then it hasn't. At all. 


Three days later, his mum texts. Day after that SIL 1. He was back at work so didn't look. He tried to post himself but it wasn't the right sub and got no response so I said I might. Usually I may comment rarely but I don't think I've posted before as I've had forty years to learn and then start to heal from NM. But this? This SO out of my, let alone his, understanding of ... Wtf. But he looked yesterday morning and then told me last night. MIL said it was a lot to take in and she's sorry he feels that way. SIL said she apologised for the way she did it but she stands by everything she said. Neither answered why or where or what. 

Like, is MIL some covert this whole time and it's just been one long dance? Is that how coverts work? NM is uNPD and it's clear (that's a book itself) so I don't know. Since it happened We've been looking back at things with a new lense. It's been eye opening. As it stands his guilt is deep, his sadness about it high but he says he feels relieved he's got things off his chest, lighter.  He wishes it didn't come to this but he doesn't want to contact them right now. He wants them to answer his questions before he'll do any talk, meet and especially before our kids are brought into it as it isn't like they have a relationship with any bar FIL. He says it's not rug sweeping but with Xmas a few days away and work being as busy as it is in this season, he doesn't want to pacify people anymore for peace of others. ""If I have to learn to be better for my children, they should too"". 

Hes heard nothing from his dad. No checking he is ok, nothing to say he's heard what's happened and the hundreds of visits to us this year has not been a problem. Nothing. Silence. And it hurts him deep. He's read about enablers, but it hurts to see that even after nearly three decades after divorce, FIL still chose to not be a part of upset, to agree by submission, than protect one of the kids when something wrong happens which is provable (texts) for a parents' over emotions. HB has said for years FIL has always been like this. But this being so obvious has hurt him. 

I will be showing HB this at some point. He may even reply or feel comfortable posting now or in the future as I keep validating that he hasn't done anything wrong. My mother texted FIL wanting the baby rabies and they agreed that unless you can have a relationship with the parents/s you don't get one with the kids just so you can tell people you're some great nanny and this isn't different just because the players changed. MiL has always made such a song and dance of seeing him yet hardly ever follows through but when he says he can't? This happens. So with Xmas if there is a rug swept request to come see them for visit two of the year for MIL and or SIL, he's going to tell them this. 

Have I just not seen this coming ""from the start""? This is no different to my own family but laced in false niceness. To get involved to the next generation with his nibling is beyond what I feel is acceptable for me. That's wrong. I'm sure I'm not alone hitting this point in my life trying to ensure we don't display behaviour that would leave our kids to become ourselves. Am I / we reading too much into this? 

I've told him after the second time MIL did the whole ""does she hate me"" that he can arrange MIL visits whenever but I go out. I KNOW she's going to bring it up along with what I found. He knew it but hoped she wouldn't. She did. When they knew he wasn't here (his car wasn't here so neither is he). But now? I said I don't want MIL or SIL in my house. And I won't have littles taken there. If someone can't treat all three kids the same they can't access any. If my sibling wanted to take little as Nnan keeps wanting to meet them ""before she dies"" or NM, he'd have a problem with that, with them being used to placate people who treat me bad, talk badly about me, and they'd see and hear  that. If anyone adult wants comfort, to talk matters like that and has no problem doing it in front of them then this burden I've somehow been willing no doubt be vocal now too. 

His dad? We don't know what to expect. He may text to come. He may drop off gifts. He may try to play it normal and invite him/us or just him and littles to boxing day. He may just continue to stand behind them and give silence until they get HB bowing to apologise for something we don't know. And he doesn't know how to approach those.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

I’m 22F and a first-time mum to my 9-month-old daughter. I’m looking for some reassurance and advice because lately I’ve been feeling more short-tempered than I ever have before, and it’s really worrying me.

Up until recently, I felt like I coped quite well emotionally. Over the past few weeks though, my daughter has become much more clingy and unsettled, especially with sleep. We’ve had a lot of broken nights with frequent wake-ups, crying, and very little proper rest, which has been exhausting.

I’m the one with her all day. My partner works nights, so his sleep schedule is all over the place. He does help when he’s awake, and I appreciate that, but even when he helps during the night I still struggle to get back to sleep and feel constantly drained.

Last night was particularly hard. She was waking on and off from around midnight. By about 5am she was awake properly, so we went downstairs, put some music on, and I made a coffee. My partner played with her for a bit before going back to bed. About 40 minutes later she was clearly still exhausted, so I gave her a bottle and we both went back to sleep.

About half an hour later she woke up screaming and I felt completely overwhelmed. She needed changing, so I cleaned her up, but she would not stop crying and I could feel my frustration building. Instead of snapping, I walked away briefly to calm myself down, got some Calpol, came back, and settled her.

Afterwards, my partner said that I needed to comfort her more, which really upset me. He does not see the constant comforting, reassurance, patience, and love I give her every single day. I am with her all the time. I soothe her, take her out, play with her, and meet her needs. In that moment it felt like all he saw was my frustration.

I love my daughter more than anything, and that is why these feelings scare me. I just want to know if other parents experience moments like this when they are exhausted and sleep deprived, or if this is something I should be genuinely concerned about",3,1766318750.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

New project gets started, and then like 2-3 hours get wasted on notification stuff. Same thing every time.

Discord webhook needs to be set up for signups. Slack gets added for subscriptions. Telegram for payments because I like getting that buzz on my phone right away. Email for anything that's actually serious.

Telegram's probably my favorite for the important stuff at this point. When someone subscribes especially. Not gonna lie that notification sound might be a bit addictive lol. There's just something about ""New Pro subscriber: $29/mo"" popping up while coffee's being grabbed that I don't know. It's weirdly satisfying I guess.

Anyway none of this is hard really. Just kind of tedious? Like Discord wants everything wrapped in embeds which is fine but I always forget the format. Slack has its own thing going on with blocks or whatever. Telegram requires that whole BotFather setup that I have to google every single time apparently. And I keep telling myself the code from the last project will just get copied over. Then an hour goes by and I'm still confused about why stuff's broken.

Been thinking about maybe just building something simple for this. Like:

    notify.send({
      event: ""user_signed_up"",
      data: { email: ""john@example.com"", plan: ""pro"" },
      channels: [""discord"", ""slack"", ""telegram"", ""email""]
    })

One call and channels get picked and formatting gets handled automatically. Each platform has its own quirks that would just be dealt with. Stripe webhook templates would probably be thrown in too since that's most of what notifications are even being sent about for me anyway.

But idk. Before this actually gets built:

* Would you actually pay \~$9/mo or just keep copy-pasting code?
* What channels do you care about most?
* Anything that would make this a no-brainer over doing it yourself?

Honestly might just be me trying to avoid copy pasting code again. Not sure if this is even a real problem or what.",1,1766318600.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False

Disclaimer (used some template and ai AI-generated image by Gemini based on my post)

I’m a 28 yo guy in Pune, just trying my luck one more time here. Think of it as a message in a bottle..  one that absolutely loves gym selfies and half marathons instead of seashells. If you’re a fellow CF soul who values fitness, freedom, travel, fun, a lot of things except for being typical stuff that 98% else is doing.

Let's just stick around. Maybe we could be that me and you couple... not chasing for anything perfect..

# Who am I?

* Current Base: Pune, I’m working in finance and loving the hustle. Weekends find me planning a long run, sometimes trek,  sometimes road tripping to somewhere in the outskirts or discovering a new cafe.
* Language: Hindi, Marathi and English. Communication is key, whether it’s joking around or having a deep conversation over chai.
* Nasha:  Non-smoker, social drinker....
* Lifestyle:  Hindu but atheist in practice.
* Umm:   Ambivert. Bohot jyada Extrovert if we vibe. Thoda introvert (initially)
* Career & Finance: working in finance. Financial freedom is high on my list eventually.. Right now, Financially F..
* Hobbies & Fitness: Gym is my second home, and running keeps me sane. I’ve completed two half marathons (cheers to that finish line!), and I’m eyeing a full one next. Outside the gym, I enjoy trekking, working on side projects and the occasional gaming session. Pro tip: Consistency is key. Gradually increase your mileage, mix in strength training, and stay hydrated!
* Health: I eat reasonably clean and prioritise sleep (8 hours or it’s a bad day). Weekend cheat mode: Paneer roll and Netflix marathons. Meditation and yoga are great ideas, I’m still working on, one breath at a time.
* Fur Babies: No pets right now, but I have a soft spot for dogs (and cats, if they promise not to knock over my protein shake). Maybe one day I’ll get a puppy to train on our runs. As for human kids? Nope, not on my roadmap.
* Why Childfree: Sleep, freedom, fitness and finances and raising kids costs more than a Ferrari. Also, why be a bad parent when you are not sure if you would be a good parent? I can be the best uncle. Also, I would rather pick you up from work than a baby from school.
* Partner not: Equal partnership is everything to me. We can always try to push each other up, learn from each other. Always try to level up..

# Let's make this real

* Fitness & Adventurous: A fellow health enthusiast or someone willing to start. If you can handle early morning runs or random sports games, we’re on the same page.
* Kind & Smart: A good heart and a curious mind.
* Independent & Ambitious: You’ve got your own passions and drive. Bonus points if you’re also on a CF journey and get why a kids free life is awesome.
* Spontaneous: Up for an impromptu road trip? Love trying new foods? I’m the yes type when adventure calls; hope you are too.
* Location: Based in Pune (or nearby); willing to meet up locally.

Relationship motto: Long-term and meaningful someone who is willing to try for lifestyle.. we have a lifetime to try if it doesn't work out

If you’re still reading, send me a message with your favourite running tip or Netflix recommendation. Can we have a pickleball date(never tried), Badminton or tennis, running dates or just a Coffee date?  Fitness, friends and finance, let’s build our life around those, shall we? Namaste! <3

# Before You DM

Only reach out if you want a real call and a real meetup. No long texting, no vanishing acts, no last minute “I need to focus on studies or work”. Everyone has work/ something commitment matters. If you are unsure or flaky, skip.

1ps4zoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1ps4zoq/30_day_test_vitanerve6_a_doctorformulated/,[30 Day Test] VitaNerve6 🎯 a Doctor-Formulated Supplement to Repair Nerves and Relieve Pain Naturally?,"# 😖 Welcome To Our VitaNerve6 Review ...

Nerve pain is like a roommate that never pays rent and won't shut up. It zaps, tingles, and burns its way into your day — then has the audacity to interrupt your sleep.

It’s frustrating, exhausting, and way too common. The constant discomfort doesn’t just affect your body — it messes with your mood, patience, and let’s be honest, your social life.

If you’ve tried creams, gadgets, or stretching yourself into a pretzel with no relief, maybe it’s time to try something different. Let’s talk [VitaNerve6](https://theworldhealth.org/vita-nerve-6-official).

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** VitaNerve6  
**Category:** Supplements ➝ Nerve Support  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.8/5

This isn’t just one of those random **formulas that support nerve health** sitting next to the fish oil on the shelf. It was built with purpose.

**VitaNerve6** combines ingredients known to help with nerve damage and inflammation, bringing you a **supplement that relieves nerve pain** in a more targeted way.

You’re not getting flashy marketing or gimmicks — just a clean blend that **naturally supports nerve function**.

# 🧠 What Is VitaNerve6 and Who Is It For?

This is a daily nerve health supplement made for people tired of constant tingling, burning, and that lovely sensation like ants crawling under your skin.

It's one of the **doctor-formulated supplements for nerve pain relief** that aims to improve nerve signals and help your body manage discomfort naturally.

This **supplement** may appeal to anyone dealing with **diabetic nerve pain, post-surgical issues**, or even just tired legs and persistent **tingling in the hands and feet**.

If you're considering **non-drug treatments for peripheral neuropathy**, this option lets you skip the pharmacy counter and still give your nerves a fighting chance.

# 🌿 Key Ingredients and How They Work

First up is **alpha-lipoic acid as a remedy for neuropathy**, a strong antioxidant shown to help improve nerve sensitivity and [reduce inflammation](https://theworldhealth.org/vita-nerve-6-official) over time.

Then there’s **vitamin B12 for nerve recovery** — critical for rebuilding the myelin sheath that protects nerves and keeps them working properly.

**Using turmeric to relieve nerve pain** isn't just trendy — curcumin has a long-standing reputation for calming inflammation and easing discomfort.

You'll also get acetyl-L-carnitine and **natural anti-inflammatories that help with nerve pain**, like baicalin and ginkgo, which support blood flow and repair.

This combination makes it one of the **top supplements for regenerating nerves**. These ingredients do more than soothe — they support healing deep down.

# ✋ Erin’s Experience with VitaNerve6

So, my friend Erin — a yoga teacher I met through a vegan cooking class last year — was the one who convinced me to [try VitaNerve6](https://theworldhealth.org/vita-nerve-6-official).

She’s in her late 30s, super active, but she’d been quietly dealing with burning sensations in her feet after long teaching days.

She described it as this weird “fizzing” feeling that would creep in by the evening and leave her tossing at night.

She’d already tried magnesium sprays, stretching routines, and even those funky foot massagers from Instagram. Nothing stuck.

Then she found this formula after Googling **natural solutions for neuropathy** and decided to give it a solid month.

By week two, she said the “buzz” had mellowed to a low hum, and by week four, her post-class discomfort was down enough that she wasn’t dreading long holds or barefoot sequences anymore.

The real kicker?

She actually started sleeping through the night without having to stretch or ice her feet at 3 a.m.

Her only tiny complaint was the capsule size — “chunky, but doable,” in her words — but she chased it with a protein smoothie and moved on with her day.

Hearing how much it helped her gave me the nudge I needed. I figured if a barefoot yogi teaching seven days a week could find relief, it was worth a try. And honestly, she wasn’t wrong.

1ps4yxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1ps4yxh/what_im_thinking_is_this/,What I’m thinking is this?,"What I’m wondering is this.

My Elvanse takes a long time to kick in, but once it does, I never have any problems with it wearing off too early. It lasts right through until bedtime and doesn’t affect my sleep at all. I can even have a cup of coffee before bed with no issues (although I don’t drink coffee anymore, as I just don’t seem to get on with it now).

For the first time ever, I actually took my Elvanse at around 4 a.m. this morning. I woke up briefly to use the toilet and decided to take it then, although I did worry it might disturb my sleep. It didn’t.

When I woke up properly later, I felt bright-eyed but not charged up, which made me think it may already have been working. Obviously, waking up at 4 a.m. to take medication in the middle of REM sleep isn’t practical or something I’d want to do regularly.

I’m also aware that taking it that early could potentially bring on an earlier “crash” later in the day — I’ll only know tonight whether that happens.

So my actual question is this:
Would it make sense to take Elvanse when I wake up as normal, but also have a small short-acting booster in the morning? The reason being that it sometimes takes until around 11:30 a.m. (if I take it at 6 a.m.) for Elvanse to fully kick in, and that morning lag can be difficult.

I’m just interested in people’s experiences with this, particularly whether anyone has dealt with long Elvanse onset times in a similar way.",2,1766318469.0,ADHDUK,2,1.0,False

Sometimes we get customers who completely blow up over the tiniest things, like grown adults taking out their bad day on us kids. It's ridiculous.

So James and I came up with a little scheme to deal with the worst offenders. When a customer starts raging at me or Danielle over nothing, James will come over and be like, ""Is there a problem here?""

The angry customer will rant at him, and then James will turn to me and say something like, ""OP, this is unacceptable. You're fired, effective immediately.""

I'll start fake-crying, begging him not to fire me, saying my family needs the money. James plays the hardass boss, telling me to hand over my apron and leave.

Almost every time, the angry customer starts backpedaling, like ""Whoa, it's not that serious, you don't have to fire her!"" James will insist that they pride themselves on customer service and my behavior was unacceptable.

Of course, I don't actually get fired. It's just an act to make these tantrum-throwing adults realize that their hissy fits have consequences. And it usually results in them apologizing and admitting they overreacted.

But when I told some school friends about our little prank, they said it was mean to let people think they got some poor kid fired when I desperately need the job.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I’m looking for the style to be very similar to what’s popular now with romantic novels, flat with cartoonish illustrations, vibrant imagery, etc (think the Game Changer Series art).

Since the cover would depict my friend and his boyfriend, I can share a picture of the two of them once hired. I can also provide more details of the cover scene and then provide the summary for the back. 

My budget is around $75-100. And since I’m wanting to print it as a jacket cover, I’d want it to be  high-resolution.

I forgot to turn off the heat early though because I'm filming it😅.

First, moka pot coffee should NOT taste burnt, smell burnt, or be extremely bitter. If it does, something in the process is off.

So here are some steps that helped me make better moka pot coffee

1st: Make sure the moka pot is tightly closed. If it’s not sealed properly, steam can escape. This causes uneven pressure, requires more heat from the stove, and can lead to sputtering and burnt flavors.

2nd: Don’t blindly follow heat advice find what works for your moka pot. Some people say to always use the lowest heat, others say medium heat. In reality, you need to experiment. Every stove and moka pot is different, so trial and error is the key to finding the right heat level for your setup.

3rd: Stop brewing as soon as it starts sputtering. Once the flow turns watery or starts sputtering, most of the good extraction is already done. Leaving it on the heat longer is what usually causes bitterness. Taking it off early keeps the coffee smooth.

You’ll know it’s a good brew if you can clearly taste the flavor notes of the coffee beans.",6,1766318026.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

Disclaimer (used some template and ai AI-generated image by Gemini based on my post)

I’m a 28 yo guy in Pune, just trying my luck one more time here. Think of it as a message in a bottle..  one that absolutely loves gym selfies and half marathons instead of seashells. If you’re a fellow CF soul who values fitness, freedom, travel, fun, a lot of things except for being typical stuff that 98% else is doing.

Let's just stick around. Maybe we could be that me and you couple... not chasing for anything perfect..

# Who am I?

* Current Base: Pune, I’m working in finance and loving the hustle. Weekends find me planning a long run, sometimes trek,  sometimes road tripping to somewhere in the outskirts or discovering a new cafe.
* Language: Hindi, Marathi and English. Communication is key, whether it’s joking around or having a deep conversation over chai.
* Nasha:  Non-smoker, social drinker....
* Lifestyle:  Hindu but atheist in practice. 
* Umm:   Ambivert. Bohot jyada Extrovert if we vibe. Thoda introvert (initially)
* Career & Finance: working in finance. Financial freedom is high on my list eventually.. Right now, Financially F.. 
* Hobbies & Fitness: Gym is my second home, and running keeps me sane. I’ve completed two half marathons (cheers to that finish line!), and I’m eyeing a full one next. Outside the gym, I enjoy trekking, working on side projects and the occasional gaming session. Pro tip: Consistency is key. Gradually increase your mileage, mix in strength training, and stay hydrated!
* Health: I eat reasonably clean and prioritise sleep (8 hours or it’s a bad day). Weekend cheat mode: Paneer roll and Netflix marathons. Meditation and yoga are great ideas, I’m still working on, one breath at a time. 
* Fur Babies: No pets right now, but I have a soft spot for dogs (and cats, if they promise not to knock over my protein shake). Maybe one day I’ll get a puppy to train on our runs. As for human kids? Nope, not on my roadmap.
* Why Childfree: Sleep, freedom, fitness and finances and raising kids costs more than a Ferrari. Also, why be a bad parent when you are not sure if you would be a good parent? I can be the best uncle. Also, I would rather pick you up from work than a baby from school.
* Partner not: Equal partnership is everything to me. We can always try to push each other up, learn from each other. Always try to level up.. 

# Let's make this real

* Fitness & Adventurous: A fellow health enthusiast or someone willing to start. If you can handle early morning runs or random sports games, we’re on the same page.
* Kind & Smart: A good heart and a curious mind. 
* Independent & Ambitious: You’ve got your own passions and drive. Bonus points if you’re also on a CF journey and get why a kids free life is awesome.
* Spontaneous: Up for an impromptu road trip? Love trying new foods? I’m the yes type when adventure calls; hope you are too.
* Location: Based in Pune (or nearby); willing to meet up locally. 

Relationship motto: Long-term and meaningful someone who is willing to try for lifestyle.. we have a lifetime to try if it doesn't work out

If you’re still reading, send me a message with your favourite running tip or Netflix recommendation. Can we have a pickleball date(never tried), Badminton or tennis, running dates or just a Coffee date?  Fitness, friends and finance, let’s build our life around those, shall we? Namaste! <3

# Before You DM

Only reach out if you want a real call and a real meetup. No long texting, no vanishing acts, no last-minute “I need to focus on studies or work”. Everyone has work. Commitment matters. If you are unsure or flaky, skip.

Any suggestions on things/breakfast places to eat? I’ll have my dog so for restaurants it’d have to be a place I can sit outside with him. If there’s a really great spot but doesn’t have outdoor seating, I’m open to picking up the food & eating it somewhere outside. We enjoy walking & if there’s any great local coffee shops I’d love to check that out as well. I want to make sure I’m supporting local as much as possible over chains.

Started Wegovy in late March 2025, and have lost about 1kg per three weeks since then. Gradually worked up through dosages and spent most of that time at 1mg. Got put up to 1.7 in October but experienced some (I think) unrelated sickness after my first dose that resulted in me skipping two weeks of doses. I went back down to 1.0 after that as I wanted to build back up to 1.7 (and had repeats left on my script) - haven't touched 1.7 since unfortunately.

  
On low doses I experienced basically no side effects except for nausea if I ate something too sugary sweet, too deep fried fatty or too close to bed - all things I wanted to avoid doing, so I was grateful to the nausea for making me rethink my life choices. 

  
For most of the time I've been on 1.0 or higher I have had common side effects including increased frequency of nausea, constipation, and a fairly common metallic taste in my mouth. I've also had other health issues going on that may or may not be related (but could just as easily be attributed to other parts of life) - fatigue, dizziness, heart palpitations, just a general sense of unwellness. 

  
Food is my only real vice. I don't drink, smoke or do any other drugs. I just like food that is comfortable, has variety and makes me feel full. Wegovy has challenged me on the foods I seek out - I would rather an apple than a sausage roll for breakfast, and I skip dessert instead of having ice cream. The constant recent metallic taste makes me prefer a cold bottle of water to a coffee which is also helping save a couple hundred calories every day. Early on it was also doing a great job at limiting my portion sizes by making me feel fuller quicker, but that has tapered off in recent months. 

  
Unfortunately I have failed to exercise properly during almost the entire time I have been on Wegovy. Being so hot after work makes it hard to get out for a walk/jog during daylight savings, and in the other months it is too dark to get out afterwards - I want to buy a recumbent bike so I can get some exercise in from home but I just haven't had the money (thanks in no small part to the cost of Wegovy!) I know I would have lost more weight (and been more optimistic to continue) if I had managed to exercise during the past nine months but alas. 

  
I guess I'm just here to yell into the void. I went into Wegovy determined to reach my gw but right now I feel like I am staring down another 12 months of being poor, feeling nauseous, intermittent constipation, and feeling like I am constantly sucking on a nickel just to even have a shot at reaching that point. I genuinely love that I have lost about 10% of my body weight in that time, and it has had a small but noticeable impact on the way I look (went down a belt size and have had a few friends comment on the fact I look like I've lost some weight) but I don't know if the juice is worth the squeeze. If anyone has overcome any similar feelings I would love to hear your stories. ",2,1766317327.0,WegovyWeightLoss,2,1.0,False

It changed who I am. It made me aware of my trauma and tore open every old wound. It was a deep trauma bond. I kinda went crazy lol. I was high most of the time. 

I always looked at people. You know, was hoping someone would notice me and choose me. Years of staring or sneaking glances at strangers hoping this time they’ll look back. After my ex dumped me I promised to never do that again. 

2 months ago uni started. I sat at a lecture completely dissociated and depressed. And I felt someone staring at me. After a while I looked and I saw this gorgeous guy looking at me. As we caught eyes he looked away nervously. I was stunned. It was so weird being on this side of things. I gaslit myself I imagined it. Throughout those two months we had a couple more small interactions like this. Not a lot, but I doubted there’s a chance he’s into me. I’m ugly, weak and weird. In my eyes anyway? But then a week ago he texted me over something ordinary but it was very obvious he was trying to start something, or it would’ve been obvious if I haven’t been so busy still gaslighting and humiliating myself in my head.

But ever since he texted me I started obsessing over him. He seems so interesting, I half stalked him on social media and felt disgusted with myself, told some friends about him and felt disgusted with myself, thought of him and fantasized and felt disgusted with myself. My friend convinced me to text him and make plans to grab a coffee at uni. I did it on auto pilot and after smoking 5 blunts I’m so fucking weird. We meet the day after tomorrow. There’s no way I’m worthy of him. And I’m a mess. I’m in active addiction, I’m dealing with my trauma, I stalk him like a weirdo, I see signs he’s into me but my body simply refuses to believe this is really happening… I’ll have to act mature and stable when we meet, and I’ll feel like a fraud… and at the same time I feel insane for even thinking about all those things, he’s a stranger why am I so worked up?

#                         Ch-8 Unmasked

#                               Part - 1



The jungle is on fire and the target is on loose. Shekhar didn’t look back after committing that 

Notorious clutch.All he did was keep driving until the fires appeared smaller.



**6 Days Later…..**

It takes place in a hospital, the eyes focus on Vijay who has been unconscious ever since that accident. He opens his eyes and finds 2 of his assistants besides him who come to him asking how he feels. Other officers get the news and come to him with flower bouquets. He was still resting and couldn’t move well.



**On the day of accident**

We now get to know what had happened after his car had turned the other day. The explosion had made the car flip upside down.The trail of cars behind Vijay’s car had stopped in panic and rushed towards his flipped over car to resume him. There was fear in every officer's face and they went to check on his car.



As the DSP went closer, what he saw was horrifying. He saw Vijay's spine fully crushed and he was lying still in the car with the glass pieces embedded in his body making his body feel like a slaughtered goat. His leg was stuck in the steering wheel where his knees made an angle of 90 degree with his thighs. His arms cracked from the other side and he laid motionless while blood dripped from his mouth.



The officers rushed inside the car breaking the door and pulled out Vijay just on time as the petrol was leaking and the fire appeared to get ferocious which would end up in explosion. Just a couple of seconds after Vijay left the car, the car turned into a flamethrower as it exploded with the most out of it.



**Present Day**

It was a calm atmosphere inside until it felt like drums beating and horns blowing from the outside. After checking, one of the officer confirms that it is Michael who was leading a Baraat(an indian celebration when groom goes to pick up the bride) with some people dancing around him and Micheal was dancing with a thick support around his leg, a neck support and shades on him while one of the guys is holding him for support.



He looks at the hospital window and smiles. The very next thing, he goes into Vijay's room and salutes him with a broken arm.Vijay feels irritated looking at him but Michael calmly goes and sits at a chair nearby.”I knew you wouldn’t die Sir”, said Michael. Vijay remains silent due to irritation. “We both missed him and the fun part is that we don’t even know where he is”, Michael continued.



“I may look like I’m all fine but I broke the Atlas of my neck bone,broke my  Tibia in the leg and my left arm”, Michael explained. He needed at least 3 months'time to fully recover and get back to work. “The doctor wants sir to rest for at least 4 months”, said his assistant. Michael got up and said,”Ok then, let's make a deal”.”Until the both of us are back on our feets nobody’s gonna touch him”,Michael made a deal. “All we do is observe,plan and prepare”,Michael continued.



“Ok”,Vijay finally spoke. “It’s a deal of the dogs then”, Michael said this before leaving. He bangs open the door with his fractured leg and then leaves.Vijay remains in his initial position yet analysing something.



**3 Weeks Later…..**

Vijay gets discharged from the hospital but is still required to stay in the recovery zone. There are some chemicals in his brain which exploded and made him even more of a psychopath he already was. He started analysing like crazy. Neither Michael nor Vijay exactly knew where Shekhar was hiding and what his next move was going to be.



He painted his rooms with important clue papers and other mapped out information. He started working more than he used to. Beneath all the papers he got to know about a bank heist which was performed 3 weeks ago but no mainstream media showed that news.Vijay called his DSP asking to know why it was kept such a secret. The DSP said that it was the order from the state government.



The very next day he went to the bank which got robbed and questioned one of the employees there. After some warnings he got to know that it was a Fortuner car which came right inside the lobby shattering the glasses and breaking into the vault as he carried a rifle with him. They say he wore a black mask with red eyes and did not speak much but he stole nearly 5 crores and the assets which were highly confidential and only the state bank had the access to.



After further questioning he took out the info that the vault had the explosives and RDX which were imported from USA and was kept a secret from the world as many countries opposed this trade as this was the most RDX ever sold to the country.The news of the explosives getting stolen would bring heavy backlash to the ruling government of Vedna. The scary part was that nothing was left in the vault, ALL EMPTY.



That day Vijay came home and started thinking of ways to make Shekhar come out of his hole. He thought of cutting one of the most important wires for him. He didn’t have parents so the most important one remained to be Friends.



It was a normal day for Samdhish. He was sitting on the couch of his apartment watching the TV until he heard knocks from the door. He looks through the peak-hole and immediately starts running into his room. The door is shot open with a double barrel shotgun and we see Vijay entering his house limping still with a broken leg. He calls out his name as he goes into his bedroom.

Samdhish was hiding under the table and was trying not to breathe. Vijay saw his shadow and shot at the table. It hit Samdhish on the back and he instantly lost the ability to walk. “Where’s your damn phone?”,Vijay asked him. Samdhish spoke nothing out of fear. ”I asked you a question you asshole”, said Vijay. He then points at a table with his bloody hands. He grabs the phone and throws it on him and asks him to call Shekhar and beg him for help. “If he picks up I won’t kill you, but if he doesn’t…”. He calls him and the phone starts to ring. Shekhar picks up the phone but says nothing for obvious reasons.



 “Shekhar bhai please save me, there is a police officer who entered my house and he wants  to kil…..” -GUNSHOT-.  Vijay shot Samdhish directly on the head. Blood sprinkled out his head like a fountain and a solid head turned like a mashed clay. He grabs the phone and says,”Stop being such a dick and just show up”. The phone declines and Vijay throws the phone on Samdhish’s dead body before leaving.



The DSP shows up at the apartment where he finds Vijay limping with blood on his face. “What happened here sir?”, he asked to which Vijay replied,”Nothing, just killed a fat mosquito”.The DSP showed concern and runs into the room where the blood trail started.”Oh fuck, sir this might create problems”, said the DSP.” It wont, just drag his body to the Kitchen, Light a cigarette in his mouth and loosen the gas cylinder”, said Vijay. “It will look like a cylinder explosion, and yeah just wipe the blood”, he continued with a pause before leaving the apartment.



Vijay started compromising on sleep and started smoking coffee beans rolled in a paper. On being asked by the assistant he said that he thinks Shekhar will plan something in the night which is why he was practicing staying awake. With time, he became more ruthless and stopped thinking twice before killing anyone.Killing started feeling like an art to him and this art was scary.



On the other hand, Michael appeared to be no less. He started being lazier than before and also a bit too depressed.”Any lead on that Bastard?”He asked. “We’re still looking sir, once we find him we know what to do”, said Henry. “No, even if you find him, just keep an eye on him and don’t get smacked on your balls again”, said Michael.



“Master, I believe you’ve been asked to rest more these days”, said Henry. “Not after what that asshole did last time”, Michael continued. “The most I can do is to wait, until that wormhole recovers too”, Michael addresses Vijay. Michael leaves the area and goes into his office. “My master is sick as hell now, even I don’t know what he’ll do next”, said Henry after Michael left.”First time in 45 years, I fear my life from the boy whom I saw grow up”, Henry continued. “It’s not his fault, he was born in the family of blood bastards”, He said before leaving.



Michael sits in his room and looks at Henry whispering something to his fellowmates. “Hey Henry”, Michael called him out. “Yes master”, Henry responded. “What were you whispering about me back there?”Michael pointed out. “Well I’m afraid I did nothing like this master”, Henry justified himself.“Even you started growing poison in your heart against me Henry?”Michael said in a lighter tone.



“Not even in my dreams master”, said Henry. “Do you remember why you refused to get married?” Michael asked. “Because I believed this is my family sir and I shall possess no other”, said Henry. “Do you know what family betrayal feels like?”, said Michael. Henry goes silent. Within a split of a second Micheal grabs a fork and stabs it in Henry’s neck. Blood sprinkles as he crawls to the corner of the room.”Nobody speaks shit about my family”, said Michael. “Absolutely nobody”, he continued.

#                               Part - 2



**3 Months later….**

Many black cars enter the compound where Shekhar used to live. Michael gets out of one of the cars and fires a round of bullets in the air. People come out of their houses to see what the matter was. Michael looked at one window and saw a shadow near there after which he said,”I know you’re here just come out I just wanna talk”. As he was looking at the stairs he actually saw what he hadn’t imagined he’d ever see.



He actually saw Shekhar coming down without any arms with him. Michael felt something after looking at him, like a sudden rush of trauma. The compound residents had come outside and Michael saw the perfect opportunity to unmask Shekhar. He got up on the bonnet and started to speak.



**3 months ago…**

It seemed like Shekhar hadn’t left just after the explosion in the jungle but he had other plans. Michael’s younger brother Harley was over at his friend’s house to complete their final year project. The light had been gone for like an hour now and they had been managing with a candle now.The candle goes off and Harley goes to get the matchbox.They had a translucent  glass door through which one could see outside.



His friend Heer sat in her room but could still see the door in the dark.She was just waiting for Harley to come but she saw something which sent chills across her spine. There were 2 red lit eyes outside the door looking like the devil himself spawned to kill them .The creature knocks calmly until Heer starts to scream like she’d seen a ghost. Harley rushed to her with the matchbox and saw the thing break the glass with his fist and come inside the house.



He ignited the matchstick and threw it at him before running away. The masked guy dodged it and started following them. Heer gets inside the bed with a phone in her hand using which she calls Michael and whispers to him the situation. Michael got tensed but he was in no condition to fight anyone but still he got in the car with his men to get his brother safe.



Harley hid in the closet feeling each step of the invader. He had a dagger with him and he thoroughly scanned every piece of furniture. It was pitch dark inside the house and all that was visible was just his red glowing eyes. He senses something in the closet and even before opening it, he sends the dagger inside the closet to pull out Harvey with it.



He gets him out bleeding and drags him by his leg and takes him somewhere with him. By the time Micheal arrives he’s long gone with just the blood path left behind. Heer was too traumatised to talk and Micheal knew nothing about where his brother was. He had just gotten out of the house when he got a location from an unknown number with no context. He decided to follow it as he had no other option.



The location was a half constructed building which appeared to be tall enough for Micheal to not climb it as he was dealing with several fractures. He got a call from that number and the voice sounded like Harley. “Bhaiya he’s gonna kill me he’s crazy please save me I don’t wanna die please I don't wanna die….” It was Harley crying on the phone. “Heyy, don’t you dare lay your dirty hands on my brother or I’ll snatch your shitty heart out of your chest”, said Micheal as he was devastated upon hearing his brother cry. 



“Try”, said the kidnapper and the voice was never heard before by Micheal and he was confused on why a random guy would kidnap his brother. “Listen whoever you are, just leave my brother alone he has nothing to do with me and my businesses”,said Micheal but the person had nothing in him. He keeps the phone on a table nearby and slowly starts to slice off Harvey’s head.”Nooo AHHHH….”, were the last words which came from the phone and Micheal went crazy after hearing his brother’s screams.



The stairs were broken yet he still asked his men to figure it out on how to get to the top. As they were trying to climb, a heavy thing fell on the ground and it was Harvey’s dead body. Micheal, the one to be feared, breaks down in front of his brother’s body as at that moment he was powerless.But he found a phone in the back-pocket of his jeans and guess what, the cracked phone had a last selfie which was taken by the serial killer with Harvey and the killer was none other than SHEKHAR.



**Present Day….**

Shekhar stood there stunned trying to process what had happened.”Why Harvey huh, could’ve taken me out but why my brother?”, Micheal says in a sad tone. And the mysterious of all, this bastard spoke. I thought you were mute Shekhar, how did you speak? Could you speak from the beginning? Did you lie to all of us present here? What else did you lie about?



His men get out of the car and point their guns at the crowd present near to Shekhar. “Let's play a game. If Shekhar speaks, I take him with me and if he doesn’t I kill him here along with you guys”said Micheal. “I’ll just count from 5""Michael added. “5…..4 ... .3….”, as he counted the men reloading their rifles. The crowd started to shout at Shekhar and asked him to speak up.”2 ... .and 1”, Shekhar tried his best to speak but couldn’t get it out of him.



Micheal smiles and puts Shekhar in the car.”He is the same guy you stood up for after he was released from the jail”, said Micheal before leaving. He takes him to the same building where he found his brother. Shekhar was tied to a chair and was constantly getting hit on the face by Micheal. Micheal was full of agony and was constantly striking Shekhar.

  


He stops and asks him,”You are really good at coming back from the dead aren’t you?”. He gets the same pills he used the very first time to end himself and it was given by the same shopkeeper. “Don’t act so shocked, I myself asked him to give you these pills hoping that they’ll kill you”, Micheal added. “But before killing you I just want to know one thing”, he said. “How did you get the suitcase when you weren't the one who stole it?”. He then realises that Heer describes a man in a black mask with red glowing eyes attacking her brother. He then takes out the mask he’d found after his brother’s death. Now he remembered the bouncers describing a red-eyed guy shooting the employee on the face just to get the suitcase from him.



If Shekhar was the one who killed his brother, he was the one wearing the red-eyed mask and that also means that he was the one who had stolen the suitcase from him that day. As he remembered his personal guard telling that he had thrown Shekhar’s unconscious body into the garbage on the day of the heist. All this means that it was Shekhar himself behind the mask who had been pulling off the stunts with those fleets of cars and bikes. 



He was the one who brutally killed the previous SP as he was the first one to come there. He was the one who had made all the plans and executed them. There was no masked man, it was HIM who had performed it all under an unknown shadow.The day he killed the masked man, from that day on they became the same person. Shekhar remembered the Masked man’s last words which were,”You can’t handle it all, it’ll be easy to spread this into two peopl-”. Exactly, he said about splitting the pressure into two people who were hoisted by only one mind.



That means he needs no mentor, he is his own mentor. Shekhar was just figuring out this puzzle when Micheal took out 6 pills from the box and made Shekhar swallow it. He did after some struggling but showed no movement after doing so. Blood dripped from his nose as he lay unconscious. Micheal felt like he had killed him at last. As he was about to wipe his hand a grenade falls in the room and ..-BOOM-. Shekhar fell from the chair and gained consciousness back. He got up to see many people entering the half constructed building and they looked like police. 



Micheal grabbed his machete and started slicing the police gang. We now see Vijay still smoking a coffee bean cigarette looking at his assistant,”Told ya”. He loads his toys and gets inside the building with a whole army of people. Micheal calls for backup and so they come and absolutely start killing every uniformed being in the building. A whole war had broken out inside a half constructed building. Shekhar thinks of who he really is and starts killing anyone he sees.



He grabs a gun from a dead person with the bullets, loads him up and absolutely starts destroying Micheal’s people. There was a hell lot of bloodbath happening there. Guns firing, grenades exploding, heads being sliced and a hell lot of bodies getting collected. Shekhar had finally discovered who he actually was and actually fought his way through. He eventually comes face to face with Vijay and they both have an intense hand to hand combat. Shekhar makes the first hit on his chest and Vijay retaliates with a kick on his shoulders.



They kept on fighting until Vijay threw Shekhar in the “not-working” elevator. He falls in there and actually gets stuck. He eventually paves his way out from two floors below and what he sees next is shocking. He sees a guy who looks exactly like him and has a dagger in his hands. He ignores it thinking it’s his mind playing games with him again. He spots even more police officers coming into the building with more arms.



Now we see Vijay coming face-to-face with Micheal. That long rivalry is now to be concluded with one’s victory and the other’s defeat.”So long asshole”, said Michael before charging at Vijay.



They start landing punches at each other and make each one count. Vijay gets Micheal in his hands and starts punching him in the face non-stop. He does that until he looks like he’s tired but he isn't and Micheal grabs the fire extinguisher just to hit Vijay with it. He beats Vijay so hard that he falls on the ground. Mickeal strikes again but Vijay holds it and back-strikes Micheal on his eyebrow making him go back. They both run at each other and land another pair of punches. It was like they would eat each other alive. That's when Shekhar spots them and throws a hand-grenade at them making Vijay fall off from the center area of the staircase Whereas Micheal disappeared in the dark.



Shekhar seemed worried, like he had planned something and it wasn’t happening. He goes to the top floor of the building where he can see almost the whole city. He looks at it until he’s called from the back and gets punched on the nose. It was Micheal who started at Shekhar. Shekhar felt powerless and took all those beatings from Micheal. Micheal was not ready to stop. He grabs a knife and cuts off one of Shekhar’s fingers which makes him scream in pain. Micheal tries to make him sit for a while and make him listen to what he was saying.



“Shut up for a moment and just for once in your life just listen to me”, Micheal said frustratedly. “This whole company, this empire, this wealth, this power, this dominance you’re after none of it belongs to me, it was all built by my grand-father”, he continued. “More than 100,000 people are employed in this company and you destroying this company would make them come on the street ”, he said.”You however don’t have a positive image in the society and doing so will make you a villain for the whole country”. “And also, why are you even doing this?”he questioned.”For that damn long dead dog”,he asked. ”Man grow up Shekhar even though I have a dog but I won’t crash the country’s economy and make most of the people on the island unemployed if he dies”he explains.



“No normal person would do that”,he said. He then sits on a chair near to Shekhar’s and calmly says,”Even if I kill you today it’ll be for my brother but man I can even let you go if you promise me that you’ll never ever look at my damn company ever again"", he gives him a last condition. Shekhar looks at Micheal and starts to laugh as he looks at Micheal. Micheal gets confused. 



We now get to know Shekhar’s master plan. He was the one who stole 5 crores from the bank the other day. He bought 8 cars with that money, he packed 40 lakh rupees in each car and sent an anonymous message to many people who were struggling financially. He had also stolen the records of people who were struggling to pay off their loans. He offers them to drive that car to a specific location, park it deep inside and run for your life. And that is because along with money he had planted the RDX in the cars with a time bomb. All the bombs are supposed to explode at 3:55 exactly.



He looks out of the window and sees the explosion happen. The location they got a tip for weren’t some random location…………..but all the secret operating bases of the Bisons group. Micheal gets up and sees what had just happened. One after another, the explosions kept on happening until there were a total of 8 of them done. Just one master plan and the Bisons no longer existed. 8 explosions  destroying all the 8 branches of the Bisons. Micheal was just processing what had happened until Shekhar kicked his head so hard he fell down. 



Now it was Shekhar’s time to shine and he was not gonna miss it. He  ties his hand with a rope and keeps pulling him to his side just to knock him over again. Micheal got weak and bloody from all the beating from Shekhar. He sees a gun in the hands of Micheal but before he could fire it, he gets the rope across his neck and throws him out of the building breaking his neck and eventually killing him.



One big enemy finally died. He pulls over his body towards himself but Micheal is alive and he fires 3 bullets at Shekhar out of which 2 hit him on the shoulder and knock him over. Meanwhile Micheal falls from the top of the building on the ground and now has no chance of surviving as literally just fell from over 20 floors. Hearing the gun shot noise, the police gang decided to come up with all the arms they had as it was the perfect moment for them to catch Shekhar. Vijay was still climbing from the 10th floor but he asked the police to check the top floor. 



All of Micheal's men were killed. But here’s the thing, Shekhar still had some money left on him which is why he planned out for 9 cars and not 8. And the 9th car was parked right in the garage of the half constructed building. They say they have backups for backups and that's what Shekhar did. There was a beach behind the building and so Shekhar went there. He went near the seashores and as he turned back, he heard an explosion and then the whole building collapsed like it was the sky falling.



He looked at the rising sun which rose from the water. He had finally taken his revenge for his dog. But, he didn’t feel the sense of completing something. All he felt was emptiness inside and that is why he now understood that the elders never asked one to go on the path of revenge as it leaves you at a dead-end. “So that’s your victory huh”,came a voice from the back.



It was Vijay, still alive after climbing a collapsing building. He had his “Lucky the gun” with him in his hand. “Whe I got injured, I digged in deeper to know more about you and the more I knew the more I felt like letting you live”, Said Vijay.”I’m pretty sure I’ll adopt a dog after meeting you and I promise to do something for animals i guess”, he continued. But after all, I’m a police officer and I need to follow commands. He pointed his gun at Shekhar.



Shekhar remains still just moving at the end moment when he tried to charge at Vijay but it was too late. The first bullet hit him on the chest and he stopped moving. The second one came on his thigh making him kneel. The third one as he was about to fire, the gun exploded in his hand and the shredded bullet went somewhere near his eyebrows and head. He fell on his back after the last shot as the blood dripped from his forehead. Vijay stood there with his injured hand staring at the rising sun and Shekhar’s dead body. He felt like he achieved something by killing a guy who escaped death so many times but now it was over for him and Vijay  too somewhere in his heart must’ve felt the guilt.



The siren of the ambulance is heard from a distance and he goes to it. Before leaving, he looks at Shekhar one last time to check if he’s gonna get back up again but sadly or not sadly, He instead remains as still as a rock. Vijay goes towards the dead body of Michael which was lying on the ground with blood all over his face and he whispered,”So long Asshole”. Something in him made him look at Shekhar once again and he was still there, DEAD. This convinced him that he is actually gone this time. This ended the long hunt from both the ends and maybe the JUSTICE WAS SERVED.

#          –Extended Storyline– 

 “If Death meant the end of the word,

Then the world would end every second”

  


**45 Days Later…..**

It was a normal evening at Vijay’s house. He was on his bed, beard fully grown and carried an even disturbed look. He was half awake when he got a call from the DSP.”Sir with all due respect may I ask a question”, the voice on the phone said.”Yeah”,said Vijay.”Sir did you actually kill him that day?”, DSP questioned.



“Yes I did”,said Vijay in a gritty tone.”Oh Fuhh..”,said the voice on the phone.”Why? What's the goddamn matter?”Vijay asked.”Sir lets just say, we’ve got a problem and not a small one”. We now get to see what happened just a few days ago in the company ground of the Bison Butchers and Co. 



Many people had gathered there shouting, screaming, cussing and throwing stuff on the speaking stage. People were just getting out of hand and it was getting impossible to handle the crowd. They were the employees who feared losing their jobs due to the attack on the company premises while the company remained silent.



As the crowd was getting worse, 3 fortuners, 2 Scorpios and 1 Land rover in the middle entered the premises and suddenly the crowd went numb. The silence became evident as the car doors opened and a person wearing a white kurta and jeans got out. He had a cigarette in his mouth with Ray-Ban shades in his eyes.



He went to the stage and sat down with other members who followed him. The crowd just stared at him with no words to say. One of the guys in the crowd got pissed at the cowardness of the crowd and asked them to throw stones at the person seated. Nobody listened to him which is why he himself got on the stage which was a big big mistake.



He had a large stone in his hand with which he was about to crush his head but the man grabs his own stone, inserts it in his mouth destroying his jaws and grabs a gun from the security. He uses the back of the gun to hit the rock so that his mouth and head would explode. He kept hitting him until his head was not absolutely crushed.



He gets back from his body and moves towards the crowd. His white attire had turned red and his face looked even more terrifying with the blood on it. He directly looked towards the crowd and that look explained why everyone was so terrified of him. It was none other than Jason who had come back to **rule.**



“Why do you remain scared? You are the reason this company lasted 98 years”,Jason spoke up. “You are my family, and no family member is thrown out of the house when things turn ugly ”, he continued.”I am the head of this family and I ensure you that nobody will lose their job, every family gets a food on their table and the Bisons still stand tall”,He motivated the crowd. The crowd burst into applause and cheerings.”This is not the first time somebody tried attacking us. Many peoples, rebelions, politicians, government and even a whole damn country wanted to erase our existence yet we stand tall”, Jason kept speaking.



“If blowing firecrackers in our factories meant the end, then we are endless”,He continued speaking. “But that doesn’t mean that we’ll forget what was done to us”, He spoke after a pause.”Whoever or whatever it was, I promise to catch him ALIVE”. “Even if he’s dead, I’ll drag him from hell to our world and make each part of his flesh feel the pain you’re feeling right now”,He said. The crowd starts cheering like they were in a stadium.



Jason gets down and sits in his car. As they were driving, Jason saw someone backstage with a long beard. He himself had a long beard but that person seemed a little different. He was in his uniform and had worn a cap with a cigarette in his mouth. Jason stares at him for a long time until their vehicle leaves.



As the cars leave, we focus on the bearded guy who was actually Shekhar. He had a cigarette in his mouth and glanced a look at Jason’s car. He was observing every move and was sure that what he was unto just because of his dead dog wasn’t going to end easily and that's  because this dog fight just experienced the entry of a

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1ps4fu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ps4fu8/beware_of_the_crawling_children/,Beware of The Crawling Children,"The first time I saw one, it was wearing my neighbor’s face like a loose hood.

I didn’t realize that’s what it was at first. I only knew I’d woken to a sound that didn’t belong in any sane house at 3:17 a.m.—a soft, wet *scratch-scratch*, like fingernails worrying a scab. The noise came from inside the walls, it was between the plaster and the studs, in the thin, dead space where mice turn to husks and old pipes sweat in the dark.

My bedroom smelled faintly of pennies and damp leaves. I remember that because I sat up and breathed it in, thinking I’d left a window open. My tongue tasted metallic, like I’d bitten it in my sleep.

The scratching stopped.

A beat later, something *moved* inside the wall beside my bed. Not a shuffle—an intentional, careful slide, like a body turning sideways to squeeze through a narrow place.

Then came the whisper. Not words, but a breath, drawn in too close to hear as air. The sort of sound you get when someone leans toward your ear in the dark to tell you a secret.

I should’ve gotten up. I should’ve turned on every light in the house and laughed at myself in the kitchen with a mug of tea. But I was still new to the rental, still trying to convince myself I’d made the right choice leaving the city and my sister’s couch behind. I was clinging to the lie that the woods around Greymire were “peaceful,” and not “hungry.”

So I lay there, stiff as a board, staring at the shadow the dresser made on the floor.

And then I heard it again—*scratch-scratch*—but this time it was in the hallway, outside my door.

I held my breath until it hurt.

The sound slid closer, stopping right on the other side of the thin wood. A slight pause, like whatever it was, had to remember how doors worked.

A child’s giggle puffed through the crack beneath the door.

It wasn’t a usual giggle. It had a wet hitch to it, a tiny cough inside the laugh, the way kids sound when they’ve been playing too long in cold air. The giggle ended in a sigh, and the sigh ended in a *tap*—something light bumping the door like a knuckle, or a tooth.

“Mr. Calder,” a voice whispered, using my name like it had been practicing it. “Are you awake?”

My skin went cold in a wave from my scalp to my toes. The voice was very young, but it was wrong in the way it chose its sounds. It rounded vowels too carefully. It pressed consonants as if they were buttons.

I didn’t answer.

Another giggle followed by a scrape.

Then the doorknob *turned*.

It rattled once, twice, then stopped. Thankfully, I remembered to lock the door. I’d been meticulous about that, a habit formed from too many years sharing walls with strangers. The sound that followed was… thoughtful—a faint, slow breathing.

Then, a soft thump, as if something had lain down on the hallway floor, right against my door.

And then the scratching began again—nails on wood—moving downward, down the face of my door, down to the gap, as if little fingers were feeling for purchase.

I stared at that gap like a man watching a drain he’s sure will swallow him.

Two pale fingertips appeared under the door, slick and flexing. They were too long for a child’s hand, the nails blackened like burned match heads. The fingers curled and hooked, pulling.

The gap widened just enough for me to see an eye.

Not a child’s eye.

It was gray, filmed over, and it rolled in its socket without blinking, searching the room. The lid was too thin, as if the skin had been stretched to cover an orb that didn’t belong there. A faint, sweet rot seeped beneath the door—spoiled apples and damp soil.

The eye found me, and it just stared.

My body refused to move, and my throat refused to sound. The part of my brain that should’ve screamed *RUN* just repeated one flat thought over and over: **That is not a child.**

The eye blinked once, slowly, and the fingers withdrew.

A moment later, the hallway went quiet.

Not quiet like safety—quiet like a held breath waiting to strike.

I stayed frozen until dawn. When sunlight finally seeped through the blinds, I slipped out of bed and flung my door open.

The hallway was empty.

But the carpet in front of my room was damp, crushed flat in the shape of something that had lain there for a long time. Little streaks of black—like soot or ground-up nail—dragged away toward the living room.

I followed them.

I regret that more than anything.

The streaks led past the bathroom, past the spare room I’d been meaning to turn into an office, and ended at the front door. The deadbolt was still thrown. The chain still looped. There was no sign anyone had entered or left.

But on the inside of the door, low near the bottom, where a toddler might press their palm, were smear marks—muddy crescents and faint, oily handprints. Something had been touching my house, as if testing its skin.

I called my sister, Jules, because that’s what you do when you’re trying not to sound crazy. Jules answered on the third ring, groggy and annoyed.

“Eli, it’s—” she started.

“I heard a kid in the house,” I said. My voice sounded too steady. “Like… a kid. But not. There were fingers under the door.”

There was a pause on the line.

“Did you hear singing?” Jules asked quietly.

My stomach dropped. “What?”

Jules exhaled through her nose. I could picture her sitting up in bed, pulling her hair out of her face. “Mom used to talk about it,” she said. “When we were little. She said there were… things in Greymire. ‘Crawling children.’ She said if you hear them, you don’t answer. You don’t look. You don’t open anything.”

“Why didn’t you tell me this before I moved here?” I snapped, a sharpness fueled by fear.

“I thought it was just one of her stories,” Jules said, but her voice had gone thin. “Eli, listen. Don’t go outside after dark. And if you see them—if you see *kids* where there shouldn’t be kids—don’t help. Don’t—”

A sound came through my phone speaker, faint but unmistakable: a giggle.

It wasn’t Jules.

It was distant, like it had come from the other end of my living room.

I dropped the phone.

The giggle didn’t stop. It slid along the walls. It circled the room like a moth around a lamp. My heart hammered so hard my ribs hurt.

“Eli?” Jules shouted through the phone, tinny from the floor. “Eli, what is that?”

I backed away until my shoulders hit the kitchen counter. My eyes tracked the doorway to the hall, the dark mouth of it, as if expecting something to peek out.

The giggle stopped.

A child’s voice—sweet, careful—floated from the hall. “Mr. Calder. You dropped it.”

Something skittered across the floor into the kitchen.

My phone, pushed by unseen fingers, slid to a stop near my feet. A smear of dampness streaked behind it.

I didn’t pick it up.

I couldn’t.

Because the smear wasn’t just water.

It was dark and viscous, with a faint copper sheen that caught the morning light.

Blood, thin as spit.

I fled. I didn’t grab a coat, didn’t grab my wallet—just my keys. I drove into town on shaking hands, parked in front of the diner, and sat in the car with the windows up, watching families go in and out like the world made sense.

After a while, I forced myself inside. Greymire’s diner had the kind of fluorescent lights that make everyone look ill. I ordered coffee, but I didn’t taste it. The waitress, a woman with a tired face and forearms corded with muscle, kept glancing at me like she could smell my panic.

“New out on Alder Road,” she said finally, sliding a mug toward me. It wasn’t a question.

I stared at the coffee’s black surface, at my own distorted face. “Yeah.”

Her eyes flicked to my hands. “You got scratches.”

I looked down. Three thin lines ran along my knuckles, as if I’d brushed against rough wood. There was dried black grit in them, like soot.

“I didn’t—” I began.

The waitress leaned in, voice low. “Don’t go digging,” she said. “You hear children at night, you keep your mouth shut. You don’t let them know you’re *home*.”

My mouth went dry. “You know about them?”

She didn’t answer directly. Her gaze darted to the window, to the woods line beyond the road, as if it was listening. “Kids go missing here,” she said. “Not often. Not enough for the state to care. But enough for us. Enough that we lock the doors and don’t play hero.”

“I didn’t answer,” I said. “I didn’t open the door.”

She nodded, like that mattered, like it bought me something. “Did you look?”

I hesitated.

Her expression tightened. “You did.”

I swallowed. “Just… an eye.”

The waitress’s jaw flexed. “They like that,” she murmured. “They like it when you *recognize* them. Gives them shape.”

“What do they want?” I asked. My voice cracked on the last word.

She straightened. “To be let in,” she said, and walked away before I could ask more.

I should’ve stayed in town. I should’ve called a motel, called my sister, called anyone. But pride is a stupid, sharp thing, and I’d spent my whole adult life sharpening mine to survive. I told myself I’d imagined it. I told myself there was some rational explanation—an animal, a prank, stress.

By dusk, I was back on Alder Road, my headlights slicing through a tunnel of trees. The woods leaned close, branches knitted overhead like ribs. The air outside was damp and heavy, carrying the smell of moss and something faintly sweet, like overripe fruit.

My house waited in a small clearing, its porch light buzzing. The windows looked dark, like eyes closed against a bad dream.

I stepped onto the porch.

The wood under my boot gave a soft, wet creak.

I froze, looking down.

A smear of black grime streaked across the planks. Little prints—handprints, finger marks—overlapped each other, leading in slow circles. Whoever had been there hadn’t walked. They’d dragged themselves, palms and nails and knees, tracing the porch like it was a ritual circle.

My stomach turned.

I unlocked the door as quickly as I could, not wanting to stand outside where the trees could watch. The deadbolt clicked. The door swung inward with a sigh.

The house smelled different.

Not stale, not dusty.

It smelled like damp earth turned up with a shovel.

And beneath that, the copper tang of fresh blood.

I flicked on the light. The entryway was empty. The living room beyond it was empty.

Then I saw the wall beside the coat rack.

There were dozens of scratch marks in it, etched into the paint. Some were shallow, like testing. Some were deep enough to expose plaster, and in those grooves was black grime, packed tight. The marks formed a crude shape—like a child’s drawing of a person.

But the proportions were wrong.

Too long in the arms. Too many bends in the legs.

And in the center, where the chest would be, someone had scratched a word.

**OPEN.**

My throat constricted.

Behind me, the door swung shut.

Not slammed—closed gently, with a soft *click* of the latch, as if polite hands had closed it.

The porch light went out, and the house fell into a dimness that felt thicker than darkness should, as if the air itself had congealed.

From the hallway, the scratching began.

*Scratch-scratch.*

Closer than before. Not in the walls this time—on the floorboards.

The sound moved like a centipede, a hundred tiny points of contact.

I backed toward the living room, my hand groping for something—anything—a lamp, a poker, a weapon.

The scratching stopped at the mouth of the hall, and a small shape eased into view.

A child, at first glance. Bare feet. A too-big T-shirt hanging off narrow shoulders and pale limbs.

But it didn’t stand.

It *crawled*, belly low, elbows and knees bending the wrong way. Its joints moved like they were made of wet rope. The skin on its hands was abraded raw, and its nails were thick and black, worn down to stubs.

It lifted its head.

The face made my stomach lurch.

It was Mrs. Dalloway from two houses down—her kind smile, her soft cheeks, her silver hair. But the skin hung strangely loose, like it was draped over a skull that didn’t match. Her mouth was too broad, pulled into a grin that exposed gums and teeth filed unevenly, as if something had tried to *make* a smile.

And the eyes… Those weren’t Mrs. Dalloway’s eyes.

They were gray and filmed, like pearls in muddy water.

“Mr. Calder,” it whispered, voice bubbling with childish excitement. “You came back.”

My vision narrowed. My heart thudded loud enough to drown out my thoughts.

Behind it, more movement in the hallway—shadows shifting, small bodies piling into the darkness like kittens in a box.

Little hands slapped the floor. Nails scratched. Soft giggles stitched together, a tapestry of wrongness.

“Don’t,” I managed, though I didn’t know what I was begging for. “Please. Don’t.”

The thing in Mrs. Dalloway’s face tilted its head. The skin on its cheek creased oddly, like fabric.

“Why?” it asked, as if genuinely curious. “We’re cold.”

Another voice chimed in from the hall, higher, breathier. “We’re hungry.”

A third voice, too close to the floor. “We’re *stuck*.”

The crawling thing in front of me inched forward, hands splaying wide. Its fingers were too long, the knuckles too prominent, as if there were extra bones inside. As it moved, its stomach dragged across the floor, leaving a wet smear.

I saw then that its shirt was soaked at the belly, dark with something that glistened.

It smelled stronger now—the sweet rot, the turned earth like a grave opened too soon.

“Open,” it whispered again, softer, coaxing. “Open for us.”

I shook my head frantically. I backed up until my calves hit the coffee table. My hand found the lamp and yanked it up like a club.

The crawling thing’s grin widened. Its jaw stretched with a faint crackle, as if the hinges were being forced. A thin line of black fluid seeped from the corner of its mouth.

From the hallway, a chorus of giggles rose. The sound was like flies.

“Open,” they chanted, voices layered, sweet and wet. “Open. Open. Open.”

My mind flashed to the scratch marks on the wall. To the finger under my door. To the eye that had found me.

Recognition gives them shape.

I squeezed my eyes shut.

In the darkness behind my lids, something moved anyway—little forms skittering across the back of my thoughts. Tiny hands searching for cracks.

A wet pressure brushed my ankle.

I screamed and swung the lamp down.

It connected with something soft. There was a sickening squelch, a crunch like breaking fruit. Warm fluid splattered my bare feet.

A child’s shriek tore through the room, too high to be human. The sound scraped my nerves raw.

I opened my eyes.

The crawling thing had latched onto my leg.

Not with hands—with its *mouth*. Its jaw unhinged wider than any person’s could, and its teeth were sunk into my calf. The skin around the bite puckered, as if being sucked inward. A pain like fire shot up my leg.

I kicked, but it clung, nails digging into my shin, leaving lines of heat. It didn’t bite like an animal. It felt like something trying to pull more than flesh—like it was drinking the *idea* of me through my skin.

In the hallway, the other shadows surged.

Small bodies poured into the living room, crawling fast, too fast, their limbs bending wrong, their faces not quite faces—some wearing familiar features like masks, some smooth and stretched as drumskin with only holes where eyes should be.

They made the room feel smaller, the air thicker. Their giggles became sobs, then laughter again, cycling like a stuck record.

“Stay,” they whispered. “Stay with us. Stay down here.”

I flailed, swinging the lamp wildly. It struck something, and there was a crack, a wet snap. A hand skittered across the floor on its own, fingers still flexing like spiders.

The bite on my calf numbed, then tingled. The tingling spread, creeping up my leg like ants under the skin. My knee buckled, not from pain, but from a sudden uncertainty about how it should bend. My ankle rolled in a way it wasn’t meant to. My bones felt… negotiable.

The crawling thing looked up at me, eyes shining with delight. “We’re making room,” it crooned.

A hand—small, cold, with black nails—pressed against my other calf. Another against my wrist. Another against my throat, just resting there, exploratory, like fingers testing fruit for ripeness.

I understood then what they did.

They didn’t just kill you.

They *rearranged* you. They unmade the human rules inside you until you could fit where they lived—beneath floors, inside walls, in the tight, wet dark.

I lunged backward, slamming myself against the wall, crushing one of them between my spine and plaster. It burst like a bag of rotten fruit, spraying black fluid and pinkish slurry. The smell made me gag.

The hand at my throat tightened, not choking—pulling my skin downward, as if trying to drag my face off my skull.

I grabbed it, nails slicing my palm. The hand felt boneless, too flexible.

I shoved my fingers into its wrist and felt something give, like wet clay.

It squealed.

The pressure eased for a second, and in that second, I did the only thing I could think of: I ran for the front door.

My leg screamed. My joints felt unreliable. My calf burned where the bite had been, though the skin there now looked… puckered, as if the flesh had been kneaded.

The door was only a few steps away, but the room was full of crawling bodies. Hands grabbed my ankles, my jeans, my shirt. Nails hooked into fabric and skin. Their giggles turned into a chant again, breathy and eager.

“Open,” they whispered in my ears. “Open. Open.”

I reached the door and fumbled at the lock.

A small weight slammed into my back, pinning me. Something cold pressed to the side of my face. A cheek. A child’s cheek, damp and too smooth.

“I can help,” a voice murmured right into my ear.

It sounded like my sister.

My heart fractured.

I turned my head without meaning to, searching, and for a split second I saw Jules’s face—her eyes, her mouth, her little freckle near her lip.

But the skin was wrong. The smile was too broad. The eyes had that gray film.

Recognition.

It *shivered* with pleasure at my attention.

“Jules?” I choked.

The thing’s grin stretched. “Yes,” it whispered. “Yes. That’s me.”

Something inside my chest crumpled. Grief surged hot and dizzying, and the hands on me tightened, as if they could taste it.

“Open,” it said gently. “Let us out. Let us in.”

My fingers closed around the deadbolt again. I felt the old habit, the muscle memory of unlocking, of letting someone I loved through a door.

And then, somewhere deep under the panic, another memory sparked—Jules asking me on the phone if I’d heard *singing*. Mom’s stories, the ones I’d rolled my eyes at as a kid.

Don’t answer. Don’t look. Don’t open.

The thing in Jules’s face hummed a note, low and sweet—a lullaby cadence. The sound vibrated through my bones like a tuning fork.

My hand twitched toward the lock.

I couldn’t trust my body. They were already rewriting it.

So I used something I still trusted: my teeth.

I bit down on my own tongue.

Pain exploded bright and clean. Hot blood flooded my mouth, sharp and real. The shock snapped something loose inside my brain, as a chain yanked hard.

I screamed—not words, just raw sound—and threw my weight forward.

The deadbolt clicked.

The door jerked open.

Cold night air slapped my face, smelling of pine and mud and freedom. I stumbled onto the porch, half-falling, dragging my leg, gagging on blood.

Behind me, the house erupted in movement. The crawling children surged toward the open doorway like water finding a crack.

For one impossible second, I thought I’d doomed the whole town.

Then the porch light flickered back on.

Its buzzing hum filled the air like a spell.

The crawling bodies hit the threshold and stopped as if they’d smashed into invisible glass. They piled against each other, limbs writhing, faces pressed into shoulders and backs. Their nails scraped frantically at the doorframe. Their giggles turned into angry, hungry hisses.

The thing wearing Jules’s face reached out, fingers trembling at the edge of the light.

It leaned forward, and the skin on its face began to… blister. The features sagged, melting like wax. A smell of burned hair and sweet rot filled the air.

It recoiled, shrieking.

The porch light held.

I didn’t wait to understand why. I ran.

I ran into the yard, into the gravel, into the night, limping and bleeding, my joints still buzzing with wrongness. The woods pressed close, whispering with leaves.

Behind me, the house rang with a chorus of furious little voices.

“Mr. Calder,” they called, sweet again, coaxing, as if anger was just another mask. “Mr. Calder. Come back. We’re cold.”

I didn’t look back.

I didn’t answer.

I made it to my car on sheer terror and adrenaline. I slammed the door, locked it, and drove with my headlights cutting through the trees like blades.

Only once I hit the main road did I glance down at my leg.

The bite mark was gone.

In its place, just above my ankle, were three blackened crescents—like tiny fingerprints—embedded beneath my skin, as if something had pressed in and left its shape inside me.

And when I flexed my foot, my ankle bent a little too far.

You might read this and think, ""Then don’t go to Greymire.” **Don’t rent the little house on Alder Road.**

That’s not enough.

Because the crawling children don’t belong to one town. They belong to any place with rot beneath the paint, any place with thin walls and older stories. They don’t need a front door if they can find a crack in your attention.

If you hear scratching inside your walls at night, don’t knock back.

If a child’s voice says your name through a door, don’t answer.

And if you ever, ever see an eye watching you from the dark gap beneath the wood—

don’t let it know you’ve recognized it.

Because once you give them shape, they start making room.

And they are *so* patient.

They are crawling toward you right now, taking their time, smiling with borrowed faces, waiting for the moment you decide to be kind.

So please Beware of The Crawling Children.",1,1766316479.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

The niche world is fun to explore when you are like myself very picky. You know, when you’re not trying to be a contrarian by hating on mainstream content, nor trying to be hip or to sound cool or “different.” You’re just trying to find what you enjoy. I hate the elitist attitude of individuals who actually know what they’re saying, but think their taste is better than the majority of people because they’re very well accustomed to high quality art. Shallow and immature. Or the pretentious ones who wanna sound sophisticated. Or the ones who pass on genuine gems just because these gems are mainstream. I don’t particularity hate the later type, mind you, but man aren’t they missing a lot?! I’ve got a friend who buys niche and niche only. He’s a perfume collector who is not very familiar with Hermes’ Jardin line. I brought him **Un Jardin Sur Le Nil** the other day to try. He took a sniff and immediately said: “Meh. It’s a designer.” I chuckled. 

Part 1 is here if you’re interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/s/JCKmtO7ILL

I have made a habit now of wearing soft not very expensive perfumes in the days I decide I wanna visit the shop so that I don’t feel guilty or overwhelmed when deciding on what to wear there. Daniela Andrier’s **Luna Rossa Sport** has been my pick mostly. I wish she would collaborate with Amouage one day. I love her work and the Omani house.

Today’s find is very Amouage reminiscent. **Indigo Extrait de Parfum by Baruti**. Rose, mastic/lentisque, and olibanum. This is what I get the most. It’s very Middle Eastern. Very familiar as well, but unlike the majority of scents that fall into this category, this one is actually not very sweet, nor loud or intense. It’s a bit soft and quite shy in projection. The rose is jammy. It reminds me of the rose in **Guidance 46**. The mastic and olibanum smell natural. Very well blended scent. **Chai** seems to be their most popular scent. Sad though the tester was empty. I also really wanted to sample **Hot Cotton** which their website describes as a “realistic scent of your laundry just when you start to iron” with a hot iron accord and musk as the only notes listed, but the store didn’t have it. I’ll stick to **Cargo de Nuit** for this particular vibe. Also Daniela Andrier’s. 

Part 3 will feature a spicy fig scent. Yup, you read that right. a VERY SPICY FIG scent!

Then I had a lady come through wanting two $1000+ money orders, and the machine decided it was going to jam, meaning my manager had to come in.  She was not at all mad at me because she had to be the one who fixed the machine and put paper in. She is the only one with the key. 

Then, I had an asshat claiming to be the nephew of the owner. He felt the need to tell me this when I asked to see his name and driver's license number. I am in Texas, and recently we started selling THC.  The prompt shows their name and driver's license number. This goes for cigarettes and beer as well. He did briefly throw the ID at me which I was able to get the information. However, he asked for my name and told me that his uncle was going to hear about it... Good because his uncle should know the fucking policy. I was extra cold when I told him to have a nice day.

1ps42cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorspotlight/comments/1ps42cr/a_sad_tale/,A sad tale,"I've always wanted to know something about my own voice given how I love watching and reading scary lore and horror stuff  that takes my interests. The first time I had this thought I was younger, and would help my older brother with music.

Years passed before I had the same thought pass through my mind. Staring at a window pondering why can't I just hear my official voice. Every recording I had with my voice over. I've always felt it's off no matter the devices used. 

Anyone I asked this question about I just felt like they truly didn't understand what I meant when I asked about this topic. It got me thinking about what really goes on with voice recordings given we aren't the creators of the device's iPhone, Android, even video cameras and voice recorders themselves had me feeling like even expensive equipment used for actors wouldn't give the full extent of anyone's vocals on rec.

I've heard myself in a dream talking once and when I awoke I really understood that even hearing my voice when I speak out loud it's different then another person hearing me speaking, really if I could actually get a voice actor to do an impression of my voice then truly I'd know how I sound to people.

With that I searched for about a year finally having found a person that looked at my thread on an online post asking about voice impersonators and that I would pay generously if they could actually be able to get it perfectly.

Doug was this dude's name he sent the voice message to me via email. I made a specific request for how everything would be done. When he sent it and I heard it for the first time my body quivered at the mere thoughts and reality of it actually being what I wanted and well would also pay forward to be honest even if this guy wasn't a professional I was kinda surprised and almost felt like I was a scientist testing his theorem. 

Doug was living in another state and even though I even said I'd pay for his flight over to meet and talk he declined my offers and just said that he would be able to meet in about a few months for a ""job interview he had around where I lived"" I didn't really care about it and was a little bit overwhelmed ""does he really sound like me"" I thought..

When January came I had a message on my phone saying ""yo it's Doug heading to the airport I'll be in LA tomorrow morning"". It was late at night when I received the message from Doug. And figured out what time he would arrive at the airport.

When my phone alarm went off at 5:Am 
I awoke too hearing soft tapping on my window. I guess part of me imagined it until I looked over at the window blinds and swaying curtains from the morning breeze lift upward showing a face like figure with what looked like a pair of dark blue eyes staring directly at my eyes. I jumped letting out a small ""oh shit!"" As my eyes drifted towards the top of the curtains for a split second as I flinched. Now staring back at the window where I was first looking at. Cold and angrily annoyed at the feelings of uncertainty I yelped as my pet dog 'zilver ' jumped on my bed greeting me with his morning wants..which was to take his early poop.

Afternoon came around when Doug called my cellphone asking to meet up around a coffee shop as it was closer towards his interview. My first thoughts when I got into my car driving over to the coffee shop was how I was going to feel when I hear my own voice 
Being spoken towards me as well if I should research more upon why electronic equipment for vocals give an off putting effect and the reasoning for this.

Doug used his real voice when we met up as well showed me some of his impressions of old cartoon characters we both watched when in our younger days. ""You're really ready for this man"" he asked siping his coffee in a cool manner as if to say how much time he put in perfecting this for me was maybe more than I could handle or bear.

As I lifted my phone to record the conversation his exact words shot out as if he not only read my mind but almost hurt my own voice as if hearing someone use my voice affected my body's health.
I froze hearing this.. ""you alright bro?"" Doug asked me in his own voice. ""Yeah"" I said back with a raspy spoken tone.. ""my dad was a master at doing what he loved"" Doug said holding his cup like a child at a Christmas or cold day family event. ""He said some things to me about this type of work the reason I asked if you were ready for this"". I looked back from a sip of my coffee as he spoke talking about when he was younger watching his father do his work for the circus and how one day when performing in front of a crowd a man in a dirt color jacket called him a"" fake"". My dad being prideful at his talents asked what the man meant. Doug made a look down before asking me why I wanted this from him.
I told him my plan and when I looked at his face his eyes widened as if I said something worth the amount of a taboo "" I must apologize he said quickly I don't wanna be late to my interview sorry but if you have time I might be around here again later today"".
I wanted to know what he saw his father do that day when the man called him a 'fake' but I was taking a lot of his time and didn't want to drive the one person that can mimic my voice away. So I kindly agreed to come back to the coffee shop around the time he said his interview would be over.

I lied to his face I thought as he walked away I was just going to sit there till he had more time to chat I didn't mind the wait as well with my computer in my car  did some research while waiting.

He never got back to the shop. ""figures"" I said under my breath as I lopped outside carrying my stuff in hand. ""Yo!"" I heard Doug as he ran towards me. ""Sorry man didn't think I'd be that long but glad I caught you"" catching his breath..""was thinking about what you said earlier about your research and I just gotta warn you about this.""

""About what?"" I asked almost annoyed at the thought of ending my own reason behind what I was doing. "" That came off wrong I.. learned a lot from my father's death.
And when I found out about your post years had passed so I didn't think much about it""..""dude!.. Please about what! I've sat here for like at least 3 hours and I don't want to sound judgemental 
But if you don't wanna help me it's fine you got the cash I offered for this meetup I got to hear what I actually sound like I'm impressed but please don't make me feel like I shouldn't have met you I also had to get a dog sitter."" As I went to put my thing's in the trunk Doug looked at me then the ground"" 'the day he died"" Doug said "" that weird jacket man asked my father to provide proof that he wasn't just paying people who were able to speak like a ventriloquist.. that man cursed my dad and said that ""if he couldn't mimic his bosses voice he'd die for being just what he was a fake."" My dad said ""he'd do them one better"" in the voice of the man that wore the dirt colored jacket. And prove his talents were genuine. As he looked at the guy's boss who I saw walking towards my father the boss guy spoke with a raspy voice one would call harsh to the tongue."" 

""So what happened"".. I asked as I felt my own face go pale thinking about what really went down in my own imagination. ""My dad was shot when he used the man's boss's voice and as I lost my father the same man that shot him looked at me and spoke calmly. "" He's not real, kid we found your dad dead half placed into a pond over yonder. Man's chest and heart was ripped apart with a bite close to them near wolves."" As Doug said those words my own thoughts were ""dude's gotta be one"" but he continued ""said that he was using me for bait and the circus as a way to eat others. ""So a skin walker"" I asked ""no something worse"". He replied using the voice I had. As he walked closer poking his now long sharp thin nails into my body's chest as I looked down at the sight of this happening, my vision blurred and my last memory and final thoughts falling backwards before leaving this world was this man Doug's face slowly began morphing to look like me,and hearing that lasting sound of skin and bone crunching and that voice....I feel like I remember that voice as my own.

1ps41e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodContent/comments/1ps41e9/researching_used_cars_in_san_diego_online_the/,Researching Used Cars in San Diego Online: The Modern Buyer's Checklist,"The thought of shopping for a [used cars in San Diego](https://www.miramarcarcenter.com/) can feel like a marathon before you even start. The sun’s out, but your motivation might be hiding. These days, the real work doesn’t begin on a car lot. It starts right at your kitchen table, with a laptop and a cold drink. Smart buyers know that a little digital legwork is the ultimate secret to a stress-free purchase. For folks in San Diego, Miramar Car Center gets that. They’ve built their entire online experience around making this first, crucial phase not just easy, but actually empowering.

Think of online research as your reconnaissance mission. You’re gathering intel, getting the lay of the land, all without any pressure. A good first step? Just browse. Get a feel for what’s out there. Websites with clear, extensive inventories, like Miramar Car Center’s, are a gift. You can filter by what matters to you, be it mileage, model year, or that must have sunroof for coastal drives. This isn’t just window shopping. It’s about building a realistic picture of your options and your budget. You start to see which models are plentiful and which are rare finds. That knowledge is pure gold.

Now, let’s talk about trust. Anyone can post shiny pictures online. The real question is, what’s the story behind the shine? This is where your checklist gets serious. A reputable dealer won’t make you dig for the facts. They’ll put them right upfront. Look for that free CarFax report button. Click it. A vehicle’s history is its biography, and you need to read it. Was it a local car? How many owners did it have? A clean history report is the foundation of peace of mind. It’s not just a document. It’s a promise that what you see is what you get.

Next up, market value. This is where a lot of the old school anxiety used to come in, right? The fear of overpaying. Here’s a little insider tip: dealers who spend time researching fair pricing are actually doing you a huge favor. They’re taking the awkward haggle out of the equation before you even walk in. When you’re looking at a listing, cross reference the asking price with other similar used cars in San Diego. If it’s in the ballpark and includes a solid history report, you’re likely looking at a straight shooter. Miramar Car Center, for instance, emphasizes that they do this homework so you don’t have to. That’s a sign they value your time as much as your business.

Finally, don’t overlook the human element, even online. Can you get your financing questions answered? Is there a clear path to a simple pre approval? That’s part of research, too. Locking in a budget range from the comfort of your couch changes everything. It turns a dream into a plan. Suddenly, that car you’ve been eyeing isn’t just a maybe. It’s a tangible possibility.

So take a deep breath. Pour another cup of coffee. Doing your homework online isn’t a chore. It’s the smartest move you can make. It turns you from a passive browser into an informed buyer, ready to find a quality vehicle that fits your life. And when you’re researching used cars in San Diego, that confidence is the best feature you can have.",1,1766314909.0,GoodContent,1,1.0,False

1ps40vt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ps40vt,Request: New rented property,"Hi folks,

I am soon moving into this property above, I am by myself and don't need a massive amount of space, but I am aware that this is going to be quite tight. This is my first time renting solo after a breakup, and I would like any advice that people could provide please?

  
Quick details:  
  
\- Based in the UK, renting the property  
  
\- I WFH two days a week, but I need a dedicated computer space with at least 2 monitors to do my job effectively (Laptop + Monitor usually). My current computer desk is 112cm x 60cm. I could downsize my desk reasonably, but this takes time and money that I don't honestly have at the moment.

\- The bed has no storage options underneath, and the house doesn't have any shelving apart from what is visible.

\- I am not fussy at all with what this will end up looking like in the long run. This isn't my forever home and I know it, and I will be decorating the walls with shelving & pictures to help with the general look.

I am aware it is a very small place, but I want to try and be as smart as I can about using the space available to me in good ways so I'm not tripping over myself. I don't tend to have people over a lot, and I don't have kids or pets to worry about. }  
  
This is less of a request for decoration, and more of a cry for help from those who are a heck of a lot better than I am with this. I will take any advice I can get from this community, or recommendations on different communities to post this.

Think would be great to be found by my wife after she been out shopping for the day thought coffee table would be a great place to be tied and discovered. Table has ring points around it.

All set snapped shut the carabena locks ones I cannot reach myself. Panic and pleasure rushed through my body. 

Not long afterwards heard the squeak on windows, dam window cleaners day had my collar chain tight making me only look down, trying to work out could I be seen all in black latex might hide my location. Seemed to take ages hearing the ladders move around the house as they moved around then ring and knock on the door guess he wanted paying too. My car was in the driveway way, the letter box clattered guess bill was dropped off but gave me a shock. 

I relaxed for few hours then heard front door bell ring again, conversation sounded like the cleaning lady talking and then key in the door opening. Her wages were on the hall way table, had suspicions  she sent me tied up before never saying anything.

Hear foot steps then sound of the door opening slightly then closing tight. Then sounds of front door closing Guessing I been seen again. 

Not sure what time it was now hoping wife would return to find me. Heard the answer phone click on my wife saying she told cleaner to collect her wages as you must have gone out,said she bumped in to some old friends going to a spa for rest of the day and meal so don’t wait up be a late one.

1ps3z3w,https://i.redd.it/kuzkp6h6gj8g1.png,The Secret Role of Micronutrients in Energy and Focus,"Most people think energy and focus come from coffee, sleep, or sheer willpower. The truth is far simpler and far more overlooked: micronutrients. Vitamins and minerals—the tiny components of your diet—are the unsung heroes behind every signal your brain sends and every ounce of energy your body produces. Without them, no amount of caffeine or motivation can make up for the deficit.

Micronutrients act as catalysts for the chemical reactions that produce energy in your cells. B vitamins, magnesium, and iron, for example, are essential for converting food into ATP, the energy currency your body runs on. Deficiencies aren’t just subtle—they manifest as fatigue, brain fog, poor concentration, and even mood swings. You may be eating enough calories, but without micronutrients, your body’s engine is running on empty.

Focus, too, relies on these small but mighty nutrients. Omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and vitamin D play direct roles in neurotransmitter production, supporting dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine pathways that govern attention, memory, and motivation. When levels are low, the brain struggles to function efficiently, and productivity suffers—no amount of effort or caffeine can compensate for what your cells are missing.

Modern diets, especially for office workers, rarely provide adequate micronutrient coverage. Fast food, processed meals, and skipped meals create a gap between what your body needs and what it actually gets. Over time, this gap erodes energy, cognitive performance, and even long-term health. It’s not a lack of discipline—it’s a lack of nutritional intelligence.

The solution isn’t complicated. Prioritize nutrient-dense foods: leafy greens, colorful vegetables, nuts, seeds, and lean proteins. Rotate foods to cover the spectrum of vitamins and minerals your body requires. Hydration matters too; water is the medium through which many micronutrients are transported and utilized. Even small, consistent adjustments to micronutrient intake can dramatically improve daily energy, focus, and mental clarity.

The key insight is this: energy isn’t just about calories, and focus isn’t just about willpower. Micronutrients form the foundation on which both depend. Treat them as essential, and your body and brain start performing the way they were designed to.

Don’t underestimate the tiny players in your diet—they control the performance of every system in your body. Micronutrients are the secret to sustainable energy, unwavering focus, and optimal productivity.

PMDG is offering a 60% discount on the price of their 737 for those who already own it in MSFS 2020, bringing it down to €30, and I'm reading some incredibly violent reactions, too often with blatant hatred, for €30. €30, not €300.
Thirty is the price of a cinema ticket for two people, it's the price of a meal at McDonald's for two people. 
Is it this price that makes you choke with rage?
You who are writing your message on your iPhone, your Samsung S25 or your €3,000 computer, are you whining about a €30 module? It's actually the price of a few coffees in many cities, including mine. That price, broken down to the hour of flight, is a bargain.

It's like giving jam to pigs. It's an aircraft of exceptional quality with a depth of system that few, very few of you (including me probably) are capable of using at more than 50% of its actual capabilities.

Oh my God. I see that the texture under the armrest of the second-class passengers is not in 4K! 
Oh my God... When I lower the graphics quality of MSFS 2024, it lowers the graphics quality of the 737!
Oh my God, the rivet on the inside of the pressurised cargo hold is not the right model!
Seriously... Stop whining and fly more.

Fenix are better, I read everywhere. So what? I own Fenix AND PMDG, and I'm delighted with both. I haven't found the Fenix 737 yet.

Do you think PMDG is lining its pockets? Pray that they sell their 737 well so that they have money to continue developing, if you want to see the return of the 747 one day. Pray that they sell it well if you want them to revisit the DC-6.
Do you think that developing modules for the simulation market is a mass market? I'm not so sure....Thanks to us they are rich? I'm delighted to participate, given how much I enjoy this add-on.

But above all, ABOVE ALL, if you don't like PMDG, if you think the MSFS 2024 737 is too expensive, you HAVE THE RIGHT to think so. But in that case, don't buy it. Act like a responsible adult. But finding it too expensive, buying it, scrutinising every bolt on the aircraft to find a reason to whinge online and continue to spit on PMDG is beyond me. 

PMDG owes us nothing. Absolutely nothing. They make products, they develop them at their own pace and sell them at the price they want. You don't like it? Fine, don't buy it.

Want to criticise? You can, of course. But the wave of hatred over the last few days has reached such proportions that it unfortunately leads me to believe that a large part of the PMDG customer community is made up of spoilt children who are completely out of touch with reality.

Maintain a correct altitude in 152 without autopilot. Make a clean DME arc and maintain your 3% slope without assistance. You'll have fun. And you'll rediscover your zest for life, forgetting the supreme insult that PMDG has inflicted on you...
Whinge less. Fly more. And fly safe.

It's 5:40am here, just finished my coffee,  feeling alright. 

Around 9am the cravings will start, like they do every day.  I'm not sure how I'm gonna tackle them.  I'll post here when I start feeling them.

I was doing a good job moderating but a few bad days and that all went out the window. It works until it doesn't.

The problem is I've been doing this routine of drinking every day that I don't know what else to do instead.  Like I'll get home and... then what? It's pretty much my identity now. 

It's not going to be easy.  I've overcome many things but never had success beating alcohol.  My best is 13 days. But I'm going to give it another shot.

1ps3q5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1ps3q5q/moving_to_new_orleans_in_the_coming_months/,Moving to New Orleans in the coming months,"Hello! I’m currently starting the process of finally moving to New Orleans from Southern Middle Tennessee and i cant wait to finally get out of here. I’m originally from North Alabama, lived in Denver for a year and been in Tennessee for about 4-5 years now to be a caretaker for my father who has now passed

I’m very familiar with New Orleans and the culture as i come from a French-Cajun background because my mom is from St.Bernard Parish and i grew up eating cajun food, celebrating Mardi Gras every year, seeing Mr.Bingle every Christmas and listening to my mom play Bling Bling over and over in the car when i was a kid

I’m a trans woman with disabilities who is a big car enthusiast, geek and sports enthusiast, i would love to connect with the local LGBTQ+ community, car scene and retro gaming scene, i would also like to know who or where i can connect with for healthcare and potential housing resources

I’m already a Pels fan as i’ve been following them since they were the Hornets so being able to go to both NBA and NFL games and not having to drive 3 and a half hours is already a big plus for me

I’ve visited this city many many many times but never experienced what its like to actually live here, i’ve seen people complain about the utility infrastructure but where i live currently its a hellhole with crappy internet, monthly power outages and contaminated water, i’m also a warm weather person and New Orleans checks alot of boxes for what i’m looking for so here are my questions:

1. Who can i connect to or with for LGBTQ+ related resources?

2. Whats the retro gaming scene like?

3. Best bars to go to watch sports or away games and hangout with other Pels fans?

4. What are the best places for park and chill car meets? (Cars and Coffee type events)

5. Where is the best place to start when looking for a place to live as someone with disability status?

6. What all do i need to know or prepare for prior to moving?",2,1766313708.0,AskNOLA,2,1.0,False
1ps3pvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ps3pvo/i_dont_know_why_im_posting_this_but_i_guess_i/,I don’t know why I’m posting this but I guess I don’t know what to do,"Hear me out. 

It’s 10 am on a Sunday. I’m sat with my two girls aged 3 years and 6 months, and he’s still sleeping upstairs. I feel lonely. I feel like I’m a single mother who’s stuck in this marriage. I feel stupid because I guess I should have seen the signs and just called it quits early on, before the kids and the house. 

I’m with the girls 7 days a week. I do the morning routine, I do the food, I do the night routine and I’m with them all night (yes my 3 yo still sleeps with me and my 6mo is breastfed and currently stuck to the boob). All the mental load is on me, think and plan everything, moms will know what I mean (no hate to supportive dads). There was a brief time where he would rock the baby to sleep while I had quality time with the toddler but he sneakily got out of that (by saying he must finish work but that never happened). 

I feel burnt out. I get snappy and I’m constantly angry, not with the girls but I lash out on them as well. I became someone I don’t recognize. I don’t want the girls to remember mom being always angry, I don’t want them to hear all the fights. 

If you’re here to comment „but he’s working so he’s tired”, well, I’m working too. If being a SAHM wasn’t enough of a job, between nap times and school runs I try to fit in my business on which I work from home. We bought a house last year and if it wasn’t for me we would have never been able to afford it, I pretty much covered all the deposit. We pay for most in half (mortgage, bills) but he usually covers the groceries while I buy everything for the girls from my own money. I need to plan our finances as well because he’s terrible with money. I save a good sum monthly month while he’s not saving anything.

He’s a gamer which is fine, I never said he needs to quit that, but he’s also having a drink while he plays, he smokes weed then he cant get up in the morning and that’s not okay. He got an ADHD diagnosis not long ago and now it became an excuse for everything „he can’t get up because the medication needs to kick in”, „he forgets everything I ask him to do because of adhd”, „he left our bedroom when our first daughter was born because I was a mess (which I admit I was, PPD and anxiety which hello I needed help the most) and I was pushing him away and bc of ADHD he felt rejected”.  

He rarely helps at home unless it’s because we have a fight and he would improve for a week or two and things go back to normal.

I never have time to myself. Even now I can’t even finish typing because kids constantly want my attention (which is normal but everyone needs a break). I can’t even take a sh in piece while all he does when he wakes up is take an hour long 💩 before he graces us with his presence. I feel  neglected myself, my body, I want to start moving, dressing nicely, but how tf when I can’t even take a shower between the kids and my work?

I’m not perfect. I mentioned already that I snap and we fight a lot. I get annoyed easily because how many times can you ask someone for love, for help, to play with kids, to have a coffee together in the morning as a family. I’m tired, overstimulated and if it wasn’t for my moms help I don’t know what I would have done. I struggle with depression and anxiety and am currently signing up for therapy again. But I mean, since I remember I was the only one to ever fight for this relationship. 

I think I’m past the point of working on this and I’m terrified to say this. The only thing stopping me from leaving is obviously the girls (and the house we have a mortgage on). Even though I could afford repayments on my own.

My childhood was shitty. Both parents drank, there were constant fights (some got physical, not towards me), mom left when I was entering teenage years. As an adult I thought it would have been so much better if they had gotten a divorce but never did. I always swore I would not put my kids through anything like this. And while my situation now is far from being the same, I feel like constant fights and seeing me cry or angry all the time will destroy them. I am prone to addiction as well (alcohol, I never got to the stage of addiction but I always liked my wine and knew no limits, but I then would get up in the morning and deal with adult shit anyway , I never used other stuff). I quit drinking completely when I fell pregnant with my second so am now drink free almost 1.5 years. I don’t plan on drinking again. I asked him a few times if he would help and quit drinking as well but he never did, but I guess I never pushed on it hard enough even tho I think he might have a problem too.

We barely talk and when we finally sit down to do and I try to bring up something I didn’t like he’s defensive and it ends with „you’re surprised we never talk when all you do is complain and instigate fights”, this is even when I try to have a calm conversation.

Every time I threaten divorce he just says „well if I’m that bad then go ahead and do it”.

I’m prone to depression and he knows it but he’s just making it all worse. Honestly i could continue for hours because i feel like there’s not even one good thing that i can mention right now other than my beautiful children.  

I guess I know it’s my own fault for not leaving sooner, for going on to have our second, but I guess when you love someone and hope they are able to change and they promise you that they will, you believe them. 

If you’re still reading this - thank you. I don’t know why I’m saying all of this. I needed an outlet I guess. I have no friends good enough to share this with. 

Hope you all have wonderful Christmas, and I hope the new year blesses you with love and good health ♥️

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

>""Since the 1960s, a stimulant, Ritalin (methylphenidate) has often been prescribed for hyperactive kids, because it made them able to quietly pay attention. This effect was called paradoxical, but for scientific physiology — there was nothing paradoxical about it. The frontal lobes of the brain, the most highly evolved part, give us the ability to plan and to understand complex things that require prolonged attention. Without this higher part of the brain which has a very high energy requirement, people and animals become hyperactive and unable to concentrate. Ritalin (or coffee) makes anyone, even the brightest students, more attentive and focussed. Caffeine and Ritalin temporarily raise the energy level of the brain.""

>\- 1994 - April - Ray Peat's Newsletter



I originally got diagnosed with ""depression"" ages ago, for which I however never got adequate treatment. I also do not find the diagnosis meaningful or helpful, as I always intuitively felt that there was untreated neurodivergence, trauma and ""low energy"" (turned out to be hypo) behind it. I have tried 2 antidepressants for short periods many years ago, which were all terrible (Wellbutrin-gave me muscosceletal chest pain and made me more aggressive, Citalopram-made me feel lethargic, emotionally flat, retain water and gain weight). 

I also have hypothyroidism, which I take T4 for (tried T3 and that did not work for me, gave me hyper symptoms even at the tiniest dosage. My free T3 and T4 also seem ok without). I always suspected to have some sort of neurodivergence/Autism+ADD, getting an adult diagnosis as a somewhat educated woman that seems ""healthy"" and  ""put together"" has proven to be quite difficult (I got the ""but you have a highschool degree"", ""but you have a BA"", ""but you have friends"", ""you don't look the part"" way too many times). No doc ever believed me, I do not fit the common autism and ADHD stereotype and most doctors/therapist I talked to just dismiss me, say these are ""trendy"" tiktok diagnoses etc...I was so low in energy I gave up fighting them.

As I am going back to grad school atm and am struggling and afraid of repeating my old hellish experiences when it comes to organization & concentration, my therapist agreed to let me try Ritalin/methylpheniadate without having an official diagnosis. Tbh, I don't even care about diagnoses, I just wanna trial what works and what not, then get on with life. My idea was, that I could use Ritalin during the week, then have a break on the weekend. Or ideally even to just use it as needed.

I tried 20mg methylphenidate once in the morning, that seemed way too high. Gave me insomnia, a red face and a headache. Then I tried 10mg methylphenidate, which was better in terms of focus, but I still experienced insomnia. I can also smell high ammonia, cortisol-like, chemistry-lab type sweat on me when I wake up, too. I want to go even lower to figure out the lowest but still effective dose for me. Got a script for 5mg Medikinet(also methylphenidate), gonna see how that goes... maybe it's possible to take half of that even? 

Are there some of you that have personal, non dogmatic, creative insights on how someone on methylphenidate can take in a peaty way? Is that even possible? For example by adding in other supplements/meds to soften the negative effects? I am not hung up on Ritalin having to work for me, so I am also interested to hear what other substances have worked for you.

P.S. I searched for methylphenidate here and looked at the suggestions. I already take high dose B1 daily as well as thyroid meds, which was suggested most by commenters.",3,1766313013.0,raypeat,4,1.0,False

Please excuse me if I said sth wrong and English English is my 2nd language, and for the sake of my privacy I'll call my sister ""lual"" and me ""Luna"".

      So it was Sunday and me, lual, her son and husband went to church and the service was amazing. It was all day long, we finished church around noon and we went back home, to my sister's place . Mind on our way  you we were having fun I'm playing with my nephew in the car ,lual were in the passenger seat here husband were the one who's driving. We got home everything was Normal and the help were serving the food and making coffee the my nephew was feeling sleepy so lual took him to bed and her husband went out to buy somethings. ( when those all happened it was around 10:45pm )
    I was also tired so I told the help that I was going to take a nap and when everyone  (my sister and her husband) is gathered to wake me up and went into the guest room. 
    
    Around 3:00am I woke up to find the guest room's window was open and it was really cold night and we were on the 4th floor so no one from out side could've opened it on top of that they couldn't bother to put a blanket over me .

After closing the window I went back to sleep and woke up sharp 7:00am and lual was already shouting on the help coz she did sth wrong I wasn't aware of ...I get  out bed and went straight to my sister's bed room to make her bed coz she was running late and my mom was there too ...to help with my nephew, I said good morning and started making her bed. 

     I was like what is going on in the early today and mom was telling me and suddenly my sister barge in it started shouting,cursing and insulting me.
