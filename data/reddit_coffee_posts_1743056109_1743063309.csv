1jkz0rl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jkz0rl,Living Room Set Up a,"How would you set up this living room? I have a love seat and 3 seat couch. Plus a 60” TV that’s on a cabinet style TV stand. Side tables but no coffee table. 

It’s not really a large space (the 3 seater couch would utilize the entire pony wall). 

The wall for the closet (pic 1) is wider than the bedroom wall by a couple inches. From the beam attached to the closet wall forward is clearly an addition and slopes down. Since it is the front door to the left, I have a small bench shoe rack that’s going to go on the back wall in front of the closet door. 

I was thinking of (one day) filling in the pony wall to define the space better (and square off the arched beam to match the front one over the hallway). But for now it’s this. 

The 2nd picture is from the bedroom door area to show the area the 1st picture is taken from. 

The 3rd picture is from the second (bathroom) door and is a TINY dining(?) area but shows why the pony walls (stairs down to basement) are there. Also, if you zoom in you can see how much the closet wall jets out from the bedroom wall. Right now, I have my plants by the windows and on the “ceiling” part over the stairs - which, not only do I not find aesthetically pleasing, it doesn’t extend to the living room wall. So there is this useless (about 3 to 4 inch) gap there that allows you to see between the two areas. 

It’s an older bungalow with an oddly shaped interior that I would love to do so much with, but can’t afford to do right now. So I’m stuck trying to figure out where to put things (don’t get me started on the master bedroom and that *expleteive* front closet)🤦🏼‍♀️

What started as an experiment turned into an intense 7-day coding sprint—working 14+ hours a day to complete the **Adima AI Image Upscaler Lite** app.

Here’s a quick look at the app:

🖼️ **4K AI-Powered Upscaling**  
The app allows users to upscale images up to 4K resolution using AI, with all the processing done locally on their device—no cloud uploads, just fast results.

📱 **On-Device Processing**  
Everything is handled right on the phone. No need for an internet connection or worrying about your photos being uploaded elsewhere.

⚡ **Built in 7 Days**  
In just 7 days (and a lot of coffee!), I built this app using **Java** for the backend and **Flutter** for the UI to create a lightweight, smooth experience. The goal was to keep the performance optimized for a variety of Android devices while still delivering high-quality results.

🔍 **Side-by-Side Comparison**  
There’s even a feature to compare the original and upscaled images side-by-side to see the difference in quality.

Working on this side project was both exhausting and incredibly rewarding. It was amazing to see how much can be accomplished in such a short time with the right focus and motivation. Now it’s available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aiimageupscale.adimaaiimageupscalerlite), and I’d love for you to check it out and let me know your thoughts!

If anyone else is juggling side projects or working on something similar, I’d love to hear your experiences and how you manage the intense work hours!

1jkypl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1jkypl6/liver_health_coffee_why_doctors_recommend_your/,Liver Health & Coffee: Why Doctors Recommend Your Daily Brew!,"# Introduction

Coffee is more than just a morning pick-me-up; it’s a powerhouse of health benefits, particularly for liver health. For years, researchers and health professionals have studied coffee’s effects on the liver, and the results are overwhelmingly positive. From reducing the risk of liver diseases to supporting detoxification, coffee has proven to be one of the best beverages for overall liver health.

In this article, we’ll dive deep into why doctors recommend daily coffee consumption for liver health, backed by scientific research, expert opinions, and user experiences. Let’s explore the connection between coffee and liver health.

 

# 1. Understanding Liver Health

The liver is one of the most vital organs in the body, responsible for processing nutrients, breaking down toxins, and producing bile for digestion. However, poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and sedentary lifestyles can lead to liver-related diseases such as:

·         **Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD & AFLD)** – Accumulation of fat in liver cells, leading to inflammation and damage.

·         **Cirrhosis** – Scarring of the liver due to long-term damage.

·         **Hepatitis** – Inflammation of the liver caused by viral infections or toxins.

·         **Liver Cancer** – A severe and often fatal condition resulting from chronic liver disease.

Taking care of liver health is crucial, and coffee plays an essential role in this.

 

# 2. The Science Behind Coffee’s Benefits for Liver Health

Numerous studies have shown that coffee consumption can significantly improve liver health. Here’s what the science says:

# Reduces Risk of Liver Cirrhosis

A study published in the *Journal of Hepatology* found that drinking **two or more cups of coffee per day** reduced the risk of cirrhosis by **44%**. Cirrhosis is a condition where liver tissues become scarred, leading to severe complications. Coffee helps prevent this by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.

# Lowers Risk of Liver Cancer

Research published in the *British Journal of Cancer* revealed that coffee drinkers had a **40% lower risk** of developing liver cancer. Coffee contains powerful antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acids, which help neutralize free radicals that can cause cancer.

# Prevents Fatty Liver Disease

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects millions of people worldwide. Studies suggest that coffee drinkers have a lower prevalence of **fatty liver disease**, thanks to coffee’s ability to improve liver enzyme levels and fat metabolism.

# Improves Liver Enzymes

High liver enzyme levels are a sign of liver stress or disease. Studies from the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* show that coffee consumption helps lower **ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) levels**, indicating better liver function.

 

# 3. How Coffee Supports Liver Detoxification

The liver is responsible for detoxifying harmful substances from the body. Coffee enhances this process by:

·         **Boosting glutathione production** – A powerful antioxidant that helps the liver neutralize toxins.

·         **Encouraging bile production** – Bile helps digest fats and remove waste products.

·         **Increasing blood flow** – Ensuring the liver gets enough oxygen and nutrients.

This detoxification process helps the liver function efficiently and stay healthy.

 

# 4. Expert Opinions on Coffee and Liver Health

Doctors and health professionals worldwide advocate for moderate coffee consumption for liver health. Dr. Joseph Salhab, a gastroenterologist, states:

“Coffee is one of the most beneficial beverages for liver health. It helps reduce liver inflammation, supports detoxification, and lowers the risk of chronic liver disease.”

Dr. Oliver Kennedy, a researcher from the University of Southampton, emphasizes:

“Our study found that regular coffee consumption is associated with a significant reduction in liver disease risk. This could be a game-changer for people at risk of liver problems.”

 

# 5. How Much Coffee Should You Drink for Liver Health?

While coffee offers significant liver health benefits, moderation is key. Experts recommend:

·         **2-4 cups per day** – The optimal range for liver protection.

·         **Avoid excessive sugar and cream** – Black coffee is the healthiest option.

·         **Choose quality coffee** – Organic and freshly ground coffee provides the best results.

 

# 6. Real User Experiences: How Coffee Helped Liver Patients

Many people who suffer from liver conditions have shared their positive experiences with coffee. Here are a few testimonials:

**John M. (42, New York):** “I was diagnosed with fatty liver disease last year. My doctor recommended drinking black coffee, and within six months, my liver enzyme levels improved dramatically. It’s now a daily habit for me.”

**Lisa R. (37, California):** “I’ve always been a coffee lover, but I never knew it was helping my liver. After my last check-up, my doctor told me my liver health was excellent, and coffee may have played a role.”

**David P. (50, Texas):** “After battling cirrhosis for years, I started drinking 3 cups of coffee daily. My energy levels are better, and my latest liver function tests show improvement.”

 

# 7. Best Types of Coffee for Liver Health

Not all coffee is created equal. To maximize liver health benefits, consider:

# 1. Organic Coffee

Free from pesticides and chemicals, organic coffee supports overall health without exposing the liver to harmful toxins.

# 2. Dark Roast Coffee

Studies suggest dark roast coffee contains higher levels of antioxidants and lower acidity, making it gentler on the stomach.

# 3. Black Coffee

Avoid adding sugar and cream, which can contribute to fatty liver disease. Black coffee is the purest and healthiest form.

# 4. Mushroom Coffee

Infused with superfood mushrooms like reishi and chaga, mushroom coffee offers additional liver-supporting properties.

# 8. Are There Any Risks of Drinking Coffee for Liver Health?

While coffee is beneficial, some considerations include:

·         **Caffeine Sensitivity** – Too much caffeine can cause jitters and anxiety.

·         **Acidity** – Some people may experience acid reflux with coffee.

·         **Additives** – Sugar and artificial creamers can negate coffee’s health benefits.

If you have any concerns, consult a healthcare professional before increasing your coffee intake.

 

# Conclusion: Your Daily Coffee Can Be a Liver-Saving Habit

The connection between coffee and liver health is backed by science, expert opinions, and real user experiences. Drinking **2-4 cups of black coffee daily** can help reduce the risk of liver disease, support detoxification, and improve liver enzyme levels.

If you’re looking to improve your liver health naturally, coffee is one of the best (and tastiest) ways to do so. Just make sure to choose high-quality coffee and avoid unhealthy additives.

# FAQs

**1. Can decaf coffee offer the same liver health benefits?** Yes, but regular coffee contains more antioxidants that support liver health.

**2. How soon can I see results in my liver health from drinking coffee?** Most studies show improvements within a few months of regular consumption.

**3. Can coffee replace a healthy diet for liver health?** No. Coffee should be part of a balanced diet that includes vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.

**4. Is instant coffee good for liver health?** Yes, but fresh-brewed coffee offers more antioxidants and nutrients.

**5. Can I drink coffee if I have cirrhosis?** Yes, studies suggest coffee may slow the progression of cirrhosis, but always consult your doctor first.",1,1743061700.0,u_johnsmithmath89,0,1.0,False

So a while back ago I moved into a new city, and I coincidentally live next to a small restaurant/market. At this market there is this extremely cute cashier, and I've just had the sneaking suspicion that she likes me. This isn't without reason.

I've just noticed she gives me more attention than other people she interacts with. I know this, because my roommate and I live right next to this place, and he's told me that she isn't that talkative barring basic retail interactions. That is not the reality which I've seen at all. I frequent this place a lot because they sell cheap meals, and being a student, I'm constantly in need of that, but each and every single time I go there we end up talking much longer than she does with other people. I've been going to this place every other day, so I probably see her about 3 times a week. She's currently going to school, and she's talked a lot to me about her schooling. She's also an international student, which her and I have bonded over a lot. She smiles a lot during our conversations too, and from what my friend told me, is seemingly a lot more livelier. I've also noticed she asks questions to keep the conversation going.. like I could be checked out with my groceries, and she'll still be asking questions after my transaction has gone through just so we can keep talking. 

It's actually quite sweet. I try to make sure that no customers come by during our conversations, and there have been a few times I've had to cut it short. She's also memorized what I usually get along with my groceries too, which is sweet.

Just for a bit of context too, this is a small business that's rather slow sometimes. I try my hardest not to hold any of the other customers up. I also don't want to make her or her coworkers uncomfortable at all, because I've worked retail before.

Am I overthinking it? Do I just ask her out for a cup of coffee?",1,1743061424.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.  
Kendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns.  
Kendu has many IRL products and Events and they are very important for a memecoin, as it is very attractive for potential holders. Kendu's IRL output is a testament to its strength, the fact that the community has managed this before Kendu has reached the billions, is nothing short of a miracle.  
It is plain to see where Kendu is going, we are destined for the billions.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe...  
This Certik Audit gave us an A rating, which is very good!!!

Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:🇮🇳 India,🇪🇸 Spanish,🇦🇪 Arabic, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇵🇹 Portuguese, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇨🇳 Chinese, 🇯🇵 Japanese, 🇮🇩 Indonesian, 🇰🇷 Korean, 🇹🇭 Thai, 🇹🇷 Turkish, 🇿🇦 Zulu.

**IRL Products and Event**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.

From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global

**Miami Music Week**

In 2 days Miami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)  
Kendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event. This is a great opportunity for Kendu and to go in with a green chart, the sky is the limit!!!  
NoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.

**What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**

A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, if Shib, Doge and Pepe can accomplish the billions with far less money in the market, why can't Kendu. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the 3 coins I have mentioned, so what's stopping Kendu???  
Join the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  
Skip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.  
All the signs were there...

I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)

## What to Look for in an Electric Tea Kettle with No Plastic touching Water

When shopping for an electric tea kettle with no plastic parts touching water, consider the following key features and materials:

### 1. Material Matters: Stainless Steel vs.Glass

The two primary materials used in plastic-free kettles are stainless steel and borosilicate glass.

*   **Stainless Steel:** Opt for an electric tea kettle 304 stainless steel, also known as 18/8 stainless steel. This grade is food-grade, rust-resistant, and durable. Ensure that the entire interior, including the heating element, lid, and spout, is made of stainless steel. An ""electric tea kettle all stainless steel interior"" is the ideal choice.

*   **Borosilicate Glass:** This type of glass is heat-resistant and durable, making it ideal for boiling water. If you choose a glass kettle,ensure it's made of borosilicate glass and has a stainless steel base and lid. Pay close attention to the bottom; look for ""glass kettle with stainless steel bottom"".

### 2. Check for Hidden Plastics

Even if a kettle claims to be ""plastic-free,"" carefully examine all components.sometimes, plastic is used in unexpected places, such as:

*   **Lid:** A plastic inner lid is a common culprit.
*   **Water Level Indicator:** some kettles have a plastic water level gauge inside the kettle.
*   **Filter:** Check if the filter is made of stainless steel or plastic.
*   **Spout:** Some kettles may incorporate plastic parts in the spout mechanism.

Look closely for kettles with ""electric kettle plastic free interior"" or even more precisely for ""electric kettle no plastic parts touching water.""

### 3. Safety Features

A ""safe electric kettle"" is essential. Look for kettles with the following safety features:

*   **Automatic Shut-Off:** This feature automatically turns off the kettle when the water reaches a boil, preventing overheating and potential hazards.
*   **Boil-Dry Protection:** This safety mechanism shuts off the kettle if it's accidentally turned on without water, preventing damage to the heating element.

### 4. Cordless Design

A ""cordless electric kettle no plastic"" is a convenient feature, allowing for easy pouring and filling. The kettle sits on a base connected to the power outlet, making it simple to lift and pour without being tethered to a cord.

### 5. Capacity and Wattage

Consider the capacity you need based on your household size and usage habits.Common capacities range from 1 liter to 1.7 liters. The wattage affects the boiling speed. Higher wattage kettles boil water faster, but also consume more electricity.

### 6. Ease of Cleaning

Look for kettles with a wide mouth for easy cleaning. Stainless steel kettles can sometimes develop mineral deposits; regular cleaning with vinegar can help remove them.Some glass kettles are dishwasher safe, making cleaning even more convenient.

Planning to buy groceries including oat milk in Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.

1. What oat milk brands are commonly available in Vietnamese supermarkets? (For example: Oatside, Oatly)
2. What other oat milk brands do you recommend?
3. And at what groceries can I find them? 
4. *BONUS* Any must-go Matcha tea rooms/cafes in these cities you would recommend if I were to do a matcha crawl?

I’m hoping they’re available at Lotte Mart Da Nang. Back in my home country, we have the small Oatside 200mL tetrapacks in our local 711. So I’m not sure if they’re as commonly available in Circle Ks.

1jkykxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jkykxs/trying_to_process_this_weird_talking_experience/,Trying to process this weird “talking” experience,"I (38F) have been caught in a confusing flirtation with a man and can’t see clearly through the murkiness.

We first met 20 years ago at a cabin retreat when we were 18. I was there with my then-boyfriend, and this man, an Ivy League student, sharp and funny, was part of the extended friend group. He was an acquaintance of my ex. I was attracted to him but didn’t flirt.

After my breakup (my ex treated me poorly), we occasionally crossed paths online. About 15 years ago, after moving to the same city, we chatted on Facebook, but when I suggested meeting up, he brushed me off, so I let it go.

Eight years ago, my ex died by suicide during a bipolar episode. Though we hadn’t spoken in years, it was difficult to process.

A few months ago, this man suddenly added me on Instagram and DM’d: “You’re alive and… powerful?” - likely referencing my job appearing in the news. He quickly asked me to come to his neighborhood for a “reunion”, but when I suggested a halfway point, he agreed and never followed up. A month later, he reappeared, this time overtly sexual, joking about me “delivering” myself to him and mentioning “punishing” me for delayed movie recommendations. He added that if I ever wanted to hear my name said sternly and punitively, I knew where to find him.

I’d never indicated interest in BDSM, so his assumption and sudden shift disgusted me. I didn’t respond.

Days later, he reached out again, now showing genuine interest - watching my favorite films, sending photos of his TV screen, and suggesting we meet on Valentine’s Day. Over the past five months, we’ve talked a lot and shared photos, but I’ve repeatedly delayed meeting him. He’s persistent, proposing various spots (museum, coffee, his place) but insists our first meeting be “low stakes.” He also revealed he has agoraphobia, making travel difficult, so I agreed that if we met, I’d come to him.

I do like many things about him - he’s cute, observant, funny, accomplished - but my gut keeps me from meeting. I’ve been upfront that I’m looking for a relationship, not something casual. Every time I withdraw, he floods me with messages, trying to logic me into meeting while staying vague about his intentions. He insists we won’t know if there’s romantic potential unless we meet.

One thing that unsettles me is he’s never once acknowledged my ex’s death. Not that I expect a deep conversation, but his first message - “You’re alive” - feels a little chilling in that context.

The other night, I indulged in sexting out of curiosity. I’m mildly interested in exploring CNC but his descriptions - spanking, choking, stuffing my panties in my mouth if I expressed pleasure, slipping anal in unless I begged him not to - unnerved me. When I asked if he enjoyed going down on women, he said he was open to it but preferred using “both hands.” It all felt detached, with little reciprocity or warmth.

During this, he asked me to prove we’d meet by sending a nude. I refused to send the photo he wanted but compromised with a photo of my breasts - a mistake. Since then, he’s fixated on them, constantly pushing for more. I regret it deeply, especially after making it clear I wanted something meaningful.

We sexted again recently, and I told him these acts were things I’d only explore in an exclusive, trusting relationship. He responded with “Ok :)” and later reassured me he doesn’t just see me sexually, because I’m “tied to his past, a whole mystery person from his youth whose presence will be locked into his past forever even if we never meet again.” But he ended with, “And you’re smoking hot and have great tits,” which annoyed me.

At one point, I admitted he had worn down my barriers despite my efforts to stay guarded. He latched onto this, repeating it in a sexual way. Before ending the conversation, he told me that when I’m fully “worn and beaten down” and ready to send more nudes, I should let him know.

That was days ago. I haven’t heard from him since. I think my vulnerability scared him off, and now I feel awful - ashamed for opening up, for handing him any power, and ultimately, for feeling rejected and unworthy.

I can’t make sense of why he pursued me so persistently for months if he was just after sex… but that seems to be the case. 

I guess my question is what is this guy’s deal?",2,1743061088.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1jkykrb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jkykrb,Set up help -Unable to match grind particle size of my local coffee shop.,"Hi everyone

I have a reference grind from my local coffee retailer after they noticed I was getting through a lot of coffee beans. They gave me some advice and an example coffee grind. 

I find that if I try and match their grind particle size my coffee machine fails to pump enough pressure into the basket. I’ll end up with a clogged basket and no espresso will run through. 

I have tried

- full descale
- matching their 19g coffee ratio
- cleaning the removeable basket filter with warm water
- experimenting with grind sizes (I have a manual grinder, that requires me to time it myself, usually I use my ears to determine if it sounds smooth enough)

The issue is that if I match the reference grind (last picture in the series) the coffee will not run through, it will become clogged up

Any suggestions?

1jkyib0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoLivingTrends/comments/1jkyib0/how_fully_furnished_apartments_in_munich_simplify/,How Fully Furnished Apartments in Munich Simplify Relocation,"So you're moving to Munich? Whether you're chasing a new job, enrolling in school, or just hungry for a fresh start in one of Europe’s most dynamic cities, finding a place to live tops the list of stress-inducing tasks. Packing your life into boxes is tough enough—why make it harder by renting an empty apartment?

Enter the fully furnished apartment: a modern solution to an age-old problem. You land in a new city, possibly jet-lagged, definitely overwhelmed. What you don’t need is a trip to IKEA or a crash course in German utility contracts. What you *do* need is a bed, working Wi-Fi, maybe a coffee maker—and ideally, all of it ready when you step in the door.

This isn’t just about convenience. This is about making your first few weeks (or months) in Munich livable. We’re talking sanity-saving, budget-conscious, plug-and-play housing. Let's break down why going furnished is not just an option, but the smart play.

# No Furniture, No Problem

Setting up a home from scratch in a city like Munich can be a logistical nightmare. Even if you’ve got the budget, you’re looking at delivery windows, assembly tools, and more time waiting than living. A fully furnished apartment cuts straight to the chase. You walk in, you sit down, you're home.

Think about everything you'd need: bed, sofa, dishes, lighting, towels. That stuff adds up fast—not just in cost, but in headaches. If you’re a student or working professional, your energy’s better spent on your new role or exploring the city, not measuring curtain lengths.

And for those worried about style? Many furnished apartments in Munich aren’t generic boxes. The market's stepped up. You're more likely to find Scandinavian chic or Bauhaus-inspired minimalism than worn-out hostel furniture. It’s form meeting function, which is exactly what you want when building a new life.

# Surviving the Munich Housing Gauntlet

Munich’s rental market is no joke. Competition is fierce. Places get snapped up fast. Landlords want the perfect tenant: solid income, long-term plans, spotless record. That’s tough when you're new to town and figuring it all out.

Fully furnished rentals are often managed by companies that cater to expats and short-term professionals. That means less paperwork, clearer expectations, and—sometimes—people who actually speak English. The leasing process is smoother, and you're less likely to get ghosted after your third apartment viewing.

It’s not just about beating the odds. It’s about choosing a setup that doesn’t add friction to an already complicated transition. In Munich, that’s worth its weight in bratwurst.

# The Gift of Time

Here’s a Reddit-worthy life hack: time is your most valuable currency when relocating. Furnished apartments give you back hours, even days. No calling utility companies, no mattress delivery drama, no last-minute trips to buy a kettle.

You can use that time to register at the Bürgerbüro, set up your health insurance, or just walk around the English Garden. Trust me, you’ll have enough red tape to cut through already. Every task you *don’t* have to do is a small win. String together enough of those, and suddenly you’re living, not just surviving.

Some rentals even include cleaning services or maintenance teams, which means less worrying and more living. For busy professionals or families trying to get their bearings, that’s a massive quality-of-life upgrade.

# Budgeting Without the Guesswork

One of the worst parts of relocation? Budget uncertainty. New city, new rules, new costs you didn’t see coming. That’s why furnished rentals with all-inclusive pricing are a godsend.

You know what you’re paying each month. That’s it. No surprise heating bill, no unexpected service fees. Utilities, internet, even parking—often it’s baked into the rent.

And while sticker shock might hit you at first (furnished places *can* seem pricey), you’ve got to factor in the value. No spending thousands on furniture. No losing weekends to errands. You start living right away—and in many cases, you save in the long run.

# When “Comfort” Isn’t Just a Buzzword

Relocation is tough on the brain. New environment, no routines, unfamiliar culture—it takes a toll. Having a home that feels like a *home* from the start? That can seriously stabilize your mental game.

We’re wired for comfort and familiarity. The sooner your apartment feels cozy, the sooner you start feeling like yourself again. For families, this matters tenfold. Kids adapt faster in a lived-in, welcoming space than in a half-empty echo chamber.

Even solo expats benefit big-time. You’ve got your space to recharge, reflect, and find your footing. That peace of mind? It starts with a [fully furnished apartment in Munich](https://www.vondereurope.com/location/munich) that lets you breathe.

# Munich’s Variety Game is Strong

Don’t think “furnished” means “cookie-cutter.” Munich’s got options—studio pads for solo digital nomads, spacious two-beds for relocating families, even hip lofts for creatives who need some vibe with their space.

Many of these places are curated with modern appliances, decent aesthetics, and yes, working dishwashers. You’re not stuck with soulless furniture or beige walls. If anything, you’ll get to sample the design sensibilities of the city before committing to a long-term place later.

In fact, a furnished rental might be the perfect *trial home*—a way to test neighborhoods, routines, and commutes before planting deeper roots.

# Short-Term Mindset, Long-Term Impact

Maybe you’re in Munich for a six-month contract. Maybe you’re scouting before a bigger move. Either way, locking into a year-long unfurnished lease and buying a sofa you’ll sell in four months? Probably not ideal.

Fully furnished apartments cater to people in flux. They’re designed for temporary transitions—without the friction. You can leave when the job ends, or upgrade when your partner joins you, all without hauling couches.

They’re not just homes. They’re launchpads.

# Admin Made (Sort of) Easy

If you've ever tackled German bureaucracy, you know it’s… a process. Having a registered address with proper documentation? It’s not optional—it’s your ticket to everything from your bank account to your phone plan.

Furnished apartment providers often *get* this. They’ll have the paperwork ready. They might even guide you through the Anmeldung process (that’s your official city registration, and yes, you really need it). A little help here can save days—maybe weeks—of confusion.

# Tailored to Your Situation

Whether you’re a student, consultant, family, or remote worker, there’s a furnished setup that fits. Students want proximity to campus and decent Wi-Fi. Families need space, schools, and maybe a playground. Remote workers need reliable internet and ideally a desk that doesn’t double as a dining table.

The Munich furnished market understands this. Many buildings are specifically tailored to these profiles, with shared workspaces, play areas, or community events built-in. It’s housing that *thinks* about who’s living there.

# Final Thoughs

Relocating to Munich? Go furnished. You’ll thank yourself later. It's not just about a bed and a couch—it’s about time, sanity, and momentum. Let someone else worry about the toaster. You’ve got a life to start.

The photographer sighed. ""You keep saying that...""

Hanos looked back nervously to the front of the store (we were currently in the back rooms) and at the massive line of people out there waiting to have their portraits taken, then quickly at his watch. 9:15. Vessel had booked his shoot for 9 sharp and was still showing no signs of life. Some of the prospective customers had already started to leave. No wonder the photographer guy was stressed, he thought. ""He'll be here in no time at all, just 1-2 more mins don't you worry"" Hanos smiled.

Hanos then turned to me desperately and leaned in. ""What the hell, where is he? Didn't he say he'd be here by now?! You told him right?"" he whispered.

I pondered this phrase carefully, wondering what hidden nuances Hanos was implying and what secret messages was hiding between his words. When I didn't manage to analyze anything, I tried to understand Hanos' question. Finally after 20 seconds I finally got it. ""Oh, you mean you are surprised why Vessel isn't here?"" I asked caustiously.

""Yes!"" Hanos was stressing now as well. His reputation and credibility as Vessel's manager was now on the line. I was releived to have well understood him after that short tense moment but was now in my usual chill mood and mindset once more.

""Haven't heard from Vessel since yesterday, let me check where he is and shoot him a text!"" I exclaimed. Hanos turned ghost white then, his eyes bulging. This because the photographer had heard me and was now looking seriously miffed. He gave Hanos a death stare.

Meanwhile, I was slowly texting Vessel on my old Nokia phone with the old buttons you have to click a million times just to type out one sentence. **Hey man, where are you? Btw we booked you a photoshoot and it will soon start in like 15 mins ago..** I smiled, happy to still have my Nokia phone.

Luckily, Vessel instantly read and replied to my message. **Fret not, I will soon emerge from the nearby Starbucks where I am currently chilling and obtaining a coffee - the baristas are gathering the final ingredients as we speak** (Vessel also has only Nokia phone so just waiting for his answer is like waiting for a fax, especially because he doesn't type nearly as fast as me).

When I told Hanos the update Hanos looked somewhat releived. But then he remembered he had to quickly warn the photographer about Vessel.

""Ummm, btw there's something, like just a small insignificant detail, you ought to know about which I haven't told you... Vessel... isn't here for your run-of-the-mill corporate headshot... It's more so for his new Spotify profile pic. So please just expect a guy weari- ...""

""WHAT the bloody HELL???"" the photographer shouted (he had just spotted Vessel entering the front of the store and approaching). Hanos put his face in his hands. It was no use explaining.

Vessel then entered the room and declared: ""You know that it's time to EMEE-E-EERGE!""

The photographer was honestly baffled and scared by this and nearly dropped his camera onto the floor.

""Wh-why is this guy dressed as an infinity blade character? And WHY the hell does he carry a sword?"" he looked frantically at Hanos for answers.

Vessel raised his free, trembling hand, signaling he would explain. Hanos shook his head at him. But then Vessel proceeded to look at the photographer through his mask slits intently, and answered: ""I am putting down the roses, picking up the sword...""

Then we unfortunately got promptly kicked out of the store and banned.

It's not about how primitive you go and can survive with just a knife and some rope. Although some people do, camping in general in Japan is usually not ultralight camping or dispersed camping like it is in the States.

This location at Lake Tanuki in Shizuoka Japan has shower facilities, toilets and washing stations. This campsite is unusual in the fact that even has a dedicated  parking lot and they force you to rickshaw cart your gear into the campgrounds to maintain that ""natural"" aesthetic.

- We are mainly homebodies, just want some variety of restaurants to go to or cafes to study at. Close to grocery or shopping, relatively safe. We don’t really care for bars or nightlife.

- Includes me in study groups and discussions

1jky9y3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jky9y3,"Feeling incredibly discouraged, looking for advice or commiseration","I'm 32F, 5'4"" and I'm struggling so hard right now. I've been counting calories / attempting to eat in a deficit / trying to lose weight since I was in college and have had varying levels of success, but I've really struggled and not made any progress in the past few years.


I consider myself active despite a sedentary lifestyle - I have a desk job, but regularly go to group fitness classes (typically Barry's Bootcamp/HIIT classes or spin classes), and if I can't make it to a class I lift (not especially heavy, and I'm not super consistent with it because I lift to supplement the classes - my squat and deadlift hover around 100 lb for 3 sets of 5, bench ~95 lb for 3 sets of 5, OHP ~55 lb and bent over row ~65 lb). I also occasionally will go for a run or a walk. I have a standing desk and a walking pad, although I don't use the walking pad super often because I'm still getting used to using it while working, and I pace a lot during the work day since I work from home.


As far as food goes, I like to think I eat fairly balanced - I typically have something like a slice of Trader Joe's fiber bread with cheese and turkey for breakfast, make the same salad for lunch every day (baby arugula or spinach, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, and 1-2 protein sources, typically chicken or cheese, and olive oil + vinegar). Dinner can be a little more variable if it happens at all, a lot of the time I'm out of calories by dinner and skip it or have something small. Snacking has been a problem for me because I work from home 100% of the time, and my current apartment setup has my desk fairly close to my kitchen. I try to keep the snacks to things like cherry tomatoes or cucumbers with salt, but I'll also sometimes have a little bit of cheese and an apple, or sometimes frozen fruit... or sometimes cookies. I do try not to keep junk food (cookies, chips, etc) in the house as much as possible. I have a food scale and weigh everything I eat, including each of the components in my salad, lunch meat, splashes of milk in coffee, a glass of wine after dinner, etc. 


I don't usually go out to eat - maybe a few times a month, and always just to catch up with friends. I do find that when I know I'm going out to eat, I try to eat less during the day and I always fail - I know restaurant meals will likely take up most if not all of my daily calories, and psychologically I can't seem to handle that, so I basically always go over my targets if I eat at a restaurant. I always estimate when I've gone out to a restaurant rather than skipping logging. I've been tracking food regularly since I was in college, so it's basically second nature by now.


I've had a few weekends lately where I've been away on trips and haven't logged (as you can see from the images), but I still tried to be at least a little mindful of what I was eating and didn't go too crazy, but I guess I must have given I'm not seeing the progress I'd like to be. I keep seeing people who are my height saying they recomped or even lost weight eating 1800-2000 calories a day and I'm getting so discouraged. I've had luck with intermittent fasting in the past, but I had my gallbladder removed a few years ago and IF isn't an option for me anymore. Is there anything I should be doing differently to see better progress?",1,1743059706.0,MacroFactor,4,1.0,False
1jky9vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1jky9vh/trying_to_process_this_weird_talking_experience/,Trying to process this weird “talking” experience,"I (38F) have been caught in a confusing flirtation with a man and can’t see clearly through the murkiness.

We first met 20 years ago at a cabin retreat when we were 18. I was there with my then-boyfriend, and this man, an Ivy League student, sharp and funny, was part of the extended friend group. He was an acquaintance of my ex. I was attracted to him but didn’t flirt.

After my breakup (my ex treated me poorly), we occasionally crossed paths online. About 15 years ago, after moving to the same city, we chatted on Facebook, but when I suggested meeting up, he brushed me off, so I let it go.

Eight years ago, my ex died by suicide during a bipolar episode. Though we hadn’t spoken in years, it was difficult to process.

A few months ago, this man suddenly added me on Instagram and DM’d: “You’re alive and… powerful?” - likely referencing my job appearing in the news. He quickly asked me to come to his neighborhood for a “reunion”, but when I suggested a halfway point, he agreed and never followed up. A month later, he reappeared, this time overtly sexual, joking about me “delivering” myself to him and mentioning “punishing” me for delayed movie recommendations. He added that if I ever wanted to hear my name said sternly and punitively, I knew where to find him.

I’d never indicated interest in BDSM, so his assumption and sudden shift disgusted me. I didn’t respond.

Days later, he reached out again, now showing genuine interest - watching my favorite films, sending photos of his TV screen, and suggesting we meet on Valentine’s Day. Over the past five months, we’ve talked a lot and shared photos, but I’ve repeatedly delayed meeting him. He’s persistent, proposing various spots (museum, coffee, his place) but insists our first meeting be “low stakes.” He also revealed he has agoraphobia, making travel difficult, so I agreed that if we met, I’d come to him.

I do like many things about him - he’s cute, observant, funny, accomplished - but my gut keeps me from meeting. I’ve been upfront that I’m looking for a relationship, not something casual. Every time I withdraw, he floods me with messages, trying to logic me into meeting while staying vague about his intentions. He insists we won’t know if there’s romantic potential unless we meet.

One thing that unsettles me is he’s never once acknowledged my ex’s death. Not that I expect a deep conversation, but his first message - “You’re alive” - feels a little chilling in that context.

The other night, I indulged in sexting out of curiosity. I’m mildly interested in exploring CNC but his descriptions - spanking, choking, stuffing my panties in my mouth if I expressed pleasure, slipping anal in unless I begged him not to - unnerved me. When I asked if he enjoyed going down on women, he said he was open to it but preferred using “both hands.” It all felt detached, with little reciprocity or warmth.

During this, he asked me to prove we’d meet by sending a nude. I refused to send the photo he wanted but compromised with a photo of my breasts - a mistake. Since then, he’s fixated on them, constantly pushing for more. I regret it deeply, especially after making it clear I wanted something meaningful.

We sexted again recently, and I told him these acts were things I’d only explore in an exclusive, trusting relationship. He responded with “Ok :)” and later reassured me he doesn’t just see me sexually, because I’m “tied to his past, a whole mystery person from his youth whose presence will be locked into his past forever even if we never meet again.” But he ended with, “And you’re smoking hot and have great tits,” which annoyed me.

At one point, I admitted he had worn down my barriers despite my efforts to stay guarded. He latched onto this, repeating it in a sexual way. Before ending the conversation, he told me that when I’m fully “worn and beaten down” and ready to send more nudes, I should let him know.

That was days ago. I haven’t heard from him since. I think my vulnerability scared him off, and now I feel awful - ashamed for opening up, for handing him any power, and ultimately, for feeling rejected and unworthy.

I can’t make sense of why he pursued me so persistently for months if he was just after sex… but that seems to be the case.",2,1743059697.0,WomenDatingOverForty,3,0.75,False

(Single),"I don’t know… maybe this stems from my childhood. My house was never dirty, but it definitely had its messy moments. My mom is a big-time buyer, she makes a lot of money but has never really known how to spend it with intention. So growing up, our home was always full of random stuff: toys, phones, TVs, gadgets. There was always something everywhere.

I’ve lived on my own for about six years now, and don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy a clean space. I’d even say I’m a clean person overall. But there’s something oddly comforting about coming home after a long week, when I haven’t had time to tidy up, and the house is a complete mess: stuff all over the coffee table, blankets covering the couch, there’s always that one little spot on my couch that’s cleared off just enough for me to sit like my own little throne in the chaos. Pillows scattered on the floor, water bottles everywhere, clean laundry piled on the loveseat because I “didn’t have time to hang it,” dishes in the sink, dirty clothes in the bathroom, bed unmade — the whole nine.

It’s chaotic, absolutely. But there’s something about collapsing into a bed with just a bottom sheet, two pillows, and a throw blanket. Something cozy about it. I’ll usually be naked, scrolling on my phone, with my Juul and weed pen next to me, the fan spinning above me and I swear, in that moment, it feels elite.

Now don’t get me wrong, I love a clean home too. Fresh sheets, cozy comforter, everything in its place. I do that often. But sometimes? The chaos is kind of comforting in its own way. There’s something soft and human about it. Maybe even a little freeing.

1jky3oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1jky3oa/this_really_bugs_me/,This Really Bugs Me,"There is an unfortunate problem with modern Christianity that has turned it into a ratrace, eerily resembling the toxic self-improvement community on the internet that sprang up a while ago.

The message of Christ was to love God, to love others, and to keep the Commandments to the best of your ability. It really gets as simple as that, but these people still twist it out of control. Ofcourse, this was all to be expected, but it's a very dishonest way of belief that will only repel people from Christ.

Life doesn't have to be a constant struggle, a battle like people say. Furthermore, can you call yourself saved if you at the same time, claim that every day is ""a battle"" where you ""fight your demons""? Aren't you only making yourself miserable?

This is clearly never what God commanded, and it only gets into hypocrisy when you see what they are usually trying to battle. Lust, I get. Alcohol? Who is your savior figure? What did he drink? Unless you have an addiction, you cannot seriously consider alcohol to be a sin, that is ridiculous.

These people are always the same, and I'm nobody to judge but at this point it's a rant. It's this kind of person who goes on tiktok, wearing a nice cowboy hat smoking a cigar, reading out of Paul's letter trying to fearmonger his audience by saying that you should ""enter through the narrow gate"". None of these people practice what they preach, ever, and I hate the damage that they are doing to people's minds because it's not necessarily as obvious as you would say.

In the end, this type of person is the exact same problem I faced when I was still in the world, it's always a type. It's almost as nothing really ever changes.

This is also one thing I really don't like about this type of belief. You may listen to Christian podcasts because it'll make you feel righteous, you might only watch Christian movies, you might only play ""Christian"" shooter games, but in the end, you are still indulging with the same media. It's like eating tofu, has your mind really changed?

I'm not advocating that people shouldn't watch the movies they like, but I've found that it is always these exact same people who go out of their way to spread this fearful rhetoric to others. These same people, who think watching The Chosen sets them apart, try to preach to others about what they can and cannot do.

There are lines that ought not to be crossed. But let people have their coffee at 7, and I'll let you smoke your nasty cigar.

I passed my NCLEX  and let me tell you  those last few days before the test were CRAZY. I was freaking out, but these last minute tips saved me.
1. Stop Cramming – Focus on What You Know
 The night before my NCLEX, I wanted to read EVERYTHING. Bad idea. Your brain’s already full, and cramming just makes you panic more. Instead, I grabbed my flashcards and only reviewed stuff I already kinda knew—like heart rhythms and med side effects. I told myself, “You got this,” and it calmed me down. Trust me, you’ve studied enough. Go over your strong spots, not the random junk you never got.
2. Practice the ‘Shut-Off’ Mindset
You’ve heard it shuts off at 85 questions, right? I was obsessed with that. So, I did a practice run answered 85 questions from my q  bank and stopped. I pretended it was the real deal and walked away. It got me ready for that is it over feeling. When it shut off for real at 85, I wasn’t shocked. Do this a couple times the day before it’s a game changer.
3. Sleep Like It’s Your Job
I almost pulled an all-nighter two days before, but my friend (she’s an RN now) yelled at me: “Sleep, dummy!” She was right. I slept 8 hours the night before, and my brain was sharp. No foggy head, no dumb mistakes. Skip the coffee at 10 p.m. and just rest. Your brain needs it more than one more chapter.
4. Eat Something Normal Before You Go
I saw people say “eat a big breakfast,” but no don’t mess up your stomach. I ate toast and a banana an hour before, nothing wild. Kept me full but not bloated. One girl in my test center said she ate a huge burrito and felt sick the whole time. Keep it simple so you’re not distracted by a gurgling gut.
5. Master the ‘Select All That Apply’ Trap
Those SATA questions? They’re evil. I got like 10 in a row and almost cried. Last minute, I practiced them HARD on Naxlex, whatever app you got. My trick: read each option slow and ask, “Does this fit ALONE?” Don’t overthink it. I nailed most of mine because I didn’t rush. Practice 5 of these the day before, and you’ll feel like a pro.
6. Breathe Like You Mean It
This sounds dumb, but it works. When I hit a hard question, my heart was racing. I closed my eyes, took 3 deep breaths count to 4 in, hold 4, out 4. It reset me. Do this during your test when you freak out. I saw a guy tapping his foot like crazy next to me he didn’t know this trick. You’ll look chill and think clearer.
7. Know Your Lab Values Cold
Sodium, potassium, creatinine those popped up EVERYWHERE. I wrote them on a sticky note and stuck it on my bathroom mirror. Brushed my teeth, stared at them. Day of the test, I could recite them in my sleep. Don’t skip this it’s easy points, and you’ll kick yourself if you blank.
8. Plan Your Breaks
You get breaks, but I didn’t know how to use them at first. My plan: after 50 questions, I’d pee and sip water. Kept me focused. One break, I splashed cold water on my face woke me up fast. Don’t sit there overthinking just move, reset, and get back in. It’s like a mini power-up.
9. Tell Yourself It’s Just a Test
I was shaking walking in, thinking my whole life depended on it. Then I said, It’s just a test. Worst case, I take it again.That vibe shift? Huge. I stopped sweating the “what ifs” and just answered.

1jky0ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetPeeves/comments/1jky0ej/the_pure_entitlement_around_consuming_art_and/,The pure entitlement around consuming art and media.,"It really grinds my gears how entitled people can be when it comes to consuming art and media.

We all understand that if you want a coffee, a haircut, a concert ticket, or a meat pie, you pay for it. If you can't afford it, that’s unfortunate—but no one seriously argues that they *deserve* a free haircut because they really, really like having neat hair.

But as soon as it’s a book, or a movie, or a song, suddenly it’s:

*“Well, there’s no way I could afford all the media I consume if I had to pay for it.”*

Cool story. That’s not how trade works.

Yes, I get it—it *is* different. Copying a digital file doesn’t deprive anyone else of having it. And there *are* times when pirating might be ethically justifiable: like if something’s out of print, the original creator supports it, or it's being gatekept by some broken system. I'm not here to debate all the edge cases.

What gets my goat is the *entitlement*. The attitude.

*“I’d happily buy it if it were cheaper, but the creators are greedy and charge too much!”*

Setting the price is their prerogative, because it's their creation. Just like it’s your prerogative not to buy it. That’s how trade works. If you can’t agree on a price, the creator doesn’t get the sale, and you don’t get the product. You don’t get to *dictate* a price and then feel morally justified stealing it when it doesn’t match your expectations. That’s not activism, that’s just entitlement with a coat of self-righteous paint.

And let’s be real—if you really *would* buy it at a lower price, great. Wait for a sale. Borrow it. Use your library. Don’t just act like the world owes you constant, immediate access to infinite entertainment.

Loving something doesn’t mean you’re owed it. And wanting something doesn’t mean you deserve it.

Like your gut is trying to warn you, but your brain refuses to listen?

That was me on my first night at Sunny Oaks Diner.

The place sat on the side of a lonely highway, the kind of road where headlights felt rare and the silence stretched too long between passing cars. The diner’s neon sign flickered in and out, buzzing like it was struggling to stay alive. 

The parking lot was cracked, weeds pushing through the pavement, and the windows were fogged up from the inside, giving the whole place an eerie, lived-in feeling—like the building itself was breathing. A jukebox sat in the far corner, warbling out old songs, but no one had touched it. It was just playing on its own.

I hadn’t even stepped inside yet, and already, I felt like I didn’t belong.

The manager, Reggie, didn’t bother to meet me in person. No handshake, no ""Welcome to the team,"" not even a quick phone call. Instead, my phone buzzed, and I saw a message waiting for me.

**REGGIE:** ""Check the dashboard before you clock in. Password is the same for all new hires.""

That was it. Nothing else.

No instructions. No small talk. No “let me show you around.” Just a text that felt more like a command than a welcome. Something about it rubbed me the wrong way, but I sighed, shoved my phone in my pocket, and pushed open the diner’s front door.

The inside wasn’t any better. The air smelled like old coffee and burnt toast, the kind of scent that had been baked into the walls over years of neglect. The counter was lined with red leather stools, cracked at the seams, and the booths had that sticky, worn-down feel like they’d seen decades of customers come and go.

Behind the counter sat the old computer. It was one of those ancient models with a bulky monitor, the plastic casing yellowed from time. When I jiggled the mouse, the thing groaned like I had just woken it up from a deep sleep. The screen flickered to life, showing a basic login page—plain blue background, ugly blocky font.

Four tabs.

* **Schedules**
* **Payroll**
* **Training Videos**
* **NIGHT SHIFT PROTOCOL – READ BEFORE CLOCKING IN**

That last one made my stomach twist.

I hesitated, then, out of curiosity, clicked **""Forgot Password.""**

A single security question popped up: **""What’s the secret ingredient in our famous pie?""**

I blinked. I had no idea. I hadn’t even seen the menu yet. But this was Florida, and if there was one thing Florida loved, it was key lime pie.

So I typed: **Key lime.**

The screen refreshed.

**Access granted.**

That was weird. Too easy.

Inside, the dashboard was a mess—broken links, old employee announcements from years ago, and a handful of outdated memos. Nothing useful. But my eyes locked onto the Night Shift Protocol PDF.

I clicked it open.

At first, it seemed normal. The usual corporate nonsense about keeping the place clean, being polite to customers, and making sure the cash register was balanced. But then, as I scrolled down, something changed.

The rules at the bottom weren’t normal.

They weren’t even close.

They were written in **bold.**

1. **Always keep the coffee pot full.** Even if no one’s drinking. If it runs dry, refill it immediately.
2. **If a man in a blue suit walks in, take his order, but never look him in the eyes.** He will sit at the booth in the back.
3. **You may see someone who looks exactly like you sitting at the counter. Ignore them.** Do not acknowledge their presence.
4. **At exactly 4:14 AM, go to the walk-in freezer and knock three times.** If you hear knocking back, leave the diner immediately and do not return until 5:00 AM.
5. **If a woman in a red dress asks for ""yesterday’s special,"" tell her, ""We’re all out.""** No matter what she says, do not serve her.
6. **Under no circumstances should you touch Table 6’s silverware.**

My fingers tightened on the mouse.

At the very bottom, barely readable, was one last line in faded gray text: *""Failure to follow protocol will result in immediate termination.""*

Somehow, I didn’t think they meant getting fired.

The first couple of hours were slow. The kind of slow where every minute stretched too long, where silence wasn’t just silence—it was something heavy, pressing down on me.

I did what I could to stay busy. Wiping down the counter. Refilling salt shakers. Rearranging the napkin dispensers like that somehow mattered. Anything to keep my mind from wandering too far into the rules I’d read. But no matter what I did, the feeling sat in my gut like a warning—something was off in this place.

The diner smelled like old grease and burnt coffee, the usual scents of a place like this, but underneath it, there was something else. Something sour. Like milk gone bad, or something left to rot where no one could see it. The scent clung to the back of my throat, and the more I noticed it, the harder it was to ignore.

Then, at **1:34 AM**, the doorbell jingled.

I froze.

A man in a blue suit stepped inside.

My breath caught in my chest. **Rule #2.**

**If a man in a blue suit walks in, take his order, but never look him in the eyes.** He will sit at the booth in the back.

His movements were slow—too slow. Like every step was deliberate, measured. He didn’t glance around, didn’t acknowledge me, didn’t even seem to notice the empty diner. He just moved, silent and sure, toward the booth in the back.

I kept my head down. My notepad felt slippery in my hand, and I gripped it tighter. My feet carried me forward on autopilot, my pulse loud in my ears.

Don’t look at him. Just take his order.

I stopped at his table, eyes glued to the blank page of my notepad. My voice came out steadier than I felt.

**""What can I get you?""**

For a second, there was nothing. No response. Just the hum of the jukebox playing some forgotten song.

Then, he spoke.

**""Coffee.""**

It wasn’t the word that unsettled me. It was the way he said it. His voice was wrong—too smooth, like a recording played a little too slow, like something trying too hard to sound normal but not quite getting there.

My hands shook as I grabbed the pot. I poured the coffee carefully, keeping my head down, forcing my breathing to stay even. But when I slid the cup across the table, my hand accidentally brushed his.

A deep, icy chill shot up my arm.

It wasn’t like touching cold skin. It was worse. Like touching something that had never been alive in the first place.

A low chuckle.

**""Good boy,""** he murmured.

My stomach turned. I swallowed hard, resisting the urge to run.

He chuckled again, this time softer. **""See you tomorrow, kid.""**

I didn’t know why, but that laugh made my skin crawl. It was the kind of sound that stuck to your ribs, something your body recognized as wrong even if your brain couldn’t explain why.

I turned away fast, desperate to put space between us. But as I moved, my eyes caught the reflection in the napkin dispenser.

His mouth stretched too wide.

Not in a smile. Not in anything human.

Like his skin didn’t fit right. His teeth—too white, too sharp—flashed in the dim light.

I squeezed my eyes shut and forced myself to keep walking. My hands still trembled as I reached the counter. I busied myself wiping an already-clean spot, anything to keep from looking back.

I didn’t hear him leave. But when I finally dared to glance at the booth—

He was gone.

Just the faint wisp of steam curling from the untouched cup of coffee.

It was **2:07 AM.**

The clock on the wall ticked forward, and I realized something.

If that was only my first customer, how the hell was I supposed to make it through the rest of my shift?

My chest felt tight, my mind racing to find some kind of normal in this nightmare. 

But then—I heard **Footsteps.**

Someone sat at the counter.

I turned, and my stomach plummeted.

It was me.

Same uniform. Same posture. Same exhausted expression.

But one difference—he was **grinning.**

My fingers dug into the counter. My heart pounded against my ribs. 

**Rule #3—You may see someone who looks exactly like you sitting at the counter. Ignore them.** Do not acknowledge their presence.

I forced my head down, eyes on the coffee pot, hands moving like I was focused on anything else. Like I hadn’t seen what was sitting just feet away.

But I **felt** him.

His eyes on me.

That grin stretching wider, like he knew something I didn’t.

The diner’s silence became unbearable, every second dragging longer. Then, out of nowhere—

It spoke in **my voice.**

**""You should sit down, man. You look tired.""**

It was my voice. But it wasn’t **me.**

I clenched my jaw and scrubbed harder at the counter, pretending. Ignoring. Following the rules.

A pause. Then—

**Drumming.**

The other me tapped his fingers against the countertop in a slow, steady rhythm.

**""You think the rules tell you everything?""** he asked.

I gritted my teeth. Said nothing.

The drumming continued.

**""You’re missing one.""** It said again.

A cold weight settled in my chest.

I stared at the coffee pot, my reflection warped in the glass. My own expression looked wrong—like something beneath the surface had cracked just a little.

I couldn’t let this get to me. I wouldn’t.

I took a breath, gripped the edge of the counter, and I turned away. 

But, When I looked back—

**He was gone.**

Nothing left.

Nothing except a half-empty cup of coffee sitting in front of the abandoned stool.

I never poured that.

**Missing one?**

What the hell did that mean?

The other me—whatever it was—hadn’t said anything else, just left me with that cryptic warning. But the way he said it… it didn’t feel like a joke. It felt like a clue. Or maybe a threat.

I stood behind the counter, gripping it so hard my knuckles ached. My mind spun, trying to make sense of what had just happened. The fork in the pancake, the empty coffee cup, the laugh that still rang in my ears.

This place wasn’t just haunted. It was playing by some kind of rules, and I had no idea who—or **what**—was making them.

Then, **she** walked in.

At first glance, she looked normal enough. Dark hair, sharp eyes, a red dress that fit like she belonged somewhere better than a greasy highway diner. But the second she stepped through the door, the air shifted.

It was subtle—like the temperature dropped just a little, like the diner **recognized** her.

She moved smoothly, no hesitation, sliding into a booth like she’d been here a thousand times before. Then, she smiled.

**""I'll have yesterday's special.""** She said,

My throat went dry.

**Rule #5.**

The words burned in my brain. **If a woman in a red dress asks for ""yesterday’s special,"" tell her, ""We’re all out."" No matter what she says, do not serve her.**

I swallowed hard.

**""We're all out.""** I said\*\*.\*\*

It barely came out above a whisper, but I got the words out.

Her smile didn’t move. It stayed fixed in place, like it had been painted on. Her fingers tapped lazily against the table, the rhythm slow and deliberate.

**""Are you sure?""** She asked again.

Her voice was warm, coaxing. Like she was giving me a chance to change my mind. Like she was used to people **changing their minds.**

I forced myself to breathe.

**""Yeah,""** I said, a little stronger this time. **""We don’t serve that anymore.""**

The air in the diner felt heavy, like the walls were pressing in.

For a split second, something in her expression **shifted.** Not anger, not frustration—something deeper. Something **calculating.**

Like she was trying to decide what I was worth.

Her eyes darkened just a little, and for a terrifying moment, I thought she’d lunge across the table. But then, just as quickly, she leaned back, exhaling through her nose like she’d just lost a bet.

Her nails tapped against the tabletop again.

**""You’re smarter than the last one.""** she said.

Then she stood.

No argument. No second attempt.

She just walked out.

The door swung shut behind her, and just like that, the diner **felt normal again.** Or at least, as normal as it ever got.

I let out a shaky breath, running a hand through my hair.

**""Oh my damn God,""** I muttered under my breath.

What the hell was that?

**Did they think like us?**

That was the part that scared me the most. The guy in the suit, the other me, the woman in the red dress—they weren’t just mindless things following some supernatural script. They were **watching.** Learning. Testing me.

And I had no idea what happened to the people who failed.

Suddenly, The doorbell jingled again, snapping me out of my spiraling thoughts.

A couple walked in, laughing softly as they took a seat at **Table 6.**

I stiffened.

**Rule #6.** **Under no circumstances should you touch Table 6’s silverware.**

But I couldn’t **stop** them from using it. They were customers. Just a regular couple—probably on a late-night road trip, stopping for a bite before heading back to whatever normal life they had.

I forced myself to move, to act natural. I took their order, brought them their food, and watched as they ate, completely unaware that anything was wrong.

When they finished, they left cash on the table and walked out, still chatting, still smiling.

It should’ve been fine. It should’ve been **over.**

But when I walked over to clear their plates, my stomach dropped.

One of the forks was **missing.**

I checked under the table, the seats, even inside the napkin dispenser. Nothing.

Then, as I turned back toward the counter—

I **saw it.**

A plate sat on the counter that hadn’t been there before.

A single pancake, perfectly round, like it had just been placed fresh from the griddle.

And stabbed right into the center—

Was the missing fork.

I froze.

My mouth went dry.

Slowly, **too slowly,** my gaze drifted up—

And I saw him.

The man in the blue suit.

Sitting across from the plate. Fingers tapping against the table, that slow, deliberate rhythm that I was starting to hate.

He wasn’t smiling.

**""You should really be more careful,""** he said.

My hands felt like ice. My heart pounded so hard I could feel it in my **teeth.**

**""Breaking the rules has consequences,""** he warned me again.

I didn’t move. I didn’t even **breathe.**

The jukebox stopped playing.

The hum of the old lights overhead buzzed louder.

And then—

**Everything went dark.**

For five long, suffocating seconds, the diner was pitch black.

No sounds. No movement. Just the kind of stillness that presses in on your ribs, makes you feel like something’s waiting just inches away, watching, reaching—

Then—

The lights flickered back on.

The man in the suit was **gone.**

The diner was **empty.**

Except for the plate.

The pancake was gone.

But the fork was still there—

**Driven into the table.**

Like someone had **stabbed it in hard.**

By now, nothing could surprise me.

Or so I thought.

The night had been a blur of rules and warnings, of people who weren’t people, of moments that made my skin crawl. But the worst part wasn’t what I had seen—it was knowing that something else was coming.

Something **always** came next.

At exactly **4:14 AM,** my stomach twisted.

I had almost forgotten **Rule #4.**

**At exactly 4:14 AM, go to the walk-in freezer and knock three times. If you hear knocking back, leave the diner immediately and do not return until 5:00 AM.**

I glanced at the clock, pulse quickening.

**4:14 AM.**

I swallowed hard and forced my legs to move, pushing past the swinging kitchen doors. The freezer stood at the back, its heavy steel door shut tight. My breath fogged in the cold air as I stepped closer, every instinct screaming at me to turn around.

Then, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a **dashboard notification.**

**""Follow the protocol.""**

I exhaled sharply, hand tightening around my phone.

I lifted my fist.

I knocked three times.

Silence.

For a second, I thought maybe—just **maybe**—nothing would happen. Maybe the rules were just there to mess with me, some kind of cruel initiation.

Then—**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Three Knocks, From the **inside.**

I stumbled back so fast I nearly lost my footing, my shoes slipping against the cold tile. My heartbeat thundered in my ears. My fingers twitched around my keys.

**The rule said to leave.**

I didn’t think. I just moved.

Bolting through the kitchen, I shoved open the back door and ran straight to my car. My hands were shaking so badly I fumbled the keys twice before finally jamming them into the ignition.

I didn’t drive.

I just **sat there,** gripping the wheel, waiting.

From the parking lot, I could see the diner, its windows glowing in the darkness. Everything looked **normal.**

But the freezer door—

It was open.

A figure shifted inside, barely visible through the gap.

Then, **he stepped out.**

My stomach twisted into a knot so tight I thought I’d be sick.

It was **me.**

Standing behind the counter.

Smiling.

His lips moved.

I couldn’t hear him, but I knew what he was saying.

**""You're still missing one.""**

Then, every single light in the diner **went out.**

I shouldn’t have gone back inside.

But I had to.

The moment the clock hit **5:00**, I took a deep breath and forced myself out of the car. My footsteps felt too loud as I crossed the parking lot, the neon sign above flickering weakly.

The diner was silent.

Too silent.

The door creaked as I stepped inside. The air smelled the same—burnt coffee and old grease—but something **felt** different.

Like the place was holding its breath.

I checked everything.

The man in the suit? Gone.

The other me? Gone.

The freezer door? Shut.

I should have felt relieved. I **wanted** to feel relieved. But my skin prickled with something I couldn’t shake.

Something **was wrong.**

I walked behind the counter, trying to shake off the unease. My fingers grazed the coffee pot—still warm. The counter, still wiped clean. Everything **looked** normal.

But, Then—

I heard… **Scratching.**

I froze.

The sound was faint, almost too quiet to notice.

**Scritch. Scritch. Scritch.**

It was coming from the kitchen.

I turned slowly, every muscle in my body tensed.

**This wasn’t on the rules list.**

My breath hitched as I crept forward, following the sound. The closer I got, the more distinct it became—like fingernails dragging against wood.

It was coming from the **supply closet.**

I stopped in front of the door, pulse hammering against my ribs.

The scratching paused.

Then, just as I reached for the handle—

**BANG.**

Something **slammed** against the inside of the door.

I staggered back, my heart in my throat.

And then— A voice came.

**""Let me out.""** 

It wasn’t loud.

It wasn’t frantic.

It was **calm.** Steady.

Like it knew I was standing there, frozen in fear.

I couldn’t move.

**""Let me out.""** It said Again.

No.

No, this wasn’t **right.**

I reached for the handle before my brain could stop me, fingers brushing against the cold metal—

**Wait.**

**This wasn’t in the rules.**

My blood turned to ice.

I yanked my hand back like I had been burned.

I had followed the rules all night. I had listened. Obeyed. But this?

**This wasn’t on the list.**

Which meant I had no idea what would happen if I broke it.

The scratching started again.

I swallowed my fear, took a step back, and—

**SLAMMED THE DOOR SHUT.**

With shaking hands, I twisted the lock.

Then I ran.

I grabbed my phone, fingers trembling as I pulled up the dashboard. My breath came in short, uneven gasps as I clicked into the rules.

I forced myself to type.

**Rule #7. If you hear scratching from the kitchen closet, DO NOT OPEN IT. Lock the door and leave immediately.**

The second I hit **save,** the screen **glitched.**

For half a second, the text warped—letters stretching, distorting, twisting into something unreadable.

Suddenly—I heard A breath, **Right behind me.**

A whisper brushed against my ear. 

**""Too late.""**

Ice crawled up my spine.

**A hand grabbed my wrist.**

Cold. Too cold.

I **screamed.**

I don’t remember how I got out.

One second, I was inside the diner, something cold wrapping around my wrist, whispering in my ear. The next—

I was outside.

Gasping for air.

The pavement was rough beneath me, my knees scraped raw like I had fallen. My hands **burned,** a sharp, stinging heat, like I had pressed them against a stove. I looked down, expecting blisters, expecting **something.**

But there was nothing.

The diner sat in front of me, dark and silent, like it had never been open in the first place.

The neon sign still flickered weakly, buzzing in the early morning quiet. But inside, the windows were pitch black, the kind of darkness that felt **full.**

Like something was watching from the other side.

I forced myself to my feet, legs shaking beneath me. My breathing was uneven, my body still locked in that fight-or-flight haze.

The door was shut.

The silverware?

**Back on the table.**

Neatly arranged, as if nothing had ever happened.

Like the diner had reset itself.

Like it was waiting for the next shift.

My phone buzzed.

I pulled it out with numb fingers, my pulse spiking as I saw the notification.

**DASHBOARD ERROR.**

I opened the app, stomach twisting.

The rules were **locked.**

I tried to tap them, to edit, to add more—

**Nothing.**

I couldn’t change them.

Couldn’t add anything else.

The rule about the **scratching closet** was the last one I’d ever be able to write.

And something about that sent a fresh wave of terror down my spine.

It meant the game wasn’t over.

It meant someone else would take my place.

I never went back.

I didn’t quit. Didn’t send a message. Didn’t **acknowledge** Sunny Oaks Diner in any way. I just… disappeared.

For a while, I convinced myself it was over.

Then, the next morning, my phone chimed.

A new email.

My chest tightened as I saw the sender.

**REGGIE.**

My finger hovered over the screen before I finally opened it.

**""You lasted longer than most. Hope you wrote everything down. The next guy will need it.""**

That was it.

No apology. No explanation. Just those cold, matter-of-fact words.

Like this was **normal.**

Like I was just another name on a long list of people who had tried and **failed.**

I stared at the email for a long time before finally **deleting it.**

I tried to delete the memories, too.

Tried to convince myself it was just a nightmare, a bad dream I couldn’t shake.

But sometimes—late at night, when the world is quiet and I’m alone with my thoughts—

I still **feel** it.

That cold grip around my wrist.

The whisper against my ear.

The weight of **something** standing just out of sight, watching.

I don’t know who—or what—is running that diner now.

And I don’t want to know.

But if you ever find yourself driving down a lonely stretch of highway and see a flickering neon sign for **Sunny Oaks Diner?**

Do yourself a favor.

1jkxryo,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1jkxryo/used_to_be_average_until_i_lost_the_ability_to/,Used to be average until I lost the ability to feel full; help me figure out how to get back to my old weight,"Six years ago, I rapidly gained a lot of weight and I’m ready to get back to where I used to be. Help me figure out where I should start!

**TLDR:** 33 year old woman, 5’3” (160cm) tall, 185 pounds (83.9 kg). Consume average 1,800 calories daily. Exercise average 4.5 hours of dance over per week. Weighed about 135-145 pounds my whole life until at age 27 when I completely lost my ability to feel full, potentially caused by an anti-depressant. Overly long, detailed explanation to follow. 


**Weight History:** I consistently weighed 135-145 pounds from ages 12 to 27, with the exception of a brief time when I was 23 and went up to 165 pounds over the course of half a year due to bad stomach pain that was eased when I was full so I overate (turned out I had h. pylori. Once this was treated, I went back down to my normal weight. No, weight gain is not a normal symptom of h. pylori, my body is just weird). But then from 2019 to 2020, I shot up from 140 to 195 pounds in just over a year, potentially related to a medication change. Please note, this began before the pandemic, so lack of access to a gym when COVID hit may have added to the last 15 pounds of the weight gain but not the majority of it. I suspect I must have been eating a ton of calories during this time to have gained  55 pounds so quickly but can’t confirm since I was in a brain fog for like two years. I have lost a little over 10 pounds since I began exercising regularly again three years ago but still weigh much more than I used. One exception to this was last year when I got sick with the flu and could barely eat for two months (I would eat apple sauce, a banana, and a tortilla each day) and went down to 175 pounds, but it went right back up to 185 as soon as I got better and started eating real meals again.

**Medication History:** I dealt with really bad depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD my whole life. In 2018 I started taking Zoloft, and within a year was taking up to 300mg daily. Unless the timing was a huge coincidence, this seemed to turn off the ability for my body to feel full, so I have actively felt hungry all day every day for years. I had a former friend go through something similar and gain ~100 pounds rapidly after starting Zoloft because of eating massive portions which is why I suspect this is what caused it for me too. It’s kind of a miracle I don’t eat more than I do given how hungry I am all the time, but I do suspect I must eat more calories now than I used to because of this (I never calorie counted when I was younger so I can’t actually say how much I used to eat, but I am
pretty sure the portions were smaller). I am doing better mentally and weaned myself off of Zoloft over the last two years and stopped it completely about 4 months ago, but my brain is still telling me I am hungry all the time. I mention this because if you tell me to just eat until I am satisfied, I will literally cry. The only current medications and supplements I am taking are Seasonique birth control which I started a year ago to regulate my periods and some vitamins like B12, C, D3, and E.

**Current Diet:** I consume an average of 1,800 calories a day. On special occasions like a birthday party, I might consume as much as 2,400 calories because cake, but the vast majority of days are in the 1,700-1,850 range. My daily calories includes all drinks and snacks, so if I eat 5 Cheez-Its, yes, I log these. I have about 3 cups of coffee with oat milk every day and average 1 cocktail per month, but no other drinks other than water. I am vegetarian and eat a lot of tofu and vegetables, but I also love me some carbs like tortillas, noodles, and potatoes. The actual foods I eat have been consistent since I was 19, though I used to eat much more dessert back then. My job provides food from restaurants 5 days a week and I sometimes eat a whole portion and sometimes half, but either way adjust my dinner accordingly so my total calories stay consistent. Because I am hungry all the time, if I start eating then I have a hard time stopping, so snacking tends to not work for me because it turns into a whole meal; I need to stick to three solid meals a day without snacks to keep to a reasonable calorie amount. I have never been an emotional eater or someone who eats when they’re bored, I just eat when I am genuinely feeling hungry, which is unfortunately the problem now. 

**Current Exercise:** I have dance classes 3 days a week, including a 90 minute ballet class, a 120 minute ballet class with pointe, and a 60 minute modern dance class. On the days I don’t dance, I usually go on a short walk or do some light exercises at home 2 of the days and am lazy and do nothing the other 2 days. Before the pandemic, I went to a gym twice a week to attend 60 minute weight lifting classes twice a week, but since my old gym closed 5 years ago when the Pandemic hit, I have not done much weight lifting. I struggle to exercise for longer than 15 minutes on my own outside of a class setting; I need peer pressure to stick with a whole hour. I have a desk job and don’t move much if I am not intentionally exercising or going on walks.

**Family History:** My father was very overweight and had type 2 diabetes. His whole family is overweight but not as much as he was. My mother is overweight and has hypothyroidism but my recent thyroid tests tell me I do not. Her whole family is very thin so she is the one outlier.

**What Doctors Say:** My primary care physician was like idk, so she sent me to a bariatric doctor who has no idea what the root cause of my problem is, but wants to put me on medication to address the effect. She at first recommended Zepbound but my insurance won’t pay for it since my BMI is less than 40, so instead she has recommended Qsymia (Phentermine and Topiramate). She has told me that whatever medication I go on, I will need to plan to be on it for the rest of my life since otherwise I will gain the weight back, which has made me hesitant to start but if it’s the only thing that can help, then I will try it. 


So here I am on Reddit for a last ditch effort to see if anyone else has had a similar experience and has any advice. I just want my body to be able to feel full again like it used to! And regarding weight loss, I assume I must be eating too much or not doing the right kind of exercise, so any specific advice on this would be helpful!",1,1743057497.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

I met Charles in September 2024 while playing a racket sport. He was a great player, and we clicked instantly. At the time, I was in a relationship. Shortly after meeting my friends, Charles showed interest in my friend Ava and asked for her number. I told him to come to our run club instead, so she could give it to him herself. He showed up, despite his busy schedule, but Ava didn’t. We ended up running 2.5 miles together, struggling and laughing the whole way. I apologized that she hadn’t come, but it felt like we had a great time anyway.

By mid-November, I finally broke up with my boyfriend—something I’d been wanting to do since July. Our friend group went to a big Christmas market, and I hadn’t seen Charles in a while. The moment he found out I was single, something shifted between us. We locked eyes differently. He looked great that night, and I even told him so. Afterward, I texted him, joking that my brother wouldn’t get food with me, and Charles immediately suggested we go together. We ended up at a restaurant, staying until 11 PM, talking long after the waiters had started their own dinners.

A week later, at a group dancing event, we danced together, but my friend Ximena showed interest in him. The following week, I invited Charles to go dancing just us again. He met my parents that night, and we spent the evening playing pool, talking by the fire pit, and eating burgers with terrible fries. It was a great night. Then, I didn’t see him all of December as his father was undergoing surgery for cancer.

In January, our group started playing sports again. Ximena lost my ball, and Charles spent 20 minutes searching for it. He couldn’t reach it, but I appreciated the effort. **That day, I made a mistake—I was more focused on a new guy, Jacob, and Charles noticed.** He started talking to Ximena more. Later, he bought milkshakes for the whole group, and when I joined him to pick them up, we flirted. A few days later, he told me he had bought me a new ball, but I told him to keep it.

Two weeks later, at a UFC watch party (just my brother, his gf Tess and I) we flirted all night, and when it was time to leave, I suggested getting dessert. I lingered in my car instead of heading home, and he texted, “**Sounds like you didn’t want the night to end**.” I admitted I didn’t and offered to grab dessert before heading to his place. We spent the whole night talking about our pasts and flipping through his photos. I left at 3 AM—still too nervous to initiate anything.

Then, I met Bruce at church, and my focus shifted even more. A week after meeting Bruce, the group played sports again, **I invited Charles to eat with us since he couldn’t make it, only to find out Ximena had invited him too. That’s when I realized he was entertaining both of us at the same time.** I didn’t mind—I was talking to Bruce anyway—**so I let Charles go.**

February rolled around. At a Super Bowl party, I noticed Charles and Ximena getting close. She watched my interactions with him carefully. When I left, I only said goodbye to him. Bruce and I had faded out at this point.

On Valentine’s Day, our group went dancing, and Ava confessed that she liked Charles too. **Now, I had two friends into him.** At the bar, I told Charles, “**Apparently Ava likes you too. I’m out—I’d rather not deal with the drama**.” He looked disappointed. That night, he drove Ximena home, and my brother’s girlfriend later told me they kissed. Ximena knew Charles and I had been seeing each other but never asked if it was okay. She likely assumed my feelings were gone because of Bruce. I get it—but it still felt like a fake friend move.

In March, at another sports day, I wanted to team up with Charles, but Macy, another friend, complained that he was ditching her. I realized Macy now liked him too. In a group dinner afterward, my brother jokingly suggested Charles cook for Macy, thinking they had something going on. Later, Charles confided in my brother’s girlfriend, Tess, that the comment upset him. He also told Macy and Tess that he felt I never reciprocated his feelings—which isn’t true. He was pursuing Ximena, and Ava’s interest only added to the mess.

Then, my brother told me that Charles’s dad’s cancer had returned. I had known before and never mentioned it to anyone, but now, with everything happening, I reached out to Charles and let him know I was praying for him. The following week, at a tournament, he looked visibly upset. Wanting to cheer him up, I baked him cookies. I texted him to ask if he’d be home around 7 PM—he wasn’t—so I left them with the concierge and went to play sports with my church friends. He later texted me, “That was really kind of you. You didn’t have to do that.” He then asked what my plans were for the night, but I forgot to respond until 10 PM.

At a concert with my girlfriends, I told them I didn’t want to be involved in the Charles drama anymore. That’s when Ava revealed she had gotten coffee with him but made it clear that it wasn’t a date. **I felt a little regret—had I lost Charles because of my side-quests?** Ava also told me Charles said he never had a thing with Macy—**which was a lie, because I knew they had cuddled. And I knew he and Ximena had slept together.**

So, Charles lied to Ava. And now he told Macy that he was taking a break from everything. That’s probably a lie too—he’s likely going to pursue Ava, the girl he originally had his eyes on. We’ve come full circle.

Here’s where I stand: I want to keep Charles as a friend. He’s 25 and clearly not ready for something serious. I’m 23—I can wait. That moment at the Christmas market still lingers in my mind. I confided in his friend Isaiah that I wasn’t looking for a relationship right now, just enjoying my singleness (without sleeping around, of course). Isaiah responded, “I know you’re not that type of woman.”

Maybe one day, when the timing is right, Charles and I will find our way back to each other. But for now? I’ll let things be.

**TL;DR:** Met Charles in Sept 2024 while in a relationship. He liked my friend Ava first but she wasn’t interested. After my breakup in Nov, Charles and I grew closer—late-night talks, dancing, and hanging out—but I never made a move. In Jan, I shifted focus to Bruce, and Charles started entertaining my friend Ximena. By Feb, Ximena and Charles were a thing, but Ava suddenly liked him too. I backed off to avoid drama, as Ximena and Charles had kissed/slept together. In March, Macy entered the picture, also liking Charles. I later found out he was seeing multiple girls while saying he wasn’t. Now, I just want to keep him as a friend, but I wonder—did I fumble or dodge a bullet?",1,1743056845.0,dating,2,1.0,False

So I asked ChatGPT for a detailed breakdown, and here's what I found:

☕ **Coffee & Uric Acid**

* Coffee contains **caffeine**, which is a **xanthine compound** (similar to purines). When metabolized, it may increase **uric acid production**.
* **Diuretic effect**: Coffee makes you pee more, which **can lead to dehydration**, slowing down uric acid excretion.
* **Insulin resistance link**: Insulin helps the kidneys clear uric acid. If coffee **reduces insulin sensitivity**, uric acid levels may rise.
* **Timing matters**: Morning coffee might be fine, but drinking it **late in the evening** can mess with metabolism and uric acid clearance.",2,1743056429.0,gout,4,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

Memphis’ last 3 straight losses have all been by more than 10 points. And, to be frank, they lost by 10+ to teams that are no where near as formidable as OKC. I hate to say it, but the Grizzlies just aren’t the same well-oiled basketball machine that they were before the All-Star break. To boot, Oklahoma City took the Grizzlies to task just a few weeks ago, winning by a whopping 17 points. With the home advantage and a 7-game win streak under their belt, I have to go with the Thunder to cover here.
