1huvpvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/capetown/comments/1huvpvm/friends_with_adhd_or_asd/,Friends with ADHD or ASD,"Hi all üëã

I would like to meet and connect with individuals who has ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder.

I have ADHD (diagnosed) and I've been struggling quite a lot with some of the symptoms, especially with procrastination and screen addiction.

My psychiatrist believes I might also have high-functioning autism (it used to be called Asperger's Syndrome) and borderline personality disorder.

I've previously posted on this group in search of friends, but I would really like to meet up and chat with people 'whom' (?) I can form long-term friendships with.

A little bit about myself: I'm a 37 year old male professional. I live in Tokai area, but I'm mobile and I don't mind driving to meet up. I live alone and I work from home. I typically enjoy deep conversations ranging from science (physics, astronomy, computer) and mathematics, philosophy, history, psychology, politics, and gaming. Note: The previous list is not exhaustive and I enjoy a wide range of topics. I enjoy debates too. I can do small talk to some extent, but it gets boring quick.

I really, really love being outdoors in natural and foresty environments, and Cape Town is filled with nature-lovers ‚ù§Ô∏è and plenty tranquil and scenic natural environments.

I would love to be surrounded by or be friends with positive people. I know, it's not realistic to expect any human to be consistently positive, but it's more about our outlook and perspective of the world.

I also appreciate pragmatism, realism and intellectual honesty.

Please reach out if you would like to connect over a cup of coffee, tea, beer, or 'green herbs' (depending on the setting, day, and time).",3,1736157773.0,capetown,0,1.0,False

Its been a while since the last time na nag-away kmi ng malala. Last Saturday, pumasok sya sa office (pinapa-OT sya ng boss nya). I have no issues nmn sa pag OT nya, work nya yan eh. The only issue I have ay nacoconsume ng trabaho nya pati personal time nya. We were suppose to drop-off our laundry and do some groceries na din after ng OT nya. Half day lng dapat sya ksi wala nmn tlg dpat syang work ng Saturday. I decided to grab lunch and watch a movie with a friend tpos sinabi ko na aantayin ko na sya para sabay na kmi umuwi. Tinawagan ko sya after the movie and sbi nya extended daw yung OT and possible na around 4 or 5 sya lalabas. Edi okay, again wala sakin issue yun kaya inalok ko c friend na mag coffee na lng muna kmi pra na din to kill time. Around 4pm, I called pero walang sagot kaya I chatted him and jokingly said ""sobrang busy yan? uwi na lng ako ksi d ka sumasagot"". wala parin response despite of him knowing na nag-aantay ako.

Past 5, umuwi na yung friend ko and I keep calling him. No answer parin. Ni reply sa chat ko wala. Naglakad ako papunta sa harap ng office nila nagbakasakali na bka lumabas sya or baka naiwan yung phone or something. Wala. Past 6pm, naglakad na ako papunta sakayan ng jeep para umuwi na lng. Tried calling him parin multiple times pero no answer. Nagworry na ako ksi baka napano na sya or what. I tried looking for their company number at buti nakita ko sa google. I called and sya yung sumagot and told him na I keep calling him sa phone nya. Ang sagot lng sakin ""naka charge"". Then binaba ko na yung tawag.

Ang nakakainis lng at nakakasama ng loob, ang reply lng sakin ""sorry, d pa ako tapos (sa OT works). Akala ko umuwi ka na""

Putang ina, ano ba nmn yung onting time na magchat sakin and sabihan ako na ""d pa ako tapos, una ka na umuwi"" hndi yung iiwan ako sa ere despite na alam nya na nag-aantay ako.

Ni pag-uwi nya sa bahay, ni wala ako narinig sa ""sorry"" manlng na galing sakanya in person. Ni walang explanation na binigay sakin. Wala. Pinapagmukha nnmn ako nitong tanga.

Bigla na lng ako na drain sa relasyon namin. D na din ako gaano kumikibo. Mukhang mas preferred nya yung ganito. Hndi na din ako nag-aasikaso ng gamit nya and babaunin nya bago sya pumasok sa work. Ewan ko, malapit na ako mawalan tlg ng pake. Pakiramdam ko, sooner or later, ang tingin ko na lng sakanya eh room mate. nothing more.",1,1736157612.0,AlasFeels,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 29F and I do not drink nor do I smoke. I do drink soda sometimes and I don‚Äôt drink coffee. I have gingivitis and unfortunately my gums have receded (it is a mild gum loss) but I can still feel the sensitivity change on my teeth when I consume cold drinks. 

I floss once a day and brush my teeth sometimes twice a day but I do brush it once a day every day. I use an electric Phillips toothbrush and I use sensodyme gum sensitivity toothpaste and I did not have an issue with that toothpaste. But I tried Parodontax Gum Repair and I feel my sensitivity is worse. I did use Listerine alcohol free for a while but I noticed this white substance and thought it was a bad thing so I have not been using mouth wash. I noticed when I use mouth wash it seems to increase this white film substance. I tried Listerine gum therapy for one day and felt it didn‚Äôt help. 

I do not have thrush. 

Over all I‚Äôm confused on how to manage my gum health. I noticed in the upper right my gum has receded significantly. And I didn‚Äôt notice it looking that way before. 

Recap: I‚Äùm confused on what I‚Äôm doing wrong? Increase teeth sensitivity, gum loss. 
I floss. I brush my teeth. I use mouth wash normally but haven‚Äôt lately due to this film substance. I have gingivitis. I don‚Äôt want to get periodontal disease.

So if you could posses the body of anyone who would you choose most zombies chose rich old white men. You ever wonder why there are so many of those guys about. Ever looked at a politician and thought couldn't you just die and let someone younger take charge. Well fun fact they have. But there are some problems with this there are only a few rich old men bodies left so the zombies are getting desperate. 

I bring this up of course because the rich old white man standing in front of my counter if Jeffrey Epstein. 

""Hello"" He said sheepishly. 

""Hello mr Epstein."" 

""I have recently came upon some information about the former host of this body, and I was wondering if there was anything you sell me to help my situation?"" He said trying to keep away from any aligations as of I might not have heard about it already. 

""Yeah. Are you wanting to keep the body or exchange it for another?"" 

""I would like to exchange it."" 

""Are you looking for another rich old dude or?"" 

""I'll take anything at this point just not someone like this if you understand?"" 

""Yeah I understand we have a bunch of old frankenstein's monster parts from the whole 5 Minute Crafts craze a few years back. I'm sure we can peice some things together for you."" 

Now this may seem like a small shop but it's actually pretty big. We have lots of departments like the coffee shop, garden department, pet section and as previously mentioned in my last post about the monsters hunter the adult section. As we are going through each of them. Lucy from the pet section comes running up to me. Out of breath she quickly says. 

""Hey Jess I've lost a Tailypo!"" 

""What's a Tailypo?"" I respond having never heard of Tailypo. 

""It's a small furry creature. Yellowish red eyes. Tufted ears. Likes the dark and most importantly."" 

She has a slight pause before noticing my customer. 

""Sorry is that Jeffrey Epstein?"" 

""He's a rather unfortunate zombie."" I respond. ""Were getting him some new body parts but if we see the thing you said about we'll either try to catch it or get you."" 

""OK"" said Lucy. ""Just watch out for it's tail."" 

So as we get through the rest of the shop we enter the warehouse where we keep the spare body parts. Unfortunately I don't know where the spare body parts are. Fortunately I know that Jack the warehouse manager would know where they are. Unfortunately again I don't know where Jack is. 

""JACK!"" I yell into the dark void that is the warehouse. ""JACK WHERE ARE YOU!"" 

""I AM OVER HERE! WHAT DO IS IT YOU DESIRE"" I hear a gruff voice somewhere to the left of me. 

""WE NEED THOSE SPARE FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER PARTS!"" I yell over to him. 

""AH YES THE 5 MINUTE CRAFTS CRAZE A FEW YEARS AGO! THEY ARE SOMEWHAT NEAR TO ME JUST FOLLOW MY VOICE!"" 

I have to say though it is unusual normally Jack would have lit a torch. Hey there he is. 

We have to look up to see Jack the red dragon peering over us. Standing next to a pile of copses and detached limbs. His large green eyes perfectly suited to finding anything from across the warehouse. And naturally occurring treasure keeping tendencies allowing the warehouse to be perfectly in order. 

""AH HELLO DEAR JESS. LOOKING FOR MONSTER PARTS ARE WE."" 

""Yes this unfortunate zombie has possessed a body with some negative associations. So we need a new one."" 

""HMM YES THAT IS QUITE A PREDICEMENT. THANKFULLY I HAVE KEPT SOME PARTS SO THEY ARE WELCOME TO BUY A NEW BODY."" 

""Yeah I'm sure there are some matching parts here sorry are you OK with Mr Epstein or would you prefer something else."" 

""Craig will do."" the zombie replied. 

""OK Craig so what will we be getting for you today."" 

""Hm I don't really know. I guess just something with a good few years before it decomposes."" 

""Yeah so we're wanting something newer. You got an age range in mind? A gender maybe?"" 

""Probably something a little older. Male. Preferably black hair if you have any."" 

""Yeah OK so would this work for you?"" I say as I pull a body out of the pile. 

""Hm yeah that works."" Craig says as he sees the handsome mid 40s body with black hair. 

As I look to see another happy customer I notice a small furry yellowish red eyed creature with tufted ears. 

""Craig there's a Tailypo on your head. Please do not move."" 

As I slowly edge towards the creature on his head I notice its tail now with a name like the Tailypo you would expect it to have an impressive tail. However not really it was a wiry little thing with strands of hair sticking out of it. Now this was not impressive however the Tailypo ripping its tail of and throwing it at me was both unexpected and impressive. 

""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! Oh my god it ripped its tail off."" 

I watch as the now tailless Tailypo scampered of in-between shelving units. As I pick up its tail I guide Craig back to the counter promising him use of my staff discount if he doesn't sumon my manager on me or Lucy. 

As I hand the tail to Lucy she looks extremely pleased saying something about how as long as no-one eats it the Tailypo should come back to retrieve their tail. 

As me and Craig return to the counter we we come to the agreement of ¬£150 for the body which he agrees is well worth it for no more misunderstandings with any hit men.",1,1736156889.0,nosleeep,0,1.0,False

2. Breakfast: 1 boiled egg/omelette, 1 chapati/2 tablespoons of rice (not able to eat more!), good portion of palya (sabzi) - around 9-9.30 am

3. Lunch: 1 chapati with 2 different palyas - 2 small cups, 2 tablespoons of rice (feel very full after eating rice), small cup of dal, small cup of curd, a small cup of salad - around 1-1.30 pm

4. Dinner: 2-3 tablespoons of rice with palya.

Lots of black coffee in between. Fresh fruits/cucumber as and when hungry (can't eat more than 1 fruit at a time)

Last week, I felt super full on eating half idli (medium sized). I'm just constantly hungry but as soon as I eat something as good as a piece of fruit, I reach satiety. Not sure what physiological changes are going on. 

Some day, I feel super light and alert. On some days, I'm angry/annoyed. On some other days, I feel tired and lethargic.

Whether you‚Äôre an aspiring barista or a homebrew enthusiast, understanding the core components of an espresso machine is key to elevating your coffee game. Let‚Äôs break it down:

# 1 The Group Head

This is the heart of the espresso machine and where the magic begins.

* **Function:** It‚Äôs the part where you attach the portafilter, and water is forced through the coffee grounds.
* **Why It‚Äôs Important:** A consistent group head ensures even extraction, which is critical for a balanced flavor profile.
* **Pro Tip:** Keep it clean! Residue buildup can impact taste.

# 2 The Portafilter

The portafilter is where you pack your finely ground coffee.

* **Types:** Comes in different sizes and styles (e.g., pressurized vs. non-pressurized).
* **Why It‚Äôs Important:** A well-packed portafilter ensures the right pressure and extraction time.
* **Fun Fact:** The term ‚Äúportafilter‚Äù literally means ""portable filter."" 

# 3 The Boiler System

Think of this as the engine powering your espresso machine.

* **Function:** Heats and maintains water at the precise temperature needed for brewing (usually around 195-205¬∞F).
* **Types:** Single, dual, or heat exchange boilers, each impacting how you steam milk and brew espresso simultaneously.
* **Why It‚Äôs Important:** Inconsistent water temperature = inconsistent espresso. Nobody wants that!

# 4 The Steam Wand

For all the latte and cappuccino lovers out there, this is your MVP.

* **Function:** Steams and froths milk to create those creamy textures and velvety microfoam.
* **Why It‚Äôs Important:** The steam wand‚Äôs angle, power, and ease of use can make or break your latte art game. 
* **Pro Tip:** Always purge the wand before and after use to prevent milk buildup!

# Bonus Tips for Espresso Machine Care:

* **Descale Regularly:** Hard water can wreak havoc on your machine.
* **Use Fresh Beans:** A great espresso starts with quality coffee.
* **Experiment:** Play with grind size, tamping pressure, and water temperature to find your sweet spot.

Yesterday I had something nice for morning meal. Mom made it, it was nice and low calories and I workout in the afternoon and by the time I was supposed to go to the gym, I was already hungry, so I made myself some popcorn and black tea (no sugar). After workout I had coffee and choco pie. I was pretty happy because I had something sweet and didn't want food and didn't make anything for myself as I was the one making dinner for the whole family. Mom was pissed when I said I don't want to eat and have only made food for them because she wanted me to make myself something specific (she was like ""you should make this for yourself and eat""), but I didn't take anything she said seriously because I was happy and was almost at my target calorie limit.

This morning she goes on a rant about how some people are born to be slaves to their own desires and how I am an animal and even worse than an animal because even animal knows what they should eat or not. And the people who are slaves get treated like slaves by the world and how she is a master not a slave and I should learn from her. I was studying and didn't want to take her seriously as it would ruin my mood, so after saying ""mom stop"", ""it's enough"" multiple times and she going on even more unhinged rants about how everyone sees me as a slave and I deserve it, I just went lalallalalalalalalla to drown out whatever she was saying. Now she is pissed at me saying not even a 3 year old goes lalallala when someone says something they don't want to hear and I need to listen to what she says because she just wants best for me and if I can't hear such simple words I will always be a loser and a slave.

Especially with more lifestyle content, I am struggling to figure out which posts/stories are ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a thing I did/liked‚Äù vs ones that she was gifted/partnered/sponsored etc. Like Tillamook & Hanna are almost always disclosed with #AD or #hannapartners. C&B is now obvious because of the line of home goods, but when there were previous home decor content posts (eg Poppy‚Äôs nursery and then big girl room, also the backyard revamp) I remember wondering if she just loved C&B or if they were paying her/gifting all that furniture. Lately the Rosewood hotels are the one that have me scratching my head - is there some partnership or does she just love their hotels so much that she‚Äôs as loyal as my old boss was for his Marriott points? I‚Äôve never seen any disclosures, but now there‚Äôs more story highlights and always lots of posts about how amazing they are. I appreciate that Gaby‚Äôs space is positive and she never posts about ‚Äúmeh‚Äù experiences or criticisms of anything (like if she doesn‚Äôt like a restaurant, I‚Äôm assuming she won‚Äôt post). But with a lot of businesses that get tagged with rave reviews but no sponsorship/gifting disclosures, I am now confused whether even the meals out or anything else ever mentioned is comped/discounted/affiliated or if she‚Äôs just sharing the best of the best. Things like Woah Nelly catering, swim teacher/personal trainer, the $400 athleisure outfits, coffee from a cafe her friends own, etc.

Maybe I‚Äôm just old, but by feeling like more is sponsored/gifted than what is disclosed, I then second guess whether to try other things endorsed or do my own research first. I‚Äôm not saying to do the whole ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt paid to post this, I just love this product so much‚Äù thing that some smaller content creators do, rather disclosing ones that do have a tie would clear up that those that aren‚Äôt disclosed are very much not sponsored.

(Before anyone comes after me with pitchforks - I realize she & Matt respond here sometimes - I follow her for the recipe content (which have mostly been hits when I cook) and she clearly works hard AF not just to have built her brand but to also be sustaining it as well as she had - I‚Äôve been following her for like 6 years! Heck, if I could take free vacations (or be paid for them) and not have to deal with the headaches of furniture and clothes shopping, I would in a heartbeat! Just some disclosure would be helpful - or confirmation that beyond the few that are explicitly tagged, all others are completely unsolicited endorsements or otherwise unaffiliated tags to avoid a million DMs asking for a link.)",2,1736154357.0,FoodieSnark,0,1.0,False

**Best For:** Hardcore espresso enthusiasts who want total control over their coffee and don't mind the effort.

# 2. Semi-Automatic Espresso Machines 

**What it is:** These machines use an electric pump to create the pressure needed for extraction. You control the grinding, tamping, and extraction timing, but the pump does the heavy lifting.

**Pros:**

* Easier to use than manual machines while retaining control over key brewing elements.
* Widely available with models ranging from beginner to professional-level.
* Great balance of automation and manual control.

**Cons:**

* Requires some skill, especially for beginners.
* You still need to learn grinding and tamping techniques for the best results.

**Best For:** Coffee lovers who want a hands-on experience without the hassle of a fully manual process.

# 3. Automatic (and Super-Automatic) Espresso Machines 

**What it is:** Fully automated machines handle everything from grinding the beans to pulling the shot. Super-automatic machines even include milk frothing capabilities for lattes and cappuccinos.

**Pros:**

* Extremely user-friendly‚Äîjust press a button!
* Consistent results with minimal effort.
* Great for those who want coffee fast and fuss-free.

**Cons:**

* Limited control over brewing variables.
* Typically more expensive than manual or semi-automatic machines.

**Best For:** Busy individuals who want quality espresso with zero hassle or cleanup.

# Which One Is Right for You?

Here‚Äôs a quick guide to help you decide:

|**Machine Type**|**Who It's For**|
|:-|:-|
|**Manual**|Espresso purists who enjoy the process.|
|**Semi-Automatic**|Those who want a balance of control and ease.|
|**Automatic/Super**|People who value convenience over control.|

The right espresso machine depends on your priorities: **Do you love experimenting, or do you need convenience?** If you‚Äôre still unsure, try starting with a semi-automatic machine‚Äîit‚Äôs the perfect middle ground!

I have tried a few different layouts but haven't settled on one that feels right. One thing I have found challenging is the room has three doorways (one into the room, one into the kitchen, and one to the balcony) so I try to keep walking space which makes it feel like everything is up against a wall.

I have just replaced my dining table to this 2-seater extendable table, and am considering replacing either one of or both the sofa and coffee table, both of which feel a bit large for the space.

But how do you choose the right one with so many options available? Here's a guide to help you make the perfect choice! 

#  Key Features of a High-Quality Espresso Machine:

1. **Durability**: Look for machines with a robust build, ideally made from stainless steel or similar materials for longevity.
2. **Pressure Control**: Machines with at least 15 bars of pressure ensure optimal espresso extraction, delivering that rich, crema-topped shot.
3. **Ease of Use**: Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an experienced home barista, choose a machine that matches your comfort level‚Äîsimple controls for beginners and more customization for advanced users.
4. **Temperature Stability**: A machine with precise temperature control ensures consistent results with every shot.
5. **Steam Wand for Milk Frothing**: If you love lattes or cappuccinos, a machine with a high-quality steam wand is a must.
6. **Compact Size**: For those with limited counter space, a compact model can save you headaches while still delivering great results.

# Types of Espresso Machines to Consider:

1. **Manual Machines**: Perfect for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy total control over the brewing process. These machines require skill but deliver unmatched satisfaction for purists.
2. **Semi-Automatic Machines**: A balance between control and convenience. You manage the grind size and tamping, while the machine handles water pressure and extraction.
3. **Fully Automatic Machines**: Great for busy individuals who want a quick, consistent espresso with minimal effort. Fully automatic machines often include one-touch features for lattes and cappuccinos.

#  How to Choose the Right Machine:

* **Skill Level**: Are you a beginner, an intermediate coffee enthusiast, or an experienced barista? Choose a machine that matches your expertise.
* **Budget**: High-quality machines range from entry-level options to professional-grade models. Identify your price range before you start shopping.
* **Usage Frequency**: For daily use, invest in a durable, reliable machine. For occasional use, a simpler model may suffice.
* **Coffee Preferences**: Do you prefer straight espresso shots or milk-based drinks? Ensure the machine supports your favorite beverages.
* **Counter Space**: Consider the size of the machine and your available kitchen space.

#  Pro Tips for Espresso Success:

* **Fresh Coffee**: Always use freshly ground coffee for the best flavor. Pair your machine with a good grinder for consistency.
* **Practice Makes Perfect**: Experiment with grind size, tamping pressure, and extraction time to achieve your ideal shot.
* **Maintenance**: Clean your machine regularly to maintain its performance and longevity.

","Creating the perfect office space goes beyond just functional furniture. It's about combining comfort, style, and efficiency to boost your mood and productivity. Whether you work from home or in a corporate setting, having the right [**cool things for my office**](https://cartio.com.au/) can make a huge difference in your day-to-day work experience.

Here are some awesome office ideas that not only look great but also help optimize your work environment:

# 1. Ergonomic Chair

An ergonomic chair is essential for long hours of work. It helps support your back, encourages better posture, and can prevent discomfort. Look for one with adjustable height, lumbar support, and armrests to keep you comfortable throughout the day.

# 2. Standing Desk

A standing desk allows you to switch between sitting and standing positions, promoting better circulation and reducing the risks associated with prolonged sitting. Many models are adjustable, making it easy to find the perfect height for your work.

# 3. Minimalist Desk Organizers

Clutter can cause stress and hinder productivity. A clean and organized desk is key to staying focused. Consider minimalist desk organizers, which help you store pens, papers, and office tools neatly. Transparent organizers keep everything visible, so you don't waste time searching for supplies.

# 4. Smart Lighting

Good lighting is critical for reducing eye strain. Smart lighting solutions, like adjustable LED desk lamps, let you customize the brightness based on the time of day. They also add a sleek, modern touch to your workspace.

# 5. High-Quality Monitor or Laptop Stand

A quality monitor or laptop stand helps reduce neck strain by keeping your screen at eye level. Some stands also offer extra space to store items underneath, keeping your desk clutter-free.

# 6. Creative Wall Art

Personalize your office with creative wall art that inspires and adds character to your space. Consider framed motivational quotes, abstract paintings, or photography that makes you feel energized.

# 7. Plants for Your Office

Adding greenery to your workspace can have a positive impact on your mood and productivity. Plants not only improve air quality but also add life to your office. Opt for low-maintenance plants like succulents or snake plants that thrive in indoor environments.

# 8. Noise-Canceling Headphones

If you need to concentrate in a noisy environment, noise-canceling headphones are a game-changer. They help you tune out distractions and immerse yourself in work, whether you're taking calls or listening to calming music.

# 9. Personalized Office Decor

Adding personalized items like monogrammed notebooks, a unique coffee mug, or a favorite decorative piece can make your workspace feel more welcoming and tailored to your tastes.

# 10. Innovative Gadgets

Gadgets like a Bluetooth speaker, smart home assistants, or a digital whiteboard can add both functionality and fun to your office. These gadgets help streamline your workflow and enhance the overall vibe of your workspace.

I'm also an international student but i went to a college in the US, so language isn't really my problem. 

I think i made a small mistake by getting an apartment on my own while 80%+ of my cohort chose the graduate student housing. At first i tried to befriend some people, but the problem of they coming back to their apartments me going to another direction seemed to be a little annoying. 

I went to some of the grad students hangouts, both inse and outside of my department as the academy year began and made some people I'd call friends. I believe they will call me their friend too, but we're kind of more like casual acquaintances. We stop and chat for a little bit when we run into each other, but never that long. I talked to some of them who were also in the same class last semester and sometimes we'd go grab lunch or coffee after classes. But i think all of them kbow each other better than me and i felt left out sometimes. Also i was only invited to really big parties but usually not small hangouts. I know that because sometimes maybe two or three people i know would come to work together or cook dinner together or talked about something they did last night, etc. when i was also in the conversation. 

I hosted a house party and invited most of the people i know. They did show up and it was fun, but i felt like it doesn't help that much. 

I did ask some people about their plans for Thanksgiving and felt it seemed too desperate to ask again for the winter break. So i kinda just spend my time alone the two weeks of Christmas and new year. I thought about travelling but the fees and hotel rates are not really worth it if I'm just travelling alone. Currently i don't have anyone I'll text with here - my texts are usually with family and friends from the past. Btw, i did have a few old friends in the same state but they've all gradually moved away after last month. With the past two weeks i actually feel like isolated - it doesn't feel bad now but it could get worse, Plus my family is legit worried when i told them i didn't go out and do anything. 

I guess that's it. I thought about reaching out but honestly there hasn't been a good way to do it. I really don't have any team sports hobbies - for most team sports i do know how to play a little i suck too much to be in a game. I do go to the gym but it isn't a great place for making friends. I'm also working in a lab where im the only young grad student - the rest are post docs or 5th years or coadviced student(which means they don't show up a lot).

High-level ‚Äî she was nasty, rude, and disrespectful the entire time, which was surprising because prior to this we‚Äôve been quite amicable with each other. However, I guess she‚Äôs bitter about this and clearly lacks the maturity to remain neutral despite that. She was looking for excuses to come at me or attack me instead of just handling things like an adult. We got through it, but afterward, I called her out on her behavior by text because I see right through the BS games she‚Äôs playing. 

Her ‚Äúapology‚Äù? ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt my best performance‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not proud of how I acted‚Äù mixed in between deflection and justification. No ownership, no personal accountability.

1huugui,https://www.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/1huugui/a_guide_on_having_a_conversation_on_hinge/,A guide on having a conversation on Hinge,"A conversation guide has been requested in this sub for quite some time, so here is my take.

**Disclaimer**: This guide represents my personal opinion and is meant as a guideline, not a foolproof strategy. Other people may find success with their own approach, and you should seek an approach that works best for you.

# Getting a Date is the Ultimate Goal

The main purpose of a conversation on Hinge is to eventually set up a date. While not every conversation will lead to a date (someone says something that turns the other person off, or an incompatibility appears that can't be overcome, time-wasters), the most common issue I see is people chatting endlessly with no clear goal in mind. The end goal is simple: **a date.** That‚Äôs it.

# Mirroring

One important aspect to keep in mind when texting is mirroring. What is mirroring? Mirroring is adapting your texting style to match the person you‚Äôre talking to. For example, if someone writes long, multi-paragraph messages, or 3 or 4 rapid replies, it's okay to respond in kind. If you answer a long reply with one sentence, it can come across as uninterested or dismissive in what they had to say.

On the flip side, if someone only sends short sentences or one-word answers, responding with long paragraphs may seem overwhelming or try-hard.

If your match uses informal ""text speak"" (emojis, acronyms, abbreviations), it's fine to mirror that style in your responses. Texting back in a very formal style may make you appear unfriendly or frigid.

The point of mirroring is to build rapport with your match, making you seem engaged without coming off as either disinterested or overeager. But be careful not to overdo it either. You still want to be yourself. Once you understand your own conversational style, you'll find the right balance.

# Ask Open-Ended Questions

Ask questions that allow the other person to talk about whatever and keep the conversation flowing, instead of something that ends in a yes or no answer. (With the exception of asking someone out on a date, of course.) For example, if your match mentions liking movies, don‚Äôt ask, ""Did you watch the new movie this weekend?"" (which is a closed-ended question). Instead, ask, ""What did you think of that new movie? I heard great things about it!""

Also, be flexible. Let the conversation flow naturally. Don‚Äôt be stuck in a strict questions and answers format. It‚Äôs a conversation, not an interrogation.

# Avoid Interview Mode at All Costs

Following up on the previous point, one of the most common traps people fall into is ""Interview Mode,"" where one question follows another without any meaningful follow up on what the other person has said. While asking your match questions to develop rapport is important, you're not there to interview them as if you're looking to hire them for a job. A conversation should be natural, and interview mode tend to be mechanical and sounds more impersonal.

Here‚Äôs an example of Interview Mode:

* **You**: ""Where did you go during the summer?""
* **Match**: ""I went to Paris! I always wanted to see the Eiffel Tower in person! What about you?""
* **You**: ""I went to Cancun for my friend's wedding. Do you always travel in the summer?""
* **Match**: ""I try to. It's when work is least busy, so I always try to go somewhere.""
* **You**: ""Cool. What else do you like to do?""

An actual conversation should try to follow up on the answers and isn't just about moving onto the next question. Give a thoughtful answer and follow up on whatever they‚Äôve shared.

* **You**: ""Oh wow, I‚Äôd love to see the Eiffel Tower someday. The wedding was a blast, and I got to show off my dance skills, although I didn't get to see much of Cancun itself. Anyways, tell me more about Paris! What was the best part?""

A natural conversation should feel like a flow of shared experiences, not just a series of questions.

# Relate Your Own Experiences

Not every response needs to be a question. If your match shares something and didn't ask a follow-up question, you can reciprocate by sharing a similar experience. 

* **Match**: ""I went to Paris this summer! It was so beautiful""
* **You**: ""That sounds amazing! I visited Amsterdam last year and it was so amazing. I‚Äôd love to hear more about your time in Paris!""

This helps build rapport and keeps the conversation balanced, with the hopes of leading to a date. Remember,a conversation isn't an interview and it‚Äôs not all about just asking questions. Share a bit about yourself too.

# Be Fun and Tease (With Caution)

If they say something like, ""I love coffee from this cafe,"" you can say, ""The best coffee is actually at that place down the street‚Äîfight me üòÇ.""

However, there's a catch. Teasing takes skill, practice, and timing. Context is also important. If you‚Äôve built a rapport, teasing can be fun, but if you say it at the wrong moment or in the wrong tone, it could come across as rude or dismissive. You have to know when to be playful and tease, when to throw in a joke, and when to be sincere. Obviously, when your match is texting something serious, it‚Äôs not the appropriate moment to tease. 

Note: Teasing should never be insulting or mocking. Saying, ""Your choice of cafe sucks, their coffee is awful"" isn‚Äôt teasing, it's being negative and insulting. Teasing is supposed to be lighthearted and fun. You may be able to tease your long time friend with insults, but that's because a familiarity exists and boundary has already been set. It doesn't exist for a stranger.

# Strike When the Iron Is Hot

When the conversation is flowing well, and you‚Äôre connecting over similar interests or shared experiences, **ask them out**. ‚ÄúWould you like to meet up for drinks/coffee/ice cream and talk more about (whatever topic you both were discussing)?‚Äù Don‚Äôt wait too long and drag out a conversation past the natural end point and ask another question (Note: This is assuming you‚Äôre had at least a few solid exchanges or you‚Äôve been talking for a couple days minimum depending on the pace of response).

If they‚Äôre not ready, they‚Äôll likely let you know. They might say something like, ""I‚Äôd like to chat more first,"" or suggest a video or phone call instead. Alternatively, if they‚Äôre not interested, it‚Äôs better to know sooner rather than later. You‚Äôre on a dating app to find a date, not a pen pal. 

# Don‚Äôt Go Off-App Just to Chat More

Do I need to reiterate that the point of Hinge is to go on dates? Often too many of people fail to land a date is because even after building rapport, instead of asking their match to a date, they decide to ask them to go off-app in order to talk more. Stop wasting everyone's time by asking for their Instagram, number, Snapchat, or whatever in order to talk more. While you're busy trying to get their Instagram, someone else a lot smarter will be asking for a date and your messages will now be ignored.

Don‚Äôt waste time asking for social media contacts if you haven‚Äôt even set up a date yet. The best way to find out if someone is compatible is to date them. No amount of texting is going to compare versus just meeting someone in person, and more texting risks the chances of building up unrealistic expectations and ultimately disappointment when the real person doesn't match their texting personality.

# Have Patience

Just because someone takes longer to respond doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôve lost interest. People get busy, and sometimes they‚Äôre talking to multiple people at once. Sometimes people don‚Äôt check the app during weekends, or they may be preoccupied with something else at the moment and a dating app match isn't something they consider important.

Patience is key. Don‚Äôt panic if a match don‚Äôt respond quickly. 

# Double Texting Isn‚Äôt a Sin

We used to get so many ""should I double text?"" posts that we essentially stopped allowing them here. There is nothing inherently wrong with a double text if a conversation ran into a lull. Sometimes people will forget to respond, as you are just a stranger on a dating app and therefore lowest on the priority list in a lot of people's lives.  Double texting by itself isn't desperate or needy. You may thought of something on the previous text you sent that you forgot, and it's fine to text again. Or to clarify something to avoid a misunderstanding. Or the conversation essentially died out and you want to take a shot at re-engaging. 

What is desperate is texting multiple times in rapid succession because a match didn't answer back with things like ""did you get my text??"", ""why aren't you answering me??"", ""hello??"". That is needy, desperate, and unattractive.

Too many people follow these rigid rules of never double texting because they don't want to appear desperate or needy (who exactly is judging you anyways?), which ignores the context of the situation. If a conversation has genuinely died out and you want to reignite it, there is nothing wrong with double texting.

# Success Is Never Guaranteed

Sometimes, no matter what you do, the conversation just won‚Äôt go anywhere and you have to drop it and let it go. There will always be people on dating apps who are window shopping, seeking validation, or just messing around and not ready to date, or has no intentions to date. There will be boring people. Or they lose interest *through no fault of your own and beyond your control*. Does it suck? Sure, but that‚Äôs the challenge of online dating. You‚Äôre gonna run into some duds. But you can‚Äôt let that get you down.

Don‚Äôt dwell on it or think it‚Äôs all your fault. You can do no wrong and still come out on the losing end. The lesson is not letting it get to you, because people aren't doing it out to get you. You never know what's going on in someone else's life after all. Dating is still a numbers game and timing and luck both play a big part.

# There Is No One-Size-Fits-All Approach

Finally, remember that no one approach works for everyone. Just because something worked with one person doesn‚Äôt mean it will work with another person. People are not a monolith, and there's no magic formula for success.

This is something I have repeated here a lot, particularly with men who often think there is a secret trick to make every woman fall for them, if only they can figure out what that trick is. 

And what ends up happening is these guys act too formulaic and robotic because they think this is what a man has to do in order to be successful with women. But that's not how it works - **there are no guaranteed formulas, tricks, techniques, or blueprint that will make someone like/date/love/sleep** **with you**.

The best method is, and always has been, be your genuine self.

Not Soooo long ago, in a place not so far away.

My radio cracks up with my unit number: 

‚Äù2975 respond to an animal cruelty, 1234 Busy Ass St, at Save Everyone's Soul Baptist Church, dog abandoned in their trash can. No additional. 2975?""

2975, responding code 2.

I arrive and the entire church is empty. No cars in the parking lot. No signs of life at any building. The lights are off. It's dark. I think the holy spirit went down the street for a coffee. 

At the VERY back of the parking lot are two dumpsters. These are commercial dumpsters. Like 6 foot tall and 6 foot wide, probably 5 feet across. And there is an about 4 month old puppy in one of them. 

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? 

Someone has not only thrown a dog INTO THE TRASH, but they have used a dumpster at a CHURCH.

I'M SURE everyone has seen commercial trash collection trucks. Two big forks on the front of the truck that pick up a dumpster and fling the contents into the back of said truck.

The driver would never know that an animal was inside that large bin. Never know that animal was being crushed by the compactor inside their truck. 

I pulled the frightened dog out of that garbage dumpster and placed him in the back of my patrol unit. I promised that dog that he was safe now. 

I DID make contact with someone at the church who later explained that they had a SHIT-TON of cameras. All of them were pointed towards the front of the church.

If whoever did this had instead kicked in the front door of the church, or just broken a window, and thrown the dog into the front of the church, there would be video evidence. 

""So, there's NOTHING that records once you pass the main entrance?""

Nope.

And... Fuck my life.

Grace slumped her shoulders and let out a sigh as Damon, Desmond, Eloise, and Kai prepared to enter Wolfgang's private headquarters. The man was dead, but even the departed deserved some semblance of privacy.

""Thank you Grace, we'd knew you'd understand."" 

Although she was grieving her dearly departed, there was a murder that had to be solved. Given the circumstances of the crime, the entire school had to be searched from top to bottom. Of course, that included the dead person's dorm. Eloise delicately opened the ornate door, only to be greeted by the dank, musty smell of Wolfgang's pigsty of a room.

""Good god!"" exclaimed Damon, ""It stinks to high heaven in here!"" 

""Watch it soybean!"" growled Grace, ""Breathe wrong on the dead and I'll kick your ass!""

Rolling his eyes, Damon and the rest of the investigating crew entered the disorganized room. For a posh and well-spoken man, Wolfgang lived quite messily. There were clothes on the floor as far as the eye can see. From where they were standing, Damon can see a familiar woman's jacket and a man's white button up on the polished wooden floors. Empty, dirty coffee mugs littered the study table, evidence of both the messy personality and the caffeine addiction of the room's former occupant. 

""Where's an Ultimate Housekeeper when you need one?"" grumbled Damon, kicking a pair of slacks to the side. 

While everyone was diligently searching for evidence, a snicker suddenly erupted into a howl of laughter.

""Check it out!"" giggled Kai, ""Lawyer man wears sheep pattern undies!""

Almost immediately, everyone's heads whipped over to Kai holding a pair of purple briefs dotted with adorable cartoon sheeps.

""Well, theoretically, we can infer those briefs belonged to the owner of the room, mused Damon, ""However, given that no one has ever seen them on Wolfgang's person, there isn't a case beyond reasonable doubt that-""

""I'LL KILL YOU, YOU SOYBEAN!"" shrieked Grace as she pulled Kai up by the collar.

""EEK! I DON'T WANNA DIE!"" cried Kai.

While the chaos unfolded, Ingrid and Toshiko bursted in to see what was going on.

""What in the world is happening here!?"" yelled Ingrid. 

""Stay back,"" snarled Grace, ""There's about to be a second murder.""

""EEK! SAVE ME MOMMY!"" wailed Kai. 

As Ingrid worked to separate the two, a curious Toshiko rummaged through the half-opened drawers. Underneath the stash of crumpled shirts and sheep-themed undergarments was a simple black box full of envelopes signed with pink lip marks.

""Oh my~"" squealed Toshiko as she waved her fan in earnest, ""It wouldn't have been a surprise if Wolfgang wrote romantic letters, but I'm utterly shocked that an uncouth sow like you can even hold a pen!""

""HEY! THOSE ARE PRIVATE, YOU GREMLIN!"" roared Grace, dropping Kai to the floor to run after Toshiko, with Ingrid rushing closely behind.

As Grace's beligerant screaming reached a crescendo, more students begun to file into Wolfgang's bedroom to see what all the ruckus was about. Of course, some were distracted by more pressing matters, such as the surprising relevations into a dead man's private life.

""Wowza! Who knew Wolfie collected Pookeymon cards?"" exclaimed Jett.

""He even has the Pookachu from the Patawomeck River Museum collaboration,"" remarked Ulysses as he furiously scribbled some notes.

""SERIOUSLY!?"" fumed Cassidy, ""I camped in line for that card at the crack of dawn and they STILL ran out!"" 

""Hey Toshiko, what do you think of this?"" inquired Eva, who was holding up a copy of 50 Shades of Wool she procured from the nightstand. 

""Isn't that contraband?,"" muttered Eloise. 

""There's no school rules against owning that,"" replied Mark as he browsed the dead man's CDs. 

""Your compatibility with Mr. Wolfgang may be high, but your grammar is absolutely atrocious!"" yelled Toshiko who was now chasing Grace who was pursuing Eva. 

""I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU SOYBEANS!""

""Capitalist scum paying his way to the front of the line-""

""-These aren't even real silk! With my wealth, I can buy 100 pairs of these!""

""There's nothing but Kiddy Bops...""

""I haven't seen these since I went sailing in the Indian Ocean.""

""What kind of attorney doesn't even play Aces Tournament!?""

In a dark security room, two shrouded figures watched on as 15 students bickered amongst themselves.

""Perhaps we should just execute them all,"" muttered Tozu, shaking his head. !<",4,1736151362.0,ProjectEdensGarden,0,1.0,False
