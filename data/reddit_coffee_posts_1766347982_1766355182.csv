1psikhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/walkwith_metim/comments/1psikhv/vlogmas_day_20/,Vlogmas Day 20,"Wow. Wow. Lot of wows. She's a got decent view from the balcony, the same balcony and view Tim showed us in his video, but on a better camera. 

'I'm having a bit of a stolen moment, because I'm just going to get the coffees. So I'm going to take this private moment and look around the ship (while recording it on her phone) 

They have a coffee machine in the room, but Tim wants hot chocolate (real riveting stuff) 

They wanted to record something, but Tim was doing it, so she couldn't do it at the same time. This is the ice cube down your clothes thing they showed on Tims channel. 'It sounds like its naughty but its not!' 'its traditional!' 

'I haven't seen any snow yet' (apart from the snowy mountains she keeps saying wow about) cue 'Wow look at the snowy mountains!'

'I'm going to keep myself dry. If you really want to know why, it's because ive just washed my hair, and put a curl in it. If you're a lady, you'll understand.'

Oh no she changed her mind because she wants to keep recording, she's going to risk getting her hair wet. 

Another wow. Woooow. Wow. Wow. 

'it's a small ship, but thats nice cos its quite intimate' 

'Tim is shit out of luck cos they don't have hot chocolate' then a thrilling musing on whether the biscuits by the hot drinks are free. 

'I've given you some love heart biscuits so you feel ultra loved.' 'Tim looks mildly distressed and says 'you dont normally do nice thing like that!' 

'Isn't it nice us working together in the arctic circle' (working on what?)

shes so stressed from vlogmas! It's such hard work. We get a description of how long an upload took for the gift recommendations 

she said she couldn't have planned ahead and recorded the gift recommendations before the cruise because 'we're filming every day.' 

Her and Tim need to stop talking when you can't hear them due to background noise. 

She's looking forward to a day of no sunlight because its's 'going to be cosy and eerie' 

Tim is using AI to pass the time. 

'I need this type of service when I'm working. Thanks sexy pants' as Tim pours her more champagne. 'we've been here editing all afternoon' (does she edit her content? I couldn't tell since she rambles and her videos are bad)

we can't take the champagne with us cos we can't take it through security so we need to drink it. 

  
its not champagne its Prosecco. 

they're doing an 'old world' viking show, the same one Tim did on his video. 

she thinks it'll be like an old gladiators show she went to when she was a holiday rep in Gran Canaria

'we've seen snow on mountains, but not snowfall' 

'this water is really good quality' referring to the Norwegian Sea. 

I think she's literally showing the same thing Tim showed of the viking meal. Confirmed when you can see he's got his little camera out. 

Unlike Tim, who cut down what he showed, she is showing the whole thing. 

'Am I going crazy, or is that a penis on that statue?'

Her and Tim recording the same thing again. 

ended on a strange romantic song?

I would love to be friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

It doesn't matter what your age is or where you're from! Feel free to reach out if you'd like a best friend! :)",1,1766354928.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

1psigwg,https://i.redd.it/0h3kj5aorm8g1.jpeg,Hello world!,"Hi everyone. I am all new to this whole coffee / espresso game and I have recently treaded myself this nice Outin Christmas Set incl. the Mino, the Claro, the Stand and a nice Mill from a German company called Lambda Coffee (Modell: Terra Sigma, stainless steel, about 40 Steps). 
Needless to say my goal is to pull so really great espresso in the near future using the Mino as my only machine. At home I am the only one drinking coffee occasionally, but I nether have the room or the space a nice stationary portafilter machine. 
All of this said, as of right now, I am playing around with the Mino using 10g of coffee grounds, 60ml of water (hot, because it’s more convenient at home and dont drown the battery as quick) as at starting point. The last pull I made after lunch today, was about 30g at like 22/23 sec.
Since I am just starting to figure all of this out, I am not sure whether I need to tamper the grounds harder, grind the beans finer or add more water for a longer extraction time. I think my first goal should be and extraction time of about 30 sec. is that correct ? 

I would appreciate any advice, tricks or help regarding this whole topic. I know there is a million of YouTube videos and content on social media on how to pull decent espresso, but I prefer talking to other people and sharing ideas and experiences. So like I said I would greatly appreciate any advice, tricks or help regarding workflow and setup with the Outin Mino. 

Thank you in advance!
And greetings from Germany.

I did all the setup as described via the QR code including 2 of the test shots. Ended up making a cup of coffee and it tasted a little bitter/like it had coffee grinds in it. What do I need to do to adjust this?

I had the grinder set to 24 for the coffee setting. Trying to understand as this is the first time I’ve had a machine like this. 

Also is it normal for it to take 5-7 mins to brew a cup of coffee? Almost seemed like it brewed a little then takes a minute or 2 to heat up more water and brew more?

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

Women have made it very clear through their social media messaging and through societal norms that unknown men making conversation is unwanted.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 25-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1766354350.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

How's life been treating you? It was already snowy and somewhat cold where I live but I didn't mind, and I promise I am trying my best not to go for a Frozen reference here. BUT. In a very unlikely twist, the snow has almost entirely melted away, and in fact, yesterday it was RAINING! Right in time for the Christmas season, too! It's going to be so silly if Santa has to install a set of wheels on his sleigh... perhaps it's time I do the Heikki Lunta snow dance to remedy the weather?


Recently I've been feeling like I'm stuck in a bit of a social rut that even engaging the diff lock won't get me out of, as I'm doing mostly the same things every day without all that much variety. It wasn't always like this, and I really miss making new friends and being more social. I don't go out much at all due to everything but the stars in the sky being far away in the countryside - and both my online and IRL circles appear to be getting smaller and more distant. So, I figured why not give making a post like this a shot? What could possibly go wrong? (insert nervous laughter here....)


-

So, a little more about me - perhaps something piques your interest, or maybe there's something we can bond over!

 - I'm into a fair few things - some of which are all sorts of DIY, photography, some cooking (also known as ruining perfectly good meals with hot chili sauces...), pretending to be a detective of sorts, deal hunting and gardening. As for how the DIY has gone this year, I've been working on small farm machinery, a vintage table restoration project, adding in some blown insulation to the house, irrigation systems and doing some basic car maintenance for myself, but also for my dad. I like helping people whenever I feasibly can!

 - You can rarely find me playing video games nowadays as I made do with a woefully outdated PC for far too long. I did get an upgrade recently, but I'm very out of the loop regarding any recent games. I also have some older consoles, and even a 28"" CRT TV to pair them with! My favorite game of all time is Pocky & Rocky on the SNES. Some other titles I have fond memories of are Desperados, GTA: Vice City, Guild Wars, Gran Turismo, the Donkey Kong Country games also on the SNES... and judge me if you may, but I love the co-op in Resident Evils 5 and 6 =)

 - Music is something I consume a lot, though usually just as some background noise. Depending on my mood I usually alternate between trance, metal, rock, 80's hits and country - but I've also ended up liking video game OST's and Japanese city pop for whatever reason, and due to the ongoing season, I also find myself strongly gravitating towards Christmas music. I suppose I'm into quite a bit of variety!

 - I casually follow some sports as well, the most dear to me being biathlon, most forms of motorsports on four wheels, and snooker. Recently I've also taken an interest in football... and no, I'm not talking about the soccer kind. :p

 - If it matters to anyone - I sleep without a pillow, I'm much more of a cat person than a dog person (however, ducks rule them all...), I never kill spiders, I do my own hair, and I'm extremely good at making paper airplanes!

-

And, for the ones curious about the title, I bought a massive red coffee mug a while back - and I love it so much I recently got myself an extra so that I can dual wield =)

I have a couple of important pointers that you should probably go over before messaging:

-

I welcome people between the ages of 25 and 45 from all over the globe. However, kindly pay attention to any massive timezone differences, and understand that life can get busy sometimes - instant replies are not always guaranteed.

As stated in the title, I'm after longer term connections - putting in effort only to be ghosted within two weeks is never nice! If we clearly find no common ground, I will let you know! If we seem to click and get along, I don't mind eventually talking on other platforms as well.

I'm pro lgbt, and I'd prefer you having the same mindset as well!

I'm not into exchanging or sharing pictures of any sort right off the bat. We can exchange pictures later on if both of us are comfortable with it!

Don't be a liar, a creep, or an AI.

-

This post will remain open as long as it's not deleted. So, if you don't have the guts to say hi now, maybe you'll come at me later!

1psi9yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1psi9yo/we_abandoned_our_dream_project_and_it_mightve/,We abandoned our dream project and it might’ve saved our studio,"A little over two months ago, my partner and I made the hardest decision we’ve made since starting our studio.

We scrapped a game we had been working on for **two years**.

And the results have been terrifying.. and really exciting!

After years of development, multiple pivots, countless pitches, and a lot of coffee, we still didn’t have:

• A build we could reliably playtest  
• A clear scope we could finish within our resources  
• Funding to take it over the line

We tried to slice it down. It didn’t work. We couldn't find the angle.

So, with trembling hands and zero certainty we put a gun to the head of our darling, closed our eyes, and pulled the trigger.

After a night of tossing and turning, we decided to do this:

**We ran a 2 week game jam**

The goal was simple:  
*Could we design a much smaller game that we could realistically finish in 4-6 months?*

Starting from scratch with everything we’d learned over the past two years was… honestly blissful.

No legacy code.  
No old decisions we felt obligated to defend.  
Just clarity, fun and momentum from day one.

In those two weeks, we built the **entire core loop** of a new game as a UI-only prototype. It was ugly, but playable. More importantly: we could finally test it with players.

That prototype became **DarkBazaar** \- a small roguelike deckbuilder about managing risk, debt, and progression, where you play an underground weapons dealer operating through a dark-web marketplace.

We’ve now been working on it for \~3 months, and for the first time in a long while:

• Players are actually playing it  
• Feedback is shaping the design week by week  
• We’re iterating faster than we ever could before

Some early feedback hurt (progression felt weak, choices weren’t impactful enough, too much luck), but it gave us a concrete roadmap and in a single week we reworked progression, difficulty, and agency based directly on playtests.

Now players are playing our game for hours... that's a new feeling

**The biggest lessons for us:**

Killing a big project didn’t mean we failed.

It meant we stopped pretending scope would magically fix itself.

Making something smaller, testable, and finishable has completely changed how we think about:

• Validation  
• Iteration speed  
• Player involvement  
• Studio sustainability

It was the most difficult decision we have ever had to make since we started the studio but now, almost 3 months into it. I am starting to think this was the best decision we have ever made.

We have players, playing our game, we have publishers contacting us wanting to hear more, we are in talks with interested investors.

Of course this all depends on your particular situation, but I am just astonished at how right this feels and I would really encourage anyone who is struggling with at big project to just put it aside for a second and do a game jam. If nothing else, just for fun. Just to get a break from the big project and enjoy development again.

I am curious if anyone else has had a similar experience and also if anyone is frequently doing game jams either for fun or to come up with new games?

We have decided to make it a core part of how we work moving forward.

Anyways - hope this can maybe help or inspire someone",1,1766354295.0,gamedev,3,0.67,False

1psi9p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1psi9p4/14_short_dsh_perfumes_reviews/,14 Short DSH Perfumes Reviews,"During their Black Friday sale this year, I ordered 11 samples + 3 free samples from DSH Perfumes. 

First, I'd like to commend them for their customer service. In my order, I accidentally ordered 2 samples of Il Marinaio da Capri, and I sent them a support request via. their website form requesting to replace the 2nd sample with La Rose Béatifique. 6 days later, they sent me a sweetly written personalized email to confirm that they switched the sample;

""*Hi, [NAME]~

Thank you so much for your order and your email.  We apologize for getting quite behind in our replies with the Thanksgiving week, etc. 

It's no problem at all to switch out the extra il Marinaio da Capri for a La Rose Beatifique sample; Easy. :)

We hope that you will love everything~~~

All our best, 

Team DSH

ps: your order is shipping today!*""

Look at all those tildes! It's very cuteness. My package ended up mailing the day after I received the email, so 7 days (5 business days) after I placed the order, which is pretty good TAT during a Black Friday sale. This is the only order I have made with DSH so far, but in combination with never having seen anything negative about their customer service and their online store being around since (I believe...) the early 2010s, I do not expect anyone to have any service quality issues with this house. 

**About their website**: DSH has a pretty big catalog, with 343 total listings. Most of these are for singular perfumes, but a couple are larger collections of scents-- e.g. their One Off scent design labs and their archives. For the collections, you choose the scent format + size in the product options box and put the name of the scent you'd like in the comments box during checkout. Not a big hassle, but I found I had to make sure to mentally keep track of what I wanted when ordering. Also of note is that sample sizes for the scents are not always the same; Some are full samples, 1/2 size samples, 1/3 size, or smaller depending on the price of the scent. This is listed for every scent, so I would recommend checking if you would prefer to receive larger sample sizes. 

I had a difficult time writing helpful reviews for any of these scents, because I found that my experience of them was often fairly accurate to the descriptions that already exist on the website. For the scents that aren't in collection listings, they have both a shorter excerpt and a longer description tab that describe the scent and its creation. All the scents also have a Categories listing that act as a more common-to-indies notes/ingredients list. These are always hyperlinked to a shop page that include a short description of the note; I haven't seen any other shop do this and I found it super neat and helpful. For a random example... **Karo Karunde**: *An African flower note with fruity-floral qualities, and similarities to jasmine and stephanotis, with subtle plum-like nuances.* Much appreciated!

Now onto the reviews. Note that the ratings are just of my personal enjoyment, I think that all of the scents I received were well-crafted!:


**Snow Angels** (oil essence): *Hawthorn and crisp snowy air notes open the cool sparkle of Snow Angels.  Beneath lies a heart of white rice and mimosa, and a drydown of cozy cashmere musk and the subtle richness of sugar cookie dough.*

The snowy air note in this is really impressive! It really just does smell ""cold,"" I don't get any menthol or other distracting notes from it. On a different point, I have to stop ordering perfumes with floral notes and expecting them to not be prominently floral LOL. I honestly got this just for the sugar cookie note, but this goes primarily crisp, white florals on me. The cashmere and sugar cookie dough sit at the base to add some fluffy texture and sweetness. There is also the slightest bit of that freshly-cooked starchy rice airiness. 2.5/5


**Orion** (EdP): *A soft, warm and cozy ‘kitten’ fur skin scent fragrance; an entrance animalic perfume for those who are curious but not ready to dive into the ‘deep end’ of the funk.*

Ahh... There's a ""Honey Musk"" note listed for this, and that comes out very strongly for me, enough to prevent me from naming this as a realistic cat fur fragrance (cats do smell just slightly sweet, but its very subtle!). I think I get lots of nutty ambrette seed from this, though I'm not 100% familiar with the note, mixed with fuzzy and lactonic undertones. 2/5


**Coffee Absolute** (VdP): *A pure and simple dark roast coffee scent.*

Pros: Yes! This is a realistic, plain dark coffee scent. No complaints on this front.
Cons: The longevity sucks LOL. I don't think it even lasted 2 hours on my skin. I expected this since it's a single note coffee with no other base notes, and the VdP format is likely contributing to this as well. If I were to full-size this, I would get the solid perfume or body lotion format. 3/5


**Foxy** (EdP): *A smart, sexy, and playful retro-nouveau animalic fragrance that features the fur accord paired with a spiced – boozy beginning, and a rich, ambery drydown.*

Interesting! Definitely animalic, but wearably so-- I don't find that it contains any fecal undertones. I have trouble describing this one because it comes out very well-blended-- Like the description says it is boozy, ambery, slightly spiced and fruity. Less ""apple cider"" and more ""warm rum and whiskey."" Hex code #AB4E11. 3.5/5


**Ambergris no.10 Accord** (oil essence; from Archives: no.4 : The Accords): *a classical ‘true’ ambergris accord; smooth, warm, and ever so slightly salty.*

This is the first time I am trying ambergris on its own, and this is also the perfume I am wearing as I write these reviews :]. Right upon application, it's smooth and clean, like an ambery cologne. As it dries down, it becomes warmer and nuttier, with more of a cedar texture. Feels very easy to wear. 3.5/5


**Zeitgeist 55** (EdP): *The fragrance of a black leather motorcycle jacket, riding leathers and dry, elegant suede.*

Dark, clean, sharp leather! I get a small amount of floral elements too; like a oudy floral attar (there is no oud in the notes but that's what it reminds me of). I think this could come off a bit harsh for people who aren't into leather, but I quite enjoy the novelty of it :]. 3.5/5


**Il Marinaio da Capri** (EdP): *Il Marinaio da Capri is an interesting mash up of styles resulting in a crisp, green, honeysuckle chypre with subtle aquatic nuances (salty sea air without the calone / musk combo so often used for marine scents).*

Very nice! This one feels almost atmospheric; Standing on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea with the scent of distant honeysuckle bushes wafting in (does honeysuckle grow in the mediterranean...?). The sea air feels satisfying and idealized; possibly a middle ground for those who want a more realistic aquatic without going into full funky territory. I found that this one had good sillage and longevity as well. 4/5


**Hot Masala** (EdP): *Hot Masala or “hot mix” is made of warming, grounding spices with a big dose of indolic Indian Jasmine & Indian attars, lush resins, and a golden milk accord.*

One of my favorites from the order; the description is very true. The golden milk/masala spices are realistic and the most prominent part of the scent: warm, comforting, lactonic and sweet, not too harsh. As it dries down, the jasmine and attars come out more. The jasmine is indeed indolic; I very much enjoy this but YMMV. The attars are woody, earthy, a bit sharp, and help to add some atmosphere to the scent. 4.5/5


**Châtaignes du Bois** (VdP): *A rich and cozy-warm melange of woods mixed with the tempting aroma of roasted, sweetened chestnuts.*

Another one of my favorites. Warm, smoky woods with burnt sugar are what I get most prominently, similar vibe to Olympic Orchid's **Woodcut**. The chestnuts are there to prop it up and add some nutty and sweeter elements. Not as gourmand as I expected, but still very comforting. 4.5/5


**Au Crépuscule de Lavande** (VdP): *A candied fougere retro nouveau perfume:  sweet and delicious lavender mixed with dense, golden, resinous immortelle, myrrh, and tonka bean.  The aldehydes and blackberry top notes make this unlike the aromatherapy lavender versions we are all so familiar with.*

The aldehyde and blackberry opening reminds me of flavored sparking water, and fades quickly. The lavender is quiet and soft, and it is equally sharing the stage with immortelle and coumaric tonka bean. I wish I got more lavender from this one; I think the more herbal ""aromatherapy"" style of lavender is actually what I prefer. Not unpleasant, just not what I was looking for. I think I might enjoy this one more with future wear. 3/5


**The Art of Letting Go** (EdP): *A soft and comfort-filled matcha latte perfume with subtle fruity – citrus notes in the top note, creamy gourmand notes in the base, and a lovely osmanthus – green tea heart.*

I'm gonna begin this review to state that this is not suitable for anyone who is looking for a pure matcha latte type scent. The matcha is there, adding grassy fluffiness in the background, but I do not find it to be the most prominent element. The opening is stone-fruity, and the dry down is surprisingly creamy and buttery-- I think the osmanthus contributes to this but I'm not too familiar with it. Buttery, grassy, and earthy. I don't happen to jive too much with this one but I think that's just a matter of personal taste. 2/5


**Butterfly Nectar** (EdP, from Archives: no.9): *A lovely lemon-clover-honey fruity floral with lush hints of animalics and woods in the drydown. The perfect evocation of Summer.  Only flowers could produce this sensual and provocatively honeyed elixir sipped on summer afternoons by butterflies.*

This one is beautiful! Opens with lemony-honey, the honey not being too animalic or syrupy, backed by airy, soft, pollen-y florals. Slight bit of white peach as well. Definitely spring tea-party type vibes, it's natural feeling and lacks any harshness. 4.5/5


**Black Death Cherry** (EdP): *Black Death Cherry is a bright, sweet, slightly boozy, dark red fruit cherry focal fragrance with edges of embery smoke, charred wood, and burnt sugars.*

The cherry in this goes all wrong on me; it's meant to be a maraschino cherry accord but it just feels cough-syrupy sadly. Under the cherry, there's smoky wood and burnt sugars similar to in Châtaignes du Bois that makes it more tolerable. I've actually never liked maraschino cherries, and as I sniff it more I think it is realistic to how they taste, so maybe someone who likes them more would enjoy it. 2/5


**La Rose Béatifique** (EdP): *The most resplendent of pink roses… all sweetness, filled with fruity happiness and lovely violet / iris nuances.  The drydown reveals a surprisingly meditative feeling with frankincense and myrrh as anchors.*

The rose here is dewy and fresh, slightly sweet, and then the dry down reveals the incense which gives the scent a more grounded feel. I can't say much on this scent that the description doesn't, but I found it pleasant. 3/5

Looking for a Plus-One for Cozy Winter Days,"It’s been too long since I’ve had the kind of night where conversation flows, laughter feels easy, and you walk home with that warm, fuzzy feeling. Let’s Have a Genuinely Good Time

We could grab coffee at a quiet bar, wander through a museum, stay up too late talking about the strange corners of life… or just chill in home with blankets, Netflix, and a little bit of stolen warmth.  

If the chemistry is there, maybe it turns into something more, slow, natural, unforced. I’m not shy about wanting intimacy, but I think the journey to it is just as fun as the destination.  

### *About me*

- 26, fit, clean, 6’0"", 65 kg, beard & glasses (non-native)  
- Friends would say I've a calm voice, empathetic, alternating between hopeless romantic to romantic rebellion. 
- Uni, work, gym, repeat, but making time for what actually matters  
- Rarely smoke, 420-friendly, overall pretty chill & open-minded. 

### What I’m hoping for

A genuine, easygoing connection with someone who’s open-minded and kind. You take care of yourself, and feel comfortable expressing what you want without pressure or games. I prefer starting meeting in person after talking for awhile, seeing how the energy feels, and letting things develop naturally if the chemistry is there.

**Age range** 

– I care more about chemistry than numbers; attraction doesn’t follow a strict age rule (18+). 
 
**My promise** 

– just two people meeting with good intentions. No expectations, no awkwardness, no obligations. Comfort and mutual respect come first.

Anyways If you’re in the mood for a connection that can be coffee, cuddles, or something a little more electric…  
then maybe we should meet like two old friends who just haven’t met yet :)

So my (I think emotionally abusive) husband keeps calling me OCD and I try to explain why I don’t think I am but he’s adamant. 

I will say he doesn’t like being ‘told what to do’ and ‘just wants to do what HE wants to do’ and not clean. I’m

Now re OCD i just go by what I’ve read - generally but not limited to: checking things, having to have labels lined up etc, being very scrupulously clean, feeling as though if you were to not do x then y would happen (please correct me if I’m wrong and I empathise fully 💔). I don’t have any of those issues or worries (and bless those who do)

I don’t have any of those symptoms/issues. 

I can leave things messy or dirty but I know that it’ll need done at some stage and easier to deal with xyz as I go rather than a big problem or when someone comes to the door and feeling embarrassed. 

An example: we went for a coffee where he did something to upset me. As a result I got quiet/shrunk myself. At the end when he finished his cake I stacked his plate onto mine. He sniped at me that I didn’t work there (I was really just keeping my hands busy, plus I’ve worked in hospitality)

Later, he was chopping stuff in the kitchen. I walked past to take some of my rubbish to the outside bin (big bulky bit of cardboard). On my way past I saw he had two tied up food bags (our food gets bagged in special bags and recycled) and was working on a third. So since I had a hand free and was going to the place where rubbish goes I lifted them and took them out. No comment, no thought that something bad would happen, just there’s food waste needing taken to the bin where I’m going

He’s furious and says added to the plate thing I’ve absolutely got OCD. 

I say I haven’t.

The manager was screaming at this young East Asian worker telling her verbatim “You can’t leave, I am your manager you work until 1”. The only reason this really bothered me is I recently watched a video about how Tim Hortons has been accused of abusing temporary foreign worker program to save money/abuse workers. This upset me because I’ve been there many times and quite enjoy the morning staff including the manager. I know sometimes things can get frustrating at work especially during this time of year if you’re short on staff. But given the context that these employers have so much control over certain workers it just gave me a bad feeling. Anyone have experience with that location?

I just wanted to talk about this, if people don't mind? 

I'm in my 40s, married, diagnosed about a year ago and I'm taking Vyvanse and afternoon coffee. 

A lot of the time I feel like I'm just going though the motions, living life on autopilot. Doing things and acting a certain way because it's what is expected.

I definitely feel negative emotions. I can feel them intensely and I can enjoy a challenge/feel like I'm doing well. Ie; I'm currently learning to ride a motorcycle and did a group ride yesterday as the least experienced member. I'm clearly getting the ""good job"" dopamine reward.

I can feel for people, video games and media. I can feel a hint of being happy for people in them. I feel pleasure and contentment post intimacy. I barely smile.

I don't think ever really feel joy or extreme positive emotions, though. 

I watch my partner light up at small dogs - while I remain a blank canvas. I don't think I'm depressed, as I'm functioning properly. All of this existed before Vyvanse and is probably slightly better with. 

Is this just dopamine dysregulation? Am I just sad? Bored with life?

I’m hoping to put together a small, casual coffee group (4–6 people max) focused on thoughtful, judgement-free conversation rather than small talk.

Details (flexible):

• Adults of all ages

• Morning to lunchtime meetups

• Once or twice a week, depending on interest

• Coffee shop or other relaxed, chat-friendly space

The group would be sex-positive and kink-positive in the sense of being non-judgemental and inclusive. Discussion of sex or kink is not a requirement, but it also wouldn’t be considered off-limits if it came up naturally in conversation.

This would likely suit introverts, people feeling a bit lonely or left out, or anyone who enjoys respectful, open-minded conversation in a small group setting.

And boy are they much much more worth than a coffee.

Not this isn't the first time I've been captivated by a cheap IEM, I love my kiwi ears belle and kbear kb01 for doing quite the same thing to me a couple of months ago.

But the kuntun is literally 10x cheaper than both of those (for me, and you if you use coins) and comes close and overtakes both in departments. These 3 sound so god damn close to each other, it took me a whole while to figure out where each stood out.

The kuntun just has no offenses for me, it has the low rumble I'm looking for, voices sound completely natural and the highs are crisp. I'd say that between the kiwi ears and kbear, the kuntun sounds the most natural.

The kiwi ears has more low end by default, and the sound is a bit more analytical. The kbear shines with vocals, a warm and seductive mid range. But the kunten manages to almost give a much more hollistic/cohesive experience, which isn't straight up better, but something that is instantly enjoyable, for anyone.

The kunten doesn't offend, that is the true magic of it, it doesn't stray from what would please everyone. This might be a let down for some, but for pure put in and tune out, I swear there is nothing better than the kunten.

Price regardless, these are some of the most plesant and relaxing experiences I've had in a pair of iems.

Now the place where I can feel distinct differences are the soundstage. The kiwi ears have more width, and the kbear kb01 have more verticality.

The kuntun falls short of both the width and verticality of the above, but it has both of those to a sufficient extent, where the presentation is intimiate yet with enough space for imaging in both horizontal and vertical planes, with a little of extension into the z plane as well.

The kbear kb01 still does sound more musical (be it my definition of musical) and the kiwi ears sound more analytical and has more bass (would be better for a bass head), but for an overall performer? I'd pick the kunten.

I also have a kz castor pro and a vader pro, the kunten very easily beats both in presentation. I would not recommend the castor/castor pro to anyone when the GK kunten is available, and at such a cheap price.

If anyone is on the fence of buying one of these, I would recommend picking one up if you have aliexpress coins saved up, it's such a no brainer to have these as a back up or even a disposable at the price  at which you can find them at, because by god are these amazing.",4,1766353684.0,iems,1,0.83,False

Google the symptoms of low serotonin, I had them all while I was sick. And that there was this chemical he had found did well in research but was impossible to find, so he asked chat gpt and it said that’s in hydrolyzed whey protein. And that he started feeling better within a few days of taking a half dose or so twice a day. 

So I got some fruity pebble flavored hydrolyzed protein and did about the same or maybe a whole serving twice a day. And it really helped. I think the tryptophan and leucine and other stuff in there does a lot, but also just to be able to get some considerable protein and nutrients down in a half a coffee cup of what tastes like fruity pebble milk was also probably key because eating is so hard. 

Just wanted to put that out there. The hydrolyzed stuff isn’t like normal protein powder it’s more broken down and the amount you have to drink is way less",2,1766353654.0,Mononucleosis,0,1.0,False

How does this work? Why is it even a thing? Surely you should be allowed to apply to as many as you want? Surely you should be able to have as many coffee chats and interviews with as many as you can? 

Would it be a different system for internationals? Would they get priority for ranking the banks which sponsor first? 

I've heard many banks try and have a diverse intake from across the top schools so instead of hiring only from one school, they'll hire a few from Wharton, a few from Columbia, a few from NYU etc. So if you're at a school which is known for IB would you be at a disadvantage since you'll be competing with more of your peers/cohort? 

So would going to Stanford for IB technically be better than going to Wharton for IB even though Wharton is a finance school simply because no one else at Stanford would be recruiting IB and you'll have comparatively much better odds? ",0,1766353562.0,MBA,0,0.5,False

Just a few points though:

1. I can’t understand why people act like when they order less delivery should cost less. I just scratch my head when I see people bitch about their 13 dollar Taco Bell order becoming 25 with tip. Like no shit? I don’t expect more pay when it’s a higher order unless it’s a stupid order like 15 pizzas or I shop. Why do customers expect to pay less?

2. The mark ups seem to be a misconception. Yes, dd takes a fee. Yes, restaurants markup items to cover that. However, in my original case I think the person said their six dollars over coffee turned to nine dollars. Thats the restaurant gouging…dd doesn’t charge a 50% mark up.

3. If you order larger amounts you might pay less than at a sit down place. If I order 85 dollars of Applebees I’ll tip like 17 dollars which is right around 20% in restaurant. If I get that delivered and I’m two miles away I might only tip 6 dollars, because again the work is the same.

Ultimately, I have a hard time understanding why people freak out about an $11 food order becoming $23 once you added tips and fees and how people seem to think that that order should only cost five dollars to be delivered since the base price is low. 

The work to get it there is essentially the same as if you order $100 worth of food.",2,1766353407.0,doordash,3,0.75,False

1pshwfr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pshwfr,[Acne] Skincare help!,"Need skincare help!

I’m looking for some help with figuring out what is wrong with my skin and what to do about it. As someone with a facial structure that I don’t love on the best of days, having red skin and breakouts on top of that leads to my self confidence being at an all time low. 

My skin on my face is kind of just red all over, and the worst places for me are the areas around my mouth where if you look closely there seem to be a ton of tiny little bumps. The pores on my cheeks are huge and I occasionally just wake up with one of those deep swollen pimples brewing in a random location that acne patches do nothing for. My forehead is usually the most problem free area but of course today it is broken out as well. 

I drink nothing but water and the occasional coffee, my diet isn’t perfect but it’s pretty healthy overall and I’m vegetarian so I eat a lot of whole foods. I don’t touch my face during the day and sleep on silk pillow cases which I wash often. 

Products I have and have used in different combinations:

\\- Cerave foaming cleanser for normal to oily skin: I’ve been washing my face with this in the mornings daily for probably 2 years and it only seems to dry out my skin if anything 

\\- Cerave SA cleanser: I bought this recently and have been using it at night because Chat GPT told me to but haven’t seen any improvement 

\\- The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%: on days when I don’t use the retinol, I cleanse and then wipe the toner over my face with a cotton pad and then wait for it to dry and then apply the niacinamide. 

\\- The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner: paired with above

\\- Cerave moisturizing cream: this is the only moisturizer I’ve ever used that prevents my skin from being visibly dry and flaky so I use it every night and have been for years

\\-Cerave resurfacing retinol serum: I use this a few times a week after cleansing and then apply the moisturizer, on days where I don’t use the ordinary products

\\- Hero acne stickers: these work well for pimples that have actually come to a head but never helps with the deep ones 

\\- Head and Shoulders Dry Scalp Care shampoo: I’ve even tried washing my face with this recently because I’ve seen some people on here saying some stubborn acne can be fungal but haven’t seen any change with that either 

I just feel like I’ve tried so many different angles and have been making no progress. Admittedly I haven’t solidified one single routine and stuck with it for months at a time, but it’s also because I feel totally lost and worried I may be doing the wrong things. 

I’m 28F and live in Canada, seeing a dermatologist isn’t in the cards for me rn for several reasons, so I’m just hoping anyone who may have similar skin to mine can even point me in the right direction? I’m so green when it comes to skincare and beauty in general but I’m so tired of feeling so down about myself. Literally any and all suggestions welcome.

The box opens.
Light—too bright, too loud—pours in, and the air smells wrong. Not pond-warm. Not mud-soft. It smells like wires, dust, and humans who talk too much.
I freeze.
Big shapes loom overhead. Their voices thump through the floor like distant thunder. One laughs. Another adjusts something that hums like an angry cicada.
I hop.
Bad idea.
The ground vibrates. A chair scrapes. A foot comes down right where I was. I leap again, heart drumming, slick skin cold with fear. I vanish beneath a desk that smells like old coffee and panic.
This place has no sky.
I wait. Frogs are good at waiting.
The voices keep going—stories about monsters, woods, things that should not be named. I do not know these things, but my bones tell me the air is thick with them. Every word makes the shadows longer.
I explore when the thunder-voices fade.
There is a forest here, made of cords. Vines that hum softly. A warm cave that glows red when I touch it. I sit there for a while, soaking in the heat, pretending it is a sun.
Suddenly—BOOM.
Laughter. Loud. Close.
I jump straight up, smack into something soft, and slide down a wall that yells.
“THE FROG.”
Yes. That is me.
Chaos erupts. Chairs move. Humans panic. One tries to catch me with a box like a clumsy heron. I zig. I zag. I am speed. I am fear. I am a legend now.
I end up behind a curtain, breathing hard.
This studio is dangerous. But it is also warm. And full of bugs drawn to bright lights.
I wait again.
Eventually, they will find me. Or they won’t.
Either way, when they tell this story later, they will say the frog disappeared.
But I know the truth.
I was never lost.

Seconds of stunning and piercing silence passed. Through the broken windows I heard footsteps cautiously approaching. I finally unlocked the deadbolt and flung the door open. It slammed against the wall as I charged the Amazon delivery driver outside. 

“Holy shit!” The driver yelled as he jumped off of our porch.  

I froze - hunched over, panting, and covered in glass wearing tangy boxers.

“Man, get the fuck back.” The driver reached into his pocket and pulled out a can of pepper spray. 

I blinked, trying to catch my breath as adrenaline still poured through me. I leaned over and grabbed my knees desperately gasping. I opened my eyes to see a massive pool of blood forming at my feet, its source a fountain from my shoulder. “Oh god” I whimpered between staccato breaths. “Oh god. Oh god.” The world around me felt fuzzy as I struggled to stay standing. Through a tunnel I could hear the driver asking if I was alright. I saw his feet inching closer, less hesitant than before. My legs gave out from under me and I fell backwards. “Oh god. Oh god. Oh god.” I heard through the distant ocean in my ears. I could barely make out screaming from behind me before everything went black.

“Tell the doctor to stop giving him sleepy medicine. He'll wake up.”

“Oh honey, I really wish it worked like that.”

“...maybe if you give him coffee he’ll wake up?”

“Heh, I’ll ask the doctor if he can do that...”

“Matty! Oh baby I haven't heard from you in two days. Is everything okay?”

“...no…”

“Wha- Why not? What’s going on, baby?”

“We're in the hospital right now…someone broke into our home…”

The stale whooshing of fluorescence was a surge on my ears, and beeping broke my sleep. My throat was raw and I just wanted quiet.

“Honey?” A familiar lull slowly brought me back to the light. “It’s Matthew. Can you hear me?” My siren was calling for me. The air I breathed gushed in my chest as a fragile smile grew on my face.

“Mhuuu…” Was all I could muster. Then warmth intertwined my hand. A sigh trailed from my lips.

“Hey honey.” He breathed enchantingly. Never had I felt bliss more than when he was in my presence. He was home. “Hold on, don’t go back to sleep.” He lightly joked. I let out a muddled chuckle. “No, I wanna see your pretty eyes. Wake up for me.”

I floated through his allured hum, his caressing hand as my serenity. I knew true peace around him. 

I wandered here and there in the sway of lucidity, not caring where I was as long as he was there with me. A gentile swaying crested my woozy body as his words muddled into a soft echo in my mind. It coasted me through rolling coming upon my body.

But faster and faster the rocking came, quickly jolting me back to reality. I fought with my eyes but after valiant strain they fluttered open, and I could see the world. 

The world was watching me back with a wary grin. Matthew stopped shaking me and asking me to stay awake. 

He weaved his fingers into my hair, every delicate stroke bringing me farther away from delirium. 

He whispered to me that I was in the hospital. I was near broken windows. I had surgery. I was filled to the brim with pain meds. None of that mattered. My love had me in his precious hands, making sure I was taken care of. 

Since I had woken people had been coming and going, checking my vitals, asking me all sorts of nonsense, wanting to know if I hurt anywhere. A few cops came in and tried to ‘jog my memory about what happened’. I told them what my Matthew told me. They didn't like that. After they left, I pleaded with Matthew to let me rest my head in his lap while he massaged my psyche. He gave in and sat cross-legged on my pillow. He couldn’t say no to my poor, battered self.

A while later another person came in and handed me two cups. One pills, and the other water with the good ice. “I don’t need drugs” I whined to them. Matthew shot gentle daggers down at me and I knew he was going to win whatever argument I tried. So I swallowed my pride with the opioids and wandered back into my dreary, wading lullaby.

“How are you feeling?” He eventually mused.

“I’m fine.” I breathed. The pain was lapping at my shoulder and chest, but it was a distant ache. Tolerable when I'm resting on him. 

“Sterling called a few times when you were asleep. He really misses you.” His thumb soothed my temple. 

A drugged gasp filled my lungs. “Where is he?” I couldn't remember the last time I'd seen him.

Matthew stopped me from sitting up. “He’s ok. He's with your sister. She met us at the hospital after the ambulance got you.”

“I wanna see my baby.” I slurred through pitiful moans.

“It’s too late for visitors, but he’s been waiting for a call from you all night.”

I looked above me and he was already on his phone. It rang only twice before my panicked sister answered “Is he awake?” She stumbled over her rushed words. 

“Rina?” I tired sitting up again but Matthew held me firm. “It’s me, where's Sterling at?”

“Oh, thank god.” She nearly cried out. She composed herself quickly before calling out to my son. “He was playing with my kids, but he's coming right now.”

“Is he ok?” I couldn't help but ask.

“Yeah, he's shaken up a bit, but he's fine.” The line began to buzz as I heard his bouncing chitter in the background. “Here you go Ster, daddy wants to say hi.”

“Sterling? It’s daddy.” I nearly cooed to the phone. The line was quiet for a second

“*...dssss-iss-ms-ssssssss…*” static played over every word my son spoke. “...*is-as-asss-rssss-hssss-pssssss-wsss-tssssss-ass-ssssss…”*

“Hold on honey,” I interrupted. “The phone’s being weird”. Matthew looked down at me and his face was a mask of itself. 

“*...ws-wsss-pssssss-mssssssss-os-tss-hssssss-dssss…”*

“What?”

“*...wsss…”*

Matthew finally chimed in. “Is…is the phone on speaker? Can you give it back to Aunt Rina for a second?”

“*...dssss…”*  

He delicately stole the phone from my hands, took it off speaker and struggled to get my sister back.

I wondered about the interference, maybe there was a line down or a storm was coming through. Glancing up, I saw the persistent glow Matthew always exuded faltered with something I couldn't quite understand. He lightly argued with my sister before hanging up and grabbing the hospital’s landline.

“We’re gonna try to see if this'll work better for you.” We sat as he quickly dialed her number. “Ok, let's try this again.” He confirmed he could hear my sister well and asked if Sterling could speak a little more clearly before passing the line to me. I held it weakly up to my ear hoping that it was just something wrong with his phone.

“Sterling?”

“*...****SKEEEEEEEE-***” 

I flinched so hard the phone flew out of my hand as my ear rang in pain.

Matthew grimaced in a way that made me uneasy. “We’ll call tomorrow.” He said slowly as he fished the phone back by its cord. 

I immediately protested but he held my head and shushed me. “You’re on some strong pain meds. I bet it’s getting hard to hold a conversation, plus I was even struggling to hear what you were saying.” He comforted. He gracefully lifted my head and slid off the hospital bed. “I don’t know about you, but I'm exhausted.”

“Then let's go home.” 

“Honey,” he hushed. “Its almost eleven. We can’t leave tonight, but the doctor told me that if you're improving and stable tomorrow, you can be discharged.”

“But…But what about Sterling?”

“He’s spending the night with Rina. I made sure he's gonna be fine. I promise.” He left a warm kiss on my forehead. 

“But…” He wouldn't let me argue.

“It’s ok. Sterling is safe. I took care of everything else. All I need is for you to rest.” He looked down at me and batted his eyelashes. “Can you do that for me?” He put on his wide doe eyes.

I knew he was trying to guilt me into staying in bed. But I could never say no to him when he pouted. It was frustrating sometimes when he cared too much about my well being. 

“Fine.” I grumbled back. Defeated but enjoying the forehead kisses I got in return. 

We pressed the nurse button to get some more pillows and blankets and they came in with the stiffest, hot blankets and one inch thick pillows. I complained about the accommodation but Matthew shooed them away with a confirmation that I was grumpy from the meds and pain. I huffed but I knew he was right. I was exhausted. 

We had a one sided conversation as I slowly fell back asleep to the sound of his siren song.

I'm currently residing in Kentucky, which is known to have some of highest rates of both animal abuse and child abuse across the entire nation. My parents are currently living in pest infested squalor, both with significant mental issues that make it impossible for them to make sound decisions or care for themselves. 

It's a literal fucking wonder how the house hasn't gone up in flames since my mother is expected to handle literal fire (kerosene heater and grill) with glaucoma, brain damage resulting in falls, and possible dementia. My father has returned to being an alcoholic after struggling pretty severely with ""high functioning"" autism while sober and now he's gotten even worse in regards to his attitude.

They genuinely need to be the nursing home for their own safety (as sad as it sounds), but absolutely nobody gives a fuck. I'm literally expected to sit there and watch them slowly kill themselves. However, I'm the one that's stuck at one since everybody wants to accuse me of being a spoiled brat for wanting food to eat and a clean place to live.

The lack of proper nutrition is causing me to develop significant nerological issues that impact my daily life and make it too difficult to exercise like my family wants me to. I've gotten to the point where I struggle significantly with balance, fine motor function, and cognitive thinking. I drop my phone almost constantly, can barely type without error (nearly every word is autocorrected), and often end up deleting important things by accident while simply trying to browse my internet history. 

I've honestly stopped drawing because I can't hold up a pencil anymore (everyone was already getting too hateful about me doodling anyway). I can't walk normally without my feet getting tangled together causing me to fall, so I have to walk with my head down and feet pointed outwards (duck foot) the whole time. I have very little to no sense of object permeance at all, so I'm constantly losing track of every little thing even when the room is completely spotless. I spend every nearly waking minute of my life spinning around in circles in my room at the nursing home until I stumble upon whatever I'm looking for.

I desperately need to see a specialist ASAP, but absolutely nobody gives a fuck since my bloodwork is ""fine"" (all anyone does is gossip about their kids the whole time). Plus, I'd more than likely have to travel out of state since it's an extremely rural area with next to nothing but grass for hours. Most of the places we drive through don't even have a Dollar General.

I have nobody else to stay with because my older sibling (who is my legal guardian) dumps me right back at our parents hoarder after two days tops, regardless of what I do. They never invited me to their kids like they said they would. I ask if I can come over only for them to say they're busy nearly 24/7. The only damn thing that I can really get out of my sibling without issue is bullshit like Starbucks coffee and that's it.

We don't have any shelters or anything for miles where I live, so I'm at a complete loss of what to do anymore or how to save myself from dying this way.",11,1766352218.0,AutismInWomen,5,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------
LATEST MESSAGE FROM BROKER:
Before we move forward, I wanted to share a quick overview of what we’re seeing in the current rate environment. This way, you’ll have some market context to help make the right decision for your family.

Market Snapshot:
Rate outlook: Markets are largely expecting no changes to the Bank of Canada rate through most of 2026. As of mid-December, there’s only a 3% chance priced in for a hike at the January 28th meeting.

Inflation: 
November’s CPI came in at 2.2 (just under expectations), with core inflation easing to 2.8. The Bank’s tone has become more measured as a result.

Grocery prices remain a pressure point (fresh fruit, beef (+17.7), and coffee (+27.8) are up sharply) While shelter costs rose only 1.7, the slowest pace in almost a decade.

Forward Rate Trends:
Fixed mortgage spreads are tight (meaning there's not a ton of wiggle room if any at all for rate exceptions), and special-offer 5-year fixed rates haven’t moved in over six months (something we haven’t seen since 2018).

As of today, markets show no clear directional conviction (but not even one full rate hike is priced in for 2026). 

Trade Risk on the Radar:
A new factor: CUSMA renegotiations. With Canada’s effective tariff rate to the U.S. currently just 6 (thanks to CUSMA), any changes post-2026 could impact business sentiment, especially in Ontario’s housing market. The Bank of Canada is watching this closely, and it could influence their path on rates.

TD's offering:
5-yr variable: 3.99
5-yr fixed: 4.30
4-yr fixed: 4.30
3-yr fixed: 4.10

Their variable rate is right in line with market benchmarks. The 5-year fixed is ~6 bps above market, while the 3-year fixed at 4.10% looks especially competitive right now.

Our recent simulations show that the 5-year fixed still edges out in terms of projected interest cost over time, with the 3-year fixed close behind. Of course, the best choice depends on more than just rate forecasts.

Key Considerations:
Rate stability vs. flexibility: With the BoC signaling that rates are ""about right,"" fixed-rate premiums may not offer much upside, unless your priority is long-term certainty (which is a huge priority for many Canadians)

Trade risk: 
CUSMA renegotiations could introduce economic volatility (more clarity expected in 2026).

Your plans: 
Term selection should align with your risk tolerance, cash flow, and how long you plan to stay in the home.

Market positioning: 
TD’s rates are competitive, especially on the 3- and 5-year fixed terms.

Next Steps:
My current variable rate of 3.95 is nearly identical to TD’s 3.99, so not much difference there.

TD’s fixed rates are more competitive than what I have access to today sadly:
5-yr fixed: TD at 4.30 vs. mine at 4.39
3-yr fixed: TD at 4.10 vs. mine at 4.14

Still happy to talk through your options. I’ll also keep monitoring rates and will let you know if anything changes before your renewal.",0,1766352201.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,6,0.5,False

As silky as this may sound, I was thinking why not roll the dice and go for a virtual date with someone from the wild world of Reddit haha. It’s a win-win guaranteed! I mean, we both gonna have a laugh no matter what! So what do you say? As long as you don’t try to call the date tonight while I’m tipsy lol. 

At any rate, I’d love to hear from you and we can chat a while if you wanna and get to know each other… 

I love pistachios ice cream, blue berry pancakes and fresh brewed Italian coffee! The beach any day of the year and probably because I love the water and getting more tanned lol. I can never say no to a good book/read, good food, and fine dining. Yeah! What can I say, I’m a food enthusiast haha. 

Going into this with no expectations whatsoever so hit me up and share some holiday cheers! I don’t mind your age as long as legal to drink of course 😆 but i do prefer someone more mature, mentally, emotionally and all.

1psh9y9,https://i.redd.it/rfesk521im8g1.png,"Stuttering John Podcast Summary from December 21, 2025. Superchats: $210","This episode features host Stuttering John (referred to as ""the Duke"") broadcasting from a friend's house in New York after traveling. The show runs approximately 2 hours, blending personal updates, fantasy football commentary, rants about online rivals in the ""Dabbleverse"" community, responses to live chat, and political tangents. John appears hungover or low-energy, frequently sipping coffee, checking football scores, and waiting for his mother to return with his wallet and car. The tone is defensive and rambling, with John repeatedly calling out ""cowards and liars"" while boasting about his integrity. The chat is overwhelmingly hostile and trolling, with users mocking John's appearance, lifestyle, and legal issues (e.g., references to arrest warrants). Superchats total $211.41 from 76 messages, averaging $2.78, often used to bait or insult him. The mood is chaotic and adversarial, with emojis, ""L"" (for loss), and calls for police intervention dominating.

The summary is broken into rough chronological topics based on the transcription, with timestamps for reference where possible.

# 1. Introduction and Personal Update (0:31 - ~9:00)

John greets viewers, confirms he's back in New York at a ""friend's house"" (later revealed as family-related), mentions traveling with wet clothes, grabbing pizza, and watching football with his brother. He discusses his low-energy state (""Randy coffee, man"") and monitors fantasy football player Drake London's status (""I am monitoring the health of Drake London... It says he's starting, but they have not said for sure""). He casually dismisses past harassment attempts like food deliveries. 

**Unusual/Stupid Highlight:** John's fixation on minor details like wet clothes and pizza feels oddly mundane for a podcast opener, and he bizarrely calls the Gulf of Mexico the ""Gulf of America"" in a later tangent, prompting chat mockery.

**Chat Mood:** Trolling and hostile, with users mocking his appearance, location, and potential arrest. Many reference him hiding at ""mom's house"" and call for police. Superchats start trickling in with jabs.

**Best Chat Comments (5-10):**

* @office75-ys8nx: ""I really wish you were arrested :disappointed\_face:""
* @Oldcraig1209: "":man\_police\_officer::oncoming\_police\_car::man\_police\_officer::oncoming\_police\_car::man\_police\_officer::oncoming\_police\_car::man\_police\_officer::oncoming\_police\_car: get ready""
* @Dizzzzz5 (superchat, $2.00): ""Ur at mom's house same mirrors and ceiling fans""
* @jeffny9: ""arrest incoming""
* @AB\_223: ""Hiding out at Mommy’s LOL SAD""
* @vinnieheadache: ""NICE TATTOO, MARY""
* @chrisplusplus (superchat, $2.00): ""Google Maps shows that Gulf of Mexico doesnt exist""
* @office75-ys8nx: ""You made your 87 year old mom pick you up you liar""

# 2. Fantasy Football Picks and Game Monitoring (~9:00 - ~24:00)

John quickly makes NFL picks for the day (e.g., ""Bills against the Browns. Chargers against the Cowboys... I'll take the Browns and the Chargers"") and ties it to his fantasy league standings (""I am only 46 percent chance of winning""). He checks scores intermittently throughout the show, complaining about players like Tony Pollard (""Tony Pollard, man, get it together, what the fuck are you doing?""). 

**Unusual/Stupid Highlight:** John's ""tiebreaker"" guess of ""44 and a half"" is arbitrary and unexplained, and he admits to rolling the dice on lineups, highlighting his casual, unprepared approach despite calling it a ""chore.""

**Chat Mood:** Bored and sarcastic, with users mocking his football knowledge and energy. Comments shift to personal attacks on his health, shirt, and resume.

**Best Chat Comments:**

* @jaywarren333: ""The Gulf of America""
* @vinnieheadache: ""FANTASY SPORTS IS FOR LOSERS WITH NO REAL LIFE""
* @Tommybhoyb1967: ""Stop talking about fantasy football its boring""
* @handyrandy7420: ""VERY GAY SHIRT""

* @stonestom (superchat, $1.99): ""How come no New York for Christmas? Legal matters?""
* @MichaelGavinAli (superchat, $5.00): ""What are your thoughts on Howard Stern signing a 3 year deal with Sirius XM? Are you and Stern politically a line against Trump.""
* @TemporaryName80: ""looking more and more like the puppet with every hangover duke. skol""

# 3. Rant on ""Cowards and Liars"" – Focus on OJ (The Orange) (~24:00 - ~1:00:00)

The core topic: John accuses ""the Orange"" (OJ) of betraying him after a friendly meetup, reading private texts where OJ promised to limit ""sniping"" (online mockery) to three times a week but reneged (""You gave me your word... I guess it isn't""). He plays clips from OJ's stream, calling him a ""coward"" and ""pussy boy"" for being friendly in person but hostile online (""When he's around me, he's a big pussy boy. But when he's in his fucking shithole in Ohio, he big tough guy now""). John boasts about his integrity (""My word is my bond"") and plans to confront rivals at ""Hackamania"" in Vegas. 

**Unusual/Stupid Highlight:** John's dramatic reading of texts and repeated ""pussy boy"" chants come off as unhinged; he claims an ""incredible fucking memory"" while forgetting details, and bizarrely ties it to anti-Semitic conspiracies about an ""elephant salute.""

**Chat Mood:** Supportive of trolling John, with users celebrating OJ's ""turn"" and mocking John's victim narrative. Superchats bait him about OJ and legal issues.

**Best Chat Comments:**

* @jaywarren333: ""John, would u be in the same locker room as Navid?""
* @TemporaryName80: ""you turned on OJ first""
* @Jonnynocksville (superchat, $2.00): ""Your LOLSUIT is going to bankrupt you SKOL""

* @JoeMidnightSpookShow (superchat, $2.00): ""SK:potato:L! The entire Net loves OJ more than a friend""
* @jimmythedrunk\_452 (superchat, $4.99): ""John, OJ is a fan. He wanted to meet you and had a great time in your presence. I’ll be at Hack-a-mania to have SJ’s back. Skol:double\_exclamation\_mark:""
* @dirtydeeds-nc9st (superchat, $2.00): ""OJ is a womangerine #SKOL""
* @KF\_Sage (superchat, $5.00): ""Can we get another elephant salute?! hell yeah brother o/""

# 4. Political Tangents and Community Beefs (~1:00:00 - ~1:30:00)

John shifts to politics, criticizing Trump as an ""alleged pedophile"" linked to Epstein (""He definitely was hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein at Epstein Island""). He defends Howard Stern's Sirius deal and aligns against Trump. He rants about other rivals like ""Shitway,"" ""Lardiff,"" ""Tookie,"" and ""Clearwater Chad,"" playing clips and accusing them of manipulation. 

**Unusual/Stupid Highlight:** John's conspiracy-laden Epstein rant includes unverified claims about Susan Wiles and Brett Ratner; he performs a bizarre ""Soul Patch Silent Mike"" song parody (""Doo-doo-wop, downtown doo-wop"") as a non-sequitur.

**Chat Mood:** Mocking and political baiting, with users challenging his facts and appearance. Superchats focus on his ""toes"" and Hackamania threats.

**Best Chat Comments:**

* @Chilino67 (superchat, $5.00): ""measure the space between your top lip and your nose for me you freak of nature""
* @APRalph (superchat, $2.79): ""Yo! stuttering John do You Remember The 90s?""

* @fanciful\_promenade (superchat, $2.00): ""Do Spud&Roco remind u of theAxis of Evil from WW2?""

* @WaHappa-z4q (superchat, $4.99): ""Next time u look out da window,hope 5 knucles comes thru…SKOAL!""

# 5. Responding to Superchats and Personal Frustrations (~1:30:00 - ~1:50:00)

John reads superchats, defends his finances (""Why should I give them my money? They already take 30%""), and agrees to show his toes for $50 (though it doesn't happen). He complains about forgetting his wallet and needing a dump (""I gotta take a dump, she's better... opiate shits + roids = a bloody Xmas"" – from chat, but he echoes). He plays a clip about Chad's ""turn"" on him. 

**Unusual/Stupid Highlight:** John's toe negotiation (""Five toes, $10 a toe, cool"") is absurd and desperate; he calls his mom live on air (""Hey, mom, mom, mom, are you almost done?""), exposing his dependency at 60.

**Chat Mood:** Increasingly chaotic and mocking his helplessness, with arrest and family jabs. Superchats spike with personal insults.

**Best Chat Comments:**

* @SPPR221 (superchat, $4.99): ""John will u show the camera your tows for a 50 I’ll send""
* @islaroyale8284 (superchat, $4.99): ""You’re built like an alcoholic. Loss of muscle tone, Loss of loved ones, refusal to face facts. I’lll waiit""
* @Tim-422 (superchat, $2.00): ""You Lied about Hackamania last year. never came""
* @chrisplusplus (superchat, $2.00): ""My bro is a bounty hunter in NY. Wanna meet him?""
* @Avas\_a\_tranny\_mann (superchat, $4.99): ""What’s with the elephant nazi salute? Are you saluting the Führer on Christmas?""
* @KF\_Sage (superchat, $5.00): ""Can we get another elephant salute?! hell yeah brother o/""
* @beavisleeray7305 (superchat, $5.00): ""imagine being 60 and still forgetting your wallet for a convenient excuse to leach off others :face\_with\_tears\_of\_joy: Giants are LLLLLLLLLLLLOSING L OSER""
* @MrDoodle257 (superchat, $5.00): ""You have no monies on your debit card lol. You have all apple devices and no apple pay? Liar!""

# 6. Wrapping Up and Final Rants (~1:50:00 - End)

John complains about his phone dying, fantasy losses, and ends abruptly to ""take a dump"" and watch football (""This is Stuttering John saying, gigeeya""). He reiterates Hackamania plans and teases more confrontations. 

**Unusual/Stupid Highlight:** Ending mid-rant about bowel issues (""John's gotta take a :chocolate\_bar: COVERED :cherries::pile\_of\_poo:!!!!"" – from chat) feels unprofessional; he dismisses the show as a ""chore"" despite begging for superchats.

**Chat Mood:** Triumphant trolling as the show ends, with holiday mockery and ""L"" spam. Final superchats poke at his loneliness.

**Best Chat Comments:**

* @PoolScamSam (superchat, $1.99): ""Skip. My mom has my wallet too. I feel ya""
* @chrisplusplus (superchat, $2.00): ""hey 140 IQ: get the extra key then Uber to the car""

1psh9xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/1psh9xa/coffee_shops_are_businesses_not_libraries_buying/,"Coffee Shops Are Businesses, Not Libraries; Buying One Coffee Doesn’t Entitle You to Camp for Hours","This might be an unpopular take, but here it goes.

Independently owned coffee shops are not public study halls. They’re small businesses operating on thin margins, paying rent, utilities, staff wages, insurance, and constantly fighting to stay afloat. When someone buys a single $5 latte and then occupies a table for four hours, that math just doesn’t work.

A coffee shop seat is revenue-generating real estate. If you’re sitting there all afternoon, that table can’t turn over. That means fewer customers served, fewer tips for baristas, and less income for the owner. Multiply that behavior by a few laptops in the corner and suddenly half the shop is functionally closed for business.

What makes it worse is the sense of entitlement. “I bought something, so I can stay as long as I want.” That logic wouldn’t fly anywhere else. You don’t buy a single beer at a bar and claim the table for the entire night. You don’t order an appetizer at a restaurant and set up camp for the afternoon. Yet somehow coffee shops have become the default free coworking space.

And this isn’t just about the business. It’s also unfair to other patrons. People who actually want to grab a coffee and sit for 20–30 minutes often can’t find a seat because someone is running a full remote workday off one drink.

There’s nothing wrong with studying or working in a café. That’s part of the culture, and many owners welcome it. But there’s a difference between being a customer and being a squatter. If you’re going to stay for hours, keep buying drinks or food. Tip well. Be mindful. Or go somewhere designed for that purpose, like a library or a coworking space.

Coffee shops survive on volume and turnover, not goodwill alone. Supporting local businesses means understanding how they actually make money, not just enjoying the vibes.

Buy another coffee. Order a snack. Or make room for the next person.",51,1766351685.0,providence,71,0.62,False

She asked to get off the app we met on, so we went on snap, which I haven't used in years. We talked and talked, then I woke up 3 days later to find she deleted me. It happens, so I didn't give it much thought. I get an add on snapchat again from the same girl. Her account supposedly got ""locked"" and she felt bad that it seemed she had ghosted me, so she watched this past year's college commencement at my school to see if I was in it(I graduated in 2020 from grad school at that school) to find my last name to get in contact with me. She wound up finding my snap username from the app, so she just used that. I was already weirded the fuck out, but I kinda wanted to see what would ensue. We kept talking, and she went on a tyraid about how she self-sabotages herself in terms of sexual partners, that she has so many options, but always finds a problem with them. Earlier today I get this PHD thesis message about a ""product"" overview for her as a person, which was clearly written by chat gpt. I asked what this was for, she told me ""someone who wanted a booty call asked me to give them an overview of who I am.""

I proceeded to ask her if she wanted to meet up, and she acted surprised when I said that because I wasn't interested in being a pen pal. She was nice about it at least, but the whole thing was just weird as fuck and I wanted to share.

“Where the Coffee is Black and the Dawn is Blazing.”

To the Esteemed Keepers of Law in Folsom,

Infernal greetings.

As the moon wanes and the shadows lengthen, we of the \*\*Greater Folsom Satanic Fellowship (GFSF) have observed that certain officers of the Folsom Police Department have been granted access to a \*\*private, locked, religiously provided break room\*\* hosted by a local faith organization.

In the spirit of \*equal spiritual accommodation\*, we would like to extend a similar offer.

Our Fellowship is pleased to propose the creation of a \*\*Satanic Police Break Room\*\*, fully compliant with the highest infernal standards of comfort and reflection. The room would feature dark-roast coffee, ergonomic seating, tasteful red accent lighting, and a discreet horned bust for contemplative purposes. Gregorian chants would be replaced with ambient doom jazz at a respectful volume.

Participation would, of course, be \*\*entirely voluntary\*\*. No oaths, invocations, or ritual sacrifices would be required — though the option to symbolically renounce dogma while enjoying a donut would remain available.

We wish to emphasize that this offer is made not out of malice, but out of \*\*fairness\*\*. If public servants may enjoy privately funded religious spaces during working hours, it seems only just that \*all\* belief systems — including those that celebrate reason, autonomy, and the occasional goat-themed novelty mug — be afforded the same opportunity.

Should the City of Folsom prefer not to manage multiple faith-based break rooms for its police force, we would fully understand if it instead chose the simpler solution: \*\*none at all\*\*.

We await your decision with cloven hooves crossed.

Warmest regards,

\*\*High Infernal Preceptor Malachi Ember\*\*

Happy holidays to everyone.

(FYI I'm ordering them how they appear in the pictures, in rows from left to right)

**Ormonde Jayne**

• *Babylonia* - Sweet, powdery, fruity and floral in the air. This is extremely well blended, I can't pick out the notes clearly. This is a completely feminine scent, but a great one nonetheless. 8/10

• *Champaca* - A soft and sweet floral scent. Where Babylonia smells full bodied and for a mature and decisive woman, this smells light and young if I could put it into words. Very musky and also green up close, it's a great light floral-green scent. Also feminine. 8/10

• *Damask* - A beautiful rose scent in the air with a touch of fruitiness. Also quite musky and slightly green up close, but the rose scent in the sillage is gorgeous. Might be unisex leaning a bit feminine. 8.5/10
 
• *Evernia* - Immediately got hit by a Santal 33-like scent, but less pungent and more ""round"". Quite spicy up close, this is pretty peppery. It has a medicinal spicy undertone I don't like, and even less so combined with this Santal 33-like smell. Not a fan. 4/10

• *Frangipani* - Sweet florals with a touch of citruses and a smidge of vanilla. This smells familiar and nostalgic, my grandmother had a fragrance that smelled similar to this. Quite musky up close, very well blended like all fragrances so far. 8/10

• *Isfarkand* - This is very light in the air and on paper, the muskiness is very predominant but it's slightly citrusy and woody. It smells clean, very effortless and could be an easy daily wear. I'd like to see what this one is like on skin. 8/10

• *Levant* - Very orangey, it almost smells like you turned a mandarin orange soda we have here in Mexico into a fragrance, but without being syrupy or synthetic. Musky and with a noticeable orange blossom up close. Might be unisex leaning slightly feminine just like Damask. 8/10

• *Osmanthus* - A very interesting floral and tangy scent, this smells amazing in the air. The pomelo note is excellent, and it's blended particularly nicely with the osmanthus. I think this is unisex and I'm looking forward to trying it out. 8.5/10

• *Qi Intensivo* - Very strong tea note in the air paired with some osmanthus. Quite musky up close, it smells clean and very likeable but it starts getting a cheesey undertone as it dries so I'll have to try on skin. 7.5/10

• *Sakura* - A beautiful powdery and sweet scent in the air. Up close it's pretty green, musky and a bit citrusy but the powdery scent in the air took me by surprise. Very nice. 8/10

• *Ta'if* - Ambery rose scent in the air, it reminds me of Memo Paris's Abu Dhabi but with rose and without spices. Up close it's white florals forward. Quite nice, leans a bit more unisex than feminine leaning. 8/10

• *Verano* - Very citrusy and tea-forward but with a slight earthy undertone. It smells familiar, and I think it's because my gym used to use an air freshener that smelled similar to this. Up close it's a bit powdery and woody, and it shares some mild similarities with both Qi Intensivo and Evernia. This one I'm also looking forward to trying a lot. 8/10

• *Ambre Royal* - Musky and slightly floral in the air. Very ambery (obviously) and woody up close, some osmanthus and a touch of iris. Pretty nice. 8/10

• *Arabesque* - Gorgeous rose oud scent in the air. A bit floral and fruity up close, blended nicely with the rose and oud. 8.5/10

• *Byzance* - Soft, floral and a bit fruity in the air. Definitely a bit lactonic up close and it also has an almost minty greenness, I'm assuming from the cassis. It's an interesting scent, but it's pretty nice. 8/10

• *Montabaco Intensivo* - Very similar to Verano, it has that same citrusy and green smell accompanied by that recognizable airy/ozonic smell. Unlike Verano this doesn't smell powdery up close and I think I prefer this slightly over Verano because of that. This also reminds me of my gym to be honest, but not in a bad way. 8.5/10

• *Muscat* - Very similar to Oud For Greatness, but this isn't overdosed with whatever metallic and sharp musk that has. Up close this has a soft floral and vanillic smell, and it smells great with the fresh spicy ""oud"" from the OFG/Haltane DNA. Looking forward to trying this out more. 8.5/10

• *Nawab of Oudh Intensivo* - I see why this is the most used sample from both sets (I bought them second hand). It's a gorgeous blend of rose with citruses and spices in the air, quite musky, fresh and clean. Not particularly oudy at all but maybe it'll come out on skin, even if it doesn't have much. 8.5/10

• *Ormonde Man* - Soft and green cedar smell in the air, slightly peppery. Up close it's a bit fruity but the musky, peppery cedar are more prominent. Kind of in a similar vein to Isfarkand. 8/10

• *Ormonde Woman* - More floral and powdery in the air compared to Ormonde Man, but they do kind of resemble each other. This might be unisex more than feminine leaning and, at least off first impressions, I like this better than Ormonde Man. 8/10

• *Tolu* - As expected, quite balsamic in the air but soft and a bit sweet. Up close this smells pretty green and with a touch of orange blossom. It's a bit sharp, I feel it in my throat when I smell it. Not bad but not for me. 7/10

• *Vanille des Afriques Intensivo* - Not that vanillic in the air, there's a more prominent iris and soft spices, this gives me mild Delphinus vibes. The iris stands out a lot more up close, but the combination of the florals, the almost buttery iris and the soft spices give off a medicinal/syrupy smell. 7.5/10

• *Xi'an* - Pretty interesting scent. It's musky and woody, and the rhubarb gives it an unusual sweet, green fruitiness that's very interesting. It's slightly peppery up close, but it's the perfect amount of pepper. Looking forward to trying this out more. 8.5/10

My biggest takeaways from Ormonde Jayne is that they're all very natural smelling fragrances, nothing synthetic or unnatural about them except for the mild cheesey undertone some of them started developing as they dried. For mostly feminine fragrances you should get the ""Atmospheric • Fruity • Floral"" discovery set, the ""Amberesque • Spicy • Woody"" are all more unisex or masculine leaning.

**Orto Parisi**

• *Bergamask* - Not a fan of this. The bergamot is sweet but slightly bitter at the same time, but more importantly, the musks in this smell very body odor like, and it doesn't help this is as ridiculously potent as it is. It's a lot softer and more pleasant on paper, but I had a bad experience with this on my skin when I decanted a sample onto an atomizer. 5/10

• *Boccanera* - A very interesting and well done mix of sweet and spicy notes. It smells mostly like a peppery chocolate but in a great way. It does remind me of Black Afgano (which I'll talk about later) but it's much better in my opinion. 8/10

• *Brutus* - Loads of chocolatey patchouli in the air blended incredibly well with lavender and some citruses. It's almost powdery up close, but very nice overall, it's almost like you turned Pardon into a fougère. 8/10

• *Cuoium* - Spicy and animalic but it smells way, way better than when I tried it in store on my birthday. It's incensey up close and I do get a slight burnt tire-esque smell from it, but it's much more palatable than it was when I first tried it. Will have to see what it's like on skin. 7.5/10

• *Megamare* - Slightly floral and aquatic on first instance, it still surprises me how clean Megamare smells in the early opening. I know this has calone so I probably won't like it on skin but it is quite nice on paper at first. 8/10

• *Risvelium* - Herbal grapefruit and musks in the air. This still smells pretty vegetable to my nose, almost like the taste of beet roots with a grapefruit zing. 8/10

• *Seminalis* - Still somewhat reminds me of Pardon but in a gourmand way, this has a lactonic and chestnutty finish to it. I still think Seminalis is one of the most wearable Orto Parisis. 8.5/10

• *Stercus* - Powdery almond scent in the air, almost baby wipes-esque. It has a cherry-like smell up close and it's oudy in a smooth way. Very likeable and wearable overall, I'll have to see what it's like on skin. 8/10

• *Terroni* - Very dry birch, a touch of charred incense and a nice fruitiness, but it's not quite raspberry like people say. I get an almost animalic/cumin-like smell from this up close. I'm quite intrigued, I'm looking forward to wearing this. 8/10

• *Viride* - Very green and aromatic, reminds me a lot of Absinth (more on that later) but with a Beau de Jour-esque fougère finish to it. This is incredibly nice, definitely my favorite Orto Parisi on paper. 9/10

**Maison Crivelli Cuir Infrarouge** - This is indeed in a similar vein to Oud Maracujá, but vanillic and much more approachable in general. In the air I get the raspberry, a bit of leather and vanilla, all very well blended. Up close it's floral and woodier. I'm confident people who didn't like Oud Maracujá will probably like this more instead. Looking forward to wearing this. 9/10

**Frederic Malle**

• *Dawn* - This is very weak on paper, I can barely smell it. I get a slightly oudy and ambery rose but it also has a clean, almost airy finish, kind of what I expected Roja's Amber Aoud to smell like. Smells nice, I'll have to try it on skin. 8/10

• *The Moon* - Much stronger than Dawn, I immediately smelled jammy berries in the air. On my fingers I get a smidge of a smokey and barnyardy oud and berries, very well balanced and well blended, on paper this smells like berry syrup. I like it a lot more on skin than on paper. 8.5/10

• *The Night* - Strong animalic oud supported by rose, it's like the opposite of Dawn (which makes sense based on the names I guess). Very well blended and the ""funk"" isn't too powerful, so it's not too distasteful. Obviously not a beginner oud scent neither in price nor scent. 8/10

All three fragrances smell great but they're obscenely overpriced, even at discounter prices. I'd still like to get a sample of Hope to try it as well. 

**Amouage**

• *Fate Man* - Smells clean, green and a bit spicy but it's very weak on paper. Up close it's also a bit floral. I'll have to try this on skin, I wouldn't like to think Scent Split waters down their decants of discontinued fragrances. 8/10

• *Figment Man* - I got a faint smell of wet soil in the air, not quite petrichor. Up close this is damp and earthy, definitely in a wet soil kind of way. I get a slight floral note peeking from behind this earthiness and it smells great, as well as some dry vetiver. Pretty interesting but maybe not something I would wear. 7/10

• *Lyric Man* - Smells almost like pure musk in the air, only a tiny hint of rose. Up close this is still very musky, rose with a touch of lime. It smells very clean, borderline soapy but I can't help but find this slightly feminine leaning. I prefer deeper and darker rose scents but this isn't bad by any means, just not my preference for a rose scent. I'd have believed anyone if they told me this was an MFK fragrance. 7.5/10

• *Opus I* - Sweet, spicy and floral in the air, almost like honeyed white florals. A lot of tuberose and ylang-ylang up close but not sharp at all, as well as some woods and fruitiness. This is pretty unisex in my opinion. 8/10

• *Opus II* - Green and fresh in the air, a bit fougère-like. A great blend of wormwood, lavender and cardamom with a bit of pepper. Smells great too. 8/10

• *Opus III* - Smells like syrup in the air. Up close it's powdery in an almost dusty way, the violet is predominant along with other white florals. Something about it reminds me of the Alexandrias from Xerjoff, maybe the dusty powderiness. This one is on the feminine side. 7.5/10

• *Opus IV* - Spicy and aromatic in the air in a scented candle-like way. Very spicy up close, this is like a subdued and more palatable version of Reckless Leather (Opus VII). Also a bit floral and with a bubblegummy sweetness. I'll have to try this on skin. 7.5/10

• *Opus VI* - Green, almost camphorous in the air. This is pretty sweet and ambery up close, it makes me think of Interlude Man. I like this one a lot too. 8/10

• *Opus VIII* - White florals with a green touch in the air. Very prominent jasmine and orange blossom, a bit of ylang-ylang. Clean, inoffensive and unisex, very nice. 8/10

• *Opus IX* - Jasmine with a bit of honey. It doesn't smell animalic on paper, which tracks as animalic notes tend to not show at all on paper. The honeyed jasmine smells great though. 8/10

• *Opus X* - Smells like varnish in the air, but not as harsh as rɛal varnish. Up close it's very metallic, it smells like paint but it's blended well with the rose and a bit of geranium. In some ways it reminds me of Bvlgari's Sahare, that one also smells very metallic (to my nose) as it dries. Very interesting scent, and I'd say it's pretty wearable. 8/10

• *Opus XI* - Oudy scent in the air, but oddly it smells like mushrooms too. Up close it's a smokey leathery oud with a green, almost vegetable smell. Very dry but it should be a more palatable oud scent than Silver Oud and King Blue to most people (I like both of them a lot myself). I'm not sure I like the green aspect of this scent. 6/10

It's a shame to see many of these fragrances were discontinued, especially Fate Man and Opus II. It doesn't come off as a surprise that other fragrances like Figment Man and Opus XI were discontinued, though, but not necessarily because they're bad fragrances. I do notice a mild shift between these discontinued fragrances and the ones Amouage currently sells, these being a bit less mass appealing and more creative scents, especially Opus X. I'm glad I could try them all.

**Ex Nihilo Citizen X** - Clean but slightly peppery iris in the air, it smells barbershoppy. Up close it smells so clean it borders on soapy but it's very well done. It almost smells aquatic too, not sure why. 8/10

**Tom Ford Oud Fleur** - Smells much more tame than I expected, it smells like rose and sandalwood, very clean. I had heard this is a bit animalic so I'm hoping that aspect comes out on skin but as it is I like it. The patchouli and some mild spices stand out more as it dries on paper. 8/10

**Nasomatto**

• *Absinth* - I was hoping this didn't smell like the usual absinthe note from other fragrances like Viking or Myrrhe Mystère and thankfully it doesn't, this smells green and aromatic, with the aniseed smell being subdued to the point where it's tolerable during the opening. I'll have to try this on skin to see if it stays that way. 7/10

• *Black Afgano* - This smells almost like nothing on paper, just a nice sweet scent with a touch of coffee. I'm confused. It smells like something I wore or tried recently but I don't remember what. It smells nutty as it dries, but not in a nice way. No score.

• *Blamage* - Musky and woody, quite inoffensive to be honest. A bit green and leathery up close but not as in your face as I thought it would be. I kinda see this as a molecule fragrance to be honest. It does smell good, though. 7.5/10

• *Duro* - A very well done spicy, woody scent. My preconception of Nasomatto as a brand has me expecting these to be weird or somewhat offensive scents but I'm finding that they're actually very approachable and easy to wear. 8/10

• *Nudiflorum* - Fruity and leathery, a bit green. Once again, very well done and I think this is quite likeable for a leather scent. I'll have to try this on skin, it starts smelling nutty/petroleum-like as it dries. 8/10

• *Sadonaso* - An almost gourmand vanilla and coffee on paper, a bit musky. The vanilla note in here smells exactly like the one in Tom Ford's Eau d'Ombré Leather. I'm assuming this gets pretty animalic on skin so I'll have to try it but this is very nice. It smells like vanilla ice cream as it dries. 8/10

• *Silver Musk* - A simple clean, airy, almost icy sharp musk. I bet this is great for layering. I like this much more than other molecule fragrances I've tried like Another 13. Surprisingly this turns a bit leathery as it dries. No score.

In the end I feel a bit disappointed by these Nasomattos, not because they're bad fragrances, not in the slightest, but because I expected them to be more exotic scents I suppose, something odd like Fantomas. I passed on Narcotic Venus because I don't like tuberose scents, but I regret not getting a sample of Hindu Grass, it sounds like something up my alley.

**Bortnikoff**

• *Dubai* - Fruity and leathery oud in the air, it does strongly remind me of Oud Maracujá. Pretty animalic up close, but balanced well with a fruity sweetness. I see this as a fecal-ish Oud Maracujá overall. The ""fecal"" smell disappears almost completely after a few minutes. 8.5/10

• *Musk Khabib* - The sample's atomizer doesn't work properly but it could spritz out small droplets onto the paper. It smells like a very clean musk, blended extremely well with some smooth, vanillic florals and a touch of spices. I wanna say it makes me think of a cleaning product but not in a bad way at all. 8.5/10

• *Sayat Nova* - I got hit with a very strange smell immediately after spraying it, but not at all in a good way. Oudy, a bit vanillic and fruity but with a medicinal spicy smell. I don't like this on paper. 3/10

• *Amber Cologne* - Clean and musky white floral scent in the air. Way more citrusy up close. They don't smell similar in general but I see this as being in a similar vein to something like Neroli Portofino. 8/10

• *Musk Cologne* - Citrusy, musky, a bit green and also like it has a bit of honey. A very nice blend of citruses and white florals. Not my style of fragrance but it's nice. It turns muskier and softer as it dries, somewhat reminds me of The Musc from Essential Parfums. 8/10

• *Oud Cologne* - Bitter orange with a piney, green note. It doesn't smell that nice, it has a harsh undertone that's throwing me off. I'd have to try this on skin. In fairness it smells better as it dries but the opening is off putting. 6/10

• *Rich* - Animalic oud similar to Dubai's with a slight freshness in the air. Quite peppery up close but still relatively fresh. Not bad. Something about it reminds me of Ombré Leather but I'm not sure what it is. 7/10

• *Lao Oud* - Smokey, leathery oud in the air but balanced with a nice sweetness. Animalic oud up close, but combined with some coffee and honey in a way that it oddly smells like liquor. I'm very intrigued. 8/10

• *Mysterious Oud* - Rosey, citrusy, ambery and slightly honeyed oud scent in the air, very nice and opulent. There's a musky, floral freshness to this up close. I'm guessing this will be more animalic on skin but it smells great on paper. 8.5/10

• *Oud Kinam* - Vanilla, coffee, slightly floral oud with the same bitter orange note from Oud Cologne. It's nice, I'll have to try this on skin. 8/10

• *Oud Maximus* - Honeyed rose and citruses in the air, very nice. Oudy and spicy up close but softer than many of the other fragrances. 8.5/10

• *Oud Monarch* - Soft, floral, slightly powdery and vanillic cacao scent in the air. Oudy up close and it also has the slight boozy feel from Lao Oud. Also softer on the oud like Oud Maximus. 8.5/10

• *Tabac Doré* - A gorgeous vanillic and resinous tobacco scent with a touch of oud. My favorite Bortnikoff off first impressions. 9/10

• *Triad* - A honeyed rose scent in the air, somewhat similar to other fragrances like Oud Maximus. Oudy, animalic and with a slight green harshness up close but well done. 8/10

• *Cologne de Feu* - Citrusy but very bitter, it smells more like lemon/grapefruit rinds than their juice. There's some sweet fruitiness underneath but the bitter citruses overpower it. Not a fan. 6/10

Oud is one of my favorite notes but I find some of these fragrances to be a bit odd or challenging. They all give off a mature vibe, and they also give off a strange ""old"" smell, at least to my nose. The easiest way I can explain it is that it's like the way people think Tom Ford fragrances smell like an ""old man"", I get a similar vibe out of Bortnikoff's oud scents, but more ""old place/house"" than ""old person"". I'm also curious to try some fragrances from Maksim Perfume (the brand of Dmitry Bortnikoff's son, Maksim) but I haven't found any perfumery that sells his fragrances in the US (or Mexico), at least for now.

Some samples and decants I forgot to include in the pictures:

**A Lab on Fire Liquidnight** - Vanilla with just a dash of lime in the air, it smells great. A bit of incense up close but especially hinoki. I'm noticing that I like hinoki frags and this is no different, I'm looking forward to trying this on skin. 8.5/10

**Alexandre J. Black Beetle** - Very peppery patchouli in the air with an underlying sweet freshness. Smells musky and woody up close but with an oudy/leathery funk. Smells much better in the air than up close. 7.5/10

**Mugler A*Men Pure Energy** - Minty juniper, something about this makes me think of Creed. For such a minty frag I appreciate the fact it doesn't smell like toothpaste, this is more airy and diffusive mint instead of creamy. Very masculine, very fresh, I like this a lot. 8.5/10

**YSL La Nuit de L'Homme Bleu Électrique** - This smells spectacular. I get cardamom, ginger and lavender, somewhat fresh and I see why it's called ""Bleu Électrique"". Big shame it's discontinued (and that my sample leaked so I could only get a single spray to test it). 9/10

**Blend Oud Hour** - Musky, fruity and floral in the air, smells like a higher quality and less sharp version of a fragrance my grandmother used to wear. Up close it's soft and vanillic, a bit creamy but still very musky. This leans feminine in my opinion, and it doesn't smell like pineapple at all, at least on paper. Sucks I don't have a sample of Xerjoff's Accento because the note breakdown is basically identical. 8/10",5,1766351359.0,Colognes,0,1.0,False

This must end! And therefore, and therefore, I pronounce the judgment of the Divine Mother upon this phenomenon that denies the Wisdom of the Mother. Will it have an instant effect? Yes and no, will it have an instant visible effect? No! Will these churches crumble tomorrow or at least on Sunday? No.

But it will have an instant effect in the collective consciousness, in going into the minds of those who are open to the wisdom of the Mother. And there are many people in America who are open to this and they are not all women, but the majority of them are women who are open to seeing “Something does not make sense. Why should we who are in a female body be excluded from religion, from decision making processes? Oh yes! We can serve coffee after Sunday service. We can come and clean the toilets in the church. We can bake cookies. We can put on yard sales. But when it comes to making decisions and deciding about doctrine. Oh no! Then we are shut out as if we were second-rate citizens, incapable of coming up with anything valuable. What nonsense is this in today’s day and age?”

1psh40q,https://i.redd.it/34jnczp5hm8g1.jpeg,Update - Fuck,"First of all, thank you everyone for all the responses. I really appreciate all the suggestions and assurances! I feel guilty saying this, but I wasn't nearly as worried as I must've given the impression of. My instinctual reaction was an instant of panic, but it passed pretty quickly. I was really more annoyed than anything.

I actually recently did a good unfuck of most of my apartment. The only things I really needed/need to do in preparation are a good clean of the bathroom, sort out the catch-all area in my entryway, do some backed up dishes & laundry, clear the trash pile that is my coffee table, sweep & mop, and hit a few stains with my carpet cleaner. My bedroom's a disaster, but I was planning to do the same thing I do when maintenance comes over - lock my cats in my room and put a sign on the door saying they're in there and not to enter.

Regardless, I'm so thankful for everyone being so kind, helpful, and reassuring. There have definitely been times in the past where I've been in the shit and had to do frantic last-minute unfucking, and I'm sure I'll have those in the future as well (despite my best efforts.) This community is amazingly helpful to so many people who are struggling to keep a clean, healthy living space, and I'm so glad it exists. Y'all rock.

Over the last couple years I’ve been slowly making boundaries that I feel are necessary for when we have children.. one new one being we spend Christmas morning alone!

My parents are divorced, and are flexible about when they see us and his family does something Christmas Eve dinner and Christmas night dinner… so my parents pick one day for a brunch and still to me it feels like we are running a race for two days and can’t just relax… and to add into the mix my MIL wants to come over before we go to my dads to open presents just with her kids (because they can’t do it in the evening due to their grandparents being there and it’s not as special - we’re adults I don’t get it)

Last year she invited herself over at 7am and I said I won’t make breakfast as we’re going to my dads for brunch (but I still made pastries and fresh fruit and coffee for present opening) - she comes inside my house and goes “oh no breakfast?” I almost raged… then they over stayed when I said we had to leave and lock up and we were super late to my dads (my favourite place I’d wanna be on Christmas)

This year I put my foot down and said we are not having people over or going anywhere before brunch… my husband said ok, then she texted yesterday to ask when we will make a special time outside of the two dinners we will see her to open gifts “privately”

I overheard my husband saying to my cousin this will be the first year he hasn’t opened gifts on Christmas Day with his parents and I felt bad… but my mother in law gets to see us three times over 2 days when my dad gets to see us one day and my mom gets to see us Boxing Day (due to my siblings husbands family planning)

If my mother in law followed the “rules” and boundaries of our family I wouldn’t have an issue… but I know in the future I want the morning to be slow and not stressful with a newborn/toddlers… but now I feel like an asshole for not letting him have this tradition… he said he doesn’t really care, but I’m hyper sensitive and I just feel terrible.. help!",1,1766350988.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1psgwvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1psgwvq/every_single_night_i_hear_furniture_moving/,Every single night I hear furniture moving.,"I finally moved out a few weeks ago, after living with my parents. I will be studying in a different city, so naturally I want to be closer to university.

It's a small town. Very rural, quiet and beautiful. Absolutely perfect for a new chapter in my life.

There are a few flats on the floors above me. I think it's 4 floors in total, not including me at the very bottom. We share the same main entrance that is always open, so literally anyone can open the door and walk into the place whenever they feel like it. Not really a fan of that, but eh. It's only till I finish and pass every semester.
Once inside, you can see the letterboxes for each person that is living in this complex on the left, with their last names attached to them. Then there are stairs in the middle that lead up to the floors above. Also an old elevator which hasn't been used in years, because it is broken. At least I think it is, because there is red tape in the shape of the letter X spread across the metal doors. Whoever did that is certainly not a specialist, because it looks like a first grader put it there. I am not sure whether it'll ever get fixed, but I don't need to use it anyways, since the door to my flat is in front of the letterboxes on the bottom floor. So to the right when you enter the building.
Under the stairs seems to be another door. Maybe to the basement, but I don't really care, because I am only at home to sleep. A green bicycle is standing in front of that specific door. It looks like it hasn't been used in decades.

I spend my days studying at university with my new friends or go out with the same people for some coffee or tea. I usually only stay home on Sundays to watch movies or to play videogames. But every night I hear this weird noise. It sounds like someone is moving furniture around to redecorate their place.
I usually go to bed at 8 pm and just scroll on my phone for one or two hours before putting it down on my nightstand to sleep.
When you enter the room I sleep in, the bed is in the far left corner, my feet facing the door. My head and right side are hugged by the walls. The bathroom is to my right, a wall between the two rooms.

It is 9:00 pm right now, I am doomscrolling through different social media sites when I hear this noise again. Just like every night. It is subtle, but makes the walls vibrate, so it is really irritating. The past nights I tried to cover my ears with wax meant for blocking noise, tried sleeping earlier and even put on headphones to listen to music, but nothing works. The vibrating is causing such a deep tone that manages to go through absolutely everything. No matter what I do, I can hear it. Every. Single. Night. I stay up all night, rolling from side to side, staring at the walls and ceiling. Each time I close my eyes, the noise seems to get louder. I am sick of this, angry and about to cry, because I am feeling helpless. Just when I am about to doze off, my 6:00 am alarm goes off.

I let out a loud sigh, followed by a whiney groan. I cannot believe I spent my entire night not resting at all.
I am exhausted, tired and snap at everything and everyone at this point. I want to make coffee, but the bag with the coffee beans falls over, spreading them across the entire kitchen floor. I bend down to pick them up, but end up hitting my head against one of the kitchen drawers when I try to go back up. Another sigh followed by a whispered ""ouch..."" Okay, surely it cannot get any worse, I think. I'll just make some instant coffee instead. It just needs boiling water and the coffee powder. So I fill the kettle with water, put it on the stove and fill my mug with the instant coffee which was in these tiny, long bags that you just rip open at the top.
I just stand there. Staring at the kettle that was slowly heating up. Eyes unfocused and the vision blurry as it was extremely tiring to focus my eyes after no sleep at all.
Suddenly, a loud whistle throws me back into reality, making me scream from the unexpected high pitched noise. ""Right, the coffee..."" I shake my head, being disappointed at myself, while pouring the hot water into my prepared mug. The powder and spoon are already in there, ready to stir.

With my finished coffee in hand, I drop down on the couch to watch a movie. There is no chance I will go to university today. I haven't slept. How would I be able to pay attention..? As expected, a few minutes after I turned on a random movie, I fall asleep only to be awakened by a horrible quaking and shaking. I sit up immediately, breathing heavily. I can feel my heart pump out of my chest as I grab my phone to use its flashlight. When I try to unlock it, I see the time and freeze. 9:30 pm. Not again. Who the FUCK redecorates their room? Every. Single. Damn. Night?! At the same time too?! Also: Did I really sleep that long..?

With a sigh I get up to pour my cold coffee into the kitchen sink and notice that some stuff had fallen over. With a raised eyebrow, I put everything back into place and walk into the bedroom.
When I enter, a sudden sharp pain fills me and I drop to the floor, grabbing my foot. ""God fucking damnit..."" I say through my clenched teeth. I must have hit my foot against a table that is near the entrance of the room. But how?... It doesn't make any sense to me. I just shake my head violently, wanting to forget about it. It's probably nothing. My brain and body must be fucked up from the restless nights and ruined sleep schedule.

I go to bed. Pull the covers up to my chin and lay on my back, staring at the ceiling. The longer I look at it, the weirder it feels. Something is not right, because usually when I look up, I only see the ceiling. Nothing else. But now I see the ceiling and the corner of my wooden wardrobe. As if someone had pushed it closer to my bed, causing it to be in my line of sight. Now that I think about it, the sounds have stopped.
Quickly, I check my phone that I had placed on the nightstand. 10:15 pm. Strange. This is the first night it stopped sooner. But why..?

Again, I shake my head. I must be seeing things. Even though I had just slept for many hours in one go, I fall asleep quickly once more. All these lost hours from the nights before caught up to me, it seems.

The next morning, my alarm rings at 6:00 am, so I get up, rub my eyes, slowly walk into the bathroom and get ready for uni.
I take my bag, put on my shoes and jacket, grab my keys and leave the apartment. But before I actually take the bus, I check my mail. You never know.
As I stood in front of the letterboxes, I couldn't help but notice that the old, green and rusty bike had fallen over. Odd.
After staring at it for a while, I shrug and leave.

Typical university day. Get up. Leave. Go to uni. Study. Leave. Go home. And go home I did.
When I get into the complex, I realise that someone put the bike back into place, but something about it looks different. I don't know what it is. I mean, it's still green, rusty and ugly.

Whatever. With my keys in hand, I enter my apartment and lock the door behind me. A quick glance at my phone. ""8:00 pm"". Sigh. Another exhausting day done. After a short bathroom visit to change and brush my teeth, I hop to bed and try to relax on my phone, till I eventually pass out.

This night, the moving noises were not as loud which is why I was able to sleep through the night. But when my alarm rings and I wake up, it's... dark.
The air feels thin and heavy. I have trouble breathing. Quickly, I use my phone as a flashlight and get up to hit the lightswitch of my bedroom as fast as I can. I didn't even have to run far. It was only one step to take  which didn't make sense...

Now I stand here frozen in my bedroom. Hand on the lightswitch. Tears in my eyes. My bed only one single step away from me. My wardrobe pressed against the side of the bed. The table touching the end of the bed and brushing my side. The window gone.

I had not been wrong the past few days. Something had indeed been weird. The bike falling over and looking like it is out of position. Me hitting my foot, even though I should be able to walk around my flat blindfolded. The stuff in my kitchen falling. Everything seeming out of place.
No one has been moving stuff around next door all these nights. I knew that. I absolutely knew. Because behind that wall where it has been coming from, is... nothing.
I don't have a neighbour next door, because there is no flat. No room. No furniture. Only the neatly cut grass that surrounds the complex.
The walls had been moving every single night. And tonight, they locked me in. The room is so small and tiny now. This could be a toddler's or baby's room. There is no door I could go through. No window. No toilet. No water or food. And eventually, I will either die from no oxygen or get crushed by these walls.",5,1766350734.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Are there any all-in-one stain/refinishing products that could accomplish this with minimal effort?

After weighing the reponses, I took Inserter. I was convinced by the points that because of 2x Charge Battery and the Happy Flower, that I wasn’t starved for energy and my cards weren’t energy hungry. Also, the point that my deck couldn’t reliably make 20+ block in the first few turns meant I was going to take more than 7 damage per fight. 

Both of these points turned out to be correct. I didn’t find myself wanting for energy very often and I did take significant damage so much so that Imhad to use my first two campfires for resting, something that wouldn’t have been possible if I had took Coffee Dripper.

I did end up beating Tri-Slavers, Gremlin Leader, and the Champ, but I really felt like I was on death’s door the entire time.

I work as an inspector for construction. It can be busy at times, especially in the busy season for us. Funnily enough has nothing to do with my education, being kinesiology. 

I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, camping, bridge or cliff jumping into water, or slow relaxing nights watching a movie. It is nice to spend time with those you care about and just appreciate the laughs and fun with them. Big movie fan, also love coffee and good food. I do enjoy working out and sports as well. I try to keep healthy with fitness and what I eat. 

My journey in my faith has certainly been an interesting one. I came to it genuinely and seriously while in college. I began digging into the word and repented and turned my life around. Simply put I desire to live according to God's rightly divided word, as I come to more understanding through study. Feel free to ask anything about it that you may have questions on.
I simply identify as Christian, or a follower of the Way in other words.  

I am looking for someone who simply wants to pursue God genuinely and live according to what God teaches as they know as well. As they grow, just someone willing to continue growing when faced with more understanding. Of course a best friend who I can share the ups and downs of life with, fun adventures and all. Humor is a big one as well haha. Physical attraction is part of it, would prefer someone who is healthy and takes care of themselves. 

25-35 not a hardset but just an outline. 

Willing to do long distance of course if I find the right person. 

Looking forward to hearing from people.

I'm new to espresso coffee and want a good starter coffee machine. I usually drink Arabic brewed coffee and don't plan on stopping, but thought that adding espresso to my morning and afternoon options might be a good idea.

From what I read and hear so far, **grinders are as important as the machine**. I looked at the **Ninja Luxe** but opinions seem either very well or people asking for refunds. Another option available in my area and well within what I plan on spending is the **Gaggia EG2109** (with built-in PID).

I'd love updated thoughts on both and some advice, as threads seem to be outdated and don't reflect the latest features of both. Also, what is a good starter grinder that is like $50-$100 max?",1,1766349694.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I have this laminated pine wood that I am cutting up and upcycling from an old IKEA coffee table. I kind of like the rustic look, but I want to bring out the color and maybe make it a little darker. Pic 3 is after sanding - what process would be good if I wanted to both refinish and mildly stain this? 

The previous stain is basically eboni black. I considered a two-step process of restaining in black with a wipe on stain, and then top coating with polyurethane, but the weather is cold here and I only have so much time outside to use all these products and wait for them to dry, plus I'm in a wet/humid climate.

Are there any all-in-one stain/refinishing products that could accomplish this with minimal effort? 

I looked into Howard's 'Restor-a-finish' product, which looks like it might work, but it also looks like it goes on top of already finished wood. Would it work on sanded (non-prepped) wood? any other recommendations would be awesome. ",1,1766349682.0,wood,0,1.0,False

1psgaqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1psgaqu/because_of_the_implication/,"""Because of the Implication""","Nothing seems like a greater deterrent to dating than success. I don’t know what it is about this generation of men, but it feels like the more accomplished I get, the more I seem to attract the riff-raff. Years of winning medals for the swim team in college brought enough publicity to keep the good ones away while attracting those who fed off my fame like vampires. It’s not that I didn’t know this would happen. My mother always warned me. Traditional men don’t want someone submissive, they want someone independent that they can break. 

And I knew I would never fall for it. At least that’s what I thought, until I met Richard.   
  
He had this softness about him that I didn’t quite expect. His charm, passion, and fake feminism drew me in like a sucker. Maybe all those years in a dating desert gave me an unquenchable thirst, a longing. Or maybe anyone would have fallen prey to him. There was, after all, something otherworldly about him. 

It started with a book. I left my copy of “All about love” behind in my favorite coffee shop. When I came to retrieve it, his hand met mine.  
  
“Excuse me.” I glanced at the handsome stranger.   
  
“Ah, you found my book.” He smiled.

  
“Uh, that’s my book.” I showed him the front page with a dramatic flourish. My name was as legible as chicken scratch.

  
“So it is.” He mused.   
  
“You read bell hooks?” I asked.  
  
“Shouldn’t everyone?” He raised an eyebrow.   
  
I faltered for a second. Don’t fall for it. This has to be his schtick or something.   


“Did you forget your matcha latte and canvas tote as well?”  
  
“I think if more men spent time actually trying to become the men they pretend to be, women wouldn’t need to be so cautious of them.” His words felt like honey and I, the hungry bear, fell for his trap.   
  
He was entirely too handsome and it made me incredibly nervous. I fiddled with my metal lighter as we spoke. I swung the lid open and closed. The repetition and sound helped relieve some of my stress.  
  
“Do you smoke?” He asked, with clear apprehension on his face.  
  
“Ah, not anymore. I just carry this for…luck I guess.” My mom had given it to me before she died. It was the only thing I had left from her.  
  
He looked relieved. “Oh good. I have very delicate lungs. I don’t do very well around smoke.” 

“Noted.” I nodded. “I’m Charlie by the way.”  
  
“Richard but you can call me-”

“Dick?” I stifled a laugh.   
  
His smile was infectious. “I was going to say Richie, but honestly you can call me anything you’d like.”  
  
“Including Dick?”  
  
“Maybe *almost* anything.”   
  


A simple moment in time set in motion a wildfire of passion. The dates, late night phone calls, naughty encounters, and delivered flowers swept me up like nothing had before. He was both the perfect gentleman and the perfect savage. He satisfied me in every way I wanted.   
  
Except for a gnawing voice at the back of my head. It seemed too calculated, too real. Almost as though he was programmed as the lead character in my otome game. He seemed to know my every move before I even made it. I was so far gone, drunk on his attention, I didn’t even notice the small ways he was chipping away at my life. Until, one day, he invited me on a trip.   
  
“I’ve never been on a cruise before.” I confessed.   
  
“That makes it even more exciting. I get to see you experience everything for the first time.” He was too convincing. I wish I had put up more of a fight or at least listened to that raw unease in my gut every time I thought about it.   
  
It was not your standard, commercial cruise of three thousand guests. Other than the crew, only thirteen total of us boarded. A very intimate arrangement. The ship itself was about a fourth the size of a typical cruise ship, with all the suites being at least two thousand square feet each. Every unit was equipped with its own outdoor hot tub and veranda. I let my imagination consider all the possible things we could do in that private hot tub, overlooking the ocean.   
  
After we boarded and left the harbor, Richard led me to my room, where I would be staying by myself. I felt like I had my own mini apartment. At first I thought Richard would be sharing the room with me, but he insisted I feel like a princess on this trip. He said his room would be next door if I needed anything.   
  
“Distance makes the heart grow fonder, my love.” At this point he’d grow accustomed to kissing my hand so I didn’t think much of it at the time.   
  
“I guess.” 



“Let me know when you’ve settled in. I can’t wait for you to meet the other guests.”



What I expected was to meet work acquaintances, people he played pickle ball with, or his neighbors. Nothing could have prepared me for the truth.   
  
I met Richard in the ballroom wearing the dress he’d picked out for me. It was gold and made of thousands of tiny pieces of metal, likely connected together by hand. The fabric made a lovely rustle as I walked and felt deliciously cool on my skin. He greeted me warmly and took a moment to behold my appearance.   
  
“You’re more beautiful than a galaxy. And believe me, I would know.” He kissed my cheek gently.   
  
“Thank you.”  
  
“Come.” He led me to join the rest of the group. “Let me introduce you to my collection.”  
  
My heart sank at his words and my eyes looked on in horror. Twelve women, various beauties of different backgrounds and body types stood before me, all wearing the same dress as me.  
  
“Your…*collection?*” I spat in disbelief. 



“Now, now. Don’t be that way. I chose you because you are exceptional. Just like every one of these ladies.” He beckoned to them and they flocked like obedient pets, surrounding him, and doting on him.   
  
“I thought you loved me.”   
  


“I do.” He insisted. “Just like I love them.” He walked around slowly kissing the hand of each woman. The gesture disgusted me, my own hand burning at the realization.  
  
“The thing about flowers” he mused, “Is that they wilt too soon to truly enjoy their beauty. If you let me, I can show you a way you will never wilt. Captured in perfection forever.” He smiled and slowly outstretched his arms to me. “Come Charlotte. I promise the procedure will be painless.”  
  
“Come” His woman army echoed mindlessly.  
  


“Oh hell no.” I immediately bolted back to my room. Richard was close behind, followed by his entourage in heels.   
  
“Please stop, you’re only making this more difficult for yourself.” He seemed so calm and it angered me more. “There’s nowhere to go. We are in the middle of the ocean.”  
  
“Shut up!” I removed one of my heels and threw it at his face. He caught it with insane precision and closed the gap between us.   
  
I felt his hand snatch my left ankle and my face suddenly met the deck. Dazed but pumped on adrenaline, I removed my other heel and jammed it into his face. He let out a gurgling scream. I wiggled back and forth till I freed myself from his almost superhuman grip. I ignored the crunching sound and searing pain. My only goal was survival.   
  
As I limped away, his doting army surrounded him to try to tend to his wounds, letting out unearthly calls of distress.   
  
After I reached my room, I bolted the door, and searched for the orange life vest. Richard and the women pounded on the door furiously. I knew it wouldn’t hold for very long.  
  
Suddenly a glimmer of metal caught my eye. My lucky lighter lay ceremoniously on the bed where I had left it. “Sensitive lungs eh?” I ripped open the mini bar and started emptying them all on the bed. With one rip of my lighter I set a coffee filter aflame. Dropping onto the bed, it ignited quickly and grew. I rushed out to the veranda with the life vest and shut the door on the flames spreading behind me.



As I climbed on the metal railing, my left ankle buckled with pain. I knew there was a chance I wouldn’t generate enough force to clear the decks below. You’ve got this Charlie. You’ve got this. With all the force I could muster, I dove from the deck towards the ocean water. 



They say traditional men want someone independent they can break and he did break me. That bastard broke my ankle in two places. What he didn’t count on was how flammable his ship was. I watched it burn down as I swam back towards my freedom.

The more we learn about mental illness, the more we understand that it's not a singular thing. Depression isn't just sadness, anxiety isn't just worry, bipolar disorder isn't just mood swings. They're all complex interactions of factors: environmental, genetic, physiological, social. But still, they’re viewed in a singular dimension by many, defined only by their simplest traits. 

This leads me to ponder: how can we better express the complex nature of mental health for better understanding in society?",1,1766348451.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False
1psg1er,https://i.redd.it/97ttwetq8m8g1.jpeg,My 2K25 Hyatt Ratings,"Hi, all, Happy Holidays. This was the first year I organically hit Globalist, largely due to an uptick in work travel. Some personal context about me: I’m always in search of a breakfast cold brew or iced coffee option, I prioritize public transit or bike share options over Uber/Lyft, and I’m relatively price-conscious (although starting to accumulate enough points that I’m excited to see what happens with 2026). If you’re looking for Chicago Hyatt data points, this is a good post for you. Let’s get to it.

Thompson Washington DC - 7/10 - This was the first Thompson I ever stayed at and I’ve come to appreciate the brand’s room details: furniture, bathroom tiling, dark wood all over the place. I did multiple stays here this year and rooms ranged from a standard king to jr. suite (really just a bigger, L-shaped room). Breakfast was all right on paper and spotty in execution (iced coffee was pretty good some stays and tasted like hot coffee poured over ice some others). The hotel has a pair of beautiful Cannondale e-bikes it can lend out… and doesn’t keep them maintained. Flat tires and no pump on site, so pretty much useless. The Achilles heel of this property is its location. Navy Yard kind of sucks. 

Andaz Vienna - 7/10 - Great service and proactively upgraded to a suite with a great view. Convenient to Vienna’s train station while still being far enough away to about too much street crowding. Breakfast buffet was fine, no iced coffee option (my principal breakfast criteria). 

Hyatt Place Amsterdam Airport - 5/10 - Reliable shuttle, 20-minute walk to a train station. Room was clean, just wouldn’t stay here again unless I was catching a flight early the next morning out of AMS. Nothing wrong with the property, just felt like such a sacrifice move relative to staying in town. With that said, great value relative to staying in Amsterdam proper. 

Dreams Jardin Tropical Resort & Spa, Tenerife - 6/10 - Pools were clean, and the drinks at the more exclusive area up top were surprisingly decent. Rooms were okay, bathroom could use a lot of work. Service was very friendly. Lots of tired furniture all over, in an area of Tenerife that also seems to have had its heyday a while ago. Overrun by British tourists, which I’ll say are pretty good for people watching. 

Hyatt Regency LAX - 6/10 - Large king bed room, no upgrade both times I stayed. Nice view of the south side of the airport and okay breakfast (no iced coffee). Scoring this one slightly higher because of how well it executes at being a hotel airport. Highly convenient, 10-minute walk to the United terminal. Now that the LA metro goes to the airport I might stay further into town next time. 

Cambria Beach Lodge - 4/10 - Conversely, this might score lower because of the inconvenience of dealing with MMS. The property itself is fine (think of a roadside motel that’s been nicely renovated and is in a great location across the street from the ocean). MMS sucks, that’s all there is to it. The extreme availability variance in search results, the billing issues I’ve had every single time, the Globalist line’s complete inability to work on your behalf to get things resolved. (“Mr. & Mrs. Smith? What’s that? Oh, I had no idea!” Every time.) If you stay at an MMS property, be sure you’re locked in with your plans and do not change your dates. You will likely still get charged twice in some capacity and everyone will say it’s not their responsibility. Aside from that, loved the elephant seals nearby. 

Hyatt Place Windsor - 2/10 - Took my dad to Detroit for an NHL game and we stayed in Windsor partly for the novelty and partly because Detroit’s Hyatt situation needs work. Bad location (lots of trucks, lots of street racing), not much to write home about here. CBP officer was perfectly nice on the drive back into America. 

Hyatt Regency Tokyo Bay - 3/10 - Nice enough hotel which feels like a good option because it’s one of Tokyo’s last remaining affordable Hyatts. Felt like an extreme sacrifice move to stay here instead of a more central location. Don’t really remember breakfast, bottom line is you’re paying 1/4 as much for no better than 1/4 the experience. 

Hyatt Centric Ginza Tokyo - 7/10 - Locked in a night here on points before the category jump. I’d prob score this higher if it was still a Cat 6 property. It’s very nice, very centrally located, best breakfast I’ve had this year, and there just isn’t enough juice here to merit a Cat 7 increase. I get that there’s an overarching corporate strategy to pump up Tokyo prices/categories, and I guess this demonstrates why my next trip to Japan will focus on areas other than Tokyo (as much as I loved my time there). Big fan of the complimentary Suntory Highballs. 

Hyatt Centric 5th Ave NY - 6/10 - Upgraded to a slightly larger room with a pretty excellent view of the Empire State Building. I stayed here one night ahead of a work meeting and honestly don’t remember a whole lot else. Skipped breakfast in lieu of a bagel and iced coffee from a place next to Bryant Park, so I must have scouted the menu and noticed no iced coffee option for Globalist breakfast. I’d stay here again but honestly nothing too memorable. Midtown in a nutshell. 

Hyatt Place Long Island City - 7/10 - The last stand of the Cat 4 NYC hotels. I kind of like this one. LIC is… if not the most interesting neighborhood at least proximate to Astoria. I got the rare HP suite upgrade and there’s a Tacombi across the street. This one punches above its weight. 

Hyatt Recency Columbus - 5/10 - Stayed for a night as I was moving to my new city. Upgraded to suite. Skipped breakfast (no iced coffee). The Blue Angels were also staying here for the Columbus air show that weekend, and if it’s good enough for our finest naval aviators it’s good enough for me. 

Hyatt Regency ORD -7/10 - In the back half of the year I started traveling to Chicago about every other week for work. I dreaded the idea of staying at this hotel after having lived in Chicago for years (the building exterior is ugly as hell, Rosemont is not Chicago, I miss Montrose Beach, blah blah blah). Turns out it’s not so bad, especially if you’re a Globalist. I’ve stayed here 4-5 times and have been upgraded to a suite each time, and these run the range from hilarious two-floor deals with a spiral staircase to relatively recently updated suites in the premium tower. Absolutely massive TVs. Breakfast has no iced coffee but I’m learning to live with it. 5 minute walk to the Blue Line. 

Hyatt Centric ORD - 7/10 - Oh how I wish this hotel’s location and the Regency ORD’s were swapped. Newer, better bar, better breakfast (iced coffee!), and Bee Kind is 1000x better than Pharmacopia. Unfortunately, this one is about 30 min north of the Blue Line walking, and I tend to get the Recency for about 3/4 the price so it tends to win out. If the locations were swapped this would be an 8 and the Regency would score like a 5. 

Hyatt Regency SFO - 3/10 - I’ve stayed here a few times now and every time feels like a sacrifice move I’m making just to stay at a Hyatt vs. the Bonvoy options up the street. Suites inexplicably face the 101 instead of San Francisco Bay, and they’re all on the second floor so road noise is a legitimate issue. The airport shuttle bus is a recurring nightmare. I keep booking it, though, so I only have myself to blame. 

Thompson Atlanta - 6/10 - Redeemed a Cat 4 certificate in maybe the last two weeks before it left Hyatt. Got a corner suite, and the bars were nice. Service was pretty chancy, which I wasn’t terribly surprised by given the imminent rebrand. If this was still an option, I’ve historically had better stays at the Kimpton across the street. 

Hotel Lincoln - 5/10 - I just don’t like this hotel as much as I wish I did. It does have its pros. It’s got the best location of any Chicago Hyatt. I love being in Lincoln Park vs. the Loop, River North, Streeterville, or Gold Coast. It’s a little quieter, and you’re a short walk or Divvy ride from restaurants, the beach, your office downtown. And the renovated rooms aren’t bad. It’s a really good pick for those who want to explore more of the North Side. It also has a solid rooftop bar. 

But it also has a lot of negatives. Service has been lackluster. The last time I was there, the front desk legit tried to gaslight me into thinking that a base double bed room was a suite. They’ve refused to merge two one-night reservations and have compelled me to switch rooms despite what looked and felt like low occupancy. While breakfast does have a good iced coffee option, that comes at the expense of anything else as there are basically pre-packaged egg sandwiches to go with the delicious cold brew. Even the renovated rooms have pretty cheap furniture, and by this point hotels should have Chromecast functionality. If the weather’s good I’m content to stay here and let the prime location do its work. If not, though, I’m probably staying elsewhere. This hotel can be and should be much better. 

Grand Hyatt Atlanta - 8/10 - A nice little gem, and staying here made me way less sad about the Thompson down the road disappearing. Nice bar, very nice rooms, this hotel is on a strong path forward after its renovation. I did prefer the ex-Thompson’s location more, and the Globalist breakfast is a just-okay Club offering with, naturally, no iced coffee option. Otherwise this is a strong recommend and just two blocks away from the Buckhead MARTA station. 

Hyatt Regency MCO - 6/10 - Like LAX, convenience dominates at this hotel. Nice enough room, and the breakfast burrito was pretty decent for breakfast (no iced coffee). 

Hyatt Regency Coconut Point & Spa - 8/10 - Great SUA upgrade here. Multiple pool options with accompanying lazy river and water slides. I did appreciate that they comped the parking, as well, given the lack of street parking. My favorite thing about this property by far is the boat that takes you to an off-property island across the channel. Lots of wildlife viewing opportunities. The restaurant situation is not great, pretty lackluster breakfast and dinner. But otherwise I’d recommend a stay here. 

Hyatt Centric Guatemala City - 6/10 - Good Zona 10 location, room was nice enough. Breakfast was spotty, good one day with a nice iced latte and lackluster the next with hot coffee over ice. The rooftop pool was small but a great temperature, and unfortunately surrounded by dirty glass partitions that obstructed much of the view. This was a hotel with a lot of common use space that was constantly off limits due to prepping for events later on in the day/evening. Good for them, I suppose. 

Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile - 6/10 - Nice suite upgrade to a very large room with decent Streeterville views. Bar was all right, and breakfast was just okay (no iced coffee option, lol they should put that on my tombstone). The immediate proximity to Northwestern Hospital isn’t great unless that’s the reason you’re there (which it clearly was for many guests). Viable option, all in all. The suite did a lot of lifting in this case. 

Thompson Chicago - 9/10 - I really enjoyed my stay here and might honestly rethink my Chicago travel to be here more often (although if you’re still reading this, open to suggestions). Really like the location, Oak St. Beach would be an easy walk in the summer. Upgraded to a jr. suite with wraparound windows and a great north-facing view that I thoroughly enjoyed. The room, hallways, and hotel exterior really felt like stepping into an early-80s time capsule in the best way. Nothing felt old or in a state of disrepair, just felt like they nailed a particular aesthetic with the dark browns and purples and leopard patter hallway carpet. The only constructive notes I had after a one-night stay was that the shower wasn’t the best (glass box that felt very constricting) and, of course, no iced coffee at breakfast (although the croissant sandwich was excellent).

I've decided to maybe try and join the sharing too. I wanted to and even earlier but always was forgetting to do photos today I did too for some of what I ate.

I started my day with milk banana shake with musli, protein powder and one part of WW chocolate bar. Then I ate the rest of the bar.

I had a 50-50 milk to water coffee on my break.

And after work I stopped by at KFC with my sister. Had a hot-dog there (which was awful, I hate mustard and should've assumed it would be in it), coca-cola, 2 hot wings and some fries.

At evening I already regretted the KFC and felt guilty-be my dietetican recommends me to avoid fast foods and trying to replace them with healthy options- and be I definitely shouldn't have ate that much in one go. Should've ate smaller portion and then leftovers later. Unhealthy processed food in big amount costed me feeling like I would need to use toilet if I ate anything more. At that point I still lacked to my daily goal but couldn't stomach anything. And realized I basically drank nothing during the day to stay hydrated so I had 2 cups of homemade juice and one cup of water afterwards (I also just was feeling thirsty and dry and that was the moment I realized that). That got rid of unpleasant feeling in my throat and now I could drink the yogurt to reach my calorie goal.

It was a lazy day for food preparation on my part and for tomorrow I definitely plan to add vegetables/fruits and maybe things like rice",5,1766348220.0,recoveryplates,3,0.78,False

Over the last couple years I’ve been slowly making boundaries that I feel are necessary for when we have children.. one new one being we spend Christmas morning alone!

My parents are divorced, and are flexible about when they see us and his family does something Christmas Eve dinner and Christmas night dinner… so my parents pick one day for a brunch and still to me it feels like we are running a race for two days and can’t just relax… and to add into the mix my MIL wants to come over before we go to my dads to open presents just with her kids (because they can’t do it in the evening due to their grandparents being there and it’s not as special - we’re adults I don’t get it)

Last year she invited herself over at 7am and I said I won’t make breakfast as we’re going to my dads for brunch (but I still made pastries and fresh fruit and coffee for present opening) - she comes inside my house and goes “oh no breakfast?” I almost raged… then they over stayed when I said we had to leave and lock up and we were super late to my dads (my favourite place I’d wanna be on Christmas)

This year I put my foot down and said we are not having people over or going anywhere before brunch… my husband said ok, then she texted yesterday to ask when we will make a special time outside of the two dinners we will see her to open gifts “privately”

I overheard my husband saying to my cousin this will be the first year he hasn’t opened gifts on Christmas Day with his parents and I felt bad… but my mother in law gets to see us three times over 2 days when my dad gets to see us one day and my mom gets to see us Boxing Day (due to my siblings husbands family planning)

If my mother in law followed the “rules” and boundaries of our family I wouldn’t have an issue… but I know in the future I want the morning to be slow and not stressful with a newborn/toddlers… but now I feel like an asshole for not letting him have this tradition… he said he doesn’t really care, but I’m hyper sensitive and I just feel terrible.. help!",2,1766348212.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False

1psfvv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1psfvv2/wibta_for_asking_for_an_early_transfer_to_a/,WIBTA for asking for an early transfer to a different store because my coworkers ignored that I was going on vacation,"I (22F) work at a chain coffee shop, yes probably the one you are thinking of. I NEVER take time off instead of the once in a blue moon where I call out because im sick, and am currently sitting on about 80 hours of sick time off, both due to me rarely getting sick and being stubborn when it comes to calling out in general. 

I recently transfered to a new store and to say the least, its been stressful to the point it sent me to the hospital for chest pains so bad I thought I was having a heart attack, and I havent been able to take my adderal or drink coffee to keep my blood pressure down as heart disease runs in my family. How transfer works is once you do so, you cant again for 6 months, however the district manager (DM) can sometimes make an exception. I loved the store i came from but was being prevented from promoting and transfered to a new store in hopes that I could, but im being stalled. 

To put it short, Im VERY good at what I do. Im efficient and fast while staying within standards, and never have to remake a drink. I am constantly on the hardest positions on the store during peak (the busiest time) because it never fall behind while maintaining drink quality. In short the reason why I was and currently being held back is because of this, as well as my reliability to come in when im both scheduled or when they need a shift filled. If they promoted me, it would take me off the general floor as I would be calling the play, and calling me in would raise labor as I would be getting paid more.

I've worked at every store in the district and generally get along well with everyone, but to be honest I dont feel like I fit in very well. I used to be able to have conversations so naturally with people at my old store but it now feels forced. Its a stressful environment as half the people are new and I feel like im shouldering responsibility beyond my paygrade, but as everyone's gotten so used to it if I ever fall short I get interrogated because of it. I get the feeling that im tolerated and nothing more. One time coorperate made a surprise visit and waited 15 minutes to pick up their drinks and then when they got them they complained they were melted. I got told if something happened like that again I would get written up despite it not being my fault. 

With all that being said I made a call to the DM a couple weeks ago and she got in touch with my SM who I had a conversation with. I decided I wouldn't force a transfer and try to stay and see of things would get better because they were starting to. 

Now brings me to today. 3 months ago I requested 3 days off which I never do and my SM granted it. I was taking a trip to Las Vegas as I am in a small band as apart of a program at a music instruction place that is doing a show at a local bar that they arranged 3 months prior. My grandparents let me stay at their time share since I would already be spending alot of money being there. At my old store, people would constantly be interested and asking about my trips and shows and never try to call me in because they actually cared and remembered. 

Flash forward to now the same trip ive been talking about for 3 months at work has suddenly become conviniently forgotten by my store. I am already sick and battling a cold hoping I can even sing tonight and ive gotten 3  different people, 3 from my store, one of them being the ASM (the one who makes the schedule) asking me to fill in a shift. I am from California so that's already a 4 hour drive back home. My store even CALLED me last night (they arent supposed to they can only text, the shift lead is new) and asked me to fill a shift. I once again repeated for the 4th time I am in a completely different state taking the only vacation ive had for 6 years. I've been on my own since I was 18 and have fought for years to maintain financial stability, and this was my first vacation that I was able to afford. 

I've had a few people tell me to put my phone on do not disturb, but I currently have a family member who is in bad health in the hospital and may not make it, so its not an option as I could recieve the call from a number of family members. My grandparents also arent in the greatest health, so you can see why that isn't possible. 

The bottom line is not them inherently asking for coverage, as they do sometimes and I come in and cover willingly to get hours. Its that seemingly everyone ignored I was going on vacation including management despite me notifying people and talking about it regularly. This wouldn't have happened at my old store, but I am not able to return as I recently moved in with my coworker from that store and as we are both trying to promote it is considered a conflict of interest, but there is another store i enjoy covering at that is also conviniently minutes from our house i would like to transfer to. I've finally realized that no one cares beyond what is surface level unlike my old store. Maybe im overreacting as im emotional from sleep deprivation and being sick (thanks to one of said coworkers who refused to wear a mask) but im just tired of it.

Maybe its a little of both or neither at all.  As I wrap my evening with the bros up and see them out and off home. Turning from the lock of the front door The quietness of the morning really sets and settles iin. 

As I watch the sun rise with a hot coffee in hand listening to the birds going off and chirping. There you are, arriving right on time. As beautiful as I remember, the memory's heavily enter and my thoughts once again questioned–Why are you the first and last thought I have in my days? 

I know its neither of the above mentions bcoz in my mind they aren't the thoughts I attach with you. Its more a yearning for the touch of your hand, wanting to feel the warmth of your soul and hold you as tight as I once did. Missing you, still takes its toll. 

Im an atheist but for you– I still try to pray. That your happy everyday, that I pray life is treating you well now & hoping that the family is doing great.

The memory's fall right into the middle of my lap and hearing your voice speak through past memories is enough for me. To not enter your personal space. Bcoz if you wanted me there, than you would. 

Erghhh these heavy thoughts that Im blessed to have experienced, definitely weigh more somedays than I think  they ever should...
