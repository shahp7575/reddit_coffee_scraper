As a long-time viewer and supporter of your content, I feel that it is my duty as a member of this community to correct you when you are wrong. When I say wrong, I mean errant, as I do not want to assume any malice, as this could just be a misunderstanding on your part. 

In the stream on April 12th, 2025, titled 'Atrioc Reacts to the Most Genius Bank Heist Ever' on the Atrioc VODs channel, I saw you exhibit behaviour that is wholly unacceptable and requires some sort of apology or rectification. 

At 46:40 of the VOD, you play a video of our esteemed Education Secretary, the honorable Mrs. Linda McMahon. In this speech, she describes her insight into the great upcoming changes that will revolutionize education in America. The advent of A1 into education will, in my opinion, be a moment etched in history, remembered with the same reverence as the signing of the Declaration of Independence or Liberty day. Yet instead of critically engaging with her bold and innovative arguments, you continuously mischaracterized her arguments.

Firstly, you condescendingly asserted that her use of the phrase A1 was due to her misunderstanding it with Artificial Intelligence. And secondly, you described the Korean education system as the greatest in the world. I would, on behalf of all the brave patriots in this community, like to correct you and educate you in the new ways of the government which might be hard to comprehend at your age.

Among the main promises made by Trump during the election as a central point to his manifesto, was to bring the price of groceries at the store down. Another major promise was that he would bring back American Jobs. Now, with this dual mandate in mind, any effective administrator needs to assess the needs of the people, their culture, and act according to them. At the forefront of American cuisine is the well-known delicacy, 'Steak'. Steak, as I'm sure you're aware, is most commonly made of the flesh of the Cow(sometimes caffeinated). The United States of America, being the world's largest cattle producer by a significant margin, has grown its GDP to the largest in the world by focusing on a pastoral economy and developing animal husbandry. Yet, despite this fact, the number one accompaniment to steak, 'the steak sauce', is produced in the United Kingdom. Not only does this take away jobs from the hardworking sauce manufacturers of America, but it also widens the US's already wide trade deficit with the world. 

As such, Mrs. McMahon intends to bring education about A1, the popular steak sauce, back into American schools. Building the sauce industry in the US will not only help reduce the trade deficit and provide jobs to Millions of Americans, but it will also put us in charge of a strategic resource that could be used by America's Adversaries to force us into using an alternate condiment with our steaks. Imagine eating a beautiful steak with (TRIGGER WARNING) ranch, mustard, or ketchup. The thought alone is horrific, and I apologise to any readers afflicted with that mental image. Therefore, I believe Mrs. McMahon's plan is not only brilliant, but was also criticised unfairly. Big A also used Ad Hominem attacks to call Mrs. McMahon unqualified for the job due to her lack of qualifications and her history in wrestling. But have you considered that maybe wrestling can help solve the obesity epidemic in America? Heart disease is the #1 killer in America and Big A is trying to criticise someone who just wants to solve this problem for the good of all red-blooded Americans.

  
Now, onto my second contention. Big A characterises the North Korean education system as the best in the world and even praises their Education Secretary for his education. But have you considered the age-old proverb, those who can't do teach? Perhaps Mrs. McMahon, who hasn't studied a day in her life, might be better equipped to educate others. You also failed to consider that perhaps the Korean Ed. Secretary, with his many degrees, might just be a big nerd. Do we want our next generation of kids to be weird fart sniffing woke nerds or do we want them to be like the WWE wrestlers whom Mrs. McMahon has coached for decades. I can't speak for you, but I'd prefer the WWE gigachads any day. There is also the problem that the North Korean education system, as demonstrated in the Documentary Squid Game (available on Netflix), forces students into a competition to the death. The reason why they get better results might be because Kim Jong Un has no problems putting his students in a deathmatch until only the best remains. But America was founded on the principle that ""all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness"". If Big A wants to follow a more North Korea-style Authoritarian government, he would be going against what our founding fathers so eloquently wrote. 

While Big A and the sheeple are distracted by the AI hype bubble, Trump is focusing his chips where it really matters- steak sauce. He's playing Uno while you're not even sure if the 6 is a 9.

With my contentions wrapped up, I only ask for two things as Compensation and Penance for the damage inflicted :

a. Popathon 2

b. A sincere apology to Mrs. McMahon for misunderstanding A1 as AI.

I await your move. If you do not respond soon, I will tweet at President Trump to raise the tariff on coffee and glizzies. You have 48 Hours to respond.",2,1744884314.0,atrioc,0,1.0,False

Or maybe I just got overwhelmed by the coffee rabbit hole and with random people on the internet scolding me about getting the right grinder lol.

First things first the taste is…simply delectable. I feel like words cant do it much justice - the way it will improve your mornings with that delicioso smell and taste - just beautiful. Beautiful.



They have 4 roasts:

100% Arabica - Crema Cassica - Crema Superiore - Espresso Intenso



My favourite is first the 100% Arabica, and then the Espresso. I need that kick. Ill mainly be talking about the Arabica here, but most things apply to all of them.



Now getting into some details here that you might be interested in:

**Aroma: 9.5 -** It’s my favourite smell

**Roast:**  Medium

**Acidity: 3.5**

Cremas are supposedly not acidic, and I didn't find this to be.

**Taste**: Hint of Chestnut and Caramel (Every flavour has a different taste tone, like the Crema Classica has Dark Chocolate and Hazelnut, and Crema Surperiore has Toasted Almond and Brown Sugar)

**Sweetness: 5.75**

It's generally  not a sweet coffee, but contains jussst enough sweetness so that you dont get overwhelmed with the bitter notes - but can still taste/feel them.

**Bitterness: 9**

The bitterness is the best feature. Im not talking about the 100% Arabica here, but more about the flavoured versions ….it is not the horrible bitterness you get from overextracted coffee, but instead it's the ""good"" bitterness that you’ll actually enjoy tasting.

**Other notes:**

It is certified organic, if that matters to you.

Now coming to comparisons…. It is probably the best Arabica/Robusta blends you will get at this price point. It is well worth the money if you want a decent espresso and a reasonable price. It’s currently 23-28$ for 2.2 pounds. There are more weight options with different prices ofcourse which you’ll just have to see for yourself.

======

\[Keith! Wake up!\] the motherly, yet firmly voice woke the young Basitin up. Or at least tried to.

\[Mmm... Five more minutes...\] Keith mumbled while snuggling deeper into the pillow.

Cathleen sighed. Then she grabbed the blanket and took it away, \[Wake up, sleepyhead!\]

\[Ma!\] he turned into a fluffball, \[I don't have my ankle wrappings!\]

\[You literally came out of me. I saw a whole of you. Now, get up! It's almost noon.

Keith mumbled a little more and got up. He took the wrappings from the drawer and put them on his ankles and tail. But his mom was still unsatisfied,

\[You sneaked out at night again, did you?\]

The boy blushed and avoided the sight of his mother, \[N-No...\] and lied so badly that it was somewhat adorable,

\[Keith, darling...\] she wasn't mad but disappointed. But not the scary type. She knelt and raised the child's head, \[You're thirteen years old. You have to act a bit more disciplined\]

\[I know...\] Keith played with his foot, \[I just... I don't like the army school...\]

\[You're just like your father when he was in your age\]

Keith's eyes perked up, \[Really?\]

\[Mmhmm. He was like you. He was rebellious, sneaked out from lessons, got into fights...\]

\[But my dad always scolds me for bad grades!\]

Mom chuckled, \[He was inch from expulsion! That's how bad he was!\]

\[No way! Then... what changed?\]

\[He met me, of course! He fell in love at first sight. But... I wanted someone who could settle down... That's when your father hits the books. In few months, he became the star soldier... that's when he proposed to me! We had an amazing night...\]

[Poor Keith...](https://preview.redd.it/9c3jij55cdve1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a6b92eb8dc2a77c2962663a1d7c369c5fd210f)

Keith tried to cover his ears and scream but that wasn't enough. The mental image of his parents doing it is burned forever in his mind.

\[Maaaaaaaa!!!\]

\[You could avoid that if you get your butt on time\] she smiled innocently, \[Now get dressed. Your friends are waiting for you\]

Hearing that, the young Basitin quickly put on clothes and jumped from the bedroom.

On his way down, he took a sharp turn to the kitchen where his father, Cornelius, was sipping his coffee and read the newspaper.

\[Hidadloveyoudadbyedad!\] he managed to say, before grabbing the sandwich and leaving the house.

Cornelius replied only with \[Mmm...\] and that was way after his son left.

\[You should put some effort, honey\] his wife scolded him,

\[Mmhmm...\]

\[Oh, for crying out loud...\] she almost shredded the paper with her paw, \[You barely talk with him!\]

\[...I was in the middle of reading...\] despite being Arms General, there were only two things that made him afraid in his life - his mother and his wife, \[I'm sorry...\]

\[You better be! He stays up all night and doesn't want to study! If I hear even once about him failing the grades, you will be sleeping on a couch for a year!\]

The outrageous blackmail. He had to surrender, \[I will go with him on a fishing trip tomorrow\]

\[I hope so!\] the angry mom ended the discussion, \[His troublemaker nature has from you\]

\[And the look after you\]

She turned her back at him. Despite the behavior, her tail flicked a little, \[You're lucky that I love you\]

\[I love you too, dear\]

======

\[Finally! I thought you're in a coma!\]

In front of Keiser's house were Keith's best friends. Also the only friends - Alaric and Vehra. They knew each other since they were kids. If you could name the stereotypes of the trio, it would be:

Alaric the crazy one, Keith the loudest one and Vehra the smartest one.

I think it's not a mystery what exactly was going on between Keith and Alaric, But Vehra? She was often that friend that stopped you from doing something stupid.

\[I told you to not stay up so late\] Vehra added,

\[Jeez, you sound like my mum...\] Keith rolled his eyes,

\[Well, I wouldn't act like that if you weren't such a child!\] she pulled her tongue,

\[I'm literally older than you!\]

\[Alright, alright, you can argue after you marry!\] Alaric got in front of them, \[We're gonna miss it!\]

\[We have time, Nick\] Keith finished his sandwich, \[We have two hours before the Master General will show us his skills\]

\[No cause all the best seats will be taken! Come ooooooooon!\] the crazy one didn't wait for the answer. He just grabbed them both by their sleeves and started running like the demon cheetah possessed him.

They ran through the main street. People were buying and selling stuff, soldiers were patrolling and keeping the peace... It was a good day.

After a while, they arrived to the military school. It happened to be a free day but many students went there for the Master General's show.

\[Come on! Come on!\]

\[See? No one is here!\] Vehra got away from Nickolai's grip,

\[There's someone...\] Keith groaned and pointed at the group of kids in rich clothes and accessories.

\[Is that...?\]

\[Yep... Aster and his gang...\]

Aster's gang was made of noble families. Each one was worse than the other and their leader, Aster, was the rotten cherry on top. Luckily, there were only four of them at that time.

\[We should leave...\] Keith suggested, \[It would be stupid to-\]

He didn't finish. One of the brutes shouted, \[Hey, the princesses are here!\]

Keith hated those insults. He was runt and his body was more feminine than the others. But it hurt Alaric more.

Alaric was their favourite victim. Tail-tucker, abomination, mutant... it cuts deeper than any sword.

Keith always stood up in his defense. But unfortunately, he forgot to take his sword. But he was ready to fight with his own fists for his friends.

And they walked to them, \[You've got lost again\] one of them, Fester shouted, \[It's not the Western shithole!\] The band of bullies laughed from this comedy gold.

\[Don't you have anything better to do?\] Vehra growled back,

\[Oh, you aren't happy to see me?\] Another one, Rod was eyeing Vehra, \[I thought you like me\~\]

Vehra took a step back, disgusted, \[Ngh... I'm gonna throw up...\]

Alaric stood in his friend's defense, \[Can we not fight, just for today?\]

Sentenza, the last thug scoffed at that remark, \[Cowardly as tail-tucker, eh? Should've expected that from you...\]

That was enough for Keith to stand his ground, \[Leave them alone!\] he shouted,

\[Oh-oh, we pissed off the local runt. What are we gonna do?\] their laughs rang in his ears,

\[You will shut your ugly mugs up and then leave\] he tried to sound threatening but it didn't do much.

\[I will say whatever I want, shrimp. Why don't you run back to your whore of a mother like a-\]

A fast left hook straight in the teeth. It was so quick that no one reacted for a moment.

And then, the fight started. For a couple of soldiers, the fight was looking pathetic. Just bunch of teenagers throwing hands and stuff at each other. The fight spread out as more students joined, either from boredom or to stop it.

Keith was separated from his friends and was losing to Aster, \[Not so tough, aren't ya?\] the bully said while pinning him to the wall.

The smaller one managed to grab something next to him. It shatters on Aster's head and caused him to scream in pain. Then Keith punched him again and got away from him.

That's when he saw the fire spreading around the academy. Panic settled in the Basitin as he tried to find a way out.

But then, he saw Aster getting up, bleeding from his head. It was a glass that Keith had.

Before he could say anything, Aster charged at him and pummeled him to the ground again, \[Now I show you how natural selection works, you cunt!\]

\[The fire is spreading!\] Keith shouted, \[We need to get out!\]

\[Oh, you won't get away this time...\] enraged, he didn't care for anything, \[You're a disgrace for the entire Empire! Just fucking die!\]

He began to choke him. This time, Keith couldn't do anything. The pure rage was just too strong. His vision began to blur as his lungs were collapsing...

By pure luck, the support beam fell down along with some of the roof on them. Keith managed to crawl out from the rubble.

Wounded and filled with the smoke, he looked around. The fire was spreading around. He looked down. Aster was unconscious.

\[....damnit...\] he grabbed his bully and dragged him through the floor.

But the door was locked., \[No no no- cough, cough!\] he tried to open it but it didn't budge.

He put Aster down, took a step back and ran into it. Then one more time. After the third hit, the door fell down.

\[It's him!\] someone shouted,

When Keith got up from the cold ground, he looked around. The crowd of soldiers led by Alabaster ran to him and forcefully handcuffed him.

\[W-Wait! What's going on!?\]

\[Shut up!\] the Intelligence General replied in anger, \[Where's Aster?! Where's my son?!\]

\[Sir, we found him!\] a soldier reported to the general while the other escorted the arrested Basitin.

It was complete chaos. Soldiers running around, everyone shouting, firemen fighting with fire, doctors curing the wounded...

And that was the beginning of the nightmare...

======

\[P-Please...\] he cried pathetically, \[I-I didn't do... sniff... d-do anything...\]

It's been two weeks. Two weeks of exhausting and painful interrogation. Each day and night, Keith was questioned over and over and over again...

There was no help. No one was beside him to support him.

He was alone.

The memories were blurry and blended together. Only the most important things stayed intact.

[Interrogation](https://preview.redd.it/v79jd7v6cdve1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f301e5b1d8dcf2657308c5bebc5ad8c077957c00)

Each day was the same. Questioning, beating and threatening...

On the fourteenth day, guards took him to the interrogation room as usual. Alabaster was already waiting there.

\[I-I didn't do it...\] he was so tired, \[P-Please... I want to see my mum...\]

Alabaster didn't say a word. He just gave him the document, \[Read it\]

The document was made of several pages. One name was being repeated several times: Cathleen Keiser.

According to it, his mother was a Westerner, \[N-No... I-It... It's lies!\]

But the general didn't care, \[Once it will come out to light, your family will be destroyed. Your father will lose the position he worked so hard all his life... your mother will have a worse fate. If she's lucky, she will just be banished. If not...\]

It was too much for Keith, \[Stop!\] he shouted, \[Just... Just stop! I-I will do anything just... just stop...\]

The old Basitin smiled. He won.

Courtroom, the same day. He couldn't lift his head; that's how he was weak. He managed to plead guilty on all charges: terrorism, being a Western spy, assassination attempt, arson and couple more that he couldn't remember...

He remembered the silence. No one objected, no one stood in his defense.

He was alone.

[Verdict...](https://preview.redd.it/2kncjmj8cdve1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca441ca3794a205941fe5ca246781bbe0a912565)

When they shoved him on the raft, only soldiers were there to make sure, he won't escape.

He didn't see his friends, he didn't see his father... he didn't see his mother...

He was alone...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Durability That Lasts

When designing your outdoor kitchen, choosing the right countertop material is essential for ensuring long-lasting performance. Granite countertops stand out as one of the most durable options available. This natural stone is resistant to scratches, cracks, and chips, making it ideal for use outdoors where surfaces can be exposed to rough handling and frequent use. Whether you're chopping vegetables or placing heavy cookware, a granite countertop can handle day-to-day wear and tear without losing its appeal.

Because granite is formed under high pressure and temperature deep in the earth, it possesses a strength that synthetic materials simply can't match. This makes it resistant to heat, an important benefit when it’s used next to grills or pizza ovens common in outdoor kitchens. Hot pots and pans won’t damage the surface, which means you can cook and entertain without worry.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/outdoor-kitchen-granite-countertop  
  
### Weather Resistance for Outdoor Spaces

Outdoor kitchens are exposed to all kinds of weather, from direct sunlight to rain and even frost. Granite’s natural composition grants it excellent resistance to weather conditions. It won’t fade under intense sunlight or buckle because of temperature fluctuations. This makes granite countertops a smart investment if you want your outdoor kitchen to stay beautiful and functional throughout the year.

Moreover, granite’s low water absorption rate helps prevent cracks caused by moisture freeze-thaw cycles during colder months. This means you won’t have to worry about costly maintenance or replacing your countertop after harsh winters. Simply sealing your granite countertop annually can help maintain its resistance to moisture and preserve its polished look over time.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/outdoor-kitchen-granite-countertop  
  
### Ease of Maintenance and Cleaning

One of the biggest challenges with outdoor kitchens is keeping surfaces clean from dirt, outdoor debris, and food stains. Granite countertops make this task much easier. Thanks to their dense, non-porous surface when properly sealed, granite does not absorb spills or food particles. This helps prevent the growth of mold, mildew, and bacteria, keeping your cooking environment hygienic and safe for food preparation.

Cleaning granite countertops typically requires just mild soap and water or a granite-specific cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbing, and your countertop will remain shiny and smooth for years. The low-maintenance nature of granite means more time enjoying your outdoor space and less time spent on upkeep.

### Elegant Appearance with Versatile Designs

Granite is prized not only for its toughness but also for its natural beauty. With a wide range of colors, patterns, and finishes available, granite countertops can complement virtually any style of outdoor kitchen—whether modern, rustic, or traditional. The unique veining and specks found in granite slabs add visual interest and luxury to outdoor spaces.

Choosing the perfect granite can enhance the overall aesthetic appeal and increase your home’s value. Options vary from deep blacks and rich browns to lighter tones such as white, cream, and gray. This versatility allows you to customize your outdoor kitchen counter to perfectly suit your personal style and the existing landscape or architectural features of your home.

### Added Value to Your Home

Installing granite countertops in your outdoor kitchen is an investment that pays off beyond just everyday functionality. Granite is seen as a premium material, and its inclusion can boost your property’s resale value. Potential buyers appreciate the quality and durability of natural stone, especially in outdoor entertaining areas where the materials are put to the test by weather and use.

If you plan to sell your home in the future, a well-designed outdoor kitchen featuring granite countertops may set your property apart from others on the market. It signals quality and longevity, which many homeowners seek when evaluating outdoor living spaces.

### Resistance to Stains and Heat

Cooking outdoors often means exposure to oils, sauces, and marinades that can stain surfaces if they are not resilient enough. Granite’s natural resistance to staining, especially when sealed properly, makes it a practical choice. It stands up to the messes created during barbecues and outdoor dining without permanent discoloration.

Heat resistance is another key advantage. Granite can withstand direct contact with hot grilling equipment or pots removed from the fire without warping or burning. This characteristic eliminates the need for additional protection and allows you to place hot items directly on the surface safely.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/outdoor-kitchen-granite-countertop  
  
### Eco-Friendly Choice

If you’re environmentally conscious, you’ll appreciate that granite is a natural stone sourced from the earth without synthetic additives. Compared to manufactured countertop materials, granite has a lower environmental impact over its lifecycle. Many granite providers offer slabs sourced locally or from sustainable quarries, minimizing transportation footprints.

The long lifespan of granite also means less frequent replacement, which reduces waste. By selecting granite, you create an outdoor kitchen that is both beautiful and responsible towards the environment.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/outdoor-kitchen-granite-countertop  
  
### Customization Options for Perfect Fit

Granite slabs can be cut and polished in various shapes and sizes to fit your outdoor kitchen layout precisely. Whether you want a large continuous countertop or multiple sections for different cooking zones, granite’s flexibility in fabrication helps bring your vision to life.

You can choose edge profiles such as beveled or bullnose to add a refined finish, enhancing both safety and style. This level of customization ensures your granite countertop looks professionally integrated and tailored specifically to your outdoor space needs.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/outdoor-kitchen-granite-countertop

Maintenance Tips to Keep Your Outdoor Kitchen Granite Countertop Looking New
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Essential Care for Outdoor Kitchen Granite Countertops

Granite countertops are a popular choice for outdoor kitchens due to their stunning natural appearance and durability. However, outdoor environments expose granite to elements like sunlight, rain, dirt, and temperature changes, which can affect its appearance and lifespan if not properly cared for. You’ll want to follow some straightforward maintenance tips to keep your outdoor kitchen granite countertop looking new for many years.

### Regular Cleaning Routine

Cleaning your granite countertop regularly is the first step to maintaining its natural beauty. You’ll want to use a soft cloth or sponge with warm water mixed with a mild dish soap. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbers, as they can damage the granite’s surface or remove its protective sealant.

- Wipe the surface daily or after cooking to remove food particles, oils, and spills.
- Use a pH-neutral cleaner specifically designed for stone surfaces once a week to maintain shine.
- Rinse thoroughly with water to avoid soap residue buildup, then dry with a clean microfiber cloth.

### Seal Your Granite Properly

One of the most important maintenance tasks is sealing your granite countertop. Sealing helps create a barrier that prevents stains from penetrating the stone and protects it from moisture damage caused by rain or spills.

- Apply a high-quality granite sealer once or twice a year, depending on the manufacturer’s recommendations.
- Perform a simple water test: sprinkle water on the surface; if it beads up, your seal is intact. If water soaks in quickly, it’s time to reseal.
- Make sure the countertop is clean and dry before applying the sealant to ensure proper adhesion.

### Protect Against the Elements

Since your granite countertop is outdoors, protecting it from extreme weather conditions helps preserve its beauty and function.

- Consider covering your countertop with a breathable cover when not in use to shield it from direct sunlight, rain, and falling debris.
- Avoid placing hot pots and pans directly on the granite to prevent thermal shock or discoloration; use trivets or heat pads instead.
- If you live in a region with freezing temperatures, try to keep the countertop dry to prevent cracking caused by ice expansion.
- Trim back nearby foliage to reduce the chance of leaves, dirt, and sap coming into contact with the surface.

### Quick Stain Removal Tips

Despite your best efforts, stains may occur occasionally. Act quickly to prevent permanent damage.

- Blot spills immediately with a paper towel or soft cloth; do not wipe, as this can spread the stain.
- For oil-based stains, apply a poultice made from baking soda and water, cover with plastic wrap, and let it sit for 24 hours before wiping clean.
- Use a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and a few drops of ammonia for organic stains like wine or coffee, but test it on a small area first to ensure it doesn’t affect the stone’s color.

### Additional Tips for Longevity

Little habits can make a big difference over time when caring for your granite countertop.

- Use cutting boards to avoid scratches and maintain the polished surface.
- Place coasters under glasses, especially acidic beverages like citrus juices or sodas, to prevent etching.
- Clean grills and cooking appliances regularly to avoid grease buildup that could drip on the countertop.

Taking these preventive steps ensures your outdoor kitchen granite countertop remains a stunning centerpiece for your backyard gatherings. Remember, simple and consistent care will extend the life of your granite surface, keeping it looking fresh and inviting year after year. With the right maintenance, your granite countertop will continue to combine beauty and durability, making your outdoor cooking and entertaining experience truly enjoyable.

### Conclusion

Choosing granite countertops for your outdoor kitchen brings a blend of beauty, strength, and lasting durability that few other materials can match. With granite’s natural resistance to heat, scratches, and weather conditions, you create a reliable surface perfect for grilling, prepping, and entertaining outdoors. Its timeless appearance adds a touch of elegance that enhances the visual appeal of your entire outdoor space, making your kitchen a welcoming spot for family and friends.

1k192gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameSetup/comments/1k192gk/how_to_clean_a_gaming_chair/,How to clean a gaming chair?,"Jason had been gaming for years, and his trusty gaming chair had been through it all — long hours during weekend raids, late-night solo quests, snack spills, and the occasional coffee mishap. At first, he didn’t think much of the grime building up. But one day, while adjusting his seat during a stream, he noticed just how bad it had gotten. The fabric was stained, the armrests felt sticky, and there was a faint smell he couldn’t ignore anymore.

That weekend, he decided enough was enough. It was time to give the chair a deep clean.

He started by grabbing his vacuum and using the brush attachment to go over every surface — seat, backrest, crevices, and underneath. He was surprised by how many crumbs and dust bunnies had settled into the seams. It already looked better, but he knew he wasn’t done.

His chair was a fabric model, so he had to be careful about what he used. After a bit of online research and scrolling through cleaning tips in forums, he learned that a mix of warm water, mild dish soap, and a microfiber cloth worked best for most fabric chairs. He tested a small patch first, just in case. Once he saw no discoloration, he went ahead and gently scrubbed the entire chair. It took time, but slowly, the stains began to lift.

The armrests, made of PU leather, needed a different approach. Jason used a mix of water and a small amount of white vinegar. He wiped them down thoroughly, then followed up with a damp cloth to remove any leftover residue. The stickiness vanished.

For the base and wheels, he flipped the chair upside down and used a damp cloth to wipe away dust and built-up gunk. The wheels were clogged with hair and carpet fibers, so he used a pair of tweezers and a small screwdriver to dig everything out. It was a bit gross, but he could feel the difference when he spun the chair later.

To finish things off, he sprayed a fabric-safe deodorizer and let the chair air dry completely by a sunny window.

The entire process took a couple of hours, but Jason was shocked by how different the chair felt. It looked almost new, didn’t squeak, and smelled fresh. More importantly, he felt better sitting in it — like he had reclaimed a small but important part of his gaming setup.

From then on, he made it a point to clean the chair every few months. A quick vacuum, a wipe-down, and some wheel maintenance kept things in check. The lesson? A little effort went a long way, and keeping his gear clean made those long gaming sessions even more enjoyable.",1,1744884067.0,GameSetup,0,1.0,False

It started as a local urban legend, the kind of story kids whisper at sleepovers to scare each other. A tall, thin man who moves entirely in reverse—jerky, unnatural, like a video played backward. **The Backward Man.**

The rules were always the same: **if you see him, don’t react. Don’t scream. Don’t run.**  
He only follows those who acknowledge him.

They say he appears in dark alleys, empty parking lots, or the far end of a lonely street just after dusk. You’ll hear a strange, wet clicking sound, like joints popping in the wrong direction, like someone dislocating every bone just to walk.

If you turn to look, you might see him moving toward you, each step perfectly mirrored—his foot landing before he lifts it, his fingers curling open before they clench shut. His face never changes. Slack-jawed. Pale. Eyes milky and unfocused, like he’s watching something else. Maybe a different version of you. Maybe the *before* version.

A friend of a friend swore she saw him once. She was walking her dog late at night. The dog froze mid-step, whined, and backed into her legs. Then she heard it—the sound—like wet bones and broken gears. She turned.

She said he wasn’t just moving backward—he was **undoing**.

There was a stray cat in the alley, freshly dead, hit by a car. She watched as it un-died. Its flattened body peeled up from the pavement, bones unbreaking, fur smoothing. It meowed and ran. But she didn’t move. She remembered the rules.

“He didn’t care,” she said. “He only watches. He only rewinds. Until he notices *you.*”

At the time, I thought it was just a creepy story.

But then came **last night**.

I was walking home from a closing shift. The street was empty. Streetlights buzzed, flickering like dying fireflies. I had my earbuds in—some late-night playlist to keep the tired away. Then, halfway down Wexler Avenue, my music cut out with a *shriek*—like static tearing itself in half.

The air shifted.

It was subtle at first. But wrong.

Everything smelled like burnt hair and wet earth, like something buried deep had been unearthed too soon. My breath fogged even though it was warm. And then I heard it—the sound.

**Click-pop. Click-pop.**  
Wet. Mechanical. Unnatural.

I turned around.  
I don’t know why.  
I *knew* the rules.

He was there.

Taller than I imagined. Dressed in a long, gray coat that fluttered in a wind I couldn’t feel. His arms jerked upward, elbows bending the wrong way, fingers splaying open before clenching into fists.

He moved again.  
A step closer.

The pavement beneath his foot **healed**—a crack sealed itself. A dried leaf reattached to a branch. A burned-out streetlamp above us flickered and glowed again.

I stood still.  
Didn’t breathe.  
Didn’t blink.

He kept coming.  
Another step.  
Another.

I noticed things around me changing. My coffee cup, crushed and tossed in a trash can, was back in my hand, full and warm. A bug I had stepped on earlier scuttled past me, whole and fast. A billboard across the street shifted from an ad I’d seen a week ago to one from months before.

I squeezed my eyes shut. I wanted to scream. To run. But I *remembered.*

Then… silence.

I counted to ten. Twenty. Forty.

When I opened my eyes, he was gone.  
But something was wrong.

At first, I couldn’t place it. My phone buzzed with a message from my mom—**“Please be careful walking home. I had the strangest dream.”** But I’d talked to her earlier. I *remembered.*

Except the call log was empty.

I checked my texts. There were messages I don’t remember sending. One said, **“I saw him.”** Another said, **“I think he’s inside me now.”**

I didn’t write that.

I got home and went straight to the bathroom. My shoes were soaking wet, but it hadn’t rained. My pants had dried mud on them, like I’d walked through a park, or worse. My keys were in the wrong pocket.

Then I looked in the mirror.

My reflection stared back.

But it didn’t move right.

There was a hesitation, like lag. I tilted my head slowly. It followed—but a fraction too late. Like it had to remember how to be *me.*

Then it smiled.

**I didn’t.**

The changes kept coming.

I woke up this morning and my clock was set two hours back. My cereal box had a different design. I checked my emails—half of them were unread, even though I *remember* reading them yesterday. Some were dated last week but I swear they never existed before.

I tried to talk to my roommate. Asked him if anything felt off. He just gave me a look and said,  
“Dude, you moved out two weeks ago.”

No. I live here. I *remember* the layout, the closet full of my stuff. But when I opened it, it was empty.

No clothes. No photos. Nothing with my name on it.

Now, every night, I hear the clicking.

Closer.

Sometimes I catch my reflection watching me when I’m not moving. Like it's waiting. Testing the rules.

And yesterday—God, yesterday—I saw a man across the street, standing still. Just staring.

And *he looked like me.*

But older. Or maybe just… **worn down.**

I think the Backward Man didn’t just rewind me.  
I think he split me.  
Or replaced me.  
Or started something over that was never supposed to be undone.

And now I don’t know if I’m the original…  
or the rerun.",3,1744883812.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

A few years ago, my best friend (let’s call her Ava) went through something that still gives me chills to this day.

In high school, she was super close with a girl (I’ll call her Maya). They were like sisters—always together, sleepovers, matching bracelets, the whole thing. But over time, Maya started acting weirdly possessive. She would get cold or angry whenever Ava talked to guys, and eventually started spreading disgusting rumors about her to ruin her reputation. Things like Ava being “easy” or “mentally unstable.” People believed it, and Ava ended up completely isolated from any kind of romantic attention.

Then college came, and Ava met Rhea—the first person in years who made her genuinely happy. They clicked fast, and it was clear Ava was falling for her. But somehow, Maya found out. And she completely lost it.

She started stalking Ava—showing up at random places, taking pictures from afar, even trying to message Rhea. It got so intense that she followed them on a date once. She claimed it was just a coincidence, but nobody believed that.

One day, Ava went shopping alone, and Maya suddenly appeared. She begged Ava to get coffee with her—“for the sake of old times,” she said. Ava, being too kind, said yes. But once she got in Maya’s car, it became clear this wasn’t about coffee. Maya started driving away, talking about how she just needed to talk, that Ava was hers, that she couldn’t lose her. Ava panicked. She grabbed the steering wheel, and the car crashed.

She was too hurt to move, bleeding and frozen in fear. Maya got out, limping toward her, saying “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. I just want us back.”

That’s when Rhea came running out of nowhere and punched Maya so hard she knocked her out.

Ava and Rhea later sued Maya. She was supposed to be sent to juvie, but her rich parents paid it off. Instead, she got sent to a strict boarding school in Germany, where we later heard she was placed under psychiatric care, given heavy medication, and diagnosed with OCD. Honestly, I think there was more going on than just that.

It still messes with my head. Maya claimed she loved Ava, but love doesn’t stalk, isolate, sabotage, or kidnap. That’s not love—that’s obsession and control.

Ava’s still healing, and she and Rhea are closer than ever now. That punch? Lowkey legendary. But what happened left deep scars. We were just kids. And I think about it more often than I want to admit.

I say ""Brainfog"" because I'm not even sure if it is brainfog, since I've tried potent Lion's Mane capsules & The Buteyko breathing method, and those were of absolute zero use to me.

I've had mild to severe brain fog for about two years now. I was hoping it would fade overtime and was just a strange phase, but it's not. It has affected every possible aspect of my life, as I'm sure people with similar severity can attest to. I used to be able to fill whole conversations with sharp answers, compelling anekdotes and witty humour. This has become impossible for me. It has gotten to the point where I avoid talking to strangers, friends I see when I'm out or going up to talk to a girl, because I know I'm a dull version of myself who can't keep a conversation going for longer than half a minute.

Whenever I have a coffee, I feel slightly less foggy for about 5 minutes, after which it gets a worse again to a point where I can't remember something I said 2 seconds ago without actively trying to remember what is being said to me in that moment. As if my brain is overloaded constantly and won't allow any information to pass in or out.

When I enter a supermarket, a clothing store, or any store that has quite soms impressions, it gets even worse. I just stand there, blank and empty.

It gets a lot worse when I drive, or enter a store of any kind. Causally enjoying a drive, picking out new records or anything similar is absolutely not possible. My focus remains steadily in my empty head, and I cannot shift that focus to the outside world by any attempt.

I have visited my GP for this, but she's the absolute worst. She doesn't listen at all. She prescribed me B12 injections because it was the only shortage of vitamins that showed up on my blood test, and it did absolutely nothing, except for one brief moment for clarity for about 2 minutes, like 30 minutes after the first injection. All the others were useless. I'd switch doctors, but all other GP's in the wide area aren't taking any new patients, which is why I'm stuck with her.

There have been no big, stressful, traumatic or otherwise negative changes in my life since this time. My mother thinks I might be burned out or depressed, and I'm hopefully getting a brain scan when we manage to find an affordable one, since I'm down flat broke as well.

I do suspect I have some form of ADHD since many of my mannerisms correspond with many, if not all, traits, but I tried dexamphetamine, which made my symptoms much worse. I didn't think this would work anyway, since the one major difference in symptoms from me and ADHD folks was that prior to medication, ADHD folks had too many thoughts and busy heads to think straight, while mine feels hollow and empty, but over capacity at the same time. Like nothing else fits, and my brain is on complete lockdown of anything going in or out. Now that I think about it, this is about the best description of this whole thing so far.

I know brainfog isn't as much a disorder as it is a symptom of underlying issues, but I just can't seem to put my finger on how to get my damn head straight, even if just for a a bit.

I have also been tested on sleep apnea, but the test came out negative, though I do snore quite a bit.

I have been working out, meditating, taking vitamins, watching my sleep and diet, but all this has but a limited effect.  I'll keep trying new methods to relieve my head, but this is just busy work. There's probably one major something that's doing this to my brain, and THAT'S the issue I want to find and conquer.

I am beyond desperate to be able to think, focus and memorize freely again as I once used to. Please help me Reddit. Any help is hugely appreciated.",1,1744883518.0,BrainFog,1,1.0,False

Practical Steps on How to Be a Better Wife and Improve Your Marriage
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding the Importance of Effective Communication

One of the most practical steps to enhance your role as a wife and nurture your marriage is mastering effective communication. Open and honest conversations build trust and create a safe space for both partners to express feelings, desires, and concerns. Active listening is just as vital as speaking—when you truly listen, you show respect and validation, which strengthens emotional connection.

Try setting aside distraction-free time daily or weekly to check in with your spouse. Use “I” statements to share your feelings without sounding accusatory. For example, saying “I feel hurt when...” rather than “You always...” can prevent defensiveness and promote understanding.

### Showing Appreciation Regularly

Expressing gratitude for your partner’s efforts can significantly improve your marriage. Everyone wants to feel valued. Small acts of appreciation such as saying thank you, leaving thoughtful notes, or acknowledging their hard work can reignite warmth and positivity between you.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Make it a habit to recognize the little things your spouse does. This habit not only improves your relationship but also encourages your partner to reciprocate appreciation, creating a cycle of mutual respect and love.

### Investing Time in Quality Togetherness

Busy schedules or daily stress can cause couples to drift apart if they do not intentionally spend quality time together. Prioritize activities that both of you enjoy, whether it’s cooking dinner together, taking walks, or planning date nights. These moments help rebuild emotional intimacy.

Creating rituals, like a weekly movie night or morning coffee time, can establish regular bonding that strengthens your marriage foundation. These practices remind both partners of shared joy and remind you why you chose each other.

### Practicing Patience and Understanding

Every marriage faces challenges, but patience can turn these challenges into growth opportunities. Recognize that your spouse has strengths and weaknesses just like you do. Being patient during difficult moments avoids unnecessary conflicts and shows maturity in your relationship.

Try to understand your partner’s perspective, even when you disagree. This empathy encourages compromise and peaceful resolutions. Practicing kindness in communication and actions fosters an environment where both of you can thrive despite imperfections.

### Encouraging Emotional and Personal Growth

Supporting each other’s individual growth is another key step toward strengthening your marriage. Encourage your partner's hobbies, goals, or learning experiences, and seek support for your own too. Healthy marriages flourish when both people have the freedom to grow individually while nurturing their shared bond.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Attend workshops, read relationship books together, or simply discuss personal dreams for the future. Such engagement shows commitment to evolving both as a couple and as individuals.

### Handling Conflicts Constructively

Every couple argues, but it’s how you handle conflicts that determines your relationship’s health. When disagreements arise, focus on resolving problems rather than winning fights. Use calm tones, avoid blaming, and stay focused on the issue at hand.

If emotions escalate, take a short break to cool down before continuing the conversation. Learning conflict resolution skills, such as negotiation and compromise, can transform fights into opportunities for deeper understanding.

### Maintaining Physical Affection and Intimacy

Physical closeness, including hugs, kisses, and cuddling, plays a crucial role in fostering marital happiness. These gestures release bonding hormones like oxytocin, which strengthen your emotional connection.

Acknowledge that intimacy is not just about sex but also about daily physical affection. Simple touches or holding hands can convey love and security, keeping your marriage warm and inviting.

### Balancing Responsibilities and Sharing Household Duties

Sharing daily responsibilities helps prevent resentment and promotes teamwork in marriage. Discuss and divide household chores fairly, considering each other’s schedules and strengths. When both partners contribute, it enhances respect and cooperation within the home.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Support your spouse when they feel overwhelmed and appreciate their efforts. This collaboration eases stress and creates a supportive environment for your family’s well-being.

### Being Mindful of Your Own Wellbeing

Taking care of yourself emotionally, mentally, and physically allows you to bring your best self into the marriage. Practice self-care routines that reduce stress and improve your confidence. When you feel balanced and fulfilled personally, it positively impacts your relationship.

Encourage open discussions about mental health and support each other’s self-care practices. A strong marriage includes two healthy individuals who nurture themselves and each other.

### Building Trust Through Consistency and Honesty

Trust is the bedrock of any lasting marriage. You can build trust by being consistent in your words and actions, and always honoring your promises. Avoid secrecy or dishonesty, as these can quickly erode the foundation of your relationship.

Be transparent about your feelings, concerns, and expectations. When your spouse sees that you are reliable and truthful, it deepens the sense of security and partnership.

### Final Note

Improving your marriage and becoming a better wife takes ongoing effort, patience, and love. By embracing these practical steps—focusing on communication, appreciation, quality time, empathy, growth, conflict management, affection, shared duties, self-care, and trust—you create a resilient and joyful partnership. Remember, small consistent actions often lead to the biggest changes in your relationship over time.

### Understanding the Role of Effective Communication in Marriage

 Communication forms the backbone of any successful marriage. When you learn how to express yourself openly and listen attentively, you create a space where trust and understanding flourish. Becoming a better wife involves nurturing communication habits that encourage honesty and empathy between you and your spouse. Instead of assuming your partner knows your thoughts, actively sharing your feelings helps reduce misunderstandings and build emotional intimacy.

### Practical Ways to Develop Stronger Communication Habits

 Improving the way you communicate begins with small but consistent changes in your daily interactions. Here are some actionable habits you can practice to enhance your relationship:

- **Active Listening:** When your partner speaks, focus fully on them without planning your reply. Reflect back what you hear to show that you understand their point of view. This habit shows respect and validation.
- **Use “I” Statements:** Frame your feelings using “I” rather than “you” to avoid sounding accusatory. For example, say “I feel hurt when…” instead of “You never…” This encourages a more open dialogue.
- **Schedule Regular Check-Ins:** Set aside dedicated time each week to talk about your relationship, goals, or concerns without distractions. This habit keeps communication consistent and prevents issues from piling up.
- **Express Appreciation Often:** Make it a habit to acknowledge your spouse’s efforts and qualities. Positive reinforcement strengthens your connection and motivates continued kindness.
- **Stay Calm During Conflict:** Disagreements are inevitable, but staying calm helps you both think clearly and find solutions. Take breaks if emotions escalate and return to the conversation when you feel balanced.
 
### Building Trust Through Transparent Communication

 Trust grows when you feel safe to share your thoughts and concerns without judgment. Being a better wife means creating an environment where your spouse knows they can rely on your honesty and openness. Transparency about your feelings, needs, and even fears encourages your partner to do the same. Avoid keeping secrets or brushing issues under the rug as these habits can erode trust and intimacy over time.

### Nonverbal Communication and Its Impact

 Words are important, but nonverbal cues like body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice can speak even louder. Paying attention to these signals helps you understand your partner’s true emotions. Simple actions such as maintaining eye contact, offering gentle touches, or mirroring positive facial expressions can deepen your emotional bond without saying a word. Becoming more aware of your own nonverbal communication also prevents misunderstandings.

### Encouraging Vulnerability to Strengthen Your Marriage

 Vulnerability is essential in breaking down emotional barriers. When you let yourself be open and honest about your fears, hopes, and needs, you invite your partner to do the same. This mutual openness fosters a profound connection where both of you feel accepted and loved for who you really are. Practicing vulnerability can be challenging but often leads to the most rewarding moments in your marriage.

### Techniques to Practice Daily for Better Communication

- **Set Intentions:** Before conversations, remind yourself to listen without judgment and speak with kindness.
- **Pause Before Responding:** Take a breath to think about your partner’s words instead of reacting impulsively.
- **Avoid Distractions:** Put away phones and turn off the TV during meaningful conversations to fully engage.
- **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** Encourage deeper dialogue by asking questions that require more than a yes/no answer.
- **Check for Understanding:** Occasionally summarize what your partner said to confirm clarity and reduce miscommunication.
 
### How Building Communication Skills Improves Overall Relationship Health

 When you invest time and energy into improving communication, you lay a strong foundation for your marriage’s longevity. Effective communication reduces conflicts, increases emotional support, and fosters a deeper sense of partnership. This not only brings happiness but also helps you and your spouse navigate life’s challenges together. As you grow better at sharing your feelings and understanding one another, you’ll notice a positive ripple effect into every part of your relationship.

### Remembering That Growth Is a Shared Journey

 It’s important to remember that becoming a better communicator isn’t a solo effort—it takes commitment from both partners. Encourage your spouse to join you in building these habits by being patient and gentle. Celebrate small victories together and keep communication lines open about how you both can improve. When you approach communication as a team, your bond will strengthen and your marriage will thrive.

</div>### Conclusion

Becoming a better wife and improving your marriage starts with small, practical steps that show consistent care and effort. By focusing on actions like actively listening, expressing appreciation, and supporting your partner's dreams, you lay a strong foundation for your relationship. These everyday choices build trust and deepen the bond between you and your spouse.

At the heart of every healthy marriage is communication.

I am the most productive during mornings, but sometimes you need to work or study the whole day. Unfortunately, I always feel way less energetic after lunch and the afternoon slump is rarely convenient. As I know, a lot of us may have similar issues, and even if we really need to be productive, there are days when afternoon slump is really unbearable.

While we may not be able to step away from our responsibilities in the afternoon, there are ways to combat that energy crash. There are some usual ones like getting enough sleep or eating healthy, but let us focus on some less than usual tips if you need to overcome the afternoon slump fast:

My favourite one is to sip caffeine: A cup of coffee or tea can help counter the slump, but timing is key - because mostly all of us want to have a good sleep at night too

Get moving: Even a five- to 10-minute brisk walk or light stretching can boost circulation, oxygen delivery and alertness

Desk yoga: doing some simple yoga stretches at your desk can help you feel more alert.

Put on some music: Certain music can boost your focus, making it easier to get things done—personally for me pop music works the best.

Smell something: Studies suggest that smelling certain scents — like peppermint and rose — can make you feel more alert. I like to dab some essential oils under my wrists and take a whiff.

Chew gum: Some suggest that chewing gum — particularly mint gum — can improve alertness and help you concentrate better.

I have tried all of them and they work rather good for me, so I hope you will find something useful for you too",1,1744883420.0,StudyStruggle,0,1.0,False

1k18vl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1k18vl7/my_uncles_story/,my uncle's story,"This story was told to me by my Fathers Uncle who has been through a lot in his life. The story takes place in the ‘60s in former Yugoslavia, in the east. My uncle’s name was Paul and I will tell this story from his perspective. 

“I grew up in a small city in the east of Yugoslavia, my childhood best friend Marko Jouns, inherited a large farm 60 miles away from our birthplace, after we had served in the army. The farm was in the middle of nowhere, and the closest village was 6 miles away. After he moved there, we haven’t seen each other for 9 years, but we still sent letters back and forth. Two years ago he found a wife, which I unfortunately still have not met, and a year ago she had his first child, her name was Maria. And now, 9 years later I received a letter from him, but he did not sign it, instead it was his wife. The letter said that my dear friend Marko died from falling off a horse, and that I was invited to the funeral. His wife also asked me if I could arrive a day or two earlier, so I could help with some farm work. Which had been neglected after Marko’s sudden and tragic death. I packed a suitcase right away and headed to the farm in my old car. 

It was the end of November, the month was dry, with no rainfall. That day I arrived early at dawn at the Jouns’ farm. His wife was waiting for me with their daughter, with the stableman. I got to know his wife over a warm breakfast. After the introduction, the stableman showed me my duties on the farm. Our first task was to fix the hole in the roof, which we didn’t have time to finish entirely, as there were many more duties on the farm. We were surrounded by a thick forest, and the birds were flying in flocks away from the shots of the hunting rifle. After, I had to feed the cattle, and later to forage for mushrooms in the forest, for our dinner. However, the jobs were prolonged till late in the day, and I fell asleep from exhaustion. I woke up at about 7 in the evening, and apologised to Mrs. Jouns, and the stableman for falling asleep, and said that I will go foraging for mushrooms right now. I took a flashlight and went into the thick forest. The forest was dark, but I wasn’t scared of the dark. I spent my childhood playing in a dark forest, it was totally natural to me. However, because I didn’t know the terrain and the dark I got lost. The howling of the wolves didn’t help me at all, and the fact that a boar ran right in front of me scared me for a second. After about an hour of wandering around in the forest, I ran across a steel fence. After a bit I realised it was a fence of a graveyard. I walked next to it for a bit and found a hole in the fence and went in. Right after I got in, I was staring down a barrel of a shotgun. I froze. The man started questioning me about what I was doing here, and I told him about the Jouns’, Marko’s death and funeral, and how I was helping his wife at their farm. After I told him why I was here, he stared at me for a second and then lowered his gun. He explained to me he was the guard working at the graveyard, and told me to follow him. He led me to a grave and told me to read what it said. After I read what was written, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The blood in my veins froze, and a chill went down my spine. The writing on the headstone read “Mr. and Mrs. Jouns”. The guard told me that Mrs. Jouns died about a year ago at childbirth, and after this Marko left the baby at the next village on someone's doorstep and committed suicide out of grief for his wife. I said that this is impossible, but he insisted and asked me to come to his cabin so he could explain everything. On this eerie night, we drank tea, smoked, and talked about this development. He told me that people who visited this farm never got out. I told him that none of this makes any sense to me. He got out of his old wooden chair, and walked towards the crackling fireplace. With his back turned to me, stood silent for a minute and said: 
-I think that someone moved to that farm after the death of the Jouns’ and that they present as them. The stableman wasn’t the only one living there with them, a maid, cook, and guard were living there too. The cook had coffee with me everyday, but after the tragic deaths, I never saw her again. 
I told him that only the stableman was left, and he asked me if he had long hair and wore glasses. A chill came down my spine and I froze, as the stableman was bald and didn't wear glasses. He looked at me coldblooded, with sorrow and worry in his eyes, and continued. 
-The people there, after the death of the Jouns’ have committed an unimaginable evil, and God knows what they’re doing there. It’s possible that they call old friends of the Jouns’, kidnapping and killing them. 
The guard advised me to stay the night with him, and to call the police in the morning and for me to go home. However, I wanted to go back to the farm to save the baby from those monsters, as I couldn’t let another night go by with the baby's life being in their hands. I asked the guard for a box of matches, said goodbye and left. 

The desire to save the baby defied all my fears and gave me strength to confront the monsters at the farm. I threw all the mushrooms I found, and started gathering dry leaves and chestnuts. 

As I was approaching the farm, I moved in the shadows of the forest and through a cornfield, in which a scarecrow made me fall on my back. I arrived at the farm and went into a barn which housed cattle and horses. I opened the stable doors and let them out. I threw the dry leaves on the ground, and lit them on fire. When the fire grew, I threw the chestnuts in, and started running to the other end of the farm, trying to be as quiet as possible. When chestnuts are thrown into the fire, they start exploding from the high pressure buildup from the inside. When I arrived at the other end of the farm, I started hearing the first sounds of the chestnuts exploding. The loud noises woke up all the animals on the farm, which in panic started to make loud noises and run out of their stables. The horses started galloping and running all around the farm. It didn’t take long for the fake Jouns’ to wake up and run out of the house. I ran to the house immediately to take the baby and the car keys and to run, but they locked the door after they ran out. Then I remembered the hole in the roof. I climbed some bales of hay onto the balcony, then a bullet flew right next to my head. They noticed me and started running back to the house. The fire spread quickly and soon the entire barn was engulfed in flames. I quickly got up to the roof and into the house. I started looking for the baby. When I found the baby on the second floor, they were already in the house. There was no way for me to go down the balcony with the baby, nor to somehow evade them in the house. I hid in the closet on the first floor and waited for them to go up to the second. They ran right past me towards the stairs. I waited for them to go up, when they did I got out of the closet to grab the keys which were on a shelf right next to the stairs. The baby woke up halfway to the shelf and started crying. They heard it. I heard their hastened footsteps coming towards the top of the stairs. I grabbed the keys off the shelf. I heard footsteps coming from the top of the stairs. I looked up and saw the woman staring at me with an axe in her hands. As soon as I saw her I started running towards the exit and could hear her right behind me. The man was nowhere. After getting out of the house, about 30 feet away from me I saw the man with his gun pointed right at me. He fired a shot. I turned my back to protect the baby. The bullet hit a wooden pillar. I got lucky. He was all out of  bullets, but he had a knife. I sprinted to the car and saw the tires were slashed. I had no options. I started running through the dark forest. In the distance I saw headlights. When I got closer it was a familiar face, the guard from the graveyard. I quickly got into the car. In front of us was an unseen sight, half of the farm was in flames, and two maniacs were running toward us with a knife and axe, only their silhouette was visible. The guard quickly turned around and hit the gas. Somehow I managed to escape. 

After an infinitely long night, we went to the police to report everything, they carried out an investigation of the farm. In the house they found letters which the two sent to friends of the Jouns’. They also found something far more sinister, all the buried and burnt bodies, not just them, but also the cook and maid. The two monsters who did this, were never found, no trace, nothing. It was like they never existed. Like they were ghosts.”

Ever felt like your brain was running a marathon while your body just wanted to nap? Yup, I’ve been there. *That* constant mental chatter, juggling a bazillion thoughts, *always* feeling like you’re ‘on’? 🚀

So, I stumbled on this cool little trick—a 2-minute nervous system reset! 🤯 And let me tell you, it’s like giving your brain a soothing cup of chamomile tea every morning. Cozy, right?

**Here’s the Deal:**

Every morning, **before I even touch my phone**, I dedicate 2 minutes solely to my nervous system. 🤗 And guess what? Calmness and focus went from practicing social distancing to BFFs within days!

**Why does it work, you ask?** Turns out, there’s some legit science behind it:

- **Gently Sighing (Yes, you read that right 🤷‍♂️):** Taking two deep breaths, followed by soft sighs, apparently activates your vagus nerve. What’s the vagus nerve? Think of it as the VIP of your parasympathetic nervous system, helping you chill out and *showing stress the door*. 🚪 

- **The Ol’ *Box Breathing*:** Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Rinse and repeat. Navy SEALs swear by it — and if it’s good enough for them, I’m obviously game!

- **Visualizing a Peaceful Place:** Close your eyes and whisk away to anywhere calm—beach, forest, cat café (don’t knock it till you try it!). This isn’t just daydreaming; it’s like giving your mind a tropical getaway without leaving your bed. 🌴

😌 **Results?** Picture this: You throw your focus into laser mode without the jitters from that fourth cup of coffee. Oh, and those pesky daily panic-inducing pings? Suddenly manageable, like you’ve got a zen superpower cape on. 🦸‍♀️ 

**Why Should YOU Try This?**

- **You’ll feel more centered**, and like I said, saying goodbye to that scatter-brain feeling is *the best*. 
- **No special tools needed**—just a will to embrace a slightly calmer future You.
- **Stress? What’s that?** Seriously, it’s almost like stress forgot my address.

Honestly, I never thought just 2 minutes could treat me this well. But, here we are, and I’m stoked to keep it up. So, if you’re feeling like you need a daily mellow moment, why not give it a whirl?

Would love to know if any of you have quirky morning rituals for keeping that cool, cucumber vibe. Let’s hear ‘em!

1k18prp,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1k18prp/hit_by_another_wave_of_depression/,Hit By Another Wave of Depression,"This morning has been rough. I’m exhausted from the same mundane routine—week after week, the same job, the same long commute, the same thoughts weighing me down. I took this desk job because it paid significantly more than my previous one, but I’ve realized that money alone isn’t enough to make me feel fulfilled. I’ve always preferred physical work, but financial obligations, debt, and responsibility forced me into this path.

Lately, I’ve been feeling depressed, lonely, and overwhelmed with anxiety. It’s hard to escape the lingering thoughts that follow me throughout the day. I saw someone post about how, if it weren’t for their loved ones, they wouldn’t still be here—and that resonated with me in a way that worries me. My life isn’t what I wanted it to be. I dreamed of traveling the world, but I can’t afford it. I want to go back to school and change my career, but that feels impossible. I’d love to quit my job and start fresh, but my financial situation makes that seem like a distant dream.

Even interactions feel hollow. I had a conversation this morning that just felt fake, like people say they care because it’s what they’re supposed to say, not because they actually mean it. Aside from a few close people, it feels like no one truly sees me.

And then there’s the world around me—so many major events unfolding, real struggles, deep crises, and yet people still complain about the most minor inconveniences. Sometimes, it makes me wonder if they truly realize how much suffering is out there, how much pain exists beyond a slow Wi-Fi connection or a wrong coffee order. It’s frustrating to feel this disconnected while others seem so unaware of the bigger picture.

I don’t know what comes next, but I do know this—this isn’t the life I wanted, and I don’t want to stay stuck in it.",1,1744882496.0,depression,0,1.0,False

The trip will involve sailing and hiking and ideally I also want to shoot some northern lights. I wanted to just roll with my current equipment and see how it goes. But then again, this trip is quiet expensive and not sure I will do something like it anytime soon again! This brings me to the following question; should I add some new lenses, perhaps even a different body for my needs?

My gear:  
\- R6 MK i (20mpx)  
\- RF 15-15mm 2.8  
\- RF 50mm 1.2  
\- RF 85mm 1.2

Here is the part, thats been bugging me, I would love to PRINT some of the shots I take up there, but also in general. Doing some research I found out that, for reasonably sized wall prints, it is better to have more pixel density (who would have thought). Of course, there are methods to upscale images with AI etc.. but how good are they and will I notice something in my wall prints, if I were to use my R6 and upscale in post processing or should I really consider getting a second body, R5 or R5 mk ii?

Last but not least, I would love to shoot some wildlife, birds, whales.. and PERHAPS we would even be able to spot Polar Bears. For that, even though my lens kit is pretty good, I fear that I am not equipped good enough. I.e. I am missing the super zoom/telephoto lens. I have been eyeing the 70-200 with a teleconverter as a single ""allrounder"" lens for that trip in particular, but the lens alone is 3k. So I feel hesitant and would love to know the opinion of the community on how to navigate my preparation for the trip.

  
Also; I need to be sensible with resp. to portability and weight. For instance, I am not allowed to bring a whole lot of gear onto the sailing yacht. So packing 3x RF lenses vs. 1x or perhaps 2x would make a difference.",1,1744882493.0,canon,5,1.0,False
1k18pkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1k18pkk/too_much_protein_meds_less_effective/,"Too much protein, meds less effective?","Hi all, I always see posts about how important it is to ensure protein intake with Elvanse; which was something my prescribing/managing team also suggested. 

I am vegetarian and ‘fussy eater’ so also don’t eats eggs, yogurts and many more. I rely on supplementing protein, aside from cheese/nuts/meat alternatives/pulses in my diet

Recently, I have changed my breakfast from a crumpet to a bar/brownie/flapjack containing 20-25g protein just before taking my Elvanse. Then I have clear whey (20g protein) drink which I have alongside water/decaf coffee throughout the morning- I have always had this drunk since being on Elvanse. 

I changed my routine to see if it would give me a longer effect from Elvanse which I feel often runs out around 1-2pm, meaning on busy days (more often than not in my work life) I may take dex in early afternoon.  

Since adding this protein bar, it feels like the medication has actually been less effective. I have been taking ages to complete tasks that I wouldn’t normally. Could the protein be having a negative effect? Any other advice, I will asleep ask my team but lived experiences are often more helpful. 

Ps: there is a chance I am a bit under the weather as viral illnesses are going round, so this could also be a factor….maybe I should give it a bit longer to assess.

Hope this is the right sub for this, please redirect if not. UK Based

TLDR: Can the Magnifica start reach the same coffee temperature of the S? 

Planning on buying my first machine- trying to decide between the Magnifica S (ECAM22.110.B) Vs Start (ECAM220.22.GB). I know they both have the features I need- I probably have a long coffee of sorts most often and I can't work out if the Start will reach a good temperature. I definitely like a hot coffee as much as it doesn't impact taste. A friend has an S and I know that machine reaches adequate temperature - just wondering if anyone has experience and can comment if the Start gets hot enough by comparison or less so? I know both are temperature adjustable but can't tell if they're both adjustable to the same extent

O que foi atualizado (algumas coisas eu já tinha incluido antes):
- Valores (fui atrás de fornecedores com valores mais baixos)
- Shopee (acrescentei opção de compra pela Shopee em alguns itens que achei mais barato, já que ultimamente é onde estão mais baratas as coisas)
- Se eu deixei só um link, provavelmente é onde está mais barato no momento. Se tem mais de um é porque está oscilando ou são muito próximos (dai clica nos dois e vê qual sai mais em conta)
- Adição de **novos itens** e **novas categorias** (máquina de espresso, moedores elétricos, livros, decorações, presenteáveis, etc)


Segue abaixo a reprodução do post (o que está fixado também já está atualizado com os novos itens!)

Pra cada categoria eu selecionei os itens com mais recomendações seguindo os seguintes critérios **dos últimos 6 meses**:


- Número de indicações no sub: quantas pessoas indicaram aquela marca; e
- Número de upvotes: quantas pessoas deram upvote naquele comentário/post de indicação


Enfim, embora a preferência por marca de máquina, utensílio ou café possa ser **subjetiva**, eu quis trazer pra cá o trabalho que muitos teriam quando chegam no sub: ficar garimpando nos posts as recomendações


Além disso, junto com cada recomendação, eu incluí o comentário mais relevante sobre aquele produto pra que seja mais fácil entender porque os membros recomendaram ele. Além disso, estarão do lado os links da Amazon e do AliExpress do respectivo produto (com o valor mais barato que eu encontrei no momento em que fiz o post)


**Haverá também mais de uma recomendação em cada categoria, sendo que o mais recomendado terá um emoji (⭐) pra sinalizar**


⚠️ Esta é uma lista **em construção** e conto com os comentários de vocês para mudar, retirar ou adicionar algo na lista. Se você não concorda com algum item, exponha sua opinião e se os demais membros concordarem, alterarei sem problemas

i don't know where to start, because even i don't know where did i start losing myself. it started long before this, quietly like a loose thread of a sweater slowly pulling apart. i keep damaging myself and i don't know who to recover or move forward. my life is stood still. everything around me comes and goes and i stand there like this sweater slowing being pulled apart.

on 13th of april I was asleep, and my mom shook me awake and said, ""Wake up, I think Sultan is dead."" I woke up in shock. half asleep, I ran to the room, where I saw him lifeless, drooling, with one eye open. And all I could do was think was why I slept. If I hadn't slept, I could have rushed him to the vet been with him in his last moments made him comfortable. But the truth is by that point, he died alone and i didn't matter anymore anymore because all i was left with was guilt.

Let me take you back to when my cats were born. When my babies were born. on the 8th of February. something that was supposed to be beautiful memory. I couldn't be as happy for them as I wanted to, because four days prior to that, the love of my life left me. She abandoned me. And even though my cat giving birth was a beautiful thing, I couldn’t feel the joy I was supposed to. I couldn’t even smile properly. The grief was too loud. 2 days later the mother cat stopped feeding them so I stepped in. with milk replacers

I hand fed them every two hours, around the clock It kept me busy. And diverted my mind from my thoughts because I had to feed them every two hours. I stayed awake every night, all night long, just feeding them. In the day, I was asleep but waking up every two hours to feed them and also had to wake up five times a day to pray. I was maybe getting 3-4 hours of sleep a day at best . I was getting exhausted. Mentally, I was just getting messed up. I was losing myself. It wasn’t just the exhaustion. It was something deeper. I was losing my grip on reality.

It wasn’t just about the cats. If anything, my cats helped me. They were like my companions. I felt happy around them. I felt… I felt great around them. I still do. It's just the fact that being in the situation that I was, I was just losing myself. I was disconnecting from reality. I was so busy doing stuff (other than my cats) doing stuff that doesn’t matter. Chores. Spending hours on them. My life felt like it had stopped. I was already fading already drowning in failures, and this huge pause in my life stretched longer than it should have. Life wasn’t moving forward. It was just… sitting still. anyways slowly, the kittens started to grow. We named them Archie, Sultan, and Einstein ( called him Einie or Einnu for short ). I named them this because of one of my favorite movies, Back to the Future. I loved the name Einstein.

After that, days passed. I fed them every day. I played with them every day. They loved me, and I loved them. And it felt relieving seeing them bite my hands. They would be in the other room, and I would be asleep. My mom would open the door and they would all run to my room. Sultan would bite my hair and kick my head. He was the biggest, the healthiest. And I felt really nice. They made me feel nice. They made me feel better about my life. i felt part of a family maybe the reason i felt that is cause i'm an only child idk maybe.

But life has a cruel habit of reminding you how fragile happiness is i think all happiness, carries within it the seed of its own ending from the moment it comes into existense and just like that one day, Sultan’s tummy got upset. I gave him some Flagyl. And he was active, playing, running. Everything was great. The next morning, it got worse, so I took him to the vet. first thing when it opened cause i didn't sleep the night so i just waited for the clinic to open. He was still active at this point. The vet gave an injection for his fever, and one for his tummy.

I came home.  i was with him for an hour he pooped a few times all were the upset ones but i thought the meds would kick in soon so I just thought I would sleep for a little while. And i closed my eyes the next thing i know i mom said wake up I think Sultan is dead. He’s not breathing.” I woke up in shock and ran to the other room, where I saw the result of my negligence. Still. Cold. and lifeless there was nothing I could do anymore but hold the regret of sleeping, only if i didn't sleep i would have been able to do something take it to the vet when he was near his end or maybe i could have just been with him comforting him in his final hours but he was gone....

We took him to the nearest park, where I buried him. I came home… and he was just not there anymore. He passed on the 2nd of April. After Sultan, every morning felt like punishment and I didn’t know how to break free from it, whenever I would wake up with an intense heartbeat and it would feel like he was still here, and it was a dream. But it wasn’t. My baby was actually gone. and every time my mom shook me awake for breakfast, for anything I panicked. And everytime I'd think another one was gone. It became a reflex. more like a curse and i remember this happening when she left everyday id wake up with a really fast heart beat for a second feel like it was just a bad dream and check my phone and relive the fact that she really did abandon me.

And then, exactly on the 9th of April, Einie and Archie both got their tummies upset and passed blood in their stool. I took them to the vet immediately. He said… he said it was most probably FPV. i was for the second time in my life afraid. the mortality rate of this virus was 90% and this is what sultan had. And you all must be wondering right now why didn’t I get them vaccinated? Well, it was because, firstly, I raised them myself. They were way smaller for their age because of not being on their mothers milk secondly i had just gotten them dewormed and third they were always a little bit sick and the vet said you can do their vaccination once they are healthy.” Because they would get sick here and there. But it’s on me. It’s my fault. I should have gotten them vaccinated whenever they felt the healthiest they would still be with me.

Anyways, We started it. It was fucking expensive. But I didn’t care. I just wanted my babies to be okay. We started treatment. Antibiotics. Drips. Vitamins. We even used blood from their father to create antibody serum. I read about the virus and I followed everything. I poured everything into saving them. I did everything by the book for their best chance of survival however my baby Einie kept losing weight. He kept losing himself. I stayed with him in the room the entire night. i never left his side. His situation was getting worse day by day. He kept vomiting, and I was just there, cleaning it, comforting him to the best of my ability

And I observed and learned that presence, even in silence, carries a great amount of weight. Even cats can feel  the presence... I would leave the room, and he would vomit more. He would run around. Even though his mom and his brother were there. His mom was there because she was vaccinated, but her tummy was upset so I didn’t want to expose her to the dad. So she stayed in this room. however, when I stayed with Einie, he would vomit less. He would be calm. He would look at me occasionally. And he would just… be Einie. The little cutie pie that he was my baby Einie

We then shifted him to drips. Three drips a day. He couldn’t eat or drink. He was losing himself. And I… was doing everything I could for him. every drip, every injection, every moment he shut his eyes, every scream, every cry, I was there but it wasn't enough....Now… I’ll bring myself to the last 48-72 hours I had with him.  I didn’t sleep for a single second. I was with him the entire way When he slept I really wanted him to live. Because he was so loving. And I really loved him. I really loved him. I really loved him.

It broke me one day. It was 4 AM and Einie lost response to touch. I rushed him to the vet the same vet who was doing his treatment. I made them their clinic as they weren't a 24 hour service i called and called until he picked up and i made him come to the clinic and here’s what broke me. Whatever I was telling him, he was on his phone. I had a suspicion of what he was doing. And then I saw it. The vet… wasn’t even trying. He was typing what I said into ChatGPT. Asking it how to save my boy as if i couldn't do that myself. all he did was copy paste my desperation... for a while i regretted ever bringing him to this vet but then again life and death is in gods hands not ours. he was at the point where i knew he would pass and i didn't have any money left to change the vet I had spent everything I had on these treatments. Every last penny. Every favor. Every drop of hope. That day, we got his medication done. I got home. I knew he probably wouldn’t make it through the night. I stayed. I stayed with him the entire night. He made it. The next day I got his drips. I got everything done.

I came back home. His breathing pattern changed. It felt like i was losing him, I was there cleaning every time he did peeopee or poopoo because he lost his urinary control and everything. He was slowly becoming a mess. I kept cleaning. And I was with him. somehow he made it through the night. And the next day I took him and his brother for the treatment. We got them drips, meds, everything. I came back. I cleaned him over and over. until i could not humanly keep my eyes open. ( i don't drink coffee or energy drinks ) And then I just slept a little, because I hadn’t slept in over 2 days

And as soon as I slept I shouldn’t have, but I did my mom told me to wake up. “He’s not responding anymore.” She woke me up and before she even said anything, I was halfway across the room to him. I saw he was drenched in his own peepee and poopoo because he didn’t have control anymore. And i wasn't their to clean him and the dignity sheet under him when tho absorbed some of his mess it got on him. I told ChatGPT all his conditions. ChatGPT said these are his final moments. And I refused to believe that. I said, “No, ChatGPT, no. Please tell me what to do to save him. Because I didn’t want to lose Einie he was my baby he was so loving. He slept with me. He played with me. He loved me. I loved him. I just didn’t want to let him go. i didn't want him to give up. he was at the end getting colder and colder

But he was suffering. He was suffering every time I took him to the vet. He was suffering so much. And it hurt me. It hurt me every time I saw him suffer, i wish i fucking wish i could take all his pain away i would a million times over. I prayed. And I prayed. And I kept praying. And I just asked ChatGPT to help me. It said, dry him first of all. Get him heat. get his body temp up  Get him an electrolyte solution. I ran to my kitchen. I took a pan thingy. Then I kept some water on to boil so I could pour it into that bottle and keep it under him. But until it boiled, I was just getting anxious so i asked chat gbt and took him upstairs into the sunlight not direct, indirect sunlight. I ran back down. I took a pair of scissors and a towel. I dried him. I cut all the hair that had poop in it to make him comfortable. I ran back down. I made an electrolyte solution using honey and a pinch of salt. I ran back up. And I gave it slowly, putting one drop at a time on his gum. At first, he wasn’t swallowing—but slowly, once every while, he was. So, when he swallowed it, it gave me just a tiny pinch of hope. And I held on to that.

I ran downstairs and I fell down hit my head broke my glasses but it didn’t feel painful. It felt like nothing. All I could think about was Einie. writing this i look and sound stupid but i just want to say it, I took him downstairs. I poured the hot water in the flask well not the flask, the water bottles, you know the water bottles that are for heating purposes. And then I kept giving him water. I kept cleaning him. At this point, I couldn’t even keep my eyes open not even for a bit. But I stayed up as long as I could. My body was giving out, but I stayed up cleaning him, giving him a few drops of the solution and i kepy talking to my baby telling him ""hey its gonna be okey dont you worry. you will be okey in no time and when you are we will play ill give u so many treats we will get you so many toys we will go on rides and we are gonna annoy everyone. i ekpt talking to him the entire day.

And then I could no longer stay awake. So I slept right beside him, with my finger in his paw. He was breathing really really fast. And I woke up every 10 to 15 minutes and gave him the electrolyte solution and i kept talking to him. I did this for hours. Until I woke up… and I was the only one that woke up. And there I was, looking at my baby Einie, lying there lifeless. He didn’t even make a sound before going. And all I could feel was guilt. Guilt for the pain and suffering I caused him. Every time he got an injection. Every time he screamed. Every time he cried every vomit every ounce of pain. All of that guilt it just flooded in. That I did all this. I caused him all this suffering. Just for my own selfish wants. so many, so many feelings came rushing in. And I just couldn’t take it, so I cried. I know a man isn’t supposed to feel this whatever tf i was feeling But maybe I am pathetic. But I did cry. And I felt… I felt alone. I felt vulnerable. I felt off. I felt rotten.

And… I cleaned my tears before my mom got here. I took him to the same park as Sultan, where I buried my baby einie too and then… I felt… alone. Even though this wasn’t even long. I was with these kittens for less than 2 months, and I felt like I had known them for a lifetime. And I loved them. And I would have done anything for them to make them happy. But they’re gone now.

After that, I changed the vet. The new vet isn’t as expensive as the last one, because I used up a lot of money for Einie and Archie together. But even though this vet isn’t as expensive, he feels just as qualified. We’re doing everything by the book to save Archie. He’s battling FPV as i write this. He hasn’t lost any weight, but he hasn’t gained any either. And now I’ll help him fight this battle And I hope he makes it. Because I love my cats. And I don’t have anything going on in my life right now… except my cats. even if i did my cats are my family and for once in my life i don't want to lose i want want them to leave.

I hope Archie lives. All I can do now is pray.

when i die i want to get reunited with my friends my baby einie and sultan

If you’re reading this and got this far… can you guys please pray for the health of my cats

Thank you everyone have great lives

He hasn’t lost any weight, but he hasn’t gained any either. And now I’ll help him fight this battle And I hope he makes it. Because I love my cats. And I don’t have anything going on in my life right now… except my cats. even if i did my cats are my family and for once in my life i don't want to lose i want want them to leave.

I hope Archie lives. All I can do now is pray.

when i die i want to get reunited with my friends my baby einie and sultan

If you’re reading this and got this far… can you guys please pray for the health of my cats

Thank you everyone have great lives

I have always seen her taking pics in the mirror, getting distracted by checking herself out, and always objectifying herself.

She is also concerned about how I look and act, but that's not what's important. 

Even if she claims she is broke and whatever, she will be dripped with brand clothing. She has always been so materalistic and judgemental, but aleays claims she has ""positive"" energy ehich attracts people to her. 

We went to a coffee shop and at first it was empty. A lot of people gathered after we came, and she started explaining how her aura brings people.

lol

She also has been objectifying herself so much more lately, and I do think it's for male attention.

She has been dressing a bit openly. For example, I caught her at 1 am taking pics in a tube top and shorts. I have never seen her wear that combo, so it was a bit odd to me.

She dresses how I should be dressing for my age, but it seems like she has been in a mid-life crisis for years and years now.

I'm just curious if other people deal with this too...as I have only seen topics of mothers focusing on their kid's looks.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection process for the best 24 oz cups involved a comprehensive evaluation of several key features. These features are crucial in determining the overall performance and user satisfaction of each cup. We tested and analyzed each cup based on its ability to maintain temperature, its durability in various conditions, its ease of cleaning, and its overall design.

**Insulation Performance:** The insulation performance of a 24 oz cup is paramount, especially for those who enjoy hot or cold beverages on the go. We rigorously tested each cup's ability to maintain temperature over extended periods. Specifically, we measured how long each cup could keep liquids hot (above 140掳F) and cold (below 40掳F) under controlled room temperature conditions. The top performers utilized double-walled vacuum insulation technology, which significantly minimized heat transfer.

**Durability and Material Quality:** The durability of a 24 oz cup is critical, particularly for those who use it daily or take it on outdoor adventures. We assessed each cup's resistance to dents, scratches, and cracks by subjecting them to drop tests and simulated wear and tear. Cups made from high-quality stainless steel and BPA-free Tritan plastic proved to be the most durable. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the lids and seals to ensure they were leak-proof and long-lasting.

**Leak-Proof Design and Lid Functionality:** A leak-proof design is essential for any portable cup. We evaluated the effectiveness of each cup's lid and sealing mechanism by filling them with liquid and subjecting them to various movements, including shaking and tilting. The best cups featured secure, screw-on lids with silicone gaskets that created a tight seal. We also considered the functionality of the lid, such as whether it had a convenient drinking spout or straw compatibility.

**Ease of Cleaning:** The ease of cleaning is a significant factor for daily use. We assessed how easy it was to disassemble and clean each cup, both by hand and in a dishwasher. Cups with smooth, non-porous surfaces and minimal crevices were the easiest to clean. Dishwasher-safe components were also a plus, as they simplified the cleaning process. We also considered how resistant the cups were to stains and odors.

**Ergonomics and Comfort:** The overall comfort and ergonomics of a 24 oz cup play a crucial role in the user experience. We assessed how comfortable each cup was to hold, carry, and drink from. Features such as a textured grip, a comfortable mouth opening, and a balanced weight distribution contributed to a more enjoyable experience. Cups that were too bulky or had awkward shapes were less comfortable to use.

 ## Core Benefits

The best 24 oz cups offer several key benefits that cater to a wide range of needs. These benefits include improved hydration, temperature retention, and environmental friendliness. The right cup can make a significant difference in your daily routine, offering convenience and promoting a healthier lifestyle.

**Enhanced Hydration:** Owning a reliable 24 oz cup encourages increased water consumption throughout the day. By having a readily available and appealing container, users are more likely to stay hydrated. This can lead to improved energy levels, better skin health, and enhanced overall well-being. A 24 oz cup provides a tangible goal for daily water intake, making it easier to track and achieve hydration targets.

**Superior Temperature Retention:** High-quality 24 oz cups, particularly those with vacuum insulation, excel at maintaining the temperature of both hot and cold beverages. This means you can enjoy your coffee hot for hours or keep your water refreshingly cold even on a warm day. This is especially beneficial for individuals who are constantly on the go or who work in environments where temperature fluctuations are common.

**Eco-Friendly Alternative to Single-Use Plastics:** By using a reusable 24 oz cup, you can significantly reduce your reliance on single-use plastic cups. This contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle and helps minimize plastic waste in landfills and oceans. Choosing a durable and long-lasting cup ensures that you are making a conscious effort to protect the environment.

**Cost Savings Over Time:** While the initial investment in a high-quality 24 oz cup may be higher than purchasing disposable cups, the long-term cost savings are substantial. Over time, you will save money by not having to purchase disposable cups on a regular basis. This makes a reusable cup a financially sound investment in addition to being an environmentally responsible choice.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have specific questions about 24 oz cups before making a purchase. Here are some common questions and their answers to help guide your decision. These questions address concerns about compatibility, cleaning, and material safety.

**Are 24 oz cups dishwasher safe?**
  It depends on the specific cup. Many stainless steel and BPA-free plastic 24 oz cups are dishwasher safe, but it's essential to check the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, the body of the cup is dishwasher safe, while the lid may require hand washing to prevent damage to the sealing components.

**Are all 24 oz cups BPA-free?**
  No, not all 24 oz cups are BPA-free, especially older models or those made from cheaper materials. However, most reputable brands now prioritize using BPA-free materials, such as Tritan plastic or stainless steel. Always check the product specifications or labeling to ensure the cup is BPA-free.

**How long can a 24 oz insulated cup keep drinks cold or hot?**
  The duration depends on the insulation technology and the ambient temperature. High-quality vacuum-insulated 24 oz cups can typically keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours. Factors such as how often the cup is opened and the initial temperature of the beverage can also affect the temperature retention time.

**Can I use a 24 oz stainless steel cup for acidic drinks like lemon water or fruit juice?**
  Yes, you can use a 24 oz stainless steel cup for acidic drinks. High-quality stainless steel, such as 18/8 or 304 stainless steel, is resistant to corrosion and won't react with acidic beverages. However, it's still advisable to clean the cup thoroughly after each use to prevent any potential staining or buildup.

No, I don’t want to talk about it.","For those of you blissfully unaware, the DMS-10 is a digital voice switch designed back when disco was still alive and engineers thought 19-inch racks were a sexy use of space. Nortel launched this beast in the 70s, deployed it hard in the 80s, and somehow—somehow—we still have a few of them clunking along in rural telco like they aren’t actual museum pieces.


What does it do?

TDM voice switching.

No SIP. No VoIP. No LNP.

Just pure, 1970s-style circuit-switched stubbornness.


It routes calls like your granddad fixed a carburetor—with grit, duct tape, and zero interest in your modern sensibilities.


Does it support local number portability?
Absolutely not.

If a number ports in and you don’t manually update the routing table over a serial connection, it’ll just blackhole that call into a non-Euclidean dimension. Seriously—RS232, hand-typed, one line at a time, while praying the terminal emulator doesn’t freak out.

And here’s the kicker:

This thing sucks down more power than a rack of modern gear combined—even if it’s just routing one sad little call.

Want to send a simple “Hello”?

Great. The DMS-10 will spin up the equivalent of a space heater to make it happen.

It’s like driving a dump truck to deliver a sandwich.


So yeah, we’ve got triple-redundant fiber paths, VoIP core routers with failover, and OpenSearch dashboards showing me microsecond stats—but out in Pop #3?


We’ve got a DMS-10 eating 1200 watts to switch a 64kb call.


Don’t ask me why it’s still live.

Don’t ask me how it hasn’t burst into flames.

And definitely don’t ask me to update its routes before I’ve had coffee.

 i don't know where to start, because even i don't know where did i start losing myself. it started long before this, quietly like a loose thread of a sweater slowly pulling apart. i keep damaging myself and i don't know who to recover or move forward. my life is stood still. everything around me comes and goes and i stand there like this sweater slowing being pulled apart.



on 13th of april I was asleep, and my mom shook me awake and said, ""Wake up, I think Sultan is dead."" I woke up in shock. half asleep, I ran to the room, where I saw him lifeless, drooling, with one eye open. And all I could do was think was why I slept. If I hadn't slept, I could have rushed him to the vet been with him in his last moments made him comfortable. But the truth is by that point, he died alone and i didn't matter anymore anymore because all i was left with was guilt.



Let me take you back to when my cats were born. When my babies were born. on the 8th of February. something that was supposed to be beautiful memory. I couldn't be as happy for them as I wanted to, because four days prior to that, the love of my life left me. She abandoned me. And even though my cat giving birth was a beautiful thing, I couldn’t feel the joy I was supposed to. I couldn’t even smile properly. The grief was too loud. 2 days later the mother cat stopped feeding them so I stepped in. with milk replacers



I hand fed them every two hours, around the clock It kept me busy. And diverted my mind from my thoughts because I had to feed them every two hours. I stayed awake every night, all night long, just feeding them. In the day, I was asleep but waking up every two hours to feed them and also had to wake up five times a day to pray. I was maybe getting 3-4 hours of sleep a day at best . I was getting exhausted. Mentally, I was just getting messed up. I was losing myself. It wasn’t just the exhaustion. It was something deeper. I was losing my grip on reality.



It wasn’t just about the cats. If anything, my cats helped me. They were like my companions. I felt happy around them. I felt… I felt great around them. I still do. It's just the fact that being in the situation that I was, I was just losing myself. I was disconnecting from reality. I was so busy doing stuff (other than my cats) doing stuff that doesn’t matter. Chores. Spending hours on them. My life felt like it had stopped. I was already fading already drowning in failures, and this huge pause in my life stretched longer than it should have. Life wasn’t moving forward. It was just… sitting still. anyways slowly, the kittens started to grow. We named them Archie, Sultan, and Einstein ( called him Einie or Einnu for short ). I named them this because of one of my favorite movies, Back to the Future. I loved the name Einstein.



After that, days passed. I fed them every day. I played with them every day. They loved me, and I loved them. And it felt relieving seeing them bite my hands. They would be in the other room, and I would be asleep. My mom would open the door and they would all run to my room. Sultan would bite my hair and kick my head. He was the biggest, the healthiest. And I felt really nice. They made me feel nice. They made me feel better about my life. i felt part of a family maybe the reason i felt that is cause i'm an only child idk maybe.



But life has a cruel habit of reminding you how fragile happiness is i think all happiness, carries within it the seed of its own ending from the moment it comes into existense and just like that one day, Sultan’s tummy got upset. I gave him some Flagyl. And he was active, playing, running. Everything was great. The next morning, it got worse, so I took him to the vet. first thing when it opened cause i didn't sleep the night so i just waited for the clinic to open. He was still active at this point. The vet gave an injection for his fever, and one for his tummy.



I came home.  i was with him for an hour he pooped a few times all were the upset ones but i thought the meds would kick in soon so I just thought I would sleep for a little while. And i closed my eyes the next thing i know i mom said wake up I think Sultan is dead. He’s not breathing.” I woke up in shock and ran to the other room, where I saw the result of my negligence. Still. Cold. and lifeless there was nothing I could do anymore but hold the regret of sleeping, only if i didn't sleep i would have been able to do something take it to the vet when he was near his end or maybe i could have just been with him comforting him in his final hours but he was gone....



We took him to the nearest park, where I buried him. I came home… and he was just not there anymore. He passed on the 2nd of April. After Sultan, every morning felt like punishment and I didn’t know how to break free from it, whenever I would wake up with an intense heartbeat and it would feel like he was still here, and it was a dream. But it wasn’t. My baby was actually gone. and every time my mom shook me awake for breakfast, for anything I panicked. And everytime I'd think another one was gone. It became a reflex. more like a curse and i remember this happening when she left everyday id wake up with a really fast heart beat for a second feel like it was just a bad dream and check my phone and relive the fact that she really did abandon me.



And then, exactly on the 9th of April, Einie and Archie both got their tummies upset and passed blood in their stool. I took them to the vet immediately. He said… he said it was most probably FPV. i was for the second time in my life afraid. the mortality rate of this virus was 90% and this is what sultan had. And you all must be wondering right now why didn’t I get them vaccinated? Well, it was because, firstly, I raised them myself. They were way smaller for their age because of not being on their mothers milk secondly i had just gotten them dewormed and third they were always a little bit sick and the vet said you can do their vaccination once they are healthy.” Because they would get sick here and there. But it’s on me. It’s my fault. I should have gotten them vaccinated whenever they felt the healthiest they would still be with me.



Anyways, We started it. It was fucking expensive. But I didn’t care. I just wanted my babies to be okay. We started treatment. Antibiotics. Drips. Vitamins. We even used blood from their father to create antibody serum. I read about the virus and I followed everything. I poured everything into saving them. I did everything by the book for their best chance of survival however my baby Einie kept losing weight. He kept losing himself. I stayed with him in the room the entire night. i never left his side. His situation was getting worse day by day. He kept vomiting, and I was just there, cleaning it, comforting him to the best of my ability



And I observed and learned that presence, even in silence, carries a great amount of weight. Even cats can feel  the presence... I would leave the room, and he would vomit more. He would run around. Even though his mom and his brother were there. His mom was there because she was vaccinated, but her tummy was upset so I didn’t want to expose her to the dad. So she stayed in this room. however, when I stayed with Einie, he would vomit less. He would be calm. He would look at me occasionally. And he would just… be Einie. The little cutie pie that he was my baby Einie 



We then shifted him to drips. Three drips a day. He couldn’t eat or drink. He was losing himself. And I… was doing everything I could for him. every drip, every injection, every moment he shut his eyes, every scream, every cry, I was there but it wasn't enough....Now… I’ll bring myself to the last 48-72 hours I had with him.  I didn’t sleep for a single second. I was with him the entire way When he slept I really wanted him to live. Because he was so loving. And I really loved him. I really loved him. I really loved him.



It broke me one day. It was 4 AM and Einie lost response to touch. I rushed him to the vet the same vet who was doing his treatment. I made them their clinic as they weren't a 24 hour service i called and called until he picked up and i made him come to the clinic and here’s what broke me. Whatever I was telling him, he was on his phone. I had a suspicion of what he was doing. And then I saw it. The vet… wasn’t even trying. He was typing what I said into ChatGPT. Asking it how to save my boy as if i couldn't do that myself. all he did was copy paste my desperation... for a while i regretted ever bringing him to this vet but then again life and death is in gods hands not ours. he was at the point where i knew he would pass and i didn't have any money left to change the vet I had spent everything I had on these treatments. Every last penny. Every favor. Every drop of hope. That day, we got his medication done. I got home. I knew he probably wouldn’t make it through the night. I stayed. I stayed with him the entire night. He made it. The next day I got his drips. I got everything done.



I came back home. His breathing pattern changed. It felt like i was losing him, I was there cleaning every time he did peeopee or poopoo because he lost his urinary control and everything. He was slowly becoming a mess. I kept cleaning. And I was with him. somehow he made it through the night. And the next day I took him and his brother for the treatment. We got them drips, meds, everything. I came back. I cleaned him over and over. until i could not humanly keep my eyes open. ( i don't drink coffee or energy drinks ) And then I just slept a little, because I hadn’t slept in over 2 days



And as soon as I slept I shouldn’t have, but I did my mom told me to wake up. “He’s not responding anymore.” She woke me up and before she even said anything, I was halfway across the room to him. I saw he was drenched in his own peepee and poopoo because he didn’t have control anymore. And i wasn't their to clean him and the dignity sheet under him when tho absorbed some of his mess it got on him. I told ChatGPT all his conditions. ChatGPT said these are his final moments. And I refused to believe that. I said, “No, ChatGPT, no. Please tell me what to do to save him. Because I didn’t want to lose Einie he was my baby he was so loving. He slept with me. He played with me. He loved me. I loved him. I just didn’t want to let him go. i didn't want him to give up. he was at the end getting colder and colder



But he was suffering. He was suffering every time I took him to the vet. He was suffering so much. And it hurt me. It hurt me every time I saw him suffer, i wish i fucking wish i could take all his pain away i would a million times over. I prayed. And I prayed. And I kept praying. And I just asked ChatGPT to help me. It said, dry him first of all. Get him heat. get his body temp up  Get him an electrolyte solution. I ran to my kitchen. I took a pan thingy. Then I kept some water on to boil so I could pour it into that bottle and keep it under him. But until it boiled, I was just getting anxious so i asked chat gbt and took him upstairs into the sunlight not direct, indirect sunlight. I ran back down. I took a pair of scissors and a towel. I dried him. I cut all the hair that had poop in it to make him comfortable. I ran back down. I made an electrolyte solution using honey and a pinch of salt. I ran back up. And I gave it slowly, putting one drop at a time on his gum. At first, he wasn’t swallowing—but slowly, once every while, he was. So, when he swallowed it, it gave me just a tiny pinch of hope. And I held on to that.



I ran downstairs and I fell down hit my head broke my glasses but it didn’t feel painful. It felt like nothing. All I could think about was Einie. writing this i look and sound stupid but i just want to say it, I took him downstairs. I poured the hot water in the flask well not the flask, the water bottles, you know the water bottles that are for heating purposes. And then I kept giving him water. I kept cleaning him. At this point, I couldn’t even keep my eyes open not even for a bit. But I stayed up as long as I could. My body was giving out, but I stayed up cleaning him, giving him a few drops of the solution and i kepy talking to my baby telling him ""hey its gonna be okey dont you worry. you will be okey in no time and when you are we will play ill give u so many treats we will get you so many toys we will go on rides and we are gonna annoy everyone. i ekpt talking to him the entire day.



And then I could no longer stay awake. So I slept right beside him, with my finger in his paw. He was breathing really really fast. And I woke up every 10 to 15 minutes and gave him the electrolyte solution and i kept talking to him. I did this for hours. Until I woke up… and I was the only one that woke up. And there I was, looking at my baby Einie, lying there lifeless. He didn’t even make a sound before going. And all I could feel was guilt. Guilt for the pain and suffering I caused him. Every time he got an injection. Every time he screamed. Every time he cried every vomit every ounce of pain. All of that guilt it just flooded in. That I did all this. I caused him all this suffering. Just for my own selfish wants. so many, so many feelings came rushing in. And I just couldn’t take it, so I cried. I know a man isn’t supposed to feel this whatever tf i was feeling But maybe I am pathetic. But I did cry. And I felt… I felt alone. I felt vulnerable. I felt off. I felt rotten.



And… I cleaned my tears before my mom got here. I took him to the same park as Sultan, where I buried my baby einie too and then… I felt… alone. Even though this wasn’t even long. I was with these kittens for less than 2 months, and I felt like I had known them for a lifetime. And I loved them. And I would have done anything for them to make them happy. But they’re gone now.



After that, I changed the vet. The new vet isn’t as expensive as the last one, because I used up a lot of money for Einie and Archie together. But even though this vet isn’t as expensive, he feels just as qualified. We’re doing everything by the book to save Archie. He’s battling FPV as i write this. He hasn’t lost any weight, but he hasn’t gained any either. And now I’ll help him fight this battle And I hope he makes it. Because I love my cats. And I don’t have anything going on in my life right now… except my cats. even if i did my cats are my family and for once in my life i don't want to lose i want want them to leave.



I hope Archie lives. All I can do now is pray. 

when i die i want to get reunited with my friends my baby einie and sultan 

If you’re reading this and got this far… can you guys please pray for the health of my cats



Thank you everyone have great lives

Hi, I have PTSD from a certain event that happened in my childhood and CPTSD from other things, both from consequences surrounding that event and other childhood/teenager, even adult abuse and trauma.

It's been rough. It's been isolating and lonely, and I'm sure I don't have to tell you guys all about that.

It's caused me to have massive amounts of crippling anxiety, agoraphobia, insomnia, eating disorders, mood, and emotional issues. My whole body has been dealing with inflammation, probably since I was a teenager, and I've been sick on and off in different ways for a long time. It's messed with my hormones and whatever else you can imagine.

Some things have waxed and waned over the years, but I'm not going to get into all of that because that's not the point of this post. 

Anyway, I have had unimaginable stress and tension in my body even when I am not aware of it, as well as very strong uncomfortable feelings IN my body, like rage and anger and other things, that were really terrible to feel and caused very bad reactions at times (self harm, etc).

It was uncomfortable at times being in my body, and at other times, it was like I was totally disconnected from it. It was like my mind body connection was totally disintegrated in one way or the other.

Anyway, I've started messing around with an almino acid called L theanine.... 

What it's doing for me is unbelievable and incredible.

I don't know how else to describe it other than I'm getting ""Buddhist level"" awareness and calmness from this compound. My body feels amazing ... I had tension in my stomach that I didn't even know I had until I started taking this. 
How do I know? Because my body is no longer tense ... and I didn't even know that it was like that.

My mind feels clear. I'm no longer on edge. My emotions are still there, but they're much easier to process and handle and recognize. Pay reverence to and acknowledge that they're there ... but not necessarily overly identify with them. Which is amazing, I've never had that before.

There are other things too, like my hair stopped falling out, and my skin feels softer. Tension in my neck is gone... and when I first started taking this (maybe over a week ago), I felt the knots in my back, but they felt good.. like they were releasing. Like I was getting a very long, prolonged massage, or being in a nice hot bath with epsom salt. My eyesight is clearer ... My stomach feels amazing (it turns out L-theanine helps with gut health). I'm able to digest food better, it feels like. My skin looks like it's clearing up (I have a bit of rosacea, which sprang up a few years ago).

I'm able to articulate myself better without getting nervous .. I actually haven't been getting nervous much at all. Things that would set me on edge? They don't. It's interesting how many things I blew out of proportion.

Ok, but here's the BEST part, ok!! 

So the one very bad traumatic event from my childhood (the thing that gave me what they call ""military ptsd,"" even though I've never been in the military), I don't really like to talk about it, but it involved other people as well, so sometimes it does come up. That and the surrounding events around that.

Normally, whenever it does, which is rare, but whenever it does, my somatic nervous system is triggered, and I begin to shake and tremble. All to varying degrees, depending on how the topic hits... Not even full bars of xanax can help me sometimes (that's actually happened, where I could not stop shaking and trembling, even though I took two full bars ... with NO tolerance!!).

Well, that conversation was thrust on me against my will, maybe four or five days into my journey with L-theanine... and I did not get that reaction. Which is.. wow. My body and my muscles did begin to tense and untense during the conversation, but in a very, very, very slow way, which has never happened before. I did feel my feelings, which was uncomfortability, but it wasn't as catastrophic as it could be ... Nothing is. Nothing seems to be anymore. I was able to set boundaries and tell the other person calmly that the topic makes me uncomfortable and that I will hang up if they continue. 

Then, even today, another horrific aspect of the topic was brought up again by someone else, and I was able to articulate myself about it without getting stressed or tense or upset ... and that's never happened in my life. 

I'm observing all of this from the outside in and it's very interesting.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this in this group because I know some people in here probably struggle with some or all of this too, and maybe it could help you. I take way over the recommended dose, and... I think brand is everything. So get a very pure brand with not a lot of filler (like crowd source and do your research, and if you want, I can recommend you some that I'm taking).

Also, look into suntheanine versus l-theanine because suntheanine converts into l-theanine, and I don't know why, but some people think it's better. 

Here's a little bit more information:
L-theanine effects gaba apparently, which is probably low in some people who have high levels of glutamate in their brain and gut biome (usually people who have ptsd, ibs, etc, have high amounts of glutamate in their system I think... which can cause mood disorders like bpd, and bipolar, etc). This helps lower glutamate or at least level it out is what I've read.

Anyway, I am not a physicist, but I do know what this is doing for me. It is changing my life personally, and I just wanted to share. There's more benefits that I didn't get into, but I think you all get my drift... It's great.

I don't think this is the be-all and end-all for me, and this healing and integrating thing is a journey (I've been on it for a while and have done various things holistically with varying degrees of success).. But it's definitely a fucking great step to take and it's something I'm very happy I'm taking. My mood is elevated in a healthy way and I feel great. 

If you look into studies researchers have done with cognitive function, neuropathways, memory, and the brain in regards to L-theanine, it's just a plus all around. 

Anyways, stay blessed people ✌️ and we're all on this journey together. 

(PS if you are taking antidepressants you may want to look into l-theanine and contrainteractions and ask your doctor. I am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice, this is just one person reporting their experience. Also healthy fatty foods are really really good with L-theanine. And also, so is coffee. Caffeine and L-theanine are a super compound that helps with enhanced concentration) ",1,1744880658.0,u_throwawayinetgirl,0,1.0,False

1k189u3,https://i.redd.it/i306djhm1dve1.jpeg,my review on Smartdesk 5 Autonomous after 1 month use,"So I'm in the process of moving my long term desk, the super budget friendly Smartdesk5 got back in march of 2024. Wanted to share it here with this sub while I work on my upgrades to my new setup for one who considering this for your setup.

* **Price and assembly:**

I paid around $500 with a discount code i got from them, and shipping was free and arrived quicker than i expected. Assembly was about 45 minutes from openning to fully assembly even for someone who isn't good at diy

* **Usable space:**

As you can see this small desk comfortably houses my screens on an adjustable arm, my mic boom, all my audio and figures, and i still have plenty room even for my coffee and snacks

* **Build quality:**

First thing I noticed was the tabletop build quality like a tank with just a little dust, when i wiped it down it literally looks and feel like brand new. The desktop has really nice finish that's scratch resistant and i have some draw on it, still have some small lines here, its totally hidden, just small small one so i trust no one would even know it was there unless i showed them. But I haven’t scratch it yet though daily use with various gadgets and coffee mugs sliding across it. Design feels great whether sitting or standing and adjustable height motors are smooth and quiet, even after months of frequent up and down, up and down.

* **Cable management:**

One thing I love about is cable management build in this desk. It’s designed to keep cables tidy, mine always tucked away and messy so hidden which is 10 out of 10 for clean workspace and accessing this cable tray requires unscrewing a panel which can be kinda annoying if you’re trying to quickly plug something in or swap stuff out. It also comes with headphone hooks, which are cute bonus but I’ve knocked them off couple times by accident, just something to keep in mind.

* **Long term thoughts:**

Been a year and the motor still runs smooth, still look like brand new and hold up well my heavy setup. I switch between sit and stand through out the day without even thinking about it and I feel more productive than ever. Coundnt be happier now

***Final take:***

I don't think I could recommend this one enough, this desk has served me so well, in terms of price to performance, flawless. 9.7/10.",9,1744880526.0,AutonomousLounge,3,1.0,False

6-10 the headaches went and the real state of my fitness was so clear.

Joined gym and it was tough without the caffeine scaffolding hiding my poor fitness...

With the money saved in coffee I can keep gym going and my cardio and strength are on the up-and-up....get  better food, gym supplements etc.

  
I'm not going back - as the crazy levels of caffeine I was taking messed up multiple dates with women last year, I can now approach women in public now for their phone number and generally don't feel like I'm 1-mile back from the front line of a war border being bombed relentlessly.. all this commentary all from a caffeine head for 25 years.

  
I'd say to taper off to others thinking of quitting, but taper off fast vs going cold turkey.

  
It's like living in a new world off the stuff..only single thing is I don't not have that instant snap of mind on recall of information but I'm working on that with other herbals.....lion's mane etc.

-20g (medium grind?)
-300g water @ 93 degrees 
1: Switch closed, pour 60g
2: Switch closed, at 30 seconds, pour remaining 240g
3: Open Switch and allow flow down once timer hits 2 minutes
4: Flow is finished at around 3:20

My roommate and I were given a Rocket Faustino (I think this is the model, not sure though) which as I know is an espresso focused grinder, yet we have been using it for simple V60 recipes with other beans and have been happy with our results. We are unsure how to determine grind size, which is why I have included a photo of the grinds below and also the finished bed.

Yesterday she gives me a call saying that capsules aren’t being pierced and that the machine is barely frothing milk. I come over today and this whole thing happened just a few minutes ago. I select the lungo coffee and the pump engages but the water goes straight into the drip tray which instantly tells me it’s the solenoid valve that’s damaged, the machine didn’t make the typical click/buzzing sound when brew button was pressed. Out of interest I also turn on the milk frothing option. Bad idea. It steams very well but a few seconds later a loud pop, electrical smell and smoke come out of the machine.

I understand that it can take 4 and towards of 10 pounds of beans to fully  season the grinder - and maybe similar for others. 

I have a hard time imagining sitting down and hand grinding 10 pounds of beans before brewing and drinking cups. 

The approach I used with my Kingrinder K6 was to make coffee with it and season it as I went along. The cups were good enough from the start and improved much over the months. But the benefit  was more that the grinding  was easier than improved flavor

I did notice I had to season for different settings. Basically I got it tuned for pour a
over but then needed to break it in for espesso. though it didn't take as long.

The evolution of present day workplaces has introduced approximately a sizable shift in how we understand expert environments. Shared office areas, once visible as convenient alternatives to standard places of work, at the moment are becoming essential hubs for innovation, collaboration, and network. While infrastructure and amenities are essential, it’s the emotional and psychological connection that makes people stay. One of the most essential yet [underexplored](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5370866393992555102/1207614586440790561#) components of this is the feel of belonging.

# Understanding Belonging inside the Context of Shared Office Spaces

 Belonging refers to an man or woman’s emotional revel in of feeling regular, valued, and covered inside a group or space. In shared office environments, where specialists from numerous backgrounds and industries coexist, the assignment lies in growing a lifestyle that fosters inclusion and interpersonal connection.

F/ff female domme, female subs, Sometimes Dubious Consent, Slavery, Humiliation, Bondage. Mistress Mary's Morning Routine With Slaves Sheila And Layla. Her Plan To Use Them To Boost Interview Ratings","Mary's perspective 

I wake up to a mmmphed ""Good morning Mistress Mary, this is your wake up call."" Goof origin, iswees arii, if ith or aka uf all."" Two pretty exotic brown eyes, peaking out of the black vet wrap covering her head  down to her waist, with her breasts exposed. A tray is strapped to her waist, anchored to her pert brown nipples, holding my morning coffee. I look down at her bare pubic thatch which I shaved into a cute little heart, licking my lips.

When my gaze comes up it is stern. Those pretty mixed race eyes are nervous, but to her credit, this beauty of a veteran fetish entertainer doesn't look scared. ""Slave Zero, I think you were thirty seconds late with your wake up, how could you be so lax? Should I take disciplinary action?"" It is a rhetorical question meant to flex my power. The slave's nervousness stays the same, knowing she can only accept what is to come. If she begs or blubbers, any arbitrary punishment I give her will be worse and she knows  it.

Truth is, if she was late at all with her wake up, it was the fault of the Junior Domme who set her butt plug. She wasn't supposed to give her greeting until she felt it buzzing her anal canal. Her morning job was being at my bedside twenty minutes before eight and standing quietly at my bedside with my morning coffee for after she delivered my wake up.

Junior Dommes who knew Sheila Connor, aka Slave Zero, as the former Boss Bitch loved to prank her and get her in trouble. The first week they attached bells or remote noise makers to her to wake me up early. When I got tired of playing along and punishing her, I told them if it happened one more time, the Junior Domme listed as Zero's Mistress Of The Day, would replace her as my Coffee and Wake Up Slave for the following day, and spend the whole rest of the day as a slave. As a bonus, if I could identify her worst enemy and/or rival, they would be HER Mistress Of The Day for her time as a slave.  They smartened up, at least stopped being so obvious. But they still tried to subtly prank me and get Zero in trouble by fiddling with her ""Alarm clock"" butt plug settings. Truth was, I'd be disappointed if they didn't try, and sometimes I was in the mood to punish Slave Zero, for their fuckery.

That is not today, too many more
important things to worry about.

I sigh long sufferingly. ""I guess I'll let it go, this time. Aren't you lucky to have a merciful Mistress like me, Zero?"" Her quick reply ""Yeph, iswess ary!"" with forced enthusiasm. She is so good at knowing when a question isn't rhetorical, I have to remember she has more time in BDSM then all but the most senior Dommes in Queen Of Mean's compound. 

I swing my legs over the edge of the bed, reaching for the silver coffee service and the delicate China cup. ""Mmmm, French Roast, my favorite. Yours too, right, Sheila? Heard your sister likes it as well, you even pour it for her like you do me. Sucks getting shuffled to the bottom again, but maybe you've found your place, mmmm?""

I lean back on my pillow, relaxing and sighing, pretending she's beneath my notice for the time being. I eye how stoically she stares straight ahead at slave attention, just a hint of anger and a slight tightening of her lower jaw noticeable under the vet wrap. I smirk a little while I sip my coffee. You're beneath me where you always belonged, you uppity little half breed, I'm glad you realize it!

I think about a second cup, but I have too much to do today. I hit the intercom on the night stand beside my bed and contact the Mistress for the day for Slaves Zero and Border Bunny, a cantankerous 18 year old red head from England, Mistress Amelia.

""Mistress Amelia, is my Shower and Grooming Slave ready in my bathroom?"" I smile at her heavy British accent over the intercom. ""Sure is, Mistress Mary. Cute little brown bird is waiting with her pert dark arse and tits hanging out right by your bathtub. Didn't give me no excuse to cane her, though her rear is so adorable I almost made up an excuse any way.""

I chuckle, watching Sheila for any reaction to how we're treating her Mexican friend just as crappy as we treat her. The half Vietnamese girl is totally calm now, eyes unreadable. Darn, I know she feels bad for her friend Layla. Despite their ""cover story"" over at the Perseverance set of a leadership shakeup, I'm pretty sure Miss Vasquez volunteered for this Slave gig to watch out for her BFF Sheila.I hate the bitch, but I respect the tough former Jarhead would die before being coerced or forced to become a sub, she had to have made a decision. Oddly, that makes my treatment of the pretty Latina ex-Marine more enjoyable. And I know Sheila. She has to feel guilty her friend sacrificed her title and perks as top domme on the Perseverance set to join her as a bottom  slave.  If it was me I'd at least cut their paychecks, but that old softie, my ex Dave, still gives them all the pay and benefits of their old titles. Got to live in the present, does'em no good when they're assigned to serve here.

""Thank you, Amelia. There's plenty of coffee left in the pot, Sheila is here at your command."" Amelia gravely replies, ""Thank you, Mistress Mary."" Then her voice turns hard and mean. ""Zero, you bloody layabout, just standing there, I suppose. Move your bloody bare bum back to the Domme's Lounge, the girls and I fancy a cup of French Roast!""

""Yeph, iswess awelia!"" The Domme's voice stops her from moving. ""You call that a proper acknowledgement, Zero? Stand fast and try again!"" I chuckle as I head to my spacious private bathroom. I know how much ""Boss Bitch"" hates kow towing to a girl even younger then her almost 22 year old sister. But she mmmphs with gusto, knowing her place and duties in the hierarchy. There are so many ways I could communicate and send her back to Amelia. But this offers juicy public humiliation, I can't resist for my old boss and ""friend"" Sheila.

My Bathroom is off to the right of my entrance door to my Suite. My door is on the inside, while there's a servant/slave door to the right of the entrance that looks like part of the wall unless you look closely. I gave Amelia the remote code to let Slave Border Bunny in, though she was probably there to put her at attention and warn her to give me the best service possible. Quietly, so as not to wake me. I actually insisted Border Bunny was standing by in my bathroom at a half hour before eight. I knew the boredom was grating, but she was disciplined enough to take it in stride.

I come in to another black half vet wrapped girl with her tits hanging out. She has a body scrubber attached to the panel gag over her mouth, and a sponge strapped between her bare tits. I loved her big brown nipples rubbing against my back when I ordered her to wash it.

She was staring straight ahead, though she registered my prescence. Perfect Marine Corps thousand yards stare. I put my hands on my hips and wait. She knew her cue. ""Good Morning, Mistress Mary, This Slave is standing by to be the best Shower and Grooming Slave she can be for you, ma'am!""  Of course it came out ""Goo orning, ishwe ary, is wave es anting I ooo eee a est owe an ooming wave ee an ee or you, am!"" Close enough.

I waved off her polished despite the  gag greeting, I could make up a flaw to punish her, but today isn't the day. I look down at her shaved pussy, with the Mexican Flag Christina piercing peaking out from between her pussy lips. Someone, probably Mistress Amelia, had written ""Beaner Hole"" in black body marker across her abdomen where the vet wrap ended. An arrow pointed down to her bald, pierced genitalia. I have to have a talk with Amelia. So visibly racially degrading a slave is really skirting our rules to protect subs, even if she did allegedly consent. It did take up time with my duty as a Senior Domme to confirm her assent.

""Slave Border Bunny, did you consent to having ""Beaner Hole"" written on your abdomen referencing your vagina?"" The flag piercing was done by Mistress Nora, and is noted in our shared slave files with the Perseverance Set as something she consented to.

""Yeph, isweth Ary!"" I know she doesn't want to be seen as a snitch due to her code of honor. I don't think she fears retaliation against herself, but if Amelia or another Junior Domme picked up she'd be more affected by them retaliating against Sheila, who is already a favorite bullying target of the Junior Domme's ""Mean Girl"" clique, that could be a factor as well. 

""Sweetie, I know you're not a snitch or afraid, but if what someone here does really offends you or pushes past your limits, you're allowed to say something and have your limits respected. We'll protect you."" True in theory, though it is a point of pride on QOM's crew we find ways around it in practice. I very specifically didn't mention we'd protect Sheila...we would, to an extent. This slave doesn't need to know to what extent.

""Uh ine, iswess ary, oo oblems."" I'm fine Mistress Mary, no problems. I shrug, okay, my duties done. I record this conversation on my phone in the right pocket of my robe. So, I'm covered.

Until I decide to get uncovered by taking off and hanging up my robe, revealing my Blond PAWG nudity. I hear the Mexican girl breath sharply through her nose, though I know she's trying not to stare at me. I face her again, nude, hands on my hips with a big smile. I like girls and boys, but I know this little taco dyke lives for pussy.

""Look at me, bitch. Drink it in, I know you like it. All that time when I was Nora's slave, strapped naked to that fucking chair in the Ready Room, and you so eagerly volunteering to watch me. You liked my thicc blondie ass trapped under your thumb...Just like I like your thicc Beaner butt under mine...""

She'd rather look anywhere else but me, I know. But her eyes roll over me hungrily, just like I did when I was tied to that fucking chair, taking her abuse...as well as Nora's...and Boss Bitch Sheila just ignoring it all, too concerned about her precious position.

""We really have good chemistry together, Layla, a couple of thicc girls who have a thing for pussy. You were too honorable to touch me...but I kind of wish you had...might have made things...more...bearable. On your honor as a Marine, Layla, tell me the truth, you like being my Shower Slave. Two dummy thicc little dykes, wet and horny...together....so intimate...answer truthfully, Marine.""

""Yeph, iswess ary, I envoy is ea orning. een ought Uh ate uou."" Yes, I enjoy this each morning, even though I hate you."" She is staring at me directly now, as if daring me to challenge the honesty of her answer, or punish her for it.

Instead, I move forward until our nipples are rubbing together. I reach down to her slit with my right hand, my she is wet! She keeps staring at me boldly, but I heard her breath hitch when our nipples rubbed, and my hand touched her girl opening.

""See, baby, that wasn't hard. I knew you liked our special time together."" Punishing her for saying she hated me would be acknowledging her honest answer had value to me. I knew brushing it off would land at how genuinely I didn't care about her opinions in the current phase of our...relationship. Just bending her cravings to my will.

Our eyes meet. I see she knows I have her locked in her place, not just physically, but psychologically and emotionally. She isn't beaten, but she knows she is in no position to challenge our places in this current hierarchy.

I pull away and walk around her to the right, giving her a sexy, playful hip bump she simply endures. I turn on the shower, getting the right balance of hot and cold for my comfort.

I turn back go the slave. She's wearing shower shoes to protect her feet. Not sexy but necessary. There's non-skid strips in the tub, but a girl wrapped from the waist up, her arms trapped at her sides, needs careful handling to prevent accidental injury to her. Or me. ""About Face!"" I command. She does a credible job executing the military move to face me. Even bound.

We have a pretty good drill by now. I get behind her and put my hands on her shoulders to steady her. At my command she raises her right leg and steps into the tub. When she has it solidly planted, she follows with her left leg, me bracing her shoulders. She quietly turns to face the running shower head as I release her shoulders.

I step in in front of her, grab the soap, and start lathering up. In a bit of a hurry today, but I take the time to tease her, smiling back at her as I work the bar into a rich foam on my skin. I let her look at me without commanding her to. Every day we do this her efforts to look anywhere else but my naked body are futile, they're always drawn back to her buxom Mistress.

I very lightly elbow back into her ribs, careful to keep it gentle and playful. ""Come on Layl, this is your favorite part."" She hates my casual tone, and my pretense we're just two kinky lovers. But she dutifully scrubs, my limbs, chest, belly, neck, genitals, butt, kneeling and standing at my direction and with my assistance if needed.

Then comes my favorite part. ""Come on Layl, time to scrub Mistress's back, baby.""
She dutifully scrubs, grunting with effort but doing the best job that she can. In truth, it's an OK job, I could probably do better with a long handled scrubber. But as I said, those big dark nipples rubbing on my back is one of my favorite things.

Now it's time to shampoo my hair. Normally I help her out of the tub, make her stand facing a corner, and tether her there, as through no fault of her own, the poor bound thing is useless while I shampoo.

But today I'm feeling mischevious. I help her out of the tub, relishing her suprise as I open the servant's door to my bathroom instead of leading her to a corner.

""Go stand facing the opposite hallway wall, slave."" She looks at me, shocked. I can punish her for not obeying me instantly. but I smile instead. ""I'm calling Roz to fetch you, she said last night she could use an extra slave in the domme's lounge this morning."" She pleads with her eyes, looking frightened and desperate.

Roz is the manager, lead bartender in the Domme's Lounge. A spiked haircut, butch dyke former Marine with 21 years of service, she's sweet as can be to everyone, except to slaves. I think she's the only one here Layla's genuinely afraid of. With good reason.

When I got here as a slave, Roz cut me no slack. I thought she was harder on me when she found out I was former Navy. But the night after my official Domme ceremony, she congratulated me and bought my drinks all night at the lounge. I'd earned her respect in moving up from Bare Butt Slave, to Alpha, to Domme.

Layla hasn't yet, obviously. I actually wonder if Roz is harder on Layla for being a former Marine. But Roz is the only domme that makes Layla go wide eyed with fear, like she is now. I think it's adorable. It's hilarious to watch her scramble in the Domme's Lounge while Roz shouts at her.

""Go face that fucking wall now, Slave Border Bunny, and wait for Mistress Roz. Or do want me tell her you're defying dommes again?"" Her eyes showed some composure, though she still looked scared. She knows it is hopeless to argue. She turns and shuffles to face the wall, waiting for the Domme's Lounge manager to collect her.

I keep staring sternly at her back until her nose is centimeters from the far wall. As soon as I close the remote door I start giggling. Sucks to be you, Slave Border Bunny.

I text Roz, then am suprised when a moment later my phone buzzes with an incoming video call. I quickly toss on my robe and answer.

Roz looks affable enough sitting at a counter in the kitchen. Behind her a nude, arm bindered, hooded slavegirl high dusts with a duster attached to her gag. An Alpha Slave, unfettered in light blue coveralls follows behind her with a foxtail and dustpan, scooping up what the lower ranking bottom slave dislodges. They both glance nervously from time to time at Roz, who is for the moment ignoring them, I'm sure much to their relief.

""Hey, Navy, wuz up? Heard some big time Reporter from Fetish News Network, Bambi Sux, is coming to interview you today. Want me to fix my special spread?""
She turns to glare back at the slaves, when the fettered slave dislodges a large clot of clumped grease right on a stove top.  The Alpha Slave swats her restrained sister slave on her bare butt with the foxtail. ""Watch what you're doing, idiot."" The Alpha hisses at her charge. Roz, satisfied the cleaning is in good hands, turns back to me.

I have to make sure the Alpha Slave girl, Ann, I think her name is, is put in charge of Border Bunny for her suprise kitchen duty. I think I'll volunteer Sheila too, see how Alpha Slave Ann does with two or three slaves. Never to early to work on your Domme skills, once you make Alpha. Though maybe I'll talk to someone about giving the poor Beta on the screen the shift off, since Zero and Border Bunny are replacing her.

""Your usual VIP spread sounds great, but I have a serious proposal, Devil Dog.
Roz, how would you like Border Bunny and Zero as Lounge Slaves all day? I propose this, along with seeing if we can get Ann as their duty Alpha Slave all day.""
I wait to see how she'll take my proposal.

Her eyes glitter like a kids on Christmas. Sheila and Layla are semi-famous in the fetish community for their work on the Perseverance (People quickly forgot that Sci-fi fetish show was originally MY idea). They were leaders and dommes, even getting nominated for the Young Domme's Excellence in Leadership award for the First and Second Seasons. And they are both very attractive young women. All that made them sought after subs whenever the Perseverance studio loaned them to us. Roz looks positively hungry.

She demures halfheartedly, as I knew she would do ""Aww, Navy, what're you trying to do to old Roz? Those two little twats couldn't find their cute  bare butts with both hands and a flashlight. They're even worse tied up. Last thing I need is two air head ""Video Star"" girls tripping over each other every time I raise my voice a little at'em. Can't believe that Latina Girl used to be a Marine, doesn't look like she could fight her way out of a Sorority House party.""

I chortled. ""But they're very popular, as much as Bambi wants to talk to me about my renewed role on The Perseverance, seeing them is what draws people, specifically seeing them humbled. It's why Mistress Nora's ratings were so high when she mummified them in her office for the interview. We can do that little upstart pipsqueak one better. We were going to hold the interview in the Domme's Lounge, anyway. Let viewers see what these two leaders in the industry are doing now, laboring naked under the whips and floggers of eighteen year old girls. Bet we can beat Nora's ratings. We should at least try.""

Roz looks thoughtful, not that I really thought she was going to say no, anyway. I pretend to press ""Let's give that young Alpha Slave in the background her time to shine. Her name is Ann, isn't it? Make her Border Bunny's and Zero's Alpha for the day, if I can talk her Mistress into letting her be the Domme Lounge Duty Alpha Slave all day. I'll have no trouble making Zero and Border Bunny the Duty Bare Butts-I mean Betas, in the lounge for the whole day. We'll get a young lady some publicity, and see if she can control to Star Dommes turned slaves. Quite a feather in her cap if she can.""

Roz turned her head to look at Ann and her charge. Ann was scolding the Beta for more dirt and grease dislodged on a cooking surface. She scooped up some of it and flicked it in the slave's face, still scolding. She punctuated her points by shaking her flogger at the bowed head, mostly naked slave.

Roz has a cruel gleam in her eye when she looks back at me. ""Okay, I'm in. Will you be bringing Zero and Border Bunny to the lounge?"" The sadistic shine in my eyes must have matched hers. ""She's right outside the door to my suite, facing the opposite wall. told her you'd be collecting her...personally. Zero should already be in the lounge with Mistress Amelia."" Roz leans over, presumably to look out the kitchen doorway. 

""Yup, they're here. Amelia and her clique have drawn a dart board on Zero's butt. Real elaborate with scores and all. Trying to hit it with paper airplanes."" We share a nasty chuckle. ""I'll be along as soon as I get one of the ""mean girls"" to take charge of the kitchen. Gotta learn being ""Mistress"" isn't just throwing paper airplanes at slaves' cute butts all day."" The phone went dark.

I shampooed and blow dried my hair, loving the image of Ann scolding and whipping Zero and Border Bunny in the background while Bambi interviewed me.  Nora, eat your heart out!

Sorry for the long post, and thank you to those who take the time to read it.

I'm currently separated from the woman I was with for 13 years, and I sometimes feel like I made a mistake.

We met when I was 18, completely by chance, and we became a couple just a week later. There was an immediate and intense mutual attraction.  
I was really happy for the first few years, but over time, I started to feel incredibly lonely.

To be honest, we never had much in common. I'm someone who loves to learn—I read, paint, draw, play games (mostly PC), watch movies, listen to music, work out (weightlifting and swimming), etc. She... unfortunately doesn't really engage in many physical or mental activities. She mostly spends her time watching shows on her phone, and that’s about it. I watch series too, but we don’t even have the same taste.

One major difference between us was always intimacy. I’ve always wanted to explore everything with her, to try new things—I was open to everything. But it was always extremely plain, almost boring. She never wanted to try anything new (positions, practices... nothing extreme, just a bit of variety). I brought it up several times over the years, but nothing ever changed—no compromises. Eventually, I gave up and just accepted the frustration.

I’ve always been an active person. Before we met, I spent a lot of time outside, fishing, biking, or having coffee with friends. But after we got together, I slowly stopped all of that. She had fragile health and felt anxious when I was away, so I stayed in to be with her. I asked several times over the 13 years if I could at least pick up a sport again, but she didn’t want me to go because the training sessions were at night. Bit by bit, I began to hate going outside—it made me feel stressed and anxious.

Over the span of 10 years, I gained a lot of weight. I was still *kind of* happy, though. I made a lot of sacrifices just to receive a bit of affection. But the weight gain led to snoring, which kept her from sleeping. So I bought a mattress and slept on the floor in the living room... for two years.

One day it hit me. I had been sleeping alone on the floor for about a year and a half. I was depressed. I felt completely alone. I had dark thoughts. We had just had a baby—our son was one year old—and I was actually planning my suicide.  
What truly broke me was the realization that in all that time, not once had she offered to switch places with me. (Of course, I wouldn’t have accepted, but the gesture would’ve meant something.)

Everything hit me all at once. I’m a very romantic person. In 13 years, I never got a Valentine’s Day gift (I never missed one myself). She never planned anything for our anniversary (I never forgot it). I think I got maybe two or three birthday gifts total. I never asked for much—just one thing I never got: to be intimate with her on my birthday.

That’s when my feelings started to fade, which made things even worse emotionally. I fell into a deep depression. I lost 55 kg (around 120 lbs) in 6 months. I was put on antidepressants and sedatives, but they didn’t help. I slowly detached from her until, about a month ago, I decided to end things.  
It was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made. I’ve always taken care of her, and I feel *incredibly* guilty for leaving. I feel like I destroyed everything. When I imagine her alone at home, I cry for hours. I’m often deeply sad.  
I think I’m handling the breakup much worse than she is.

When I told her I wanted to end the relationship, she didn’t fight back. She cried a bit but quickly started sorting out the paperwork. She told her parents before I did.  
When I asked her why she wasn’t fighting for us, she said:

>

Which isn’t really true—I’m quite rational, and I always consider new arguments.

Since then, we’ve been cohabiting. I’m looking for a new place nearby so I can be close to my son. But I’m torn. What would *you* have done in my shoes?

I’m really struggling with the breakup. I swing constantly between sadness and hope.  
Part of me wants to go back to her—because, objectively, I still love her. But every time I think of that, I remember the deep depression, the loneliness, and everything I’ll *never* have with her. And it hurts.  
At the same time, I see her smiling every day, acting as if nothing’s wrong, and I wonder—why am I the one in so much pain? (Though I know she’s probably hurting too, deep down.)

Please... help me see more clearly.

We started with a WhatsApp consultation, where they answered all my questions thoroughly. Plus their great international support, convinced me to choose them.

The in-person consultation was detailed and reassuring. My doctors were Dr. Kim Song Heon for rhinoplasty and Dr. Park Deok Jun for liposuction, both professional and informative.
The clinic provides translators in multiple languages too! My translator was super helpful and made the process smooth.

The clinic vibe is calm, clean, and modern. They offer coffee, water, private seats with chargers, and although it was busy, everything felt organized.

Pre/post-op care was excellent, very thorough explanations. There was a small issue with my pressure garment due to my long torso, but they quickly custom-made a new one for me.

I'm on day 7 post-op. My rhinoplasty is still swollen but already has a great shape. I can also see a noticeable difference from liposuction. Both doctors confirmed everything is healing as expected, which makes me feel confident about the final results.

So I'm getting really tired of the apps. The audacity on some people is actually mind blowing.

So I have a crush on a guy that I have regular encounters with as I frequent this coffee shop as part of my daily routine. Im on first name basis with him and im crushing pretty hard. We have chemistry imo.

I know he will never ask me out because it can have severe ramifications on him if I feel harassed or something and report him to his manager. Like I get it.

On the other hand, if i ask him out and he says no i don't think I'll be going back to my favorite shop as often which is a pretty big deal to this caffeine addict hehe

Is it okay for me to ask him out? How would you do it? Am I missing something that I should be considering?

I am asking for some help from my Aussie constituents - with how to get a certain medication prescribed by a doctor. 
Here’s the context. My father, myself and as I just learned, my littlest sister all struggle with addiction to alcohol. very specifically red wine. 
My dad - well he’s a write off. I have never seen him sober in my life. Like actually never. I hit the rock bottom realisation about four years ago, but no matter what I did, tried, saw, nothing worked. Currently 7months sober, and married one month. My doctor prescribed me naltrexone, and it has done wonders for me. 
My wedding was in WA, and my family travelled over from NSW to come and watch. Just a few days ago, I get this massive text from my youngest sister describing her journey, struggles and the rest with alcohol (we had been estranged for over ten years, so I hadn’t even met her kids let alone shared a coffee with her in all that time). She wondered what I had done to get myself sober, as she too, has tried everything. So I told her my story, so, excited and encouraged, she went to her doctor. Who immediately dismissed her and pulled out all sorts of things about getting police involved etc. kids blah blah. She’s a good kid, full time job, family, exercise, just otherwise healthy. 
I know it’s hard enough for us to admit to ourselves we have a problem, let alone anyone else, so I’m wondering, has anyone got any suggestions of a doctor who will listen, and take a patient’s point of views into consideration??
TLDR: my sister needs a doctor in NSW (Sydney or Newcastle) who will help not judge, and prescribe naltrexone or contrave within a few visits. ",3,1744878036.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False
