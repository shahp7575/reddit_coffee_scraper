I'll give you my example:

**Think in numbers**

First thing I split the earnings of my salary to know exactly by the fil my yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly income - most important of these I think is knowing what you make a day and adjusting priorities and necessities of spending to fit within that daily rate, ESPECIALLY at work. Find a cheaper coffee place, choose a cafeteria, I decreased my daily spending by half by deliberately searching and choosing the cheaper option every time.

This, I'm sure, sounds like a complete no-brainer to most people. But I used to avoid all knowledge of my savings and spending, and that avoidance made me all the more reckless.",0,1737007874.0,dubai,0,0.5,False
1i2ikkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingAddiction/comments/1i2ikkt/2025_guide_to_starting_your_gambling_addiction/,2025 Guide to Starting Your Gambling Addiction Recovery,"When you realize that gambling has started to seriously worry you; you dream about it; you believe a big win could solve all your problems; your mind is consumed by the urge to gamble, and you spend more time gambling than ever before; you neglect your family and friends for it; your work performance has dropped; you’re absent from work; you spend more money than you have; you think about gambling more than you think about yourself; you can’t wait for your workday to end so you can go to the casino, the bar, or play that machine you feel is ""ready to hit""; when you lie and deceive your friends, coworkers, employer, and even your own family; you feel tempted to steal or actually take money that’s not yours; you experience thoughts of self-harm or even suicide—in short, when you feel deep down that you’re no longer the person you used to be—STOP.

This is a moment to say to yourself: **“I need help.”**

You’re not a bad person. You’re not worthless. You’re a compulsive gambler, suffering from an illness. And there is hope. We can help. Reach out to a support group or association, stay optimistic, and always remember: **IT’S NEVER TOO LATE.**

With recovery, you will achieve great things and, most importantly:

1. **You will stop gambling.**
2. **You will regain your sense of self.**
3. **You will inspire and help others who are struggling, just like you.**
4. **Your efforts will create a positive impact for your children and future generations.**

It’s worth trying.

**MASTER RULES TO OVERCOME GAMBLING ADDICTION**

**1. CUT OFF SOURCES OF FUNDING**

* Stop taking advances on your salary.
* Cancel any co-signing or access to shared accounts.
* Destroy your credit cards.
* Be upfront with friends and acquaintances—ask them not to lend you money. Tell them you won’t be able to pay it back.
* Absolute prohibition of any form of gambling.

**2. CLARIFY OUTSTANDING DEBTS**

* Make a list of all your debts (bars, friends, legal issues, family, etc.). You know them all by heart, even if you pretend to forget. Face them honestly.

**3. TAKE PERSONAL ACTION**

* Carry only the money you need for daily expenses (e.g., coffee, food).
* Provide proof of all purchases with receipts—this is crucial.
* Attend group therapy sessions regularly.
* Extend group therapy discussions into family life—talk openly at home, no secrets or taboos.
* Fill your free time with new, productive activities.
* Set new personal and professional goals.

**4. HELP OTHERS IN THE FUTURE**

* Share your personal experiences with others.
* Raise awareness about gambling addiction in society.
* Work to prevent gambling problems in younger generations.

**REMEMBER:** Gambling addiction is not a vice; it’s an illness.

By following these rules, you’ll stop gambling. But remember, these rules are just the foundation. The deeper issue lies in your past—your experiences, traumas, and emotions. Look back, analyze what shaped you, and address those feelings. Speak to the people who may have influenced your pain, but always remember: **You are the only one responsible for your situation.** Let go of resentment and free yourself from the emotional burden you’ve carried.

Do this for YOU and only for YOU. Be selfish in a positive way—learn to love yourself. When you’re at peace with yourself, the people around you will also feel that peace.

What’s lost is gone, not just money, but also time spent away from your family, friends, and work. You won’t get those moments back. But you don’t have to lose any more if you choose to stop now. Fight for the moments to come, fight for the present and the future. Take it one day at a time—**24 hours at a time.**

Understand that you alone are responsible for taking action to recover from this illness. While it affects you, it also affects those around you.

The process may be slow and difficult, but it’s worth it. Starting today, you begin to rebuild yourself. Starting today, you begin to live again and taste the sweet freedom of being in control.

**STAY STRONG EVERYONE.**

1i2ij7g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i2ij7g,Introducing Bird & Bear Coffee Company ☕️ Coffee meetup on MLK Monday at their roastery?,"My friend and I are visiting SF from OC. We found this adorable garage cafe in SF! It’s Bird & Bear Coffee Company, named after the founder’s twin kids.

When I’m in town, I occasionally host small coffee gatherings. After having a wonderful chat with the owner, we thought it would be fun to try it here in SF Bay Area as well.

On MLK Monday 1/20, we are going to meet Bird & Bear’s coffee roastery in Oakland. Since they operate their store based off of their home garage, we decided to move to their roasting facility where they have more space available.

* When: MLK Monday 1/20, 11:00 am - 12:30 pm
* Where: Bird & Bear Coffee Company Roastery in Oakland

75-minutes coffee gathering that includes —

* Private coffee roastery tour
* Guided coffee cupping experience
* Led by Dan, co-founder of Bird & Bear Coffee Company

For those who are new to coffee cupping, it is a method for evaluating and tasting coffee that involves —

* 👀 Observing: Looking at the green beans for defects and the roasted beans
* 👃 Smelling: Noticing the coffee’s aroma
* 👅 Tasting: Sampling the coffee to experience its flavors and notes

Coffee cupping is a professional practice, but anyone can do it. It’s a great way to: develop your sense of taste, learn what coffees you like best, and share your thoughts with others.

When enjoying coffee, we often try one full cup at a time and rarely get a chance to compare different types of beans. It will be a fun and unique opportunity to step into coffee roasting facility’s behind the scene and learn how coffee professionals enjoy their coffee.

Participation: $50 per person

If anyone who wants to purchase beans to repeat quality coffee experience at home, Dan will offer 10% discount on your onsite purchase.

👇 More details available in the RSVP link in the comment thread

Hope you can join us and make this coffee table happen :)

1i2iir1,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/1i2iir1/after_a_horrible_day_a_stranger_bought_me_coffee/,"after a horrible day, a stranger bought me coffee at circle k ","recently, I went to Walmart to do some shopping and to grab a money order to pay next month's rent, and it turned out that I screwed up and had bought too much food and was $10 off from paying for the money order. i'm a very anxious person, I am recovering from agoraphobia, and I had a pretty severe infection that I was only on day 2 of antibiotics for, so I felt *awful,* and I just broke down when I was at the money counter and she told me my card was rejected. bless her heart, she was polite and trying to be helpful, but I was just. tired and scared and upset at myself. 

when I tried to leave, I crashed into a gift card display and then just broke down entirely, sobbing with my face in my hands.
I left after that, found somewhere to sit down and sob for a while before I left the store...

the bus stop I needed to be at to head home is right in front of the circle k, and it was freezing, so I ducked inside. I was kind of considering putting some coins together to get a coffee or a tiny soda, went over to the coffee counter and then another man came in and started getting coffee.
I thought I was in his way and felt bad for standing there on my phone, so I apologized for being in his way and remarked I was looking in the circle k app to see if they had any freebies, and when I said that, he asked me if I needed money to buy coffee. I almost started crying again right there in the store, and I got all teary and told him that would help a lot. he handed over the money without hesitation, and I got a coffee. I mixed some house blend with another kind I forget, and put about a million creamers in it. it was good.

I want to preface this by apologising for the buzzword salad in the title, I honestly didn't know what to title this post.

I don’t know where else to post this, and as far as I can tell, there hasn’t been much attention brought to the issue which I’ll be writing about in this post.

Youtube comment bots are seemingly becoming more and more complex as I've started noticing the increase of completely fake bot comment threads ,mostly written by hacked accounts, often abandoned or forgotten by their previous owners, to make the comment thread appear more authentic. These accounts are often around 10 years old, and the threads sometimes have thousands of likes. I first started noticing this around 2020, and recently, it seems they’ve become even more common.

Has anyone else noticed this, or is it just me?

1i2icry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1i2icry/how_2_deal_w_partner_having_wealthy_friend/,how 2 deal w/ partner having wealthy friend,"In a 20yrs relationship, partner has a 'friend' ~9yrs now, whom I've never met, that's a wealthy now-retired successful CEO.  

Very much doubt if their genitals were not opposites and they weren't both heterosexual cisgenders that the friendship would exist.  

Never met this 'friend'.  Surely, never will.

Partner & I met when we were both young and penniless.  Got married and had children quickly - first date to pregnancy ~13mos.  

Have never falsely represented myself financially, but no great financial success, either.  I'm a small business owner, since 15yrs, and it has always made profit and provided for the family.  We have great equity in our home, and the business' name has fungible value...but it is a business in a dying trade (like selling horse saddles, for example), and there is not tremendously much anyone in my shoes can do about that receding tide of my business, any more than can a ski resort's operators fix their ever-increasing warm days' problem burning off the snowpack early.

In 7 of the 15yrs, I was the sole breadwinner. 

Of late this 'friend' (~2 decades senior to my partner and I) has become more present.  

Our daughter would love to go on a ski vacation - which I cannot afford to provide.  No problem, says my partner; 'friend' has private jet timeshare, extra hours on hand b/c they must buy annual minimum, and hotel points that can be used at ~any ski resort town.  

Full court pressure upon me to graciously accept free private plane + hotel (= only pay for ski lifts/clothing/food/equipment rental/lost production time at my business, none of which I can afford), because the child would love to have that experience.  

Doesn't end there.  The encroachment on my family unit from this outsider +2 decades and +many millions my senior never ends.  Don't they have their own goddamend family?!?

My partner wanted a fancier automated coffee machine, though on our own dime we'd bought a ~$800 model...so - poof! - the CEO 'friend' sends one to the house, worth ~$3400.  A very complicated machine, my partner expects me to learn the ins and outs of the new extremely high maintenance toy, which I never wanted in my home in the first place.  Every time I look at that motherfucker, I'll just see this interloper on my family.  I like making my coffee pour-over style, 100% manual, simple, slow, for 20+ yrs, since before my partner and I met.  Sure, you can't make an Americano or cappucino, but it is a cathartic ritual, and you don't need to learn any complicated machines (which I can't afford in the first place), and I'm cool with that!

I've traveled a ton.  Back when my eyesight was great (when film cameras still dominant), I was a serious professional photographer / avid traveler.  Sold many slides for side hustle.  My library of transparencies in formats from 35mm to 4x5"" is an extremely impressive collection by anyone's standard.  Exotic locales, awakening before dawn to get to the right spot, shooting the largest formats, graduated neutral density filters, color meters, Velvia...the full commitment, and the work shows it, sorry to say.   

Our family's suffered a great personal loss, through no fault our own, and we're currently rebuilding our homestead.  

Today, my partner said this 'friend' wants to donate some excess expensive artwork for the walls of the new domicile yet to be built.

The home we lost was small, but the walls were littered with my professional-quality photographs, the kind of things in size and excellence which if a stranger came to our home would invariably ask ""who made that??""   

Additionally, a large piece of irreplaceable art which I'd earned in barter before my partner & I met took up one of our walls, from a well known artist since passed away.  ~60x72"" size, a true statement painting.  The ~value of that piece lost in the personal tragedy was ~$20-30k, given the artist's recent sales.  

Now, my partner says there is to be ""a pair"" (they go together) of similarly-large artworks, gratis from the 'friend' I'm never to meet, which the CEO has in excess.

It is like this CEO character knows, w/o ever meeting me, what could bother me most!  

Do you think I want to stare at the artwork their CEO life earned, vs my hardscrabble NYC photog life earned thru personal sacrifice?? I don't give one shit how much $ they made, they could never have made the personal sacrifice to live in a 275 sq ft 6-story walkup mouse-filled apt, and commute to artists with their tripod and 4x5"" camera and lights and canvas muslin background, over and over, up and down 6 narrow staircase stories with bulky shit, doing so enough to gain a rep to make a living that way living all alone vs the great equalizer known as 'Manhattan rents'...so the CEO can take their fancy artwork and shove it up their fat ass.  IDGAF if you're Musk or Zuckerberg or little Jeffy and his big boat, you couldn't make that sacrifice, so go fly a kite.

When I was in my early 20s, I discarded a year of my future and lived as a true 'ski bum', and lived it to the max...I have reasonable certainty if that resort kept tabs of vertical feet on the lifts way back then, there can be little doubt I 'won' that ski season, b/c that was always my goal (to ski quantity), and I was a FAST skier... 50k+ verts wasn't unusal, for >100 days.  

While I'd love to share that experience with our children, skiing is MUCH more costly than it was in 1995.  No problem, though, this 'friend' is here to help!  I'd have greatly preferred the offer be anything else but skiing.

When I was younger, but already an accomplished photographer, in the years just before my spouse and I met and just afterward a large portion of my income was made from photographing artists' paintings and sculptures for transparencies for galleries' submission, and in fact for 1yr that was my majority income! Just like being a ski bum *on skis daily*, few canhave the skill to shoot 4x5"" slides daily artists' gallery submissions,...hedge fund managers and CEOs may have  much less replaceable skills in this world, but they don't possess *that* particular skill, and as an older gent I do take pride reminiscing on that.

My period of high employment as a documenter of artists is a point of life pride, as was earning an irreplaceable piece of art while so doing.  

For this CEO character to come along later in their life, 'mack' on my partner in masquerade as a friend, and offer some free artwork pairing b/c they've run out of wall space...and let's say the pairs' value is beyond the ~$20k value of the artwork we lost...pretty annoying, and with precision, I must say.

I can't bring this up with my partner, who employs an extreme DYDQM system; Don't You DARE Question Me.  

Question ANY decision, no matter how trivial, and you're sure to get gaslit as hard as can be had.  

Recently, my partner purchased some house'brand washing machine tablets from a nationally respected premium grocer brand, believing it was for the dishwasher.  My partner insisted for ~2wks they were for the dishwasher (in their defense, the packaging IS extremely subtle about the application, and this grocery chain puts the dishwasher and washing machine tablets just a few feet from each other on their shelves in their store).  

We had to discard several bowls and glasses b/c they would never wash clean, and to this day the dishwasher machine has white crust all inside that it never had before, from the ~6 or so washes it took for my partner to admit to themselves the appearance of the emperor's clothes.  

When I pushed back on day#1 that maybe this wasn't an ideal decision vs the overpriced Cascade [or whomever tricolored prefab tablet my partner had been buying the prior 2yrs had been the incumbent], GASLIT HARD.  That's always the move.  It is rote at this point.  Don't you DARE question me.  A decision had been made to change the incumbent dishwashing.

So, here we are...If I were to dare to bring out in the spoken word format how incredibly annoying and absurd this 'CEO-friend' shit is, GASLIT HARD will 100% be the outcome. I'm too old to care about that.  So predictable.  

But the pressure keeps coming; direct questions about when would be the ideal time to fly (private, direct) to the same famous town in which I was a ""ski bum"".  

Direct questions are not the norm in this ~20yrs relationship.  

I demur, I hedge, whatever... I just don't want to have to say ""I AM NEVER GETTING ON THAT ASSHOLE'S FREE PRIVATE PLANE, AND I DON'T GIVE A SHIT IT IT IS TECHNICALLY A TIMESHARE.""

But that's the truth; I'm not flying on their private plane, and I can't believe my 16 & 18 yrs old children wouldn't understand that, and I shouldn't feel bad or ashamed for my station in life.  Perhaps they know the DYDQM system better than I am aware?

Wealth has levels.  Whatever little I have been able to achieve, I've kept my 3 dependents fiscally solvent all 18+ yrs of their existence, and they have a boatload of vacation memories.    Just before my partner and I met, I flew to Kolkata, India for a wedding, as the guest of some importance for having traveled the furthest to attend.   

Though I was already a well traveled young man at that point, what struck me most about that trip was the GOBS of people I saw in Calcutta(then) who were obviously destitute and yet happy.  You could see it in their eyes.  They were content with their station in life.

I think about every day since, and how they'd mastered life...sober, no less! Amazing. 

Similarly, many yrs later in Milan, Italy, I saw a gypsy man begging at a farmer's market. He was unusually short, and the tremendous desperaration in his eyes gave me nightmares for weeks. In my forties, having lived in Manhattan a decade, I'd never seen such genuine emotion in the eyes.

The point of that was, my spouse was nearby, and they grew up in the third world.  Yet, the new-$ perspective of this CEO 'friend' is still able to render them clueless enough to how I should feel about such a scenario that I am to react normally when hearing that two ""huge"" paintings are to come in to our home if/when we're to have it again.

Marriage is tough.

Not looking for a solution here because none exists, but it feels better knowing more than I know this.   I don't want to commit you know what because I still have dependents, but the day the doctor taps me on the shoulder to say the end is here cannot come soon enough.

1i2iaja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/comments/1i2iaja/to_the_people/,To the people:,"Hello. I recently visited your presumably fine city, and I have to say, I did not enjoy myself.

Seems everywhere I went I was harassed, discriminated against, belittled, kicked out, yes sexually harassed, etc, apparently based on the characteristics of my physical appearance, as I gave no indication of political creed, religious affiliation, life philosophy, personal history, or otherwise. Like come on guys, my fashion sense is not THAT bad.

For example, a barista I interacted with saw fit to yell ""no"" in my face as I was attempting to order. Like fine, if you feel the need to publicly and preemptively cock block me by loudly stating your negative sexual preference towards my person, and thereby impress friends and bystanders alike, while letting that fella or lady you truly are smitten with know just how loyal you really can be... I can't stop you. I'm sure they're great. I'm just trying to get some coffee.

Ok ok ok, so now, you share a knowing look with the apparently psychic person who tells you what to think and how to act (they know about these things) who makes a simple gesture calling me a pedophile and boom. Game, set, and match. It's over. Not that either you believe what you are saying, but who gives a fuck at this point? It's just that the look on both your faces reminds me of a smug version of the look my dog gets when he is licking his own butt.

Funny story-up until recently, I worked with an actual convicted child rapist. The genuine article. And let me tell you, he was having a fucking field day with this shit. It's ok, get it all out buddy. That's fine right? He's a part of the movement, and everyone gets something.

Yes sir, it's a real pander fest out there. At an intersection, there is an environmentalist guy and a guy with the unnecessarily large and noisy truck. Given our recent political decision making process, you would think they would be staring daggers, yelling, celebratory coal rolling, etc. No absolutely not. Dudes are falling all over themselves to endear on another by shitting on me.

I mean, it's somewhat interesting how each of you has an individually unique rationalization for the exact identical patterns of hateful and abusive behavior. Beautiful snowflakes, falling. Just kidding, it's actually really easy to place you in a cliched typology and reverse engineer your justification for participating in fascism lite (tm) based on a presumable self conception. I don't give a fuck what lies you tell yourself in the mirror. But as your Bob Dylan said, it ain't me babe.

Point being, having superceded the political/and or any conventional rules of civilized conduct, in your fair city, The Movement (tm) (ha) or whatever the fuck you call it, is the dominant reality and governing social principle.

AND YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT IT

Which is fine. You do you. But please cease to labor under the delusion that you still have any translatable values of any kind at all. I mean, it would interesting to here you try but YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT IT. It is forbidden. I get it like fight club. That's fair. White guys have made some decent movies.

Let's say you dropped $100k on a liberal arts degree. Here's a chance to exercise some critical thinking about a mass social movement founded in cruelty and open hatred, which kind of the basic purpose of such a degree. Nope. Let's say it was history. What does this say about your field of study? Hide all evidence right? Or sociology. Beyond your purview. Philosophy. When in Rome? Congratulations.

A lot I could say, but regarding the thought this is just a spontaneous cultural movement (rationalization received from a Christian): 1. That is easily forensically disprovable, and 2. Shockingly naive, given the power dynamics of the situation, sorry no way are your overlords are leaving that much money on the table.

I don't really feel like elaborating further other than to say that because you are unable to speak or ""go back and forth with me"", whatever it is that you are participating in is bullshit on its face as you lack individual moral and intellectual agency, which is in fact and in spite of what may believe (that one is for the king himself), the root of all collective historical human failure. As well as being the only defensible rationale for a liberal arts education.

In closing, I don't want to go over the top here and start some kind of song of myself, but having been treated like human garbage, I feel compelled to state:

In terms of adverse personal experience, I soloed goddamn Annapurna in the snow season, lived to tell the tale, and this is the shit I come back to. Where boys fear to tread shit. You are all useful idiots and your behavior is an insult to the human condition. Why me? Because out of everyone in at least the entire western United States, you could literally put a gun to my head and I would not be on whatever bullshit from the literal church of corporate Satan you all are being spoon fed.

On behalf of myself, Jesus, the Buddha, and all the great ones who came before, Bellingham, YOUR SCENE SUCKS.

I try to be so polite and a perfect gentleman, really easy customer,  just a brewed tea or coffee, nothing difficult or fancy and I'm always polite to all the staff.

At my nearest store , the only nice tables and chairs are right under a speaker that is set to 72 decibels, too loud for a coffee shop IMO.  I ask them politely if they could please turn it down a bit , but they dont   or to no discernible degree. 

today the Shift  manager was rude too. I walk up to the counter but it's totally not confrontational whatsoever 

me: can we talk about the volume of the music?

shift: I can't turn it off.

me: um, ok I'm not asking you to turn it off

shift \[arms folded\] well i dont know what you're asking. You haven't asked me anything.

Me Yes I did I asked if we could speak about the volume. 

shift just actin so hostile i figure i dont want anything further with her. Im being so polite and she acting so hostile.  

Suddenly she went on break and the barista with whom i thought i had a good rapport and with whom i asked to speak was suddenly also on break.  

Why is she being so hostile? why not just have a polite conversation with a customer? find out what i want to talk about? if my request is reasonable, maybe compromise and turn the music down by 20 percent because all the customers are there to converse, read or write.  But she's obviously already decided i'm the bad guy 

The DM said they should turn it down if I ask  but also that it's set to the volume that the staff prefer.  She said there's no set level, but she also said that it's up to the shift manager if they want to lower the volume and by how much. 

The staff said the DM never talked to them about the volume or about customer requests to lower it. The DM said she did.

meanwhile another customer said the music was too loud, or that we were too loud, which proves my point that no one wants loud music or noise in a coffee shop

Then the shift went on break and had no time for me but apparently had time to write to corporate about the ""incident"" Then she pops her head out of the office and asks the partner if she is ok. Wow . is the partner ok with talking to a customer? Way to make me feel even more uncomfortable.  what I intended as a civil discussion about the volume of music in a coffee shop is being blown out of proportion and I'm made to feel like the bad guy.  

The DM also reiterates that the volume is set for the employees and that they can't turn if off! )again recasting my polite request to turn the volume down as pretending that Im asking them to turn it off, which everyone knows is untrue, obviously I.m just one customer and obviously i never asked for them to turn it off

I try to be so nice and polite and I dont understand the shift manager's hostility. Why is my polite request to talk about the music volume such a huge deal?. I was in no way confrontational with anyone 

She was very nice but I dont like the DM repeating the lie that I asked for the music to be turned off. No one is asking you to turn off the music.  I called customer support who said that the Dm has the final say and there's no way around her.

I was also abruptly hung up on twice today, once by support and once by the shift manager. the manager isn't here. click. \\ um that's rude, the shift manager has shown twice now that she doesn't have good manners appropriate for customer service or any business for that matter.

  
I have high blood pressure so rather than get all upset which I still am I think I just have to cash in my stars and find another coffee shop with polite service and ambient music.  

why is the music volume such a big deal? Im not there to make a big deal over the volume of the music? i think they could turn it down by twenty percent no fuss. i come in for a civil conversation and get treated so rudely. 

why are staff allowed to act with such a bad attitude and be rude to customers? there seems to be an attitude that being rude to customers is acceptable or tolerable. 

is it true that there is no way around the DM to someone higher? That's what support said. But even the DM doesn't seem to realize the store management at this location is a problem and even she repeated the lie that my request was to turn the music off. The DM didn't offer any resolution at all, she just said she will talk with the store staff.

*Written on January 16, 2025, at 5:00 AM*

My previous video post (if you haven't watched it already): **:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i13lfx/how\_hdfc\_bank\_enabling\_fraudsters\_to\_exploit\_pan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i13lfx/how_hdfc_bank_enabling_fraudsters_to_exploit_pan/)

# Introduction

Hello everyone, I am Ravi Singh—**the real** Ravi Singh. I am a victim of **KYC impersonation** who has been battling with multiple Indian banks and NBFCs for the past year. My goal is to protect my **CIBIL score** and financial credibility from fraudulent activities perpetrated by scammers who somehow obtained my **PAN** and **Aadhaar** details.

In this post, I want to share my ordeal in detail. This story highlights the failures of several banks (KreditBee, Axis Bank, Poonawalla Fincorp, ICICI Bank, and finally HDFC) in detecting and preventing fraud. It also explains how the **RBI Ombudsman** process works, and how you can protect your rights.

There were 72+ enquiries in my CIBIL in the past 12 months but these banks proved to be the most deceptive and cunning in their practices and support.

So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and learn from my struggle on how to fight bank fraud and protect your financial reputation in India.

# The Shocking CKYC Update (January 2024)

* **CKYC (Central KYC)** is a centralized repository of customer identification information. One day, I received an email stating there had been changes in my CKYC record.
* When I opened the attached PDF, I was shocked: all the details except my **name** and **date of birth** belonged to a **fraudster**—including someone else’s photo, address, and phone number. Lived all my life in NCR. This picture in CKYC is of the fraudster who was able to get KreditBee loan of INR 10K.

[CKYC Data reported by KreditBee, It was later Fixed by KreditBee Only After RBI Compliant](https://preview.redd.it/o5qh1u0r8ade1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f813355ccf28ac04b671bceca1a5e5d2f39738e)

* I immediately contacted the CKYC helpdesk and learned that **KreditBee** had updated my CKYC records.

# KreditBee’s Role

* KreditBee insisted I had taken a **10,000 INR** loan and claimed they had transferred the amount to **my Axis Bank account** (which, as I would later discover, actually belonged to the fraudster). I have only two bank accounts and none (never) in Axis bank.
* This fraudulent loan also appeared in my **CIBIL report**, showing mismatched details (the fraudster’s address and phone number, but my name and DOB).
* KreditBee **refused** to remove it from my CIBIL despite me sending them KYC documents, my **cybercrime FIR**, my CIBIL report, and more.

# Taking It to the RBI Ombudsman

* In desperation, I lodged a complaint with the **RBI Ombudsman** against KreditBee, attaching all relevant documents.
* After a lengthy back-and-forth (including video KYC verification to prove I was the real Ravi Singh), KreditBee finally agreed (around **March 2024**) to rectify and remove the loan from my CIBIL report.

[KreditBee Accepted their Flaw and Rectified the CIBIL](https://preview.redd.it/vsqtksoe9ade1.png?width=2792&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4998a84a95f4d5579fbf886bacf5cf4fbe6cc66)

[KreditBee corrected my Details in CKYC As Well](https://preview.redd.it/mhu7wljldade1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=699d47fef88167a5c943ce950616300d5e13aa4e)

# Axis Bank’s Massive Breach (February–March 2024)

While I was still dealing with KreditBee, **another nightmare** unfolded:

* I tried to use my Axis Bank credit card on Flipkart but never received any OTPs. I also didn’t get my February statement.
* When I logged into the Axis Bank app, I discovered that **all my contact details**—phone numbers, email addresses, even my residential and work details—were replaced with the **fraudster’s** information.

[Check the address, not mine, but of fraudster that matches CKYC data reported by KreditBee](https://preview.redd.it/g6nfthfr9ade1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d4cbb922d6077a60ace72258756388dcf366ddb)

* This led me to realize that **the fraudster** was getting my OTPs and sensitive statements. This huge data breach allowed the scammer to potentially apply for more loans and credit cards in my name.
* Around the same time, I noticed fresh **CIBIL inquiries** from Axis Bank.

# Struggle with Axis Bank Support

* Because my phone number was changed in Axis’s system, I couldn’t even authenticate myself as a customer.

[Address reported by Axis Bank - the bank rejected the Dispute on CIBIL right away. And this was reported to CIBIL when my complaint was with PNO](https://preview.redd.it/7m3ife1ifade1.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=779970be1daa765c6b9a6ab50f470f9fb8de55c7)

[the same copy-paste response shared by a new {NO officer every month with no action on the ground. Frustrating and stressful, especially after the RBI complaint. they have no respect for the esteemed office.](https://preview.redd.it/d0j2j3jxfade1.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=44f195e4a9579e6a384e737eabe912e67f24dc55)

* After much effort, I found and emailed the **Principal Nodal Officer (PNO)**. Their replies were mostly **copy-paste** responses saying they were “working on it.” And their excuse was ""The name, PAN, and DoB"" used for fraudulant Card Application/loan matched mine in their system and so they changed my Address, Phone Number, Email. And they never informed me via call, SMS, or email about this change.

[Axis Bank's One of the Initial Response after RBI Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/t70kt2auaade1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9ca9b0ec561c19404f9dcf7f0c59188712202c7)

* Eventually, I canceled my Axis Bank card to avoid further risk. Their official stance was that they had “no relationship” with me besides the canceled card and closed my service request without addressing the breach.

# Second RBI Ombudsman Complaint

* On **April 2, 2024**, I lodged another complaint with the RBI Ombudsman—this time against Axis Bank.
* Axis Bank kept **denying** wrongdoing and repeatedly stated the same response to both me and the RBI.
* It took **9 months** for them to finally rectify my CIBIL data in December 2024, a process they had previously claimed was impossible. I wrote literally 100 emails that took me several hours.

https://preview.redd.it/sqmongc4cade1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fcf70fd279496a3981988626d6872dd9f550e7b

* Eventually, they **paid compensation** (I demanded more, given the magnitude of the breach and the stress caused), but my complaint with the RBI Ombudsman remained open for nearly **10 months**. Received partial compensation, waiting for the remaining, if RBI deems it valid.

# A Wave of Fresh Loan Inquiries

From February 2024 onward, I continued to see **new loan inquiries** popping up occasionally in my CIBIL report. It seemed that the same fraudsters kept trying to open new accounts or apply for loans using my PAN. When I contacted various banks or NBFCs, most of them were cooperative and quickly fixed the errors—**except a few**.

# Poonawalla Fincorp (April 2024)

* **April 2024**: I discovered a new **2.8 Lakh INR** loan from Poonawalla Fincorp in my CIBIL report.
* They **ignored** my initial emails, and their PNO didn’t respond. When I called, he denied any conversation and threatened **police and court action** if I “shouted” at him. **Grievance officer for Delhi on 9876543498 – Gurmeet Singh** \- This information is Public on Poonawalla website from where found it! He said this is my Personal number.

[Public Info - Grievance office who Threatened me for FIR and Legal Threat](https://preview.redd.it/8rf9bkwzeade1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=302b3d13c2d805c38ce145383ac75bac0baf97b7)

[Personal loan account number reflecting in my CIBIL for INR 2.8Lakhs](https://preview.redd.it/h3slbrqkeade1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=847217492b77dd82523ad9d93604f99e44d3d33d)

* I lodged a complaint with the RBI Ombudsman again.
* Finally, a **supportive** representative from Poonawalla reached out, took my documents (Cybercrime FIR, KYC, etc.), and eventually **rectified** my CIBIL.
* I did **not** demand compensation here because they were already hit financially by their own failure to identify the fraudster.

[These details reported by Poonawalla are the same reported by Axis Bank, KreditBee - Scammer\/fraudster is still using these details. ](https://preview.redd.it/gab81n9pcade1.png?width=1337&format=png&auto=webp&s=dabd9686520afb3b60dce9e0dbcbf8783ef40c84)

# ICICI Bank (August 2024)

I’ve been an ICICI Bank customer since around **2014–15**, holding a savings account and a credit card.

* On **June 9, 2024**, I received a CIBIL alert that **ICICI Bank** had made a credit card inquiry in my name.

https://preview.redd.it/4js437s7iade1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e737973be7ef7ec24fa397f2ae52950508e1b7

* I contacted them immediately, including my Relationship Manager (RM), but she was **unhelpful**, despite knowing about ongoing fraud on my PAN.

[They denied. And this is when I am their existing customer with a card that has a really good limit - no help from the Grievance team, My so-called \\""dedicated\\"" relationship manager](https://preview.redd.it/1hxyd7m6hade1.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=848185876f0bb65c3b301667695584de7d089d8d)

* Soon after, I got an SMS saying a **new credit card** (Adani card with a 5 Lakh INR limit) had been **dispatched** to scammer's same Jayanagar address. Understand the gravity here, they literally dispatched it to the address provided by the scammer while I am in their system for past 10 years and no change in my address when I am checking iMobile app or statements.
* I insisted they cancel the card immediately. Though they canceled it, they **refused to rectify** my CIBIL record, claiming **I** had applied for the card.
* Then I got two new enquiry again from ICICI while my complaint was with them in July 202

# RBI Ombudsman—Again

* Another **RBI Ombudsman** complaint forced ICICI Bank’s compliance team to investigate. And this is what they had top say initially which triggered a series of investigation by RBI.

[They literally delivered the credit card issued to the scammer's address as shared in the response to the RBI complaint. At this stage, they did not realize what blunder they had made and thought that they were fine and it's the customer who was at fault - clearly not. ](https://preview.redd.it/fhlzwmpziade1.png?width=2690&format=png&auto=webp&s=af2e80eb2b81a5a2a2d31bc2783b822f185bdd91)

* After about **two months**, they finally removed the fraudulent card entry from my CIBIL. I demanded compensation, pointing out the RM’s negligence. their PNO Rashmi was very supportive and dealt with my complaint very well - Thanks to RBI.

https://preview.redd.it/gyzshnzqjade1.png?width=2744&format=png&auto=webp&s=da3f8a1ea840aa061cbec028a0def60d38e86bc0

* While the bank remains prone to such fraudulent inquiries, at least I now have a direct line to a **supportive PNO**.

# HDFC Bank: The Most Cunning & Deceptive (April–December 2024)

Finally, we arrive at **HDFC Bank**, which has been the trickiest to deal with.

* **April 2024**: HDFC reported **two credit card inquiries** in my CIBIL.

[You can See the HDFC April Enquiry here. And Axis bank still didn't stop from putting more enquiries. ](https://preview.redd.it/9x9ucdvekade1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4d4c749e3610ac913c2c73ca42dc14401c00712)

* I sent all proof (cybercrime FIR, KYC, etc.) but was **initially ignored** or told that I had applied for the card
* After 30 days of no resolution, I lodged a complaint with the **RBI Ombudsman**.

# HDFC’s False “Resolution”

* HDFC eventually responded that they would do me a “**favor**” and rectify the inquiry, offering a 2,000 INR gift card

[Look this was their resolution that I opposed after which they provided mixed logs of a genuine enquiry done in Novemebr 2023 - the complaint was never about this enquiry and the fraudulant one done in April 2024 - againt which I complaint with them and RBI.](https://preview.redd.it/tfk5xp0nlade1.png?width=2736&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9bd9503bf31b6d683330d8c42e5d3a119d8add0)

* I was offended by their tone, as if they were doing me a **personal favor** rather than fixing their own KYC failure.
* I asked for an **apology** and demanded 10K INR compensation (willing to settle for 5K). This may have triggered them to not avoid paying me because if the accept their fault, they will have to pay. So they decided not to and presented misleading facts, fooling RBI Ombudsman beacuse I thing RBI deems the practice by HDFC valid which require no authentication from rightful owner of the PAN before fetching their damn reports. More about this below.

# RBI Ombudsman’s Closure—on the Wrong Data

* In **November 2024**, RBI Ombudsman **closed** the complaint, stating “no deficiency found” at HDFC’s end.
* The **PNO, Mr. Ripal Seth**, had apparently **mixed** logs from a genuine inquiry I had made in **November 2023** with the fraudulent inquiry of **April 2024**, misleading the RBI into believing everything was legitimate.

https://preview.redd.it/irngvh1jmade1.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=761a148462ea31022e9bbccef8aa1f05e5942700

* Because this was an RBI final decision, my only recourse was going to court.

# New HDFC Fraud in December 2024

* On **December 2, 2024**, HDFC again reported **two more card inquiries** on my CIBIL.
* I emailed the PNO (the same trail with RBI) and got no response for over a month.
* On **January 13, 2025**, I filed a **new** RBI Ombudsman complaint, detailing how HDFC had **deceived** the RBI previously.

# HDFC’s Fraud-Friendly Application System

Curious about how these inquiries keep happening, I decided to test HDFC’s **online credit card application** process:

1. **All you need is someone’s PAN.**
2. **Enter any phone number** (not necessarily linked to that PAN).
3. HDFC **pulls** the CIBIL report for that PAN, **regardless** of whether the phone number or address matches the actual PAN holder.
4. If the PAN is found “eligible,” it can proceed to an “OTP verification” that might be tied to the **fake phone number**.

**Here's the complete video. Please watch :** [https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i13lfx/how\_hdfc\_bank\_enabling\_fraudsters\_to\_exploit\_pan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i13lfx/how_hdfc_bank_enabling_fraudsters_to_exploit_pan/)

This means **anyone** with your PAN can damage your CIBIL score, even if they don’t have your Aadhaar or other documents. **HDFC** doesn’t properly verify identity before pulling your CIBIL, so the **fraudster** effectively has a free pass to ruin your credit history.

When confronted, **HDFC** claims that “OTP verification” is enough proof of identity—and even the **RBI** has accepted this logic when presented with distorted facts. Meanwhile, innocent customers like me keep getting their CIBIL scores dented.

# Why I am Sharing This

This took me 5-6 hours to prepare and structure my story and several hours and mental peace that I lost over last 12 month just beacuse Indian banks failing to validate or identify a simple fact which is their duty, i.e., ""to ensure that the person or applicat is really is who he/she claims to be."" Especially in todays digital age and in India where data privacy and protection are non-existent. There are no laws or regulations as such that a citizen can use even if he/she wants to pursue it legally.

I’m sharing this story to **warn the public**:

1. **Monitor your CIBIL** regularly.
2. **Stay alert** for unauthorized inquiries or accounts.
3. **Keep an eye on your CKYC data**. Any change, immediately take clarification from CKYC who updated this and reach out to them for correction.
4. **Lock your Aadhar Biometrics** to avoid any loan processing in your name and PAN. Enquiries won't stop with this but loans processing will.
5. **Act quickly** with both the bank and the RBI Ombudsman if you spot fraud.
6. **Don’t lose hope.** If you are honest and persistent, you will eventually get your record fixed.

These experiences show that **some Indian banks**—especially HDFC—are enabling fraudsters by having **poor KYC verification** procedures. When victims speak up, they often face denial, obfuscation, or blame-shifting as I showed in this post with all proofs. I have many more proofs but there is a limit of 20 images in a post on Reddit.

Even the RBI Ombudsman process can be misled if banks present **false or incomplete** data. There seems to be no checks!

**Please share this post**, talk about it on social media, and **tag** the right people or authorities who can amplify the issue. We need proper checks and accountability in the banking system to ensure no one else goes through this mental stress, harassment, and potential financial ruin.

1i2i5np,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1i2i5np/boomer_grandma_constantly_buying_junk_food/,Boomer Grandma constantly buying junk food,"So I live with my Mom and Grandma, and my Grandma is thoroughly a Boomer.  I've made a number of posts before about both her and my Grandpa because... they're just very hard to deal with, and between them they meet literally every Boomer stereotype.

I'm mostly making this post because I think I may have found a cockroach in our kitchen for the first time, and it's likely because of my Grandma's food habits.  I've never seen someone buy so much junk food in my life, and often it ends up getting left out, or thrown into our trash half-eaten.  She primarily eats fast food, and every time she goes to the grocery store buys mostly candy, cookies, and pastries.  She almost-exclusively drinks soda, and often will barely eat dinner but then subsequently have like 6 Chips Ahoy cookies as soon as she throws out her plate.  The other day I saw her come home with a coffee and donuts and immediately dump a shitload of sugar into the coffee, and down like 3 donuts all at once.  

Also, relatedly, she refuses to use regular plates and cups, and instead will only use plastic cups and paper plates.  She claims it's because it makes less dishes (even though she's not even the one who does the dishes).  But all I see it do it create a TON of extra trash.

And alongside all of this, as I said she doesn't store her food well either.  There's half-open packages and stuff around, and I'm pretty sure she hides food in her room too because my Mom will often get onto her about her eating habits (especially because a doctor told her she's diabetic but she refuses to listen).",1,1737006240.0,BoomersBeingFools,3,0.67,False
1i2i5lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1i2i5lz/baby_christian_in_need_of_actual_good_advice/,Baby Christian in need of ACTUAL good advice!," Ok. Strap in cause this might be a very long post… but to start this out, I am a young man. 15 to be exact, and I have just started my walk with Christ back up after years of being cutoff from him. And it has been quite… difficult to say the least.

I grew up in a strict home surrounded by faith. Always pray before dinner, wake up early on Sundays and go to church, yk, the nice stuff. Only problem was my younger self never really felt any presence with me during any part of that life. I hated praying before I ate; I wanted to eat as soon as I got my plate, as any 5-10 year-old would want to do. And going to church was never a fun experience for me as well. I remember my pastors teachings would always make God out to be a cruel being of great jealousy or vengeance, and as I got older it drew me away from him.

Now fast forward to the pandemic. I had truly turned my back on God, picked up some awful habits—ones I’m just now breaking—and even started delving into the occult, as crazy as that sounds. But what else is a 12 year-old going to stumble upon on the internet, other than the worse things a young kid could ever lay their eye on?

And now that brings us to the present. The way the world is going, I need something to have faith in, something that I can look forward after my time here is done. I have been practicing my faith for a few months now, and I am just now having doubts. Bad habits have come back, and the presence of God is leaving me once again—or at least that’s what it feels like.

It also doesn’t help that the media does absolutely no justice to anything religious. For example, I’ve seen so many videos claiming: “God created the L.A. Wildfires, REPENT!” or my personal favorites: “Bad trip on shrooms, or religious experience?!” And that is truly just the tip of the iceberg berg. And going deeper, another group of media I see from Christians is hate towards homosexuality. And before you click off, please let me plead my case!

I myself am not gay, but I like guys and girls. Guys preferably. And I know what the Bible says about that stuff, and I know how the church reacts to it, but is it really that bad? Is it ever truly stated it’s a sin? The quote I remember is Jesus saying homosexuality is detestable, but that’s really all I could muster. And keep in mind, I have been doing better at trying to alleviate all sin from my life. I am able to identify my wrong doings and change them. But me feeling a type of way towards a male is still something after all these years just doesn’t feel wrong at all. 

But now I of course am questioning myself. Yes, the Bible says it’s detestable, but will that really make Jesus love me less enough to cast me out of his kingdom forever? Or if I “decide” not to turn from it, will it just be something the Lord tally’s up in my column on judgment day? And again, this is truly something that does not feel wrong to me like so many other things I have identified. I have been in such healthy relationships before with guys, and even with some who share the same faith. And I would also like to point out that before any bad habit or evil thought worth condemning even touched my mind, I have always felt this way. In fact, I just really figured out I like girls too. I remember thinking: “Has the Lord freed me from homosexuality? Were those people on social media actually right?” And the answer was no, because guess what? I still very much like guys as well. So I guess to some that part of the post up, I’m a bisexual young man, who is heavily confused on what the Bible means about homosexuality, as well as people. Is it what the word actually means? Or is it just up to interpretation at this point?

Moving on from that part though, now my concerns lye with me. And I’ll lay these out quickly, because I can see this post is getting long…

But basically I am an artist going to studying my art. I write poetry, sing, act, and do digital and street photography. The art that I put out could be seen as problematic, but I am trying to convey a message; yet I have still gotten the idea that my thoughts that I turn to reality could be blasphemous in a way—or at least not aligned with God. But he gave me these gifts, and until recently, I thought these were the visions he was giving me, but now I’m not too sure.

And lastly, to sum up this email, and get to probably the most important part of this cry for help (most important to me at least) is how do I hear Gods voice? My mind is never quiet. When I think it’s God’s voice, it’s just my head, or my conscious. I tried to hear him through scripture, but I don’t know the Bible well enough to confidently flip to a random page and take what it has to say to heart. So any advice would be greatly appreciated in that aspect.

1i2i2lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i2i2lf/the_dancing_man/,The Dancing Man,"It’s been three years since the dancing man took her.

It was the first weekend of summer vacation. We lived on a quiet county road in a very safe but rural area in Ohio. We had a large back yard that shared two borders with different corn fields. The other two borders were shared with some woods that had a small but healthy creek running through it. My wife, my daughter and I spent our summers outside enjoying the freedom and safety in what felt like a little slice of heaven.

It felt so normal. The day felt like the first day of summer is supposed to feel. We were on the porch enjoying our coffee. We were just watching her play.

I remember she was picking the clover. Picking clover and befriending a host of harmless insects, discussing her summer plans with them and complimenting the way the sun made their wings look. I thought this is what she was doing when I first saw her chatting to something in the woods. We were so safe. Every instinct told me so. 

He had such a warm and casual demeanor when he stepped out from the tree line. He was old…frail…very thin, even gaunt, and hunched over an old wooden cane. He was dressed in a grey tweed suit and wore a black felt hat with some type of wildflower tucked in the band.

Despite his non threatening appearance and friendly demeanor, the circumstances of his arrival immediately set off every alarm bell and protective fatherly instinct.

It felt like reality was bending. Though panic and adrenaline fueled my pace and the path to my daughter was unobstructed, I could not close the distance. It felt like faulty dream logic had seeped into a waking nightmare. I would trip over imaginary obstacles, get turned around mid-step, feel like my shoes were tied together, or like everything was coated in lubricant. I can’t explain it. Reality was shattering. I couldn’t reach her.

I watched in desperation as the man sweetly presented her with the wildflower from his hat, which she gratefully accepted. 

The man then looked at me with wide unblinking eyes and lifeless grin and began to dance. His dance was unnatural. It lacked rhythm, or any kind of pattern whatsoever. The movement was spasmodic, but felt primal and meaningful. He was unnaturally limber and appeared to be double jointed in several places. He never blinked or broke eye contact. It was grotesque. 

I was about to be sick when my daughter slowly turned to face me. Her face had changed. She was wearing the same empty grinning expression as the man. She turned until she was squarely facing me, at which point she briefly paused before beginning to dance.

She danced in horribly perfect lockstep with the man. Though she didn’t seem to be processing pain, I could hear her joints snap due to the unnatural range of motion the dance demanded. 

Neither of them blinked or broke eye contact as they backed into the woods together, their movements perfectly synchronized.

It’s been three years. No trace of my daughter or the dancing man has ever been found.

1i2i0r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1i2i0r1/how_i_landed_my_first_65k_deal/,How i landed my first 6.5k deal ,"I’ve been doing small freelance projects forever, mostly designing websites for local shops but nothing really took off in a big way. A few months back, I decided to target a more specific group: coffee shops that needed an online order system. The idea seemed super niche at first, but I figured I’d rather be the go-to person in a small market than just another web designer in a huge one.
At first, I tried cold emailing a bunch of cafes. Got a few replies, but nothing crazy. Then, I remembered a friend of mine had mentioned LeadsNavi, so I decided to see if it could actually help me find more targeted prospects. I was skeptical, but it definitely helped me figure out which cafes were already searching for something like online ordering. That gave me a list of potential clients I felt were warmer leads than just pulling random places off Yelp.
In the meantime, I also asked my existing clients for referrals, which I used to avoid because it felt awkward—but it turned out that word-of-mouth was a huge boost. I ended up combining those referrals with the leads I found through LeadsNavi, and that’s how I landed a chain of four local cafes who were ready to invest in a custom online ordering setup. We worked out a deal that came out to around $6,500—easily my biggest single project so far.
It wasn’t as simple as “download software, get rich,” but it did help me find the right people at the right time. I’ve still got a long way to go, but for me, getting that first solid pay-off was a huge win. I’m testing more tools and refining my approach, but I’m convinced that finding legit leads and asking for referrals are two of the biggest game-changers for a small operation like mine.",4,1737005694.0,passive_income,1,1.0,False
1i2i0b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Walkietalkie/comments/1i2i0b4/i_need_a_suggestion_on_which_walkie_talkie_to_buy/,I need a suggestion on which walkie talkie to buy,"Good evening everyone,

I am Brazilian and do not speak English very well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.

I have been researching walkie talkies/radios for a few days now. I am aware that certain types of radios require a license for amateur radio operation, etc., but my situation is as follows. I live in the countryside, a mountainous region, and I work with coffee farming. I have a farm where there is no phone signal, no internet network nearby, and no electricity. This farm is 3 km (1,85 miles) away from another farm which is the ""headquarters"" of the work activities, and I need a means of communication between these two farms. There have been situations of work accidents, and since it is uncommunicable, it has been very difficult to notify someone and get help. So I understand that even if it is not 100% correct to use this means of communication, it is literally the only possibility we have to not run as much risk as we have been running. I think the simpler ones up to 0.5w would not be enough, after all, as I said, it is 3 km away in a mountainous region. Here it is a city of 10,000 inhabitants, where I believe there is not much use of radio. I have heard that the employees of the municipal works department use it for the same reason, because when they go to do services in the interior regions of the municipality, they become uncommunicable.

So I would like suggestions on which device would be suitable for this use. Watching some videos and reports on the internet, I found several options ranging from R$ 100 to R$ 300. These are Baofeng BF 1909, UV 17 Pro V2, UV 17, UV 5R, 777S, 888S, Retevis RT 86, and Quansheng Uv K5. I saw that among these, some are stronger, with different battery capacities, etc., but I would like the opinion of those who already use them on which is the most suitable for the situation I live in.

After I manage to install electricity at the farm, I plan to install a Starlink. However, until then, I think the only way would be through walkie talkies.

Thank you in advance.",2,1737005646.0,Walkietalkie,0,1.0,False
1i2hzys,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i2hzys/my_organ_donor_is_still_alive/,My Organ Donor is Still Alive,"

This kind of thing is never supposed to happen. At least not in this country, and certainly not in this day and age. Organ donations are supposed to be safe, and regulated, and mistakes like this are not normal. At least, I hope not.

I’m old enough to remember a time in my small town when we didn’t even have a hospital, and now our little burg has a full clinic and even a couple surgeons. It used to be that if you stepped on a rusty nail, or your uncle had an accident in the mines, or your meemaw fell off her porch, you’d ring up a friend and they’d drive you over to Ivy or Haverton or wherever they’d built the newest and nearest hospital, and you’d hope you didn’t die on the way there.

Sickness is different though. When your small town’s entire economy survived off of the slowly declining output of one of the oldest iron mines in the state, you tend to have a lot of men getting sick, and its not always something they can just drive you over to the next town to fix. Silicosis, heavy metal poisoning, and lung cancer are our neighbors here, each their own grim reaper we all expect to come knocking at some point. 

I was just a kid when I was diagnosed. My parents called it my “ailment”, but Dr. Hill at Ivy Presbyterian called it “restrictive cardiomyopathy.” The muscles of my heart were too stiff, likely caused by hemochromatosis- too much iron in my blood.

All things considered though, it didn’t hold me back too bad. Sure, I never fulfilled my dad’s dream of going to play for Tennessee state, but I still earned my degree. And sure, I did have to ask my prom date to slow down a few times so I could catch my breath on the dance floor, but she still eventually agreed to marry me.

When I graduated, my wife and I decided to move back home. Things had changed enough in our town that there were more career options than “mine worker” or “general store cashier”. I ended up using my degree to manage a small accounting firm not too far from my parent’s house, and when my mom passed on back in ‘96, we inherited my childhood home.

I wish I could say my life was just one big happy success story, but that just ain’t realistic. Eventually, the mine shut down, and half the town lost their source of income. Businesses closed, not many people needed accounting managers around here, and suddenly I found myself out of a job too. I took a position managing a local hardware store instead, and while money was tighter than it used to be, Henrietta and I managed to survive. 

It didn’t help that my heart was getting worse. Every passing year it was a little harder to walk up the stairs to our bedroom, and every year the doctor’s visits became more and more frequent. 

“Martin, honey, I wish you’d consider moving. You could be so much happier at a job in another town, and it’d be so much easier to get you care when you’d need it”, Henrietta said to me from behind her coffee one morning.

I lowered my magazine and looked at her. It wasn’t the first time we’d had this conversation. I had to admit she’d made many compelling appeals, but this was out home. 

“Everyone and everything we know is here, Hen,” I sighed. 

“Because they’re stuck here, Martin. They have mortgages to pay off, and kids that need feedin’, and jobs that they’re happy with. We don’t have any of those things. We’re free to go, to build the life you’d planned for.”

It wasn’t the first time she’d said something to that point, but every time I heard it, it softened my stiff heart just a little to the idea.

“We’ll see. Next year, maybe.”

It was five years later, in that same home, that my wife passed on. Blood cancer. Sometimes, a place can take everything you have, and find a way to take more.

It was about a year ago when I’d resigned myself to let my body give up on me, to let my weak heart strangle me whenever it saw fit. A transplant was nearly out of the question- my folks had both come from out of state, and there weren’t many people dying nearby with AB-negative blood. 

I decided to skip my yearly checkup, and Dr. Hill, who’d semi-retired to my home town but still helped out when needed, personally called me up at my job to ask me to reconsider. He’d overseen my condition since I was a boy, and we’d grown to be friends as we’d aged. 

“Martin, if you don’t come in, I can’t guarantee you have long left. Your heart is manageable, but you need medication and care.”

“What if that’s not what I want anymore, Pete? What if I’m ready to go?” I’ll admit- it had been a dark time in my life, and I WAS ready. I missed my wife, and I’d hoped she’d be waiting for me.

“Martin, that’s not what Henrietta would want. You know that as well as I do.”

His words stung. He was absolutely right, too, but of course I wasn’t ready to hear it. I hung up, and went back to work. People weren’t going to cut their own plywood.

-

It wasn’t until about six months ago that a miracle happened, at least a miracle for me. 

I received the phone call at 2:39 AM on July the 5th. I’d only just managed to fall asleep after a night of watching the neighbor’s kids try their best to light fireworks in the pouring rain.

I groggily answered the phone. Dr. Hill’s voice greeted me, simultaneously somber and excited- as though he were ashamed to be happy about something.

“Martin, we’re- we’ve got some news. There was an accident in town- some biker from out of state. He was passing through tonight and well… the rain, it, well… he’s brain dead, Martin. But his heart… he’d be a match for you.”

I had my boots on by the time he said the man was brain dead. 

-

The town clinic was small. Not quite just a doctor’s office anymore, but a far cry from a complete hospital. Still, though, they had a morgue, and a surgery room, usually for tonsil removals or appendectomies. 

Dr. Hill greeted me at the front door and took my umbrella. He explained to me that they couldn’t keep the heart viable for long and there was no way to get a helicopter in through this storm to take us to a more well-equipped facility, so the surgery would have to be tonight, here. I asked him if I could thank the man who’d be giving me a second chance. He explained again that the man was brain dead, but it was more a symbolic gesture for me anyways.

He took me to the room where the man’s empty body laid. He was a muscular man, maybe in his late 50’s or so. Lanky. Long graying auburn hair hung from his head, partially caked in drying blood. His dark complexion, tanned from years of exposure to the elements, was paling and quickly yellowing seemingly before my very eyes. Breathing tubes and an oxygen mask obscured the man’s face, but I could make out long, braided beard. 

The man was covered in tattoos. Torn and bloodied skin hid detail from me, but the dark and faded markings on his skin wove a tapestry of artwork- none of the symbols or designs recognizable to me. There was only one single tattoo that remained unobscured and undamaged, located squarely on his right forearm. It was striking- a spiraling serpent, devouring its own tail. Ouroboros, I think it’s called.

His body was mangled- broken limbs that at this point weren’t worth casting, bleeding wounds that had been haphazardly wrapped just to keep the hospital bed clean. It was saddening to look at. A man, still technically alive, but given up on, for my sake. 

“His name is Marcus Rayne,” Dr. Hill startled me with his interjection. “He’s from Dallas. I called his emergency contact, apparently his wife, or ex-wife, or something. She says he left home about six months ago, hasn’t been himself in a while. Not many people left to miss him anymore. Damn shame, too- he was donated a kidney last year and barely got a chance to try it out,” Dr. Hill chuckled, until I cut him a disapproving look. He recomposed himself for a moment. “He must’ve been moved by the gesture. Registered himself as an organ donor a week after his operation. ‘Pass it on’, that kind of thing.”

I softly placed my weathered hand over Marcus’s for a moment and whispered a silent thank you as Dr. Hill began to prepare for surgery.

-

I woke up the following evening. There was no ICU at the clinic, so Dr. Hill had called up a few colleagues to come and help ensure my post-operation went smoothly. They gradually eased me off of my medications, and within a few days, Dr. Hill was driving me back home.

“Now you remember to stop taking your old medication, it’ll interfere with the success of the transplant” he chided. “And take it easy for as long as you can. Let Damien or one of the other clerks saw the two-by-fours at the shop, and absolutely no heavy lifting. Marcus’ heart was healthy, but there was some minor scarring that could be an issue if you don’t let it rest for at least a few months.”

I reassured Dr. Hill that I’d take good care of myself, but secretly, I was only excited to have a second chance at a normal life. I could eventually start exercising again, I could travel, I might even pick up hiking. 

Dr. Hill dropped me off at home, but not before once again warning me about the symptoms I could expect in the weeks post-op. Fever, fatigue, chest pain, all supposed to be completely normal. I reminded him that those were things I’d lived with my entire life, and thanked him again before he helped me wheel inside.

It was only a week or so before I was comfortable enough to stand again, and not too long after that that I held a barbecue to celebrate my recovery. I invited the whole neighborhood, and of course the entire local medical team, who had performed such a miraculous surgery. I bought a new grill from my store, and spent the entire weekend doing yard work and preparing my home for guests.

Dr. Hill was one of the last to arrive, and sternly discouraged me from doing any more manual labor, and reminded me that I wasn’t even supposed to be eating red meat because of my blood pressure. As I served him his plate, I shrugged him off and told him that I felt completely fine, and that I just felt like eating steak.

-

It was about a month post-operation that the complications first began. I had indeed started hiking as I’d planned to, and I had never felt more refreshed, until one afternoon. I had hardly begun my first uphill stretch, when I felt a sharp pain in my chest. It wasn’t the typical dull tightness I’d been used to all my life, but a stinging jab that overcame me for just a moment before subsiding.

I called Dr. Hill once again, and he begrudgingly reminded me that he was technically retired, and that if I was going to continue to ignore his medical advice anyways, I should call up the local clinic instead. That stung a bit, but once again, it’s not as though he were wrong.

I checked myself into our town’s clinic, and a young doctor greeted me and sat me down for my appointment. I explained to her my recent chest pain and the advice that Dr. Hill had given me, and she patiently explained to me that chest pain was entirely normal post-operation, even as far out as months after the transplant. She urged me to listen to the advice I was being given and take as much time as I could to relax. How could I begin to explain to her that I’d had to relax my entire life, and I finally felt like I had the energy to live?

I thanked her, begrudgingly paid my copay for the visit, and set off towards home. It was less than a week before the urge to be more active again finally overcame my will, and I began to hike again. 

The chest pain returned every few days. Never lasting more than a few seconds or a minute at most, I was completely fine with momentary discomfort. After all, I still had breath in my lungs and energy to spare . This new heart was just settling in, I told myself. After all, it was supplying a whole new body with a lifetime of energy that had been stolen from it.

It was two months post-operation that the varicose veins appeared. I’m not exactly a spring chicken, but I didn’t think it was normal for those to appear quite so soon, or so suddenly.

I decided that it would be best if I avoided the doctor entirely for this one. I pulled out my old work laptop and booted up my Internet connection, and googled something for the first time since my wife’s doctor told us she had “myelodysplasia”.

Search results indicated about what I’d expected- varicose veins can appear due to stress, aging, and high blood pressure. That had to be it- my new heart beat with a vitality and strength that my circulatory system just needed time to adjust to.

I excitedly laced up my hiking boots, and left on my next trip up the mountain. I remember making it just past the out-jutted rock you could see from my backyard, when I must’ve blacked out.

-

I woke up in a hospital that I didn’t recognize, surrounded by doctors I didn’t know and hooked up to equipment I’d never seen before.

They explained to me that I’d collapsed on the hiking trail and had been found a few hours later by a local jogger who had gotten me help. I had been moved to a hospital in a larger city a couple hours away, as it was determined that the local clinic was unable to properly assess me. I was badly sunburnt and very dehydrated, but what concerned the doctors the most were my scan results.

They showed me a few graphs, some charts, and finally my scan images, and I had a hard time making out what I was seeing. The doctors explained to me that what had initially been interpreted as scar tissue by Dr. Hill on my new heart was in fact an aggressive form of cancer. “Hemangiosarcoma”, they guessed- a cancer of the blood vessels that had apparently gone undiagnosed in Marcus before his death. It had metastasized in me, and begun to spread through my circulatory system. 

The doctors explained to me that my chest pains and my varicose veins were all early warning signs that could have been detected if I’d been taken to a “competent” facility sooner. They gave me about 5 months to live, and sent me on my way.

Dr. Hill seemed a little overly smug as he picked me up from the hospital.

“You know I used to work here. It’s where I first diagnosed your heart issue when you were a boy.”

I shrugged, not enthused to endure his “I told you so” old-man smugness on the 2 hour drive home.

“Jesus, Martin, why is it so hard for you to listen to me? You’ve never been like this. You should never have started hiking, you shouldn’t have gone back to work so soon, and you certainly shouldn’t be eating so much red meat. The doctors in there told me that as they were wheeling you in you vomited a half pound of pork sausage. What the hell has gotten into you?”

Who was he to scold me like that? He may be 20 years my senior but he sure as hell wasn’t my father, or my minister. Hell, he wasn’t even my doctor anymore.

I spat back at him, “If I hadn’t gone hiking in the first place, they probably never would’ve found the cancer that YOU missed. The cancer that you put into MY body, Peter.”

The car ride was crushingly silent on the way home. My anger towards him bubbled inside, and I silently enjoyed the sensation of my blood boiling- an emotional luxury my old heart never could have afforded. I felt a hotter anger than I had ever experienced before.

He dropped me off at home, and snidely said to me as I exited the car “if I hear you keep acting like this, I won’t be there next time to pick you back up.”

I was going to ignore it, and I began to walk back inside, when I heard something. A small, quiet voice, in the back of my head. “No one gets to talk to me like that.”

I was only taken aback by this sudden inner monologue  for a moment before I instinctively agreed with it. I turned around and ran back to Dr. Hill’s car. He was starting to drive away when I reached it, and I furiously banged on his window. He stopped his car, rolled the window down, and looked at me like I was insane while he began to ask me what the hell I was doing. 

I swiftly interrupted him, “Who the hell do you think you are Peter? No one gets to talk to me like that, no one. Especially a washed up retired surgeon who can’t even identify a tumor growing on a heart when he sees it. I’ll keep doing whatever the hell I want with the rest of my life, especially as short as it’s going to be. To be honest Pete, I haven’t needed you in a long time, so don’t count on me ever needing you again.”

I took a second to steady myself. My body froze in response to the gust of fury that had unexpectedly left me- long enough for him to notice that my burst of anger only thinly masked the fear I felt.

“You’re not yourself, Martin,” he said to me. “Get inside, and clean yourself up for God’s sake, you look homeless. Henrietta would be ashamed if she could see you now.”

Peter Hill drove off without another word, and it was the last time him and I ever spoke to each other.

I stared at my gravel driveway, unable to move since my tirade. I couldn’t believe what I’d done- in one fell swoop, I’d personally guaranteed that the one remaining friend I had was out of my life for my final months.

When I finally found the courage to regain my composure, I trudged towards my house. For the first time in a while, it loomed over me like a disappointing parent, and I felt weak and shameful, like I had in my youth. 

-

I took a look at myself in the mirror that night, a long and hard look. The doctors explained that I’d been badly sunburnt but now I could see it for myself- my skin appeared dark and leathery, as though I’d been outside for weeks. Peter was right, I had let my once clean shaven face become scruffy and unkempt. The hairs that had begun to sprout from my face were unkempt and bristly, unlike the neat and thin hair l had been accustomed to shaving daily.

The varicose veins sprawled under my skin, ever darker and blacker than when I had left for my hike early that morning. They had started to extend further too, now twisting and spiraling across my arms, culminating in clusters that washed my skin with mottled darkness.

It wasn’t until I looked at my right arm that I noticed a group of them clumped together in an unnatural shape, darker and neater than the rest of my veins. Distinctly circular and neatly positioned below my wrist, the image of an Ouroboros tattoo marked on a dead man flashed in my mind before I put the ridiculousness of the notion aside.

I shaved my face, took a much needed shower and applied some aloe cream to my burnt skin, then drifted off into a restless sleep.

-

I was awoken the next morning to a chest pain far sharper than any I’d previously encountered. I staggered out of bed, my chest pulsing and sweat dripping from my forehead. This certainly wasn’t normal- the cancer must be becoming more rapid, the spread more aggressive. I trudged to the restroom and found to my discouragement that the veins had grown darker and more distinct around my body, the circular cluster on my arm ever more resembling a tattoo.

I filled a glass with tap water, and began to take the variety of prescriptions that the doctors at Ivy Presbyterian had given to me. As I raised my hand to swallow the pills, a gruff voice once again whispered to me in my head, my own inner monologue given a tangible voice to hear.

“Don’t take those- you’ll kill me.”

I stopped for a moment, and looked at the pills in my hand. The doctors knew I was going to die anyways, why should I trust that these pills were going to help me in the slightest? Of course they wouldn’t, all they’d do is slow the cancer and prolong my suffering.

I tossed the pills in the toilet, and began to get dressed for my day.

The pain in my chest had begun to subside as I pulled into the parking lot of the hardware store, and as I stepped out of my pickup a cool breeze shot through my hair, and a nostalgic feeling shot through my blood like an icy warmth. 

As I began my shift, the teenagers who worked for me were flirting behind the counter, stocking the vending machine, or assisting the early riser customers. Each and every one of them stopped to stare at me as I entered. 

I knew that I had begun to look worse for wear, but when the acne-ridden kids with nose rings and green hair are looking at you like YOU’RE the oddball, you start to get the feeling enough is enough.

I barked at them to get back to work, and they hastily turned to resume their duties. It was rare I lost my temper with them, and they knew to listen. 

My shift trudged on ever slower. My chest felt tight throughout the day, sore and aching, as the veins around my body twisted and mottled my skin. I left work early to go home and get some rest, but I knew that sleep would not find me easily.

By the time I finally made it home, I could feel the foreign heart in my chest pounding against my rib cage. I couldn’t help feeling like Marcus’s heart was pumping cancer throughout my body with all the effort it could muster. The image of a moldy sponge being squeezed into a bucket came into my mind. 

As my head became woozy, I hastily undressed, and as I flung off my jeans, my wallet fell out of my pocket. Poking out the top of it was a pristine organ donor card I didn’t remember putting in there. The terrible writhing working its way through my body compelled me to put off investigating it until the morning, and I made my way to my room.

I collapsed into bed in a cold sweat, and the small nagging voice in my head whispered to me once more. 

“Sleep, Martin. We’ll be alright in the morning.”

-

For the next three months, my body became a stranger to me. The dark veins that had first appeared as faint, wriggling streaks now sprawled across my skin in intricate, angular patterns. They didn’t just grow; they etched themselves, deep and deliberate, into shapes that seemed almost purposeful. My arm bore the clearest mark—a perfect Ouroboros, coiled and unbroken, the black veins so thick they rose under my skin like cords straining against a taut surface.

My skin had toughened, as though it had been stretched too far and then left out to dry. It wasn’t just leathery—it was unnatural. It didn’t even feel like skin anymore.

The changes didn’t stop. My beard, once sparse and graying, grew back wild and rough, its deep auburn hue swallowing the gray. My hairline, long receded, seemed to march forward, strands of that same unfamiliar auburn forcing their way through the silver-black. I stopped looking in the mirror altogether—it only made me feel more alien in my own skin.

And then came the growing pains.

It began with an ache, sharp and deep, shooting through my arms and legs in the middle of the night. I thought it might be my joints, or some side effect of my failing body, but then I noticed my clothes—shirts pulling tight across my chest, my jeans creeping higher up my ankles. At first, I told myself it was swelling, or water retention, or literally anything but the obvious truth.

By the time I finally measured myself, I had grown nearly three inches taller. My limbs stretched as though my bones were being pulled apart, slowly, deliberately. My joints ached constantly, my body struggling to keep up with the unrelenting rhythm of a heart that wasn’t mine. My spine hunched, vertebrae protruding far further from my back than they should. 

But nothing compared to the pain in my chest.

It was more than pressure or tightness—it was movement. I could FEEL it, something burrowing deeper into me, snaking through my organs, wrapping around my ribs, anchoring itself to my bones. The pain would come in waves, sharp and searing, leaving me gasping for breath.

One night, it was so bad it woke me from a dreamless sleep. I stumbled out of bed, clutching my chest, and caught sight of myself in the mirror. My ribs were heaving, my skin stretched so tight I could see the faint ripple of movement beneath it.

My hand flew to my chest. For a horrifying moment, I swore I felt it—the heart, shifting, repositioning itself like a living thing searching for a better grip. I doubled over, gagging, and in the midst of the pain, I heard the voice again.

“Relax. Let it happen.”

It was louder now, more distinct. Not just a whisper in the back of my mind, but something tangible, something there. It wasn’t my voice, and it sure as hell wasn’t mine to control.

The impossible, terrible idea that it was Marcus growing inside of me had gnawed at my mind for a while. Every day the thought became harder and harder to push back, and instead it slowly became accepted as an absolute truth. Somehow, some way, he was still alive in me. 

The idea haunted me, gnawing at me during every quiet moment I had. It wasn’t just the voice—the low, gravelly whisper that urged me to give into my darker instincts—but the sensations, the impulses. Little things at first, easy to dismiss.

Then, there were the memories. Flashes of images that didn’t belong to me—desert skies stretching into infinity, the sting of wind against my face. I saw flashes of burning forests, endless rows of trees that seemed to writhe in the flame. One night, I caught myself humming a tune I didn’t recognize, some twangy country dirge that felt as foreign as the veins twisting under my skin.

How much of me was still me? How much had been overwritten?

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was the stress or medication. Maybe it was my own body trying to adapt to the transplant, my brain cobbling together fragments of identity to make sense of the changes. But the more I tried to explain it, the less it made sense.

The voice grew louder when I resisted. I’d reach for my pills, and it would hiss at me, sharp and insistent: “Don’t take those. They’ll kill me.”

“Me.”

Not “you.”

It wasn’t just the voice, either. My body resisted. The pills felt foreign in my hand, their edges sharp against my palm. My throat tightened when I tried to swallow them, as though I were choking on something too large. When I finally forced them down, I felt sick for hours—nauseous and weak, washed with shame as though I’d done something wrong.

And yet, when I skipped a dose, my strength returned. My legs felt steady, my pulse strong. I’d look in the mirror and see the changes—muscles I hadn’t ever had, a flush of sickening rosy color in my cheeks. But it wasn’t my strength. It wasn’t my color. 

“Let it happen,” the voice would whisper in those rare moments I let my gaze linger on the mirror. “It’s who you are now.”

Was it? Was this who I was? Or was I just becoming someone else?

I started avoiding people. The teenagers at the hardware store had begun to look at me differently, their conversations faltering when I entered the room. I caught Mrs. Delaney, my neighbor of thirty years, staring at me through her kitchen window, her face pale and drawn. I hadn’t said a word to her, but she flinched when our eyes met.

Dr. Hill had noticed it before anyone else had. That last time we spoke, when he drove me home from the hospital, he looked at me with a strange mix of pity and fear. “You’re not yourself, Martin,” he had said. And he was right. 

I was losing pieces of myself, little by little, every day. The way I walked, the way I talked, the way I thought—it was all shifting, tilting toward something I didn’t recognize.

I wanted to fight it. I wanted to believe I could stop it. But every time I tried, the voice was there, whispering, coaxing, reminding me of the truth I didn’t want to face:

Whatever was growing inside me wasn’t a foreign body- it was part of me. 

I needed answers.

Last month, desperate for anything to make sense, I hired a private investigator to dig into Marcus’s life. His online presence was sparse, and the few photos I managed to find of him didn’t match the man I’d seen on the hospital bed. Still, I scraped together what I could and sent it off, along with a chunk of my savings.

Two weeks later, the investigator sent me a file.

Marcus Rayne wasn’t a long-time biker. He wasn’t a gang member. He wasn’t any of the things I’d assumed from his appearance that night at the clinic. He was a quiet man, a pencil pusher at an insurance company. A family man. He had been in the late stages of kidney failure when a donor miraculously appeared: an AB-negative match.

The donor had been found washed up by a nearby river, nearly drowned and brain-dead, with an organ donor card in his wallet. The transplant was immediate. Routine, the file said. Unremarkable.

But what followed wasn’t.

The investigator’s notes were sparse, but damning. Marcus’s wife claimed he started changing after the surgery—small things at first. New habits. New preferences. A new temper. He began making reckless decisions, abandoning the quiet stability of his life. A minivan traded for a motorcycle. Tattoos that seemed to appear overnight.

And then the violence.

By the time his wife filed a restraining order, Marcus was unrecognizable—not just in his actions, but in his appearance. The file included photos of his “tattoos”. They were detailed, angular, almost artistic in their precision, but upon closer inspection, I was mistaken- they weren’t tattoos at all. They were dark, mottled veins that rooted themselves under his skin. And they matched the ones now growing on my own skin, vein by vein, line by line.

I stared at the photos for hours, trying to make sense of it. Trying to feel something that wasn’t dread.

There is something growing inside me, and it isn’t Marcus.

I’ve stopped fighting it—I don’t think I can anymore. My body isn’t mine. My reflection isn’t mine. Even my thoughts feel… foreign.

Day by day, I can feel it spreading. My skin stretches to keep up with the changes, my muscles twist to accommodate my growing frame. Beneath my hair, thick and auburn, I feel bony bumps forming, hard and sharp, pushing against my skull.

If anyone finds my body, please, I do not give consent for my organs to be donated. I keep taking the stupid card out of my wallet, but whenever I leave home, a new one appears in my pocket anyway. Putting this online seems to be the only way to get this warning out as quickly as possible.

The Devil is growing in me, I know it. I’ve never been afraid to die. It’s always been on the horizon for me, and I know I’ll be with my Henrietta. I just hope she still recognizes me.

I am Brazilian and do not speak English very well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.

I have been researching walkie talkies/radios for a few days now. I am aware that certain types of radios require a license for amateur radio operation, etc., but my situation is as follows. I live in the countryside, a mountainous region, and I work with coffee farming. I have a farm where there is no phone signal, no internet network nearby, and no electricity. This farm is 3 km (1,85 miles) away from another farm which is the ""headquarters"" of the work activities, and I need a means of communication between these two farms. There have been situations of work accidents, and since it is uncommunicable, it has been very difficult to notify someone and get help. So I understand that even if it is not 100% correct to use this means of communication, it is literally the only possibility we have to not run as much risk as we have been running. I think the simpler ones up to 0.5w would not be enough, after all, as I said, it is 3 km away in a mountainous region. Here it is a city of 10,000 inhabitants, where I believe there is not much use of radio. I have heard that the employees of the municipal works department use it for the same reason, because when they go to do services in the interior regions of the municipality, they become uncommunicable.

So I would like suggestions on which device would be suitable for this use. Watching some videos and reports on the internet, I found several options ranging from R$ 100 to R$ 300. These are Baofeng BF 1909, UV 17 Pro V2, UV 17, UV 5R, 777S, 888S, Retevis RT 86, and Quansheng Uv K5. I saw that among these, some are stronger, with different battery capacities, etc., but I would like the opinion of those who already use them on which is the most suitable for the situation I live in.

After I manage to install electricity at the farm, I plan to install a Starlink. However, until then, I think the only way would be through walkie talkies.

Thank you in advance.",1,1737005462.0,Retevis,0,1.0,False

1i2hx08,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/1i2hx08/why_you_should_care_about_housing_affordability/,Why you should care about housing affordability in Canada if you are a homeowner (even a selfish one),"**TLDR – High housing costs will get passed onto the general public in the longer term either directly through increased prices for goods and services, increased taxes, and/or the degradation of the quality of living in Canada due to lack of workers available to provide goods/services. Either scenario will stifle future economic growth as well as decrease the desirability of living in Canada in various ways. The issue will eventually come full circle with high housing prices being the root cause of a future decline in demand for Canadian real estate, and therefore, a decline in value/price of Canadian real estate.**

It’s common knowledge that the majority of Canadians are homeowners and therefore, the recent escalation of real estate prices across the country has increased the wealth of the majority of Canadians. As a result, many people may come to the conclusion that the escalation of Canadian real estate prices is a good thing for Canada as a whole as it increases the collective wealth of its citizens. Although I understand why your average Canadian homeowner might think this, I think it is short sighted and ignores the bigger picture negative impact that unaffordable home prices will have on the country as a whole over the longer term (future decades).  

Some existing homeowners (myself included) do care about the general wellbeing of Canadians and want housing to be affordable for everyone even if that means a reduction in the value of their own home. However, my impression is that this group is a small minority. Obviously it’s not hard to understand why a large portion of the home owning population would want to maintain or increase the value of their home as there is an obvious immediate personal benefit. The bigger picture negative consequences are much less obvious and will play out slowly but surely over a much longer period of time. It’s not surprising that your average person would much more enticed by the immediate benefits while ignoring (or being oblivious to) the longer term costs. However, I would argue that those longer term costs outweigh the immediate benefits for the vast majority of the home owning population as I think unaffordable housing poses an existential threat to the future of Canada if it isn’t addressed in a meaningful way in the not too distant future. The issue is most apparent in Toronto and Vancouver but it pretty much applies across the country to varying extents. What I describe below is most applicable to Vancouver and Toronto but also applies to the remainder of the country, although to a lesser extent.

The primary reason why existing homeowners should care about housing affordability is that the high cost of housing will personally impact them, both financially and non-financially over the long run. The reason for this is - in order to function properly, a city/region needs a substantial amount of people who work jobs that don’t pay significant wages (the “working class”) but are critical for it to function properly. For example – teachers, nurses, paramedics, firefighters, police, construction workers, garbage collection workers, infrastructure maintenance workers, bus drivers, farm workers (and everyone else involved in the food supply chain), restaurant workers, retail workers, truck drivers, and so on. So what happens when wages for these jobs are so disconnected from the local cost of housing that these types of people simply just can’t find a place that they can afford to live in? There are two primary consequences:

1. Significant reduction in the workforce - People will leave and move to a place where the wage they earn in that new location will allow them to afford a place to live there.
2. Wage increases - For those who choose to remain in HCOL areas, wages will increase to a level where these workers can afford to live there.

These consequences will not be fully felt immediately, but rather, will become increasingly pronounced as time goes on. The likely result will be a combination of the two – some people will leave and will move to a place where they can afford to live and the people who stay will see their wages rise. We have already started to experience these effects but we are still in the beginning stages of what will become a much more significant issue further down the road. So why should a homeowner care about this (even if they are selfish and are only worried about their own needs)? Canadians as a whole will ultimately bear the cost because:

1. Significant reduction in the workforce
   1. If there aren’t enough people to staff all the critical working class jobs in a city, this will decrease the availability and quality of goods and services available in the region. A prime example of this is the current doctor shortage in Canada – look at the portion of the population that doesn’t have a GP and has to rely on walk-in clinics or going to the ER. Look at how long it takes to get an MRI or an appointment at a specialist (often over a year). Or imagine needing an ambulance only to find out that paramedics are understaffed and you aren’t their top priority. The general degradation of services in HCOL areas will obviously negatively impact local residents, which includes wealthy homeowners.
   2. Without an adequate local workforce, businesses will shut down or move to a location where they have a better labour pool. People will also be resistant to starting new businesses since they know they will have significant challenges with labour availability and cost. This will further weaken our already struggling economy.
   3. Another less obvious way that the workforce will decline in the longer term is that younger people will stop having kids. The birth rate in Canada is already very low and will continue to decline as young people can barely afford to get by themselves, let alone being able to afford children.

1. Wage increases
   1. In order for most businesses to be able to raise the wages of their employees, they must raise their prices, which ultimately just passes on the additional cost to the consumer. There seems to be a common misconception that businesses in general have huge profits and could simply just afford to increase wages to whatever level necessary. While this is true with certain highly profitable businesses/industries, it does not apply to the vast majority of businesses. I’m an accountant so I’ve gotten to see “behind the curtains” of many different businesses and you’d be surprised how many just breakeven or have a small profit/loss. Those types of businesses are much more common than the ones that are wildly profitable. This is due to basic economic forces – if a certain business/industry is making huge profits, that entices others to enter the industry, increasing competition, which decreases profits. Restaurants are a prime example of an industry with low margins as there are low barriers to entry – many have gone out of business in the recent years and think about how expensive that continue to operate have gotten, and how everyone is asking for 20%+ tips now as the norm. There’s a reduction in supply accompanied by an increase in cost.
   2. Any government related service, the general public will ultimately bear the increased cost via higher taxes. If we pay teachers, nurses, firefighters, police, city maintenance workers, public transit workers, etc. enough that they can afford to like in a HCOL city, that’s going to basically double all of their salaries.  Their increased salaries will ultimately be paid by the general public via increased taxes. Canada already has high enough taxes so raising them even further with have negative impacts that directly impact individuals and also have a broader negative impact on the economy.  

In short, further down the road you either won’t be able to order a pizza because there won’t be any people here to make it for you, or you’ll need to pay $75 for your pizza because the pizza shop needs to pay their employees $40/hour so that they can afford to live in the area. There will be less goods/services available and what’s available will cost significantly more. In summary, either Canadian society will fail to function properly because it won’t have workers to provide the essential goods and services or it will continue to function properly but with greatly increased costs. Obviously neither is a desirable outcome. Realistically, the result will be somewhere in the middle – a decline in the quality of goods and services accompanied by an increase in price.

Another major factor is that the divide between the rich and the poor will continue to increase, leading to social unrest. This is something that we’ve already started to see with crime increasing – look at all the stolen car stuff you see on the news from the GTA. IMO, part of what made Canada a great country in the past is that there wasn’t that big of difference between the rich and the poor. Most people were more or less in the same boat financially and this leads to a very peaceful society with low crime because the vast majority of the population has their basic needs taken care of and people aren’t acting out of desperation. Wealth inequality is a big risk that leads to social unrest and can destabilize what used to be a peaceful society. Brazil is a prime example of a country that is very dangerous because there is a big difference between the haves and the have nots. Historically this has also been a big difference between Canada and the US – the US has always had greater wealth inequality than Canada and has much greater crime as a result.

If Canadian society continues to head towards this downward spiral, what do you think will happen to the demand for people to live in Canada, and therefore, the demand for Canadian real estate? Ironically, the issue of unaffordable housing will eventually come full circle as high housing prices will eventually be the main cause of a reduction in housing prices further down the road.

Here are some preemptive responses to common rebuttals that I am sure some people will bring up in the comments:

* “There are plenty of super expensive cities in the world that operate totally fine. The lower class workers just commute into town from the surrounding areas that are more affordable.” - Using Vancouver (where I live) as an example as the issue is most acute here (with Toronto being a close second) – Vancouver is unique from most other expensive cities in that the surrounding suburbs are still very expensive and we also don’t have sufficient infrastructure (roads & public transportation) to efficiently move large amounts of people from the surrounding areas to their jobs in the city. NYC for example – the prime areas are way more expensive than Toronto or Vancouver but the metro region is huge and there are drastically cheaper areas that are a relatively short train ride away. If you don’t believe me, look up real estate prices in Yonkers, Queens, The Bronx, Jersey City, Newark, etc. In Vancouver, a half decent house in the core goes for like $2.5M but for some reason a house an hour away in Langley is still $1.5M and two hours away in Chilliwack it’s still $1M. And there isn’t even sufficient public transit to efficiently get you into your Vancouver job from those places anyways. So where the heck is someone who works at a coffee shop in downtown Vancouver supposed to live?  
* “We’ll keep importing cheap foreign labour” - I think it’s pretty clear by now that this strategy that Canada has been using has significant negative consequences and is not sustainable. In addition to the various negative impacts that Canadians have felt, the foreign workers themselves won’t want to come here anymore as their standard of living in far below what it used to be.
* “Canada is very desirable and wealthy people will always want to live here” – This has been the case in Canada historically, however, I would argue that a significant factor that many people don’t realize about is that high housing prices also impact high earners as well. Imagine a young person in med school – yes, they can afford a detached house in Vancouver but did they really go to med school so that they can eventually afford to buy a $2M old bungalow? At every price level, what you get for that price level sucks.
* “They won’t be able to buy but they can just rent for life” – Although I mostly refer to buying a house/condo, what I am saying applies to both renting and buying. Obviously there is a close correlation between buying costs and renting costs, as they are essentially substitutes for each other and the landlords who own the rental properties are looking to recover the high cost that they paid to buy the rental property. You can’t have really expensive real estate to buy and also have cheap rent in the same market – that just doesn’t make sense. Renting has historically been cheaper than buying but current rent prices are still very high and disconnected from local incomes.
* “Most young people are going to inherit a bunch of money from their wealthy homeowning parents” – Firstly, although there are a considerable amount of rich baby boomers who will pass their wealth down to their kids, this is still a relative small privileged group in the grand scheme of the country. More importantly – even if people have rich parents, inheritance usually comes later in life, not at the age when you really need it where you are buying your first home and trying to start a family. The average life expectancy in Canada is around 80, so most people will receive their inheritance when their parents die and they are in their 60’s. You don’t need a bunch of money to buy a house when you are 60 – you need it when you are 30.

At some point we talked about the internal voices we ""hear"" that go on and on and cause problems for us because of how intrusive they are.  Hers is expressed differently from mine (not sure if she'd be fine with me sharing so I won't) but mine is like this voice telling me how terrible and bad I am at everything, or how horrible everyone else or the world is.  It's relentless once it starts going and can endure for weeks or months.

1i2hrvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1i2hrvt/article_how_to_save_money/,[Article] How to save money,"Skills addressed: Spending and saving money.

One of the best things about money is that you choose how to spend it. It’s difficult to label any spending choice inherently wrong. Even buying a 50-foot Santa Claus statue could be wise if it brings you enough joy. If you think of money in terms of how it impacts the quality of your life, though, you can optimize and improve how you spend.

**Saving**

To spend less, we suggest considering almost nothing essential. Even necessary products don’t need to be the latest model or the priciest brand.

The more something costs, the more time you should spend considering it. Most people should first focus on larger repeated costs, such as internet, accommodation, utilities, phone, and car costs.

Next, consider if you can save money by:

* Buying second hand
* Buying for practicality (Ignoring aesthetics, ease of use to some degree, and branding)

Most financial decisions are repetitive and only need to be made consciously once. Even a seemingly minor repeated expense like coffee should be treated with importance. David Bach’s book, *The Latte Factor*, discusses this idea.

**What spending should you protect?**

Unless your situation is truly desperate, there are some costs you shouldn’t remove entirely. Internet access is effectively unlimited education, although this only applies if you use it for this purpose. Similarly, if the quality of extremely commonly used items such as shoes, bedding, or toothbrushes differs significantly, it can be worth spending more.

Purchases that save large amounts of time should also be protected, especially if you will use the time saved to work more, apply for new work, or study something that may make money.

**How do I avoid compulsive spending?**

At its worst, compulsive spending is a self-sabotaging behavior with a lot in common with drug use, gambling, or overeating. The solutions to all of these are similar.

1. Acknowledge you have a problem.
2. Seek help if needed (you never need to face addiction alone). There are numerous charities that can help.
3. Note that the solution is largely your mindset. If your mindset doesn’t change, your habits are very unlikely to, either. If your reasons for not overspending are not strong enough, you will likely continue to spend.
4. If you have a long-term partner who shares finances, discuss spending with them. If they do not share your problem, they should be able to help you with accountability.
5. Make rules

In the case of overspending, you only need one rule: stick to your priorities. You also, of course, need to know what these are. To do this

1. List items you commonly buy or want to buy, including aspirational items
2. Quickly mark any you will definitely do or will definitely not do. There is no need to prioritize these.
3. Prioritize those that remain.

If you buy something you rate as less important, don’t get mad at yourself. Self-recrimination can trigger a destructive cycle where you get depressed and follow a likely conditioned response to this by spending more. Instead, ask yourself why you broke your rule and resolve not to do it again.

If the same rule is broken repeatedly, a new solution is needed. If you spend when drunk, for example, the solution is likely not to exercise more discipline; it is to not get drunk. Again, this solution may be to seek help.

Prioritization works because one of the best ways to stop yourself from spending is to know what you are giving up.

**Valuing time**

Valuing your time highly is advisable because personal development can rapidly increase your earnings. Purchases that save large amounts of time should also be protected, especially if you will use the time saved to work more or study something that may earn you money. This brings us to the value of your time.

We believe valuing your time at your hourly salary is, in most cases, severely flawed. Your time’s value depends on what you would otherwise do and how urgently you need money.

We recommend that you value your time above your current hourly salary in almost all cases and, in some cases, dramatically above. This doesn’t mean you should quit your job; money can be critically important in the short term.

One effective way to protect your time is to hire people for tasks you dislike, aren’t good at, or are indifferent toward. Cleaners, chefs (especially those who deliver meals), drivers, and virtual assistants are often undervalued or wrongly dismissed as impractical.

**Savings**

Once earning more than you spend, most financial books recommend the following priorities:

Firstly, Building a short-term emergency fund of about 3 months’ salary or paying off costly debts (such as credit cards)

Secondly, in most countries switching from renting to owning property. This is conditional and generally involves you planning to stay in the same location. You also may want to invest money while you save up to do this if the purchase is a long way off.

Finally, investing. Investing is advised once your expected rate of return is greater than your debt. Commonly advised areas to invest in are rental property (potentially more like a job), index funds (by far the easiest), or your own business.

**The basic rule of money is that to build wealth, you should aim to consistently spend less than what you earn.**

This rule comes with plenty of potential exceptions:

* You anticipate a significant increase in income due to completing a degree, an internship, or being between jobs.
* You anticipate decreased expenses, such as paying off your mortgage, paying for your children’s school fees, or covering essential needs like medical treatment.
* To invest in the future (starting a new business or paying for training)
* If you have more savings than you need (retirement).

**Resources**

* Scott Pape’s *The Barefoot Investor* is the best book on personal finance.
* David Bach’s *The Latte Factor* is great for those with debt.
* George S. Clason’s *The Richest Man in Babylon* is also great.

1i2hnz1,https://i.redd.it/1xu7pi1rhade1.jpeg,How does a motion logo differ from a static logo?," Static Logos Are the Grandpa Sweaters of Branding

Picture this: you’re at a party. Everyone’s mingling, laughing, showing off their moves, and there’s your static logo, standing awkwardly in the corner like, “Hey, I’m here too…”

Now, enter the motion logo—it’s not just in the party; it’s on the dancefloor, stealing the spotlight with a backflip and moonwalk combo. That, my friend, is the difference between static and motion logos.

A static logo is the dependable classic; a motion logo is the showstopper that gets all the attention. Let’s break it down before your brand gets stuck in the 2D world forever.


 “Static Logos: The Reliable, But Unexciting Sidekick”

Don’t get me wrong—static logos are great. They’re like that friend who always brings chips to the barbecue. Solid. Dependable. But are they memorable? Not really.

They sit there, looking all professional, but they don’t do anything. No sparkle, no pizzazz. It’s like going to a fancy restaurant and getting plain toast. Sure, it’s fine, but where’s the butter?


---

“Motion Logos: Your Brand’s Glow-Up Moment”

Now let’s talk about motion logos. Imagine your logo coming to life. The letters slide into place, the colors swirl, maybe a swoosh or a sparkle here and there. Suddenly, your brand isn’t just a thing—it’s an experience.

A motion logo screams, “Hey, I’m modern, I’m dynamic, and I’ve got my life together.” It’s like your logo just upgraded from a bicycle to a sports car.


---
 “Static Logos Are Billboards, Motion Logos Are Mini Movies”

Static logos are great for business cards, websites, and t-shirts. But motion logos? They belong in a cinematic universe.

They’re designed for today’s world, where people don’t read—they watch. Social media intros, video ads, even Netflix-worthy brand reveals—motion logos are like your brand’s elevator pitch with special effects.


---

“The ROI of Motion Logos: It’s Like Getting Champagne on a Beer Budget”

Here’s the kicker: motion logos aren’t just for big-budget brands like Disney or Nike. Even small businesses can afford the glow-up. And the ROI? Off the charts.

Think about it—when was the last time a static logo made you feel something? A motion logo, though? It sticks. It turns heads. It makes people say, “Wow, this brand has got it together.”


---

“Which One Is Right for You? Spoiler: Motion Logos Win”

Look, static logos still have their place. They’re classic, timeless, and easy to slap on a coffee mug. But if you want your brand to look modern, innovative, and downright cool, a motion logo is the way to go.

It’s like comparing a Polaroid to a TikTok video. One’s nostalgic; the other’s what people are actually watching.


---

Punchline: “Don’t Let Your Logo Be Static in a World That’s in Motion”

In a nutshell, static logos are fine—if your brand’s goal is to blend in. But if you’re here to stand out, capture attention, and maybe even break the internet, it’s time to get your logo moving.

So, what’ll it be? Grandpa sweater or party-starter? Toast or toast with butter?

The choice is yours, but remember—motion logos aren’t just the future. They’re the now. Let’s get moving!

My boss, Mr. J, is a nice guy but can be a little too particular about rules and routines. Today was one of those chaotic shifts where everything seemed to go wrong. The coffee machine broke down, we ran out of almond milk, and a customer yelled at me for getting their order wrong. By the end of my shift, I was beyond frustrated and just wanted to vent.

After clocking out I recorded a voice note for my bestfriend, ranting about my day. I complained about the entitled customer and even made a snarky comment about how Mr. J micromanages everything. It wasn't anything too cruel, but I definitely called him ""Control Freak"" at one point.

Here's where I messed up. I sent the voice note... but instead of sending it to my friend, I accidentally sent it to my boss. I don't know how I managed it, maybe it was my tired brain, or maybe I just didn't double check but as soon as I realized, I felt my stomach drop. 

I panicked and tried to delete it, but it was too late. Within minutes, I got a message back from him saying, ""I think you meant to send this to someone else?"" I was mortified. I apologized profusely, saying I was venting after a stressful day and didn't mean any disrespect. He hasn't responded yet, and I have no idea how he's going to handle this.

Now I'm dreading my next shift. I don't know if I should bring it up again or just hope he lets it slide.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to a cozy and inviting kitchen, every detail matters, and kitchen towels are no exception. A quality kitchen towel set can elevate your cooking experience while adding aesthetic charm to your space. This is where the ""home sweet home kitchen towels set"" comes into play. Selecting the right set is not just about functionality; it's also about creating a warm environment that reflects your personal style.

First and foremost, the quality of your kitchen towels is essential. High-quality towels offer better absorbency and longevity, making them a smart choice for daily kitchen tasks. Consider these benefits:

- **Durability:** Quality towels made from strong materials like cotton or linen withstand frequent washing without losing their softness or absorbent properties.
- **Absorbency:** A good towel set provides superior drying capabilities, helping you tackle spills and drying dishes more efficiently.
- **Non-toxic Materials:** Opting for kitchen towels made from organic or eco-friendly fabrics ensures that your food remains free from harmful chemicals.

Equally important is the design element of your home sweet home kitchen towels. Designs can range from classic checks to vibrant patterns, enabling you to express your personality. Here’s how design plays a significant role:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-sweet-home-kitchen-towels-set  
  
- **Style:** Towels with cheerful designs or colors can enhance the overall look of your kitchen. A cohesive color palette can create a harmonious atmosphere, making the space feel welcoming.
- **Themed Decor:** Whether you favor a farmhouse vibe or a modern aesthetic, the right towel set can complement your kitchen theme, helping to tie the room together.
- **Function and Design:** Some towels offer dual functionality with pockets or loops for hanging, merging practicality with appealing looks.

While quality and design are significant, you should also consider the practical aspects when selecting a home sweet home kitchen towels set. Here’s what to keep in mind:

1. **Size Matters:** Make sure to choose a variety of sizes. Larger towels can be great for drying dishes, while smaller ones are ideal for wiping hands or surfaces.
2. **Care Instructions:** Determine if the towels are machine washable and whether they resist stains. Easy-to-care-for towels save you time and keep your kitchen fresh.
3. **Pack Size:** Buying sets, rather than individual pieces, often provides excellent value. Look for multi-pack sets that allow for mix-and-match styles or colors.

Proper care and maintenance can extend the life of your home sweet home kitchen towels set. Here are some tips to keep them looking new:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-sweet-home-kitchen-towels-set  
  
- Wash your towels with mild detergent to maintain their color and texture.
- Avoid fabric softeners, as they can reduce absorbency over time.
- Dry on medium heat to prevent shrinking and maintain softness.

Home sweet home kitchen towels are more than just accessories; they are everyday essentials that contribute to the beauty and efficiency of your cooking space. Investing in a high-quality and stylish kitchen towel set can make your time in the kitchen feel more enjoyable. It’s an easy way to express your personality while ensuring you have the right tools at your fingertips.

All these elements work together to create a delightful cooking experience. Whether you’re drying your hands, wiping spills, or just adding a pop of color to your kitchen decor, the right kitchen towels are a simple yet effective way to enhance your home. Choose wisely, and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of your home sweet home kitchen.

Creative Ways to Incorporate Kitchen Towels in Home Decor

Kitchen towels are more than just practical items for drying dishes or wiping hands; they can also serve as charming design elements in your home. When you choose eye-catching patterns and colors, kitchen towels can enhance your overall decor while adding a cozy touch to the heart of your home. Here are some creative ideas to bring a fresh energy into your kitchen through the use of towels.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-sweet-home-kitchen-towels-set  
  
### Add a Pop of Color

One of the simplest ways to use kitchen towels in home decor is by selecting vibrant colors or unique patterns that stand out. Consider using towels in colors that match your kitchen's theme. For example, if you have a rustic farmhouse kitchen, opt for plaid or gingham-patterned towels in hues like red, navy, or cream.

### Display Them Artfully

Instead of hiding your kitchen towels in a drawer, display them openly. Here are a few options:

- **Hang on Hooks:** Install decorative hooks on the walls or the side of cabinets and hang your towels. This creates an instantaneous visual flair and easy access.
- **Use a Decorative Ladder:** A wooden ladder can be a stylish way to showcase multiple towels. Lean it against the wall and drape towels over its rungs for a relaxed, bohemian vibe.
- **Baskets and Containers:** Place rolled or folded kitchen towels in decorative baskets or containers on countertops. This creates an organized but charming display.

### Create a Gallery Wall

For those who love crafts, consider creating a gallery wall in your kitchen using towels as a focal point. Frame your favorite towels and mount them on the wall. Not only do they brighten the space, but they also serve as a unique conversation starter!

### Serve as Table Runner or Centerpiece

Transform kitchen towels into a functional table runner. Lay a long towel across your dining table to create a soft, inviting surface for meals. You may also use larger towels to create a visually appealing centerpiece by folding them artistically and placing decorative items or fresh flowers on top.

### Gift Wrapping

Use kitchen towels as practical and stylish gift wrap. Whether it’s for a housewarming party or a lovely holiday gift, wrapping items in a beautiful towel adds a touch of thoughtfulness. Pair the towel with kitchen gadgets or gourmet goodies for a delightful surprise.

### Seasonal Decor

Change your kitchen towels with the seasons to keep things fresh. Light, breezy towels with floral designs can be perfect for spring, while warm, cozy colors can reflect the autumn vibes. This small change can bring your kitchen to life throughout the year.

### Use as Pot Holders

While traditional pot holders can be bulky, using kitchen towels as improvised pot holders brings a rustic appeal. Just ensure the towels are thick enough to withstand the heat and always keep them in a visible spot for easy reach.

Fitbit shares your contact info and email usage data with advertisers. Strava gives away your precise location. Say a few days a week you leave your house, hit a nice trail nearby, stop for coffee and walk home. Anyone with access to that data knows exactly where you are. It’s happened to CIA agents, who have tracked down President Biden and others this way.

# Time to check your app permissions

* **On Android:** Head to **Settings** \> **Apps**, then pick the **app** you want to change and tap **Permissions**. You’ll see what the app can access. **Toggle off** any permissions you don’t want it to have.

Want to do a general sweep? Go to **Settings** \> **Apps**, hit the gear icon (top left), then tap **Configure Apps** \> **App permissions**.

* **On iPhone:** Open **Settings** \> **Privacy & Security**. Here, you’ll find what data your apps can see. Pick a category (like **Microphone**), and **toggle off** the apps you don’t want snooping.

✅ **Pro tip:** The **Location Services** feature lets you choose which apps can track you. Tap to set it to **Always**, **While Using the App** or **Never**.

Alt since I have friends on my main.

I (22 M) am thinking of breaking my lease early with my 2 friends (22f and 22m) after my friend's fiancé (21m) flipped out at me for ""not cleaning"". Let me preface with this. I already know I am the AH for one thing, which I will clarify on later, but the main issue is what I am just ticked off on. I like my friends but I think I'm seeing the writing on the wall and kinda want out early so I don't have to deal with it.

Clarity:

RM1 22M

RM2 22F

RM3 21M

Currently my school is on winter break, for Americans its around early December to early January, and because of that I have been gone for away from college and staying with my parents, about 2 hours away from campus. My roommate all stayed local for most of break which is where I think the issue is coming from. Today, seemingly out of the blue, one of my roommates, RM2, sent a message to our roomie chat concerned that I had left coffee stains on the kitchen counter. This is the part where I am definitely the AH. RM2 was, rightfully, pissed that it had been left since this has happened before. Obviously this was dickheaded of me and I should've cleaned it up, but RM2's fiancé, RM3, then levies a response to this, it's been a while and I have since left our chat, so i will paraphrase. ""OP you need to get your head out of your ass and act like an adult. For the last month I have been doing all the dishes, I need you to contribute to cleaning as it is all of our responsibility and you not helping pisses me off."" Thinking about this now I realize that he's pissed about, at least I think, that the dishes haven't been done by me over break? If this is true though that means he's mad about something I literally could not control. I have been back to our campus a total of 3 times since break started. This includes a couple of days ago when I went back to get some items I needed for my job that I had left back at school. I responded with the least emotion as possible as at this point I was seeing red after being confronted with something I thought was untrue and attacking me for seemingly no reason. Again paraphrasing, ""I'm sorry for stains, that was bad of me, however you leave piles of dishes in the sink every time I do clean up, and don't put away dishes on the drying rack when they're done."" His rebuttal was still pretty charged, basically summed up as calling me blind and not being able to read, as he does the dishes and is pissed that I haven't and need to contribute more. I am just exhausted and need to focus my energy elsewhere. This includes the thought that I'm having of breaking our lease early and moving out, as it come to my attention that my roommate's fiancé doesn't seem to like me much, or at the very least he only tolerates me for the sake of the others. Obviously breaking the lease early posses issues for my other roommates due to the nature of the apartment complex we live in , but I just don't really want to continue to stay somewhere that I am met with hostility for what I am thinking now was probably a misunderstanding. So I guess I just need advice and judgment of some sort, so WIBTAH and AITA.

Have you ever tried Monster? You’re gonna want them. (look at monster) This is one of them. This one is technically two servings, but it is really good. There are so many flavors, and they are all pretty good. They have caffeine in them, so it is a small boost in energy when you drink one. I personally enjoy the *Rehab* monsters, even though there are so few of them. The Rehab monsters are non-carbonated, so they are easier to drink. They also have some more normal flavors, like teas and lemonades.The *Ultra* monsters have “zero sugar” in them. My favorite flavor was an ultra flavor, it is discontinued now, but it was Monster Ultra Gold.  The Juice monsters, I don’t like, but they do have actual fruit juice in them. There’s also the Java monsters, but those are basically just coffee. Anyways, normally they have 101 calories, 7 mg of potassium, and vitamin b6. Also, according to [statisca.com](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1335489/monster-energy-drinks-brand-profile-in-the-united-states#:~:text=All%20in%20all%2C%2040%20percent,likely%20to%20use%20Monster%20again.), out of all energy drinkers, 40% drink monster. Also from the same website, 347 million monsters were sold in 2022. Monster also sponsors some sports like supercross(basically just motorcross) and Nascar. The monster brand also owns other energy drinks like NOS, Bang Energy, and Reign. Almost all of the people I know also drink monster and enjoy it. If you drink monster, you’ll feel better.

(Read for context),"So this is a long one so thank you in advance for anybody who decided to read and respond, and thank you for any candid advice or feedback you leave.

So here’s the situation, my 4 months pregnant wife(F36) and I (M28) live in our home, not far from my parents, with a one year old daughter. Due to unfortunate events my parents had to evacuate due to wildfires in the area and their home, my childhood home, burned down. I went the night of the evacuation to help them both. My mom has a lot of friends and she stayed with one of them in the area. My Dad doesn’t have as close a network and without question I invited him to stay at our place.

My Dad is 72, he dances a lot, loves to sing, very friendly and extremely intelligent and still have great cognitive and physical function. He has the spirit of a 25 year old. 

My wife is a neat freak, I’m not but I’ve always admired how she keeps things neat and tidy and cleans up after everything so things don’t pile up and become a mess later. A way of life I wasn’t used to until I met her but I try my best to emulate it as I enjoy it myself but nothing she holds against me and always gently reminds me to clean up after myself if I do leave a mess. She’s an amazing woman, patient, kind, understanding and we have a wonderful marriage.

My father on the other hand is pretty much the opposite, leaves things around the house whether it be a coffee mug or used plate, clothes that may be used later, etc. 

On the first day my wife finds he left 3 of his hemmoroid suppositories on the floor near my daughter’s toys and understandably she is annoyed as am I, and he didn’t even apologize, more of a defensive response of, “I wouldn’t have done that on purpose and they must have fallen” type response (just how he’s always been). 

He came home one night after smoking a cigar and I told him he had to change clothes because I didn’t want the smell to stick to our new couch. He did it, but first debated with me about him not smelling and I had to press him that he couldn’t smell it because he had just smoked.
  
Ok so some minor things and then one day he tells me he will be going to a dance that night. I had to ask otherwise he wouldn’t have told me, tuns out he wouldn’t be coming home till 1-2am, (side note but important: we were all using the side glass door which could only be locked from the inside because the front door was out of commission at the time). Then I ask him if he planned on taking a shower before going to sleep ( he gets really sweaty at these dances and I asked him because I was pretty sure if I don’t ask ahead, he won’t do it, which turns out to be the case) and he said no but he would have changed his clothes. Personally I think it’s a bit gross especially since it’s our living room couch, I don’t think it’s too much to ask for him to shower before bed. Thing is, it’s not just that, it’s that then I have to stay up for him to have the door unlocked for him and so I decided I wanted him to be home no later than 11:30 for all of the reasons— my daughter is asleep, if he takes a shower he might wake her up(he’s just generally noisy and doesn’t know how to be quiet or do things in a quiet manner), I don’t want to stay up for him. He decided to stay somewhere else that night but not without passive-aggressively guilt tripping me for it.

Then after all these things that are just general lack of courtesy and respect for our home and lifestyle, my wife finds a small piece of smeared shit on the floor of the bathroom that only he had been using. This was the last straw for me. His lack of self awareness is endangering the health of my baby daughter and I decided he needed to find somewhere else to stay. He didn’t even apologize. He acknowledged that it was “theoretically possible” but just seemed too embarrassed to really speak much about it. And then he went to “well when you get to be my age it gets harder” and “I’ve been bending over backwards to meet your guy’s standards” and “I was never going to be able to please your wife in the first place” as if it was her decision and I was just telling him. He’s not senile, and he had even mentioned not being senile, he’s just clumsy and very unaware of how he comes off and how he goes about things in general. He compared how my mom was staying in a bed and how he was uncomfortable on our couch, things like that, generally not appreciative except for one “thanks for everything”.

Another thing to note because I could see people saying you know like “he’s just lost everything” etc, he doesn’t even seem bothered much by the devastation, and he has insurance to cover all of his living expenses, not to mention tons of free resources at his disposal.

AITA?

For background, one of them is dating one of my colleagues in my masters and I do not get along well with him. Now that has led to a bit of a strain in our friendship, although we never discuss him as it is awkward. I thought that sort of neutrality was okay, and the program gets over in about a month now, but this thing has been grating me, I would like an opinion.

So basically, this friend (with the bf) and i used to share coffee, and the third one orders on her own.

But since last month, due to some heart issues, I stopped consuming coffee and informed her of the same. She said okay, and consumed the rest of the coffee on her own, which was fine. So at that time there were about 3 packs left (150gm of coffee). 

 Now she usually stays at her boyfriend’s place, so I ordered coffee as per her usual intake, that is, around 200 gm of coffee…..which I thought would last a month…..since she comes back in the morning and has been consuming it everyday. 

But she yelled at me and told me that she will not pay so much for coffee, and that I should have asked her as only 15-20 days are left till we leave the house. (We have a month’s notice, however). 

So I requested her to split the coffee with the other flatmate (who has around 9 cups coffee a day) if she doesn’t want so much coffee. 

But she refused outright and said she will not do that or pay at all.


Now I have been fuming for a while, and in the morning today I saw she had ordered her own coffee (albeit 50 gm)…..and it has just made me more mad.


She and I have been friends for 10 years now, and I fail to understand why she is reacting like this, especially when I normally order groceries for the house, including stuff for her as she normally isn’t present to order it. 

It wasn’t like I ordered too much, it was her usual amount, and she consumes it daily, including the day I ordered…..and even if she thought it was too much she could have at least paid for half? 

Am I overreacting by being angry about this? She didn’t care that I would have no use for this coffee and still made me lose money? And then ordered it herself? 

Ps: the brand of the coffee is the one she likes and consumes daily as well. ",1,1737002041.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.6,False

I want it to be browser based and majority of the game is played by clicking links to where you want to go (ie if your on earth you can go to earth store etc) I want the users to build a ship and when they are traveling the ship moves and such. I just dont know whats the best way to accomplish this. I cannot find a solid answer. When I look up website games, I get website and inserting games into it (like coolmath or whatever) My game will be a mix of a website and a actual game. Think Torn City but in space, Link based, but the user can see and do things in their ship while traveling and such. Idk if that explains it good so heres some pictures i drew up in photoshop to explain a bit better. (these images are not mine and I just quickly found them and inserted them)

The top Image Is what being on earth would look like. The left side is links to different pages where you can do different activities. 2nd image is the ""traveling"" image. This image is kinda what it would look like when you select where your going. 

The game is a crime game of sorts with some import export stuff to. It promotes bringing stuff to different areas in space to get higher rewards based off the economy (ie buy fuel at earth cheap, sell mars for profit) There will also be some territory wars and faction stuff aswell as crime businesses and companies you can run. Any ideas on how I can go about this?

I also have 1 day a week dedicated to cardio added on the 20 mins of cardio i do after every workout. I don’t drink alcohol or sugary drinks besides coffee.

Should I just wait for more results or is there anything I can do? I know i’ve only been going for a few months but feel like i should be noticing a difference around now. ",3,1737001939.0,loseit,9,1.0,False

1. **Productivity:** A distraction-free, well-designed space with fast Wi-Fi and great coffee keeps me focused.
2. **Community:** I’ve met amazing freelancers, creators, and entrepreneurs who inspire me every day.
3. **Balance:** Having a dedicated space helps me unplug after work hours.

It’s more than just a coworking space; it’s a vibrant community. From events that spark creativity to spaces that suit every kind of worker (**private desks, open seating, meeting rooms and conference rooms )**, it feels like a workplace designed for **YOU**.

They have a smartphone app to control/monitor the machine, which was built by another software company. So my only job in the beginning was to maintain it. By the end of this month, I will be the only software engineer left in the company because the only other embedded systems engineer is leaving. My Japanese level is at around N3/N4 which I wanted to improve a little bit before coming to Japan but the company said it was okay and wanted me here asap. However, I had shown a few interest in embedded systems development and electronics as well during the interview so they are expecting me to learn and maintain software that were previously outsourced. I have a senior who currently handles this but is leaving by the end of this month. I was okay with developing for embedded systems even if they use very basic tech (bare metal programming in C) but the documentation for electronics that I have to deal with are almost all in Japanese which adds a lot of complexities. Along with that, sometimes, I have to go out for durability testing, give a hand to fellow mechanical and electrical engineers when needed and wear office dress everyday like a factory worker even if I was hired for software.

Work pressure is not much at all because my responsibilities are all about maintaining the software. Also, I rarely do overtime and the office environment doesn't seem toxic. Altogether it's not a bad job but I usually feel disconnected because most of the work I do are either out of my specialty or of very little interest to me. It was fun in the beginning to try things completely out of my domain but now I miss working like crazy on softwares fueled by coffee and music in the background.
