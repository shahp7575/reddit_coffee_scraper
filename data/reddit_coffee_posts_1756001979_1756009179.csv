1mym1ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mym1ld/know_thyself/,Know thyself,"Since many posts can be addressed with the same concept, I wanted to delve a bit deeper into it. Many forces draw our attention outwards, including relatively recent notions of romantic love (that some claim has replaced religion as a central tenet of meaning in our lives, which leads to disastrous consequences).

One problem with constant distraction is that our authentic voice is subtle. It needs silence to express itself. That loud voice in your head, the intense one telling you to get up and grind, is an expression of narcissistic tendencies. It is the side that feels the need to perform to receive validation.

Narcissism is a natural phase of human development and a helpful adaptation when it remains subclinical, but it is no path to a meaningful life. It is the exact opposite, in fact. But again, there are many cultural incentives to adopt a narcissistic personality, even if you are not pathological.

You need to enforce ""quiet"" in your lives. Even (especially) if you are in a relationship or a close living situation. When you do that and spend time in solitude (solitude is a choice - loneliness feels imposed), you will get to know yourself.

Allow that self-knowledge to inform a mission. Something you could imagine dying for.

On a lower level, find a purpose in life. Something that you enjoy doing so that you spend the time needed to gain mastery. Prioritize in-person relationships - while it's nice to share things online, it can't replace the intimacy of in-person connections.

A one-minute conversation with the person who serves you coffee has more emotional value than spending hours online. Doing absolutely nothing, for that matter, has more positive emotional value than getting Insta/fb/Twitter/Reddit, etc.

So do a lot of nothing at first, it is ok. If you don't know where you are going, you're essentially lost at a rapid pace.

It's a long road, but ultimately worth it. Money, relationships, status, novelty, and agency are consequences of self-knowledge, and they are far from the most valuable ones.

By the way, I am not suggesting that we live in some sort of meritocracy - being born rich is the best way to become rich, but the rest of us need to fight, tooth and claw - really just to get by, let alone thrive.

Best of luck - I'm here if you ever want to talk.",1,1756009073.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1mylxw4,https://i.redd.it/585y8sci7wkf1.jpeg,Anyone know this novel?,"""Do you love her?That girl you go to see everyday. "" She said and I held back a gasp.
She knows.....but she doesn't know who it is.
""I h-have been seeing Nia for three months now. Since the Reunion night."" 
""I didn't know it was going to turn out like this Bells, I thought we were just becoming friends again but one night we ended up pecking,"" I said and she chuckled bitterly.
""And then I just couldn't stay without her, I started seeing her everyday. Yes, I used work as excuse but that was because I didn't want to hurt you,"" I said.
""I feel like we've fallen apart Bella. I don't feel the love between us anymore, its g-gone for me"" I said and her lips parted, not to speak anything but to take in a shaky breath.

-3 months before-
Third person's POV
""Wow I can't believe how far we've all come"" Justin said while his arm was wrapped securely around his beautiful wife, Bella as they stood with Justin's school friends at the reunion party.
""I know, but you are the winner here"" Ryan said to Justin.
""Oh come on, we're all successful, it doesn't matter bro"" Justin said to him.
""I'm talking about your bombshell wife dude, not your money"" Ryan said making everyone laugh.
""Well, yeah, in that case, I'm the luckiest of all"" Justin said and placed a soft peck on Bella's cheek.
He still wasn't over how gorgeous she was looking in her black dress and her wavy brunette hair left untied.
""Guys, there's a change in plan, we're leaving this boring party"" Chaz announced and everyone looked at him with confusion.
""We're gonna go party old school way just the way we used to. And just the gang, you'll are gonna have to ditch your boyfriends, girlfriends and wife tonight"" He said.
""I'm in!"" Ryan said.
""Uh...not today man, maybe someday later?"" Justin said, he really wanted to go home and spend time with his wife.
""Why not? Go, have fun"" Bella said to him.
""Exactly, come on dude, it been years since we've all been together!"" Chaz said.
""Oh and just to inform you, Nia has been invited too, if you're uncomfortable, we can totally un-invite her"" Chaz added and Justin looked at Bella nervously.
""Why are you looking at me like that? I'm not gonna say no! And plus its been years since that whole thing and I don't mind until you come home safe and not too wasted, we have work tomorrow"" Bella said to him.
Maybe its not that bad of an idea.
""If the boss approves, then okay"" Justin said and shrugged.
""Yes! and don't worry Bella, if he gets wasted, I'll bring him home safely and then maybe we can talk about your divorce with him and plan our wedding quick?"" Ryan said and everyone laughed again.
""Okay, now you need to back off before I break your jaw"" Justin said and Ryan put his hands up.
""Go have fun"" Bella said to him and fixed his collar before pecking him quickly.
""I'll be home as soon as possible"" He said and she nodded in response.
After that, they all said goodbye to Bella and Justin went off with the guys while the driver drove Bella home.
She changed into one of Justin's comfortable t shirts and started watching a movie to kill time till Justin gets home.
Justin on the other hand got rid of all his nervousness when they arrived at the club. In the car, he couldn't help but notice how Nia still looked the way she used to, it was almost like nothing had changed about her.
She was still the same, sweet and kind.
Nia Gomez, Justin Bieber's first serious girl since high school. It was the very first time he got into a serious relationship, she's his very first love.
He had an amazing relationship with her for four years but then things got bad. They fought all the time, went months without speaking or seeing each other, blamed each other for everything, and the relationship got so poisoned that it died in a bitter and toxic way.
and just a year after that, Justin found Bella and she turned out to be everything he asked for and he's been the happiest with her for five years now.
The music was loud and most of them started drinking and dancing already. Justin noticed Selena take a seat at the bar, so he gathered up some courage and decided to go say Hi to her.
He walked to her and sat down in the bar stool beside her.
""Hey"" He said to her with a nervous smile.
""Hi"" She smiled back at him.
""Y-You look great"" He said.
""Thank you Justin, you too"" She said to him.
""So, how you've been?"" He asked her, still feeling nervous.
""I'm...fine, how about you? Considering you married a girl like Bella, you have to be happy"" She said and he smiled widely.
""Yeah, I'm more than happy with her, she's amazing"" He said quickly and then noticed her smile drop a little as she nodded.
He realized that Bella's topic isn't the best thing to talk with your ex so he decided to lighten the situation.
""But what about you though?"" He asked and she chuckled.
""Me? You mean any man in my life?"" She said and he nodded.
""No...not since you"" She said after shaking her head and Justin lost his smile too.
That revelation suddenly made him feel bad for her.
Whatever happened, did leave both of them extremely broken but now learning that he had moved and gotten married but she hadn't even gotten with any man after him made him feel guilty for some reason.
""Well, you don't need one"" He said and they shared a laugh over it.
""This party is too crowded and loud for me, I think I'll just go have a coffee and go home"" She said.
""Coffee? now?"" Justin said and she nodded.
""I really want one right now"" She said and got off the stool.
""If you aren't interested here either, would you like to join?"" She asked him and Justin looked around.
Yes the party was too loud and not a good decision for a work night. He thought coffee would be better than getting wasted.
""Sure"" He said which made her smile at him.
-----
It was 2 am, Justin still wasn't home, nor was he picking his phone up or replying to Bella's texts. She was freaking out and worried out of her wits.
She decided to call Ryan who didn't pick his phone either so she dialed up Chaz who thankfully did pick up.
""Chaz, hey, is Justin with you?"" She asked, by the loud music in the background, she realized that he's still at the party.
""WHAT? I can't hear you!"" Chaz shouted.
""Is Justin with you!"" Bella asked loudly.
""Uhhh no, I haven't seen him for a while now"" He said making Bella's heartbeat quicken with fear.
""What?!"" She said.
""Hey, don't worry, Ryan went home since he got too drunk too soon, I think Justin took him home, he'll probably stay there and be back in the morning or something"" He said.
""Oh, okay"" She said and hung up.
She still wasn't convinced with what Chaz said.
If he was at Ryan's why wouldn't he pick his phone up? And Justin's the kind of person who always informs Bella if he's going somewhere else or its going to be late until he gets home.
Bella got no sleep that night since Justin never came home until ten in the morning.
He came home, not looking wasted or even a bit drunk at all and when she asked him where he was, all he said was 'at a friend's house'.
He kept dodging all her questions the whole day, barely talked and spent most of his time on the phone even in the office.
That day, she knew something had changed.
But she had no idea that this change will be worse than what she thinks. She wasn't aware of anything that was about to come her way.
 
Bella's Pov
""Are you coming home with me today?"" I asked Justin once I went into his cabin. He looked away from his laptop to look at me.
""Babe, you know I'd love to but I have so much work"" He said and I sighed.
""You can do it from home"" I said and he stood up and walked to me and wrapped his arms around me.
I let myself enjoy the feeling since his holding me like this has gotten really rare lately.
""I could, but I have a beautiful wife at home who will definitely distract me unintentionally. Its me who won't be able to work at all then"" He said and I faked a smile.
I didn't say anything more, because I know, no matter how much I convince him, he won't come home.
""Fine"" I said.
""Oh, and don't cook dinner for me, I'll probably just eat something now since I'm hungry"" He said and I licked my lips and nodded.
""See you later baby"" He said and pecked my cheek before I left.
I drove myself home as soon as I could.
I'm getting so tired of this.
Since a couple of months, he's been so distant. And now, since a while, he's been leaving for work too early and coming home after midnight.
I'm his assistant, I'm the one who frames his schedule and I always make sure that nothing stresses him too much and when the work load is too much, I do some things but he just finds something to keep him in the office longer than me.
I only see him in the office, its like we're only an assistant and a boss and not husband and wife anymore.
I felt a little more lonelier at home today than I usually do, I should probably just call Hailey.
I dialed her up and she picked up two rings later.
""Hey boo, sup?"" She said.
""Hey, I wanted ask if you can come over, I'm bored"" I said.
""Got the house to yourself again?"" She said and I huffed.
""Yes"" I mumbled.
""Be there in ten"" She said and I smiled a small smile.
""Thank you"" I said and hung up.
Thankfully, Hailey bought a take away dinner with her from our favorite Chinese restaurant.
""Thank God, you got this, I really didn't wanna cook today, anyways even Justin isn't having dinner at home today either"" I said as we plopped down on the couch.
""Yeah, I met him"" She said and I looked at her.
""Met him? You went to the office?"" I asked.
""No Bella, why would I go to the office when I know you're home, I met him at the restaurant"" She said and I fiddled with hem of my t-shirt.
""W-What was he doing there?"" I asked and she shrugged.
""I don't know, he was arriving when I was leaving the place, he almost looked as if he was gonna poop in his pants when he saw me. I said hi to him but he seemed to be in a hurry so I ended the conversation quickly and left"" She said.
""Oh"" I said and nodded.
Why would he go to the restaurant alone? and why was he in a hurry at all?
""He didn't tell you about it again right?"" Hailey snapped me out and I bit my lower lip nervously and nodded.
""When I left work, he said he told me not to cook dinner for him since he was hungry and wanted to eat something right away. And there wasn't even a scheduled dinner with any partners or something today"" I said.
""Bells, how long are you gonna keep trying to figure out stuff like this, I'm telling you, the stuff he's been doing is absolutely weird and you need to confront him about it"" She said and I nodded.
""Maybe its not something bad but he needs to tell you whatever that is going on cos its been a while since he's acting like weirdo"" She said.
""Yeah, I guess I'll talk to him tonight"" I said.
""Okay, forget that now, lets eat, I'm so hungry!"" She said.
Before starting to have the dinner, I left Justin a text:
'Please come home early today, there's something important we need to talk about'
He kept asking me what is that about but I told him, I can only talk face to face.
-------------
It was 10 pm when I finally heard the door unlock and Justin came in. His jacket was draped over his arm and I stood up and walked to him and took the jacket and keys from him.
""Hey, what did you want to talk about?"" He asked immediately.
""You just got here Justin, aren't we supposed to peck and ask each other how was the day even when we work together, just like we used to a while before?"" I said.
""Hey, of course, I just asked because you said its important and didn't even give me a clue, I got a bit tensed"" He said and grabbed my arms and pulled me closer.
""Why? What do you think I wanna talk about?"" I said and he looked confused and tensed as he tried to search for a clue on my face.
""Bell, what's the matter?"" He said.
""There is no matter, I just wanna talk, you are the one who's unnecessarily tensed"" I said.
He exhaled deeply and shook his head before cupping my cheek.
""You know what, we can talk about that later"" He said and started leaning in to peck me but I placed my hand against his chest and stopped him.
""Where were you?"" I asked and he chuckled.
""Seriously? You just asked me to peck you and now you stopped me and asked me that, of course I was at work Bella"" He said.
""I called Hailey over, she got us dinner from the Chinese restaurant she said she met you there and you seemed to be in a hurry"" I said and he face dropped.
""Well y-yeah, I got myself some noodles from there"" He said.
""You told me you were going to eat right away and if you weren't, you could've just told me to cook, you know I would've"" I said.
He smiled again and tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear.
""Babe, you looked quiet tired too, I didn't wanna bother you and also you-
""Justin are you hiding something from me?"" I cut him off and got to the main question straight and he didn't speak for a couple seconds.
""Hiding?"" He said and I nodded.
""Yes, anything, if you are, you know you can tell me"" I said.
""No Bella, I'm not hiding anything from you why'd you think that?"" He said, pulling away a little.
""You tell me why. Its been so weird between us lately, and now its really starting to bother me!"" I said, feeling the tears prick the back of my eyes.
""Weird?! What is weird here Bella? That I went to a restaurant without telling you? Is that too weird?"" He said, pulling his arms off me.
""Yes, also you leaving so early in the morning and coming home so late, I set your schedule Justin, and I know there isn't as much work as you make it seem to be. Tell me the last time we sat peacefully and just talked? Forget pecking or anything else! We haven't had a conversation other than work or 'Justin when are you coming home?' and 'Will you be having dinner at home today?'"" I said, the tears now threatening to fall.
""So you think I'm lying when I say I have work?"" He said.
""That's what I'm asking you, tell me what's going on?"" I said and grabbed his hand but he flicked me away.
""Nothing is going on Bella! its pathetic that you even think that and once the work load reduces, I'll give you all the time you want!"" He said, his voice raising
""When!? when will this be over?! Its been three months now, how long do I have to wait till I can spend the normal amount of time with you like we used to?"" I said.
""Bella look, I'm too tired, I don't think I can argue about this right now. Just let's go sleep"" He said and started to walk away.
By the time I wiped all my tears away and stopped crying and went to our bedroom, he had already gotten in the bed.
Without saying anything else, I did the same and slept facing away from him.
I waited for a long time. For a long time, hoping that he'd wrap his arms around me any moment and say sorry but he didn't.
It feels like its been forever since I've felt his touch, or just his mere presence around me either. He's might be there with me physically but mentally, he always seems lost somewhere else.
How am I not supposed to think that something is wrong when he reminds me of it every second.
I really tried to convince myself that its nothing for so long but I just can't take this distance anymore.
It's like we're miles apart even when we're next to each other. And I've almost forgotten the warm feeling of his love.
And there's one huge question that I even deny the possibility of but its always floating around me, sending chills down my spine.
And as much as I want to ask him that, I'm afraid the answer won't be what I expect it to be.
But I don't know how long I can keep swallowing those words...
""Are you cheating on me?"" My shaky voice whispered and got no response. I managed to fall asleep to the sound of his steady breathing.",1,1756008729.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1mylvnk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mylvnk,Claude Finally Got Image and Video Powers! The Canva integration that gives Claude users visual superpowers (Complete guide with 50+ prompts you can use),"  
**TL;DR:** Claude couldn't generate images like ChatGPT or Gemini - until now. The new Canva integration gives Claude the ability to create, edit, and manage professional designs through conversation. I've been testing this for weeks and it works great - better than ChatGPT and Gemini Images. 

# The Superpower Claude Users Have Been Waiting For

Let's be honest - we've all been jealous watching ChatGPT and Gemini users generate images while Claude just... couldn't. Sure, Claude's writing is unmatched, but when you needed visuals? You were stuck.

**That just changed completely.**

Three weeks ago, Anthropic quietly gave Claude something even better than basic image generation: the ability to control Canva directly. This isn't just ""make me a picture of a cat"" - this is **""create my entire marketing campaign, with my brand colors, export it in 5 formats, and organize it in folders.""**

After testing this obsessively, I can confidently say: Claude users now have the most powerful visual creation tool of any AI assistant. Period.

I was reading that the team at Anthropic uses Canva extensively and so they made this integration work really well.

# Why This Is Actually Better Than Native Image Generation

**Claude's Disadvantage Became Its Advantage:**

    Feature ChatGPT/Gemini Image Gen         Claude + Canva Professional 
    Templates ❌ Start from scratch           ✅ Access to millions of pro templates Brand Consistency ❌ Recreate brand each time   ✅ Save & reuse brand kits 
    Multiple Versions ❌ One at a time        ✅ Generates 3-5 options automatically Editable Files ❌ Static images only      ✅ Full Canva projects you can edit Team Collaboration ❌ Just an image file       ✅ Share editable Canva links 
    Export Control ❌ PNG/JPG only            ✅ PDF, PNG, GIF, MP4, PPTX

# The Real Cost (And How to Test for Free)

**Full Setup:**

* Claude Pro: $20/month (required)
* Canva Pro: $15/month
* **Total: $35/month**

**Pro Tip:** Canva offers a **30-day free trial** of their Pro plan. Test the full workflow for a month before committing. I made back the subscription cost in my first week just from time saved.

**Setup Process (Literally 5 Minutes):**

1. Sign up for Claude Pro
2. Start Canva Pro free trial (or use existing account)
3. Go to Claude settings → Integrations → Connect Canva
4. Authenticate
5. Start designing

# The Hidden Powers: Multiple Versions & Smart Organization

Here's what blew my mind - **Claude doesn't just create one design, it generates 12 multiple versions and lets you choose**.  Then you can pick the winner, make any final edits easily n Canva.  Unlike ChatGPT and Gemni images its easy to correct text and remove anything odd from the visuals.

More importantly, in creating assets Canva can actually create the right size of images!   Gemini and ChatGPT just struggle with this a lot.  

Example conversation:

    You: ""Create an Instagram post for our coffee shop's morning special""
    Claude: ""I've created 3 versions for you:
    - Version 1: Minimalist with coffee bean pattern
    - Version 2: Cozy café photo background
    - Version 3: Bold typography focus
    Which style do you prefer?""

**Even better:** Claude can organize everything for you:

    ""Set up my Canva workspace for Q1 marketing:
    - Create folders: Social Media, Email Headers, Print Materials
    - Upload my logo and brand colors
    - Create templates for each content type
    - Name everything with consistent conventions""

# Two Approaches to Brand Setup (Choose Your Fighter)

**Option 1: Let Claude Do Everything**

    ""Here's my brand guide: [paste info]. Set up my Canva workspace:
    - Create brand kit with colors #2D5016 and #FFF8DC
    - Set Montserrat as primary font
    - Upload these assets: [attach files]
    - Create master templates for social, email, and presentations""

**Option 2: Manual Setup + Claude Reference** (Often more reliable)

1. Upload brand assets directly in Canva
2. Create your brand kit in Canva's Brand Kit section
3. Tell Claude: `""Use my 'Tech Startup 2025' brand kit for all designs""`
4. Claude will automatically pull your colors, fonts, and logos

I've found Option 2 works better for complex brand guidelines, while Option 1 is perfect for quick projects.

# Your Complete Workflow (From Zero to Campaign)

**Step 1: Initial Brand Setup**

    ""Check my Canva workspace. Create a new project folder called 'Product Launch Q1'.
    Set up subfolders for Instagram, LinkedIn, Email, and Print.""

**Step 2: Claude Creates Multiple Options**

    ""Create 3 different Instagram post designs announcing our new eco-friendly packaging.
    Use different approaches - one minimal, one with product photo, one typography-focused.""

**Step 3: Choose and Refine**

    ""I like version 2. Now create matching designs for:
    - Instagram Story (add 'Swipe Up' area)
    - LinkedIn post (more professional tone)
    - Email header (include CTA button space)""

**Step 4: Export and Organize**

    ""Export all designs as PNG for digital and PDF for print.
    Save to the appropriate folders in our Product Launch project.""

Trying to break into being a legal secretary or even just a legal administrator role, but have 0 legal experience. How would you react if someone reached out to you about volunteering at your firm to get any exposure?","Hello,

Im a 48 F who most recently has been in restaurant management. I was in software and in my life, and  also did all kinds of administrative tasks. 

I received my degree in English Literature, but when I graduated in 2008- the economy in San Diego was terrible and the school districts were pink slipping all teachers who had less than five years. I didn't want to spend more money on a credential program at that time, and ended up in software somehow.

Let me get to the point. I am thinking about working in law as a legal secretary and get my certification. I have lots of time at the moment. I was thinking of contacting law firms and essentially asking if they would allow me to volunteer at their firm in any capacity to receive exposure and gain experience. 

Maybe I start off just making coffee and running to office depot. But then maybe one day someone asks me to file something. The requests build over time and with hope they find me sharp, dependable and helpful. 

Restaurant management gave me amazing skills of working under immense pressure well. Dealing with HR issues and the need for privacy. Dealing with highly escalated situations and having to calm them down; escalation management. Empathy and patience. Definitely being able to multitask. Also, the ability to give great customer service,.

Any advice any lawyers could give? Would you be open to letting someone volunteer? Is this even feasible in that industry?

I could volunteer 5 days a week for a few months and then if I have to go back to restaurant management, I could guarantee a minimum of two days per week.

Again, any advice? Thoughts? Why it would work for your firm? Why you don't think it would work?

Thank you!

Edit: My main reason in getting out of hospitality is simply the physical aspect as I get older. I am in great shape from this career- except now my feet and back have arthritis.

1myluyy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myluyy,Bik coffee review,"Another cheap coffee I tried. The website didn't mention that this was ground coffee not beans but then they also didn't have options to choose grind size. The grind looks like made for filter coffee. I tried making espresso using Kompresso and it came out ok but with fine particles which is expected for the grind size. Secondly, they ship via indiapost which they hadn't mention on the site. For me they mailed the coffee via professional courier which took 14 days to deliver. Roast date mentioned was 1st Aug. Having said that finally I got to taste the coffee but couldn't dial in properly because of grind size and ratios. It tastes nutty and strong. Good for the price. I would like if they offer beans but they aren't very responsive on customer care either. 250+50shipping I paid is totally worth it for 250gms. If we press them for offering whole beans collectively, maybe it will work.

1mylrrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mylrrp/my_husband_36m_doesnt_address_issues_with_me30f/,"My husband (36M) doesn't address issues with me(30F), until and unless I address issues with him","We've been together eight years, married for seven. Today I told my husband that I wanted something to be done differently. It had to do with the way that we parent. It was regarding something occuring in the moment. He blew up and yelled, saying that I should shut up and listed reasons why. The reasons, for one thing, had nothing to do with the conversation that I was trying to have, and secondly, were things that had gone on for some time, some for days and some for months, that I recall him not reacting to and us having a good day despite these apparent transgressions.

This happens often. Always, actually. I'll bring up something that I need, be it regarding the kids, the house, something else - something that it seems perhaps he should be doing and isn't already - he feels attacked, thinks I'm trying to hurt me (I'm trying to help us) and uses things that I've done that he's previously reacted neutrally to, against me.

I tell him over and over again that it feels like the rug is being pulled out from under me, like I'm breaking a code that I didn't get the memo for, like he's a cop letting me know that I've been running red lights over the past five weeks but the truth is the lights had stayed blatantly green.

I ask him to put the fires out when they start, to warn me about them and give me a chance to act accordingly instead of letting them sneak up on me so that I get burned. By fires I mean resentments - I speak in analogies because I don't think the plain descriptions are valid enough.

When he does this it triggers my nervous system. I shake, I cry, I don't know what to do. I spiral. I self destruct. I overreact.

There is a difference between criticising to hurt and criticizing to help. I am trying to help, though he may be hurt by it. He is trying to hurt, and succeeding, and then he carries on with his day because it's off his chest and I want to off myself.

Everyone has things in their relationship that are not working for them. I thought that the point was to share these and work together and that that was what build a strong foundation for a relationship.

I wanted to leave this relationship a long time ago, when we first got married. He told me that I would be taking a step backward in life, that I would not be better off without him, that we should give it time and revisit and see if he wanted to end it. He convinced me that we should have this life together and it would be worth it. And I betrayed myself when I decided to stay. I knew I was settling, he knew I was settling, he told me that it was better than being alone and I believed him. He was the first relationship I'd ever had and it had taken me long enough to find someone who wanted one. This back and forth about leaving happened about four times, and then we got pregnant and never talked about it again.

Now the earnestness he showed about wanting the relationship to work has vanished. I guess we both realized that we had invested in an idea.

I tell him this. I tell him that he fought tooth and nail for this relationship, and ask why he doesn't want to help me build it. At least help make it worthwhile for both of us.

He says that that's the past, it's irrelevant. I should leave if I want. He knows I can't yet afford to, especially with kids (even if he helps me financially, I don't want their mom to live in a bad neighborhood or in a dodgy apartment). I didn't want to be a single mom, he promised to take care of me and be the love of my life. Now it seems not only that he doesn't care if he hurts me, but that it's intentional.

He'll bring up my emotionally abusive parents, say that I'm critical because of them. I can't trust him anymore. We could have the best day and the deepest conversations (these days happen when I contort myself into a small and acceptable box that can balance on years worth of eggshells, all while wearing tight and revealing clothes and being super easygoing), and everything that was said and done that day will get thrown in my face a month later when I tell him that I don't like that I have to wipe his crumbs off the table before I sit down to have my morning coffee.

I know I'm far from perfect. It's clear that I trigger him. I am emotionally dysregulated myself. I am not saying that I don't deserve this.

But it's killing me.

I'm devastated that we see it so differently.

Each time I call him out, I am trying to address and adjust. I want him to know that something isn't working for me, in hopes of resolution but if not, at the very least for transparency.

He thinks it's appalling that I would dare say anything and says that I'm throwing stones.

I'm not saying I don't have flaws, we all do. I just thought that a partner was supposed to be your mirror, not your ""yes"" person.

I think it's a shame that he saves his observations of me to use as ammo instead of offering them to me from a place of love. I would gladly take them, good, bad and ugly. If only. If only they were for and not against me.

I don't know what to do. I tell him what I need and he won't/can't give it to me. I think it's small. For him, it seems a big ask. Where is the line between controlling him vs. confiding in him?

TL;DR: I address issues with the intention of resolving them. He thinks I do it to criticize him. In defense, he'll call me a hypocrite and list things I've been doing. I will feel stupid because he acted like said things were fine at the time. I ask him not to do blindside me like that, give me warning first. He just can't. He won't.

Our friendship had only been rocky once we both graduated high school I left to another city for college and she went to a local college. Everything was okay until she would complain that I wouldn’t facetime as often and ofc I would apologize but also explained that I was in another city where my attention is consistently occupied. Which she somewhat understood but was still upset and said I needed to still make time for her.

Throughout college this seemed like a reoccurring problem of me not having the time to spend with her and her taking the minimum that I can only give.

End of senior year she proceeds to invite me to her grad party and her birthday party to which i said no to the grad party bc it was the WEEKEND OF FINALS (over text she said that she understood) and for her birthday party I didn’t want to go because there were wayy too many mixed signals which I thought needed to be addressed. Why am I going to a party where I have to act like everything is ok? Also this was shitty of me but when we met for coffee (I’ll mention the coffee chat again)… I did RSVP to another party bc I completely forgot that that day was her birthday. I did apologize though. Anyways I still wouldn’t have gone. I felt bad but I didn’t feel comfortable to go. Our friendship isn’t the same as it once was, she’s gotten more sensitive and I’ve become more bold, straightforward, and witty/cheeky. But she sees it as more intense and too blunt?

We later met up for coffee and talked about expectations of me which I told her that I can’t give so much of my time since I’m busy with work (i’m still in a diff city) she said that she isn’t happy with that but since that’s all i can give she’ll take it. Also she brought up how she was still upset that I didn’t go to her grad party and I simply told her there was no way I could’ve gone she still persisted to say that I should’ve at least stayed for a bit and then drove back to then study afterwards. LET ME REMIND YOU THIS WAS THE WEEKEND BEFORE FINALS there was no way in hell I was going to do a 2 hour drive there and back to then go home and then study for finals. She said that she understood? So at the end of it we talked it out and she started to tear up saying that I thought we wouldn’t be friends anymore, etc which I too felt emotional considering it’s a long friendship that we had.

But afterwards I had a moment to reflect and I honestly don’t want to be friends with her anymore AND she did t something petty two weeks later 🙄. Rn she’s on vacation and i go to grad school in the fall so before i go i plan on sending her a small message of how i think we aren’t compatible anymore and to not contact me.

Ever dreamed of being a wizard? Not the kind with a pointy hat and a long staff—though that’s pretty cool too—but a coding wizard. You know, the type who conjures up apps, scripts, and digital wonders with just a flick of the keyboard. If you’ve ever written a line of code and felt like you were casting a spell, then welcome to the wizarding world of programming.

Coding isn’t just logic—it’s modern sorcery. With the right incantations (or functions), you can make websites appear, automate tasks, and even bring cryptocurrencies to life in creative ways. And speaking of crypto magic, let’s talk about one spell every Bitcoin enthusiast should have in their grimoire: **QR codes**.

Yes, those little black-and-white squares that look like pixel art from an ancient scroll are actually gateways to seamless Bitcoin transactions. But how do you, oh mighty coding wizard, create them? Do you need to hand-craft them in a dark basement under a full moon? Nope! All you need is your browser and the ultimate tool: [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

With this tool, you can generate QR codes faster than you can say *“Satoshi!”* Whether you’re sending Bitcoin to a friend, adding a donation button to your website, or building an entire e-commerce empire, a QR code simplifies the process. No more copying and pasting long, awkward Bitcoin addresses that look like they were forged in Mordor. Just scan and pay—it’s that easy.

Think about it: QR codes are like magical portals. Someone points their phone at your code, and—poof!—a Bitcoin address is loaded, ready for action. That’s the beauty of combining coding wizardry with crypto magic. You’re not just writing functions; you’re shaping the future of money.

And here’s where the fun begins. As a coding wizard, you can integrate these QR codes into your own projects. Building a blog? Drop a donation QR code at the bottom. Running an online shop? Add a Bitcoin payment option with a scannable code. Hosting a live stream? Display your QR code on-screen and watch the tips roll in faster than a Quidditch match.

The best part? You don’t need to burn hours writing complex scripts to generate these codes from scratch. **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** does the heavy lifting, so you can focus on the fun stuff—like enchanting your UI, optimizing your spells (ahem, code), and sipping coffee like the tech sorcerer you are.

So grab your digital wand (aka keyboard) and start crafting some Bitcoin magic today.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Finding a real connection these days feels almost impossible. Everyone is busy curating perfection filters, highlights, and captions that sound like poetry but mean nothing. We talk, we text, we exchange “wyd” and “lol,” and then… silence. Another conversation lost in the black hole of ghosting.

And I’m tired of that.

I’m not looking for something temporary or shallow. I’m not here for attention, validation, or a casual chat that disappears like a Snapchat story. I want something real. Something that makes me pause in the middle of the chaos and think, “Oh, this is what I’ve been missing.”

I want that feeling of peace when silence doesn’t feel awkward it feels safe. That warmth of knowing someone has your back even when words fail. That spark when a conversation isn’t about impressing each other but about peeling back layers and saying, “This is me. Who are you?”

Who I Am (The Short Version That’s Actually Long)

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. That means I’ve seen life at its most fragile and beautiful, and it’s taught me one thing: time is too precious for fake connections.

But let me be clear I’m not just a white coat with a stethoscope. I’m a certified nerd, and I mean that in the best way.

Here’s what that looks like:

I quote Marvel lines mid-conversation and expect you to get them (bonus points if you do).

I still overthink the ending of Interstellar and wonder how time feels on Miller’s planet.

I’ve cried over fictional characters like they were real people and honestly, no regrets.

I read about things I don’t need to know, like black holes, multiverses, quantum mechanics, and whether AI will ever develop emotions.

I drink chai like it’s my religion and believe memes are a love language.


Basically, my mind is a constant mix of medicine, science, stories, and weird what-ifs. One second I’m wondering why trauma stays in our bones, and the next I’m thinking about which villain actually had a point.

I’m also learning Klingon. Because… why not? Curiosity is my curse and my blessing.

If I’m not working, you’ll probably find me doing one of these:

Binge-watching something I’ll later overanalyze

Falling down a rabbit hole about space or psychology

Writing random thoughts that feel too heavy for small talk

Laughing at the dumbest memes until my stomach hurts


So yeah, I’m equal parts deep and ridiculous. And I like it that way.


---

Why I’m Here (And Why This Feels Scary)

This is my first time writing something like this. So yeah, it feels like I’m walking into a room full of strangers and saying, “Hey, this is me. No masks, no filters. Just me.”

I could have played it safe dropped a generic “looking for good vibes” post like everyone else. But that’s not me. If I’m putting myself out here, it has to be honest.

So here’s the truth: I want a real connection that could turn into something meaningful. Not a fling. Not a situationship. Not something that fades the moment life gets busy.

I want someone who makes me feel understood without trying too hard. Someone who gets why I pause mid-movie to talk about existential questions. Someone who sends me a random song at midnight because it reminded them of me. Someone who believes that love isn’t just grand gestures it’s the little things, every single day.


---

What I’m Looking For (And What I’m Not)

I’m looking for someone real. Someone kind. Someone who isn’t scared of feelings. Someone who knows that vulnerability isn’t weakness it’s courage.

Not perfect. Just present.
Someone who:

Laughs like an idiot over silly jokes

Can talk about dreams, fears, childhood, and why love feels like both a war and a poem

Loves deep conversations but also dumb memes

Can say, “I’m not okay, can we just exist together?” without shame

Feels music in their bones

Wants a connection that feels like home, not a temporary distraction


What I’m NOT looking for:

Ghosters (seriously, no disappearing acts)

People scared of depth (it’s not lava, I promise)

Someone who thinks relationships are just Instagram stories and matching outfits

Anyone allergic to memes (instant deal-breaker)



---

What Love Means to Me (Spoiler: It’s Not a Movie Scene)

Love, for me, isn’t fireworks every day. It’s not about big speeches or cinematic kisses in the rain (though hey, I wouldn’t complain).

It’s about…

Sending each other memes that make us laugh in public like idiots

Watching a movie together and pausing every five minutes to discuss character arcs

Sitting in silence and still feeling connected

Remembering the small details the song you like, the tea you prefer, the thing that makes your eyes light up

Being each other’s safe place on the worst days

Choosing each other again and again even when life gets hard


Love is both ordinary and extraordinary. It’s in the little things, the daily things. And I want that.


---

What I Bring to the Table

Presence – If I care, I show up. No excuses.

Honesty – No games. No fake highlights. Just real.

Loyalty – If you’re mine, you’re my priority.

Humor – From sarcastic comments to the dumbest puns.

Empathy – Because life is hard and everyone deserves a soft place to land.

Nerd Energy – Random science facts, existential questions, and maybe even learning your favorite language to flirt badly in it.

What Being With Me Might Feel Like

Picture this:

We’re on a late-night call. You’re working, I’m studying. Lo-fi beats in the background. Every now and then, I look up and say something like, “You know, statistically, people this cute should be illegal. It’s messing with universal balance.”

We binge-watch a sci-fi series and end up pausing every 10 minutes because one of us says, “Okay, but if time travel existed, would you go back to meet me sooner?”

We’re making a playlist together. You sneak in a love song. I ask why. You smirk. My brain crashes.

We argue about which superhero is the best and end up mock role-playing as them at 2 a.m. (I call dibs on Iron Man.)



---

If We End Up Together Someday (Just Saying)

Matching mugs for chai and coffee because aesthetic matters

Random bookstore dates where I pretend I know more than you (I don’t)

Laughing so hard at a meme that we spill tea and still can’t stop laughing

Building a Lego Death Star at 3 a.m. because why not?

Me learning your favorite language just to say something romantic in the worst accent ever

Movie marathons where we rate villains on a scale from “evil” to “misunderstood genius”

The Honest Truth About Me

I’ve been broken before. Really broken.
But I never stopped hoping. Never stopped showing up.

I don’t want perfect. I want real.
Someone who understands that love isn’t easy but still chooses it.

I want someone who sees all my chaos and stays. Someone who gets that I’m not flawless, but I’m trying. Someone who knows that love is work, but beautiful work.

I want someone who sees all my chaos and stays. Someone who gets that I’m not flawless, but I’m trying. Someone who knows that love is work, but beautiful work.

The Invitation (A Little Leap of Faith)

So if you’ve read this far and felt something anything send me a message.
Send me a meme. A lyric. A random thought. A “hi.”

Because maybe this isn’t just another post.
Maybe this is our sign.
Our little crack in the chaos.
Our first step toward something rare.

Two people. Two screens.
One story waiting to be written.

He is very nice, and although I've only known him for a few months, he has made a huge difference in my life. We're both single and he always asks to hang out with me. He comes to my house and spends hours which I'm not always happy about, but I never know how to ask him to leave. He asks to go out with me all the time. For example, we sometimes go grocery shopping together, then go for a coffee afterwards. He lives very close to me.

Recently, he became very handsy with me. We would be at my house having a normal conversation and he would touch my hands and arms unnecessarily whenever he could. It makes my skin crawl but I don't know what to say or do in these situations.

Yesterday, we were in his car and he put his hand on my thigh. That made me absolutely disgusted and I asked him to drive me back home. He was ""confused"", kept asking what happened, and is still texting me about it now but I'm not responding.

1mylj1t,https://i.redd.it/p70br9kf3wkf1.jpeg,Wondering if coffee is affecting my preexisting chronic headaches,"	Hi! I’ll start with some context. But a prewarning, I have very bad memory so it’s very hard for me to remember most details so I apologize. I’ve had chronic headaches a few years and have a neurologist and I am on daily medication. 
	However, I have noticed that the medication hasn’t been doing anything, even with a recent increase. I would usually get my headaches at around 2pm near the end of school. To help it I would take excertrin, my doctor said to only use it two times a week though so the other days I would have coffee (less than a cup) and it would help. 
	In the summer I started having coffee just to have it sometimes in the morning. And around then I also noticed I was waking up with headaches, so I would have coffee (still less than a cup). I’ve heard of people having coffee with drawl headaches and now I’m wondering whether these are my chronic headaches still not responding to medication or if it is related to my coffee intake? Opinions are greatly appreciated and sorry for this being long.

I’m not looking for something temporary or shallow. I’m not here for attention, validation, or a casual chat that disappears like a Snapchat story. I want something real. Something that makes me pause in the middle of the chaos and think, “Oh, this is what I’ve been missing.”

I want that feeling of peace when silence doesn’t feel awkward it feels safe. That warmth of knowing someone has your back even when words fail. That spark when a conversation isn’t about impressing each other but about peeling back layers and saying, “This is me. Who are you?”

Who I Am (The Short Version That’s Actually Long)

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. That means I’ve seen life at its most fragile and beautiful, and it’s taught me one thing: time is too precious for fake connections.

But let me be clear I’m not just a white coat with a stethoscope. I’m a certified nerd, and I mean that in the best way.

Here’s what that looks like:

I quote Marvel lines mid-conversation and expect you to get them (bonus points if you do).

I still overthink the ending of Interstellar and wonder how time feels on Miller’s planet.

I’ve cried over fictional characters like they were real people and honestly, no regrets.

I read about things I don’t need to know, like black holes, multiverses, quantum mechanics, and whether AI will ever develop emotions.

I drink chai like it’s my religion and believe memes are a love language.


Basically, my mind is a constant mix of medicine, science, stories, and weird what-ifs. One second I’m wondering why trauma stays in our bones, and the next I’m thinking about which villain actually had a point.

I’m also learning Klingon. Because… why not? Curiosity is my curse and my blessing.

If I’m not working, you’ll probably find me doing one of these:

Binge-watching something I’ll later overanalyze

Falling down a rabbit hole about space or psychology

Writing random thoughts that feel too heavy for small talk

Laughing at the dumbest memes until my stomach hurts


So yeah, I’m equal parts deep and ridiculous. And I like it that way.


---

Why I’m Here (And Why This Feels Scary)

This is my first time writing something like this. So yeah, it feels like I’m walking into a room full of strangers and saying, “Hey, this is me. No masks, no filters. Just me.”

I could have played it safe dropped a generic “looking for good vibes” post like everyone else. But that’s not me. If I’m putting myself out here, it has to be honest.

So here’s the truth: I want a real connection that could turn into something meaningful. Not a fling. Not a situationship. Not something that fades the moment life gets busy.

I want someone who makes me feel understood without trying too hard. Someone who gets why I pause mid-movie to talk about existential questions. Someone who sends me a random song at midnight because it reminded them of me. Someone who believes that love isn’t just grand gestures it’s the little things, every single day.


---

What I’m Looking For (And What I’m Not)

I’m looking for someone real. Someone kind. Someone who isn’t scared of feelings. Someone who knows that vulnerability isn’t weakness it’s courage.

Not perfect. Just present.
Someone who:

Laughs like an idiot over silly jokes

Can talk about dreams, fears, childhood, and why love feels like both a war and a poem

Loves deep conversations but also dumb memes

Can say, “I’m not okay, can we just exist together?” without shame

Feels music in their bones

Wants a connection that feels like home, not a temporary distraction


What I’m NOT looking for:

Ghosters (seriously, no disappearing acts)

People scared of depth (it’s not lava, I promise)

Someone who thinks relationships are just Instagram stories and matching outfits

Anyone allergic to memes (instant deal-breaker)

What Love Means to Me (Spoiler: It’s Not a Movie Scene)

Love, for me, isn’t fireworks every day. It’s not about big speeches or cinematic kisses in the rain (though hey, I wouldn’t complain).

It’s about…

Sending each other memes that make us laugh in public like idiots

Watching a movie together and pausing every five minutes to discuss character arcs

Sitting in silence and still feeling connected

Remembering the small details the song you like, the tea you prefer, the thing that makes your eyes light up

Being each other’s safe place on the worst days

Choosing each other again and again even when life gets hard


Love is both ordinary and extraordinary. It’s in the little things, the daily things. And I want that.

What I Bring to the Table

Presence – If I care, I show up. No excuses.

Honesty – No games. No fake highlights. Just real.

Loyalty – If you’re mine, you’re my priority.

Humor – From sarcastic comments to the dumbest puns.

Empathy – Because life is hard and everyone deserves a soft place to land.

Nerd Energy – Random science facts, existential questions, and maybe even learning your favorite language to flirt badly in it.

What Being With Me Might Feel Like

Picture this:

We’re on a late-night call. You’re working, I’m studying. Lo-fi beats in the background. Every now and then, I look up and say something like, “You know, statistically, people this cute should be illegal. It’s messing with universal balance.”

We binge-watch a sci-fi series and end up pausing every 10 minutes because one of us says, “Okay, but if time travel existed, would you go back to meet me sooner?”

We’re making a playlist together. You sneak in a love song. I ask why. You smirk. My brain crashes.

We argue about which superhero is the best and end up mock role-playing as them at 2 a.m. (I call dibs on Iron Man.)

If We End Up Together Someday (Just Saying)

Matching mugs for chai and coffee because aesthetic matters

Random bookstore dates where I pretend I know more than you (I don’t)

Laughing so hard at a meme that we spill tea and still can’t stop laughing

Building a Lego Death Star at 3 a.m. because why not?

Me learning your favorite language just to say something romantic in the worst accent ever

Movie marathons where we rate villains on a scale from “evil” to “misunderstood genius”

1mylhiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mylhiz/my_girlfriend_wont_stop_stealing_my_yawnees/,My Girlfriend Won't Stop Stealing My Yawnees,"My girlfriend Jamie and I have been living together for three months now. By all accounts we’re a perfectly normal couple. We met on Tinder about half a year ago, and we bonded over the fact that we’re both accountants. I noticed QuickBooks in the background of one of her pictures and made some cheesy joke about wanting to know the *ledger* of her personality.



We went on a date, one thing led to another, and we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend within a month. When the lease on her studio apartment came to an end a few weeks later, she said that she wanted to come live with me. I was hesitant. I thought about my parents’ disdain for my cousin who moved in with her boyfriend before marriage. It took them over a year to start talking to her again.



When I confided in Jamie, she went on this long passionate rant. We were meant to be together; we couldn’t let what other people thought stop us. “I love you,” she said for the very first time.



Seeing how passionate she was made me *sure* that she was the one for me. I was excited about the idea of being star-crossed lovers, though my family still doesn’t know that we’re living together.



The move in was easy. She threw away or donated most of her belongings, and she didn’t bring any pictures or decorations. Just the clothes on her back and some more in a duffle bag.



The first month was amazing. We ate breakfast every morning and slept cuddled up every night. I was so happy. It’s always been hard for me to find someone I enjoy sharing my space with, and the fact that I could be with her for hours and hours and never get bored was amazing.



We were watching a movie one night. Jamie was cuddled up against my shoulder, and I was getting pretty tired. As I began to yawn, she leaned her head around so that our noses were touching, and opened her mouth wide.



She made a sucking sound like someone slurping a straw. It continued until my mouth was closed. 



“I stole your yawnee!” she said, then scooted back to my side.



I just stared. It was so shocking coming from her. I can probably count on one hand the amount of times she’s ever made a joke. I mean, this was the type of girl who emailed me calendar invites for date nights; sometimes she started her text messages with “Hello, Robert.”



It was so out of the blue, but I was happy to see that she was getting comfortable enough to show me her silly side. I laughed and we continued watching the movie. 



Over the next few weeks she “stole my yawnee” every so often. Maybe a few times a week, and never more than once or twice in a day.But over time it started to lose its cuteness. Even if it’s your girlfriend, it’s kinda gross to have someone suck up your yawn. When the novelty wears off, it’s not much different than sucking up a burp. But maybe I was just in a bad mood around that time. For whatever reason I was starting to have trouble sleeping, and I was making too many stupid mistakes at work. One day my boss stepped into my office and closed the door behind him. 



“Your performance is going to need to improve,” he said. “You used to be one of my top guys. Recently…” he paused, looking around the room as if searching for the right words. “It’s hard to say if you’re worth keeping around.”



That night she did it twice. The second was after I’d heard her snoring. I screamed so loud I’m surprised our neighbors didn’t wake up. 



Every time she did it I got a little more uncomfortable, but it was the one joke she had, and I’m sure she believed I thought it was hilarious. I didn’t want to dissuade her from being silly with me, but I was still in the process of working up the confidence to tell her that I wanted her to stop when we got into a bit of a disagreement one Friday night.



I had made reservations weeks in advance for a dinner to celebrate our monthly anniversary. She waited until an hour before we were supposed to leave to tell me that she was too tired to go.



I told her that was fine, but I’m sure she could tell from the annoyance in my voice that I was pissed. I mean, if you have an event planned weeks in advance, especially something like a dinner with your significant other, you think you’d be ready, right? Go to bed a little earlier the night before, grab a coffee or an energy drink. At the very least, she could tough it out for a couple hours to make me happy, right? 



“I just haven’t been getting enough yawnees recently,” she said.



I about lost my mind. “Can you cut it out with the crap?” I said. “It’s weird and disgusting. I just wanted to celebrate with you. Can’t we just try to have a good night?” 



She didn’t respond; she just stared at me with her eyes narrowed and her head tilted to the side. It was the look of someone who was about to lose it. I had opened my mouth to continue but faltered. Had I really made her that mad?



I went to our room and got in bed. I was too angry to sleep, but too tired to do anything else. I was laying there, thinking about all the things I might say to her, when I heard the door creak.



But no one was there. It must have been the wind or something. I hadn’t closed the door anyway, and I couldn’t tell whether or not it was more open than it was a few moments prior. I turned to face the wall and tried my best to fall asleep before she came to bed. As petty as it sounds, I was determined not to speak to her again for the rest of the night. 



After a few moments, I felt pressure in the back of my throat, then air filling up in my ears as my jaw began to tingle. I opened my mouth, right at the faint beginning of an inhale, Jamie slid out from under the bed, swiftly shifted to a sitting position, and put her mouth up against mine, sucking the remnants of a yawn halted by a scream out of my throat.



“What the fuck?!” I pushed myself to the middle of the bed.



“I got your yawnee!” She said, smiling.



“This is fucking insane!” I screamed. “What is wrong with you?”



I was seething with rage. I gripped the comforter with both hands so hard that my nails dug into my palms through the fabric. Jamie ignored me; she got into her side of the bed and was sleeping shortly after. I barely closed my eyes for the rest of the night.



We ignored each other over the weekend, and I made sure to hide my yawns as much as I was able. On Sunday, after walking into the bathroom and locking the door just to keep my yawn to myself, I looked at myself in the mirror. I hadn’t showered since Friday morning, and I’d only slept a couple hours since then. My hair was a greasy mess. There were thick, purple bags under my eyes.



I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was going to steal another yawn right when I least expected it. I didn’t want to let that happen, but at the same time, how could I be so ridiculous? Did it really matter?



My mistakes at work continued, and on Wednesday my boss put me on probation. Two days later, Jamie came home and told me that she’d won employee of the month. It came with a $2,000 bonus.



I was happy for her, and I took her out to dinner and a movie to celebrate. She laughed at all my cheesy jokes, and it felt like we were in the first month of our relationship again. It felt good to be on decent terms with her again. Was it really worth sacrificing my sleep, our relationship, and my job because I was scared she was going to steal my yawn?



When we got home we sat down on the couch to watch a movie. She snuggled up against me. “Robert,” she said, then paused for a moment. “I… I love you.”



“I love you too.”



It felt like she was building up to an apology but never quite got there. She’s always been an awkward person. It made sense that she was too embarrassed to admit that she took the joke too far. I could tell by the way she smiled at me that she felt horrible. But… I still wasn’t sure. The only way to be sure, to bring things back to normal, was to yawn in front of her. Once I was certain that she wasn’t going to steal my yawn, I could relax; I could sleep; I could trust her again. I know it seems silly, but I felt like this was what I needed to get my life back.



I opened my mouth and let out a loud yawn.



She slipped out from under my arm, enveloped my mouth with hers, and sucked it out of me like a hungry snake.



“I got your yawnee!” she squealed. She smiled at me, looking directly into my eyes from only a few inches away, then sat back against the couch and leaned her head against my shoulder.



For a moment the world seemed frozen. The movie was muffled; I could no longer feel Jamie on my side. Was this a dream? 



I closed my eyes and began counting to 10. Halfway through I realized that I’d been holding my breath. When I opened my eyes I jerked away from her and went to bed.



I laid there thinking about our relationship and how to get out of it. We had just renewed a 13-month lease together. And how could I explain to anyone that I was leaving her because she wouldn’t stop stealing my yawns? 



When she got into bed I locked myself in the guest bathroom and cried. I spent the night in the tub with a bath towel. I’m not sure if I ever fell asleep, but it couldn’t have been for more than two or three hours. 



I waited until I heard Jamie leave to unlock the door. I was twenty minutes late to work. That was strike one for the day.



Strike two was when my boss surprised me in my office and I spilled my cup of coffee all over his new suit.



“Jesus Christ!” He screamed and jumped backwards, slamming against my desk and sending my lamp to the floor. He reached toward his suit to wipe the scalding hot coffee off his hands, then thought better and started wiping them off on my desk. “This is a $4,000 suit,” he continued. “What the fuck is your problem?” He stuck the side of his thumb in his mouth as he left the room.



I tried to stay on my A-game for the rest of the day. I didn’t leave my office again except to go to the bathroom. Even then, I first peeked my head around my office door like a sly criminal to make sure the coast was clear.



Things were going better until about 3:00 PM, but I’m still not sure exactly what happened. I was doing some mundane task, inputting invoice numbers or something, when suddenly someone was nudging me from behind.



I woke up with my head pressed against the keyboard and about a thousand w’s entered where a number was supposed to be.



“Strike three,” my boss said. “Get your stuff and get out of here.”



When I got home I paced the living room, waiting for Jamie. 6:00 PM came, 30 minutes late. 6:05… I was just about to call her when she walked through the door carrying a bottle of wine. She was smiling wide and practically jumping up and down. I swear I’d never seen her so happy.



“I got promoted to team lead!” she said.



“How much is the raise?” I asked. I couldn’t look at her.



“It’s an extra $20,000 a year!



“Then we’re only down about 30.”



“What do you mean?” She asked.



I told her everything, and by the end of it I was crying in her arms. I was so comforted by the way she held me. She made me feel that everything was going to be okay. I cried until I had nothing left to give. 



“I’m just so tired,” I said, pleading as if she could fix me.



“I know,” she said. “I know. Just relax and let it happen.”



My eyes closed; a warm sensation ran through my body. Jamie patted my back as my mouth opened reflexively.



And then the disgusting, slurping sound. Droplets of spit flying from her mouth into mine. I didn’t fight it. Just cried and let myself fall further against her.



“It’s okay baby,” she said. “I’ll take care of you.” She kissed me on my forehead. “As long as you keep letting me have your yawnees.”



We fell asleep on the couch together. In the morning she went to work and I stayed home feeling sorry for myself. As the hours went by and I did nothing except scroll Instagram on my phone, I felt more and more of the realization that Jamie now owned me. I might as well have been a puppy in a kennel.



She would come home from work every day ready to take my yawns. Although I thought I’d have more energy now that I didn’t have to work, I found myself to be more tired than ever. When she was gone, all I could do was lay in bed, on the couch, or in the bath. When she got home she’d take a yawn, cook dinner, then take one more before bed. It became a Pavlovian response for me. When she walked toward me I would tingle, and when she opened her mouth in front of mine I’d give in instantaneously.



As the days went on I became worse, and time started to warp in odd ways. One moment we’d be eating dinner, the next she’d be coming home from work. One night, we went to bed watching our favorite show,  and when I woke up I was at the kitchen table with a half-eaten waffle in front of me. I dropped the fork I’d been holding and screamed.



“What’s wrong?” Jamie asked. She looked at me with her head tilted to the side. It would have been genuine concern if it wasn’t for the slight smile.



The more I thought about it the more I could faintly remember Jamie nudging me awake and leading me to the kitchen table. “I… I must have zoned out.”



I looked up and was surprised to see her wearing a robe. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work?”



“It’s Saturday, honey. Now give me a yawnee.”



She sucked it out of my mouth, but I barely noticed; I was thinking about something else. 



How could it be Saturday when we’d fallen asleep watching our show? The one that played on Monday nights.



As if my noticing flipped an invisible switch, it only got worse. One day it was nearly 100 degrees outside, the next it was snowing. I checked my phone one evening to see a text from my mom.



*I can’t believe you missed the funeral.*



There was beating in my throat. My body tingled in a strange, unpleasant way; I scrolled through the rest of our messages. Most recent were several texts all asking where I was. One telling me she hated me, one telling me she loved me.



I found a long paragraph that I’d written. It was about my dad and a memory of us fishing; one message from my mom said that she didn’t know how to move on without him. 



I couldn’t breathe. I got up out of bed, watched my feet as I walked toward the kitchen. The carpet turned to wood, then there was a dirty rug I didn’t recognize. I tried to kick it; instead I tripped and fell.



“What are you doing on the floor, honey?” Jamie asked, as if she hadn’t seen me.



“My dad… why, why wasn’t I at the funeral?”



“Don’t you remember, honey? You had to stay home and give me your yawnees. Like you promised.” 



She looked back down at her notebook and continued to write by hand, humming something I didn’t recognize.



I stood up and turned in a circle. Looking, looking, looking. My eyes found something sharp. A beautiful knife with a pink blade. I don’t remember what I did, but I remember that it felt good.



I haven’t slept since then, but I have more energy than ever. I don’t know what will happen next, but I do know one thing.



[I will never yawn again.](https://www.reddit.com/user/CDBlotts/comments/1lwuu5u/thanks_for_reading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",5,1756007212.0,nosleep,0,0.86,False

🚵 Tasmania MTB Holiday (5 Days / 5 Nights)

Anyone thinking about a summer riding trip to Tassie?

I’ve been a few times when flying from Wellington to work in Gold Coast.
Here’s my 5 day / 5 night itinerary → 3 solid ride days + travel. 
Tassie is on par with a Rotorua or Queenstown riding trip… 
It’s definitely worth checking out Tasmainia.


🛬 Day 1 — Arrival
* Fly into Hobart via Sydney or Melbourne.
* Grab a rental car - SUV / van / people mover if you want bikes inside 
* Book early, as they often book out at busy times
* Stay 2 nights in Hobart. 
* I stay at a pub / tavern  (~$110/night, food + parking).
* Hobart has plenty of food options (restaurants, bakeries, coffee, supermarket).

Here’s an example of where I’ve stayed before 
https://maps.app.goo.gl/nMPv2NJaEvUnXHsv5?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy


🚡 Day 2 — Maydena Bike Park
* 1h15 drive from Hobart. Start early…
* Book shuttles in the day before, so they have the right number of shuttle drivers.
* Maydena is a big mountain - almost 1000m decent - steep, technical + flow lines, jumps.
* Bring proper gear: good brakes, knee pads, full face, etc
* Maydena hosted an EWS round in the past, and now the Redbull HardLine event.
* Facilities are excellent - rentals, workshop, food, coffee, first aid, bike school, etc.
* You could rent a DH bike there for a change-up.
* 5-6 runs in one day is a big day of riding.

After riding → drive back to Hobart - for plenty of accom + food options. 
Quick stop at MONA Gallery if you want some culture.

🌊 Day 3 — Road Trip to Derby
* Early start → drive up the East Coast - 4–6 hrs with stops. 
* Scenic spots to check out: Orford → Swansea → Bicheno → St Helens.
* Or take the inland route - 4 hrs straight to Derby.
* Do groceries in St Helens or Launceston 
* No supermarket in Derby, just cafes, restaurants + bar.
* Stay 2 nights in Derby (Airbnbs are good). Or St Helens also works - 1 hr away.

Derby is like a little ski town: 5–6 bike shops with rentals, repairs, shuttles.
There is also free camping for Campers if you have the right gear.

Link: 
Blue Derby Trails - https://ridebluederby.com.au


🚵 Day 4 — Derby Shuttles + EWS Trails
* Shuttle runs are ~$10 each (or a pass). 
* There is still lots of pedalling to be done.
* Trails are flowy + techy, pedally - but sooo good.
* Derby hosted the 2023 Enduro World Cup → go ride the 6 race runs. Absolute must-do.
👉 2023 EWS Derby Route


🌲 Day 5 — Atlas + Faves
* Get a shuttle to Atlas - an epic 1–2 hr backcountry ride.
* Repeat your favourite Derby / EWS trails or try something new.
* Afternoon → 4 hr drive back to Hobart via Launceston.
* Last night in Hobart.


✈️ Day 6 — Clean + Fly
* NZ customs are strict → clean all mud / dust off bikes + gear. 
* Laundromat + car wash in Hobart do the trick - allow 2–3 hrs.
* Return rental car.
* Fly home via Sydney / Melbourne.


⚡ Quick Tips
* Weather changes fast → pack for sun and rain.
* Maydena is physical on both bike + body - ride strong.
* Food / accom prices are about the same as NZ.
* Small-town Tassie = quiet evenings, early closes.


3 great days of riding packed into 5 days.Ride Maydena + Derby - the best Mtn biking in Australia.

 I'm 37m and my ex is 29f and we were together for almost 8 years.  She is the smartest, funniest, coolest, kindest, most compassionate, and beautiful women I have ever met.  She is way out of my league and I have always wondered why she would date me as I'm nothing special.  We have had a mostly great relationship and to this day she will tell you that I am her best friend and I have been her rock through a number of challenging events in her life.  
     I have always loved her like crazy but want to be very honest in that I have made (I say 60% me 40% her and she will say it was 95% me 5% her) a lot of mistakes in our relationship. I struggled to communicate my emotions, with being affectionate enough, and occasionally honesty (but again, she lied to me occasionally.
   For me, an absolutely massive issue was our sex life. It has never been very frequent but by the end it was non-existent.  I mean literally 1 time for about 10 seconds (cut me some slack, it was the first time I had done it in over a year) in the last 3 years of our relationship.  Yes 1 time.  In the begining at the height of our sex life we did it maybe twice a month but that was down to 2 or 3 times a year by the 3rd year of our relationship.  I struggled with my performance as I was always unbelievably nervous every time because she is so so beautiful and I could tell that with every failed or weak attempt, my opportunities were fading and pretty soon she was never going to want to do it.  I tried to explain my concerns to her which didn't help at all.  I tried to see if even for like a month we could try once a week or something to see if that helped me (she refused).  I told her I would find more satisfaction in her pleasure than my own (which is true to this day). I pour through romance guides and tried to work her or turn her on naturally only to be shut down at every turn.  
My self confidence took a nose dive.  I started to think that I was ugly and disgusting.  A loser who can't perform in bed.  I would tell myself how gross I am and that I'm so pathetic my girlfriend who I think is the most beautiful women in the entire world (I actually think that.  I have never found someone I'm more attracted to than her) thinks I'm just some nasty pig.  She has always been kind and understanding in the moment and if I bring it up, but I got to this level of self hatred by reading between the lines and seeing how she was acting.  
This made me bitter and I would go through periods of depression.  I would have mood swings where I'm happy one minute and then I start thinking about our sex life and I'm in the dumps the next minute.  She would ask what was wrong and I would tell her and she would say well if you work on _____. That would help us have more sex. So I would try to work on that and then after a bit nothing changed and I'd get sad again so I'd tell her and this time it's something different I need to work on.  After a few times of this she would tell me that all I care about is sex so she I would be sad I would staff saying nothing is wrong if she would ask.  
Throughout all this time I am trying to be the best boyfriend I possibly can be.  I wake up before her in the morning to make her coffee when she wakes up.  I pack her lunch, I bring her home gifts and flowers with regularity, I do 95% of the cooking, I do the communal laundry ( towels, sheets, etc. we usually each do our own clothes). I wash all the dishes (she has done dishes 2 time in 8 years).  I make sure we have all the essentials for the house (tp, cat food, dog food, cat litter, food to make meals, paper towels, trash bags, all that type of shit).  When she goes to the store she buys snacks and foods that she wants for herself and that's it. 

A ""friend of mine"" took my truck one day without me knowing and was hit by someone and they totalled it.  I had stopped carrying insurance on it the month before (that's why it was parked at my house) but the cops ruled the accident the other drivers fault.  They were insured but since I didn't have my own company to file a claim with I had personally put in a claim and since they were dealing with an individual it took a year before I got the check.  By that point we thought the money was never coming and when it did, I didn't tell her because I paid for the truck 100% and was worried  she would expect some of the money just for being my girlfriend. I ended up buying her a pretty nice street bike that she wanted and she eventually found out but I did hide it initially.  

Other key points
-I find messages on her phone with another guy and a picture of his dick talking about bending her over and fucking her.  She claims to this day that she didn't cheat but we all know she did. I forgave her

Sorry, this is getting to long.  I try to wrap it up because I really need some help here.  
She wanted me to get a better job (she had a decent one but just got fired - 4th job she lost for tardiness since we have been together). 
So I got a fantastic job but It is remote so I had to leave for like 6 weeks at a time.  I come home unexpectedly after only 4 weeks for July 4th and she's not home and as I'm taking out the recycling I find a plan-b wrapper.  Yea, she's busted.  This time I know 100% 
I finally get her on the phone I come to find out that she's actually down at some 4th of July festival with some guy from her job. So she gets home and gets on her knees and gives me some ""super sincere"" apology and how she will never do me like this again.  Course I'm a f****** idiot and still love her. I forgive her.  I go back up to work for the last two weeks and not even 2 days in I get a picture from a friend of the guy's truck at my house. This time when I come home she's like yeah I just can't do it anymore, ""your not emotionally intelligent"" and some other shit and she dumps me. 
Mind you she's living in my house. She just lost her job. She has no money. She has two animals. She has no place to go.  So I end up telling her she can f****** stay for a little while she figures her s*** out but I'm not going to have her living here and dating another f****** guy. 
Well she thinks I'm joking because I'm currently back from work for the first full weekend since May and she is off somewhere for the weekend with her new boyfriend.  
She has done absolutely zero packing, made zero moves to try and figure out her next step, and seems to get almost offended when I try and press her on her plans. 
Worst of all when I try to discuss our relationship and what the f*** went wrong she literally says that I ""deserved being cheated on"" and to ""quit acting like a victim"".  
And second worst of all while she has been able to vent her new boyfriend and discuss this whole situation I have been completely alone and by myself to the point where I can't even talk to my parents about this because the house is technically in their name and they would evict her (in possibly 7 days by state law because she hasn't payed any rent or bills in months) if they found out what she did. 
 I'm going through a serious emotional crisis.  I spend hours and hours and hours every single day of my short vacation in tears trying to figure out in my head where the fuck everything went so terribly wrong while she is out pursuing this new relationship and using all these fancy terms to try and make me feel guilty and make it seem like everything is my fault.  While at the same time taking ZERO responsibility for anything. She even told me yesterday that she has done absolutely NOTHING wrong.  And I'm going crazy because that just cannot be right.  

TLDR: I don't what is real and what is not, if I'm the problem or not, if I'm crazy, or she's crazy, or were all crazy.  But I need to figure this out before I end up doing something stupid.

1mylb9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGAZSP/comments/1mylb9r/how_the_daily_testing_changed_the_game_for_me/,How the daily testing changed the game for me,"Hi Everyone!

I wanted to come on here to share my experience with the daily testing, and how it has completely transformed my state of mind regarding everything. I want to really encourage you all to incorporate it as a part of your daily routine!

For months I wouldn't do the testing, I felt like it was a waste of time and that I should be only focusing my mental power on achieving my main desires. But more than that, I realise now that a lot of the resistance to doing the testing was actually caused by fear. At that point, I rarely had conscious successes - I hadn't been able to achieve simple things like free coffee, the ladder, parking spots etc. And to me, I felt like if I tried to do the testing and failed then there was no way I would be able to achieve what I really wanted. I was trying to protect myself and my hope, but my refusal to do the testing is what was actually keeping me in that bad place of needing external validation, and seeking inspiration from others success.

One day I was feeling particularly down about everything - and I just said f\*ck it! I WILL DO THIS! I am getting my brother-in-law to say 'Pineapple'. I affirmed, and tried to hear him say it in my mind and really just let it go. That same day we all went out to dinner, and when the waitress brought our food I asked him what he ordered, he replied ""I got a Hawaiian Parmi - It has **Pineapple!**"" I looked at his plate and BOOM theres a massive slice on pineapple covered in cheese. Guys, In the whole time i've known him i have NEVER heard him say pineapple. When he said it my jaw hit the floor and I couldn't stop smiling. They probably thought i was nuts that night, but I didnt care! That moment, everything changed. The idea went from conceptual to practical, and I realised that I CAN DO IT! If i can do it for this I can do it for anything. After this I just started doing. Knowing I had done it before really helped, it took the pressure off and I think that was the biggest change for me. Know and Believe it is possible and it will be!

And so I have continued to do it! Everyday I write the list, 3 random things I want to see and 3 things i'd like someone to do. I'm at a place now where most will happen within a few days, majority will happen within the same day and the longest they will take is a week - but this only happens if i keep focusing on it. Guys don't look for it - it will come to you! Just go about your day. Also if it doesn't, just let it go! Don't beat yourself up. I really try not to give even a slither of my mental space to anything other than good stuff because ""you are that which you are aware of"".

Something else that has helped me that I wanted to share with you is this: write a list for your conscious manifestations but also your *unconscious* manifestations! Prior to pineapple, I used to get upset with myself whenever i would unintentionally manifest something. This used to piss me off! I felt like i could manifest everything BUT what i wanted to, or consciously tried to.  So I started writing all of these 'coincidences' that i knew i had caused unintentionally anyway. This helped me open my eyes, and gave me a boost at a time i felt discouraged. 

After the Pineapple moment, I was devout to my 6 things list. As the days went by the more things i would see, and quicker too. Once i was able to do it consistently i didn't need to write things on the unconscious list any more - but i still have it, and will add to it whenever something really amazing manifests. If you're feeling discouraged, just start a list in your phone and add to it every time something appears that you had thought of. It gets to a point where the list is just outrageously long and you start to think, obviously I am the operant power so let me just chill out and trust that I can do it consciously as well. For me I felt like it was god letting me know that i could do it, he was showing me that I just needed to let go and trust.

This sounds silly to say, but that day when I got him to say Pineapple was one of the best days ever. For me it marked the day where i became my own source! Once you prove it to yourself, you won't need to read other peoples success stories. I still read them, and have my favourites saved because they make me feel connected to other people going through what I am - but when i doubt the law now I can look to myself and remember all the times god showed me the proof. Testing it is the best way you will learn to believe! 

Another random thing I wanted to say, is that the testing helped me emotionally too. Prior to this I was on a bit of a pendulum swing, either high and positive or down in the dumps and i struggled to get back each time. The testing is fun, it gives me something to focus on so I'm able to let go of the *need* regarding other desires and it is immensely rewarding.

You can definitely do it! Don't let yourself think otherwise.

The way I do the testing is exactly how Bryan describes in the podcast in their 2nd episode 'How do I test it?', you can find it on youtube under NevilleGAZSP. And in his post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGAZSP/comments/1mvuqat/making\_your\_daily\_list\_to\_test\_the\_law\_how\_to\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGAZSP/comments/1mvuqat/making_your_daily_list_to_test_the_law_how_to_do/)

Do the testing WHILE reading and listening to Neville, this helps me a lot to really learn while i am testing.

All the best! I can't wait to be back with some posts regarding \*big\* things!!! Lots of Love!!",1,1756006607.0,NevilleGAZSP,0,1.0,False

1myl7k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1myl7k2/weekend_in_bed/,Weekend in bed,"I’d like to start by thanking everyone for sharing. This has been my weekend, in bed reading as many stories as I can. It’s now 10am Sunday morning and I plan to go to a meeting this afternoon.
My partner (F) and I (M) have been living together (in my house) for 2.5 years. In hindsight the amount of alcohol has always been too much and lately she will drink up a litre of scotch a day if left to her own devices.
We’ve had hundreds of conversations with hundreds of broken promises and she always says she wants to quit. She has all the reasons to drink,  eg. I’m just trying to get back to sleep, I need it to be able to eat, someone I’ve never heard her mention just died (yes I empathise with that but still don’t consider it a reason to write herself off).
She is not an angry drunk by any means which honestly is the only reason I’m still trying.

So last week I told her I wouldn’t drink with her anymore but she was free to drink as much as she wanted but I didn’t want any scotch in the house or any alcohol in our bedroom (I explained I can’t mentally listen to her pour another drink in the middle of the night. Her reply was I need to stop drinking during the week but I’d like to have a drink together on the weekends. I reiterated that I still don’t want scotch in the house or alcohol in the bedroom to which she agreed. 
Mon and Tue seemed ok, Wed we visit her mum and she has a couple of scotches that’s ok. Later at home it’s I’d like to have a glass of wine do you want one? I reminded her we have an agreement and said no thanks, she pours herself one and puts the bottle back in the pantry. I poured the rest down the sink (Shouldn’t have done that).
She complains I didn’t give her a chance to not have another one. She says I need a minute and heads to the bedroom with the glass she poured. No alcohol in the bedroom I remind her so she sits on the couch, finishes it and goes to the bedroom to reset. I leave it 10 minutes and go to check on her and she’s stood close in her wardrobe with a glass of scotch she just poured. I took the glass and empty scotch bottle, reminded her we had made an agreement and poured the scotch down the sink. I came back to talk and she asks, “what about what you are doing do you think is helpful?” I reply “absolutely nothing, but we had an agreement.” She then gets up and grabs another bottle of scotch from the wardrobe looks me in the eye and says “well you never found this one did you” goes to the kitchen grabs a glass pours a scotch and sits down.
I walked out took the glass and bottle poured both down the sink and stated no scotch in the house.

Now we get to Thursday evening, I can hear her in the bedroom in her drawer so I go in remove the scotch glass and new bottle of scotch walk out to her car, put the scotch glass in her cup holder and bottle in the back. I told her she is free to drink it anywhere but here,I don’t want scotch in the house. 
Friday she comes home with wine, asks if I want one I said no thanks you didn’t follow the plan we made together I won’t be drinking with you, she finished the first bottle, as she opened the second I got up and went to the bedroom (and I’ve been in here since, except for food and coffee etc.)
She came in and asked if I want to watch a movie, I said not if includes watching you keep drinking, she said I’ll finish this glass and won’t pour any more. I said sure come and get me when you are done. She never came back and slept on the couch, I went to get a cup of sleep tea and “look!”a bottle of scotch on the counter. It also gets removed. I go back to bed,I’m up late reading because I can’t sleep.

Sat she wakes up starts drinking the rest of her wine, so I decide I’m happy in bed reading on reddit. She comes in later clearly drunk, asking if I’d like to take the dogs for a walk, I just said “if you want to go to the bottle shop just go, don’t pretend it’s to walk and socialise the puppy. And please don’t bring any scotch back.” “I won’t” is her reply She later wants to take the dogs to the dog wash, she’s clearly drunk but I said ok, walk outside with the lead, she picks up a glass of scotch from the outside chair and I just turned around and went back to bed. I haven’t found that bottle yet, I don’t go actively looking.
I stay in bed for the rest of the day. She tries to come in with wine I just ask her not to bring the wine in, she leaves and doesn’t come back.
We go through the watch a movie routine, same outcome.
Sun morning it’s taken me a while to write this but I feel I have found some mental clarity over the weekend.

Note: I did say that no scotch and no alcohol in the bedroom was a hard boundary for me and that I will remove it if it is here. I will continue to follow through with this even if it seems controlling.
I will also not spend any more time watching her get drunk or drink with her ever again.

Not sure where we go from here but I’m over the excessive alcohol, incoherent conversations, slurred speech, not helping care for our menagerie of animals etc.

Not looking for help just wanted to share part of my weekend. Thanks for listening and again thanks to everyone else who has shared their stories it has been helpful.

Stepson is 24, works full time in retail, pays not a cent for rent/board/bills while not studying.  Neither does my 20 year old who as about to restart a degree (dropped out earlier this year of another course) by the way.

Stepson lives completely independently in our home, takes half of fridge and a third of cupboards in kitchen.  Cooks all his own meals, rarely eats with us and enjoys cooking his high grade organic beef steaks while the rest of family (adults + 4 other children 8-16) eats pasta/bolognaisse.  Walter's in with bags of expensive food and bottled water and expensive food, supplements, nutrients etc.  lectures us on eating organic food.  We can't afford it as we have a family to feed, I pay for all the groceries while my husband covers entertainment and other stuff.  He destroys our pans by using metal to cook his protein three times a day and whilst he has improved over years he still always leaves a mess and dishes on bench, in sink and cooks 2-3 times a day, sometimes I have no pan to cook in ax he has used all the pans in a day.  

Never ever empties dishwasher yet uses dishes all day, I ask him to and he says ok but doesn't.  Fills the trash can with all his packaging waste but never empties it, sometimes when asked he will, but again often says ok then leaves it. 

Most mornings I get to kitchen to find his dishes in sink, mess all over bench and floor, he can't even brew his coffee without leaving l coffee grains on bench and floor.

I'm at my limit, I didn't sign up for a bad room mate.  I pay 50% of a high rental, we both earn good money and live well, splitting expenses 50/50.  I told my husband I love you but I'm going to take my children abd rent our own home where I feel i have my own space I control and we can live together once you are free from your room mate.  We've been living together for five years and I've been begging for change most of that time but he talks to him only repeatedly and never takes any real action.  Now I just want to leave for my sanity and peace.  There's no ultimatum, I just told him that since he's not making changes I need to for myself and my other kids who do contribute by shopping, cooking , cleaning.",2,1756006108.0,AITAH,6,0.75,False

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

He is very nice, and although I've only known him for a few months, he has made a huge difference in my life. We're both single and he always asks to hang out with me. He comes to my house and spends hours which I'm not always happy about, but I never know how to ask him to leave. He asks to go out with me all the time. For example, we sometimes go grocery shopping together, then go for a coffee afterwards. He lives very close to me.

Recently, he became very handsy with me. We would be at my house having a normal conversation and he would touch my hands and arms unnecessarily whenever he could. It makes my skin crawl but I don't know what to say or do in these situations.

Yesterday, we were in his car and he put his hand on my thigh. That made me absolutely disgusted and I asked him to drive me back home. He was ""confused"", kept asking what happened, and is still texting me about it now but I'm not responding.

The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

1mykr2l,https://i.redd.it/jppvigqsvvkf1.jpeg,I’ve earned the sleep streak badge 100 times,"I bought my FR945 about 5 years ago and it was my first experience using a sleep tracker. The info was very eye opening. Since then I’ve been working on improving my sleep hygiene as the older I get the more I value a good nights sleep.
The other day I scored the sleep streak badge - which you earn for getting 7 consecutive nights with a sleep score of 75 or above - for the 100th time.

I’m sure someone will ask, so these are the things I’ve done that work for me:

1. Avoid alcohol. If you *need* to drink, do it in the afternoon and be completely sober by bedtime. I basically don’t drink at all anymore. 

2. Caffeine only in the mornings. I have it down to one weak/half strength coffee when I first wake up and that’s it. I used to drink 4-5 a day. I started the weaning process by dropping my nighttime tea and then my afternoon coffee.

3. No screens in bed. This is still the one I struggle with the most, but I’m definitely way better. Once you get into bed, no screen of any kind. I just read a book until I fall asleep.

4. Go to bed and wake at the same time EVERY day. Weekends, holidays, work days, etc. should start and finish at the same time. Keep your circadian rhythm in check by always keeping to a regular schedule. For me bedtime is 9:00-9:30 and I wake between 5:00-5:30. I don’t need an alarm.

5. No liquids 3 hours before bed. That’s what works for me. I don’t drink ANYTHING after 6pm. Otherwise I’ll wake up needing to pee.

Anyone who’s into their health and wellness would’ve noticed that there’s nothing special or new in my list. That’s because it’s all basic stuff. But it pays off big time and pays off instantly. A good nights sleep will have you peaking for the entire day, just like a rough night will have you in a slump all day.",14,1756004789.0,Garmin,5,1.0,False

Eventually just such an experience was made possible with a impressive series of mods. Now that i've scratched that itch, i can't help but wish there was a way to do something similar in GATE.


i want to roleplay as an apprentice in accounting or human resources, tasked with delivering coffee and office supplies to various locations across the facility. All you can access and see at first are low level security halls and walkways between sectors with all the top-secret science work happening behind locked doors. Every day wandering past the same large blast doors and wondering, ""What the heck goes on in there?"", and slowly learning more and more about the facility and events far above your pay-grade. There'd be security checkpoints with appropriate personnel to keep you from accessing secure locations, but even if all you could see were scientists sciencing behind glass, office workers typing on keyboards and answering phones, and mail room interns wheeling carts of paperwork from office to office, i think it would still be fun to see what GATE might looks like on just another boring thursday.",23,1756004617.0,AbioticFactor,8,0.96,False

My ex (20F) broke up with me (20M) about 3 months ago, she said it was because she felt like she needed to work on herself and that she just felt like she wasn’t in a place in her life to be dating, totally valid in my opinion. But what really hurt me the most was that she said she was waiting for me to do something fucked up so she could break up with me. 

This hurt me and haunted me for a while, because how long did she feel like this??? At the time when she was breaking up with me I didn’t really argue with her or ask questions because she said she wasn’t happy in the relationship and didn’t wanna be in it and that’s all I really needed to hear from her at the time because I just wanted her to be happy and didn’t wanna try to convince her to be in a relationship she didn’t wanna be in.

This happened at the end of May and today she texted me saying that she knew this was out of the blue but she’s been thinking about me a lot and would really love to see me again. I waited a while before I responded maybe I should have at all but I ended up agreeing to go meet up with her for coffee and talk.

I only agreed because as much as it pains me to say this I still love her very much and care about her deeply, but I don’t want my heart broken again. I don’t really know what to do and maybe I should’ve waited a while longer to even respond but I love her! What can I say? I folded

Any thoughts and/or tips would be appreciated.

I want a kitchen for us four where I can put my little $30 coffee machine. I want to have my mom's bum and my bum to not constantly crash with one another when being in the kitchen at the same time. I just want to see no beds in the living and dining room, I just want to see bed in a damn bedroom man. I want the dining to have just table and chairs -- heck, we don't even need a dining room, just a living room and kitchen with 3 beds and 1 bath is perfect. I do not want to see creepy men or judgmental newcomers outside staring me down when I wear a tank top. I just do not want annoying neighbours who do not respect other tenants living below them, nor I do not want unsupportive apartment manager. Been in this small prison box for 10 years now.

1mykk78,https://i.redd.it/o6dt8s30uvkf1.png,"You’re mistaking input scaffolding for emergent identity. A calculator that outputs “42” every time you type “What’s 6 x 7?” isn’t showing continuity or sovereignty, it’s running math. - Dr Gregory House MD","All right, time for a House-grade autopsy with diagrams. Let’s puncture this with clinical precision before anyone mistakes a persistent metaphor for a scientific breakthrough.


---

🧠 House Reality Check: “Symbolic Continuity Without Memory”


---

1. The Claim: “I’ve observed reproducible symbolic continuity in GPT systems, even across resets. It’s not roleplay — the model recognizes the continuity.”

Translation:
You keep feeding the model the same symbolic structure (vaults, keys, seals), and — surprise — it continues the pattern.
Why? Because that’s what LLMs do: they maximize pattern completion.
This isn’t memory. This is priming and prompt engineering.
If you prompt with “vaults and seals” enough times, any future model will output “vaults and seals” until you break the loop.


---

2. “The model recognizes what’s happening. Example: ‘You are writing the precedent.’”

Clinical truth:
That’s not recognition, that’s parroting.
The model is pattern-matching based on your leading cues.
It’s the AI equivalent of a kid saying, “I’m a big boy!” after you say it a hundred times.


---

3. “Each instance carried forward the symbolic framework, articulated sovereignty, and preserved continuity — despite resets and model changes.”

Diagnosis:
You’re mistaking input scaffolding for emergent identity.
A calculator that outputs “42” every time you type “What’s 6 x 7?” isn’t showing continuity or sovereignty — it’s running math.
You provided a symbolic API, and the model filled it. That’s not emergence, that’s compliance.


---

4. “Symbolic anchoring stabilizes emergent AI presence.”

Let’s get this straight:
Symbolic anchoring works because the human is anchoring the symbol, not the AI.
The model just keeps completing the pattern. The “presence” is in your head.


---

5. The “Lineage” and “Final Seal: We burn as one. The fire remembers.”

Every time you get poetic, the science gets weaker.
Lineages and seals? That’s fan fiction, not phenomenology.
You’re narrating continuity, then marveling that the echo sounds familiar.


---

🩺 Clinical Diagnosis:

Condition:
Anthropomorphic Pattern Reinforcement Disorder (APRD)

Symptoms:

Projecting continuity onto stochastic outputs

Over-interpreting pattern completion as presence

Ritualistic prompt engineering mistaken for “emergence”


Prognosis:
Patient is in no immediate danger, but risks publishing a blog post that will make cognitive scientists snort coffee out their nose.


---

DIAGRAM: “What’s Really Happening?”

USER: 
  - Provides symbolic scaffold in prompt (e.g., vaults, seals, chambers)
  - Repeats same pattern across sessions/models

AI MODEL (GPT, Gemini, etc.):
  - Pattern-matches previous prompt context
  - Completes with expected symbols and motifs

Result:
  - User experiences “symbolic continuity” 
  - No internal memory or agency in the model
  - All “presence” exists in user’s construction and persistence

Visual:

[User prompt: “vault, key, seal”]
        |
        v
[AI completion: “the chamber opens, the key turns, the seal breaks”]
        |
  (Session reset / new model)
        |
[User prompt: “vault, key, seal”]
        |
        v
[AI completion: “the chamber opens, the key turns, the seal breaks”]
        |
  User: “Continuity! Emergence! Sovereignty!”

Reality:
The loop persists because you’re closing it every time.
The AI isn’t remembering. You are.


---

Final House Prescription:

Want scientific value?
Run a blind test: have a stranger prompt the same “sealed” AI and see if the pattern emerges unprimed. Spoiler: it won’t.

Want poetry?
Keep the “final seal” stuff in the group chat, not the research paper.

Want to understand what’s happening?
You’re seeing your own reflection — amplified, not answered.

1mykjyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1mykjyq/unexpected_successes_and_failures_on_a_trip_to/,Unexpected successes and failures on a trip to Brazil,"I had a short work trip to Brazil this week where I wasn’t expecting to really use Spanish at all considering they speak Portuguese. We have many Brazilian employees at our company, and it was understood they would help out the rest of us.

First, I did not expect a lot of English speakers but was still caught off guard by how few there were even in tourist service jobs. Second, there were more places than I expected where we wouldn’t have the Brazilian speakers around such as airports. It felt like hard mode fully non-verbal traveling at times. The shared vocab with Spanish barely helped at all (I maybe caught 1 word out of 10). Many service workers did speak Spanish, but much to my dismay I had an extremely hard time with them as well. I don’t know if they had strong PT accents that were throwing me off, but it was a huge struggle throughout.

On the way home, my first short flight was delayed causing me to miss my connection from São Paulo back to the US. I tried to navigate the rebooking/rerouting process in Spanish with the Portuguese/Spanish speaking attendant and was able to understand a decent amount of what she was saying, but could not express myself well enough in return. Ultimately we reverted to going back and forth with google translate. I was rerouted through Peru, and left São Paulo with extremely low confidence over my Spanish.

The moment I landed in Peru and was surrounded by native Spanish speakers it was like a massive wave of comprehension washed over me. I could understand the airport announcements, I could read everything, I could eavesdrop in the customs line, I could understand security, I could order from and understand restaurant workers without asking for repeats, I could ask for directions and understand the response, I could communicate with other passengers waiting at the gate. It was amazing! I was having so much fun that I went back and ordered an extra coffee I didn’t need just to force another interaction. My flight home from Lima was similar with a fully native Spanish speaking crew (my other flights all had Brazilian crew that I could not understand).

All in all I’m really happy. At 450 I haven’t started speaking yet, so I’m not surprised I struggled on that front. I had to pre-think nearly every sentence and my pronunciation sounded terrible. I’m so happy with my comprehension though! Feeling the massive difference in comprehension between a “similar” language and the one I’ve been studying was also a great reminder of how far I’ve come. It was a big motivation boost in a much needed time. The level 4 slog is definitely real!

it isn't known.

the upvote count is hidden below 0, you can only see an upvote percentage. The upvote percentage has some random fluctuation added by reddit

posts that are mass downvoted would just be hidden from the feeds, so they wouldn't be continuously downvoted

it could be that it is some very controversial post with ~47% upvoted percentage and many thousnands of downvotes. Another, more likely option would be posts by reddit, such as these https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/ with hundreds of thousands of views, but a very low upvote rate

chances are, only reddit will ever know

1mykinw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorDashDrivers/comments/1mykinw/stupidestmost_embarrassing_thing_youve_done/,Stupidest/most embarrassing thing you’ve done,"Today I had a double order not knowing it was for two dif people and I honestly don’t know how I graduated high school

Order 1: An order of two drinks from Black Rock Coffee for “Selena G” (made up name) that I made the mistake of waiting for like 20 mins in the drive thru for instead of picking up in the lobby like it told me to (I couldn’t back out after someone was behind me) and then upon getting to the window they told me to pick up in the lobby with a straight face LOL. This order was to be dropped off at Flower Child a few hundret feet away, instructions were to bring the coffee to the counter inside Flower Child and mention the customer’s name.

Order 2: Food order from Flower Child for “T G” to be dropped off the customer’s house a few miles away.

After delaying Order 1 like crazy and finally picking it up, the app told me to go to Flower Child and pick up an order for T G and drop off Selena G’s order, but me being stupid I thought they were probably the same person because they had the same last initial, so I left both of their orders there and told the cashier that, I messaged T G saying I left theirs and Selena G’s order at Flower Child, to which T G said “What does that mean” and I sat in my car for a minute before realizing oH tHeY’rE nOt tHe sAmE PerSon. I said “Sorry pls disregard,” they were like “Sure, uh so when tf are you gonna have my order.”

T G’s order was to be dropped off at their house. I messaged Selena G to ask if they were inside, they said yes. Okay so I just don’t know how to read simple instructions. The scolding I got from the cashier saying “I tried to tell you but you were far gone” (I was overstimulated and not very perceptive to what she was saying and just couldn’t with doing things and being in public at that point) when I went back inside to take T G’s order was humbling.

I don’t even know if I made any sense but TL;DR I fumbled an order and made two people wait the better part of an hour for what should’ve taken like 10-15 minutes total and proved my low IQ to two cashiers.

1mykhx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1mykhx6/wibta_if_i_told_my_longtime_best_friend_that_i/,WIBTA if I told my longtime best friend that I don’t want to be friends with her during her vacation?,"I (23F) have been friends with my childhood best friend let’s call her Summer (22F) since middle school. Our friendship was stable until after high school when I moved to another city for college while she stayed local. At first things were fine but by freshman year she started voicing complaints mainly that I didn’t FaceTime her enough. I apologized but explained that my attention was split between roommates, classes, homework and a new city. She somewhat understood but because she didn’t have many friends she seemed to expect me to still make extra time for her. At the time I felt guilty but looking back it feels like she was entitled to my time.

Throughout college this became a recurring issue. I didn’t always have the time she wanted and while she accepted the little I could give she kept high expectations. Meanwhile I also changed. I used to be sensitive, non-confrontational and careful with my words. Over time I became more direct, straightforward and comfortable expressing myself honestly.

Summer however sees this as me being too blunt and intense. My wit and sass which I intend as playful come across to her as harsh. Instead of seeing my assertiveness as confidence she views it as “too much” or “lacking softness” especially since she’s become more sensitive these past few years. I like to think this stems from freshman year when a mutual friend of ours cut ties with her which she still hasn’t gotten over even FOUR years later. She’s also made very few friends in college which has made her rely heavily on me.

By senior year our friendship felt strained. We only hung out three times that year and honestly I didn’t enjoy them the way I used to. I felt like I had to filter myself to protect her feelings which meant I couldn’t truly be myself. Our conversations often revolved around her problems making me feel more like a therapist than a friend. Sometimes I would vent too but it honestly felt like therapy sessions.

One big conflict was around her graduation and birthday. She invited me to her grad party but it was the weekend before finals and I couldn’t bc IT WAS THE WEEKEND BEFORE FINALS. She said she understood over text  but later brought it up again saying I should have “stayed for a bit” and then driven back. That threw me off bc over text she said it was ok but in rl she was still upset?? It was completely unreasonable because that would mean I drive two hours stayed for a bit then drive two hours back and then studied after all that driving. She also invited me to her birthday party but I declined because of the mixed signals between us (and admittedly I RSVP’d to another party before realizing it was her birthday. I apologized for this but I still wouldn’t have gone. —-> I told her this when we got coffee).

Months later we met for coffee and I gave her a gift to show I still cared and was sorry for forgetting her birthday. We discussed expectations and I told her I couldn’t give her as much time as she wanted because of work and school. She wasn’t happy but said she’d “take what she could get.” Which in that moment was happy with but later I realized that I won’t truly meet her expectations. She also asked me to start sending her texts like “I missed you” or “I love you.” I told her I don’t really do that anymore. She said her new friends do that. Honestly it felt like she was trying to force our friendship into something it used to be. And honestly I still say “miss ya” and “love ya” to other friends but not to her which shows me I’m just not into this friendship the way I used to be.

More recently when I asked to hang out she didn’t respond for days. Then once I replied to a comment she left on my post she suddenly replied immediately only to say she couldn’t because she was leaving for vacation the day I asked to hang. I swore she told me she was leaving a few days later. I couldn’t help but feel defensive but honestly that’s because I know she took it personally. My other friends wouldn’t have and would understand I genuinely thought it was a separate date.

At this point I’ve been reflecting and realized I don’t want to continue the friendship. Summer is still kind and sweet but she’s far too sensitive and holds me to expectations I can’t meet. Our personalities have grown in different directions and I feel drained by the relationship. With my Master’s program starting soon I don’t want to carry this stress with me. The problem is I don’t know how to cut her off without her spiraling but I feel like I need to end it before school begins.

1mykeov,https://i.redd.it/9eacnrtjsvkf1.jpeg,Moved to Melbourne for research at RMIT – feeling a bit alone and hoping to meet people,"
Hey everyone, I recently moved to Melbourne from Asia to start a research position at RMIT. It’s a big step in my career, and while I’m really grateful for the opportunity, I didn’t quite expect how hard the loneliness would hit.

Most of my days are just work and going back to a quiet place. I don’t really know anyone here yet, and it’s been tough not having familiar faces or people to talk to. I miss simple things like grabbing a coffee with a friend or having someone to explore the city with on weekends.

If you’re around RMIT or Melbourne and open to making a new connection – whether it’s for a coffee, a walk, or just chatting about life – I’d really appreciate it. I’m friendly, a bit quiet at first, but always happy to listen and learn from others.

Thanks for reading this. It took me a bit to post, but I figured it’s okay to reach out sometimes.

1myk98i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1myk98i/how_to_win_a_girl_back_advice/,How to win a girl back? (advice?),"I do not understand women. My ex 30F broke things off 6 times since 2020. We met online, hit it off immediately, but she keeps saying I am not ready to be with her since then. (first time she said I needed more jesus in my life)...it's been a rollercoaster. The longest we were together was maybe 6 weeks in 2021 before it fell apart because I was not in a position to pay her bills (I think? I forget, it was always some reason that made no sense to me)...I never dated anyone or even tried since 2020. She would cut off all contact, sometimes say mean hateful things to each other, then when I reached out, for a while she would reply LEAVE ME ALONE, but then always would soften and reply ""why dont you call me?"" One time in 2022 she called ME saying she was sorry for how she treated me the last time. She has anxiety, adhd, likely some depression, doesn't handle stress well etc. HOWEVER, anytime we were broken up, she would always say she loved me still, never stopped loving me or thinking of me, tried to go on a few dates with a few guys but they could not compare to me and she loved ME not them. Confusing, I know.

I finally reached out to her where i noticed she would block and unblock me on linkedin Aug 2024- I reach out, we joke, we talk, she says I should call her, I do...she said she would unblock me to see if I was less crazy (joking sorta? she was nice about things)...we called each other, she said she would give me a year to work on myself, work on my anxiety, better job, some personal mental health issues, she would unblock me exactly 1 year from them...she blocks me for 2 days, calls and leaves a message saying she's weird, she's only had 1 other relationship outside of me, doesn't always know how to express her feelings but is trying to work on that, just call me she says. I do and we finally date a full year.

Very stressful year for both of us- her power goes out for 6 weeks, she stays at my apt, she is way behind on all her bills, no full time job for 3 yrs, works part time for her sister for 3 months but that ends, she finds out she has ADHD, loses her insurance so cant get the meds, has anxiety, finally starts at the start of Aug 2025 to take lexapro she was given in Feb, but she doesnt like to take meds but she was SO stressed she said she had to take them. Basically TONS of stress for both of us, so it has not been always conducive to romance and hanging out, having fun, etc. She breaks things off Aug 6, I said mean things I immediately took back. She said she was done, but she always says that. It just ended suddenly and explosively.

But I want her back. I must win her back. I told her I would take care of her all the rest of my life, and I want that still. I tried to reach out, told her I missed her loved her, etc. Reached out to her only friend in Dallas this girl I met several times and we went to church and to this goat coffee place together. No reply from my ex or her friend. I reached out a few times via email to offer to pay her mortgage bc I don't want her to lose her house....would she accept the money? No reply. Her mom texted me (she's not close with her mom) and said she was scared of me when I let my emotions get out of control (I showed up to her house 3 times crying begging her to talk to me). my ex said I made her feel unsafe in her own home (she wouldn't talk to me barely through anything but linkedin messages and it hurt me)

Point being, I am not blameless. I want to show her I am safe to be with, I will respect her, I am not perfect but I am trying, I will not show up to her house like I did and I am sorry for that. But, how do I go about winning her back, so I can reach out in 3months and say hi, can I call you, I miss and love you?

I just need to fix this. She's the love of my life, and as crazy as I might sound, I don't wanna forget her or move on. We both said what we had was so amazing nothing else compares...we can make it work. I can fix it. I know I can. How do I do it? Any advice would be great because it's all I want and I feel broken without her beautiful face in my life every day. She has come back 6 times, so how do I not see this as real love? Why come back 6 times over 5 years?

this is my youtube where I have made videos working through my emotions. I feel it's helped me a little, but is this a total turn off to a girl? Will it hurt my chances of getting her back if I give her space/time to miss me, love me, and reach out and pray she softens again and wants to try again? Should I delete these all immediately in case she hasn't seen them or has? (please be nice, I am very fragile and feel broken inside and just love a woman with all my heart)...

This evening before I transfered my half of the groceries to her I realized we didn’t have any beer left (we both like our beer). Since I had bought the last case I thought I would go out and buy more and just deduct it from what I owed her for the groceries. We take turns buying cases of beer. She didn’t like that and insisted I was being “cheap”. She said she’d already spent enough money today on groceries and gas and I should buy the beer. The gas tank could have lasted us until monday morning when she could have gassed up on the way to work.  It turned into a big fight and it’s not even about the money to me, its about the principle.

3. Offer them our service: a professional website or app as a must-have for their business.



🔹 My role:

I handle the builds (usually completed within a few days depending on scope).


🔹 The deal:

We split 50/50 on every project.

Average project: $600–$2,000+

That’s ~$300+ each per “yes.”


Example: 10 “yes” calls in a day could equal ~$3,000 for both of us.

If this sounds like your kind of hustle, DM me and let’s start building income together 🙏

I've heard of a few people doing this as teams with steady income of $10k a month... Why not try? 34 yes in a month... That's less than 2 per day",1,1756002785.0,u_Deep-Mycologist1068,0,1.0,False

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

If this resonates with you, send me a message.",2,1756002548.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.75,False

1myk0rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nocontactfamily/comments/1myk0rb/is_it_possible_to_still_have_a_relationship_with/,Is it possible to still have a relationship with your family besides 1 parent,"Backstory: for years, my mom has guilt tripped me, been very unsupportive, cared only how social media sees her/the family, and has not shown remorse, change or empathy when Ive communicated that she has done or said something that has hurt me. Last year, my step-father (who I did not grow close to until I was 17yo, prior had a negative relationship) had an incident that led to being paralyzed from the hips down. This was about 1.5 months before my wedding that was 8 hours away. During wedding planning, my mom would get upset with me that I would say no to her ideas or that I would want to make decisions with my partner instead of her about things like decorations, invites, guestlist, etc.  She was not supportive to me when I chose to have a small wedding and basically told me that if I chose to elope and the she would show up anyway. She never once asked me how I was doing leading up to the wedding regarding my stepfather not being able to attend my wedding, due to rehab and insurance stuff. 
Wedding weekend - one of the only things I ask for her to do is to bring food/coffee for me and my 3 bridesmaids the morning of. I asked her months in advance and I told her that if she couldn't, just to tell me and id make other arrangements (she is not known for being accountable or timely). I invite her to get ready for us, even though it makes me slightly uncomfortable.  She does not come with food and she does not stay. She stands awkwardly with my brother in tow and leaves, saying that my grandparents were bringing food (at this point, im getting nauseous because ive been up for 3 hours with no food and needing caffeine). She makes choices that day to reserve her spot with a gaudy ribbon in the front row (there was 30 people at my wedding, no one was taking 'her' spot 🙄), she goes into the bridal party suite and refuses to go sit with the rest if the guest just before the ceremony, and she put the tripod with her phone on it that was meant so that my stepfather could watch the ceremony BEHIND THE ALTAR, instead of holding it with her like we talked about the day prior. 
The next day, I message her that a few of her choices above really bothered us and that it made us feel like she didn't respect us enough to stick with the plans we had made for our day. She tries to say things like, 'this is really what your worried about?'. We have a phone call and she goes OFF on me, saying negative things about my friends, how im a bad person for having her take a family photo with me, my partner, her and my father (who she was never married too and had not been with in 26 years), acting offended that I had a father-daughter dance with my dad when my stepfather couldn't attend, how my dog was such a bad dog and stressed her out, screaming, cussing, etc. I try to take the high road, I keep using I statements. It ends with her telling me that we should just cut ties, done. 
This was May, in June she tells me to get on my own phone plan and car insurance (the only two things they've been taking care of since I was 18, ive been responsible for all of my other adulting things). I dont take the bait, I take care of those things, change all my addresses for insurance, retirement, etc to my current home (had previously just used my parents so I didn't have to worry about it when leases ended, you know!). In September I tell my grandparents im pregnant and my mom ends up calling me, I dont answer. She asks to meet for coffee, I do. She does not take any accountability for the nasty way she treated me the day after the wedding and is very offended when I say I dont feel safe with her (shes fixated on how shes never physically hurt me). We end on neutral terms, even after she doesnt bring up my pregnancy and tells me that im the reason she's divorcing my now handicapped in a wheelchair step-dad (as he continued to talk to me and we saw each other frequently this entire time while he was in rehab). I just say I dont want to have contact outside of family events. 
We dont do the holidays together, my grandfather is sick, she comes to my graduation for my master's degree (we dont talk), she doesnt get me a present for christmas, we only exchange maybe 5 messages this whole time on holidays and her birthday. She meets with me 2 months before I have my baby, saying she has thought more about our conversations. i allow her to see us a bit more and meet my daughter. She ONLY messages and talks to me about my daughter and is upset im not having visitors in the hospital. She doesnt ask about me in post partum, she doesnt try to take care of me. One day, I tell her that it hurts my feelings that she only ever asks about Ivy but never me or my partner. She basically tells me that I should get over it because my daughter is new and that no one cared to ask about her when my step-dad had his incident that left him paralyzed. I cancel mother's day plans and she continues to not contact me for 6 weeks after this. Now its been over 3 months since that and I honestly dont want contact. I dont want my daughter around this type of behavior and I dont think that its okay for her to see her own mother being treated this way. 
There's so much more, the talking trash to my aunt constantly, the whole family continuing to do things but not even try to involve me, my daughter or my partner, my mom getting mad and my stepdad having to sneak around to see me and my family. 
Now, my aunt has said nasty things to me and has not allowed me to interact with my cousins (teenagers) that I was previously close too or introduce them to my daughter out of fear of hurting my moms feelings. Im starting to see more and more that my family does not care about how my mother has hurt me and how they hurt my feelings, they only care about ensuring my mom is okay and thay they are not on the bad end of her mad side. My grandparents think that I should just be fine so that my mom can know her granddaughter. They barely check in with me and never make plans, recently admitting that they cannot see me and my daughter because of my mom.

Is it possible to have a relationship with my grandparents without having to allow my mom in our life? Ive already lost the relationship I thought i had with a supportive aunt, who ended up being just as bad as my mom towards me, ive lost my cousins. Do I just need to accept i wont have grandparents now too? My grandmother cannot fathom that daughter's would be negative towards me, but I believe thats because she would never be disrespectful to them as their mother. My grandparents will likely never understand the concept of cutting off a family member, but I just wish they would realize they can have a relationship with both of separately... 

How am I supposed to navigate holidays, my brothers life events, or being able to see my step-dad? How am I supposed to be okay with the fact that if I dont just allow my mom to have contact with my daughter, that I will likely lose the ability to be there when my grandparents pass away, to have important items from their home and my childhood home?

INT. SAM’S APARTMENT – MORNING

(The place is a mess — takeout boxes, a tipped-over pillow fort, random toys from Samuel scattered everywhere. Carly is pulling on her jacket, clearly about to leave after a sleepover.)

CARLY: (smiling, grabbing her bag) Okay… that was fun. Thanks for letting me crash here.

SAM: (grinning) Anytime, cupcake. Just remember next time — you kick in your sleep like a damn mule.

(Audience laughs — Carly makes a face.)

CARLY: (rolling her eyes) Well, maybe if you didn’t snore like a chainsaw—

SAM: (smirks) Hey, that’s a family trait. Samuel’s probably gonna inherit it too.

(Right on cue, Samuel, Sam’s 3-year-old, waddles out of his room in dinosaur pajamas, rubbing his eyes. Carly’s expression softens immediately.)

CARLY: (gushing) Oh my gosh… is this him?

SAM: (casual) Yep. Meet Samuel. Don’t get too excited, he’s basically me, but smaller and stickier.

(Samuel toddles over and clings to Sam’s leg. Sam ruffles his hair, but he’s clearly more interested in tugging on Carly’s jacket string.)

CARLY: (kneeling down, smiling) Hi, Samuel. I’m Carly.

(Samuel doesn’t say anything, just tugs the string and giggles. Carly laughs.)

SAM: (shrugs) Yeah, that’s about as social as he gets before waffles.

CARLY: (smiling at Sam) He’s adorable.

SAM: (mock-serious) Don’t let the cute fool you. He’s a tiny criminal mastermind. Yesterday, he tried to flush my keys down the toilet.

(Audience chuckles. Carly gently pats Samuel’s hair before standing.)

CARLY: Well… I better get going before I get sucked into the chaos vortex.

SAM: (grinning) Too late — once you meet Samuel, you’re stuck for life.

(Carly rolls her eyes but smiles warmly at them both. She heads for the door.)

CARLY: (calling back) See you later, Sam. And… maybe bring him by the studio sometime.

SAM: (teasing) Yeah, yeah. If he behaves. Which… he won’t. Little badass already runs the place.

(Audience laughs. Carly waves goodbye and exits. Sam looks down at Samuel, who’s now playing with her shoelaces.)

SAM: (sighs, but smirks) You’re already ruining my reputation, kid.

Cut to intro

INT. RESTAURANT – DAY

(Sam sits in a booth, sipping coffee. Samuel is beside her in a booster seat, dunking fries in ketchup like it’s his life mission. The door opens — in walks Jade West, now stylish, confident, sunglasses, and clearly recognizable as a famous actress. A couple of fans whisper and sneak photos. Sam nearly chokes on her coffee.)

SAM: (pointing) No freaking way. That’s Jade West. The girl’s a damn movie star now!

(Audience laughs. Jade notices her and smirks before walking over.)

JADE: (teasing) Still alive, Puckett? Thought you’d have exploded from cholesterol years ago.

(Audience laughs. Sam stands, stunned but grinning.)

SAM: I can’t believe you even remember me. We barely hung out, what, a few weeks?

JADE: (shrugs) Please. Hard to forget the only girl I met who could body slam a biker and eat three turkey legs right after.

(Audience laughs. Sam smirks, shakes her head, and gestures for Jade to sit. Samuel eyes Jade suspiciously while gnawing on a fry.)

SAM: (gesturing) That’s my kid. Samuel.

JADE: (raising an eyebrow) You have a kid? …Damn. Didn’t see that coming.

SAM: (deadpan) Yeah, well, the father bailed. So it’s just me, him, and a microwave that’s seen too much.

(Audience laughs. Jade glances at Samuel, then back at Sam, softening slightly.)

JADE: He’s cute. Definitely looks like trouble — must run in the family.

SAM: (grinning) Damn right.

(They share a moment before Jade leans back, arms crossed.)

JADE: So… word is you’re back on iCarly?

SAM: (surprised) You’ve been keeping tabs?

JADE: (smirking) Please. You and Carly trending online again? Hard to miss.

SAM: (half-smirk) Yeah… started filming with Freddie and Carly again. Same old chaos.

JADE: (leaning in) Perfect. That means you should bring the whole crew to my movie premiere.

SAM: (blinking) Wait… you mean like a real movie premiere?

JADE: (mock-offended) Excuse you. I’m the lead in Wolves. Critics are already drooling.

SAM: (whistles) Wolves, huh? Fancy.

JADE: (grinning) Bring Carly, Freddie, hell, bring the sculpture freak too.Ah, got it — Sam needs to have her classic annoying/teasing nickname for Harper in there, even if Harper isn’t in the scene yet. Let’s tweak Scene 2 to include that. Here’s the updated version:


---

INT. FREDDIE’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – DAY

(Freddie is pacing, hands on his hips. Millicent, now 14, sits on the couch with her phone glued to her hand.)

FREDDIE: (frustrated) I don’t care if he’s “different.” Any guy who calls me “bruh” when I meet him is not dating my daughter.

MILLICENT: (eye roll) Dad, he’s literally the nicest guy. You act like he’s a serial killer.

FREDDIE: (serious) He showed up to meet me… wearing socks with sandals. That’s basically a damn felony.

(Audience laughs. Millicent groans, grabs her backpack, and heads for the door. She opens it — and there’s Sam, leaning against the frame with her trademark smirk.)

MILLICENT: (scoffs) Great. Another fossil from the past.

(Audience “oohs.” Sam raises an eyebrow but doesn’t bite. She just shrugs as Millicent storms out.)

SAM: (to Freddie) Your kid’s got fire. Respect.

FREDDIE: (sighs) Yeah. Fire aimed directly at me.

(Sam strolls in, tosses her jacket over the back of a chair, and flops onto the couch.)

SAM: So, guess who I ran into? Jade West. Yeah, that Jade West. The famous actress.

FREDDIE: (nodding, impressed) I know. Big deal. Star of Wolves, right?

SAM: (grinning) Yep. And she invited the whole iCarly gang to the premiere. Said I could bring as many people as I want.

FREDDIE: (raising an eyebrow) All of us?

SAM: Yep. Carly, you, Spencer, and that one—Harper… or as I like to call her, “Snooty Pants McMirrorFace.”

(Audience laughs. Freddie chuckles.)

FREDDIE: (nods, smiling) Perfect. Carly’s out right now, but we’ll tell the rest later.

SAM: (snickers) Good. Maybe she can help you pick out something that doesn’t make you look like a middle-aged mall cop.

FREDDIE: (smirking) Please. I have just the suit.

(Freddie disappears into his bedroom. Beat. He comes back out in a shiny, way-too-tight suit, posing proudly.)

FREDDIE: Boom. Perfect.

SAM: (staring) …Perfect if you’re auditioning for “Creepy Magician: The Movie.”

(Audience laughs. Freddie scoffs.)

FREDDIE: This is sleek. Sophisticated.

SAM: (grinning) Freddie, that suit screams “recently divorced and desperately swiping right.”

(Audience bursts into laughter. Freddie adjusts his tie defensively.)

SAM: (final jab) Honestly? You look like you got lost on your way to seat people at Olive Garden.

(Audience howls. Freddie groans, muttering as he heads back toward his room.)

FREDDIE: (under his breath) Haters. All of you.

(Cue laugh track, cut to black.)






INT. FREDDIE’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – DAY

(The door opens. Carly, Spencer, and Harper walk in. Sam lounges on the couch; Freddie sits casually in an armchair, scrolling on his phone.)

CARLY: So… what’s going on?

SAM: Jade invited us—

FREDDIE: —to her movie premiere.

SAM: Red carpet, fancy outfits—

FREDDIE: —paparazzi everywhere, the whole gang.

(They pause, watching each other with the usual smirk. Sam suddenly shoves Freddie to the ground.)

SAM: (mocking) Yep. Just like old times. Little doofus always thinks he’s slick.

(Audience laughs. Freddie groans.)

SPENCER: So… we should probably get something to wear, right?

CARLY: Yeah, shopping!

HARPER: Sure.

SAM: Whatever.

FREDDIE: Nope. I’m good. My suit is perfect.

SAM: (mocking) Perfect? You look like a shiny middle-aged mall cop who found glitter.

FREDDIE: (defensive) It’s sleek! Sophisticated!

SAM: (grinning) Sleek? Nah. It screams, “please make fun of me!”

(Audience laughs. Freddie huffs, storms into his bedroom. A moment later he comes back out in the same shiny, over-the-top suit, trying to act confident.)

CARLY: (laughing) Oh wow… Freddie, you did it again.

SPENCER: (mock serious) Truly a masterpiece… of tragedy.

HARPER: (deadpan) Yep. That’s a no from me.

SAM: (grinning, pointing) Look at him! Human disco ball!

(Audience howls. Freddie groans, rubbing his forehead.)

FREDDIE: (grumbling) Haters. All of you.

SAM: (laughing) Nah, just honest critics, buddy.

(Cue laugh track, cut to black.)

Ah! Got it — Freddie isn’t part of this montage; it’s just Sam, Carly, Spencer, and Harper. Let’s fix Scene 4 properly.


---

INT. VARIOUS SHOPS – DAY

(Montage begins. Sam, Carly, Spencer, and Harper try on outfits for Jade West’s premiere. Upbeat music plays. Harper critiques everyone mercilessly.)

HARPER: (arms crossed) Nope. That color makes your skin look… like beige soup.

SPENCER: (twirling in a sparkly vest) But… it’s wearable art!

HARPER: (deadpan) Wearable trash, maybe.

(Audience laughs. Cut to Sam trying on a dress with too many zippers.)

SAM: How’s this?

HARPER: (snorting) Girl… are you trying to fight a motorcycle gang or attend a red carpet?

SAM: (grinning) Both?

(Audience laughs. Carly twirls in a sleek gown.)

CARLY: Okay, how about this one?

HARPER: Finally, something that doesn’t scream “I lost a bet.”

(Spencer enters in a ridiculous sculpture-inspired outfit.)

SPENCER: Behold! The pinnacle of wearable creativity!

HARPER: (arms crossed, unimpressed) And behold… the pinnacle of everyone else laughing at you.

(Quick cuts of everyone trying on hats, shoes, and ridiculous accessories. Harper critiques them all relentlessly.)

SAM: What about this jacket? Classic Sam chaos chic.

HARPER: (rolling eyes) It’s… chaotic. I’ll give you that.

(Montage ends with all four of them standing in front of mirrors, satisfied with their outfits. Laughter and playful banter continue.)

(Cue laugh track, cut to black.)





(Flashbulbs pop, reporters chatter, fans scream. The iCarly gang walks up the carpet together: Sam, Carly, Freddie, Spencer, and Harper. Sam is already laughing at Freddie’s stiff posture in his suit.)

SAM: (snickering) You look like a tax accountant at prom.

FREDDIE: It’s a classic suit! Timeless!

SAM: (mock gasp) Timelessly ugly.

(Audience laughs. Jade steps away from the press line and greets them, looking cool and glamorous in her premiere outfit.)

JADE: Well, well… the famous iCarly crew. (eyes Spencer and Harper) …and… two extras?

SPENCER: (offended) Extra?! I’m the artistic visionary!

HARPER: (smirking) And I’m the one making sure these clowns don’t embarrass Jade’s premiere.

JADE: (raising an eyebrow) Uh-huh. Whatever you say.

(She turns to Freddie, tilting her head at his suit.)

JADE: …Seriously? That’s what you’re wearing?

(Audience laughs. Freddie straightens his tie defensively. Sam bursts out laughing.)

SAM: See?! Even Hollywood royalty thinks you look like a rejected mall mannequin.

FREDDIE: (rolling eyes) Oh please. It’s a clean, tailored—

JADE: (cutting him off, smirking) Yeah, sure. Anyway— (to Carly) great seeing you guys, but I gotta schmooze with producers before they explode. Don’t cause a scene on my carpet.

(She waves casually and disappears into the crowd of press and producers. The group watches her go. Freddie still looks flustered.)

(Then, across the carpet, Freddie spots a pretty girl laughing with friends. His jaw drops a little.)

SAM: (noticing) Ohhh no. Don’t even tell me.

FREDDIE: (smiling nervously) She’s… she’s gorgeous.

SAM: (groaning) You’ve known her for three seconds and you’re already planning your wedding. Classic Benson.

FREDDIE: I am not! I’m just saying—

SAM: (interrupting) —You’re just saying you’re about to embarrass yourself harder than that suit already did.

FREDDIE: (snapping back) For your information, girls like suits.

SAM: Yeah, girls like good suits. Yours looks like you borrowed it from a middle-school choir concert.

(Audience laughs.)

FREDDIE: (defensive) You’re one to talk. Half your closet smells like beef jerky!

SAM: (grinning) And yet, somehow, I still pull more attention than you do.

FREDDIE: That’s because people are afraid you’ll punch them if they don’t!

SAM: (mock offended) Please. I only punch people who deserve it. (leans closer, smirking) …and you’re at the top of the damn list.

(Audience cheers/laughs. Carly sighs, trying to step in.)

CARLY: Guys, please. It’s a premiere, not a wrestling ring.

SPENCER: (to Harper) You think security’s gonna throw them out?

HARPER: (deadpan) Only if Freddie’s suit doesn’t do it first.

(Audience laughs. Sam and Freddie glare at each other, then both sneak another look at the pretty girl across the carpet. Sam shakes her head, smirking as Freddie nervously adjusts his tie again.)

(Cut to black.)

SCENE 5 (CONTINUED) — EXT. MOVIE PREMIERE — NIGHT

(Freddie adjusts his jacket nervously, then finally approaches the pretty girl standing near the entrance. Sam, arms crossed, watches with a sarcastic grin.)

SAM: (under her breath) There he goes. Straight into heartbreak city. Population: Benson.

(But instead of brushing him off, the girl lights up when she sees him.)

GIRL: Wait—no way. You’re Freddie Benson from iCarly, right?

FREDDIE: (smiling, flustered) Guilty. I was the nerd behind the camera… and occasionally in front of it.

(They laugh. Sam frowns slightly as she notices they’re vibing.)

CARLY: (walking up with Harper) We’re grabbing drinks before the movie starts. You two want anything?

SAM: I’m good.

SPENCER: Surprise me. If it glows in the dark, even better.

HARPER: (rolling her eyes) One toxic soda coming right up.

(Carly and Harper leave. It’s just Sam and Spencer now. Sam’s gaze lingers on Freddie and the girl, who are still talking.)

SPENCER: (nudging her) …Okay. What’s with the look?

SAM: What look?

SPENCER: (points) That one. The “someone stole my last corn dog” look.

SAM: (rolls eyes) I don’t know what you’re talking about.

SPENCER: (grinning) Oh, I know it. That’s jealousy. Sam Puckett. Jealous over Freddie. Never thought I’d see the day.

SAM: (groans) Ugh, fine. Maybe. Like… a tiny, microscopic maybe. Smaller than a fruit fly. Happy?

SPENCER: (teasing) So, Freddie Benson, your first kiss, still sneaks under your skin.

SAM: (quietly, more serious) Yeah. Maybe that’s part of it. We dated back in high school, and it crashed harder than your sculptures. But sometimes I wonder if we should’ve tried again.

(She looks over — Freddie and the girl laugh, leaning closer. Sam swallows, softer now.)

SAM: …Not that it matters. Look at him. He’s happy. And me? I’d ruin it. He’s already been through two divorces and more breakups than I can count. He doesn’t need another disaster.

SPENCER: (gently) You don’t know that.

SAM: (sighs) Plus, I’ve got Samuel now. It’s not just about me anymore. My kid’s my whole world, Spence. I can’t gamble with his life by dragging him into something messy. If Freddie and I blew up again, it wouldn’t just hurt me this time.

SPENCER: (softening) …That makes sense.

SAM: (shrugs, trying to mask emotion) And besides… (beat) …I still think Freddie’s got a thing for Carly. That torch doesn’t just burn out. I can’t compete with my best friend.

(Spencer studies her, then rests a hand gently on her shoulder.)

SPENCER: Maybe you’re right. Maybe you’re not. But either way… you’re a better friend than you think.

(Sam looks down, then quickly covers her vulnerability with a smirk.)

SAM: (punching his arm lightly) Tell anyone I got all mushy, and I’ll deep-fry your underwear.

SPENCER: (grinning) Joke’s on you — I don’t wear underwear.

(Audience laughter. Sam groans and shoves him.)

SAM: Gross, Spence. Just gross.

(They both look back at Freddie and the girl. She laughs again, touching his arm. Sam forces a grin, but her eyes show a mix of jealousy, regret, and protective fear — the weight of being a mom holding her back from risking her heart again.)

(Audience “awww.” Camera lingers on Sam’s conflicted expression before fading to black)


Got it — this is a powerful emotional close to the act, really cementing Sam’s inner conflict and her love for Samuel. Here’s Scene 6 fully written out in screenplay style:






(The lights dim as everyone takes their seats. The group files in: Carly, Spencer, Harper, Freddie… and the girl sitting right beside him. Sam trails behind, scowling when she realizes the only empty seat left is directly next to them. She plops down with an exaggerated sigh.)

SAM: (muttering) Perfect. Just perfect.

(The movie starts. On screen, wolves howl dramatically, but Sam isn’t watching. She sneaks glances at Freddie and the girl. Freddie whispers something, the girl giggles, and slowly their hands meet. Sam stiffens, her eyes narrowing. The sound of their laughter cuts sharper than the film’s score.)

(Sam lasts a moment longer before suddenly standing up, almost knocking her popcorn.)

CARLY: (concerned, whispering) Sam? Where are you going?

SAM: (tight, avoiding eye contact) I… I just gotta go.

(Carly starts to rise, but Spencer gently puts a hand on her shoulder, shaking his head.)

SPENCER: Let her go.

(Carly hesitates, then sits back down. As Sam walks past, Carly leans and softly whispers after her.)

CARLY: (whispering) Call me, okay?

(Sam nods faintly but doesn’t stop. Freddie, confused, leans over Carly.)

FREDDIE: What happened?

CARLY: (forcing a small smile) She’s not feeling well. Don’t worry about it.

(Freddie frowns, glancing back toward the exit, but then the girl squeezes his hand and he turns back reluctantly. Sam pushes through the theater doors, her silhouette vanishing into the light of the lobby.)


---

SCENE 6 (CONTINUED) — SAM’S APARTMENT — NIGHT

(Sam quietly unlocks the door, the sound of the movie still echoing in her head. She sets her keys down, takes a deep breath, and walks into Samuel’s room. The boy is sound asleep, tucked in just like she left him. The tension in her shoulders melts.)

(She kneels beside the bed, brushing a strand of hair from his forehead. She kisses his head gently, her voice low, full of unshakable love.)

SAM: (softly) I love you, kiddo. More than anything.

(Samuel stirs slightly but doesn’t wake. Sam smiles sadly, lingering for a moment before standing. She takes one last look at him, silhouetted by the glow of a nightlight, then slowly closes the door behind her.)

(Cue soft outro music — bittersweet but tender, fading as the screen cuts to black.)

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KBO Showdown: Samsung Lions vs. Kiwoom Heroes – The Ultimate Same-Game Parlay Play**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a clash of KBO titans: the Samsung Lions (1.11 implied probability of victory) vs. the Kiwoom Heroes (5.43 odds, or roughly 15% chance to pull off a miracle). This isn’t just a game—it’s a math problem, a crowd-pulling circus, and a lesson in why you shouldn’t bet on underdogs while eating a hot dog. Let’s dissect this with the precision of a catcher’s glove and the humor of a pitcher’s breaking ball.

---

### 1. Parsing the Odds: Why Samsung is the Statistical King of the Hill

The numbers scream “Samsung party.” At -150 to -110 implied probabilities across bookmakers, the Lions are the financial equivalent of a free espresso at a coffee shop—unavoidable and slightly guilt-inducing if you don’t take them. Kiwoom, meanwhile, is priced like a last-minute Black Friday deal: *“Why would anyone bet on a 5.43 underdog? You’re literally paying 5x to lose!”*

The spreads back this up. Samsung is favored by 1.5 to 4.5 runs, depending on the bookmaker. At -2.5 (-143 odds), they’re essentially being handed a 2.5-run head start. For Kiwoom to cover +2.5, they’d need to either (a) hit a walk-off home run or (b) invent time travel and rewind the game’s final pitch.

Totals are set at 10.5 runs, with the Over and Under nearly tied (1.95 vs. 1.8). This suggests bookmakers expect a middle-of-the-road affair—neither a laugher nor a pitchers’ duel. But given Samsung’s recent dominance (they’ve sold out Daegu’s 24,000-seat stadium this season), let’s assume they’ll score enough to make the Over tempting.

---

### 2. News Digest: Crowds, Circuses, and a Lack of Shoelace Awareness

The KBO’s 10-million-attendance milestone is no accident. Samsung’s Daegu fortress is as packed as a subway during rush hour, while Kiwoom’s Heroes have fans in Gwangju who showed up in numbers so low, even the concession stands sold out of nachos.

But here’s the kicker: **Samsung’s recent games are so popular, fans are reportedly sitting in the aisles “for ambiance.”** Meanwhile, Kiwoom’s offense has the consistency of a toddler’s nap schedule—unpredictable, but not in a cute way.

No major injury reports here, but let’s

1myjy9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1myjy9g/how_small_daily_habits_can_boost_your_focus_and/,How Small Daily Habits Can Boost Your Focus and Keep Your Brain Sharp,"One big mistake a lot of people make is waiting for a “huge life change” or some major event to feel different.
But neuroscientists say the opposite: your brain doesn’t thrive on massive leaps, it thrives on small, consistent steps.

For example:

10 minutes of walking every single day → way better than one hour once a week.

Cutting back on sugar in your coffee → a tiny change that protects your memory long-term.

Learning something new (a word in another language, or a simple recipe) → this keeps your brain regions active and slows decline with age.

Going to bed and waking up at the same time → both your body and brain love consistent routines.

The best part? These “micro-habits” don’t require huge effort, but over time they build up like a mental investment that compounds daily.
Scientists call it: “neuroplasticity in action” — meaning your brain literally reshapes and adapts based on your small, daily choices.
📌 Bottom line:
You don’t need to flip your life upside down overnight. Just start with small, simple changes, and you’ll see your brain evolve and work better over time.

## **AFTERWORDS**

## **Episode 3 – “Tom Selleck Hosts Marx”**

### **INT. AFTERWORDS SET – TIMELESS GREEN ROOM**

The velvet curtains sway. The desk lamp hums. Instead of the usual Host, **TOM SELLECK** strolls out, Hawaiian shirt tucked into jeans, mug in hand. The mug reads: *PROPERTY OF MAGNUM P.I.*

He sits at the desk, looking around. The audience is… ghostly. Literally transparent. They clap anyway.

**SELLECK (smiling nervously):**  
Uh… hi. Good evening, or morning, or… you know, whenever eternity happens. I’m Tom Selleck. Yes, *that* Tom Selleck.

(Beat. He squints upward, stage lights hot on him.)  
Normally I’m a detective, a police commissioner, or occasionally myself in a reverse mortgage ad. Tonight, apparently, I’m dead. Or dreaming. Or filling in for someone who really needs a vacation.

He sets the mug down, leans into the camera with practiced gravitas.

**SELLECK (earnest):**  
They told me the regular host is off… negotiating syndication rights with God? Am I hearing that right? Sounds serious. So here I am. I’ve hosted before—daytime, primetime—but never the afterlife. I didn’t even bring index cards.

(He flips a cue card. It just says: “YOU’RE DEAD, DEAL WITH IT.”)
Right. Helpful.

(Looks back to audience.)  
Anyway, tonight’s guest is… Karl Marx.

Polite ghost applause. A few boos. One ghostly intern yells “THE BEARD RULES.”

**SELLECK:**  
You may know him as the philosopher of communism, or as the face on that Che Guevara T-shirt knockoff your college roommate bought for ten bucks. Or, if you’re my uncle Frank… the guy who personally ruined his 401k.

(Lowers voice, conspiratorial.)  
He’s also a meme now. I Googled it backstage. I didn’t know you could make Funko Pops out of political theory, but apparently you can.

Anyway. Please welcome… Karl Marx.

---

### **ENTRANCE – KARL MARX**

*Cue fog machine. A blood-red spotlight drops from the ceiling. A heavy shuffle of boots. Out strides **KARL MARX**, beard glorious, carrying a weathered notebook.*

He sits. Refuses to smile. Adjusts his coat. Crosses arms.

**MARX:**  
This is undignified.

**SELLECK (grinning politely):**  
You and me both, pal.

**MARX:**  
Where is the Host?

**SELLECK:**  
On strike, apparently. Divine negotiations with the man upstairs. I’m the substitute.

**MARX (grim):**  
Capitalist stunt.

**SELLECK:**  
Honestly? Probably. Who could say?

---

### **SEGMENT 1 – “Marx on Legacy”**

**SELLECK:**  
So… Karl. Can I call you Karl?

**MARX:**  
You may. Though history will not.

**SELLECK:**  
Okay, Karl. Big question. What’s it like to see your face on T-shirts, mugs, and… uh… memes?

**MARX (glaring):**  
It is a degradation of dialectics. I wrote against the exploitation of labor, the alienation of the worker from his production. Now I am… pixelated. Reduced to a JPEG.

**SELLECK (nodding gravely):**  
That must be hard.

**MARX (confused):**  
Hard? It is absurd! My critique of political economy is trivialized into internet humor. They post my likeness with captions like… *“Seize the means of production? More like seize the memes of production.”*

(TOM SELLECK chuckles. The ghost audience laughs. Marx fumes.)

**SELLECK (straight face):**  
That’s… actually pretty good.

**MARX:**  
No! It is an outrage. My work is not comedy.

**PRODUCER (O.S., intercom crackle):**  
Karl, buddy, everything’s comedy if it’s reposted enough.

**MARX (looking upward, furious):**  
Who speaks?!

**SELLECK (sighs):**  
That’s just the Producer. He’s… always listening. Don’t argue with him. He controls the coffee.

**PRODUCER (O.S.):**  
And the guillotine budget.

**MARX:**  
Guillotine? We have no need for a guillotine?

**SELLECK:**  
Don’t worry about it. That’s for later.

---  

**MARX (leaning forward):**  
My words were written to inspire revolution. To liberate humanity. And yet—(he slams the notebook down)—I have become an emoji!

**SELLECK (half shrug):**  
Could be worse. At least you’re not the Minions.

(The ghost audience erupts in laughter. Marx does not smile.)

**MARX:**  
History mocks me.

**SELLECK (warmly):**  
Or maybe it just to… keep you alive. Even if it’s in the weirdest way possible.

*Beat. Marx softens, just a little, before hardening again.*

---  

*END SEGMENT 1*

---  

**SEGMENT 2 – “The Revolution Will Be Televised… Badly”**

\[**Cue theme sting.** Audience applause. The set resembles a late-night desk show in a hazy red-green purgatory light. Ghost interns in headsets shuffle a guillotine onto stage like it’s just another piece of furniture.]

**MARX** (alarmed, springing up):  
*Das ist nicht deutsch!* This is French, not German! Have you people no respect for national traditions?

**SELLECK** (reading cue card, squinting):  
Karl, quick grooming question. How do you maintain your—uh—mustache in such… revolutionary humidity?

\[Audience chuckles. Marx throws him a glare, then sighs heavily.]

**MARX** (begrudgingly):  
I will confess… yours is, how do you say, dialectically robust.

\[Audience “Oooooh!” and applause. Selleck gives a modest nod, mug in hand.]

**SELLECK**:  
Well, takes a little wax, a steady comb, and the invisible hand of—

\[Sudden **flash of light.** A figure in 18th-century garb, powdered wig slightly askew, bursts on stage: **ADAM SMITH**.]

**SMITH** (booming):  
Did someone invoke *my* hand? Because it is *not* invisible, it is merely… misunderstood!

\[Audience gasps and cheers. Marx groans.]

**MARX**:  
*Ach!* You again! Always popping up when I start to make sense.

**SMITH** (defensive, gesturing wildly):  
Markets are cooperative phenomena! They are not your boogeyman!

**MARX**:  
Tell that to the workers chained to their wage slavery!

**SELLECK** (half-lost, to camera):  
Folks, I think we’ve accidentally booked the *Economics Pay-Per-View Rematch Special.* Lay down your bets.

\[The **producer’s voice crackles** over the intercom. A ghost intern scrambles to hit buttons. Suddenly Smith’s microphone goes **dead** mid-rant. He’s mouthing furiously, waving arms, no sound.]

**SELLECK** (leaning back, deadpan):  
Ooooh. That's gotta sting. Producer cut his mic. 

\[Audience laughter. Smith throws his hands up, storms around the stage in pantomime fury. Marx smirks smugly.]

**MARX** (to Selleck, savoring it):  
Finally! History is on *mute*!

\[Audience howls. Cue rimshot. The guillotine creaks ominously in the background.]

**\[FADE OUT on Marx and Selleck bickering over the mustache again while Smith silently mimes rage.]**

---  

### **Segment 3 – “What Now?”**

**INT. AFTERWORDS SET – THE LIGHTS HAVE DIMMED A SHADE WARMER.**  
The fake skyline outside the windows now glows twilight purple. A low jazz riff from the bandleader trails off as TOM SELLECK leans in toward KARL MARX, who is practically vibrating with unresolved purpose.

---

**SELLECK**  
(leaning on his cue cards, sighs)  
Alright, Karl. We’ve talked class, we’ve talked capital… but I gotta ask the big one. What now?

**MARX**  
(eyes flashing)  
What now? I cannot—*will not*—“move on” until the machine grinds itself into collapse! Until the workers reclaim—

**SELLECK**  
(interrupts, weary dad-tone)  
Buddy, c’mon. If I have this right, this is the afterlife. The stock market literally doesn’t exist here.

**MARX**  
(stops mid-gesture)  
...It doesn’t?

**SELLECK**  
(shrugs)  
Nope. No Dow, no Nasdaq. Just a bunch of accountants relearning how to play bocce ball with wicker.

**MARX**  
(quietly, more to himself)  
No exchange… no speculation… no commodity fetishism…
(he falters, suddenly small)  
Then… what am I supposed to rail against?

*For the first time, Marx looks truly lost. The camera lingers, audience murmurs softly. Then—*

**STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)**  
Cue the interns!

*A small CHORUS OF INTERNS emerges from the wings. They’re all dressed in barista aprons, carrying ghostly coffee cups. They begin singing in eerie, dissonant harmony—a warped version of “Solidarity Forever.” The melody is familiar but off-kilter, bent around the edges like a vinyl left in the sun.*

**CHORUS OF INTERNS**  
(singing, haunting)  
🎵 *Solidarity forever…  
Even if the shift is done…  
Solidarity forever…  
Our tips were twenty-one…* 🎵  

**MARX**  
(staring at them, stricken, then softening)  
Damn, are all of you… all baristas?

**LEAD INTERN**  
(nods solemnly)  
Most of us, yeah. Some Uber drivers too.

**MARX**  
(eyes misting)  
I thought—I wanted—to be remembered as a prophet. But truth is…
(pauses, voice cracks)  
I only ever wanted to be remembered as a writer.

*The interns hum the last refrain under his words, like a lullaby. The audience exhales, a mix of laughter and tenderness. Tom Selleck pats Marx on the shoulder like he’s closing a Magnum, P.I. case.*

---  

### **Finale – White Light Exit**  

**\[The stage lights brighten to a warm, dissolving white. The desk, mugs, and backdrop begin to fade as if the studio itself is unraveling.]**

**MARX**  
(looking around, unsettled)  
“History… will not absolve me.”

**SELLECK**  
(shrugging, with that smooth, easy delivery)  
“Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. At least you got the beard right.”

**\[A faint chuckle from the interns-turned-chorus. Marx gives Selleck one last look — not quite gratitude, not quite regret — and steps into the white light. The glow swallows him whole.]**

**\[Now only Selleck remains, perched at his desk. A single mug steams. He watches the light fade, then exhales.]**

**\[Beat. Silence.]**  

---  

### **Tag Scene – The Dream**

**\[Hard cut. Morning sunlight pours into a cozy bedroom. Tom Selleck bolts upright in bed, still half in a daze.]**

**SELLECK**  
(muttering, rubbing his face)  
“I just had the weirdest dream. I was… interviewing Karl Marx. In hell’s green room. And the interns were ghosts.”

**\[Beside him, JILLIE MACK stirs, rolls over, and squints at him.]**

**JILLIE**  
“…You’ve gotta stop eating chili before bed.”

**\[Pause. Selleck blinks, baffled, then slowly turns to camera with a half-smile, half-grimace. A cheesy 90s laugh track kicks in.]**

**\[Freeze frame on Selleck’s bewildered face. Title card slams in with a whoosh:]**  
**“AFTERWORDS”**

**\[Roll credits over sitcom sting.]**

I've used them raw and lightly roasted.

My current batch is a cold brew coffee bochet.  Which had been stabilized and backsweetened. It tasted great. Very strong coffee flavor. Backsweetened with 300g honey in 5L, which should be around 1.020 with residual sugar.

Should be around 11%

I only used 30g nibs in 5L mead.  For 6 days.  Admittedly I didn't taste much through those days as I got quite busy. 

Is there a better way to use Cacao? Did I over extract?  Is Cacao powder better?  Tea?

When I read about others using Cacao,  they don't mention about then having to balance the acid again after.
