1q0ut4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1q0ut4a/i_hate_the_baby_stage_so_much/,I hate the baby stage so much,"I hate the baby stage it's honestly awful I feel like a terrible mother for feeling this way and hate myself sometimes for it.  when I was in my early 20s raising  babies I don't remember it being this hard miserable or daunting. Now I'm in my mid 30s doing it all over again with a almost 1 yo I've realized I hate the baby stage. I say to myself every single day this is what living in hell feels like. I tell my husband this is the hell house made of nightmares. Now I get why some hope this life never finds them 

I miss my old life. I miss being able to sit on my couch and rot with a hot cup of coffee and a book. If I so much as look comfortable my baby will definitely find a leaf or something random on the floor no one else can see and put it in his mouth or decide he wants to meet the dog with violence. 

I miss being able to sit and talk with my husband and older kids. Playing boardgames watching  movies or tv, moving freely about my home whenever I want without having to worry about a baby eating dog food,  ripping apart everything in the house in 2.5 seconds or listening to crying from a gate. 

I miss sleep. I haven't had a full nights well rested sleep in well over a year. My baby still wakes up several times a night. Takes hours to go to bed. Rarely naps for longer than a hour. We cosleep I'm not interested in sleep training right now. Some nights he does sleep okay and goes to bed without a fight but most nights it's a battle. There is a heavy correlation between how well my baby does at bedtime and sleeps at night to how I feel the next day about my own existence 😂😭

I miss being able to shower whenever I want, eating food without standing while shoveling whatever quick bite I can find into my mouth. Sitting on the toilet without a small human grabbing at me. 

I'm so sick and tired of cleaning the stupid Ikea highchair 3+ times a day of food while yelling for my dog to come eat the scraps off the floor even though I just yelled at him 15 minutes before to get from the kitchen and away from the highchair. 

I'm constantly baby proofing, moving stuff, rearranging and deconstructing my house, buying shit in hopes it will make my life easier. Gates, storage, baby safety items, changing routines, planning and prepping and then the goal post moves. It's never enough. 

I miss being able to simply exist as a person without having to always be on so to speak. I feel like I'm in a constant state of survival mode and moving like everything is urgent. I have 20 minutes dishes, bottles, clean up, use the bathroom, find a snack, get a drink of water. Can't waste a single second. I feel ragged, worn down, physically, mentally and emotionally drained and exhausted. 

I love my little dude, seriously I do. I love waking up next to him in the morning and our babble chats at breakfast. Playing on the floor, reading our Barn Yard  dance book 847364 times a day and trips to the library.  Watching him grow and learn and take in the world. His sweet cuddles and the way we hold hands when he's laying down. 

JFC I feel like I've aged 10 years in 1 year. Have lost years off of life. Living like this feels so unhealthy and taxing. I know it gets better, that this is only a temporary season and before I know it these things will be non issues but wow it's hard
 when those days seem out of reach, nowhere insight. 

ETA I was diagnosed with ppd a while ago. I do take medication and see a therapist. I also have ADHD and take medication for that too. ",2,1767238732.0,breakingmom,2,1.0,False
1q0ut2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement_IN/comments/1q0ut2g/perfecting_the_product_estimation_question_an/,Perfecting the Product Estimation Question: An End-to-End Guide and Walkthrough Solution,"When I first saw product estimation questions in interviews, I froze. The math felt intimidating, and I had no idea where to start (especially with my lack of mental math skills).

I eventually realized interviewers are not testing whether you land on the “correct” number. They’re testing whether you can:

1. structure an ambiguous problem,
2. make grounded assumptions, and
3. focus on the few drivers that matter.

Here's a repeatable framework to answer product estimation questions with minimal memorization:

**1) Clarify the ask (30 seconds)**  
Scope, timeframe, the company, product, success metrics etc. and how detailed they want the answer.

**2) Pick the right framework (5 options)**  
Most questions fit into one of these:

* Top-down (start with population, filter down)
* Bottom-up (start with a unit, scale up)
* Funnel (conversion at each step)
* Frequency × penetration (users × % who do it × how often)
* Fermi decomposition (for curveballs)

**3) Segment MECE + sanity check**  
Avoid overcomplicating inputs, then validate with a quick “1 in N” check or capacity check. For example, to apply the ""1 in N"" check, if you assume that there are 10 million coffees consumed each day in NYC - dividing that by 8 million (number of NYC residents) - that's 1.25 coffees per person. Gauge if that sounds correct.

Estimation questions can feel tricky to apply in practice, so I walk through a full, end-to-end solution **step by step** [**here**](https://youtu.be/jH_cKolMPX0?si=6YMtAPJ8J1aAea_8). I break down the popular estimation question: “Estimate the number of pennies in Manhattan” and show how to structure the problem, make reasonable assumptions, and sanity check the result.

1q0uqla,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1q0uqla/my_parents_refuse_to_talk_to_my_inlaws/,My parents refuse to talk to my in-laws,"Hey everyone, my husband and I (both 24) have been married for almost 3 years and have been together 5. In that time frame, our parents have interacted only a handful of times at important life events (both of our families are local), but each and every conversation has only been initiated by my in-laws. My family is pretty standoffish in general, and neither of them have many friends. They do love and interact with my husband though. 

I pretty much have the dream situation when it comes to my in-laws. They welcomed me in with open arms immediately and have been so kind to me. My husband and I just had our first baby in August and they’ve been so involved while also respecting whatever boundaries we have. My MIL regularly has offered to come clean my apartment for me while I was both pregnant and postpartum if that tells you what kind of person she is. 

My mom hasn’t said anything to me specifically, but I’ve always had this feeling she doesn’t care for my mother in law even though I’ve given her no reason to dislike her. Before we got engaged, my MIL asked my mom to coffee to get to know each other since they hadn’t met and I never heard of anything that went wrong.

When we were in the wedding planning stage, my MIL offered to throw me a bridal shower. When I brought it up to my mom, she got offended saying “Well usually it’s the MOH’s duty to throw your shower.” The thing is, my MOH never offered to throw me one. So my MIL threw me my bridal shower. Apparently my parents never thanked my in-laws for hosting my bridal shower or the wedding rehearsal dinner and made zero effort to talk to them at all during any of our wedding events, including the actual wedding day. 

My in-laws have reached out to my parents multiple times to try and get together because in their eyes we’re all considered family, and once kids come into the picture they just want to be friendly when it comes to all the grandchildren events. I also think they’re used to be BIL’s wife’s parents being a lot more involved with them. They aren’t best friends, but they are super friendly during any joint events. My parents have just either rejected or just flat out ignored anytime they have reached out. 

At my baby shower it genuinely just felt so awkward because I felt like I had to split my time up with both my families because they just won’t talk to each other. My MIL went up to try and talk to my mom and she talked to her for maybe a couple minutes before my mom went to find her best friend and wouldn’t talk to anyone else the whole time. I will give props to my dad for going to sit with my in-laws and talked to them for the majority of the time. Even our grandmas were chatting it up and getting along. 

My final straw was my mom complaining afterwards to me that at the baby shower, my husband’s aunt “put my brother (16) on the spot and made him uncomfortable”. I asked what happened and all she did was ask him if he was “shy like his sister.” I told her that she can come off as a little strong sometimes but I swear she means well. My mom flipped on me saying that “She’s allowed to have a different opinion than me and just because she has a different opinion doesn’t mean she’s wrong.” I simply told her I didn’t appreciate her bashing my in-laws in front of me because it made me uncomfortable. She then got super defensive and goes “Oh that’s what you think we were doing?” Even though my dad had just been complaining over finding my husband’s aunt annoying right in front of me. 

I just don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t really expect them to be best friend but I wish there wasn’t this tension. I also don’t want to be stressing at every event for our kids over how awkward things are going to be with everyone together. Has anyone been through anything like this before? Is this normal and do I just need to suck it up? ",1,1767238489.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False

I thanked the all from comms for all their help. Wyett being busy and the rest of the  compostwr were busy so a Random pilot flew me down.

When we landed near the buildings the small vehicle was there. We loaded my stuff then the staffs stuff on the vehicle. Droped off everybody outfit to city hall then my stuff to my house. 

I was surprised to see an Ykanti female and a human male cleaning my house. 

I went into the bakery and got some croisant for breakfast and coffee.

Aino showed me to my office on the third floor accross his new office.

I asked Aino to please send all those that are bookepers to see me so I can interview them. No rush tho.

When I was coming to City Hall I saw a Baronry shuttle flying with a Baco under it. I saw it lowering it beside other heavy machinery in a row and dropping it gently.

It then landed to unload all kind of cases of nails shovels and many other tools to build things.
.
Can't wait to get the tablets I will be instantly capable to communicate with all residents.

I was in the office 1 hour when the florist delivered me flowers for my office.

First bookeeper came to meet me. Found out he use to do the books for restaurants. I asked if he would mind doing the books with assistance for the restaurants and the Inn. Aino gave him a desk upstairs. He will introduce himself to the main cooks of each place. I need to give each place a ledger to keep debit and credit ledgers. He will teach them how to fill them.

I will need laptops for all bookepers. An accounting program should be procured for the baronry also. Note to Wyett the need.

Even tho most records will be digital we might need shelves built as a file system or should we get lockable file cabinets.

Got a away board for my door. When ever I have errands I can close my door and leave a note of where I went to.

Found out there are two Ykanti restaurants. I never tried Ykanti food so will have supper at one of them tonight.

Ok many bookeepers interviewed today. I will get a few to help me with the Baronry. A few more to help with the General. Wyett ask me if I could help the General so of course I agrreed. Mind you That is so much money for me to handle. I can handle it. 

We need to also get real credits. I will try to get space in the new station. This would be a great place to have a space to advertise vacations in Newtown. Sell beer etc to Station. Provide fresh foods to Gardens and station. Last but not least sell our souvenirs to captains in bulk to resell. We would need sample flown in each day to sell and demonstrate.

Dealing in Haego is fine but real people with real credits are in space.

1q0unez,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1q0unez/trip_planning_itinerary_check/,Trip Planning - Itinerary Check,"Hi all,

  
I'm starting to plan a 10-day Iceland trip for June 2026 for a family of 3. We have a 9yo with us. I've spent quite some time tweaking an itinerary generated by ChatGPT 5.2 and came up with the itinerary below.

  
The reason I used GPT is because I want to book the hotels ASAP since we are a bit late already (I think), and then figure out the details of the trip. However the details of the trip (where to go, when...etc) can affect the hotels that I book, particularly how many nights at each location, and where.

  
Could you please help me take a look and let me know whether there are any glaring holes in this itinerary? I added a few preferences such as: only surrounding areas of Reykjavik and the south coast, no north coast (not doing the whole ring road). Avoid 1 night per location.  No strenuous hikes (due to the young kid).

  
Itinerary below is 2 nts at Reykjavik, 3 nts at Vik, 2 nts at Jökulsárlón, then 2 nts at Reykjavik again.

TIA!

1q0ukp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HangDogCityLimits/comments/1q0ukp1/meet_me_at_hangdog_city_limits_1/,Meet me at Hangdog City Limits 1,"The Rycacians are on stage in front of an energetic crowd. There are four of them, three males and a female, and an unattended mic stand center stage. Most humans would say they look a bit like dogs around the head, with a long muzzle and large, expressive ears. The female has an intricate coat pattern of stripes and spots, her mane scattered black, white, and silver and she’s wearing quite a bit of jewelry. The bass player is gray with darker stripes and mane, the guitar and drum players are white and brown, respectively, with darker manes.



""Oh he is? Alright! I'm Benni, this is our guitarist Vincent, Mac on bass, Rick is our drummer and...""



The lead singer enters stage left and the crowd breaks into cheers and applause. Benni looks him up and down and makes a face. He’s not particularly tall, rather gangly, a bit scruffy, with uniform tawny brown fur and a mane of the same color. He also looks like he’s been rolling around in the dirt. 

  


He takes a mic. ""What?""

  


""How'd you get so dusty?"" Benni asks. 

  


He looks down at himself and slaps at his pants, a cloud rises around him and the crowd laughs. ""I live on a dirt road."" The crowd whoops and laughs.

  


""And after his long, loooong, loooong ride down that dirt road to get here-""

  


Benni stops mid sentence and coughs, goes over to get a bottle of water and takes several swallows. Dusty rolls his eyes and motions ‘wanking it’. Benni returns to center stage, gives him a stern look, then raises a hand. “Two.. three…four!”



Rycacia is dominated by two species belonging to a single genus, “Marasattus”, or, as they are generally called, Marasats. There are other species of Marasat, they are a colonizing race, but none of the other highly intelligent ones live here. The two that are here are listed in human life-form databases as “Marasattus ornamens” and “Marasattus rycacianna”. The primary difference is that “ornamens” lives mostly under the surface, and “rycacianna” live up on top.



Marasattus rycacianna is comprised of two subtypes, ‘Greater’ and ‘Lesser’ Rycacian Marasats, respectively. The only obvious physical difference is that Lesser Marasats always appear to have a uniform tawny brown coat of fur, and the Greater generally have various patterns and markings and tend to be very slightly larger.



The Lesser Rycacian Marasats are closer genetically to ‘ornamens’, they still have a few traits the others have completely lost. They appear an unimpressive brown color under most light found on the surface, but they can and do bioluminesce under the right conditions. They can also generate enough of an electrical charge to give an attacker a thoroughly bad time.





Dusty, therefore, is a Lesser Marasat, the rest of the band are Greater Marasats. The genes associated with the Lesser Marasats are recessive but very common, there’s about a one in five chance you’ll get them with two Greater Marasats. There are lots of them around, and most of them aren’t related.

  


Several days later, a little tawny brown Rycacian child is standing the window, looking out into the night. Her name is Diesel, she and Dusty are related, she’s his daughter. She appears to be around the equivalent of a four or five year old human, she can speak clearly and is able to feed and dress herself but will be referred to as a “baby” until her natural defense system develops, which will be a few years still. It’s way past her bedtime, she’d spent the last couple hours laying in bed under a pile of blankets pretending to be asleep every time her mother opened the door to check on her. It’s late enough now that her mother will have decided it’s OK to leave her completely alone until it’s time to get up. She used to come in constantly all night, but her dad had finally gotten the message through that waking a kid up every hour was definitely not healthy.

  


The bedroom door opens and Dusty pokes his head in. ""Hey, I thought you were supposed to be in bed.""

  


Diesel shakes her head absently. ""It's too loud.""

  


“Up here?” Dusty motions to her head, and she nods. He leaves briefly and returns with a pair of headphones. ""Do NOT tell Mommy I did this.""

  


He almost runs into his wife, Sophia, in the hall a minute later. She’s irritated at him, as usual. ""Where have you been?"" 



""Up on Factory Road."" Dusty instinctively brushes dirt off of himself.



""Doing what?"" Sophia snaps.



""Fixin that old clunker Mac's dad left him."" Dusty refuses to play into her aggression.



“Oh, come on. That piece of shit is never gonna fly again.”Sophia rolls her eyes.



“Of course it will. It’s all mechanical.” Dusty shrugs.



“Get a job and buy a real ship.” Sophia says.



“You get a job and buy a real ship if you want one so bad.” Dusty says.



Sophia narrows her eyes at him, but she really doesn’t have much of a defense against that since she could theoretically be pulling in a paycheck. There isn’t any reason Dusty can’t just take Diesel with him everywhere, and he’s perfectly willing to do so, but Sophia objects on the grounds that the baby will get broken.



Dusty finds that attitude incredibly irritating because he comes from Hangdog, a particularly challenging area of the environment, and has a history of climbing mountains and walking across deserts with random babies clinging off of him like little opossums. If you stand still long enough over there, some ankle biter will adhere itself to you and you’ll have a little voice squeaking questions in your ear until someone pries them off and hauls them back home or they find someone more interesting to latch onto. The second he was physically large enough, his younger siblings and relatives had been all over him. He has a



What Dusty is doing now is basically what he was doing back then, as a courier across areas that require a land vehicle and member of a moderately successful rock band. Neither of those are particularly dangerous, most of his friends are musicians and therefore ‘weird’ to some degree but none of them are violent and lots of them have children of their own they haul around with them.



Several days later, the clunker is in repairs. It...does not look amazing. The ship is old, and it’s been allowed to sit in a barn for decades. But it was made by some human somewhere, and machines made by humans can be fixed. Human machines don’t care where something came from or what it’s made of, it’s about pushing and pulling and moving electricity from one place to another. You can cannibalize other machines, even replace parts with organic components, if it works it works. There are plenty of human machines around here, old cars and trucks and the occasional ship. 

  


They could theoretically just replace the mechanical components with organic ones, you can buy a kit that will supposedly do it from the Marasats. But it’s not just about having a working method of transportation, it’s about aesthetic. And besides, they all like the human tech, you can see what things do, and humans spend a lot of time documenting everything. There had been piles of paper instructions stashed in the cockpit repair box, apparently the human that made it had been sure to keep everything that came packaged with the components. 

  


It was legitimately a bit of a mess, everything that wasn’t made of metal had fallen apart and it’s definitely got some rust issues, but it’s far from a lost cause. Mac is the only one in his family who can understand any of the human languages without a translator, which is why he’d eventually been saddled with the ship. Mac definitely wouldn’t try to go long distances, and there's no way its safe for actual space travel right now, but the engine does turn over and they’ve gotten her in the air a couple times.  



Dusty has Diesel with him today, she’s sitting in a little pink chair, crumbling up a granola bar and feeding it to several rather overweight pigeons. There are more of the birds hanging around in what’s left of the old barn.



The birds abruptly fly away and Diesel points. ""What's that, daddy?""

  


The adults all stop what they are doing and look, Vincent slowly lowers the tool in his hand. ""Fuck me.""

  


Large black nematode-like creatures are swarming toward them, moving incredibly fast. They topple and roll over trees, leaving slimy wreckage that emits a noxious chemical mist. There’s nowhere for the Rycacians to go but into the ship and hopefully up. The engine catches immediately and Vincent yanks the controls upward, the stabilizers aren't working correctly and they rock and shudder but the ship is able to rise and hover. There is a rough circle of destruction, structures collapse, something is on fire, vehicles tear away as people frantically flee the area. 

  


""What the everloving fuck!” Dusty says angrily. “Why are there so many of them? Where the fuck did they all come from!""

  


Benni is standing in front of her bar, a hand shading her eyes. She’d heard the alert go off and is now watching as emergency vehicles stream by in both directions. The affected area covers where Dusty lives, she’d tried to contact him but first gotten no answer and then a message that the system was temporarily down. Mac and Vincent hadn’t answered, either, she’d gotten hold of Rick but he was miles away at some symposium. 

  


These animals had started appearing not too long before Benni joined the band. Nobody seems to be sure exactly where they came from, they aren’t native, but what is obvious is that they are rapidly evolving into a massive problem. They seem to be able to shake off most of what the Rycacians, humans, and everybody else has been able to throw at them so far, and the response is becoming steadily more aggressive.

  


A particularly gnarly POS limps over and stall/lands in the lot behind the bar. Benni goes back to see if it's somebody she knows and is very relieved to find her missing friends. Mac takes Diesel, and they and Vincent go inside. 

  


""How bad is it?"" Benni asks. 

  


Dusty shakes his head. ""It's bad. BAD bad.""

  


An emergency siren begins to wail. Dusty grabs her hand and pulls Benni inside, slams the door. Ship engines roar overhead, followed by a thin mist of falling particulate. The guys have turned the news on and are both watching the screen, Diesel is sitting on the bar between them. She’s gotten hold of Vincent’s hat and is slowly filling it with shredded napkins.



""Does that shit actually do anything?"" Benni asks. 

  


""Besides killing our kids?"" Dusty narrows his eyes as another wave of ships pass over, dumping chemicals.

  


Dusty is being somewhat dramatic, the various chemicals they’re using tend to irritate mucus membranes and cause digestive upset, a kid will feel kinda rotten for a day or two if they get a face full, but it certainly won’t kill them. Not even Diesel, who has a medical condition that, according to her mother, is severe.



Benni isn’t sure about that, though. Not the part about Diesel having a diagnosis, that’s true and she was typically symptomatic when she was a little younger. She should have grown out of most of that by now, though, and Benni strongly suspects that the persistent symptoms are not directly related to her illness. Sophia hovers over the child, treating her as though she’ll shatter if you breathe on her too hard, hardly letting her outside, pumping her full of supplements and medications and making her do all sorts of exercises that were supposed to do...whatever. What they are actually doing is making everyone involved completely miserable.

  


Dusty, in typical fashion, ignores the instruction sheets that are always pinned to the girl’s shirt and follows what is actually medically best practice- which is to just treat her like a normal child. Dusty carries her around with him everywhere, and if he doesn’t have her in his arms or on his shoulders, one of the others does. This isn’t because she has trouble getting around, quite the opposite- if you put her down, she’ll immediately zip off and find something to get into.



The door opens and a male human steps in, he’s wearing a uniform that marks him as belonging to ISTC, the organization aiding in the current extermination effort. He looks around, taking a head count, then leaves without saying anything. That isn’t surprising, most of them don’t speak Rycacian very well, and they’re too far from a base for them to assume the Rycacians here would speak a human language. 

  


Dusty has a keen interest in humans, but it’s focused almost exclusively on ancient Earth culture and the English language circa the 20th century. It is effectively a dead language, mostly used as part of historical reproductions or novelty acts. Most of the humans that come here, therefore, don’t hold much interest for him. There had been one he was very interested in for awhile before he met Sophia, nasty little thing, even for a human. She’d eventually been fired or thrown in jail or murdered or something. Good riddance to bad rubbish.

Twenty years later…

  


A female officer is sitting in one of the generic security stations on Falcron Station with her feet up on a panel. Her name is May, she looks human and thoroughly bored. She sits up abruptly and leans forward, taps the display and brings up Dusty’s ID from the local database. She accesses the information for his transportation and looks at the ship specs, then footage of it from the landing bay. It’s a piece of shit, it’s amazing it even makes it up here. 

  


She taps the display several more times and pulls up the complete inspection report, then details of the ‘audio equipment’ and looks down the list. There are a few things that stand out, though they aren’t illegal, just a little odd. The guitars are ‘vintage’, old wood and fiberglass, and should have come fitted with adapters for the Marasat audio processors. But they have the cables listed, and after a second she finds a few amplifiers, it looks like they’re only using the adapters to feed it into the main audio system for the venue. The mics they have are the same, cables that run across the stage and will trip you up if you don’t pay attention and are dancing around the way Dusty likes to. There is a magnetic reel-to-reel recorder that doesn’t have any adapters except for the power source, an old boom box that records on magnetic cassettes, an ancient video camera that records on VHS, a very old sound mixing board, and a few other apparently random pieces of ancient equipment that would require the end result be run through a converter to play anywhere other than somewhere that has actual speakers made accept the input- which they don’t have on the ship, but they do have some headphones so they must at least occasionally record on it. Why? To get stuff that sounds more ‘authentic’ to the originals style? Why not just record on modern equipment then run it through a filter or just press it into vinyl and get all those nice clicks and pops from the record player? She knows for a fact that Factory Deal sells actual records, she’s got a few of the older albums and she’s seen the new ones for sale around here.

  


""Computer, will you bring up security footage from their last visit ordered chronologically, please?"" The screen goes black, then begins with the bay security cameras. 

  


“Spin on.” May says and the footage speeds up until she motions for it to return to normal speed. The drone security at Club Mango, following them as they go through the maze of backstage halls. They veer off when the band enters a green room and the footage switches to the show floor feed, the drones circling the stage and getting close ups of the band members. Dusty is absent, a drone finds him just off stage, talking to one of the dancers. 

  


May has the footage back up and slow down, she manages to catch a few frames of his kid, it must be since she looks just like him, sitting backstage at some sort of control setup. They’re using the vintage mic and guitar cables, but they run into the audio equipment for the club. They definitely aren’t using the vintage recording and mixing equipment here, they must have left it on the ship.



May motions at the screen and it starts to play again, now circling the band members. Benni looks irritated, Dusty is missing, he comes onto stage after long enough to let the viewers know he’s officially late. Dusty immediately starts talking, the drone footage is focused in on him, switching from full body to close up shots of his face.



He’s extremely expressive, his body language exuberantly friendly. Once the band strikes up and he starts singing, May knows he’ll be dancing around on stage. He probably won’t do it at Mango, but he’ll get down in the audience and shit, too.

  


""Wake up!"" Someone jostles her seat hard enough to make May jump. 

  


""What!"" May twists around to find Rahal. 

  


Rahal is a security officer as well, though she’s considerably younger than May. She was assigned to Falcron a few years ago, and quickly became what the station supervisor referred to as May’s Minion. 

  


“He's hot, isn't he.” Rahal says. 

  


“Adam?” May asks. 

  


“Adam? Who’s Adam, wasn’t that…oh my GOD you KNOW him know him!” Rahal hoots.

  


May grabs her arm. ""Shut up! You want everybody to know?""

  


""Kinda"" Rahal giggles. 

  


“Look, that was a really long time ago.” May says. “I haven’t talked to him in, like, forever.”  

  


“Did you just, like, know him socially or…” Rahal prompts. 

  


“I refuse to answer that question.” May says. “Don’t you have work to do?” 

  


""Sir, yes sir."" Rahal salutes and squawks like a chicken. 

  


It takes a very special sort of person to live and work long term on this particular station. Falcron was originally manufactured during eradication efforts on the planet below, controlled by ISTC, who regulates travel and shipping between planets. After the eradication, the station was expanded and is now largely dedicated to shopping and entertainment. There are around a thousand permanent residents, around half of which were displaced by the infestation. The expansion was done by Marasats, who were very well meaning in their attempts to create a pleasant human habitat but missed the mark slightly. 

  


The aesthetic modeling hides it in the civilian areas, but you’ll still start to see things that are just a bit off after awhile. The way things don't “start” and “stop”, they grow from each other, the way nothing ever seems to have a straight edge, the way the layout of the corridors doesn't actually make any sense. The material behind the manufactured panels is a network of glowing roots and bulbs that twitch and flash as signals run through. In the lower decks, it doesn't even look vaguely like a station anymore, just tunnels of flora occupied by Marasats and the occasional other bizarre life form. 

  


For some reason which has baffled everyone, the place is also home to a thriving colony of pigeons. They perch, nest, and poop where they like, and are impossible to get rid of. 

  


""Computer."" May says when she’s alone again. 

  


""Yes, Captain?"" The computer speaks in a soothing but no-nonsense female voice. 

  


""Oh, I like that one."" May says. ""What voice is that?""

  


""This voice is labeled ""Ship Computer Wife Classic"", Captain.""

  


""Do you always have to call me 'Captain'?"" May asks.

  


""Yes, Captain."" The computer says somewhat sarcastically. 

  


May makes a face. ""Fine, whatever. Can you look up this band, Factory Deal?""

  


""What would you like to know?""

  


“Let me see their finances.” May says, then, after looking for a minute, “That can’t be right. They’re flying around in a fifty year old hunk of junk, why would they…is it just aesthetic? Do they own properties or something?”

  


“Factory Road Productions, registered landowners.” A flyover comes up. 

  


It looks like it was an actual industrial facility at some point, and it's clearly out in the wastelands somewhere. It looks effectively inaccessible except by ship, surrounded by jagged canyons. She can see the remains of a road, it looks like there had been a bridge at one point but it’s either washed out or been destroyed some other way. It looks like the place has a sky rat problem, too, there are pigeons all over the place.

  


“Do we have better footage?” May asks. 

  


The computer thinks for a few seconds, then begins to play various clips from interviews and music videos. There

  


“Can you bring up footage of his kid?” May asks. “What’s her name?”

  


“Diesel, ‘Baby D’, age 25.” A video comes up. Diesel is on stage in front of a crowd, a banner behind her reads “Falcron Hospital Annual Benefit Concert”.



At 25, she’s adult, but probably still living with her parents. They don’t tend to leave until they have a good reason, which is generally lack of space. Given the size of their facility, it’s likely anybody she’s involved with will end up moving out there. The Rycacians always live in groups, it’s very rare to see less than three at any given time.  

  


“When I was little, little little, I got sick, y’all. Bad. I thought I was gonna die. Everybody *else* thought I was gonna die. But then, the power of music cured me.” Diesel pauses to let the crowd react. “No, seriously, y’all, let's hear it for the excellent staff at Falcron Hospital, they save lives, please donate generously.”

  


May leans back, shakes her head slowly. She looks almost exactly like Dusty, she’s got to be straight Lesser Marasat. Benni certainly couldn’t be her biological mother.



“Computer, is Dusty currently-” May starts to ask but is interrupted by a voice behind her.





""Misuse of company resources!"" The voice of their resident bureaucrat, Neil Pendergrass.

  


May turns around to find Neil jabbing a finger in her face. He seems to have made a hobby of finding reasons to write her up. This has had absolutely no effect on her behavior, and only results in getting angry messages about excessive paperwork.

  


""Oh, blow me."" May says. ""537B, Cornelia Robinson, refuses to clean up after her dog. You can catch her if you hurry, he's five million years old and it takes awhile for him to pop a-""

  


Neil throws his hands up. ""Fine, you’re monitoring the place! That still doesn't make watching a show work related.”

  


“It might be, though.” May says. “You know anything about this ‘Dusty’ character?” 

  


Neil blinks at her in surprise. “The singer? I’ve heard they do a lot of charity stuff and he’s supposed to be pretty nice. Was that who you were looking at?”

  


“I knew him, about a million years ago.” May says. “We lost touch.”

  


“That is *super* not work related.” Neil says. 

  


“Well, no. But…look at that ship, and they apparently live in an actual, like, factory. Or what's left of one.” May says. 

  


“I mean, I think that's sort of their thing. They leaned into the post-apocalyptic vibe pretty hard.” Neil says. 

  


“But they get paid, right? The statements show transfers.” May says. “So where is it all going?”

  


Neil sighs and brings the records up. “Well, RCV and GER are both environmental restoration, GRNR and CRME are nature management, RBR and TWS are family and housing…looks like the last time they hit Mango the profits went to the hospital here on Falcron, here’s a couple that look like local clinics. I’d say offhand the most likely thing would be petty tax and fee evasion, hardly something nefarious and definitely not our jurisdiction."" 

  


“I saw him at Mango.” May says.

  


“Ok.” Neil says. “And he was flashing wads of cash?”

  


“No.” May laughs. 

  


“Then it was probably nothing. Get back to work.” Neil says. 



May had been at Club Mango last night to look at the stage, but had been called away to deal with a situation in another establishment. The place is closed for patrons this time of day, but the doors open automatically to let her in. She hasn’t seen it with the lights up since it was constructed. The ceiling is so high, it vanishes into shadow. The wall across from the main entrance is occupied by a large stage, three sections making a slight curve. Behind the center section, a rectangular scaffold extends thirty feet into the air. Several pigeons are sitting on it, more are scattered around on the support beams for the lights and effects. There is a Marasat crouched at a panel by the stage, messing with something.

  


“Hello.” May says. “What's your designation?”

  


“Code.” A mix of voices, male and female. 

  


“Do you like music?” May asks.

  


“Yes, we enjoy music.” The Marasat says. 

  


“Were you here for Factory Deal?” 

  


“Program 23 sequence 8.” The Marasat says. 

  


“Oh, for the stage?” May says. “Can I see it? Up close?” 

  


“Your clearance allows it.” Code says. 

  


A few minutes later, May is standing on a narrow platform, looking out over nothing. She’s taken off her shoes, jacket, and most of the random crap she carries around.  The frame in front of her is completely empty. She had expected to see *something*, but there aren't even crossrails up right now. She reaches out and puts her hand through, nothing but air. 

  


“Activating.” Code says. 

  


The air shimmers slightly, like a heat mirage, and the pigeons fly away making disgruntled sounds. When May puts her hand out again, it gives slightly then becomes solid. She steps up onto the frame, then puts a foot out and tests the surface. It feels like a gymnastic mat, gives a little but obviously solid. She steps out onto nothing and walks across to the middle. 

  


“Three, two, one.” Code says. 

  


The invisible surface vanishes and May yelps as she drops sharply, convinced for a second she is going to splat on the floor below. She stops in the middle section. Just, stops. No surface to stand on, she can twist freely. Gravity gently returns, but now it's pulling her to stage left. She turns to orient herself, and her feet hit an invisible wall/floor. May kicks off and the gravity vanishes, returns to orient her toward the other side. 



She points down toward the frame below her and snaps her fingers, the edges glow, then gravity pulls her down and she’s standing on a ‘floor’. She walks over and kneels down, looking at the places where the frame joins together. There are little arrays of flora there, covered with some sort of rubbery housing. She knows what it looks like inside, she’s more interested in where and how it’s getting power.



This device doesn’t actually do anything to gravity, not really. What it does looks like zero-g, and feels very similar, but isn’t. This stage is creating a space within a space and then rotating it around the people inside, gravity is always pulling ‘down’, but ‘down’ in relation to what is inside changes.



She makes an “up” motion, and the floor takes her to the top of the array and stops. May looks up, frowns, it’s dark up there. She stands looking up, squinting into the shadows, long enough for a pigeon to come land on her shoulder.



“You nest up there?” May asks. The bird shakes it’s head, May nods. “That’s what I thought.”

  


As May is returning to her quarters later, she sees a band poster has been stuck to her door. Factory Deal, of course. It’s not for an upcoming show, though, or the most recent one. This poster is old, printed off at someone's house on paper that’s starting to yellow and crumble at the edges. 

  


In her room, May pokes the display screen at the bottom of her bed with a foot. “Hey, you got a discography for Factory Deal?”

  


“Sure, hun, got that right here for you.” The computer says. 

  


“Oh, that’s….which voice is that?” May asks. 

  


“It’s called ‘That One Lady Dontcha Know’.” The computer says. 

  


May shakes her head. “Play something.”

  


“This one’s called ‘Lady at the Fuel Stop’, hun.” 

  


May huffs a laugh. The tune is catchy, but the lyrics leave something to be desired. They’re mostly in Rycacian, with a few common and easily recognizable words and phrases in English- “sexy lady”, “pickup truck”, “pump my gas”. 

  


“What about something else? They have anything that's not hot chicks and fast cars?” May asks. 

  


“The title of this song is ‘Roof for Relaxing’, it's very popular, dontcha know.” That One Lady says. 

  


This one is leaning into punk rock pretty hard, and tells a somewhat cohesive though comedic story where noise complaints against the band escalate and are retaliated against, eventually devolving into a riot, war, and the planet exploding while the band plays on. May has a sneaking suspicion someone actually did file a noise complaint and this was the band’s way of telling them exactly where they could shove their opinion.



The door opens and Rahal comes in. “What's that?”

  


“Your favorite band.” May says. 

  


“Play a video.” Rahal says. 

  


“Sure, hun, which one you want?” The computer asks. 

  


“Do you have one from Blue Star?” May asks. 

  


“Sure, hun. Here you go.”

  


Blue Star is on Rycacia, May had picked it because she knew he used to play there. The place has obviously undergone some renovations and updates, but it’s still only big enough for maybe two hundred people. The house lights are on low, even though the stage lights are fully up. Most of the patrons are standing close to the stage. The band is already up there, sans Dusty who comes out fashionably late. He starts talking to the crowd, getting down at the edge of the stage to pass things back and forth. Rahal is listening to his schtik, which is quite entertaining, but May is watching Dusty closely. After awhile, Benni breaks up the socializing and they start playing music. Dusty is dancing around with the mic, getting up close with the other band members, making eye contact and gesturing to the crowd. They’re obviously all just having a good time out there. 

  


“That looks like fun.” Rahal says.



They’ve stopped playing, and Dusty is addressing the audience again. “I was down in Hangdog the other day. You guys know where that is?”

  


May leans forward and frowns, she’s just spotted a couple pigeons hanging out on one of the lighting rails.

  


A smattering of applause. Dusty points and waves at them. “Hey, y’all! How's your mom n ‘em?” Laughter, someone shouts an answer, more laughter. “Oh, well when they get out the hospital you tell them that's why we don't drink n drive. So I was out there, five million miles from nowhere, cause my dear old Mama lives there.”

  


The audience makes cooing sounds and he waves them off. “Oh, no, y’all, she ain't that kind of mama. No, no, she’s great though, seriously. Anyway, I was down there and she told me, she said ‘Son, I don’t like your music.” The audience laughs as Dusty arches an eyebrow. “Right? She said ‘Son, I don't like your music but there must be something to it because they play it on the radio here. All. The. Time.” The audience cheers. “And she turned on the radio and goddamn, ‘Road Home’ was on!” He lets the audience react for a few seconds, then talks over them. “And I said, that's just a fluke and she said ‘oh, no, this is *request only*. So if anybody from over there is watching, we appreciate it, guys.”

  


“You ok, Boss?” Rahal asks. 

  


May doesn’t turn from the screen. “Fine, why?”

  


“You’ve been kind of…” Rahal hesitates. “Interested in Dusty.”

  


“It’s nothing.” May says. “How much do you know about him?” 

  


“I mean, I read tabloids sometimes.” Rahal says. “Apparently he has trouble with women, can’t imagine why.” 

  


“He’s always broke, for one.” May says. “Money goes in one hand and right out the other, always has, looks like it still does.” 

  


“He does…like…girls, right?” Rahal asks. 

  


“As far as I know, why?” May asks. “Are you interested?” 

  


“Me? No, that’s…they’re hot and all, but…” Rahal shakes her head. “They’re a little…furry…for me, I think.” 

  


“That’s fine, you don’t have to want to fuck them.” May says. “You can like the way someone looks in a not-sexy way, that’s OK.”

  


“He’s, like, *with* Vincent, though, isn’t he? Like, it says stuff about him dating and shit but…” Rahal says. 

  


“I don’t know him anymore.” May says. “I have no idea. What about other stuff?”

  


“Didn’t he get arrested for environmental terrorism or something?” Rahal asks. 

  


“That was a long time ago, and he didn’t get arrested.” May says. “He got questioned because he was in the wrong place at the right time.”

  


“I thought Vincent had to sell his ship to bail him out.” Rahal says. 

  


“Nah, they got rid of it because it was costing them an arm and a leg to maintain. Those things look great but break down all the time, and you have to get them fixed at a dealer.” May says. “I was there for that.”

  


“Security to Deck 12 for a…disturbance.” The dispatch comes in, stopping their conversation. “126 and Oak.”

  


Deck 12 is lower rent civilian shopping, and designed to look like a street with storefronts. The ceiling is made of video panels, theoretically they’re supposed to show a view of a sky but the powers that be like to play random but aesthetic footage. Right now, it’s a mass of pink jellyfish. A group of people have gathered in front of two businesses, they can hear female voices shouting at each other, presumably the owners of said businesses. One is a pet store, the other sells herbal remedies. 

  


“Arrest her!” The pet store owner screams when she sees the officers. “She’s killing my babies!”

  


“Ma’am…” May says. 

  


“She’s crazy!” The other woman shouts. “The smell of imitation chocolate can not poison her dogs!”

  


“What about the other stuff! It’s toxic to animals! Your tea is killing my fish!” Pet Store lady screams. 

  


“Are you dumping it in the tank?” Tea Lady retorts. 

  


“Y’all…” May groans. 

  


“She has to move!” Pet Store Lady insists. 

  


“You move!” Tea Lady snaps back. 

  


“How many of your animals are dead?” May asks. 

  


“Well, none yet but…” Pet Store Lady admits. 

  


“And you’ve both been here how long?” May asks. 

  


“Five years, but…” Pet Shop Lady says. 

  


“So, you want me to arrest her for not killing your animals for five years?” May asks. “I’m confused.”

  


“The fumes are bad for them!” Pet Shop Lady says. 

  


“So, you have veterinary documents for their health issues?” May asks. 

  


“I don’t sell animals with health issues!” Pet Shop Lady says, affronted. 

  


“Ah, so you put them down.” May says. “Do you have the reports on hand, or does Millie still have them down in the morgue?”

  


“That’s disgusting!” Pet Shop Lady says. “My animals are all in excellent health, I don’t need to have them euthanized.”

  


“So, there is literally no problem here aside from you don’t like the way it smells.” May says. 

  


“I’m allergic to-” Pet Shop Lady starts. 

  


“Stop.” May says. “If you’re having medical issues, go to the hospital. Otherwise, deal with it.”

  


May turns to Tea Shop Lady. “Do you have anything in there that would hurt her animals?” 

  


“I suppose coffee isn’t good for them.” Tea Shop Lady says. “But it’s never hurt any of mine.”

  


“No peppermint oil or anything?” May asks. 

  


“The Marasats don’t like it.” Tea Shop Lady says. 

  


“You burn incense?” May asks. 

  


“Certainly not.” Tea Shop Lady says. 

  


“Ok, I’m gonna give the two of you a choice. There’s an empty store two blocks down. Either you figure out how to get along here, or one of you is moving. I’m gonna give you a few days to decide between yourselves, but if I hear anything else about this I’m gonna flip a coin and the loser relocates. You don’t like that, I’m gonna ticket both of you for disorderly.” 

  


The women grudgingly go back into their respective businesses. The crowd seems to agree overall with the tea shop owner, some follow her but none of them go into the pet store. A drone that had been circling flies away in search of something else interesting. 

  


They get called over to the commercial shuttle area, where May has to explain that a llama is not “carry on” and would at the very least need it’s own ticket. Then to deck 9, where Kevin and Brittany are duking it out yet again. 

  


“Holy fuck, you guys, just get a divorce!” May shouts as she and Rahal approach. 

  


This place is supposed to look like a subdivision, which means the houses have individual roofs with the ceiling above them. The video panels here are showing an actual sky right now, a red sunset with golden clouds. Brittany is on the roof, looking very dramatic against the backdrop. 

  


“Look, baby, I told you, I didn’t let her borrow it, she-” Kevin dodges a shoe. “Stole it.”

  


“Who stole what?” May asks. 

  


“Monica took my Roamer.” Kevin says. 

  


“Did you file a report?” May asks. 

  


“Not yet, it just happened like thirty minutes ago. That’s why I’m late.” He raises his voice and directs the last part at Brittany. 

  


“ISTC dispatch, we have a report of an accident. Ship has impacted the station in quadrant 847, no injuries reported. Pilot appears intoxicated.” The voice comes in through May and Rahal’s radios. 

  


May puts a finger against her ear, a visual cue that she’s activated her radio and isn’t talking at nothing. “Dispatch, can you give me the make and model of that ship and the driver’s name?” 

  


“DelMade Roamer, model f38. Pilot is Monica Fremmel.” Dispatch responds. 

  


“Well, she just crashed your ship.” May says to Kevin. 

  


“Shit, no! I just paid it off!” Kevin wails. 

  


“Put in a claim with ISTC. They’ll cover stolen vehicles here.” May says. “You can probably get a pretty decent payout if you include pain and suffering. I’ll say you and Brittany both appear distressed.” 

  


Brittany climbs down from the roof and comes up to comfort her husband. They go back into the house together, May makes a rude hand gesture after they’ve closed the door. 

  


“You ever just want to smack someone?” May asks. 

  


“All the time.” Rahal says. “Don’t you get tired of this?”

  


May shrugs. “It’s not all I do, you know.”

  


“Yeah, you sit around and watch security video and read passenger manifests and shit.” Rahal says. 

  


“Yep.” May says. “I am a nosy bitch.”

  


“Are you, like, investigating Dusty or something?” Rahal asks. “Did he do something?”



“No.” May says. “Well, ISTC doesn’t give a shit about him, anyway, he’s a little janky sometimes but not like that. Maybe if he was, like, seriously interstellar, but just here and the surface? Nah, just the normal shit.”

  


“So, you’re just watching videos and stuff for entertainment? I thought you didn’t like their music.” Rahal says. 

  


“I didn’t say that.” May says. “Their music is fine.”

  


“You like it.” Rahal says. 

  


“Fine, yes, are you happy now?” May rolls her eyes. 

  


She does actually like the music, that’s true. And she does like watching him on stage, they put on a good show. But now, Falcron seems to keep nudging him into her awareness again, band posters on the walls, music in a random store, reminding her to talk to the dancers at a time when she wouldn’t be able to help but see him in Mango. There’s also the matter of those sky rats that also seem to be infesting his home and apparently following him around.

1q0ufpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q0ufpw/aitah_for_climbing_a_mountain_instead_of_being/,AITAH for climbing a mountain instead of being with my girlfriend.,"I (M 32) have been with my girlfriend (F 27) for just over a year. From the very beginning of our relationship, she knew that climbing was a huge part of my life. About a month after we started dating, I went to Nepal to attempt Everest Base Camp, which I considered my first “real” climb. She initially mentioned coming, but it wasn’t a question of ability my expedition was already fully booked. These trips are planned months in advance.



About 5–6 months ago, I mentioned I wanted to climb Kilimanjaro. At first, she seemed mostly indifferent but still supportive. One night though, she was quiet and clearly upset. I asked her to talk to me, and she admitted she felt left out and that I spent a lot of my free time training, climbing, or hiking with friends.



So I invited her to come hiking with us.



She initially declined, then changed her mind. We bought her some basic climbing gear, and over the next few weeks, she actually did really well. She came on hikes regularly, bonded with some of my friends’ partners, and genuinely seemed to enjoy it. Things felt really good between us.



Then one day, after a climb, we were all sitting around having coffee and talking about our upcoming Kilimanjaro trip. One of my friend’s partners casually asked her, “Oh, you’re coming too, right?”



The silence was deafening.



She looked straight at me. The kind of look that says “Well?” And instead of being honest in that moment, I panicked. I didn’t want to embarrass her in front of everyone. So I said, “Yeah, of course.”



Everyone got excited, and we went home shortly after.



On the drive home, she was buzzing. Meanwhile, my stomach was in knots. The route we had planned, the Umbwe Route is not beginner-friendly. It’s steep, technical, and fast (5–6 days vs. 9–10 for beginner routes). For her to have the best chance, the entire group of 13 people would’ve had to switch to a longer, easier route. I already knew that wouldn’t happen.



Later that night, I sat her down and explained everything. That Kilimanjaro isn’t “easy,” that she’d only been training for a few weeks, and that while it was doable, it would take serious commitment, training, conditioning, even diet.



She said she was all in.



So we trained. Harder hikes. Actual climbing. Multi-day hikes with overnight camps and sunrise summits. And honestly… I’ve never been more in love with her before. Watching her push herself, seeing her determination. It was incredible. I supported her completely.



I even bought an engagement ring. I planned to propose on the summit of KJ.



Before the trip, I had a serious conversation with her. I told her she might not summit, not because she wasn’t capable, but because altitude sickness, injury, or exhaustion are real risks. I promised that if she couldn’t continue, I’d come back with her and we’d try again another time.



Then she asked me something I didn’t expect:



“If that happens… would you still summit without me?”



I hesitated, but I was honest. I said yes that this climb meant a lot to me. She told me she understood and didn’t want me to resent her or miss out on a lifelong goal.



We took the Umbwe Route.



After the first day, she was completely exhausted. The altitude was hitting her hard. She had shin splints. I could see her fighting tears, but she pushed on. The entire group rallied around her cheering her on, motivating her. Everyone genuinely wanted her to succeed.



That night, one of the guides pulled me aside with two friends and one of their partners. They were concerned for her safety. We were only one day up, and medically, this was the best time for her to descend. Continuing with shin splints could cause fractures.



I got defensive. I said she’d be devastated and that I believed in her.



The guide calmly said it was her decision but that I should talk to her.



When I did, everything exploded.



She accused me of always doubting her. Said she’d finish the climb just to prove me wrong. Then she rolled over and didn’t say another word.



The next morning, she was up before everyone dressed, ready to go. Even the guide was impressed.



We climbed less than 2km when I heard a scream that made my blood run cold.



She was sitting on the ground, sobbing. The pain from her shin splints had spread to her feet, especially her arches. She couldn’t go on.



I told her it was okay. Everyone surrounded her, hugged her, told her how proud they were. We agreed we’d come back and do it together another time.



Two of my friends and I helped her descend to camp, where she’d be escorted back to the base and then to a hotel.



I kissed her goodbye and said, “I’ll see you in a couple of days. Rest up.”



Her face dropped.



“So you’re just leaving me alone in a hotel room?”



I reminded her of our conversation where she said she was okay with me continuing.



She said she only said that because she didn’t think it would actually happen. That it was either her or the climb.



At that point… something broke in me. It wasn’t about choosing a mountain over her. It was about her telling me what she thought I wanted to hear and then changing it once reality hit.



So I told her I loved her. I apologized. And I said I had to finish the climb.



At the summit, everyone celebrated.



I cried.



I stood there holding the engagement ring I planned to give her, realizing exactly what I’d lost.



She never answered my calls or texts.



When we got back, she was gone. She blocked me everywhere. As far as I know, we’re done.



I lost the love of my life over a giant rock that wasn’t going anywhere.



Now I don’t even want to climb anymore. Every hike just reminds me of her.

Being 33 I am starting to dread the daunting task of staying up all the way until midnight for new years. This year I thought I could just drink coffee along with my alcohol to get me over the finish line. I don't normally drink coffee. We arrived at my friend's house at around 6pm. Already yawning and a few drinks deep, I asked my friend for a coffee. He asked if an espresso was fine and I said yes. At around 8pm, I felt more awake but thought one more would really perk me up, so I had another one. At around 11pm, caught up in the excitement of the night, I thought one more would see me over the finish line and the car ride home (girlfriend driving) and into a nice sleep at around 1:30am after getting home and showering. It is now 2pm AEST and I am still wide awake. I wish I was joking. I have been awake since 7am on Tuesday. That is 49 hours. I am wide awake now and probably won't sleep until tonight (another 8 hours or so).

It shimmered high above the city, glowing with impossible colors as the super mutant X-gene known as **the Catalyst** continued to evolve—its fragments spreading across the world, rewriting the rules of biology, physics, and destiny itself.

And somewhere beyond the horizon, moving faster than sound, faster than thought…

**Daniyah Daniels was disappearing.**

# Chapter One: Beyond the Horizon

Central City’s skyline trembled.

Windows rattled. Sirens wailed. The air itself screamed as a blue-and-silver streak tore through the streets, curving around buildings, vanishing and reappearing like lightning given purpose.

Inside that streak was **Dash Dynamo**—the hero once known as the fastest being alive.

But not anymore.

Daniyah felt it first in her chest.

*Something’s wrong… or right.*

Her heart pounded—not from exertion, but from *expansion*. The world slowed until raindrops hung frozen in midair, glistening like diamonds.

She skidded to a halt on the edge of the harbor, sneakers smoking.

“No,” she whispered. “I didn’t slow down.”

She looked around.

The world had failed to keep up with **her**.

Her comm crackled to life.

“Dash, you okay?” a familiar voice asked. **Monica Rambeau**, hovering above the bay in a glow of photon energy. “You vanished from every sensor. Even Stark’s satellites lost you.”

Daniyah blinked.

“I didn’t vanish,” she said slowly. “I… outran them.”

# Chapter Two: The Feather Awakens

That night, Daniyah couldn’t sleep.

Every time she closed her eyes, she *moved*.

Not physically—but mentally—slipping forward, backward, sideways through moments she hadn’t lived yet.

She bolted upright in bed, gasping.

Her room shimmered.

Then fractured.

Suddenly, she was standing in the same room—but older. Her suit lay folded on a chair nearby, redesigned, glowing faintly blue.

A mirror caught her attention.

Her reflection smiled before she did.

“You finally caught up,” the future Daniyah said.

Daniyah stumbled back. “Okay. Nope. This is new.”

Future Daniyah crossed her arms. “The Catalyst feather didn’t just make you faster. It removed your speed limit.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means velocity no longer applies to you the way it does to everyone else.”

A pause.

Then softly: “You’re faster than light now.”

The room snapped back to normal.

Daniyah collapsed onto her bed, breathing hard.

“Faster than light…” she whispered.

# Chapter Three: The Accelerator Is Born

Two days later, deep beneath Avengers Tower, Daniyah stood inside a Stark-designed containment chamber.

Tony Stark’s hologram flickered to life.

“Kid,” Tony said, rubbing his temples, “you broke causality. Do you have *any* idea how annoying that is to explain on a whiteboard?”

Bruce Banner adjusted his glasses, staring at the readouts. “She isn’t just moving fast. She’s phasing through time itself.”

Monica hovered nearby. “You mean like the Blur?”

Bruce shook his head. “No. The Blur bends time.”

He looked at Daniyah.

“She outruns it.”

Daniyah clenched her fists. “So what am I supposed to do? Stop running?”

Tony laughed humorlessly. “That ship sailed when you crossed three centuries and came back before my coffee cooled.”

Daniyah took a breath.

“I need a new suit.”

Hours later, she stepped out wearing it.

A sleek, radiant blue suit traced with living energy lines, humming softly like a restrained storm. The emblem on her chest resembled a streak splitting a star.

Tony whistled. “Well, damn. You look like physics filed a restraining order.”

Daniyah smiled.

“I’m not Dash Dynamo anymore.”

She pulled on her mask.

“I’m **The Accelerator**.”

# Chapter Four: Faster Than Light

Her first test wasn’t planned.

A cosmic rupture tore open above Earth—a fracture caused by Catalyst instability, threatening to erase an entire city before the Avengers could respond.

Doctor Strange opened a portal, urgency in his voice. “The collapse will happen in three seconds!”

Daniyah stepped forward.

“No,” she said calmly. “It won’t.”

She ran.

Not across space—

But *through time*.

She passed photons frozen like glass. She passed sound waves still waiting to be born. She outran the explosion before it existed, reaching the fracture at the exact moment it *decided* to happen.

She touched it.

And kept running.

The rupture unraveled behind her, undone before it could be real.

She skidded to a stop back beside the Avengers.

Only a fraction of a second had passed.

Thor stared at her, stunned. “By the stars… she moved before the moment.”

Doctor Strange lowered his hands slowly. “She didn’t just save us.”

“She edited reality.”

# Chapter Five: The Fastest Being Alive

Later, on a quiet rooftop, Daniyah stood alone, watching the city glow.

Monica landed beside her.

“You okay?” she asked.

Daniyah nodded. “I think so. It’s just… everything feels slow now.”

Monica smiled softly. “That doesn’t mean you have to leave us behind.”

Daniyah looked at her hands, crackling faintly with blue light.

“I can hear tomorrow coming,” she said. “I can see yesterday fading. But I choose *now*.”

She turned, determination blazing.

“Ready,” she said.

A pause.

“Set.”

The air vibrated.

“**Accelerate.**”

She vanished in a flash of blue light, streaking across the sky—past satellites, past stars, past the very edge of known speed.

And somewhere in the vast tapestry of time, legends began to change.

Because now—

She was faster than The Blur.  
Faster than light.  
Faster than destiny itself.

1q0uaoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishLearning/comments/1q0uaoe/daily_studying_routine/,Daily studying routine?,"Hello,

I just decided to start learning Spanish. I was going to learn French but ultimately chose to go back to Spanish after realizing I was a lot more comfortable with the language and I liked speaking it. I would like to establish a daily studying routine that will get me to (maybe) A2 by the end of the year. I can have incredibly basic interactions, but I would still classify myself as pre-A1. My goal was B2 by the end of 2028 but I was told it wasn’t possible unless I studied a very long time every day? I thought it was an achievable goal, but let me know what you guys think.

Here are things I would like to incorporate into a daily studying routine:

\- Spanish YouTube videos and/or podcasts (podcasts once I understand more… except, like, coffee break Spanish since they speak English too)

\- A Spanish workbook (I’m planning on picking one up at a store tomorrow or soon)

\- A language learning app (preferably free, I’m still deciding if I want to pay for an app subscription)

\- Potentially other things people recommend I add

I still have classes, other hobbies & spend a lot of time with my recently adopted puppy. I have some time to dedicate to studying but I don’t want to go too over the top since I’m someone who gets burnt out easily.

Any advice would be helpful! I’m new to this and only have experience in 2 classes of public school Spanish which I didn’t retain much from. Thank you! feliz año nuevo!",1,1767236986.0,SpanishLearning,2,1.0,False

1q0u92u,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/1q0u92u/does_this_seem_like_a_twin_flame_connection/,Does this seem like a twin flame connection?,"2.5 years ago a new person joined my company. I was curious to meet him because his CV was astonishing: elite schools, perfect grades and test scores, top-tier companies. On his first day, he surprised me by coming to my office to introduce himself. I was even more surprised that he is exactly my physical type. He was very guarded and stoic, shook my hand, said a few pleasantries, and quickly left. I was really struck by him. He immediately got under my skin even from the brief interaction. I felt so much energy pass between us when he shook my hand that I felt physically uncomfortable. 

After that, he actively avoided me for 2.5 years. If we entered a stairwell together, he’d hold the door, I’d say thank you, and he’d say nothing and bolt down the stairs. If the only open seat in a meeting was next to me, he’d stand on the other side of the room. He never once said hello to me, even at social events. I eventually took offense and assumed he was an elitist or a racist (I'm not white). But he would speak to the other staff, which includes minorities, just never me. If we ever were accidentally close to each other, I would feel that same destabilizing strong energy.

For context, in our industry it’s heavily frowned upon for people in his role and people in mine to date. He’s senior, so there are serious ethical and reputational risks for him. This comes into play later.

This December, two things happened in rapid succession that changed everything. My boss called me the day after a meeting and said ""is something going on between you and [his name]"" and I said ""wtf I don't exist to him, how can you ask me that??"" And she said she saw him staring at me throughout the whole meeting. That was the first moment it clicked that he is attracted to me and had avoided me because he didn't want to cross a line at work.

Then we had our annual holiday party, and towards the end, he finally approached me!!! I was so shocked I don't remember what he said. I came back online when I realized he was laughing and I was teasing him about blocking me in the group photo and suggesting he make his hair even taller for next year to better block people. The look on his face was pure joy. I had never seen him genuinely smile or laugh before at work (I don't think anyone has, and he has a reputation for being an ice man). The chemistry felt electric and oddly familiar, like we’d known each other for years. Later I marvelled that I teased an executive about his HAIR in our first real conversation.

Since then, we’ve met one-on-one under a flimsy work pretext that I suggested, which he enthusiastically agreed to. He then created another excuse to meet privately again. We've been getting to know each other that way, and the vibe feels so good. The attraction is 11/10 on all levels, physically, emotionally, and energetically. It's like we were instant friends. I understand his heart so easily that it surprises both of us, but he does the same for me and understands all my implications and unspoken signals. We've now scheduled another meeting, and his email wording has shifted from work-focused to “let’s definitely chat soon over coffee!""

Despite how nice this feels, it doesn’t feel simple. He’s brilliant but complicated. He’s in a senior role at my company and also on the C-suite of his own (he alternates every other week). He’s an extreme workaholic, sleeps very little, and hasn’t had a partner in years. I suspect he has avoidant attachment. My life has been more focused on my inner world and spirituality. I do well professionally, but I’m not in the same universe of material achievement as him. He’s very cautious about optics and is moving very slowly.

Just because baristas are baristas does not mean they are NPCs you get to treat badly and disrespectfully. If you see over 20 people in the store and still choose to place an order, it is likely that you will have to wait over 15 minutes, and you can’t bother us after 9 (true story) because “it’s taking forever”. 

Today while I was taking a family, this old lady with her hands full of coffee bags starts heckling me and the barista on ovens behind me and going “HELLO HELLO HELLO” in this rude voice until we confirmed that the stupid coffee was 50% off. It’s not only disrespectful to me, but also the family ordering before her, and it really wouldn’t kill her to wait an extra minute.

Anyway back to the topic. Excuse me, I’ve worked 8 hours today and I’m tired.

I hate to say it, but there’s no ranking system in Starbucks. Your order isn’t prioritized because you have a baby with you, or because you’re the wife to a CEO or the president or something. In Starbucks, the only “ranking” that exists is the order in which you’ve placed your order, so please respect that chain coffee shops often include waiting periods and that it is often not the fault of the baristas if you have to wait 10+ minutes.",6,1767236143.0,starbucks,3,0.69,False

I’m looking for perspective, especially from men around my age (late 20s / early 30s), ideally based in the US or Arizona.

I’m currently visiting Arizona for about three weeks. I’m Latino, fit, well-groomed, and fairly social. People often tell me I look good, and in person I usually don’t struggle starting conversations. I dance (bachata/salsa), which also helps in social settings.

I meet women both in real life (dance socials) and through dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Badoo, and Facebook Dating.

The confusing part is the pattern I keep experiencing.

It usually goes like this:

	•	Good conversation and clear interest (in person or via apps)

	•	We exchange Instagram or Snapchat

	•	Sometimes we even discuss concrete plans (gym, coffee, dancing, practicing together)

	•	Then suddenly… no response / ghosting

This has happened multiple times, including with women who seemed genuinely engaged and responsive at first. No arguments, no pressure, no awkward moments that I’m aware of — just sudden disengagement.

I’m not angry or blaming women. I’m genuinely trying to understand the dating landscape here.

So I’m wondering:

	•	Is this kind of ghosting and lack of follow-through just normal dating culture in the US right now?

	•	Is the dating market especially competitive or saturated?

	•	Does being a short-term visitor automatically lower interest, even if the connection is good?

	•	Or is there something subtle I might be doing wrong culturally or socially?

I’d really appreciate hearing from other men — locals or visitors — who’ve experienced something similar, especially those who do relatively well initially but struggle with consistency afterward.

1q0tthf,https://i.redd.it/mnz80rkyhnag1.jpeg,Average guest hunger/thirst above 65%,"On the “Building the Bifrost” level, anyone have any tips on how to get the average thirst to 66%?

I finally got hunger done. I had food shops, stands & vending machines everywhere. I added as many menu extras as I could. I feel like the key for me was making restaurants in the 4 main areas of my park.

I can’t seem to get thirst over 63% no matter how many shops, stands & vending machines I make. Adding ice to my drinks & extra beans (and cumin, gag) to my coffee is not tipping the scales & there’s no restaurant equivalent I can add.

My main thought is that people are getting thirsty while on line at rides (and while traveling between areas) but I don’t actually know how to shorten lines. I guess jacking up the prices on popular rides? Or should I shorten the physical line so people are crowded outside?

There’s also plenty of people that are thirsty but seem to ignore drink shops. I read someone say I should add signs to shops so guests notice them but is this true? How does it work?

I also tried closing the park, waiting for everyone to leave then reopening the park. Everyone came in with 0 thirst but somehow the thirst rating didn’t go up. 

I guess one more thing I can try is razing everything outside of a small area & hoping the area is small enough that people stay satisfied but I’d rather not have to cheese to get results.

1q0tp0f,https://i.redd.it/f1j9moymgnag1.jpeg,whats your favourite e-reader? my collection + thoughts,"I have the Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen, Kobo Clara Colour, and the Boox Palma 2. These are just my thoughts and personal experience using them (also I mainly borrow from Libby or sideload), feel free to share yours too or if you have any other favourite e-readers. 

Kindle PW: For screen quality and overall reading experience, the Kindle wins for me. It’s the most crisp and clear compared to the other two, even with a matte screen protector. Never had too much issue with ghosting, and it’s fantastic for reading during the night using dark mode. Compared to other e-readers, the dark mode has a much deeper black, and creates a sharper contrast with the text. I also appreciate that dark mode is applied across the entire interface, rather than just being limited to when reading. I also think sideloading books is the most efficient on the Kindle IF it’s a suitable format. If it’s manga then the Kobo is much better to sideload with. Battery life is also the best out of them. 

Kobo Clara Colour: As I’m not from America, I can’t use Libby on my Kindle, so using Libby on the Kobo is very convenient. It’s small and lightweight to carry around without feeling too bulky. The colour aspect does spark a bit of joy, however I really only feel like it would be necessary when reading comics or graphic novels. I just think the Kobo Clara is just a weeny bit too small to read comics though. I maybe should have upsized to the Libra Colour instead. The grainy screen wasn’t too much of a bother for me as you do get used to it. Could not apply a matte screen protector as it was getting too blurry for my liking, so I opted for a glass one. I guess I prefer text clarity over glare. 

Boox Palma 2: I feel the most comfortable bringing this one outside with me due to its form factor. Can slip it into a small purse or your pocket. Does take a while to get used to, it took a lot of fiddling around with the settings, but I got there in the end and enjoyed using it. Great for a different range of use cases. I like how I can just plug in some earphones and listen to some ambience/background music while I read on it. I use it for other things too, such as for flashcards or dictionary while I’m studying so I don’t get distracted on my phone. Dark mode is not the best, I’ve not yet found a way so that the text isn’t a bit grainy unless I’m using a bold sans serif font. The Libby app dark mode is especially horrible too. 

In conclusion, I mainly use the Kindle when reading at night, Kobo for reading my library books, and Boox Palma when I go out. I wanted to use my Kobo for comics and manga but I’ve just started using my iPad Mini instead. ",17,1767234892.0,ereader,6,1.0,False

After 12 years together, I thought we would make it and after everything we’d been through together, I was proud of how far we’d come and how much we’d grown together. But I was no competition when her best friend came into her life two years ago.

When it became obvious to me that there was more to it than just friendship and I asked her about it, she always got upset and cried and made me feel like an asshole for questioning their friendship. There’s plenty of context, but I’ve been crying and she just left with more of her stuff to take over there to her friend’s place and I just don’t have it in me to type it all out and I know I’m already going to ramble too much anyway. 

I’m feeling heartbroken. She lied and gaslit me for so long. Made me feel diminished as a person over all the times she made me feel crazy or like I was asking for too much. Like I expected too much and also wasn’t good enough to hold her attention and receive her love. 

She told me she wants to be friends and had the gall to act upset when I said what for? After all that she’s done to me? She’s been having her cake and eating it too and still wants me to be a miserable keychain on her ring of emotional flings. 

Because this isn’t the first time she’s done this to me— the first time was years ago and when we were in our early twenties, and when I didn’t understand what emotional cheating was. But it was still the same. The secrecy, the lying, the being more protective and attuned to that other person than me. 

Things got better after that and we did grow emotionally together, and while I’ve struggled with self worth issues and trusting her with how she viewed and felt about me after numerous instances of her shaking my trust in her, I never thought she would up and do this to me. It probably seems blatant and obvious to a reader, but all of this was strung out over years for me and there were good times in between.

The day before she ended things, I’d spent four hours cleaning the kitchen and reorganizing things, and I’d made it a special project of mine to fix up a cute little coffee bar for her so everything was within reach and looked nice and I remember feeling excited for her to come home and see it. Then she dumps me the next day, two days after Christmas (and after I bought her a bunch of shit) and right before my 31st birthday. 

I just feel so used and betrayed. Like I’m nothing to her and all of the little acts of love I bestowed on her meant nothing. I have so much love to give and it’s got nowhere to go and I’m so fucking sad and lonely. I know it won’t feel so raw after a while but right now it’s very hard. She was my first and only romantic relationship in my life so far, we’d been together since I was 18. I really thought she was my person and I thought she truly loved me enough to keep working on our relationship.

I will be going to therapy later in January and I know just what to start off with in terms of topic of discussion. I really don’t even know why I’m posting this because I don’t ever really engage with the internet as myself, mostly just a viewer, but like I said, I’m just so sad and lonely and I guess I’m looking for advice or reassurance. I don’t have much family and no real friends to lean on. It’s just me and my kitties and as cuddly and sweet as they’ve been, I wish they could also talk to me because it’s so quiet here now. I try to keep busy but reminders of her are everywhere. I’ve been getting sniped by the smallest things and burst into tears over the stupidest things of hers or reminders of things we used to share or do together. 

I’m rambling and this is already too long. I know I’ll be fine in the long run, but it’s pretty fucking scary thinking of moving forward. I can’t currently afford the apartment we’re leasing on my own. We’re stuck in this lease together until next Halloween. I can’t afford to live on my own in my area and while I have a grandfather in town who would absolutely take me in, there isn’t room for me in his house since my brother already lives there. I know I have some time to try and get things figured out, it’s just that the rug’s been pulled out from under me and I’m struggling to be calm about everything that will need to change within the next ten months.

Keeping it a reasonable length while imbuing it with some of my own personality was challenging (but fun and weirdly therapeutic). If you make it to the end and feel inclined to message me, tell me how I did. If you take one look at the length and think, *Fuck this*, I don't blame you.

My 2025 was crazy. I spent the first half of the year planning (and ***stressing*** about) a move from Maryland to Washington, then spent the second half of the year basically starting over. Thankfully, I have an amazing and supportive family, who kept me sane throughout it all. I’ve also been lucky enough to make some new friends along the way. (Working with awesome people helps a lot, too.) I feel more or less settled now with a pretty good idea of what I want to do with my 2026, and would love to share some of my free time with someone who’s interested in potentially building something together.

I’m looking for someone I make time to see and who makes time for me on a regular basis because we enjoy each other’s company. Ultimately, I would like to end up with a partner I live with, but that comes from trust that builds over time, so I’m in no hurry. Mutual attraction and chemistry is a great place to start, though. So let’s chat and see if it leads to meeting for coffee or dinner. If we get that far, we can figure out what comes next.

I currently work in Seattle and reside in Tukwila, but I will be moving to Fircrest next summer to live with my family while I go to UW for my master’s in psychology. I don’t mind a nice drive with some good tunes, though, so I’m cool with travelling up to \~60 minutes. (I'm not opposed to longer, but that's obviously something we would have to figure out for anything long-term.)

I've been divorced for four years. My ex and I were young and dumb with a lot of unresolved personal issues that carried over into our relationship and eventually destroyed us. It sucked, but I learned a lot and grew from it. I’ve been in several “situationships” since then, but nothing serious or committed. They were all awesome women I feel lucky to have known, but they either weren't good fits or right place, wrong time.

I’m pretty introverted, but I come out of my shell easily around people I vibe with. I’m quiet, patient, and chill with a passionate streak that burns hot sometimes. (Think The Dude mixed with Hunter S. Thompson with a dash of Rust Cohle, but boring and less handsome.) For those who know/care, my love languages are quality time, words of affirmation, and acts of service.

I am a humanist, and I strongly believe in both human and individual rights, as well as body autonomy. It feels weird to have to declare that, but we live in weird times. I don't know what ideology best lines up with my weird-ass worldview, but I feel pretty safe calling myself a leftist. I If I had my way, we would live in the Star Trek future where money doesn't exist and everyone is free to express themselves however they see fit. For now, though, I’m resigned to voting for Democrats to stave off the descent into conservative totalitarian hellholism for as long as possible. I’m not religious and I’m generally not a fan of religious institutions, but I’ve known plenty of cool religious folks.

I like animals and they like me. Working with mice, rats, guinea pigs, African Thicket rats, ferrets, chickens, ducks, hamsters, woodchucks, and monkeys for 15 years has taught me a thing or two about animal behavior and care. I have a cat named Chani, and I adore her. (If you correctly guess who she’s named after, first coffee/dinner is on me if/when we ever meet.)

Cooking is my favorite hobby. Whether it’s on the stovetop, in the oven, or in a crock pot, I’ll make you something delicious. I love cooking for my friends and family, so if we end up dating, I will definitely cook for you. I also enjoy reading, writing, gaming, discovering used book stores and thrift shops, going to restaurants, hiking/walking, going to the movies (AMC A-List ftw), going to concerts, and chilling with my cat. I'm not a super adventurous guy, but I'm always down to try something new. Seasonal depression chiselled away at my home workout routine, but I’m determined to find new ways to be consistently active and healthy this year.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading, and I hope you have an awesome 2026!

1q0tfnv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0tfnv,"Finally the fuck out of Montgomery, AL...","Woke up yesterday on my favorite kind of onramp. Raised two hundred seventy degree loop. Plenty of trees to hide in. Nice and level. 

Gear packed, I headed for starbucks because I had a gift card someone gave me in Haymarket a while back. It was one of those newer shitty ones that are basically a long couch with some tables in front of it. I say shitty 'cause there's nowhere to charge like the older ones. 

Found a seat at it's own little table. Gear down. Some outlets about six feet away. Plugged my stuff in. Grabbed a small hazelnut latte and a blueberry muffin. Was a little stoked they heated it up. The wind was blowin' outside and it was plenty cold.

Phone and vape charged. Back in their respective pockets. Coffee and muffin finished. Gear up. Out the door.

Across the street. Walked down a little ways to find a spot where cars could easily pull over. Gear down thumb out. 

Maybe fifteen minutes later a white pickup pulls over with an older (than me) couple. Kinda hippiei-sh. My kinda folks. ""We're going about twenty miles up the road."" ""That'll work."" ""Put your stuff in the back and hop in.""

Gear in the back I hop in front. The woman scooted over to the middle to give me a spot to sit. ""At least we'll get you warmed up."" ""That's definitely a help.""

They drop me in Shorter, GA. A gas station and a dollar general were about all there was to the town. A lot of people driving from the gas station to the DG just to look at me and turn back around to go back through the parking lot. 'Probably not a lot of hitchhikers coming through here.😆'

Maybe an hour later I happen to do my no cars ten foot pacing slowly back and forth. Gotta keep the blood flowing. I turn around in the direction I'm headed. I see a truck up at the next break in the median. Dude reverses over across two lanes, onto the shoulder, and down to me. 

Old black guy. ""I can get you up the road about twenty thirty miles."" ""Awesome!"" ""Toss your stuff in the back."" Gear in the back of his truck I get in. ""Where you goin'?"" ""Savannah."" ""Savannah... You got peope there?"" ""No."" ""You goin' for work?"" ""I've been traveling the country for thirty-two years."" ""Really? You must have a lot of money then."" I got no money. I just travel, pick up work when I can. Sometimes it's the kindness of strangers."" ""Oh. So you're just travelin' around broke?"" ""For the most part yeah."" ""This is Geneva. I'll drop you at the truck stop up here."" ""That'll be perfect."" 

A few minutes later we pull into a tiny gas station. The only thing that might make it a truck stop is that a couple locals park their bobtail trucks there. I thank dude, grab my gear out of the back, and give him a wave to signify I've got everything. 

When I put my pack on the tall can of coke u/nstantoatmeal gave me the day before fell out of a water bottle holder pocket. Instantly coke is spraying out of a hole. It was aimed away from me luckily. So I grab it, making sure to not spray me, my gear, or dude's truck, and toss it in a trash can.

Back to my gear. Gear up. Water jug in hand, I head down the 80 to find a spot to hitchhike. About a thousand feet down I hit the end of town. Across the street from a babtist church.

I got there a little after 2:30pm. It's cold. The wind is howling. My ear that was on the shady side started to hurt. I put my coat on over my hoody. Gloves on. 'That's better.'

An hour in the cold is sapping my energy. My bones are starting to hurt. I've got both hoods up. People can barely see what I look like. 'I don't care. They're either gonna stop or they're not. Every time someone told me they don't pick up hitchhikers if they're doing or not doing X-thing they were just looking for excuses not to be kind.'

Another hour goes by. I can see there's what used to be a road behind me going up a hill. 'That might be the spot tonight. I hope it's level somewhere up there.'

At this point I'm beat. I haven't had enough calories to be generating much heat. The wind is still blowing. It's cold and getting colder. I've got about an hour of daylight left. I'm serously connsidering saying 'fuck it' and going to find a spot to put my tent for the night.

But I persevered. Another half hour goes by. A truck pulls over. Gear up. I head over. The passenger window is open. ""Where ya headed?"" ""Savannah."" He nods and says, ""I'll get you most of the way there. I'm going about three hours that direction."" ""Awesome!"" ""Toss your shit in the back."" I do and get in. ""Do you smoke?"" ""Yeah."" ""Just crack a window."" ""Cool."" 

He offers me a cigarette that I gladly take. I'm down to about eight bucks that's gonna be dinner when I land for the night. Definitely wasn't gonna blow my last few bucks on smokes when I've got a vape in my pocket.

Him, ""You look like an old construction hand in that coat."" ""I spent about fifteen years as a carpenter."" ""I'm sorry."" I laugh. 

Dude's a pipe fitter. We chatted a little bit, but he didn't seem overly eager for conversation. Fine by me. It's late. I'm tired. Some brief conversation throughout the ride but nothing more than where he was gonna drop me off. He got a little talkative about his life the last few years as we got close.

I get dropped just north of Aline, GA. It's dark. There's a cheveron, a bp, an animal safari, and a bunch of farm land. Dude tosses me half a pack of cigarettes. ""Here brother."" ""Thanks man!""

Gear up. Across the highway. I checked maps to see where a good spot is. Found the semi-frequent mowed cut that I see out back of a lot of truck stops. I head for that. A car comes down it. Turns out there's a few shacks/houses back there.

I head for the other side of the parking lot. Get close to the trees. Behind a semi to look for a spot to tuck into. Squish. Squish. 'Fuck. Is that mud? Yep.' The damage wasn't bad. Only came up over the toe of my right shoe.

No way into the trees there. I head back across the mud, being careful to find dry ground this time. Over to a little ways in front of the road/shortcut. 'Are those pine trees? They are? Sweet!' I know theres spaces in between pine trees. 

I head in. Find a decent spot. Drop my gear. Investigate a spot nearby. It's a little flatter and there's more cover between me and the gas station across the dirt lot.

Tent up. Gear in. Me in. Bed made.I double check the $8 I've got. Out of the tent. Back across the street to the other gas station. I'd spied a Hunts Brothers Pizza sign when I got dropped off there. 'Hopefully I've got enough for pizza and an orange soda.' 

I nixed the soda for two slices of pizza. I figured I needed calories for a twenty-seven degree night, and I had plenty of water.

Pizza slices in hand I head back across the highway to camp. Back in the tent I scarf down pizza. Lit one of the smokes dude gave me. Broke out the one-hitter. 'It's amazing those two buds I brought from Haymarket are still going.' A little reddit. 

My phone battery is getting low. Battery bank is dead. I opted to charge the vape earlier that day instead. I kick a movie on and pass out.

Woke up rhis morning at 6:30ish. Check the weather. Twenty-seven. 'Nope.' Snuggked back down into my mummy bag. Ran my phone down to nine percent screwing around until I fell back asleep.

Woke back up around 10:30. I can feel by the cold air I'm breathing that it's above freezing. Time to get moving.

Smoke. Gear packed. Twelve-volt charger and cable in my coat pocket. 'I can probably get someone to let me charge while we're moving down the road.'

Out of the tent. Tent on pack. Gear up. Water bottle. Pizza boxes stuffed with trash. Out of the woods. Over to the gas station trash cans. Pizza boxes deposited. Out to the ramp.

I come up on the ramp. As I turn to go down a little bit I see eight cop cars. Two rows of four. About halfway down the ramp on the side.

'I'm not wanted and I'm not doing anything illegal.' I head for a good spot down the ramp. Gear down. Thumb out.

'I bet these guys don't have shit to do and are probably meeting up for lunch.' It's 12:38 when I set my gear down. 'I bet they'll be gone by 1:00. I guess I can't break the one-hitter out. 😆😆😆'

Surprisingly decent amount of cars coming down this onramp. Slow, but steady. Of course everybody's slowing down because of the cops. Definitely not picking up a hitchhiker either. 😆

Sure enough the cops start taking off one at a a time. By 1:00 they're gone.

A car pulls over. ""Where ya going?"" ""Savannah."" ""I'm going to Pooler."" ""Cool"" ""Throw your stuff in the back seat. Just don't murder me."" ""Nah, I do all my axe-murdering in the morning."" He laughs. ""I appreciate that."" 

Gear in the back seat I get in. Him, ""Where am I going?"" Slight pause from me, *I'm* going to Savannah."" ""Cool.""

We had one of the best conversations about religion and spirituality I've ever had. We believe different things, but it was really open and honest. Neither of us was trying to convince the other of anything. Just putting our views out there.

He took me all the way to Savannah. Dropped me on Bay Street. Tossed me some cash. I grab my gear, thank him profusely. Gear on the sidewalk I start to refamiliarise myself with savannah. It's been about four years since I've been here. It all came back pretty quick.

Feeds re-located I head for Bay St Liquor for a cheap pack of smokes. ""I don't have change."" ""Alright..."" Out of there. Up to the squares. Down towards Broad St. I took a break about halfway.

Made it to a feed. (I hadn't eaten yet today.) Black beans and rice, a piece of chicken, bread, raisins (fuck raisins), and a ham and cheese sandwich that had been warmed by the rest of the meal in a to-go box. 'Delicious!'

I can see another place I know serves and is killer. Great food. I ask some homebums what time it serves. ""5:30."" ""Thanks!"" I head that way. Find a spot in the sun out of the wind. Cigarette. A dude comes walking up. I say hi. He tells me there's a sign that says they aren't serving due to new years eve and sits down on the curb a ways from me.

""Do you want some mints?"" He holds up a grocery bag full. ""Nah. I'm good."" How about some donuts?"" ""Sure."" He pulls a pack of donuts out of his pocket. ""I'll tell you what. If you let me hit that vape I'll give you these donuts."" I'm not real keen  on sharing a vape with someone I don't know. 

Me, ""Do you want a cigarette?"" ""Yeah!"" he says enthusiastically. I hand him my last cigarette. He hands me the donuts. 'Sweet. Got a meal earlier, and even got dessert.'

We chat for a bit. The sun is setting. I go read the sign on the door of this place. Come back. Grab my gear. ""Alright man, I'm gonna go find a spot to camp. We both go our separate ways. 

I roll down to my old spot from four years ago. There's a well-worn trail leading to it. I followed it until I saw a camp with a few tents. Prompt one-eighty. Get the fuck out of there. Found a spot somewhere else where I had to bushwack through two tree lines to get there. Stealth times two. 'Perfect.'

Gear down. Weeds and such stomped down. Tent up. Gear in. Me in. Realized I spaced my headphones somewhere. 'Bummer.' Bed made. Chargers, etc. in small day pack. Out of tent.

Back down town. Public bathroom. Slyly walk into mcdonalds, find an outlet. Been sitting here typing this ever since.

1q0tcve,https://www.reddit.com/r/returnToIndia/comments/1q0tcve/moving_back_to_india_has_been_a_mixed_bag_but/,"Moving back to India has been a mixed bag, but better overall than staying in the US, given the current political climate in America.","I lived, studied and worked in USA for 10 years in cities like Boston, San Francisco and Chicago. I enjoyed my time in America. I endured the harsh Boston and Chicago winters for 10 years. Education and work culture are traditionally both of high quality in the US, and I am grateful to have earned 2 MS degrees in data science and operations research from reputed US universities. Last year, I had to move back to India due to a company wide layoff affecting 250+ employees. The company had filed for my green card earlier and the layoff happened at the worst possible time for me with my 6 years of H-1B visa expiring.

I was dejected and devastated that after 10 years, I had to return to India. Its been over a year here, and yes, the transition has been hard. In America, I got used to clean streets, clean air, world class infrastructure and an efficient local system which made the basic amenities in life achievable for the common man or woman. Yes, India has serious issues, like poor AQI in most of the big cities, traffic snarls due to exploding population, white dust everywhere, lack of civic sense – public urination, lack of driving sense in people – people driving on the wrong side, not following rules etc.

But after a year of being back home, I also realized that:

1. *I have not faced a single incident of hate crime because of my race.* In America, I faced about 8 such distressing incidents in 10 years.
2. *I don’t have to fear being mugged or shot dead if I stay out late at night.* These are serious problems in Chicago.
3. I can call my doctors on the phone and there is a very good chance that they will pick up and talk to me without fixing an appointment. *This was impossible in America.*
4. In USA, I developed symptoms of schizoaffective disorder and borderline personality disorder (BPD). 1 year after returning to India, my schizoaffective disorder is now officially diagnosed as being in remission, with no hallucinations or delusions. My BPD is also showing signs of improvement, and what I struggle currently is with mood instability and challenges with distress tolerance.
5. Boston and Chicago have severely cold winters. Temperatures can easily go below -20 degrees C in peak winter months, and the sun does not show itself for many months. This causes a common vitamin deficiency and also brings about depression and anxiety due to constantly being exposed to below freezing, cloudy climates. In India, the climate is much better than Chicago. I am currently working in Bangalore, where the climate is pleasant, cold in winters but not brutal like Chicago or Boston. I am grateful for that.
6. I am 35, my mom is 59 and my dad is 67. For my mental health diagnosis, I need family support until I get to better health and until my condition improves with time. In USA, my dad was often subjected to secondary screening while entering the country to spend time with me. I am grateful that I left America before the current administration got elected. There has been a lot of stress for H-1B visa holders and F-1 visa holders recently. I do feel for those navigating that stress and uncertainty, and I am grateful to God for not being subject to it right now.
7. I have a great job in India right now, in a global product based MNC, which pays me a highly competitive salary by Indian standards at the market level for my job title and industry. Product companies in India value high quality US experience and education. I am thankful to God that I was able to land Senior Manager level roles in India.
8. I live in one of Bangalore’s better gated communities. I live just 15 min away from my office (by walk), and I am also close to Bangalore Airport. The locality where I live is clean with good infrastructure (malls, restaurants etc.). So commute is not an issue and I do not have to worry much about Bangalore traffic. I also have hired a maid and a cook who help with food and keeping the apartment clean. There is no way that I would be able to have access to all these at such a cheap price anywhere in USA.
9. I lost 15 kg in 1 year through just cutting out excess coffee and sugar. As a programmer, I had gotten used to the extra large coffee sizes in USA. As a vegetarian, I missed the quality of good India food in America. There is just a different taste of eating homemade Indian food which is simply non existent in USA.
10. India is my country. I am a Indian citizen. I do not have to worry about getting a new job in 60 days and I do not have to worry about secondary screening whenever I enter my country.
11. The best part is that I see my family every day. The emotional support and bonding we have is wonderful. My health is better here. I am happier and much more stable than I was in USA.

So, when I look at all the pros and cons, I would choose India over USA right now. I am grateful for how things turned out in my life last year. Being laid off was the best thing that ever happened to me.

I hope this is useful to those who are considering returning to India. USA isn’t as perfect as people say it is, and India isn’t as bad as you think. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. Of course, its all subjective and depends on what suits you best. But be sure to make an objective decision, after writing down and analyzing all the pros and cons.

As a humble employee of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, I stand before you today to say a few words about this… unforgettable… year. A year that treated government workers with all the tenderness of a malfunctioning office printer grinding up a 47‑page application and then blinking “Paper Jam” even though there is absolutely no paper jam.

🕯️ In Memoriam: 2025
2025 began with promise—like a fresh docket with no RCEs in sight. And then, as always, reality arrived with a coffee stain and a passive‑aggressive Post‑it note.

⚖️ What 2025 Did to Government Employees
Let us remember the trials and tribulations it bestowed upon us:

Hiring freezes so icy they made Antarctica look balmy. Nothing says “we value you” like being told your department must do the work of 12 people with a team of 3 and a half (the half being the intern who only works Tuesdays).

Budget cuts so deep they made us wonder if the government was trying to patent “morale reduction” as a novel and non‑obvious process.

Mandatory return‑to-office policies that treated commuting like a patriotic duty, even when the HVAC system was either 42°F or 97°F with no known settings in between.

IT outages that lasted long enough for us to contemplate a second career as a lighthouse keeper.

Training modules that insisted we absolutely,  positively cannot use AI, while simultaneously the 10th floor is shoving AI down our throats and swearing, with a straight face and pearls, that we won't be replaced by machines. 

Performance metrics that shifted more often than a provisional application’s claims.

Meetings that could’ve been emails, and emails that could’ve been...nothing at all.

What union? 

And of course, the annual reminder that “your dedication is appreciated,” delivered with all the sincerity of a boilerplate Office Action.  And let's not forget a bonus that says ""f*ck you very much.""

🪦 The Final Days
By December, 2025 was limping along like a patent application that’s been appealed, remanded, appealed again, and then misplaced in the mailroom. We watched it gasp its last breath somewhere between a completely unnecessary and cruel Reduction in Force and a memo announcing “new efficiency initiatives” that somehow made everything less efficient.

And now, as we gather to lay this year to rest, we do so with mixed emotions: relief, exhaustion, and the faint hope that 2026 will at least buy us dinner first.

🌹 Farewell, 2025
You were chaotic. You were relentless.  You took a simple task and made it a 27-step process, just to prove it can't be done efficiently 😂👀.  You were the bureaucratic equivalent of an empty stapler.

But you were ours.
And we survived you—mostly through caffeine, dark humor, and the unshakeable camaraderie of people who know the true meaning of “government resilience.”

May 2026 be kinder. Or at least come with fewer tone deaf ""Director's Musings.""",25,1767233714.0,patentexaminer,7,0.93,False

1q0t8n2,https://i.redd.it/fyxomtvzbnag1.jpeg,Stouffer’s Classic Lasagna + Rosina Beef Meatballs,"This combo is dangerously good. I’ve been eating it for breakfast for two weeks straight now.

I’m from China, so I had actually never tried lasagna before. The only thing I knew about it was that it’s Garfield’s favorite food. Out of curiosity I finally tried it — and instantly got addicted. Then I started wondering what Italian meatballs pasta tasted like, which led to a question:
what if I eat meatballs together with lasagna?

Boom. I’ve been eating this for two weeks in a row and honestly it looks like I can keep going.

What makes this combo even better is that it’s friendly in various ways:

Budget-friendly
I buy the largest size of Stouffer’s lasagna, cut it into portions, and store them in sandwich bags as individual servings. With the added meatballs, each meal costs me around $3 total, which feels insane for how good it is.

Time-friendly
The day before, I move one portion from the freezer to the fridge.
When cooking, I put it on parchment paper in the air fryer at 400°F for 20 minutes.
– Cover with foil for the first 10 minutes
– During that time, I go make a cup of coffee
– Then I remove the foil, add frozen meatballs, and cook for the remaining 10 minutes

Done. Don’t forget to move tomorrow’s portion from the freezer to the fridge before you eat.

Flavor-friendly + nutritionally balanced
I let the meat sauce from the lasagna coat the meatballs — it gives them tons of flavor. The meatballs, in return, add the fat and protein that lasagna is slightly lacking. It also perfectly solves my only complaint about lasagna: there’s never enough meat.

According to the nutrition labels, one serving of this combo has roughly:
	•	~40g protein
	•	~40g carbs
	•	~35g fat

That’s basically a 1:1:1 macro ratio, and only around 600 calories total.

Honestly, I couldn’t ask for more. I’m so satisfied with this combo that it motivated me to write this long post just to recommend it 😄",20,1767233324.0,frozendinners,7,0.89,False
1q0t7vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSpreadContent/comments/1q0t7vt/smart_kitchen_design_integrating_modern/,Smart Kitchen Design: Integrating Modern Technology into Your Culinary Space,"Designing a smart kitchen is more than just adding gadgets—it’s about creating a seamless, efficient, and enjoyable cooking environment that simplifies daily life. With the rapid rise of connected devices and home automation, modern kitchens are evolving into intuitive culinary spaces that feel like something out of the future. And the best part? You don’t need to be a tech wizard to make it happen.

Here’s how smart kitchen design can completely elevate your cooking experience:

**1. Efficiency Meets Innovation**  
Smart appliances and kitchen tools are built for multitasking. From ovens you can preheat with your phone to faucets that dispense exact measurements of water, every device is designed to save you time and eliminate guesswork. Imagine starting your coffee machine from bed or being alerted when your roast is perfectly done—these are the little conveniences that stack up in a big way.

**2. Streamlined Cooking with Voice Control**  
Hands covered in dough? No problem. With voice-controlled assistants, you can set timers, pull up recipes, or control lighting without touching a thing. This hands-free feature not only boosts hygiene but also adds a touch of futuristic charm to your kitchen routine.

**3. Energy & Cost Savings**  
Smart kitchens are also smarter for your wallet. Energy-efficient appliances, lighting automation, and real-time usage tracking help you reduce waste and lower bills. Over time, this adds up to significant savings while reducing your carbon footprint—win-win!

**4. Smarter Storage and Organization**  
Digital inventory systems can help track your pantry items and notify you when staples are running low or nearing expiration. Some setups even suggest recipes based on what you already have at home—so you reduce food waste and skip last-minute grocery runs.

**5. Mood & Aesthetic Upgrades**  
Smart lighting and customizable setups let you change the vibe of your kitchen instantly. Whether you're hosting dinner guests or enjoying a quiet cup of tea, your environment can adapt to match your mood with just a tap or voice command.

In short, a smart kitchen blends functionality with lifestyle. It’s about transforming your space into a place that works *for* you—making cooking, cleaning, and managing your home feel almost effortless.

Ready to upgrade? You don’t need to do it all at once. Start small, integrate gradually, and enjoy the journey of creating a kitchen that truly fits the rhythm of your life.",1,1767233250.0,TheSpreadContent,0,1.0,False

I loved him very much and I fully felt grief for the first time. I wouldn't say it's something I regret, I spent tons of quality time with him but now I feel like I'm paying a heavy price. Part of the reason I took that break was I had various mental health issues of my own from a very stressful time in a big city, and thought being NEET for a while would help me recover, which it did. But still... 

I took my time and just occasionally sent waves of applications after he passed but didn't devote every waking second to it like I should have. I landed a research job but blew it because I felt iffy that it wasn't in my original career field and it was fairly difficult, I just didn't take it seriously enough. All of my work history, already, is just low paid, lab tech type work, and spotty as well with employment gaps I have to explain. Years earlier my parents paid way too much of their savings for a degree at this private engineering school, I wish I could go back in time and explain to myself that even if I could solve and memorize equations out of textbooks, your intelligence might not necessarily translate to building an impressive career.

From this point now, I'm working really hard and sending out tons of apps but I feel like I'm living a nightmare. Dad is gone, Mom is 73 and \*still working\* only because she enjoys her job but she's really showing her age, it occurred to me I might as well be speaking to her ghost before she eventually passes. My 40 year old sister has much more severe mental problems than what I've ever shown and is unable to support herself, leaving me to eventually do it.

  
It just feels like I accepted too deeply for years that I was always different, awkward, childish, maybe on the spectrum, maybe just plain unintelligent, and I should just continue with playing my shooter games and my aimless drives for iced coffee or just driving around - instead of focusing on a career and trying to remain firmly in society. Two days ago, after not hearing back from an employer that I thought I really nailed the interview with, just set alight all these awful feelings. I feel like if I bust my ass now and find some job, I'm basically preparing to die alone relatively comfortably, maybe while supporting my sister along the way.

  
Anyways, if anyone is of a similar age and going through something similar, please share, it eases the pain.",6,1767233169.0,depression,0,0.88,False

They waited til it was dark, of course. Better to camouflage our brilliant diamond-fire skin. 

Some might say it was an affliction. I think not. The vampire gift came to me unbidden, unwanted, but it was very much appreciated. Where before I was a lowly clerk at the bank, now I had real power. 

They told me I was unusual in more ways than one. My powers were fantastical, yes, but there was also the fact that I had not yet fed on a human and I had been a vampire for three days. It might be my last day, but it also might not. Who knows? 

All I could say was that I was alive....or rather, unalive...and that I refused to taste human blood. Aro and Caius and Marcus seemed unnerved by his affliction of empathy, but they kept him around anyway. 

For what purpose, I was not entirely sure. I just knew that they had offered multiple times to feed me a scared, struggling human, back in that dungeon chamber they kept me and the other newborns. Huh, newborns. Such a strangely juxtaposed title. Newborns are considered innocent and pure...and we were something quite contrary. 

A vampire called Felix led them from the dungeons to the highest chamber in this elegant castle of death. Now they stood alone, waiting for the leaders to come, I suspected. 

""Youre shaking,"" a quietly commanding voice spoke into the marble chamber. 

I jerked around and saw a small porcelain girl entering the room from a side door behind the three thrones. She wore a long black cloak over a simple black dress that hung to her shins. Her shoes were also understated, low black heels with a strap around the ankle and a tiny silver buckle on each. I noticed all of this with my vampire enhanced sight. I also noticed that this vampiress appeared completely unafraid in a room full of newborn, which added to her overall scare factor. 

I knew her name was Jane because I had heard other newborns whisper it, as if even the name was frightening. She was a disciple of the Volturi. 

""I'm speaking to you, October,"" Jane said calmly. 

I heard my name and realized her bright red eyes were focused on me while I was busy studying her aura of danger. ""Oh...yes, I'm shaking because I'm hungry,"" I replied, glancing down at my coffee brown suit. I wore suits to work and it just so happened that one of the Volturi guard but me while I was leaving work. 

""Why don't you drink blood already?"" Jane asked,  tad bit pointedly. 

I thought it best to stay silent. 

Jane continued to stare at me for a moment longer. ""I heard you manifested a power while in the dungeons,"" Jane went on. She folded her deathly white hands together. ""You made it rain and blow, am I correct?"" 

I nodded. 

""You will serve us well,"" Jane said. Then she turned to survey all of the newborn recruits. ""If you survive,"" she commented. 

I gulped. 

""You will all compete for the honor to be named a member of thr Guard,"" Jane elaborated in a cool, casual tone. ""Get in two orderly lines on each wall. Now."" 

Everyone listened. I counted the vampires ahead of me (5) and counted the ones behind me (4), and then counted the other line (7), all in under a half second. I also counted the number of times Jane blinked, all to distract myself from what was about to happen. 

I stretched and curled my fingers to try to call on my powers. I had only used them once before in a moment of distress. Yesterday, at noontime, he was thinking of how hopeless this situation was when the storm just...materialized. I didn't know how I did it, how I conjured the elements, but I needed to find a way to do it now, or else. 

""The duels will go one by one until only one is standing,"" Jane instructed. ""I want you to avoid making a mess, if you can. Aro, Caius, and Marcus will then greet the winner and--"" 

Before Jane could finish, a vampire started fighting the vampire in front of him in the opposite line. They tumbled over another vamp, who hissed and joined the frey. It escalated until an all-out brawl started. I glanced at Jane to discern what to do next and I saw that she was rolling her eyes but she didn't intervene. So I turned to shove the vampire behind me and kicked the one in front of me. My line started fighting as well. 

The sound of clashing stone filled the chamber as the vampires brawled. One brunette female vampire screamed as her arm was torn off and then she hissed at the attacker, causing him to gasp and twist backwards to the point of breaking in half. I made a note to watch out for her. 

The battle continued for over thirty minutes until there were three left. Me, the brunette, and a man with grizzly salt and pepper beard. 

""I don't want to hurt you both,"" Beard Man growled out. ""But I will if I have to."" 

""What are you proposing?"" Brunette demanded. She was holding her decapitated arm under her armpit like a baguette and twitching with anxious energy. 

""I propose we turn in this little missy and escape this hell hole,"" Beard Man snapped back. 

Brunette and Beardie turned to Jane and then turned to me, their expressions asking if I was in agreement with their plan. I looked to Jane and she was slightly smirking at the whole dilemma. 

""Well, October?"" Jane said. ""What is your final decision...?"" 

(To be finished in thirty minutes when I get home from work.)

This is the first part of a story I have been working on for a long, long time.

It will be shared in several parts over the coming days. I hope you take your time with it.

Thank you for reading.

**Prologue - The Mirror**

Kagami learned early that the world behaved better if he stayed still inside it.

Not motionless—he was not trying to disappear—but settled. Seated. Present. A cup cooling at his elbow. A notebook closed, then opened, then closed again. He liked places where movement belonged to other people, where it could pass by without asking anything of him.

Cafés were good for this. Parks. Train platforms, if he stood far enough back.

He would settle in somewhere quiet and let the world move around him like a river—currents of overweight businessmen, looking at young mothers, looking at their babies, looking at the birds. Attention flowed in predictable arcs, looping and breaking, never quite touching him. Kagami found comfort in watching it all pass.

It was during these pauses that he, too, noticed a bird.

A flash of red against winter branches. A certainty of color where the rest of the world preferred compromise. It appeared wherever Kagami found himself sitting long enough—on a fence rail, a low signpost, the iron arm of a streetlamp. Always visible. Never approaching.

He assumed, as people do, that this was coincidence dressed up as pattern.

The bird did not move much. It did not sing when Kagami was watching. It seemed content to exist in profile, head slightly angled, as if attending to the arrangement of things. Kagami felt no fear in its presence. If anything, he felt steadied. Not watched exactly—just included in something that did not shift when he did.

Once, idly, he tried to test it. He packed up early and left a place just as he’d begun to feel settled, walked three blocks farther than usual, and sat again.

The bird was already there.

That was the first moment Kagami felt something like discomfort, though he did not name it that. He smiled instead, the way one does when the universe makes a small joke at one’s expense. He told himself the bird was common. Cardinals were everywhere, after all. Bright things only seemed rare because they were memorable.

He did not consider that remembrance might be a form of invitation.

When Kagami finally caught his reflection in the café window, it was layered—his face faintly superimposed over passing strangers, the glass holding both without committing to either. Beyond it, in the same pane, the red shape of the bird remained.

He lifted his hand.  
The reflection lifted its hand with him.

The bird did not move.

For reasons he could not have explained, Kagami felt suddenly that the noticing had gone both ways.

He looked away first.

**Chapter One - Crumbs**

Kagami fell into habits the way other people fell asleep—without ceremony, and only realizing it had happened after the fact.

On certain mornings he settled into the same small café near the park, the kind with mismatched chairs and a chalkboard menu that never quite erased clean. He brought a notebook he didn’t always write in, ordered coffee he drank too slowly, and took a seat near the window or outside if the weather permitted.

From there, he let the day pass him by—businessmen, mothers, babies, birds.

He often bought a muffin with his coffee. Pistachio, when they had it.

He had never liked leaving food unfinished. Not out of principle, exactly—no inherited rule or remembered admonition—but because it made him uneasy in the same way loose ends did. Crumbs left behind felt like small refusals, choices abandoned halfway through. When he stood to refill his coffee or stretch his legs, he brushed the larger pieces aside with a careless motion, setting them at the edge of the table or on the ground nearby. It felt better than leaving them where they were.

When he came back, the crumbs were gone.

This was not, initially, remarkable. Wind existed. Ants existed. The café staff had a habit of quietly clearing things away when customers weren’t looking. Kagami noticed the absence only because he noticed most small things, and even then it registered as little more than a curiosity.

It happened again a few days later.

He had stepped away for no more than a minute—long enough to retrieve a napkin he’d forgotten earlier. When he returned, his coffee sat exactly where he’d left it, still warm. His notebook lay open to a blank page. His pen rested across the spine.

But the crumbs were gone again. Every one of them.

Kagami frowned, more at the neatness of it than the fact itself. He glanced at the ground, half-expecting to see the remains scattered below. There was nothing.

“Well,” he murmured, to no one in particular.

For a moment, he considered the possibility that he was misremembering—overestimating how much he’d eaten, underestimating how long he’d been gone. He brushed his fingers across the tabletop as if the crumbs might reappear under touch. They did not.

At the park, the thought barely occurred to him at all.

The bench overlooked a narrow creek crossed by a low wooden bridge. People passed over it constantly, but the bench itself was often unoccupied. Kagami sat there with his coffee and muffin, watching the water slip around stones smoothed pale by time. The open air made everything feel simpler, more explainable. Birds could take crumbs here. Squirrels. The world had room to account for small losses.

When he stood to lean against the railing—no more than a handful of seconds—he did so without thinking.

When he turned back, the bench was unchanged.

Except for the empty space where the rest of his muffin had been.

Not crumbs this time.

All of it.

No wrapper. No smudge. No evidence that it had ever been there at all.

Kagami stood very still.

He checked beneath the bench. He checked the ground around it. He even looked up, absurdly, at the branches overhead. Nothing had been disturbed. The water kept moving. People kept crossing the bridge. The world had not reacted in the slightest to the absence he was now acutely aware of.

A laugh escaped him before he could stop it, thin and uncertain.

“Alright,” he said. “You win.”

He did not know who he was speaking to.

When he sat again, he noticed the bird across the creek, red against the green-brown hush of the trees. It watched him with the same quiet attention it always had.

This time, Kagami did not look away.

He gathered his things and left the park with the uneasy sense that something small had been accepted—and that he had no idea what, if anything, he had agreed to in return.

**Chapter Two - Stones**

Kagami first noticed the painted stones the way he noticed most things—without deciding to.

They appeared along the paths he already walked, resting on guardrails or tucked into the crook of exposed roots, small enough to be missed if you were moving too quickly. Some were bright, others careful. Flowers, trees, simple words. A few were nothing more than patterns of color, as if the painter had lost interest halfway through and decided that was enough.

He liked that about them.

They didn’t ask to be kept. They didn’t insist on being understood. They were left in places where discovery felt accidental, as though the stones themselves had simply paused there to catch their breath.

Kagami never saw anyone leave one. He never saw anyone take one either. The stones appeared, and then, at some later point, they were gone. That felt right. Temporary. Honest.

He began to look for them when he walked—along the creek, near the café, by the low bridge where people stopped to watch the water slide past the rocks below. Finding one gave him a small, unearned lift, like overhearing good news meant for someone else.

For a while, that was enough.

The idea of painting his own stone came to him slowly, not as inspiration so much as inevitability. He found himself picking up smooth rocks near the creek and turning them over in his hands, testing their weight, noticing how they caught the light. Some felt wrong immediately. Others he slipped into his pocket without quite knowing why.

When he finally sat down with a marker and a cup of coffee, he didn’t think of it as making art.

He painted what he liked.

A small cabin, roughly squared. Trees suggested with vertical strokes. A line of hills behind them, uneven but steady. He worked carefully, not because the drawing was difficult, but because he wanted to do it justice—to leave something that felt considered, even if it wasn’t impressive.

On the back, after a moment’s hesitation, he wrote nothing at all.

The next morning, he left the stone on the guardrail near the bridge and walked away without looking back.

He told himself he would forget about it.

He didn’t.

When he returned that afternoon, the stone was gone.

Kagami felt a flicker of disappointment, quickly followed by relief. That was how it was supposed to work. Someone else had found it. Someone else was carrying it now, or setting it down somewhere new. The thought pleased him enough that he painted another stone that evening, and then another a few days later.

Some stayed where he left them. Some disappeared.

The pattern held.

Until one didn’t.

It was a stone he liked more than the others. Not because it was better drawn—if anything, the lines were rougher—but because the shape of it fit his hand exactly, as though it had been waiting for him. He hesitated before leaving it, turning it over once more, considering taking it home instead.

He left it anyway.

When he came back less than twenty minutes later, it was gone.

That unsettled him more than he expected. Not because it had been taken, but because of how quickly. The absence felt intentional, as though someone had been waiting for the moment his back was turned.

Kagami stood by the railing longer than usual, looking down at the creek, then along the path in both directions. No one nearby seemed to be paying him any attention. A couple crossed the bridge laughing, oblivious. A dog strained at its leash.

He told himself not to invent meaning where there was none.

The next day, he returned.

The stone on the guardrail was not the one he had left.

This one was rougher, darker. The paint was uneven, the lines heavy-handed. The image itself was simple enough to be unmistakable: a bird, wings folded, profile turned slightly to the side.

Kagami’s chest tightened.

He picked up the stone and turned it over. The back was blank.

Slowly, he lifted his gaze to the trees beyond the creek.

The Cardinal sat openly on a low branch, red bright against the muted greens and browns. It did not move when Kagami looked at it. It did not flinch or take flight. It simply remained, exactly as it always had, head angled as if in quiet consideration.

The logic arrived fully formed, without effort.

The bird had been watching him all along.  
The bird had seen the stones.  
The bird had answered.

Kagami felt a ripple of unease—not fear, but something closer to exposure. As though a private gesture had been acknowledged aloud.

He looked back down at the stone in his hand.

It was imperfect. Almost crude. And yet there was no mistaking what it was meant to be.

Kagami slipped the stone into his pocket and left the park.

Behind him, the Cardinal remained where it was, silent and still, while the creek continued its patient work below the bridge, wearing stone into stone into stone.

**Chapter Three - Replies**

Kagami found the coin on a Tuesday, after work, when the light was already beginning to soften in ways that made him forgive the day.

It lay near the edge of the path by the creek, half-hidden in a shallow groove worn smooth by water and shoes and time. He noticed it first because of its color. Not silver, not bronze—something darker. Lustrous. Almost blued, like steel that had been held to heat and cooled too carefully.

He picked it up and turned it over in his fingers.

It was heavier than he expected. The markings were shallow, unfamiliar, softened as if they had never been meant to be read quickly. He slipped it into his pocket without much thought and continued toward the café, already feeling the excitement that came from finding something he hadn’t been looking for.

The stone he left that day was simple. No bird this time. Just lines and shapes he liked the feel of. When he set it down near the bench, he didn’t wait to see if anything happened.

At the café, the coin sat between his coffee and his notebook while he worked through the last of his muffin. He kept picking it up, letting the light catch it, watching the color deepen and fade depending on the angle. It absorbed brightness rather than reflecting it, as if the shine belonged to the surface and nowhere else.

He took it to the coin shop the next afternoon.

The place smelled faintly of dust and metal and old paper. The lights were warm and dim, tired incandescents from decades past. Everything was wood—counters, shelves, drawers—with glass cases inset like careful afterthoughts. Coins lay in shallow trays or paper pouches, stacked and sorted with a casual reverence, as though even the smallest pieces had earned their rest.

The man behind the counter turned the coin over slowly, then again, then once more beneath a small lamp.

“I’ve never seen this,” he said finally. Not with excitement, but with interest. “Not like this.”

He frowned, thoughtful, then smiled apologetically. “I can look into it, if you like. Might take a day or two.”

Kagami nodded. He left his name and number, feeling oddly light as he stepped back outside, as though he had handed off a question he hadn’t realized he was carrying.

On the walk home, his shoelace snapped.

It happened suddenly, mid-step, sending him stumbling forward just enough to spill the last of his coffee onto the pavement. The cup rolled to a stop against the curb. Kagami stared at it for a moment, then laughed quietly to himself.

He bent to assess the damage and found the lace frayed through at the knot, useless. With a sigh, he tied what remained as best he could and continued on, the shoe slipping with each step.

By the time he reached the park bench, the knot gave way entirely, his shoe hanging open like a gaping grin.

Kagami sat, considering his options, when he noticed a length of garden twine snagged in the low brush beside the bench. It was rough and sun-faded, caught on a thorn as if it had been waiting.

He freed it, threaded it through the eyelets, and pulled it as tight as he dared. His knot wasn’t elegant, but it held.

“That’ll do,” he said aloud, testing his weight.

The Cardinal watched from across the creek, red against the trees. Kagami nodded to it once, then gathered his things and headed toward the bus stop.

He was halfway there when the twine gave up.

One strand snapped. Then another. By the time he reached the curb, the knot was already loosening. He crouched to tie it back together just as the bus came into view at the end of the street.

As he bent, something dark caught his eye in the shallow ditch beside the road.

Not the shape—just the color.

A slick of oil spread thinly across the water pooled there, marbled with impossible rainbows. Blues and purples and greens twisted together, luminous in the afternoon light. Kagami watched it for a moment, genuinely taken with the beauty of it, the way the colors shifted as the surface trembled.

Beneath the sheen, for the briefest instant, he thought he saw something darker still.

Metallic. Lustrous.

The bus hissed to a stop at the corner. Kagami looked up instinctively.

When he looked back down, the colors were still there—beautiful, swirling, complete—but there was nothing else to see.

The bus pulled away.

Kagami sat back on his heels and laughed, a little breathless this time. He straightened slowly, the ruined shoelace dangling uselessly, and checked his watch.

Twenty minutes.

He stood there a while longer, watching the oil ripple and shift, appreciating it fully now that he had nothing else to do. The afternoon was quiet. The delay felt manageable. Explainable.

By the time he reached home, the feeling had dulled into something he could ignore.

The next morning, the call from the coin shop went to voicemail.

Later that day, when he stopped by the bench on his way through the park, there was a length of bootlace laid neatly across the seat. Long. Sturdy. Far more than he needed.

Kagami stood over it for a moment, then smiled faintly and shook his head.

“I already fixed it,” he said, looking down at the new shoelaces he had dug out of his dresser drawer.

The Cardinal remained where it was, silent and still.

Kagami left the lace where it lay and walked on, feeling helped in ways he could not quite align, and for the first time, vaguely tired of trying.

What a year it has been. I can call it good in my own little bubble but for the wider world, a rather rancid affair in many ways. I can say that with relative certainty because off the top of my head, I can think of a thousand bad things that happened and almost no good. But that is not exactly fair. If I claimed nothing good happened that would include my own life, wouldn't it? And many good things happened for me; I published Midnight Whorrors and started writing I'm Still Sisyphus, not to mention a bunch of other little projects. I am sure there are a bunch of others in the world with little joys that came about this year that also deserve to be acknowledged, even if it does not erase the bad. In fact, let me look it up. The world deserves that. What good things have happened in 2025?

The Global Ocean Treaty was signed in September. I had no idea. So many governments, no matter how I have criticized them in the past and will in the future, decided together to protect our seas unlike ever before and that is something wonderful. What else is there? Oh, the COP16 deal was signed to protect environmental biodiversity! Another win for the world. The green sea turtle is no longer endangered. Deforestation rate has slowed. Many countries are moving alway from the use of fossil fuels. There have been so many advances in medical technology; gene therapy is helping return sight and hearing to the impaired as well as treating some types of cancers! From what I am reading we seem to be in a 'golden age of cancer treatment,' which is absolutely something to celebrate. Finally, for all it seems that so many human rights are slipping through our fingers, there actually were many advancements; Liechtenstein and Thailand have finally legalized same-sex marriage. Mexico has made massive strives to lift their most vulnerable citizens out of poverty. For all the violence and fear make journalist's pencils wag, there is actually an overall decline of violent crime happening all over the world. The bad screams loud as a banshee but the good is there to, the base and beat that may not always be acknowledged but makes it's mark on the melody nonetheless.

But enough about the world, what about me? I am the main character here, aren't I? My day was good. Father was drinking last night so I was up a little late and out of bed later but I did get a good deal of things done. I shovelled the driveway and refilled the bird feeders again. It has been steadily storming all day. It is lovely scenery as long as it is outside the window. That is why I was so worried when Father said he and cooper came across a cat near the feeders tonight when returning for a walk. The same one I saw stalking the feeders a few days ago, I think. I swear, I'd love to smack the fool that let the poor thing out in this weather. I desperately wanted to go out looking for it, but I know it'd be a fool's errand. I can only hope Cooper scared it home and its humans find the sense to keep it there.

Anyway, I was reluctant to write today so I spent the first part of today doing anything. All other chores; watering plants, vacuuming, cleaning the kitchen, etc. I did start next chapter's outline last night and I like what I have. I think I am just a little tired. It is only Wednesday but Christmas makes it feel like it should be Saturday. I did eventually get myself to write. Partly because it is new years and I want to end the year productively. Most especially I wrote 510 words because now I can end the year celebrating that I'm Still Sisyphus is officially over 100,000 words! 100,030 words to be specific. I wanted to write just enough to say that proudly. The second to last chapter isn't quite done. I could have pushed to finish it but I didn't want to work too hard today. Sometimes we have to give ourselves a soft workload.

Well, I have metaphorically talked your ear off, haven't I? I'll let you be on your way. Happy New Year. I am going to make myself an evening coffee and relax for the last, now three hours of 2025.

I got hired at a coffee shop because it was the only place that would take me in a year of searching.... and it sucks

Again, maybe I just need to get used to it, but it's so fast paced that I'm not actually getting any training. I'm just looking over people's shoulders and not retaining anything: I got told ""I wish I could explain this to you, but it's too busy so I can't."" My manager seems like a hard nut and she already made me cry on my second day because I accidentally put the wrong item into the cash register and she very harshly said ""why did you do that?!"" My coworkers also told me that she's known to scream at everyone in front of customers and the owner is the only one who can reign her in. The amount of multitasking just isn't for me and I already know that I'm going to quit at some point; I don't need this job for any serious reasons (which I know I am very lucky) just for some extra cash & some buffer on my resume as i seek an internship. I cried for 7 hours after my first shift (lol) and I'm sitting here on my day off on NYE thinking about it nonstop and dreading going back tomorrow because it just isn't for me

On top of that I've asked several times if I have to sign paperwork to be a legally documented worker there and I've either gotten noncommittal responses or been told by the owner ""oh did [manager] not get you that yet?"" Nothing came of it. That's the only real genuine red flag that's blatant to me

I also have another interview set up on Saturday for another job that might suit me better, but I'm not sure if I should even bother quitting when I don't have a guarantee of having another job. I'm a student and I think once classes start again the stress would kill me
I know I'm very privileged to be able to consider this when so many other people are looking for jobs, but I seriously just feel that I'm not going to be able to thrive in this environment when it's eating at me every second I'm not at work. It's just so embarrassing to think about quitting this early on and I'm so worried what they'll think of me. Mostly a vent but I'd love to hear some opinions 🫣 thank you.

This gives me both the satisfaction of having an empty in relatively short order, and the freedom to enjoy the rest of my collection for the rest of the week.

Overall lessons:

\* It takes a long time to get through even a sample – this is coming from someone who likes to slather

\* I'm still FSing earlier than I should, which you'll see in my flash reviews below.

\* But I'm becoming more mindful of what I have, and this will hopefully translate into more mindful purchases

BPAL:

\* **Wensleydale:** the steam after a hot shower. Soap is a note, not an attribute. *Repurchase?* Impossible now. **Bathed in Sunlight (BHT)** is a worthy spiritual successor, we'll see if I want to FS that.

\* **Ninon:** dupe of **Chergui (SL)**. *Repurchase?* Also impossible. Besides, I have a circa 2010 bottle of actual Chergui.

\* **The Dormouse:** slightly astringent tea and florals. *FS?* I prefer **The Apothecary** if I had to choose a BPAL in this genre, and I have a bottle of **Haiku (Alkemia)** that is currently filling this niche.

\* **Yemaya:** 90s/00s cucumber melon, but fruitier. *FS?* I'm more tempted than I thought I would be.

\* **Dead Leaves, Blood Orange, and Neroli:** sharp and (modern) cologne-y, with a hint of orange juice. *FS?* No, I don't think the Dead Leaves line is for me.

\* **Resembling the Passion of Love:** I've said before that this is **The Elephant is Slow to Mate** but dialed down a bit. *FS?* I have, but am starting to regret it. Even though it's less intense than Elephant, it is still Too Much for me most days.

\* **Dantalion:** Chai spices and clammy existential dread. *FS?* I have a 4ml that I haven't touched.

\* **Luna Di Miele:** opens with a brief jasmine tea, dries down to a sunny honey. *FS?* I have a 4ml that I'll probably use, but I probably would've been fine without, only because I have so many sunny-sweet perfumes.

Chasing Scents:

\* **Tea Service:** iced oolong tea, half sugar half ice. *FS?* Yep, no regrets.

\* **Weeping Rose:** contrary to the name, a fun and fruity rose + apple. *FS?* maybe a travel spray, we'll see how much I miss it.

It will be shared in several parts over the coming days. I hope you take your time with it.

Thank you for reading.

**Prologue - The Mirror**

Kagami learned early that the world behaved better if he stayed still inside it.

Not motionless—he was not trying to disappear—but settled. Seated. Present. A cup cooling at his elbow. A notebook closed, then opened, then closed again. He liked places where movement belonged to other people, where it could pass by without asking anything of him.

Cafés were good for this. Parks. Train platforms, if he stood far enough back.

He would settle in somewhere quiet and let the world move around him like a river—currents of overweight businessmen, looking at young mothers, looking at their babies, looking at the birds. Attention flowed in predictable arcs, looping and breaking, never quite touching him. Kagami found comfort in watching it all pass.

It was during these pauses that he, too, noticed a bird.

A flash of red against winter branches. A certainty of color where the rest of the world preferred compromise. It appeared wherever Kagami found himself sitting long enough—on a fence rail, a low signpost, the iron arm of a streetlamp. Always visible. Never approaching.

He assumed, as people do, that this was coincidence dressed up as pattern.

The bird did not move much. It did not sing when Kagami was watching. It seemed content to exist in profile, head slightly angled, as if attending to the arrangement of things. Kagami felt no fear in its presence. If anything, he felt steadied. Not watched exactly—just included in something that did not shift when he did.

Once, idly, he tried to test it. He packed up early and left a place just as he’d begun to feel settled, walked three blocks farther than usual, and sat again.

The bird was already there.

That was the first moment Kagami felt something like discomfort, though he did not name it that. He smiled instead, the way one does when the universe makes a small joke at one’s expense. He told himself the bird was common. Cardinals were everywhere, after all. Bright things only seemed rare because they were memorable.

He did not consider that remembrance might be a form of invitation.

When Kagami finally caught his reflection in the café window, it was layered—his face faintly superimposed over passing strangers, the glass holding both without committing to either. Beyond it, in the same pane, the red shape of the bird remained.

He lifted his hand.  
The reflection lifted its hand with him.

The bird did not move.

For reasons he could not have explained, Kagami felt suddenly that the noticing had gone both ways.

He looked away first.



**Chapter One - Crumbs**

Kagami fell into habits the way other people fell asleep—without ceremony, and only realizing it had happened after the fact.

On certain mornings he settled into the same small café near the park, the kind with mismatched chairs and a chalkboard menu that never quite erased clean. He brought a notebook he didn’t always write in, ordered coffee he drank too slowly, and took a seat near the window or outside if the weather permitted.

From there, he let the day pass him by—businessmen, mothers, babies, birds.

He often bought a muffin with his coffee. Pistachio, when they had it.

He had never liked leaving food unfinished. Not out of principle, exactly—no inherited rule or remembered admonition—but because it made him uneasy in the same way loose ends did. Crumbs left behind felt like small refusals, choices abandoned halfway through. When he stood to refill his coffee or stretch his legs, he brushed the larger pieces aside with a careless motion, setting them at the edge of the table or on the ground nearby. It felt better than leaving them where they were.

When he came back, the crumbs were gone.

This was not, initially, remarkable. Wind existed. Ants existed. The café staff had a habit of quietly clearing things away when customers weren’t looking. Kagami noticed the absence only because he noticed most small things, and even then it registered as little more than a curiosity.

It happened again a few days later.

He had stepped away for no more than a minute—long enough to retrieve a napkin he’d forgotten earlier. When he returned, his coffee sat exactly where he’d left it, still warm. His notebook lay open to a blank page. His pen rested across the spine.

But the crumbs were gone again. Every one of them.

Kagami frowned, more at the neatness of it than the fact itself. He glanced at the ground, half-expecting to see the remains scattered below. There was nothing.

“Well,” he murmured, to no one in particular.

For a moment, he considered the possibility that he was misremembering—overestimating how much he’d eaten, underestimating how long he’d been gone. He brushed his fingers across the tabletop as if the crumbs might reappear under touch. They did not.

At the park, the thought barely occurred to him at all.

The bench overlooked a narrow creek crossed by a low wooden bridge. People passed over it constantly, but the bench itself was often unoccupied. Kagami sat there with his coffee and muffin, watching the water slip around stones smoothed pale by time. The open air made everything feel simpler, more explainable. Birds could take crumbs here. Squirrels. The world had room to account for small losses.

When he stood to lean against the railing—no more than a handful of seconds—he did so without thinking.

When he turned back, the bench was unchanged.

Except for the empty space where the rest of his muffin had been.

Not crumbs this time.

All of it.

No wrapper. No smudge. No evidence that it had ever been there at all.

Kagami stood very still.

He checked beneath the bench. He checked the ground around it. He even looked up, absurdly, at the branches overhead. Nothing had been disturbed. The water kept moving. People kept crossing the bridge. The world had not reacted in the slightest to the absence he was now acutely aware of.

A laugh escaped him before he could stop it, thin and uncertain.

“Alright,” he said. “You win.”

He did not know who he was speaking to.

When he sat again, he noticed the bird across the creek, red against the green-brown hush of the trees. It watched him with the same quiet attention it always had.

This time, Kagami did not look away.

He gathered his things and left the park with the uneasy sense that something small had been accepted—and that he had no idea what, if anything, he had agreed to in return.



**Chapter Two - Stones**

Kagami first noticed the painted stones the way he noticed most things—without deciding to.

They appeared along the paths he already walked, resting on guardrails or tucked into the crook of exposed roots, small enough to be missed if you were moving too quickly. Some were bright, others careful. Flowers, trees, simple words. A few were nothing more than patterns of color, as if the painter had lost interest halfway through and decided that was enough.

He liked that about them.

They didn’t ask to be kept. They didn’t insist on being understood. They were left in places where discovery felt accidental, as though the stones themselves had simply paused there to catch their breath.

Kagami never saw anyone leave one. He never saw anyone take one either. The stones appeared, and then, at some later point, they were gone. That felt right. Temporary. Honest.

He began to look for them when he walked—along the creek, near the café, by the low bridge where people stopped to watch the water slide past the rocks below. Finding one gave him a small, unearned lift, like overhearing good news meant for someone else.

For a while, that was enough.

The idea of painting his own stone came to him slowly, not as inspiration so much as inevitability. He found himself picking up smooth rocks near the creek and turning them over in his hands, testing their weight, noticing how they caught the light. Some felt wrong immediately. Others he slipped into his pocket without quite knowing why.

When he finally sat down with a marker and a cup of coffee, he didn’t think of it as making art.

He painted what he liked.

A small cabin, roughly squared. Trees suggested with vertical strokes. A line of hills behind them, uneven but steady. He worked carefully, not because the drawing was difficult, but because he wanted to do it justice—to leave something that felt considered, even if it wasn’t impressive.

On the back, after a moment’s hesitation, he wrote nothing at all.

The next morning, he left the stone on the guardrail near the bridge and walked away without looking back.

He told himself he would forget about it.

He didn’t.

When he returned that afternoon, the stone was gone.

Kagami felt a flicker of disappointment, quickly followed by relief. That was how it was supposed to work. Someone else had found it. Someone else was carrying it now, or setting it down somewhere new. The thought pleased him enough that he painted another stone that evening, and then another a few days later.

Some stayed where he left them. Some disappeared.

The pattern held.

Until one didn’t.

It was a stone he liked more than the others. Not because it was better drawn—if anything, the lines were rougher—but because the shape of it fit his hand exactly, as though it had been waiting for him. He hesitated before leaving it, turning it over once more, considering taking it home instead.

He left it anyway.

When he came back less than twenty minutes later, it was gone.

That unsettled him more than he expected. Not because it had been taken, but because of how quickly. The absence felt intentional, as though someone had been waiting for the moment his back was turned.

Kagami stood by the railing longer than usual, looking down at the creek, then along the path in both directions. No one nearby seemed to be paying him any attention. A couple crossed the bridge laughing, oblivious. A dog strained at its leash.

He told himself not to invent meaning where there was none.

The next day, he returned.

The stone on the guardrail was not the one he had left.

This one was rougher, darker. The paint was uneven, the lines heavy-handed. The image itself was simple enough to be unmistakable: a bird, wings folded, profile turned slightly to the side.

Kagami’s chest tightened.

He picked up the stone and turned it over. The back was blank.

Slowly, he lifted his gaze to the trees beyond the creek.

The Cardinal sat openly on a low branch, red bright against the muted greens and browns. It did not move when Kagami looked at it. It did not flinch or take flight. It simply remained, exactly as it always had, head angled as if in quiet consideration.

The logic arrived fully formed, without effort.

The bird had been watching him all along.  
The bird had seen the stones.  
The bird had answered.

Kagami felt a ripple of unease—not fear, but something closer to exposure. As though a private gesture had been acknowledged aloud.

He looked back down at the stone in his hand.

It was imperfect. Almost crude. And yet there was no mistaking what it was meant to be.

Kagami slipped the stone into his pocket and left the park.

Behind him, the Cardinal remained where it was, silent and still, while the creek continued its patient work below the bridge, wearing stone into stone into stone.



**Chapter Three - Replies**

Kagami found the coin on a Tuesday, after work, when the light was already beginning to soften in ways that made him forgive the day.

It lay near the edge of the path by the creek, half-hidden in a shallow groove worn smooth by water and shoes and time. He noticed it first because of its color. Not silver, not bronze—something darker. Lustrous. Almost blued, like steel that had been held to heat and cooled too carefully.

He picked it up and turned it over in his fingers.

It was heavier than he expected. The markings were shallow, unfamiliar, softened as if they had never been meant to be read quickly. He slipped it into his pocket without much thought and continued toward the café, already feeling the excitement that came from finding something he hadn’t been looking for.

The stone he left that day was simple. No bird this time. Just lines and shapes he liked the feel of. When he set it down near the bench, he didn’t wait to see if anything happened.

At the café, the coin sat between his coffee and his notebook while he worked through the last of his muffin. He kept picking it up, letting the light catch it, watching the color deepen and fade depending on the angle. It absorbed brightness rather than reflecting it, as if the shine belonged to the surface and nowhere else.

He took it to the coin shop the next afternoon.

The place smelled faintly of dust and metal and old paper. The lights were warm and dim, tired incandescents from decades past. Everything was wood—counters, shelves, drawers—with glass cases inset like careful afterthoughts. Coins lay in shallow trays or paper pouches, stacked and sorted with a casual reverence, as though even the smallest pieces had earned their rest.

The man behind the counter turned the coin over slowly, then again, then once more beneath a small lamp.

“I’ve never seen this,” he said finally. Not with excitement, but with interest. “Not like this.”

He frowned, thoughtful, then smiled apologetically. “I can look into it, if you like. Might take a day or two.”

Kagami nodded. He left his name and number, feeling oddly light as he stepped back outside, as though he had handed off a question he hadn’t realized he was carrying.

On the walk home, his shoelace snapped.

It happened suddenly, mid-step, sending him stumbling forward just enough to spill the last of his coffee onto the pavement. The cup rolled to a stop against the curb. Kagami stared at it for a moment, then laughed quietly to himself.

He bent to assess the damage and found the lace frayed through at the knot, useless. With a sigh, he tied what remained as best he could and continued on, the shoe slipping with each step.

By the time he reached the park bench, the knot gave way entirely, his shoe hanging open like a gaping grin.

Kagami sat, considering his options, when he noticed a length of garden twine snagged in the low brush beside the bench. It was rough and sun-faded, caught on a thorn as if it had been waiting.

He freed it, threaded it through the eyelets, and pulled it as tight as he dared. His knot wasn’t elegant, but it held.

“That’ll do,” he said aloud, testing his weight.

The Cardinal watched from across the creek, red against the trees. Kagami nodded to it once, then gathered his things and headed toward the bus stop.

He was halfway there when the twine gave up.

One strand snapped. Then another. By the time he reached the curb, the knot was already loosening. He crouched to tie it back together just as the bus came into view at the end of the street.

As he bent, something dark caught his eye in the shallow ditch beside the road.

Not the shape—just the color.

A slick of oil spread thinly across the water pooled there, marbled with impossible rainbows. Blues and purples and greens twisted together, luminous in the afternoon light. Kagami watched it for a moment, genuinely taken with the beauty of it, the way the colors shifted as the surface trembled.

Beneath the sheen, for the briefest instant, he thought he saw something darker still.

Metallic. Lustrous.

The bus hissed to a stop at the corner. Kagami looked up instinctively.

When he looked back down, the colors were still there—beautiful, swirling, complete—but there was nothing else to see.

The bus pulled away.

Kagami sat back on his heels and laughed, a little breathless this time. He straightened slowly, the ruined shoelace dangling uselessly, and checked his watch.

Twenty minutes.

He stood there a while longer, watching the oil ripple and shift, appreciating it fully now that he had nothing else to do. The afternoon was quiet. The delay felt manageable. Explainable.

By the time he reached home, the feeling had dulled into something he could ignore.

The next morning, the call from the coin shop went to voicemail.

Later that day, when he stopped by the bench on his way through the park, there was a length of bootlace laid neatly across the seat. Long. Sturdy. Far more than he needed.

Kagami stood over it for a moment, then smiled faintly and shook his head.

“I already fixed it,” he said, looking down at the new shoelaces he had dug out of his dresser drawer.

The Cardinal remained where it was, silent and still.

Kagami left the lace where it lay and walked on, feeling helped in ways he could not quite align, and for the first time, vaguely tired of trying.

I love my husband and my child deeply, and I have good men in my life who I respect and care about.
Lately though, my social media algorithms (especially Facebook) have been pushing a lot of redpill / manosphere content. I try not to engage with it, and my husband tells me not to watch it because a lot of it is extreme — but even just seeing the comments has been getting to me. I’ve read things from men saying women shouldn’t vote, aren’t equal, should have their rights taken away, or are only valued for sex.
Even though I know this doesn’t represent all men, it’s started to mess with my head emotionally. I love doing things for my husband — cooking, cuddling, making his coffee in the morning — but sometimes those online voices creep in and make me wonder things I don’t normally worry about, like: does he see me as less valuable than him? Does he only want me for sex? (One comment that stuck with me was “men don’t like women, they only like what’s between their legs.”)
It’s also made me anxious as a mom. I worry irrationally sometimes: is my son going to grow up thinking women are lesser, or that he’s better than me because I’m a woman?
I’m not here to argue or blame men — I’m genuinely just looking for reassurance and perspective from men who don’t buy into that stuff. How do you actually see women in your lives — your partners, wives, mothers, daughters? And how do you raise sons to respect women?

1q0sy39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1q0sy39/grade_iv_hemorroidectomy_5_days_postop/,Grade IV hemorroidectomy 5 days post-op,"**TL;DR:** The first few days were some of the hardest of my life. But I’m recovering quickly now, and NO REGRETS. I needed this surgery and am glad I didn’t put it off. Scroll down to “The Surgery” if you aren’t interested in why I decided to do this and how I prepped.

**Context / About Me:** 48-year-old woman, family history of hemorrhoids on mom’s side. They started bothering me 19 years ago when I was pregnant with my first (of two) kids. Pregnancy and postpartum were tough with both kids. Needed prescription relief during and after pregnancy #2. Flare-ups happened, usually mild to moderate, in subsequent years, but nothing horribly chronic.

I’m quite healthy: a runner since age 40 who does a bit of strength training a few times a week, mostly to keep myself in good shape for running and to have a strong core as I get older. I eat mostly plants. Running usually keeps chronic constipation (another fun genetic gift — bothered me a lot more in 20s and 30s) at bay.

Perimenopausal… not sure if that’s relevant, but it seems to affect everything else, so who knows?

**Deciding on Surgery:** Mom had painful, chronic issues for years before she broke down and went under the knife. She said she wished she’d done it at least a decade earlier and urged me to do it as soon as my issues became more regular. I started having more frequent, painful flare-ups in January 2025. Summer ‘25 it became nearly constant. Pain for hours after every bowel movement. Had to cut back on running. Real quality of life impact pushed me past my embarrassment… the stigma about hemorrhoids is ridiculous but real! Went to my doc in September, got a steroid suppository (very effective, but can only be taken for a few days) and a referral to a surgeon.

Turns out the surgeon is head of colorectal surgery at a big, respected hospital in Boston. He let me know they have a pretty high bar for who they recommend for surgery. He then took one look at my Grade IV hemorrhoids and said, “I recommend surgery.” I was so relieved! He explained that this would be life changing in the long term, but that the recovery is very rough. He actually said something like, “5 days of hell.” I have an anaphylactic allergy to NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen), and he said that would be tough. I appreciated his candor.

**The Surgery:** I had two whole weeks scheduled off for the holidays, so we set it up for December 26. To prep:

* I took 2 stool softener pills daily for a week ahead of time. *(I wish I’d done miralax for a few days too)*
* I continued the 6 g of daily psyllium fiber I had already been doing for a few months
* I increased my water intake by alternating water with coffee / tea, my normal beverages at work
* I ate a very high fiber diet and bought / prepared high fiber foods to have ready for after surgery
* Christmas was the day before. I tried my best to avoid junk and not overeat

Surgery itself was quick and simple. They removed 2 columns (I had them in all 3, but he’d explained that they don’t remove all 3 because of much higher risk of rectal stenosis. He assured me this would still be an enormous improvement.) I went home still numb, with instructions for 1000 mg acetaminophen every 8 hours and tramadol 50 mg (fairly mild narcotic) every 6 hours.

**The Recovery, Days 0-5:**

Day 0

* Local anesthetic wore off mid-afternoon and pain set in. Tramadol worked for 2 hours tops… and then I had to wait hours before taking more. I accidentally had a natural childbirth with my son (wanted the epidural, but he came too quickly), so that’s a “10” on my personal pain scale. This was 7-8 and I had no idea how I’d handle it for 5 days. Really discouraged.
* The worst part, though, was that starting at 8 PM I could not urinate. Swelling and muscle spasms were bad, but with my NSAID allergy I couldn’t do anything about inflammation. I’d been drinking a ton of water and was extremely uncomfortable. They’d told me to call if I couldn’t pee for 6 hours. At 11:30 PM I got a little urine out in the shower.

Day 1

* Tramadol still not cutting it.
* Could get a little bit of pee out at once, but couldn’t empty bladder. Called doctor. He was worried. He prescribed oxycodone for pain and Valium for muscle spasms. Told me to try peeing in a hot bath and to call him if I still couldn’t empty.
* A few hours later — pain better, but still no luck with urination. Doc said I needed to go to the ER (it was a Saturday) and get a Foley catheter inserted.
* I urinated  right after getting off the phone. More than before (still couldn’t empty) and decided to wait a couple of hours and see if it kept improving.
* Over the course of the rest of the day, I peed more regularly and more successfully. Avoided the catheter!
* Oxycodone was a lifesaver.
* Literally probably spent 5 hours a day in the bathtub. It was often the only way I could pee, and it helped a ton with swelling.

Day 2

* Peeing more regularly again, but couldn’t empty. Not out of the woods yet… thought it was 50/50 that I’d end up with a catheter. Didn’t happen, though: I finally started emptying my bladder by bedtime. Wow, what a relief!
* Took 30 mL milk of magnesia in the morning, since I hadn’t had a bowel movement yet. Had one within a few hours. 6-7 on pain scale but quick. A little worse than the first one after childbirth, but not as bad as I’d feared.
* Another small bowel movement a few hours later. Not very painful.
* Took milk of magnesia again at bedtime.

Day 3

* Took milk of magnesia when I woke up.
* Oxy was now working for 4 full hours (rather than 3 hours, with an hour of waiting till I could take more.) Pain at 2-4. Really felt like I’d turned a corner.
* Turns out milk of magnesia is a stimulant laxative and I’d overdone it (didn’t need so much because I wasn’t struggling to go, and it was soft.) Had the most painful BM of my life. It was 100% as bad internally as the transition stage of labor and externally felt like the “ring of fire” when baby is crowning. (IYKYK.) 10/10. Can’t believe I didn’t pass out.
* Switched to MiraLAX twice a day… not a stimulant.

Day 4: feeling more human again. Didn’t poop. Still not eating much. Still needing oxy but could go 5 hours between doses without too much trouble.

Day 5 (today): moving around more. Back on Tramadol instead of oxy. Needed to poop but colon just wasn’t doing its thing … probably because I usually rely on physical activity to get things going, and I hadn’t been doing much moving. Risked one 30-mL milk of magnesia dose. Got things moving and it was only about a 5 on the pain scale for less than one minute. I cried with relief.

**Conclusion:** And here we are! For those of you still reading, here are a few pieces of advice while they’re fresh in my mind:

* Spend as much time in the bath as you need. Pee in there if that’s what works.
* Moving around is really hard the first few days. If at all possible, have someone with you who can get water, meds, food, etc. for you. My partner has been an enormous help.
* If you can’t take anti-inflammatories, insist on something to relax muscles.
* Call early if meds aren’t working. They like to start with milder ones but should be willing to give you something stronger if needed.
* Although my bleeding hasn’t been bad, I was glad I bought adult diapers. More comfy than pads (which shift around so much… you don’t want anything moving / rubbing)  and easy to dispose of.
* Try MiraLAX before milk of magnesia. Although the latter is gentler than stronger stimulant laxatives, it still causes muscle spasms that, with all the other pain, were akin to late stage labor for me. Avoid if you can; take as little as possible if you need it.
* Have someone around while you poop at first — in the next room is fine — and have them check on you often. This was when I got closest to passing out.
* If you’re in pain regularly from your hemorrhoids, just get the surgery. These first few days really are hell … but they’re in the rear view mirror now. And I’m glad I didn’t put up with more months, years, decades of bowel movements often leaving me out for the count for hours or the rest of the day.",2,1767232346.0,hemorrhoid,2,1.0,False

My parents in their late fifties and are basically taking a look at retirement. They told me that I stand to inherit approximately $2M in real estate. We have an almost paid off house (approx $1.3M split with my brother) a plot of land ($1 M) and 2 floors in my grandmother’s mansion (total worth of $4-$5M they have 2 floors worth $1.6 M). Additionally I have a personal portfolio of $300k that I currently have access to. They also have their own portfolios. 

However, I’ve always been raised with a frugal mindset, don’t buy luxury to flex on people, don’t talk about money and there will be a time to buy luxury but not now. Despite attending multiple private schools and an Ivy league business school completely covered by my parents, I never signaled to people that I had any wealth. This resulted in me being subtly and not so subtly bullied by my classmates, ranging from people asking me why I used an Uber (can you even afford that?) to people offering me loose change to buy coffee. And it’s not like I’m dressed in rags or something, I wear sensible clothes (maybe not a Moncler but Banana Republic/Calvin Klein/Coach etc.).

I feel strange as to why my parents raised me this way. Why they tell me to be careful and I’m wondering if anyone was raised in a similar manner.

Edit : I need to clarify something, the house is mine to live in rent free in a year as they are moving back to India in a year to retire. Also the portfolio is mine. Additionally, thank you for the award! ",15,1767231978.0,wealth,44,0.78,False

After I ended the relationship, he wrote me a lengthy text blaming me for everything. He accused me of flirting with coffee baristas to test his loyalty and manipulating him with my acts of services. The list of rants was long! 

I am angry that I can't defend myself. I am angry that the only option I've been told by my friends, family, and therapist is to not bite the bait and to  just go no contact with him, which I did but it's not fair! 

I am burning inside with fumes because everything he said was untrue and pathetic! I want to tell him and especially his family how his son abused me, mentally, emotionally, and physically but I've  been told over and over to not respond and to simply walk away with dignity.

So I’m staying in a hotel and I was wondering what housekeepers like from guests. I like to take out the trash myself, I’ve been staying for a bit as my home is having repairs done. I have a few concerns though, its embarrassing but I’ve been having some issues with bleeding heavily and the sheets are really bad, I tried to use the hotel’s washing machine but it’s $6 to wash and dry bec I hate the idea that somebody has to deal with my bodily fluids. So I’ve been having trouble mustering up the courage to tell somebody (I have hella anxiety). I use pads but it’s been so heavy it bleeds through. there are some stains from coffee as well. I’m worried I’ll be charged as well so I’ve done what I can to clean them but they won’t come out. Anyway, I plan on telling her although I don’t think she speaks English so I thought about using google translate to explain and have her use gloves. I believe it got onto the mattress protector but it’s kind of a plastic thing so I’m hoping it didn’t go past that. I feel terrible. But I’ll request new sheets and put them on myself if allowed. I unfortunately don’t have cash to tip and I like to tip everytime they clean, no car and the atm next door is broken. ive been wiping down surfaces and everything else. So I’ll take out the few trash bags full of garbage to the dumpster myself, strip the bed when I leave, tell her about the sheets and request new ones.

Goodreads is a load of *Fourth Wing* manure.

...is what *we* disagree with, but for the sake of Gregg's sanity who *still* wants to continue this charade, we are required to acknowledge books who are swept away by Goodread's ~~Booktok's~~ popularity contest!



On a brief sad note, LadyElfriede, has now died.



She left this world due to a lethal bad dad joke from Raymond St. Elmo and now has gone to the great table merchant in the sky.

Before that happened, she has left Gregg and I, Keith, to host the Awards. ~~YOU ARE NOT FORCING ME DOWN THAT MANHOL~~E

She has also left a note for each winner, and I, decided it was very *uncouth* for people to be *savages* over a silly award.

No one is sadder than I, dear reader, that our good *colleague* Lawrence showed up in this category.

# The Best Indie Book



Indie books are a breed of their own.

They defy traditional publishers for the sake of it or hope to swoon a senpai in hopes they will choose them....in a maybe not so beneficial contract to the writer.

*Actually it was a little of a close call for Stang this year. I thought he would make a big sweep, though Klamvik with ""The Gentle Stirring of a Soul Beneath"" and Huie with ""The Sunset Sovereign"" got me feeling really emotional ESPECIALLY the latter.*

*However, Stang has under his belt a concoction of magic that, not only made me feel emotional, but makes you think of the broader picture. He turns the tables on you multiple times, and* still *able to pull it off after all these years, all the while.... kicking my manuscript into the fire while he blows on that damn pipe...again. Please keep your Sticks (TM) from Beatrix is all I ask.*

*Dreamcatcher was horrific, though I can't say I was actually scared, more like saying, ""ewww"" at an orgy at a weird time.*

*Though, without spoilers, a certain character had me bawling non-stop that my fiance had to keep holding me over and over as I tried to finish this. Firstly, with how I misunderstood them and being ashamed at myself for being a stereotypical human. I thought I was better than that. And then crying at how mean civilization was as a whole. If a book was the beginning of my villain arc, here it is.*

*King, though you'll never read this, or any of my future work in my lifetime, thank you.*

***Edit from Keith*** : She forgets that ""Fairy Tale"" also made her cry for the main topic of that book. Weirdly enough, King has only made her cry, never scared

# ""The Stick in the Rough""

>!Well, Keith took a backseat on the Feels Train after that last one, so I have returned. I do have a few questions of what just occured, where Keith found a manhole in my brain, why there was a table merchant in the sky, and how I got back, but questions for another therapy session. Though Keith had a few reasons for changing the Awards, albeit temporarily, we will honor his format for this year, with less snark. Sorry, Lawrence, you still got the brunt of Keith's wrath. Bronze Sticks are non-refundable and cannot be destroyed.!<

Nothing has to be perfect for it to impact a reader.

Huie caught me unawares. I knew it was going to be a memoir. I was not prepared how Huie dug her claws into me within the first few chapters and had me board the Train with Keith in the backseat, Vakandi in the front seat.

And there was no Rebecca Black, only memories.

She had a good way of making you visualize the past, getting attached to characters, only to realize, that all my friends are dead.

Good job, Huie, you earned the Stick this year... \*sniff\*

# ""What Happens if a Book Makes You Want to Run Away?"" Stick



For some context: I went hiking for the first time this year. I experienced something that could have been equivalent to a religious experiment (I know what I said, Keith, get back on the Train). Or to us agnostics, a vague god, that says, ""OK"" and that's your only sign for the next 75 years. 

Was it real? Do I run away in search of this mythical deity? What does it all mean?

***Can I apply the scientific method to this encounter???***

Anyway, existential crisis aside, this book deserves a new category. I was not prepared to talk about this series yet but, here it is, winning a Stick (TM) this year is...

This is book 2 in the Forsaken trilogy.

I say I wasn't prepared because I didn't finish the trilogy yet, not expecting to get T-Boned emotionally, and that hiking trip?

This guy somehow conjured what it means to actually *be* in a forest. Truly hear it's rhythm, it's heart, it's everything. Somehow condensing that into a trilogy? An actual story? Subverting tropes?!

I say folly! Either way, Cahan now has a Bronze Stick (TM) and YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HE DOES NEXT-

Barbara, who is probably the reason I'm still alive, has ask me to tell you this year, we did not travel to your ex-husband's dungeon. 

Which is to say, we stayed *the* ***fuck*** *away* from Booktok in 2025. So much of your soul and decision making can be sapped away in an instant there.

Kind of like your ex-girlfriend. 

This book was one of the last I heard from their screeches and rants that Biketok should get the Booktok girls >!Keith:....not realizing those ladies/guys are all married to some dude name Dave...yes, he has a barista harem....Yes, Laura, he's bi and I'm MAD that I'm not in it, but that's another story.!<

# ""The Goddess of the River"" by Vaishnavi Patel!

This book, on average, had 4 stars on Booktok and 3ish stars on Goodreads. A lot of them saying it was enjoyable but confused by the family names constantly.

...And here I started to think that, yo, ***I'm the problem***. I didn't look up the names and backstory of each character so that's the reason I might not have enjoyed it as much. But that's not the author's problem. 

This book, yes targeted to BookTokers, but also to South Asians that actually know the source material. That's when I realized....



Not every book *is* targeted towards me. 



It sounds dumb to realize this now, though it takes a lot of guts to admit this in front of reddit. 

With a considerable upgrade compared to *Kaikeyi,* Patel writes banger after banger of quotes. If you take the time to let yourself be fully immersed with this goddess' memoir, it's a guaranteed 5 stars, even if the names give you a stroke. Congrats, Patel, a Stick well stroked!

***Gregg Signs****: ""This is the first time two authors have shared the same Stick.""*



This is book 2 of the Pell series and it is written as if:

*-*

*Imagine if Terry Pratchett was actually American. He knows a lot of obscure references from the 80s and 90s and he writes like he's emotionally cheating on Stang and texting his side piece, St. Elmo, with a worldbuilding like he was high while watching Monty Python films. (I know I need to finish the Holy Grail)*

\-

That's what this series is in a nutshell. 



Not only was the main character someone I didn't expect, but the whole Fellowship were even more unlikely than the 1st book, if you can believe it. 

The 1st book is a *very* slow start. Though the reason I kept pushing was because I got the whole series and I had a sunk cost fallacy and I was losing...until I read the 2nd book.

If you go into this book with an open mind, not fight with it and nitpick, accept that the pace is slower than the US bureaucracy, you will like this book. Do not force yourself to read it in one sitting, it will not end well for both parties. 



***Dawson and Hearne...I beg your publishers to continue this series!***

[This book came out in the 90s, you're not going to get a high res cover, deal with it...I still forgot what that pig was](https://preview.redd.it/c2nv4q9usmag1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=9160d4db3ab6bfa85ce37c8a1ae0d354fc7285c8)

Yeah, um.

It's a good book. Might have levels of racism that might be akin to C.S. Lewis, but, I want to believe this dude has since matured a bit and is not like this in his new books. I care what people do in the present day, not in the past. But hey, oranges to eggs. Ice to water.

# ""The Best Graphic Novel"" Stick

I read 4 different manga series from various volumes and there was only 1 series that blew it all out of the water. (another was too soon to give a verdict)

Graphic novels don't just have to be Japanese manga. There is one from South America that is glaring at me every time I enter my closet. I have not sold it because I *know* I will read it some day just...Keith took my attention to somewhere else in my life.

The winner this year is....

# ""The Land of the Lustrous"" vol 1-9 by Haruko Ichikawa!

[I'm so worried, even though they're rocks, that their ribcage will snap in half D:](https://preview.redd.it/m4c5lw5etmag1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=401066086f82cadfa8f6a6c55587b830fcfbc9c4)

Let me start by saying, I loved the diversity that Ichikawa gave us by having genderless characters which is far more woke than anyone in the manga industry during the 2010s. >!SIDE TOPIC: It really isn't an insult to be ""woke"". What, so you want more diversity, people getting equality, to name a few topics, and THAT'S your insult you came up with? Really??!<

*The Land of the Lustrous* is set far in the future where humans are extinct and a race of gem-like beings are born, fighting back waves of invaders.

To say there's a main theme or topic, I would not be able to tell you as I have not caught up to the series yet. Because frankly, I'm just living in the Lustrous' saga. Not the present, the mythical future of our world. Go into vol 1 blind and see if it's for you.

# The ""Do You Smell Salt?"" Stick 

Double, or even triple meanings, are probably the theme of this year. 

Here, you may take it literally or figuratively. Both are correct and wrong.

Surrealism, salt, and fantasy go hand in hand, and this Stick honors that.

Congrats to the 1st winner of this category....!

# ""The Saint of Bright Doors"" by Vajra Chandrasekera

[In the exact opposite of cover spectrums, this one was TOO HQ that I had to shrink this cover down. Drastically.](https://preview.redd.it/dha0yxfwtmag1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=214cd23a6d146f88497efa656a054dfbae62a610)

Funny enough, I bypassed this book when I read the blurb on GR. 

*But Lady, he's South Asian!! Don't you circle jerk??*

???? 

I give light to POC of my same subcontinent, true, but what I bring to light doesn't matter color or lack there of. I only take a second look because white schools taught us a bias that only old white men mattered in literature*.*

False! >!I dislike ""The Office"" but I read that in Dwight Schrute's voice....I don't know either. Also I still carry a hatred of Shakespeare to this day.!<

Anyway, thanks to a person on this sub (I don't remember who, shout yourself out!) said that it was really good and I was like, aight, I'll give it a second look through.

Boi. I do not know if I'm horrified or joyous over what I read.

Am I smelling salt? Apparently, I rated it 4.5/5 during Spring... yeah, so, I think it's good(?). 

I'll let the ocean salt waves take me away, to the place I belooooong....West Virginia, water trenches, take me home....

Sri Lanka

# The Best Book of 2025



OK, I might have forgot, this sub rec'ed THREE books for me to read that wasn't a total dumpster fire.

And, bare with me, this will be a *very* controversial pick for my BOTY.

The Winner of The Best Book of 2025 and for the Bronze Stick (TM) is....!

# ""Interstellar MegaChef"" by Lavanya Lakshminarayan!...

[I have a big question](https://preview.redd.it/ooogl9ylwmag1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=3655e82fe490a0ed49401342a791e2023b36f6c1)



***SIR PUT DOWN THAT DONUT!...LEMME EXPLAIN***

\-

We live in a harsh reality that POC authors *are* judged harsher than their white counterparts. Usually over stupid shit. This book, currently, has an exact 3.5/5 on GR, but has WAY less name dropping than *The Goddess of the River*

The criticisms to drop the book are valid, however... you do yourself a great disservice to drop it to 3.5 or worse or even DNF it.

As a refugee to a futuristic human civilization, the FMC is in a world where solarpunk reigns supreme, everyone is equal, has livable housing, no one starves, and to waste any thing, ingredient or otherwise, is seen as barbaric. Forks and knives? The fuck you doing contaminating your food?

There are many themes and topics this book covers. Some on the nose, some less so. But, one thing the book *is* about is confronting people you *don't* like. (Funny enough, the FMC's bff is a giant jellyfish, the only likable being in her clique for awhile)

You will *not* like everyone you meet. That's just a fact of life.

It's the same with books. Sometimes, we just need to keep trying with certain books and people.

Books aren't always meant to be about likable characters. Books are supposed to broaden our worldviews, not narrow it. Likable characters get you more engaged, sure, and maybe a skeleton selling books won't make me have a new meaning to life, though your world closes more if you don't keep trying to open up your world.

....

But an important question reared in the back of my mind:

...

Solaris, you had so many food choices to pick for the cover.

*...*

*Why a donut????*

Keith, who despite sabotaging the Awards, came through to organizing this. He was the reason the Awards even happened this year!



Anyway here are your winners this year!

[Cook is just going to have to deal being stepped on. Wait.](https://preview.redd.it/fc7568uj6nag1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=d158a3b89d636962cfbdfdb6351a4e3036f01c49)

  
This format was temporary, so don't worry. Next year we will go back to normal. A lot of astral projecting, wanting to run away into a forest, and finding a reason to keep getting up takes a toll on a person. Anywho, I'll get back to reading and reviewing as usual in 2026.

Take care of yourself and look after one another.
