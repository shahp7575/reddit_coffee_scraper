1lvmrta,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReasonableFaith/comments/1lvmrta/defense_against_the_dark_arts_law_12_use/,Defense Against the Dark Arts — Law 12 “Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm Your Victim”,"The Set-Up

First week at the new job. A guy hands you a fresh coffee, calls you “brother,” and drops just enough personal dirt to feel real. Two weeks later he’s nudging for your contacts, your credibility, or your corner office. Same con, different cubicles.


---

Who’s Pulling the Strings?

Smooth-talking bosses angling for blind loyalty

“Mentors” who love the spotlight more than your growth

Romantic partners who weaponize affection

Business contacts dangling once-in-a-lifetime deals

Sales reps promising salvation in six easy payments



---

What the Tactic Looks Like

Selective truth bombs. Tiny gifts. Love-bombing. Calculated vulnerability right when you’re starved for connection. Anything to make you think, Finally, someone sees me.


---

Where It Shows Up

Onboarding mixers, dating apps, sales floors, family holidays—any arena where trust is currency.


---

When They Strike

Day one of the relationship. The second you’re lonely, broke, grieving, or riding a new-job high. Early and often, before reality has a chance to vote.


---

Why It Works

It hijacks our deepest hunger: real connection and hope. Counterfeit generosity feels like water in a desert—until the bill comes due.


---

Red Flags

“Too good, too soon” generosity

Instant intimacy without earned history

Nobody close enough to call them out

Evasive answers when you probe their past

Charm that wilts under slow, consistent accountability



---

Defend Yourself

Slow the roll. Trust should age like whiskey, not pour like a shot.

Track patterns. A year minimum before you hand over keys to your heart, your house, or your business.

Check their circle. If their only references are star-struck newbies, run.

Ask hard questions. Real character doesn’t flinch at daylight.


> Warning: Generosity and “honesty” are stage props in a con artist’s kit. Character is proven in the grind of ordinary days.




---

Kingdom Contrast

Jesus never buttered people up. He told the hard truth, let the rich young ruler walk, and fed crowds with no strings attached. Three years with the disciples before Pentecost—plenty of time for motives to surface, iron to sharpen iron, and Judas to expose himself. Pure gift, zero manipulation.


---

Call to Action for Believers

Don’t confuse charm with fruit. Wolves don’t howl; they smile and sign NDAs. Strap on discernment like armor. Test every spirit, every mentor, every “buddy who just wants to bless you.” In a world full of cons, be the one who remembers that real love carries no hook.

Guard your heart, keep your eyes open, and say yes to generosity that asks nothing in return—just like the King who died with open hands and no hidden agenda.",1,1752077380.0,ReasonableFaith,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old woman in the Midwest hoping to meet a man (35–45, single) who is open to building something real—even if we start with friendship and see where it goes.

I work in Accounting/Finance at a manufacturing company, and I’m definitely the “introverted extrovert” type: I can be shy at first, but once I’m comfortable you’ll find I’m sarcastic, dry-humored, and always trying to make people laugh. I’m an INFJ for anyone who enjoys personality talk.

I really love deep, passionate conversations far more than small talk. I’m big on growth—personal, spiritual, professional—but I’m also working on finding a better balance between work and fun.

Some things about me:
	•	Music is a huge part of my life (both listening and playing instruments)
	•	Avid reader and coffee lover
	•	Mental puzzles and sudoku enthusiast
	•	Occasional crocheter (though my perfectionism sometimes wins!)
	•	Pet mom to two cats, with dreams of someday having a dog when life allows
	•	Proud Auntie to 3 (soon 4) nieces and nephews

I’ll also be upfront about something important: I’m plus-size/obese, but I’m actively working on my health through better eating and home workouts. I’m looking for someone who is kind, patient, and willing to see me—someone good-hearted who can help me believe in that side of men again.

If you’re the type who values honesty, compassion, humor, and meaningful conversation, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me about yourself, your passions, and what kind of connection you’re looking for.

Let’s see if we can create something good together.

1lvmmku,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1lvmmku/collecting/,Collecting,"Hi all,

I got into DnD 5e late last year with a group of friends and it’s been a blast. Probably a year prior to that I had a friend from outside that group come over and he brought a bunch of other TTRPG books (mostly Mörk Borg) which I didn’t really understand or appreciate at the time. He lent them to me and I kind of forgot about them until I was several months into playing 5e and finally leafed through them with a better idea of *what* they were about. 

Since then I’ve been really into collecting all sorts of TTRPG books. Knave, Andrew Kolb’s Wonderland… my various online carts and wishlists are full of all of these books I feel compelled to own for some reason. I have my eye on Mythic Bastionland, Into the Odd, Cairn, the whole list of OSE books… the list goes on. My group is pretty stuck on 5e but I got them to play Mörk Borg and they loved it. I’m not sure I could convince them to keep adjusting to every single new system and we barely have time to play the couple different 5e campaigns we’re running now.

So I’m just collecting for the sake of it and it feels a bit silly. I reconnected with my friend who lent me his Mörk Borg books and we got to nerd out about the collection he has amassed. I made the same comments to him; that it feels sort of dumb to keep buying books for systems and games I’ll probably never run. He said he felt the same way but “they’re nice coffee table books or just cool to read”. I get that but I also think the only people who would pick up Electric Bastionland off your coffee table and read it are people who already are into TTRPG’s.

Anyone else just into collecting the books or am I going nuts filling my shelves? Did you finally have a wake up moment where you realized you had enough (or too much)?

Let’s normalize emotional intelligence — not emotional flooding.



There’s a difference between being open and emotionally dumping on someone you just met. Vulnerability is beautiful, but only when it’s reciprocal, paced, and grounded in trust. Too often, people mistake sharing their trauma upfront as proof of depth — but really, it’s just skipping intimacy steps and asking someone to hold space before they’ve even agreed to be in the room.



We’re building something different at With Intent — a space where emotional safety matters, and connection grows through mutual respect and timing.



Let’s learn each other’s coffee orders before diving into our deepest wounds, yeah?

1lvmemy,https://learn.pfasfreelife.com/research/pfas-in-paper-coffee-cups-risks-alternatives,PFAS in Paper Coffee Cups: Risks & Alternatives,"# PFAS in Your Cup? Science Says Yes!

* **Science Doesn’t Lie:** Multiple studies (including one from Sweden) have found PFAS lining not only regular paper cups but even “eco-friendly” ones—yes, including those lined with PLA, a supposed compostable bioplastic. Sneaky little thing, huh?
* **Everywhere You Look:** PFAS are so common in food packaging—think paper cups, wrappers, even molded fiber bowls—that finding truly PFAS-free paper containers feels like hunting for a four-leaf clover. Consumer Reports found organic fluorine, a telltale sign of PFAS, in over half the food packaging samples they tested.
* **Why We Should Care:** These “forever chemicals” don’t break down easily and have been linked to health issues like immune system problems, lower birth weights, and even cancer risks. So while your cup keeps your coffee warm, it might also be warming up some unwanted guests.

# Can PFAS Sneak Into Your Coffee? Spoiler: Yes.

Studies show that these chemicals can leach from the cup lining into your hot coffee. That means your morning java might be serving up more than just a caffeine boost—definitely not the kind of extra you want.

# Are All Paper Coffee Cups Guilty?

* **Mostly, But Not All:** Not every cup has PFAS, but the vast majority—especially those promising water or grease resistance—do. Even some “compostable” or “eco-friendly” cups aren’t off the hook because manufacturers sometimes rely on PFAS to meet performance standards.
* **Good News Alert:** There *are* PFAS-free disposable coffee cups out there! They’re just not everywhere yet. Your best bet? Ask questions and shop savvy if you want to keep your family safe.",1,1752076530.0,u_pfasfree,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for a place nearby that’s a reasonable commute, but I’m not very sold on living in Corte Madera, from what I’ve read it’s not really all that walkable and mainly a shopping district. We are both in our low 30s and ideally am just looking for something that’s really walkable with some coffee shops or small shops nearby. Our budget is around 3.5k on the high end, and ideally want a 2bd 1ba setup. 

I’ve looked at places in Larkspur, and have seen bad reviews on some of the available apartment complexes like Skylark. 

This might be overall broad, but does anyone have suggestions of some good rental apartments or areas in general to focus on that won’t be a horrible commute to Corte Madera?

1lvmd3v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvmd3v,World’s 3rd Keyboard With Built-in DAC – Made By Me – Wooden Case - FRL TKL,"As the headline states, the first mechanical keyboard came 2 years ago from an audio company, Moondrop, with the model name Dash in a 75% layout with their Moonriver dongle DAC built-in. The Dash had an aluminium case. 

The second model, KB3, came from FiiO, another Chinese audio company. The KB3 was also a 75% layout, with FiiO’s KA13 dongle DAC built in and has a plastic case with an aluminium metal part on top.

I used Moondrop’s Dawn 4.4 dongle DAC. Because it has the smallest PCB and high-quality sound worth using in my build. It has the same dual Cirrus Logis CS43131 DAC chips used in the FiiO KB3. Not far from the Moondrop’s Moonriver dongle DAC, which uses the slightly better CS43198 chips.

The idea was simple: to use a USB-C hub with two TYPE-C data outputs. But in reality, I couldn’t find such a device. There is not a single product on the market wich serves my needs. But I was lucky enough to find the closest option, a Type-C USB hub for smartphones with two USB-A data output lines.

I had to use a Type-C female to female and two USB-A to USB-C adapters to make it work, also to carve the case to fit it under the keyboard PCB. 

I used 4 silicone spacers to mount the PCB on 4 corners, and 4 shorter ones in the middle of the case to give the PCB a gasget mount style elasticity while typing.

That knob that you see on the right up corner is not a volume knob, its the mode selector for USB/WiFi/Bluetooth and its height unnecessarily high! I changed the knob with an aluminium one, which I sanded for an hour, for a soft touch feeling and brushed look.

For my luck, the Epomaker Shadow-X’s PCB is very interesting. It has holes for PCB-mounted stabilisers, so I was able to build a plateless keyboard this time. I know that to do this, we need soldered switches; hence, this is a hot-swap PCB. But I used 5-pin switches (Gateron EF Curry), so I managed to have that rigidity that I need while typing. I also used Gateron’s PCB-mounted stabilisers.

I used the PCB foam to support the switches, for both aesthetic purposes and sound damping. I like thocky/creamy and rather silent keyboards. So that was my goal.

I bought these MOA profile keycaps for this build because of the colours. I wanted a natural and organic, like wood, colour combo. Although my smartphone was not able to catch the true colours of the keycaps, they are light green on the Mod keys, dark green on the first (numbers) row, coffee milk colour on ESC, Enter, spacebar and arrow keys. And very light yellow on the letters. Like some Autumn colours. The wood I used is Turkish Walnut (two types of colours, for the body and the side panels).

Sitting back in my seat, I remind myself that four more hours. 

and the annual Alpha meeting would finally be over, and I can 

go home. Well, as long as Dad doesn’t force me to go to the ball 

and babysit Lydia. Dad loves to drag me to these silly meetings, 

even though I find them boring. Mostly, they just argue or boast 

about their latest business affairs. 

The meeting is held in the main part of Nightshade City, which 

is neutral territory. All the packs are on the outskirts, 

surrounding the city. So, it makes sense for the city to be at 

neutral ground because otherwise, movement within the city 

limits would be restricted. All five packs rely on it not only for 

business to thrive, but also to keep supplies coming in. 

I’ve spent all my school holidays in these sorts of meetings. 

Despite literally nothing important happening in them, my 

father has still insisted I attend even though my stepmother 

volunteered to go in my place. Dad, however, wasn’t having it, 

lecturing that I needed to learn the ropes of running a pack and 

how these meetings are a big part of it. 

I guess I am an accessory, and I’m one step away from becoming 

his fanny pack at this point. I’m already his notetaker, 

Chapter 1 

calculator, mediator, and coffee maker. He might as well just 

hand the pack over already. 

A few of the other Alphas have brought their sons and 

daughters**.** It is strategic on their parents‘ part, a way to 

strengthen alliances through marriages. 

However, I had no such interest, and it is clear I wasn’t the only 

one who wasn’t interested in parental antics. The only person I 

will marry one day is my mate, if I find him or her, that is. 

I often wonder what my mate will be like… who my wolf will 

choose… if I find my mate before Deacon marks me, that is. One 

part of me is conflicted if I should wait a year to see if I find my 

mate. Deacon wants to mark me once I get my wolf, we’ve been 

together two years but occasionally, I am not so sure. Finding 

my mate, that person who was made for me, sounds so exciting 

and enticing. 

I am brought out of my thoughts by Dad’s irritated voice. 

“This is ridiculous. Where is he?” he growls, smacking the table 

with his fist. Alpha Zayn is notoriously late, and as Dad had 

explained earlier, he doesn’t seem to care much for these 

meetings. Well, that is one thing we have in common, I guess. 

But that explains why I’ve never met the man, since he’s 

apparently too busy to attend. 

Chapter 1 

Maybe now’s my chance to slip out to the bathroom and not 

come back. Dad seems preoccupied enough with Alpha Zayn’s 

tardiness. I peer around the room, only to find the young man 

across from me staring. He smirks, and I bite back the urge to 

ask him to stop staring when he leans over the table. 

“Have you heard the good news?” Boyd asks. My brows furrow 

when his father elbows him harshly, giving him a look that 

seems to tell him to shut his mouth. Boyd leans back in his seat. 

and folds his arms across his chest, looking rather smug like he 

knows something important I don’t. Confusion washes over me, 

we don’t have much to do with their pack. My father never 

really liked Alpha Dane, who is Boyd’s father. I glance at my 

father, who is suddenly stiff as a board beside me. 

“Dad?” I elbow him. 

“Well, discuss it later,” he whispers back before diverting his 

attention back to the conference room door. “For frig sake, 

where is he?” my father snaps angrily, glancing at his watch. 

“Hush, Joseph, I would prefer no bloodshed at this meeting.” 

Alpha Samuel states, glancing at the other Alphas nervously. 

Rumors have spread that Alpha Zayn’s father met an untimely 

death, and the circumstances surrounding it remain quite 

murky. Yet, Alpha Zayn looks guilty as sin. His father goes 

Chapter 1 

missing, and he is suddenly ruling over the largest pack in the 

country. Yeah, that doesn’t sound shady at all. 

Dad groans at his words, drumming his fingers on the oval 

table. We are one of the smaller packs surrounding the city, and 

we rely heavily on alliances, especially when it comes to rogues 

and hunters. Without alliances, we would never have won the 

last rogue attack. It was sheer luck that Alpha Samuel’s pack 

was visiting at the time because otherwise, we would have been 

completely destroyed. 

That’s the subject of today’s pack meeting. Rogue numbers have 

grown out of control, and packs are constantly under threat or 

being attacked. Even the city has been targeted a few times. 

If something does go down at this meeting after my dad warned against it, I’m blaming the alphas who refused to listen. 

The double doors swing open as if summoned, and Alpha Zayn 

stalks in. The room stills, all eyes turning to him. He exudes power and confidence with every step, those piercing gray eyes 

taking in everything and the energy in the room, waltzing in like he owns the place. My breath catches as I drink him in. Messy dark hair, stubble accentuating a sharp jawline, and tattoos peeking out from his open collar. He looks like sin personified. Maybe this meeting won’t be boring after all. 

  
Chapter 2 

**“**Is there an issue, Joseph?” Alpha Zayn demands. Only then do I 

glance at my father, who is shooting a look of daggers in his 

direction. I kick him under the table, and my father sits back in 

his chair, folding his arms across his chest while shooting me a 

glare. 

“Behave!” I mouth to my father. Gee, now **I** need to tell him how 

to act! 

“Not at all, Alpha Zayn,” Dad denies quickly. 

Looking back at the Alpha, I quickly avert my gaze when I 

realize that me kicking my father under the table didn’t go 

unnoticed. Yet when I dare to look up, Alpha Zayn is still staring 

at me as if I am some puzzle he is trying to solve. He shakes his 

head and moves toward his seat. My eyes follow him to take his 

seat. When he does, his gaze finds mine for a heated moment 

before he turns his attention away, clenching his jaw. I feel my 

cheeks flush and quickly turn my attention to the huge board 

Alpha Samuel spent a good ten minutes writing on earlier. 

I swallow, not liking the way he is staring so intensely, and I can 

once again feel his gaze on me. A shiver runs up my spine. 

Thankfully, Alpha Samuel clears his throat, drawing his 

Chapter **2** 

attention away, and I let out the breath I didn’t know I was 

holding. 

My eyes wander around the room, taking in the tense. 

expressions of the Alphas as they discuss alliance strategies and 

resource management. All this talk about pack politics and 

territory borders is exhausting. I can’t wait to escape back to my 

life outside these walls. 

“Alpha Joseph, your input on the new trade agreement would 

be appreciated,” Alpha Samuel says, his voice cutting through 

my thoughts. Was I close to dozing off again? My dad 

straightens up in his chair, preparing to speak, but I can’t bring 

myself to care about whatever he’s going to say. Instead, I find my gaze drifting towards Alpha Zayn, who sits across the table, 

every bit as disinterested as I am. 

“Very well,” my father begins, launching into a lengthy explanation about supply chains and tariffs. I try to focus on his 

words, but it’s hard not to get lost in my own fantasies, 

especially when they involve the enticingly dangerous Alpha 

Zayn. His dark hair and the Alpha’s steely gray eyes make it 

difficult to concentrate on anything else when my phone 

vibrates on the table. I snatch my phone off to glance at the 

message lighting up my screen. 

Leaning down, I look at it under the table to see it’s from 

Chapter 2 

Deacon, making me grin mischievously. 

‘Meet me outside in ten minutes‘ 

I quickly type a reply. ‘You decided to go?‘ I reply back to my 

boyfriend. His reply is just as quick. 

‘Jailbreak, meet me downstairs! I can’t help the goofy smile that 

splits onto my face. 

I quickly reply, telling him I will find an excuse when my phone 

is suddenly snatched from my hand. I grit my teeth, expecting it 

to be my father, but I am shocked to find it is Alpha Zayn. He 

raises an eyebrow at me. 

“Is there something you’d like to share with the rest of us?” 

Alpha Zayn asks suddenly, his gaze piercing through me. My 

cheeks flush with embarrassment, but I can’t deny how my 

heart races at his attention. I shake my head, staring at the man 

wide–eyed. 

“Um, no,” I stammer, trying to regain my composure. “Sorry for 

the interruption.” 

“I’ll hang onto this until after the meeting,” he tells me, and his eyes flicker to his wolf as he peers down at my phone, reading 

my text messages. I reach for my phone, but he pulls it away, 

and I glare at him. 

Chapter 2 

“You can’t take my daughter’s phone,” my father quickly 

growls. Alpha Zayn merely glances at him before pocketing it. 

“I already did,” he states, giving me a pointed look. I turn back in 

my chair, and my father looks like he is about to leap out of his 

chair, when Samuel speaks up. 

“Joseph!” Samuel shakes his head, warning my father to back 

off, and reluctantly, he does while Alpha Zayn retakes his seat 

across from me. 

The meeting drags on, a mind–numbing cycle of posturing and 

politics. A few future Alphas sneak out, using the bathroom as 

their excuse, and no one bats an eye. The temptation is too 

much. Leaning closer to my father, I murmur, “Bathroom.” 

He nods without looking, and I’m out of my seat in seconds. The 

hallway feels like a breath of freedom–until I remember Zayn 

still has my phone. Fantastic. I’ll have to find Deacon and sort it 

out later. 

Heading for the stairs, I nearly collide with a tall figure. Boyd- 

one of the Alphas‘ sons, and the guy who’s been practically 

burning holes in me with his stare all night. His smirk says he’s 

been waiting for this. 

“Cleo!” he calls out, and I stop, fisting my hands and turning back 

to face him. 

Chapter **2** 

“You escaped?” he laughs. 

“Trying to, but you’re intent on getting me caught if we are 

going to be lingering outside the door,” I tell him. He glances 

back at the conference room door. 

“I’m not taking over. My brother is. No purpose for me in those 

meetings,” he says, draping his arm across my shoulders. “I 

heard your father is handing down the pack to you. I’m 

surprised it’s not going to Lydia, since Samuel’s pack is bigger. It 

would make sense if they joined packs,” he tells me. 

However, this time, I try to step away. I may not like having to 

attend these meetings, but there is no way I would let that 

woman take over my mother’s pack. I couldn’t dishonor her like 

that. 

“Oh, sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Come on, let’s get a 

drink. My father wants to discuss alliances with your father 

anyway. It seems we’ll be getting to know each other better 

soon anyway,” he says, and I stop in my tracks at his words. 

“Excuse me?” 

“Your father hasn’t told you?” Boyd’s voice is low, laced with 

intrigue. 

I take a step back, my heart picking up pace. Lydia’s earlier 

taunt echoes in my mind–could this be what she meant? 

Before I can press him, Boyd’s gaze sharpens, his posture. 

stiffening. I bump into someone behind me. Warm fingers grip 

my hip, the touch electric, igniting a shiver that races up my 

spine. 

Turning, I meet the intense gaze of Alpha Zayn, his dark eyes 

locking onto mine. 

I try to step away, but Zayn’s grip tightens, pulling me closer 

until every inch of his body aligns with mine. His fingers brush. 

under the hem of my blouse, igniting a trail of heat on my skin. 

“Shouldn’t you be in the Alpha meeting?” Zayn’s voice cuts 

through the tension, calm yet razor–sharp. Boyd freezes, his 

confidence draining as he meets Zayn’s piercing gaze. 

“My father… he said I could leave,” Boyd stutters, sounding 

anything but convincing. 

I stay still, caught between wanting to thank Zayn for 

intervening and cursing him for ruining my escape. But then his 

hand moves again, firmer, sending a shiver down my spine. 

“Good,” Zayn growls, his tone dripping with authority. “Then 

leave.” 

Chapter 2 

Boyd’s eyes flick to Zayn’s hand on my hip, his expression 

darkening. He steps closer, his hand reaching toward me in a 

weak attempt to assert control. 

“Cleo, let’s go,” Boyd says. 

My heart pounds as I glance between them. Boyd’s outstretched 

hand feels hollow. Zayn’s presence, on the other hand, feels like 

a storm, dangerous and impossible to ignore. 

Zayn leans down, his breath warm against my ear. “Do you 

really want to go with him?” ",1,1752076198.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

I can not for the life of me figure out how to get a date.

I have tried organically by joining local meet ups/clubs, being friendly/present in public spaces like bars and coffee shops (both solo or with friends). I have tried ALL of the apps, making an effort to make the first move - being consistent and friendly.  Whether I try and be confident and brave or if I try to be shy and cute… It’s like I am surrounded by an invisible force field.

Guys who match with me often seem super disinterested like our match was an accident or getting to know me is a chore. Guys in person often don’t engage in conversation with me or often hit on my friends instead if Im not alone. I don’t have a type, I don’t limit myself by height or looks. The only thing I seek is chemistry which I can never get far enough to find.

Prior to this 2-4 year dry spell I didnt have any issues meeting people and often dated. The biggest changes from then to now I can think of is I got rid of instagram and I gained a little weight.

Halos lahat ng kumakain doon is mga galing sa work (group) or by pair na mga mag partner na magkatabi kumain and facing sa pwesto ko. Went here galing gym kasi this Friday tinatamad ako magluto for protein ko hehe. To be exact naka 24pcs ako ng wings/drumstick.

Pros: 
The staffs were great, nag aask if malapit na maubos mga bucket mo if want mo refill and mabilis serving nila sa chicken and MALAMAN.

Cons:
Imo may times lang na slight to medyo makapal yung coating and ang dali makabusog. Also hindi masyado mainit or warm yung chicken, hindi naman sya ganon ka lamig pero most of the time hindi ko masyado maramdaman if mainit yung chicken.

Yung mga natry ko na flavor is yung mga recommend ng iba here and sa ibang socmed na nabasa ko

Garlic Parmesan- imo best sa natry ko from them hindi nakaka umay sakto lang yung flavor ⭐️🔟

Primos buffalo- tama lang yung spice level nya and tolerable pero natamisan lang ako nung naubos ko na kasi parang sweet n sour with spicyness sya. Although bagay sya sa dipping sauce pang tagal umay which makes it (6/10)

Primos Sisig- Unique pero nakakaumay siguro madami yung mayonnaise nung nagkataon iserve sa akin. Sakto lang ung anghang parang natapon na paminta sa lugaw type (6/10)

Jack Daniels- Unang kagat ko naisip ko masarap toh kainin sa bahay hahah. Amoy alak talaga sya compared sa 24 chicken, may pagka matamis lang pero may sauce naman. (6/10)

Salted Egg- Amoy at lasang lupa for me, im the type of person na inaamoy muna ung drink/food para maappreciate pero eto nauyam ako pero tinangal ko nalang yung skin/breading para maubos. (2?/10)🥴

Creamy Cheese- di ko masyadong malasahan yung cheese pero comparable sa cheese stick yung lasa for me (4/10 could be higher)

1lvm3cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lvm3cl/does_apoxcon_gw2_electric_coffee_percolator/,Does APOXCON GW-2 Electric Coffee Percolator Deliver? In-Depth Review of Features,"Testing out the APOXCON GW-2 Electric Coffee Percolator was an interesting experience for someone like me who starts every day trying to brew the perfect cup of coffee. This stainless steel beauty caught my attention not just because of its elegant design but also due to its promise of a more hands-on brewing approach. With its heat-resistant borosilicate glass knob and fully automatic operation mode, I was curious to see how it would perform in my caffeine-dependent routines.

**User-Friendly Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out was the APOXCON GW-2's sleek stainless steel finish, which adds a classy touch to any kitchen setting. It’s compact yet sturdy, measuring 5.9""D x 10.32""W x 12.4""H, making it perfect for both small and medium countertops. I loved the inclusion of the heat-resistant borosilicate glass knob on the lid, as it allowed me to watch my coffee brew. Watching the bubbles form while the rich aroma filled the air was oddly satisfying. Furthermore, the plastic-free and aluminum-free construction gave me peace of mind about safety, both from a health and durability perspective.  

**Brewing Experience and Features**  
Brewing coffee with this electric coffee percolator was a breeze. The on/off switch simplifies the process, and the built-in ready-to-serve light indicator lets you know exactly when the coffee is ready—a feature I didn’t realize I would appreciate so much. The automatic keep-warm function kept my coffee hot for hours, which was great during hectic mornings when I couldn’t finish my cup right away. However, a slight challenge was adjusting the grind size and coffee amount to achieve a perfect brew, as the percolator method is less forgiving than a traditional drip coffee maker.  

[Check APOXCON GW-2 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d1cdx943/)

**Capacity and Performance**  
This percolator can make anywhere between 6 to 12 cups of coffee, which is a game-changer when hosting guests or catering to several coffee lovers in the household. During a recent weekend brunch, it easily brewed enough coffee for four adults, and the concentrated flavor had my guests asking for seconds. One thing I noticed, though, is that the brewing time for a full 12-cup batch is slightly longer than I expected. However, the wait feels worth it, especially given how aromatic and bold the coffee turns out.  

**Upsides**  
- Fully automatic operation with an on/off switch.  
- Heat-resistant borosilicate glass knob lets you observe the brewing process.  
- Plastic and aluminum-free construction for health-conscious coffee drinkers.  
- Capacity to brew 6-12 cups, perfect for group settings.  

**Minus Points**  
- Brewing time can feel long if you’re in a rush for a large batch.  
- Achieving the perfect brew requires experimenting with grind size and coffee measurements.  

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing the APOXCON GW-2 to similar products in its category revealed its unique strengths. For instance, traditional stovetop percolators, while charming, lack the automatic keep-warm function that this one offers. On the flip side, a more advanced model like the Presto 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker boasts faster brewing but compromises on the aesthetic joy of watching your coffee brew through a glass knob. A more budget-friendly percolator option exists but often falls short in durability, especially when made from thinner stainless steel or containing plastic components. This one strikes a good balance between quality, features, and user experience.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Affordable quality is a key selling point for the APOXCON electric percolator. While it’s priced higher than basic percolators, the durability of the materials, combined with the thoughtful safety features and automatic keep-warm function, positions it as a worthwhile investment for true coffee enthusiasts. Cheaper options don’t typically offer a stainless steel body throughout or ETL certification, which underscores its commitment to both safety and longevity.

I was just wondering how to prevent it from cracking and the edges from falling apart when I cut into it. I had no other issues and it turned out great, the texture was correct and I followed the recipe as closely as I could, but it cracked in the oven in the last few minutes and the edges crumbled apart when I cut it.

I truly do not know what to do anymore and am on the verge of tears typing this.

In the past year he has destroyed pillows, our coffee table, legs on chairs, drywall in our kitchen, multiple door mats, shoes, area rugs, and most recently, our couch. He has also ruined multiple bed spreads and duvets with accidents. When we take him to the vet, he screams. No barking, shrill high pitched screams. I have tried crating him in a dual locked crate and he somehow managed to wiggle out of it and hopped over the 3 foot gate in our kitchen.

We tried training and explaining these issues and the trainers said he is “a bored adolescent” so I’ve upped his walks to nearly 3 miles a day (5am wake up so not in the heat of the day in summer), provide him plenty of chew toys and stimulating games for feeding.

We have added Purina calming care to his food 1x a day and have calming bites at the ready if he is alone with our other dog (3 year old pit mix) for long durations.

If anyone has ANY recommendations at all, please let me know. At this rate, I cannot leave the house to go into the office because each day we come home to some level of destruction. ",2,1752075657.0,puppy101,6,1.0,False
1lvm11u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1lvm11u/i_had_a_strange_dream_about_silksong_and_the/,I had a strange dream about Silksong and the Release Date.,"So last night I had this weird dream about silksong. The whole world had this weird blue tint like those movies. The area where I was in was this weird combination of a more rural late 1700 Paris and Illinois. But many of the people outside wore those caps like the ones from peaky blinders.

At some point the news came on but I had like this weird old tube tv that had the color and texture of the interior of a car I've seen in one of those YouTube videos. Like wooden but very luxurious in a way.

The news anchor was this older guy that looked exactly like that wold guy from the ""wooow"" meme and he had fingers of equal lengths. Like his Pinky and middle fingers were of the same length. Thdre were news of Silksong on the tv and how it was gonna release in August despite the dream taking place in october.

I then ran my fingers behidnd my ears and when I smelled them tgere was this very rancid smell. The rest of me was pretty clean. From a chair behind me fuukin Olgierd von Everec says ""wet behind the ears. Wet behind the ears""

Now I was pretty confused because we were in October and Silksong was supposed to release in August if that year but somehow there were news about it releasing. So I went on Twitter, but there was this weird bug that was also happening in real life for me, where no post would load if my phone was charging. I went out to get to my car, but when I got in, the chair was adjusted a lot higher. I had this strange feeling about it, and when I looked at the KM counter, it had like 90k more kilometers than my car. So i got out and saw this weird bit of red plastic around the exhaust. That wasn't my car. i went up the parking lot (which was on a hill for some reason) and screamed at my parents about my car. Then my cousin comes and says that she crashed my car and that she got me this one instead. I was just fuming. So much so that I felt the anger irl 💀 

But then Michael from GTA5 comes and says that he can lend me his car. It was that white truck he used to being down the house of that tennis coach (which wasn't his house).

So I took the car and started driving. As I was driving, for some reason there started to be snow around and the buildings began to only be old viking houses.

At one point I got down from the car and started walking through the wind and snow until I got to a Carrefour Market that was still built in the Viking style. Wooden with viking style letters spelling Carrefour.

So I went inside and it looked like some sort of bar from Stalker. With people in tactical gear and bottles of vodka everywhere. And there was this music playing. I don't know the name of it (I'll write it in the comments if I can successfully identify it with Google by humming it)

To the keft there was this mountain of bananas and some beches around it. A singer of Christmas songs from my country was there, holding a guitar.  So I went to him and asked him if Silksong was out. And he told me ""it's there, you can go ay ut there"" while pointing at a door behind him.

I went through the door and I was in this room with a hige TV and a king's bed with white silk sheets on it. The blue filter was gone and it was now a sunny dusk. The room had this huge windows and through them there was the view from Majula (dark souls 2)

So I pick up the controller (the game was running on an xbox one x) and started playing.

I was in the Lace fight and I jept dying over and over. 

After that a smoking hot girl in pijamas came in with a Platter that had a bunch of coffee cups and some croisants.

Then I woke up and the dream was over. Yeah it was definitely a very strange dream. My dreams usually have some sort of narative but this one was all over fhe place.",3,1752075649.0,Silksong,2,1.0,False

Juliet MacGregor’s family was evicted by the arrogant Marquess of Langford seven years ago. Now in disguise as a coffee house server in London, Juliet leads a double life—by day, she’s Meg Linton. By night, she’s *Lady Night Owl*, the anonymous writer behind *The Midnight Quill*, a scandal sheet exposing the sins of the elite.

Her favorite target? Beau Langford, the very man who destroyed her family.

Beau is determined to unmask his mysterious tormentor—but he doesn’t realize she’s the pretty server who’s caught his eye. When he invites “Meg” to the season’s most exclusive event, the Frosted Masquerade, it’s a bold rebellion against high society.

And it’s also when he falls in love with her.

But someone else is watching. Lady Forsythe, furious over Beau’s rejection of her daughter, intends to reveal Juliet’s secret in front of everyone.

Will Juliet’s secret be her ruin—or her salvation? And when the mask comes off, will Beau still choose her? Will she choose him?

If you enjoy slow-burn Regency romance with hidden identities, scandal, ballroom intrigue, and a twist of revenge, you’ll love *The Secret Behind the Mask*. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYG9S154](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYG9S154)",1,1752075639.0,wroteabook,0,1.0,False

I want to believe that the explosion of people DNing would naturally create regional or city clubs/hangouts that foster connections between DNs in a less coffee shop/work focused setting. And my guess is that they  would be ran or organized by people who are permanently installed in places that they may have  stumbled upon as a nomad (and grew to love obviously). It seems like it would be easier to establish connections with people living the lifestyle than to try and latch on to communities that are firmly rooted wherever they are. In fact I know many DNs who have chosen to trail with other DNs after connecting through informal channels.

I’m asking about the formal channels. Are we not seeing this idea come to light yet?  That is, popular cities creating spaces that specifically cater to people of the DN lifestyle?",1,1752075358.0,digitalnomad,0,1.0,False

Linda, one of my friends from high school is currently a store clerk. I have found myself having a harder time keeping in touch and relating to their life and struggles now. Linda and I were getting coffee this saturday morning, and she was complaining how crazy COL have risen. I totally agree, and I said ""I know right? My favorite horizon milk went from like 2$ back in the days to now 7$ for half a gallon""

She stopped and looked at me and said ""well you can afford 14$ gallons, you're too privilege to complain about COL, I just get the kroger 2-3$ milk for an entire gallon"".

I felt bad immediately and I stopped talking after I just said ""yeah, you are right. I shouldn't be complaining to you about money. I had just wanted to agree with you"". The rest of the morning was also awkward. I feel like I have to watch what I say around them.

When I eat fancy for 2 people, that's like 800$"" and I felt super embarassed. I don't want them to feel bad at all.

Hi all,

I’m based in Qatar with a background in fintech and scaling startups across different markets. I’m now looking to build something exciting from the ground up here — a SaaS company with real-world utility and strong scaling potential.

I’m especially keen to connect with:
	•	Developers / software engineers (frontend/backend/full stack)
	•	UX/UI designers
	•	Product-minded individuals
	•	Anyone passionate about building and launching B2B or B2C SaaS products
	•	People with experience in AI/ML integration into SaaS
	•	Entrepreneurs who’ve been thinking, “Why hasn’t anyone built this yet?”

While I have experience in product strategy, go-to-market, funding, and operations, I’m looking for technical partners or co-founders to collaborate with. If you’ve ever wanted to build a SaaS company but lacked the business/ops/scale side — this might be the right match.

📍 Ideally based in Qatar (or GCC region), but I’m open to remote collaborators with the right mindset.

Let’s grab coffee, hop on a call, or just throw ideas around. Whether you’ve got an MVP sitting idle, or you’re itching to bring a concept to life — let’s talk.

Ive been working at a small restaurant as a barista for about a year and a half now. I got the job through my stepdad as its his uncle that's the owner. In all honesty I've hated the job from day one but stuck with it because I needed experience and I had the sweetest regulars. 

My issue right now is getting into an argument with the owner this morning. As I finished college last week I sent him my new avaiblity for over the summer and asked him to let me know when he needed me in. This happened last week and I asked about updates every I was in (wed-fri on normal schedule) but he said he was still sorting it out. It gets to Sunday with no word from him so I message him, no response. Message again Monday, no response. I have no idea when he needs me or if he even does need me. 

I wake up this morning(wed) to a reply from him about how I should've ""known im on regular schedule"". I mentally lose it. I send him a few messages back and fourth telling him that I have had zero communication and that my avaiblity has changed anyway so I can't do my regular shifts to a T anyway. He blamed communication on him going away over the weekend (still not my problem) then askes me to vome in tomorrow.

This has really pushed me beyond the point of staying there. He's so horrible to work with and is constantly rude to his underage female staff and belittling them. He's made inappropriate jokes about me calling me a good ""fluffer"" (Google it) and how I was on my knees (cleaning the fridge) ""for him"". He flaunts his 3 cars and gifts he buys himself and then yells at us for not adding the extra 50p to have syrup in coffee because hes ""going broke"". He's left me 5 weeks without paying me despite constant texts and in work reminders. Moved me to work kitchen some days despite me asking to stay as a barista. Makes mess and complains im not keeping the place tidy (while im making food btw). And is just overall unbearable.

I'm looking for new jobs but the weight that this job is putting on me is too much. If hes in a bad mood everyone is. 3 members of staff left and he proceeded to get rid of 2 more so rushes are unbelievably overwhelming but he did it to save money. 

Is it a bad idea to just quit with no new job prepared? How do I cope with my current one? Is there any secret hacks to getting a new job? I've been out in person and applied online and nothings coming back.",1,1752074731.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,1.0,False

1lvlm3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1lvlm3w/new_partner_rant/,new partner rant,"So I’ll just go out and say it. I’m a new partner, and my first day was literally two weeks ago. 

On my first day my SM made it a point to pull up the diversity paperwork that I filled out in my own time (and had chosen not to disclose any information) and asked again that I “answer those questions for her”. So I just selected not to disclose my disabilities or gender for the company, because I know how that just benefits the company, and I’m not legally required to disclose anything for them. I am neurodivergent and it does come with its struggles, but I choose not to make it a point of conversation in the workplace because I feel it opens doors for passive aggressive behavior. 

But now she’s had meetings with me every time I’m clocked in about how I’m not engaging with customers enough, or my voice is too monotone for her uppity standards. She’s really concerned with engaging with regulars as if it’s Dutch Bros. She specifically said to me last shift that she noticed in my interview I seemed shy, and that it took toward the end of my hour and a half interview until She decided to hire me. But now she’s making that same thing an issue to be picked at, and my concern is that she should have taken that into consideration from the interview instead of railing me after hiring me. She has insisted that during my shift sometimes I just stand at the counter and make random conversation with customers as they wait for their order, which my first thought is who the fuck wants to see me standing wasting their time when I could be learning how to do the job of making drinks.


From the first day of training I have been entirely too confused in the learning process of everything, and I keep getting the feeling that the barista training me has way too much of a teenage girl attitude to actually care about walking me through the expectations of opening, stock lists, etc. The SM specifically said something about how my trainer is “one of the only ones she’d trust to train”, and she’s trained all the newbies, but the girl is entirely too vague in training someone who’s openly new to working at a coffee shop. A few days into my struggle of training and everyone is coming up to me and saying it took them 6+ months to learn things, and that they were trained by the same “trusted trainer”. I definitely have a small feeling that there’s a weird buddy ship between my trainer and the SM, but that’s another conversation.

I also just feel really left out of the loop of the team setting. I ask questions, but I feel like I’m just missing something. The first time I had to train on open, I just had to stand outside the locked doors and wait until my trainer arrived with the girl who was shift lead that day because nobody felt like telling me about parking or meeting before going in was a thing. Same thing next time I had to open was my trainer and the SM. SM texts me and says they’re parked by the broken meters in the town square that I never had a clue about, but it’s not for lack of asking questions or tips about parking. It’s just this constant feeling of being left out of the loop on things that would be really helpful. 

This also isn’t my first job. Nowhere near my first rodeo. I came to Starbucks after hearing other people around me share their experience with the job. I always made the joke that it felt like my friends who worked at Starbucks were a part of a cult because their jobs never seemed like jobs but like a little place they went and clocked in to chit chat with baristas, make drinks, and leave. But my experience has been rough, and I’m not sure if it’s just the not so glamorous side of a job or something deeper about my location in specific, or if I’m the issue. I’ve not had this hard of a time at other jobs, and I don’t feel like partners at other locations are held to the same standard this woman is holding me to at this location, but I may be crazy.

I’d appreciate any advice :)",0,1752074662.0,starbucks,1,0.5,False
1lvllta,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1lvllta/customer_dont_like_coffee_made_exactly_by_me/,Customer don't like coffee made exactly by me,"Hello, long story short I work almost a year at a cafe inside facility so the guests we have is exclusively a facility workers. Every guest is a returning one. 

We have two different coffee machines and a few baristas to quickly making drinks for our big lines.

One lady who I was polite with as usual and made her coffee at some times refused to drink my coffee today when she saw that I did it. She said that my coffee is awful and she can't drink that while asking my colleague to remake it on the other machine without even drinking it.

I didn't say anything and was angry and dissapointed by such poor behaviour on her part. 

The most weird thing is that I know for sure that she drinked every coffee made by me to the bottom of the mug in the past.

I make coffee for myself on that machine daily and I know that it tastes just right. I have no problem with foam or temperature. If I was making something so awful on a daily basis for returning guests for almost a year I know exactly that I would be said about such feedback.

Is this entitled behaviour on her part? To be honest, I don't want to interact with her at all and take her orders only to be told that she won't take a drink made by me. It's very hard for me to forget about such rude customers and the fact that I will see her daily will only make it worse. 

What would you do in this situation?

So we bought some step 2, 14mg patches. Stuck em on our arms and I just didn't even withdraw during all of that. 

So I figured itd be easy. It has not been easy. It feels like a million little goblins are in my mouth making salivate and vibrate for a hit. 

Its been two days, we are both wearing 2 patches for a total of 28 milligrams. We used to do the little refillable tapes, so it was about 3-4 milliliters per cartridge at 24 MG of nicotine per milliliter, and we'd need to refill it during an 8 hr work day. So we were probably on about 130+ mgs per day. 

After two days of no vaping and only using 28mgs per day plus a 4mg lozenge after meals and before coffee it feels very feasible to go down from here but its still so difficult. 

We really did no reading or research at all I just threw away our coils at the airport, I dunked our vapes in the water and threw them away all that fun stuff. 

Side note my fiance has pushed me to quit vaping so she was 100% on board with everything when it happened, she's more motivated than me and has been my rock.

1lvljh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lvljh2/does_the_vevor_water_boiler_eka32ed_meet_all_your/,Does the VEVOR Water Boiler EKA-3.2ED Meet All Your Kitchen Needs?,"The VEVOR EKA-3.2ED caught my attention when searching for a versatile hot water dispenser, and I’ve been putting it through its paces ever since. With its robust features and modern design, this combination water boiler and warmer is a serious contender for anyone who regularly needs instant hot water. Whether it’s for brewing tea, making coffee, or preparing baby formula, this device promises both convenience and precision. In my experience, it performs as advertised, but there are a few quirks worth discussing.

**Sleek and Functional Design**

One of the first things I noticed was how compact yet functional this unit is. Measuring 11 inches by 8.5 inches by 13 inches, it fits perfectly on my counter without hogging space. The polished finish in silver adds a touch of modernity, which blends seamlessly with my kitchen’s setup. The base, with its 360-degree swivel design, makes accessing it from any angle incredibly convenient. I found its heat-resistant handle especially useful when transferring the dispenser to a different location—no burnt fingers! Cleaning is equally painless, thanks to the removable lid separating easily from its polished stainless steel body.

**Precision Temperature Control for Versatile Needs**

What truly sets this hot water dispenser apart are the four precise temperature settings: 208.4°F, 185°F, 140°F, and 104°F. These different options made it a joy to use for various tasks. For instance, brewing green tea worked perfectly at 185°F, which kept the delicate flavors intact. Meanwhile, the 140°F setting turned out to be just what I needed for preparing my niece’s baby formula. It’s like having a barista on my counter. With 680 watts of power, the water boiled quicker than I’d expected, and the large 3.2-quart capacity served over ten cups, perfect for hosting tea parties or meetings with my colleagues. 

[See VEVOR EKA-3.2ED deals on Amazon now.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b0dgpqswpk/)

**Innovative Dispensing Options**

The dispenser offers three different ways of pouring hot water: auto-dispensing, cup switch, or manual dispensing. I tested each method over the past few weeks and found all of them reliable. Having the ability to manually pump water without electricity is a feature I appreciated more than I thought I would, especially during a brief power outage last week. There’s also a Sabbath mode where hot water can be pumped manually, which could be a game-changer for anyone considering specific dietary or cultural restrictions.

**Child Safety and Burn Protection**

As a parent, safety is non-negotiable. This product comes equipped with a child lock function, something I made sure to test rigorously since my toddler is extremely curious. It effectively prevents accidental burns or spills. On top of that, the built-in dry burn protection cuts the power automatically if water runs too low. Knowing that provides me extra peace of mind when using it for long durations.

**Premium Build for Long-term Use**

I appreciated the premium-grade, food-safe materials used in its construction. The 304 stainless steel liner, spout, and inner cover are rust-resistant and designed to last. While testing, I didn’t notice any odd metallic taste in the water, which is common in some lower-end dispensers. This gave me the confidence to use it for beverages, cooking, and even directly for my children’s consumption.

**Pluses**

- The 4 precise temperature modes cater to varied needs seamlessly.
- Functionality during power outages is a surprising bonus.
- Child lock and burn protection enhance safety elements.
- Sleek, space-efficient design makes it visually appealing on the counter.
- Easy cleaning with a detachable lid and smooth body.

**Flaws**

- The 5.3-pound weight might feel slightly cumbersome when transporting frequently.
- Its polished exterior, while classy, attracts smudges and fingerprints.
- The lack of an automatic cleaning or descaling system might inconvenience busy households.
- With most components being metal, surfaces can get unexpectedly warm after prolonged use.

**Rival Brands**

I’ve compared this product to others, like the Zojirushi Hybrid Water Boiler. While the Zojirushi offers similar temperature controls and capacity, it’s at a higher price point. The VEVOR model wins in terms of affordability without sacrificing key features. On the other hand, Panasonic makes a similarly compact water boiler that boasts better energy efficiency but lacks the 360-degree swivel design that makes the VEVOR more user-friendly. If you’re leaning toward safety for families, both Zojirushi and this dispenser perform equally well with their child lock mechanisms, though the manual dispensing option during blackouts gives the VEVOR an edge.

**Affordable Quality**

From my perspective, this combination water boiler balances practicality and price beautifully. Its features rival some of the higher-priced models on the market but come at a much friendlier cost. Considering its precision controls, safety features, and durable build, I’d say it delivers value far exceeding its price tag. Whether it’s for avid tea drinkers, families with small children, or anyone needing quick hot water for daily activities, this device proves to be a reliable kitchen companion.

1lvlg7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lvlg7s/mf_dead_dennis/,[MF] Dead Dennis,"*Dennis is dead, and it’s my fault.* The thought continues on repeat as I stare at my bloodied hands, his corpse at my feet.

*Dennis is dead, and what the fuck am I going to do now?*

Three months ago I was a recent college graduate with a computer science degree and a bright, shiny new job. Two months ago I was settling into my new gig, meeting my coworkers, and trying to put myself out there- a new girl in a big city. One month ago I was starting to get a little creeped out by the mailroom clerk who kept finding a reason to come to my desk, even without mail, and for inexplicable reasons, showed up at my neighborhood bodega. Twice. Now, I am a 23 year old woman who just committed murder because that creepy motherfucker Dennis wouldn’t leave me alone.

*Dennis is dead.*

*Okay, get it together Meg. You have to do something.*

I step away from dead Dennis, and make my way to my kitchen sink. I push the faucet handle up with the back of my hand, and begin to wash. A layer comes off and swirls down the drain, dark red at first but then diluting to light pink. My hands are still stained, so I reach for my dish soap, and think of greasy ducklings while I rub blue suds into my palms, my fingers, my nailbeds. When I am satisfied, I rinse and dry my hands on the tea towel hanging from the oven door- the cartoon image of a kitten stares back at me, likely horrified at what I’ve done.

*Time to call the cops.*

*No. Time to make a plan.*

Fuck the cops. Where were the cops three weeks ago when I called, frantic that someone was following me home?

“Sorry miss, unless a crime has occurred, there isn’t anything we can do. People are allowed to walk on the street, how do you know they’re following you?”

Well here’s your fucking crime, but dead Dennis doesn’t deserve the closure.

Here’s the good: I live on the first floor, so no stairs that I’ll have to maneuver. It’s past midnight, so the chances of being spotted are slim.

The bad: Dennis had 50 pounds on me, easily. Even with a first floor walk-out, it’s going to take a miracle to move a *dead fucking body.*

The ugly: dead Dennis is bleeding out all over my beautiful vintage rug, and it’s likely going to stain the hardwood underneath. It’s going to be a long, exhausting night.

I need supplies- bleach, sponges, gloves. And I’m going to need help.

I look for my phone and find it under the far end of the couch where it had been knocked away. A flash of memory roots me to the floor- me opening the door, expecting my pizza delivery. Dennis standing in my doorway, and then slamming the door behind him before I could react. Me pulling my phone from my back pocket, dialing 911, and Dennis grabbing my wrist so hard the phone flew across the room. My heart thuds in my chest as the fear washes over me again.

*Meg, focus. Call Hilde.*

I dial Hilde, my co-worker and friend, and I pray she doesn’t silence her phone at night.

“Yah, Megan?” Her voice sounds raspy with sleep.

“Hi. Hey.” I don’t know how to say it. “Um, I.. I need help.”

A rustle of bedsheets on the other line, a faint click, maybe a bedside lamp. “Meg, are you alright? What is it?”

“Uh… Dennis. He, um…” I stumble over the words.

“I’m on my way, I’ll be there in 15. Meg, it’s going to be okay.” I make an affirmative noise, and the line disconnects.

My hands shake in my lap as the adrenaline wears off and shock begins to take over. Hilde was the only one who believed me when I told her how creepy Dennis was being. She started six months before I did, and apparently he had been trying to stalk her as well. Shortly before I started, he showed up at her doorstep, just like he did with me tonight. But Hilde lives with her brother Mossimo, and he was the one who answered the door. Apparently Mossimo doesn’t fuck around when giving creeps ultimatums, because Hilde said Dennis never even glanced her way again after that night.

Being close in age, we made fast friends at the office, so when I casually mentioned the mailroom guy and how weird it was that I had seen him at my corner store, she warned me about her own experience. It was her suggestion that I find some kind of protection to keep in my home, and likely that same advice that saved my life tonight.

A knock at the door comes, and I jump to my feet, my pulse racing once again. It was too soon for Hilde to be here, it had only been a few minutes since our call. I slowly creep toward the door, and this time, I use the peephole. My body tenses, it was my upstairs neighbor, Mr. Gonzales.

“Miss Megan, are you okay?” He calls through the door. “I heard screaming a bit ago, I just wanted to check on you.”

A man in his late 60s, I had seen Mr. Gonzales in the hallway several times since I moved in. Sometimes he would have his grandchildren over to visit, which caused quite a bit of noise overhead, but he had always been so sweet with me that I found it hard to stay upset. During my first week he had brought down a basket of empanadas, his late wife’s recipe, he told me. We didn’t speak much, but I felt comforted with him living nearby. Now his kindness could be a real problem.

“Uh, yeah, Mr. G. I’m sorry, I was uh… watching a movie and it must have been too loud. I’ll keep it down!” I keep my eye to the peephole, watching for his reaction.

“I heard some slamming, and I thought something broke. Are you sure you’re alright? Didn’t seem like just a movie to me…” He trails off, his eyes searching the doorframe, maybe for signs of forced entry.

“No, no, I promise.” I lie. “I fell asleep on the couch and must have laid on the remote. The volume scared the shi- scared me as well. I’m so sorry, I promise I’ll be quiet!”

“Sweetheart, will you open the door?” His voice softens, and I wonder if this is how he talks to his grandkids. “Give an old man some peace of mind?” He insists.

“Oh, uh…” I glance to the left, where Dennis lies, right within view of the front door. “I’m sorry Mr. G, I’m in my PJs, you can understand. I promise I’m okay, I’m going to bed now. Goodnight!”

I watch as he frowns, looks like he’s about to protest more, but then just sighs and says, “Alright Miss Megan. You have a good night, and remember I’m just upstairs if you need me.”

I sigh with relief and rest my head against the door after watching him turn back toward the stairs. I can hear the creak of the old steps through my front door, and then his footsteps above me a few moments later.

I decide to wait at the door for Hilde. I don’t think I can take another jolt of panic, so every 30 seconds or so, I peek through the peephole to keep an eye on the hallway. Finally after what seems like an eternity, I see her blonde hair and her tall frame make their way toward my door. But she’s not alone- a man is with her. He is about the same height, but he has dark curly hair that falls to his shoulders- I wonder if this could be her brother.

She knocks, and says quietly, “Meg, it’s me. We’re here.”

I take a deep breath, knowing there won’t be any coming back from what happens next, then unlock my door and pull it open just enough for the two of them to squeeze through. I know that they must see Dennis on the floor, he’s certainly no secret, but neither Hilde nor her companion react at all.

“Megan, this is Mossimo, my brother. How are you doing?” Hilde says, looking me over.

“Oh uh, you know, just peachy.” I say, and nod behind them, toward dead Dennis, waiting for the fall out. For the gasp, the scream. For someone to ask me what the fuck I’ve done, and why haven’t I called the police yet.

But none of that happens. Hilde glances over her shoulder, and her eyes darken, but not with fear. With anger. She nods toward her brother, who walks over to Dennis and begins to inspect his body.

“Wait, don’t touch-” I begin, but Hilde puts her arm on mine, and this quiets me. For the first time, I notice that Mossimo has a duffel bag with him, and as I observe, he unzips the bag to pull out a pair of nitrile gloves and a facemask. He swiftly pulls his hair back into a bun, and then begins to prod at Dennis.

First he checks for a pulse- none. He checks for signs of breathing, and pupil reaction- none. Finally, he inspects the fatal wound site- I had lodged a pocket knife into his neck and drug downward with my weight to open a gaping wound in his neck and throat. He stands, pulling off the gloves and tossing them unceremoniously on top of Dennis’ body, then nods at Hilde.

She turns back to me, the anger in her eyes softening. “Did he hurt you? Are you injured? Does anyone else know?”

“No, I’m not hurt. He grabbed my wrist really hard, and threw me into the coffee table, which broke the lamp,” I say pointing nearby. “But I’m not bleeding, and I got him before he could do anything to me.”

Hilde takes my wrist gently in her cool hands and turns it over, inspecting the welts there.

“This will bruise, you will want to keep it hidden until it fades. Does anyone else know what happened here?” She asks again.

“No, just you,” I shake my head. “My upstairs neighbor, Mr. Gonzales, came down right before you got here to ask if I was okay. He had heard the commotion, but I sent him away. I didn’t let him in. I think he believed me.”

The siblings exchange a look, and my stomach plummets.

“Hey, he didn’t see anything,” I insist. “Please don’t hurt him. He’s a good man.”

Mossimo smirks, and Hilde turns back to me, stifling a smile as well. “Meg, we’re not going to do anything to Javier, promise.”

“Wait, how do you know his name?” I ask, suddenly aware that I might not know near enough about my co-worker and her brother.

“It’s a long story,” she says. “But Javier knew our father. He’s been a family friend for some time. He called Mossimo right about the same time you called me. That’s why we came so… prepared.”

My mind reels, trying to make sense of all the pieces, but too much has happened tonight. Too much adrenaline has coursed through my system, and I can barely see straight, let alone begin to parse how my upstairs neighbor and my co-worker not only know one another, but seem to be connected through a secret body-disposal club.

“Now listen, Meg. We need to know what you want to do here.” Hilde says. “We can go either way, it’s up to you. Mossimo will make sure that this fucking creep is never found, or if you want to go above board, we can help you get in contact with the police. If it helps at all, I can tell you two things: One, Dennis didn’t have any living family and his only friends were other online creeps just like him. No one will miss him. And two, he’s done this before, not to me, but to another young woman. She didn’t walk away, but he did. At least, until tonight.”

This information washes over me, and I wobble on my feet. Hilde grabs my elbow and leads me to the couch to sit. How close was I tonight to ending up just like his other victim? I think about how dismissive the police were a few weeks ago when I knew something was off, and my resolve hardens quicker than I expected.

“Fuck him. I want him to disappear.” I say, my voice laced with disgust.

Across the room, Mossimo had been standing with his arms crossed, but at my word, he nods and begins to gear up once again. This time with an elbow length pair of rubber gloves, a disposable smock, and matching items for Hilde as well. As they get dressed, Hilde tells me to go take a hot shower, no shorter than 30 minutes. She tells me by the time I come out, Dennis will be gone, and the floor will be clean. She tells me not to fret, that they know what they’re doing, and that she’ll explain everything I need to know afterwards. Then she shuttles me into my bedroom, and gently pulls the door shut behind me.

I stand facing the closed door, unable to move. I don’t give a shit about dead Dennis or what happens to him, but the reality of disposing of a body, of narrowly avoiding a similar fate weighs on my mind. I listen to the muffled sounds of my furniture being moved around and wonder about the situation I’ve found myself in. I’m not just a killer, though it seems he had it coming, but I’m now somehow associated with a sibling pair who just knows how to get rid of a body in the middle of the night. I muster the energy to walk to the bathroom and turn my shower on as hot as I know I can stand it. I place my clothes in a pile next to the door, not touching anything else, as Hilde had instructed me. I let the water pour over my hair and skin, and feel it begin to scald, but I’m okay with that right now.

As I shampoo, and condition, and exfoliate I try to work through how Hilde would know Mr. Gonzales, and the coincidence that they are all in my life at the exact right time. I rub steam off of the glass door to check the digital clock on my counter and realize I’ve been in here for more than 45 minutes. Surely that’s enough time.

My skin is bright red when I exit the water, and I wrap myself in my fluffy blue robe, tying my hair up into a towel to dry. I sit on the end of my bed until Hilde knocks again a few minutes later, as she said she would.

“Come in,” I call quietly.

She eases the door open, the smock and gloves gone. She’s also wearing plain blue jeans and a green long sleeve flannel now, a change of clothes from the all-black outfit she wore when she arrived a little more than an hour ago.

“Do you want to get dressed and come out to the living room? It’s all ready now.”

“Actually, I’d rather stay in here, if that’s okay?” I reply, and she nods. She joins me on the bed, leaving space between us. I can tell she is hesitant, maybe she doesn’t trust that I can handle this.

“Meg, we should talk-” she begins, but I cut her off.

“Listen, I want you to know that you can trust me. When I called you, I was already thinking of ways to… dispose of him. I never expected you and Mossimo to show up ready to do it all for me- I’m honestly still working through that part of it- but I don’t feel guilty for this, and I want you to know that I’m not going to say anything.”

“Well that’s good to know. I believe you,” she says. “But just in case you feel like flipping, remember how quickly we took care of Dennis.”

I suck in a breath and look over at her, surprised at the threat, but I find her smiling at me and she nudges my shoulder with hers.

“Kidding! Sorry, too soon?” she laughs. “Seriously, we’re not worried. We wouldn’t have come if we were. I should probably explain some stuff, huh?”

I nod, “That would be helpful, yeah.”

“Okay, so here’s the deal,” she begins. “Dennis has been on our shit-list for a while now. He tried fucking with me, as you know, and before that, there were several other women that he had been stalking. After Mossimo shut him down, we looked into him, and found out that at his last job, a woman went missing just weeks before he quit. Fit his type to a T- our age, blonde, slender. You get it. Her body was found about a month ago, and our family has a connection at the Medical Examiner’s office. You following so far?”

I nod my head, realizing that this goes far beyond just a couple of people who have a special set of skills.

“Well, our contact confirmed that male DNA was found under her nails. I had my suspicions at this point, so I swiped a coffee cup of his from work and ding ding- we had a winner. My family doesn’t take too kindly to threats, and if he had just been a creep, we probably would have kept tabs but let him walk away. But this guy Meg, he was the real deal. He’d done it once, we knew it was only a matter of time before he did it again. And then you told me he had been sniffing around you, and I knew we needed to do something fast.

“I had Mossimo keep an eye on you, to make sure you were getting home safe. That night you called the cops? It was Dennis following you, but Mossimo was right behind him. I know it didn’t feel like it, but you were safe even then. I made sure you got yourself a weapon, and while I was thinking more along the lines of a pistol, I’m glad to see you took my advice.

“Tonight, Mossimo made sure you were home safe, but Dennis had either caught on that he was being tailed, or he just happened to slip by. Either way, I’m sorry about that. We should have never let him get that close to you. And the rest, I’ll spare you the details. I think you can probably piece together that my family does things a little… differently, and I don’t need to pull you any deeper into that world than you already are. Just know that I’ve got your back, you’re part of the family now. Anything you need from here on out, we’ve got you covered.”

I let her story sink in, and I can feel the last bit of energy I have start to fade. I’m going to crash soon, but one thing is still bugging me.

“Wait, but what about Mr. Gonzales? How does he fit into all of this?”

“Honestly? It’s just a massive coincidence that he lives here too. He used to work for our father many years ago, but when his wife got sick, dad helped pay for her treatment, and then let Javier retire so he could be there for his family. One night when Mossimo followed you home, he ran into Javi outside. We asked him to keep an eye on you as well, filled him in about Dennis.”

It was all so fantastical, I couldn’t quite believe it. The right place at the right time, the right people all coming together to try to keep me safe. I yawn so deep then that it takes me by surprise, and Hilde helps tuck me under my covers as my body gets heavy with exhaustion.

“Mossimo’s going to sleep here tonight, just in case. He’ll be on the couch, but he will be gone before you wake up. If you need anything, or if you have any questions, just call me. And I’ll see you at work on Monday.”

I nod, but my eyes are already half-closed, my mind blurring into sleep before she even has a chance to close my bedroom door.

----

When I wake the next morning around 10am, my memory from the night before is hazy at first, and then it all comes rushing back. I throw off the covers and rip open my bedroom door to find my apartment nearly exactly as it had been, but with a few key differences- my beautiful vintage rug is gone, the side table lamp is gone too and the pieces swept up. The smell of chemicals hangs in the air, but there is no evidence otherwise that anything was ever amiss.

I go to my front door and look through the peephole, unsure what I am really looking for. I open the door to check the hallway more thoroughly, and nearly trip over a small basket of still-warm empanadas at my feet. A small hand-written note reads:

*Still here if you need me -Mr. G.*

I take the warm food inside, and lock the door behind me. As the truth settles in, that last night was real, that Dennis is truly dead and gone, I only feel a sense of relief. I won't have to look over my shoulder at work anymore, I won't have to fret about seeing his face appear next to the milk at the corner store. And even if I something like this happens again, I know I have people in my corner who are willing to do whatever it takes to help me.

I check my phone and see I have a text from Hilde:

*""Just checking in. Call Dr. Jenks when you get a chance, she will help you through last night. Another family friend. I left her card on your fridge. xx H""*

I place a few empanadas on a plate and get comfy on my couch, pulling my laptop toward me. I'm sure the time for working through my trauma will come sooner rather than later, but for now I open up Marketplace and begin my most important task of the day:

Last Friday I ate some frozen pizza and had a beer, just chilling out cause my wife was gone for the weekend. Within 30 minutes I had crazy stomach pain which isnt super unusual for me but I had nausea which was odd and the usual stuff (heat pad, pepto, etc) didn't work. This went on for a few hours until I threw up, at which point the pain was better and I could sleep. Throughout the weekend I had a constant low intensity burning sensation in my lower abdomen, and barely ate anything. I will note that I did drink coffee and had one beer when I was feeling a bit better, which didn't seem to make my symptoms any worse. Anyway, when I was feeling okay-ish the following Monday I ate some eggs and a bagel and almost immediately had the same response but worse, with pain, nausea, tingling that radiated from my hands and feet to my chest, weakness, shortness of breath. I vomited, and I thought I was actually going to pass out and possibly die. Wife took me to the ER, where they put me on fluids and anti nausea and ran blood work. My blood came back with elevated white blood cells, hemoglobin, high neutrophil %, and very high lipase (2500). Got a CT and ultrasound which didn't show anything abnormal including my pancreas. I stabilized off the IV fluids and convinced them to let me go home, and since then I've been recovering by slowly reintroducing foods and tons of liquids with no relapse. Sorry for the long post, just wanted to share my story in case anyone has experienced something similar. Really appreciate any help or advice this community might have for me!

1lvlba6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1lvlba6/reclaiming_your_time_and_energy/,Reclaiming Your Time and Energy,"A Roadmap to Genuine Happiness

Introduction  
In today’s fast-paced world, time and energy are our most precious—and most fleeting—resources. We juggle work deadlines, family responsibilities, social engagements, and the constant ping of digital notifications. All too often, we find ourselves exhausted, stressed, or simply going through the motions. But what if we shifted course and deliberately devoted our hours and effort only to the activities, people, and pursuits that truly elevate our well-being? This blog explores why and how to spend your time and energy on what makes you happier—and how that choice can transform your life.

1. Recognize Time and Energy as Finite Resources  
  • Time is irreplaceable. Once a moment passes, you can’t get it back.  
  • Energy governs everything you do. Physical fatigue, mental burnout, or emotional depletion all limit your ability to enjoy life.  
  • Mindset shift: Treat both as investments. Ask: “Is this activity earning dividends in my happiness bank?”

2. Identify Your Personal Happiness Drivers  
  A. Reflect on Past Peaks  
    – Recall days when you felt energized, engaged, and content. What were you doing? Who were you with?  
  B. Core Values Inventory  
    – List your top 5 values (e.g., creativity, connection, growth, contribution, freedom).  
    – Rate your daily activities against these values: Which align? Which clash?  
  C. Experimentation  
    – Try out new hobbies, volunteer roles, or social events as “test drives.” Keep what resonates; drop what drains.

3. Conduct a Time-Energy Audit  
  • For one week, track how you spend your hours and how you feel afterward (energized, neutral, drained).  
  • Identify “energy leaks”: activities or obligations that consistently leave you depleted with little payoff (endless social media scrolling, toxic relationships, low-value meetings).  
  • Pinpoint “energy boosters”: anything from a brisk morning walk to a coffee catch-up with a supportive friend.

4. Declutter Your Life: Reduce or Eliminate Energy Drains  
  A. Learn to Say No  
    – Politely decline meetings, tasks, or events that don’t align with your priorities.  
    – Frame refusals positively: “I’m focusing right now on ___, so I can’t commit to ___.”  
  B. Set Digital Boundaries  
    – Schedule “no-screen” blocks each day.  
    – Turn off nonessential notifications; practice single-tasking.  
  C. Protect Your Environment  
    – Tidy or reorganize your workspace and living areas. A clutter-free zone conserves mental energy.

5. Intentionally Invest in Energy Boosters  
  A. Physical Self-Care  
    – Regular exercise: even 15 minutes of movement raises endorphins and sharpens focus.  
    – Sleep hygiene: prioritize 7–9 hours; create a wind-down routine.  
    – Nutrition and hydration: balanced meals and sufficient water fuel both body and mind.  
  B. Mental and Emotional Nourishment  
    – Mindfulness or meditation: cultivate presence, reduce rumination, build resilience.  
    – Journaling: process thoughts, celebrate wins, chart progress.  
    – Creative outlets: painting, writing, music—activities that absorb and uplift you.  
  C. Social Connection  
    – Deep conversations with close friends or mentors often recharge more than large gatherings.  
    – Schedule regular “connection rituals”: weekly phone calls, monthly dinners, or shared classes.  
  D. Personal Growth  
    – Dedicate time to learning—online courses, books, or workshops on topics you care about.  
    – Setting small challenges or goals builds confidence and satisfaction.

6. Build Sustainable Habits and Routines  
  • Micro-Habits: Start small (e.g., two minutes of meditation, five pages of reading). Gradually scale up.  
  • Habit Stacking: Attach a new positive habit to an existing routine (e.g., journal right after your morning coffee).  
  • Accountability: Buddy up, use habit-tracking apps, or share your goals publicly to stay on course.

7. Review and Adjust Regularly  
  • Every month, revisit your time-energy audit. What’s changed?  
  • Celebrate improvements: more stress-free weekends, increased creative output, deeper relationships.  
  • Tweak or prune activities that no longer serve your evolving happiness profile.

Conclusion  
By treating time and energy as precious assets and investing them mindfully in the pursuits that uplift you, you create a positive feedback loop: greater well-being begets more vitality, creativity, and joy. Start small—identify one energy leak to eliminate and one happiness booster to adopt this week. With consistent effort and reflection, you’ll find yourself leading a richer, more fulfilling life—one purpose-driven moment at a time.

**Why This Pick?** 

Arizona starter Brandon Pfaadt (5.42 ERA) has been synonymous with high-scoring games, but to be frank, both of today’s pitchers have been shaky on the mound; comically, Pfaadt is the more reliable of the two at 8-6. Starter Dylan Cease (4.62 ERA, 3-8) has allowed 2 Home Runs in each of his last 2 starts, and the Padres offense has been a cricket choir for what feels like eons now. If Cease continues to give up HRs the way he has been, this should be an easy Over for the Diamondbacks. I’m on Arizona to bag the runs today.

my boyfriend (20m) and i (20f) have been together for almost three years, and we moved in together about three months ago. our relationship has always been strong, and living together has actually brought us even closer.

lately, though, i’ve noticed a shift that’s been bothering me. when i try to initiate intimacy, he tends to ignore or brush it off. i asked him what turns him on or what i can do to help him get in the mood, since i used to just straight up grab ""it"", but he told me it made him uncomfortable so i stopped. he told me i could rub his chest or lower stomach, or kiss his neck, but it doesn't do anything. he just doesn't respond to it so i stop.

I asked him again what i could do, and he told me that it just needs to “come naturally to him.” to me, that sounds like i shouldn’t initiate anything and should just wait until he’s in the mood, which makes me feel a little lost.

i asked if he thought he had a low sex drive because i have a pretty high one and i’m almost always the one initiating nowadays. he said he doesn’t think he does, he just believes his drive will come back with time. i didn’t want to push the conversation too hard since he seemed uncomfortable, and we usually communicate really well, so i tried to give him space.

but it’s been messing with my self-esteem. when we first moved in, we were still intimate every other day or so, and now sometimes three or four days go by without anything. i know that’s not a long time for some people, but for me, it feels like a shift. i don’t even get a reaction from him when we shower together. i’m someone who’s always been really confident and comfortable in my skin, so this feels like shit. i just want to feel needed, craved, like he wants me.

for more context, i really do try to be a good partner. i never get upset when he wants alone time, whether it’s for games, the gym, or hanging out with his friends. i don’t blow up his phone, i make him coffee every morning, i bring him small surprises just because, and i do my best to support him with work and things he loves. i enjoy my alone time as well, so it's never bothered me. i don’t think i’m doing anything wrong, but this change is starting to make me question myself.

if i were on the outside reading this, i might assume the guy was cheating, but i truly don’t believe that’s the case. our relationship is emotionally healthy and solid, and i trust him. i’m just looking for some advice or insight. i want to understand what might be going on without jumping to conclusions, and figure out how to navigate this in a way that doesn’t leave me feeling rejected or like i have to silence my own needs.",2,1752073936.0,relationship_advice,15,0.67,False

I take supplements. But the more I added to my routine, the more I realized how complicated it could be to build the perfect schedule. Some work better together, some (rarely) interact negatively, some break a fast, others need to be taken on an empty stomach… It quickly became a puzzle.

So I built an app to help me figure it out.

You just enter your supplements, and it generates the optimal schedule based on your fasting window, meal times, and the best timing for each compound. Then, you can log your intake as you go.

I’ve put **hundreds of hours** into building this. When I first shared it here, more than **5,000 of you downloaded it**. Many of you sent feedback, shared ideas, and helped me improve it — so thank you. That meant a lot

**If you’re from Reddit, it’s completely free** for the entire time the app is in development. This project wouldn’t exist without this community.

# 🔥 Recent updates:

✅ **50+ new supplements added** (database now close to 100)

✅ New **Timeline View**: a visual schedule of your day with smart anchors like breakfast, lunch, bedtime — and soon, workout or coffee.

✅ Tap any placement to understand **why** it’s there: based on ideal timing, synergies, interactions, and your own routine.

✅ Tons of AI improvements. The engine is now way more accurate. (If anything looks weird — let me know!)

# 🚀 Coming next:

• Track how supplements affect sleep, mood, focus…

• Correlation insights: *“Your sleep is 14% better on magnesium days”*

• Sync with Apple Health & Whoop (early stage!)

• Custom supplements & dosages recommendations

If something you take isn’t in the app yet — just DM me, I’ll add it manually.

I just wanted to share where the project’s at. It’s been super fun to build, and I’m genuinely trying to make it the best tool out there for supplement nerds like me.

I’m a pretty independent and self-sufficient person. I’ve had anxiety and OCD since I was a kid, and while the OCD got worse as I got older, I started doing Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), which helped a lot.



These days, the “symptoms” are fairly manageable. Occasionally, I’ll get a random intrusive thought—like if I step on a crack, I’ll think, “Well, now your coffee’s going to suck,” or “something bad will happen,” etc. I usually just let the thought pass. Honestly, I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t have the energy to care, and weirdly, that’s what helps it lose power. The anxiety shows up, but it fades pretty quickly when I don’t feed it. 

That said, when I’m stressed or triggered, it can still get to me.

This past weekend, I tried microdosing psilocybin—0.3g one day and 0.5g the next—and I felt genuinely calm and happy. What surprised me most is that, even a few days later, I still don’t feel anxious. It’s like the usual mental “noise” has quieted. I’m not sure what to make of it yet, but it’s been a noticeable shift.

1lvl168,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1lvl168/alternate_day_fasting_it_works_for_me/,Alternate Day Fasting - It works for me,"Hello Reddit,

Growing up I was naturally thin, but once I became an adult, I started putting on weight. At most I was about 40 pounds above my ideal weight. I wanted to share what works for me in case it helps anyone else trying to lose weight. I'm male and in my late 40's.

Disclaimer: I am NOT a doctor and this in NOT medical advice.

The method that works for me is called ""Alternative Day Fasting"", and is described in the book ""The Alternate Day Diet"" by [James B. Johnson M.D.](https://www.amazon.com/James-B-Johnson-M-D/e/B001JRREO8/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1) and  [Donald R. Laub](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_2?ie=UTF8&field-author=Donald+R.+Laub&text=Donald+R.+Laub&sort=relevancerank&search-alias=books).

I have no connection to this book besides reading it and benefitting from it. The last time I used this method, a few months ago, I lost about 10 pounds in 4 weeks (from 215 lbs to 205 lbs).

The basic idea is:

Day 1: You have a ""hungry"" day where you only consume around 20% of your normal daily calorie requirements. For me, that meant eating breakfast but nothing after (no lunch or dinner). I drink a lot of water during the day, regular tap water or Gerolsteiner mineral water to have some variety. I also drink coffee with a small amount of milk and sugar added.

Day 2: Eat whatever you want! Of course, I eat more than normal the next day but not by a large amount. At most, I have three ""hungry days"" a week, always followed by a ""eat whatever I want"" day. And it works!

Why I like it:

For me, it has been easier to skip meals rather than consistently eat small meals. I also intensely dislike all forms of fake sugar and ""fake"" food that is meant to fill you up but doesn't have any calories. The hardest part isn't the hunger, it's my family offering me food and feeling sorry for me! But I try to tell them, it's better for me to not eat anything for the meals I'm skipping, instead of trying to eat a small amount and get voraciously hungry.

Going to sleep hungry can be a challenge too, but I've gotten used to it.

I also try to exercise three times a week. It's not a requirement for fasting though (and actually, ironically, makes me more hungry!).

Again, I'm not a doctor and not trying to provide medical advice. I'm posting this because there are lots of diets out there and most of them seem to be expensive and have terrible side effects, like the weight loss medications. I would not say this method is ""easy"", but I always have a great feeling when I wake up the next day after the ""hungry"" day knowing I can eat what I want, or stepping on the scale and see that a few pounds have come off.

Best of luck to everyone with your weight loss goals!",2,1752073298.0,AlternateDayFasting,4,1.0,False

Grab a coffee or popcorn because this is hellaaaa long.

  
I (F19, a broke college student) have been working at a cotton candy shop for about two weeks. So far, I've been working hard and even got praise from my coworkers (probably because I was new and insecure) but I wouldn't say my work was half-assed.

Now this week. Oh boyyy. It was a roller-coaster of a coworker not acting like her minimum wage. Let's name her Allen. Allen has been working for about four weeks so she is as new as me. Note to myself and others ; **coworkers are not your friends**. But I still treated her like one, we were really friendly to each other, and felt safe asking for her help. At some point, I wanted tips for opening the store since this would be my first time this Tuesday and she has done it before. She told me to ask the manager for help since she is not one, which is fair (remember this).

Now Monday, my manager changed my schedule. Let's call him Diddi. Diddi asked me to come later (10 am) Tuesday so that means I won't be opening. Apparently, Allen will do the opening (9 am). You usually only need one to do that. So I accept since more sleep time for me.

Tuesday. I'm on my way and she is texting me with an eagerness to see me. I answer casually and when I get to my workplace, she tells me (big emphasis on the emphasis) : « You know you are REALLY late?» 

Didn't like the way she talked to me. I was indeed not late, it was 9:40 am. But I also assumed she was like that because 1. she was the supervisor for the first time and only for today and 2. she probably didn't know my schedule change. So I tell her that my schedule changed and she says : « Well, the manager didn't tell me. It was your responsibility to announce it to me. I was ready to show you how to do the opening. »

Did I look at her with fish eyes? Absolutely because ain't no fucking way. Two things are so wrong with what she said. First, was it really my responsibility to tell her the manager' changes (need your input)? Secondly, is she pissed of because she waited for me (didn't ask her to) to show how to do the opening? From what I've read, she did tell me to go tell the manager how to do it. And that she ain't a manager. Two plus two equal four. But I did not talk back. Eventually, I will. I agreed along with her and she immediately went friendly on me.

Nowww. I look at my phone while I was preparing myself and I see she wrote me a long ass paragraph telling me « I do not take my job seriously. » Insert meme looking at the camera confused with ??? all around. This pissed me off so bad but I still did not talk about it. I wanted to finish my shift quick and fast. I just assumed she was right to feel pissed because the manager forgot to manage and tell her my schedule.

My shift starts and I defrost cotton candies (yeah, I know). She tells me to not do that now and that I should go and make the cotton candies instead. I do as I am told. While I was making the cotton candies, the big boss, owner of this damn shop, comes up to me and asks me in a condescending tone what the fuck am I doing. Well, if you have fucking eyes, I am currently making overpriced cotton candies for little kids. I did not say that. He tells me, still in a condescending tone : « You making cotton candies for which customers? Where are the customers? They will get all soggy because of you. You should be defrosting instead.» I make a face. I tell him the supervisor tasked me this and you know what this two faced said? She said she did not say that. SHE DID NOT SAY WHAT? And told him it was just all a confusion on both parties. Well, I am damned. He did not even apologize for his stupid ass tone and just went on a rant ON ME ONLY how stupid my decision was.

When he leaves, obviously I get mad and call him an asshole. Allen hears it. We getting into it, now.

When my shift was done and I got home, I immediately started writing my resignation letter. This all felt like a conspiracy against me for some reasons lol. And while I was doing that, I texted my manager to tell him it would be appreciated if he tells Allen (since she wanna know so bad) about any schedule changes, as it was NOT my responsibility. Now this fuckass Diddi basically tells me it's my own fault and I shouldn't give attitude. WHAT ATTITUDE SIR. We were on DISCORD texting this. And he changes the subject to make me even more worst by telling me « Everybody loves our boss. You shouldn't call him an asshole. If you think like that, you might as well reconsider the job.» What if you start reconsidering your life. Anyway, I was confused because it has no correlations. He gets all defensive and that was it. My angry French side took over me (you probably noticed with the «» lol).

My resignation letter drastically changed. We usually need to give a two weeks notice but I decided I wouldn't do that by fear of a hostile workplace environment for being a snitch. Hell yeaah. I basically write down the racists comments from my coworkers (about Asians, how they don't like serving Black families, and how they hate Italians), how Allen decides to snitch on me for every mistakes I do (not mentioned in this post, but had happened) but will hide evidences when her friends do not respect food sanitary rules, and so on. Sent. Blocked my manager on discord because he wanted to continue the conversations on this not so professional app. 

Then I wrote to Allen. I wrote everything in French out of spite because for some reasons, they only know English in a French region. How she has treated me like I'm some kind of fool, disrespected my work, her two faced attitude. It was all done with elegance, do not worry. I believe.

Anyway. Funniest thing is that I will get frowned upon for calling out what everybody thought : the boss is an asshole. Not so funny thing, it will be me against a bunch of already friends (yes, manager, boss, supervisor and lots of coworkers are friends) for my own damn rights. And still, I only feel bad for calling the boss an asshole. We are currently Wednesday so I might have updates soon, if anybody is interested in my case.

The tile counters have held up, but I’m ready for solid surface. I’d like to remove the island step up, switch to induction, and possibly keep the custom maple cabinets.

1lvl0k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lvl0k2/does_technivorm_moccamaster_kbgv_select_coffee/,Does Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select Coffee Maker Live Up to the Reviews?,"The Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 KBGV Select Coffee Maker caught my attention recently, and I’ve been putting it through its paces every morning in my own kitchen. This sleek, 10-cup drip coffee maker in a stunning Juniper color is a real head-turner on the countertop. As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast, I’m always on the lookout for products that can deliver the holy grail: a perfect cup of coffee every time. But of course, as with any product, it came with both highs and a few hiccups.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The external finish of the coffee maker is one of its standout features. That Juniper shade is seriously classy and blends well with modern kitchen aesthetics. Its dimensions—6.5"" depth, 12.75"" width, and 14"" height—mean it fits nicely under most cabinets, without being overwhelmingly bulky. It’s not just pretty, though. The materials feel solid, and the unit has a reassuring heft at 8.18 pounds. The glass carafe is substantial, and the hotplate seems thoughtfully designed to keep coffee warm without burning it. I also appreciated the frustration-free packaging, which made the unboxing process a breeze. 

**Ease of Use**  
What struck me immediately was how intuitive everything felt. Operating the Moccamaster is as simple as pressing one button. The brew-volume selector is a practical feature, allowing you to choose between a half carafe or the full 40 ounces. This flexibility suits lazy solo mornings or bustling family brunches equally well. Nothing frustrates me more than a slow brew, but this machine delivers your coffee in just four to six minutes. That is impressive for a drip coffee maker of this size!

[Looking for Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 deals on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0bpjqs63w/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Let’s be honest, the dealbreaker for any coffee maker is the coffee. This machine nails it. The pump-free design ensures water reaches the perfect extraction temperature (about 196°F to 205°F, if you’re a nerd like me). The result? Consistently rich, flavorful coffee every single time. My mom even commented on how much more flavorful my coffee was during her last visit, and trust me, she doesn’t hand out compliments easily. It’s also impressively quiet during operation, which I appreciate since I’m not a fan of noisy kitchen gadgets, especially in the morning.

**Upsides**  
There are quite a few features that made this coffee maker a pleasure to use:  
- Simple brewing process with one-touch operation.  
- Brew-volume selector for half or full carafes.  
- Glass carafe and independent hotplate to maintain coffee temperature.  
- Pump-free design ensures optimal water temperature during brewing.  

**Areas of Concern**  
As much as I loved the experience overall, there were a few sticking points that jumped out.  
- The price point can feel steep compared to other similar drip coffee makers.  
- Lacks some advanced features like programmable settings or smartphone integration, which some may expect at this price.  
- Requires paper filters, which can be a hassle if you run out.  

**Competing Brands**  
In my extensive testing, I compared the Technivorm Moccamaster to competitors like the Breville Precision Brewer and the Bonavita Connoisseur. Where this coffee maker shines is its balanced simplicity—a straightforward brew process without a dozen settings to navigate. Breville’s offering is packed with customizable options, but that also makes it a bit intimidating. Meanwhile, Bonavita’s model achieves great coffee at a slightly lower cost, but its build quality doesn’t feel as premium as what the Technivorm offers. If you value design and simplicity, it edges ahead; if you’re looking for tech-heavy bells and whistles, it might lose out to fancier contenders.

**Value Assessment**  
The biggest question for anyone eyeing this coffee maker is whether it’s worth the cost. I think it largely depends on your priorities. For a casual coffee drinker, the price might be hard to justify. But if you’re someone who appreciates consistently excellent coffee and values a machine that keeps things beautifully simple, it’s a worthy investment. Plus, with its solid build, it’s likely to last years, and that 5-year warranty adds peace of mind. Still, I’m of the mindset that the premium you’re paying is for the overall experience—both the coffee and the convenience.

1lvkxmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1lvkxmp/gear_report_isle_royale_national_park_couples_trip/,Gear Report - Isle Royale National Park Couples Trip,"**WARNING:  Long post**

I just got back from an 8-night trip to Isle Royale National Park with my wife.  This was a couple's trip specifically designed so that she'd enjoy it.  (Mileages were short, and vertical elevation changes were limited.  We hiked a total of 70.5 miles in 8 days.)

Daytime highs were in the 60s and 70s with the highest temp being 81.  Nighttime lows were generally in the 50s and 60s, with the lowest temp being 49.  There was a thunderstorm the morning of day 2, and an hour-long shower mid day on day 7, and some light rain/mist on day 8.  Otherwise, it was dry.  This trip did not allow for any resupply:  all food and fuel had to be carried from the start.

This post will review lessons learned on specific bits of gear.  This was the first multi-day trip for many of these items, some of which were MYOG.  While I carried some non-UL items on this trip (chair, larger tent, tent footprint), much of the gear is the same as I carry on UL trips.  I learned a few important lessons I will apply in the future.

To begin with, here is a link to the[ lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/0idpuj) for what I actually carried.  (I will not be reviewing my wife's packing list, because she's decidedly NOT UL, though she is starting to think about improvements following this trip.)  I have marked my lighterpack list with red stars for the items that did not get used at all during the trip, and yellow stars for things that got used, but I could have done without or used something else instead.  Except for first aid kit stuff, there aren't many items that didn't get used.

And[ here is a link ](https://imgur.com/a/oZYHx6u)to the ***huge*** picture deck for the trip ICYRC.  This Igmur post will continue to grow as I process my pictures, and will be published to r/isleroyale when done.

**Now then, here is the list of successes, failures, and lessons learned.**

**Success:**  the MYOG DCF rain kilt that I made prior to this trip was fantastic.  In addition to its obvious function, it also served as something to place on the ground to unpack my pack onto, and as something to sit on when stopping for breaks to keep my butt dry.  However, I will be modifying it to make it longer.  A few more grams of extra DCF to provide water proof protection of my shins when going through wet bushes and undergrowth will definitely be worth it.  Here's some [Igmur](https://imgur.com/a/rain-kilt-0-51-dcf-pXC26cc) pics of it.  (As you can see, I've already added to its length once.)

**Success**:  Fuel Management.  For this trip breakfasts and dinners were homemade dehydrated creations following recipes from [Fresh off the Grid.](https://www.freshoffthegrid.com/)  These recipes require simmering to reconstitute them, not just boiling water.  Given the number of days/meals, fuel consumption/ fuel management was a concern to avoid needing to bring extra fuel canisters.  We brought a single 220 gram canister, and though we had to make some tweaks late in the trip, we ended using the very last bit of fuel for coffee the last morning at Rock Harbor campground (where we could have bought more if we needed it.)  In order to stretch a single canister of fuel this far I did the following:  1) I used a Jetboil Stash pot sans handle and lid.  (Note that this was a case where the extra weight of a heat exchanger pot reduced overall weight.)  2) I cut back the number of cups of coffee starting on day 5 when it became clear we were running low of fuel. 3) I started cold soaking the meals ahead of time such that the boil/simmer times could be cut dramatically.  This started on day 5 and resulted in some remarkable results.  *This was a huge lesson learned that will be repeated on future trips: rather than a 10-minute simmer, I will start soaking dinner as soon as camp is reached, then simply heat to boiling.   A*fter a couple hour soak, the meals were just fine with heating/minimal simmer.  I have no idea how much fuel this would have saved/how much longer I could have gone on the same canister, or even if I could have gotten away with a 110 gram canister rather than a 220 gram.  I'll be doing more experimenting on this in the future.

**Success**:  this squeegee[/scraper](https://www.rei.com/product/750412/gsi-outdoors-compact-scraper) is a luxury item, but given how useful it was throughout this trip, it deserves mention.  Simmering often burnt some food on the bottom of the pot, regardless of constant stirring during heating.  This item's ability to scrape/squeegee out both the cooking pot and bowls after each meal was made so *much easier with this item.*  It's 17.5 grams.  Luxury item to be sure, but wow.  That's 17.5 grams I'll happily bring.

**Failure**:  I've used the Platypus Quickdraw for a couple years and love it.  But I had a physical failure of the dirty water bag on day 6.  I had filled the bottles following dinner for the next morning's meal and placed a full dirty water bag for filtering the next morning on a shelf, roughly 36"" above floor level in a wooden-floor shelter.  It fell off of that shelf and split the seam upon impact, rending the bag useless.  By coincidence, my wife had stuffed an empty 20 ounce plastic soda bottle in the mesh pocket of my pack while we were on the boat ride to the island, which I had forgotten/neglected to dispose of before we started our trip.  So all week I was carrying around this bit of trash without a place to dispose of it.  After the dirty water bag broke I was glad I had it.  The Platypus Quickdraw has internal threads on the input side that fit standard soda/water bottles.  After the experience I am contemplating if I'll replace the dirty water bag or not.  The bottle solution weighs less, and doubles as a good dedicated bidet bottle.

**Failure:**  Toilet Paper Management.    We did not manage consumption of toilet paper well on the trip.  (Why did we even bring TP you ask?  Why did we not just use a bidet?  Remember, this was a couple's trip.  My wife wasn't too keen on the idea of a bidet.)  We brought a whole roll, but by day 5 it became obvious we were running short.  We ran out on day 7.  Thankfully I had neglected to remove a 4.5 gram bidet from the poop kit prior to the trip.  That 20-ounce plastic soda bottle served dual purposes.  Yeah, my wife used the bidet because we had no choice, but she was not impressed.

**Failure**:  I intentionally brought long pants on this trip as part of my mosquito strategy.  Because of that I did not bring gaiters as I thought they would be unnecessary.  I should have brought them.  I got debris in my shoes multiple times per day - evergreen needles, little rocks, sticks, you name it.  Perhaps in a different environment they would not have been needed, but here they would have been valuable.

**Success:**  speaking of bugs, the MVP award for this trip goes to my headnet.  I lived in this thing.  u/gosox2525 put me onto [this bugnet](https://www.simblissity.net/ultralight-mosquito-headnet.htm) from Simblissity.  *It really does weigh just 11.5 grams*.  The material is softer and more comfortable than other headnets I've tried.  Highly recommended.

**Success:**  MYOG UL bags.  I made my ditty bag, pillow bag, and cook kit bag out of 0.56 OSY 7d ripstop nylon, and a replacement tent bag out of 0.77 OSY Mountain silnylon, both materials from Ripstop by the Roll.  All worked great, and solved/customized solutions for less weight than alternatives (including ziploc bags!)  I agree that fewer/no bags would be the purist way to go, but if you have to have bags, MYOG is the bomb.

**Failure:**  Adotec bear bag.  IRNP started requiring bear-resistant containers this year, not because of bears, but because of foxes and wolves.  I bought the largest size (20 liter) of Adotec bear bag for this trip, but it was not large enough to fit all the food for 2 people for 8 days.  My 20 Liter Ursack was.  This is entirely because the Ursack is a more compliant material.  The Adotec's stiffness ends up wasting space as it won't easily conform to what you put in it.  So I ended up taking the heavier Ursack.  Perhaps if I beat the crap out of the Adotec in a dryer with a shoe (like is commonly done with Tyvek to soften it up) this will be a viable replacement.  Until then, it's not.

**Success:**  Tenacious Tape.  My wife's S2S Ether Light sleeping pad developed a leak on day 3.  The bubble test was able to locate it, and a 2""x2"" patch of Tenacious tape that had long occupied my repair kit finally got used.  Success!  Had no issues the rest of the trip.

**Failure:**  MYOG UL 2-person synthetic quilt.  I made [this quilt ](https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/comments/1kc8czn/finished_it/)about 2 months ago specifically for this trip.   It is made out of Argon 49 and 3.6 OSY Apex Climashield.  It's actual weight is 691 grams.  That's pretty light for a 2 person quilt, but I made a big mistake:  I followed someone else's pattern rather than measuring my wife and I and making it to fit us.  Bottom line:  It needs to be both longer and wider for us to be comfortable.  It would work great if we were smaller people, a little shorter, or if we don't like to toss and turn during the night.  I will be selling it for the price of the materials I have in it (a bargain) and making another one.  If you're interested, DM me.

**Success:**  Durston Iceline Poles.  These were Xmas presents from my wife to me.  I've taken them on a few day/training hikes, but this was the first multi day trip.  I like them - a lot.  Highly recommended.

**Failure:**  Mountain Hardware Trail Sender pants, size L.  I bought these after reading an article by u/deputysean.  I have two problems with them. The first is that they're too short.  I wear a 34X34.  They aren't offered by sizes that way - just simple sizes like small, medium, large, and extra large.  I got a size large.  I disliked the elastic cuff bottoms, so I took those out and re-hemmed them. That gained me about 1.5"" of length, but they're still too short.  I've got an exposed bit of skin between the top of my ankle length socks and the bottom of the pants.  This allowed Minnesota's state bird (i.e. mosquitos) to feast on me.  And those buggers are tenacious.  (This is another reason why I wish I brought gaiters - they would have covered the gap.)  Picaridin wasn't always an effective deterrent.

My second concern is that after 10 total days of use, the stitching appears to be fraying.  [See Igmur pics here](https://imgur.com/a/eKJIQa8).  We'll see how long they last.

**Success:**  I have found an awesome UL combination for camp/sleep clothes.  I wore a [Finetrack Elemental](https://www.finetrackglobal.com/en_US/shop_by_activity/hiking-trekking/hiking-trekking-summer/hiking-trekking-summer-tops/hiking-trekking-summer-tops-t-l1/) T-shirt and a pair of[ Dutchwear Gear Laundry shorts](https://dutchwaregear.com/product/dutch-shorts/).  Total weight for these two items combined:  96 grams!

**Success:**  I've already mentioned it, but it was such a success I'll mention it again.  My 9""x13"" MYOG bag out of 7d 0.56 OSY Ripstop that I stuffed clothes into to make a pillow, weighing just 5 grams, worked fantastically!  The best thing I found to stuff it with was my puffy jacket.  Super comfortable.  A critical review of my lighterpack list might tag my puffy as an unnecessary item and ripe for omission.  In retrospect I would agree that I should not have brought it.  (I did end up wearing it twice.)   But it makes an uber comfortable pillow!

**Success**:  I have long been an Uberlite user.  However, both of my Uberlite pads currently have leaks and I hadn't gotten around to finding/fixing them in the weeks preceding the trip, so I bought a Thermarest Xlite (the yellow one.)  I bought the smallest/ lightest version of that pad available, but it was still >100 grams heavier than my regular Uberlite.  Well, after a week on it, I can say that I really like it.  I'll bring my Uberlite (once repaired), but I can see why so many people like this.

**Failure, kind of**:  I have long brought just a pair of 5-gram Litesmith [scissors](https://www.litesmith.com/micro-scissors-with-cover/?searchid=128126&search_query=scissors) for opening food bags rather than the  22-gram Swiss Army Classic knife.  On this trip I really wished I had the knife as it has functions I wished I had - specifically to clean under my fingernails.  I accomplished this with the edge of my wife's spoon, but I would have preferred the right tool for the job.

**Failure:**  MYOG Durston 2P footprint.  Footprints are not UL, but are creature comfort items I sometimes bring.  I like them because they allow me to roll up my tent on a clean surface rather than in the dirt/mud, and for the Xmid in particular, I've designed them to provide a floor to the vestibule section so my stuff is not sitting in the dirt.  I MYOG'd a foot print for my OG Xmid 2P for this trip.  My mistake is that I based the measurements on the diagram on [Durston's website](https://durstongear.com/cdn/shop/files/X-Mid-2-Floorplan-1.jpg?v=1741282336&width=1200), not my actual tent.  Durston has evolved the gear over successive iterations/generations.  My mistake is that I forgot he made the overall size smaller by reducing the gap between the inner and the outer a couple years ago such that the currently published measurements are smaller than they originally were back when the tents were distributed through Drop.  So my footprint is smaller than intended.  I will be making another footprint to correct this.  All this to say, if you are interested in a footprint for a current generation 2P that follows the design guidelines I [published here](https://genxbackpacker.com/xmid-footprint-quest/), DM me.

**Future MYOG stuff:**  Prior to the trip I MYOG'd myself a prototype water bottle holder for a Durston Kakwa pack out of monolite.  Total weight for the mod:  6 grams!  After a week using it, I want to remake it with a couple lessons learned.  I'll be posting the revised pattern on r/myog once I finish this.  I've also come up with a couple tweaks on existing bits of gear that I'll knock out sometime soon:  extension collars on Zpacks Vertice rain gloves to cover the forearm up to the elbow (useful when using an umbrella but no rain jacket), and an improvement to my umbrella mounting system for my Kakwa-55

**Not quite right yet:**  I brought along prototypes of a pair of products I am collaborating with MoosetrackPacks to develop.  These will require revision and more testing, but they're close.  I'm excited about them as once they are debugged I expect them to be popular within the backpacking community, though not specifically the UL community.  (Please spare me from your wrath DeputySean!)

**Undetermined:**  XUL MYOG DCF Rainjacket.  I MYOG'd this in the weeks before the trip, as [seen here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/comments/1lacy0i/xul_rain_jacket_out_of_051_dcf/)  It never rained hard enough or in such a way that I wanted the rain jacket over the kilt/umbrella combination, so I don't yet have any actual experience with it.  However, it was still a weight reduction over the previous silpoly rain jacket.",14,1752073072.0,Ultralight,5,1.0,False
1lvkwbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1lvkwbq/im_a_current_summer_associate_who_slept_with_an/,I’m a current summer associate who slept with an attorney. Need advice/help.,"Hey all, I've gotten myself into a tough situation and I'm really hoping for some advice.

I’ve never thought of myself as an attractive woman, but I've noticed that people have started to look at me differently since I entered law school. It might just be a confidence thing, but I feel like I'm finally starting to feel wanted. I don’t have any real relationship experience, so this has been a nice new feeling.

I'm now in a weird work situation and I don’t know how I could move forward from this. I’m starting to think I may have ruined my life.

For context, I’m a summer associate at a pretty reputable east coast big law firm. My class is pretty small (fewer than 10), and I’m only one of a few girls. HR made it clear at the beginning of the summer that we shouldn't be in relationships with summers or attorneys, but it seemed like the kind of thing they all laughed off. It didn't seem like a serious rule if that makes sense.

Anyway, one of the attorneys in the practice group I want to work in started taking a particular interest in me. We would go out for coffees, lunches, and I would spend a lot of time shadowing in his office. Long story short, we ended up sleeping with each other.

I realize that this was a bad move. I can especially tell now as I’m pretty sure he told one of the older partners, who seems it like he has kind of a boys club buddy relationship with. I can’t tell if I’m starting to get weird looks from the partner or if I’m just being paranoid, but I’m really starting to freak out.

I’ve thought about coming clean to the other summers to clear the air, but I’m worried it will affect my return offer. I go to a T-6 and have pretty substantial debt, so I really need this big law job. The worst part is that I’ve developed a crush on one of the other summer associates and I think that he might feel the same about me. I really don’t want this to jeopardize our potential relationship.

I feel like I’m entering a dark tunnel with no end in sight. I fear it may be over for me.",0,1752072982.0,LawSchool,22,0.38,False

And that won’t change, don’t message me thinking you can “fix” me. If you want a more physically intimate relationship, I’m not the right person for you, and that’s alright \^-\^  I’m also strictly monogamous!

**Keywords:** atheist, leftie/liberal, childfree, chubby, tattooed, age range 25-30

**Who I’m looking for:** A long term romantic partner, located somewhere in Europe (because time zones and easier travel). Northern Europe would be superb but not expected. I’d prefer someone who’s around my age, so please be around 25-30. Since I’m ace, I do hope you have a low drive/needs or perhaps you’re on the ace spectrum as well. My goal is to eventually settle down, but I don’t want kids. When it comes to traits, kindness, emotional intelligence, stability and honesty are desired.

**Dealbreakers**/ **Big** **NOs for me:** Right-wing views, racism, homophobia/transphobia, drugs, smoking, drinking a lot (I don’t drink at all)

**Who I am:** I’m 27 years old and live in Finland. I have a culture and arts degree and work in PR/communications/marketing, so I’d say I’m a pretty creative person. I’m a city girl and love cultural experiences, be it sightseeing, occasional shopping sprees, museum visits or coffee dates. On the other hand, I’m also an introverted homebody who loves staying home with my favourite TV show. I’m into fashion, photography and writing, and I love traveling whenever I get the chance. Sports and games are two things I have never been into lol.

I’m a bit slow to warm up so I might come off as a bit shy in the beginning, but I promise it gets better once I’m fully comfortable! After that I’m generally an annoying, sarcastic little demon lol. I’m an atheist, and politically a leftie/liberal (I’m not very politically active, though). Looks wise I’d say I’m about average. 160cm, chubby, tattooed. Pale skin and short dark brown hair.

I’ve contacted some auction places but they aren’t interested in high volume collections, and prefer to sell small items of high value, of course. 

I thought about selling them myself, in lots online. This also sounds like a huge pain but considering it. But before doing that I want to make sure I’m not selling any big ticket gems worth a ton of money individually  in the lot- I’d prefer to sell those like the auctioneers do, one at a time. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to deal with this situation? My time is valuable, so I’m thinking about hiring a specialist who could thumb through the collections and earmark the very valuable items before the lots go out.

While the specific prompts may vary each year, LBS typically asks about your career goals, leadership experiences, and personal qualities. Here are some general tips to keep in mind:

* **Be Specific:** Use concrete examples to illustrate your points and make your essays more engaging.
* **Highlight Your Unique Value Proposition:** Explain how your experiences and skills make you a valuable addition to the LBS community.
* **Show, Don’t Tell:** Use vivid anecdotes and stories to demonstrate your qualities rather than simply stating them.
* **Align with LBS’s Values:** Connect your experiences and goals to LBS’s mission and values.

  
**Sample for ESSAY**

**What are your post-MBA goals, and how will your prior experience and the London Business School programme contribute towards these?**

Being instinctive and conscientiously diligent, throughout my life I have been entrusted with leadership roles, from holding the position of head boy of a school of 2,000+ pupils to leading the football team in college. After college, I was selected from 500+ candidates who appeared for the selection process of the X Army, for which a total of \~400K candidates appear each year. Post a gruelling yearlong training at the ABC Academy, Z, following in the footsteps of my father, I joined the ABC, which provides ICT solutions to the X Army.  
  
On October 20XX, I was deployed in the conflict-ridden KL. I led specialist teams of 25+ personnel, maintaining communication links in extremely hostile conditions, and established two communication towers at 12,500+ ft leading two diverse teams of 15-20 people each, which provided communication to 1,500+ military personnel at each site. After four years on October 20XX, I was sent to an elite strike formation of the X Army, where I managed the administrative and disciplinary aspects of 1,100+ personnel. During planned operational deployments, I managed the Network Operations Centre, ensuring information security of communication links. With a profile aligned with strike formations, I was then sent as a communication specialist to the first Mountain ABC of the X Army, where I have been serving from January 20XX to date. My core competency in the field of telecommunication and information/ cyber security has made me appreciate the disruptive capabilities of the combination of these technologies.  
  
At this juncture, after 10 years of military service, I seek to leap into the business world, plug my skill gaps, and develop my business acumen to augment the transferable military skills I have gained along the way. I am positive that London Business School is an ideal avenue for me to achieve my future career goals.  
  
Post MBA, I want to transition into the information/ cyber security vertical of a leading consulting firm like XYZ & Co. The line dividing the real and virtual world will soon disappear with the advent of AI and niche tech like Brain–brain-computer interface. Information security, thus, takes precedence as the corruption of data could turn a cyborg into a bionic zombie. My long-term goal is to leverage the business skills accrued at London Business School and start an information security firm in X, providing solutions to enterprises and agencies to better protect their critical infrastructure and provide digital education and training to the masses. The program will further provide me with an avenue to interact with a diverse international cohort, which will help me gain valuable cultural insights, broaden my horizons, and build a global network.  
  
At London Business School, I am excited to learn the business management fundamentals through classes in Data Analytics, Accounting, and Operations. With my 10-year work experience in the ICT domain, I am looking forward to contributing to the Tech & Media Club. Lastly, as a veteran, I wish to significantly contribute to the Military in Business Club.

1lvks1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1lvks1s/after_3_years_of_home_assistant_i_finally_cracked/,"After 3 years of Home Assistant, I finally cracked the code to WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor) - and it only took breaking everything twice","You know that moment when your spouse gives you *the look* after the lights randomly turn on at 3 AM? Yeah, that was me last month. Again.

I've been deep in the Home Assistant rabbit hole since 2022. Started with a single smart bulb, now running 147 devices across Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi, and even some ESP32s I flashed myself. But here's the thing - my family was ready to go back to regular switches after my ""clever"" automations kept failing at the worst times.

The breaking point came when my presence detection failed during a dinner party. Picture this: 12 guests, fancy dinner, and suddenly the house thinks everyone left. Lights off. Music stops. Thermostat drops to away mode. My mother-in-law literally asked if we forgot to pay the electric bill.

So I spent the next two weeks rebuilding EVERYTHING with one goal: make it invisible. No more ""hey Google,"" no more explaining why the bathroom fan runs for exactly 7 minutes, no more debugging in front of guests.

Here's what actually worked:

* Ditched WiFi presence detection for these $12 Aqara FP2 sensors (seriously, mmWave is magic)
* Created ""manual override"" switches that disable automations for 2 hours when toggled
* Built a hidden dashboard showing what automation is controlling each room
* Added a ""guest mode"" that simplifies everything to basic on/off
* Most importantly: every automation now has a 10-second delay before triggering, giving people time to manually override

The result? My wife now ASKS me to automate things. Last week she said ""can you make the coffee machine turn on when I enter the kitchen in the morning?"" I nearly cried.

The real secret wasn't better code or fancier sensors. It was accepting that the best automation is the one nobody notices. Your family doesn't care about your perfectly crafted Node-RED flows - they just want the lights to work.

Anyone else struggle with the WAF challenge? What's your biggest automation fail that taught you something valuable?",140,1752072699.0,homeassistant,61,0.89,False

1lvkpcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lvkpcq/the_addiction/,The addiction,"I loved you on a Tuesday morning,
light carving itself into the mirror,
you saying I was “perfect,” your voice warm
as coffee steam while your eyes were miles away,
already wandering down a browser you promised to close,
a screen you promised wasn’t more alive
than the way I curled beside you in your narrow bed.

You called me “great” two weeks before you closed the door,
before the Disney Cruise set sail,
Mickey waving on the dock while you were planning
how to let me go while seasick,
while the fireworks burst above fake castles,
while you let your love slip away like sweat
on the railing, slipping, slipping
into salt and foam, into the hollow
you left in my hand.

We walked past the buffet and families wearing ears,
past screaming children with sticky hands,
and I kept waiting for you to say “I love you,”
you said “You’re perfect,”
and in that moment I wanted to believe
you meant forever,
not “perfect enough to let go,
perfect enough to hurt.”

In the cabin you pulled away when I reached,
the ocean rocking us to sleep, but your eyes
glowed blue in the dark from the phone,
scrolling, scrolling, scrolling,
while I tried to keep my voice soft,
tried to be the one you would stay for,
the one you would choose over
pixels and bodies that could never hold you
the way I did.

You said, “It’s not you, it’s me,”
a cliché I tasted like acid,
like the orange juice from breakfast on the deck,
my tears dropping into the ocean we were floating on,
waves crashing like the hope I had
you would choose me, not the glow,
not the endless scroll, not the promise
of faceless bodies behind dorm doors
in a college you were already planning to search.

You broke up with me over the phone in the morning,
like pulling off a Band-Aid you had already peeled
halfway while I slept,
calling me “perfect” while you packed up your love
in a suitcase with your college hoodies,
your new dreams, your unlocked phone.

And I wondered what part of me was not enough—
if the way I held you after nightmares,
or the way I laughed too loud,
or the way I tried to understand your addiction,
or the way I asked if I was still beautiful
when you turned away after closing your laptop
in the middle of the night,
was the part that made you decide you needed
to see what else was out there.

I watched the cartoon princesses dance on the deck
while my heart sank below the waves,
the Disney music too bright for the ache in my chest,
and you stood beside me,
saying I was “perfect,” saying “great,”
as if those words could hold me together
while you were already letting go.

I loved you while you left,
loved you while you chose a screen,
loved you while you shut the door,
loved you while you let the ship sail away
from what we were, what I tried to be for you—
everything, enough,
more than the glow,
more than the bodies you could scroll through,
more than the loneliness you filled
with strangers who would never know you
like I did.

And now the fireworks go off over the black water,
and I stand alone on the deck,
holding the ghost of your hand,
thinking of the words you said
while you were already leaving,
calling me “perfect,”
calling me “great,”
calling me everything except
what you really meant was:
“goodbye.”

My long background info to the question follows afterwards.

\-Would the US Model that basically runs on 120V under-perform when used in 100V environment?

\-Same thing for coffee grinders. If it is designed to run on 120V, would it under-perform when used in 100V environment?

  
So, after doing some research here and there for the past half year or so, I finally bought the Moccamaster KBGV on Amazon during the current Prime sale. And I'm now also trying to get the Fellow Gen 2 Ode coffee bean grinder.

I have been feeling so excited for this brand new coffee experience to come, but then realized that I didn't look/consider too closely about the voltage it runs on.

I currently live in US so that is not a problem to run both the coffee machine and grinder under its 120V structure, but I will be going back to Japan in 1-2 years most likely where the outlet is 100V.

I believe I can still ""run"" both device under 100V, but will it affect them to under-perform due to that lack of 20V difference?

I've sent the question over to Moccamaster (or Technivorm?) via their online form just now, but thought I'd try to hear what the actual users had to say here.

I don't think many others are in same situations, but would love to hear any opinions from experience or just by common knowledge.

Looking at getting a machine for home use. Have had some experince with coffee machines through a cafe at work but nothing serious.

Ive stumbled upon a Breville barista max second hand for £130  (I have seen the distinction between breville and sunbeam in the UK dw) but it has a tempertature issue.Seller says its about 10C colder. This comes with a inbuilt grinder and would just wait for a bit down the line before getting a stand alone one.

The alternative is Breville barista mini and getting a stand alone grinder now. Barista mini is on offer at £135 off of amazon and am unsure on what grinder i would get to go with it.

Are there any machines that are clearly more worthwhile getting that im being blind to or is the second hand machine worthwhile as an entry into home espresso?

I was scrolling through the Kerala relationship subreddit and noticed that both men and women seem to be struggling,  whether it’s with relationships, dating apps, or just finding genuine connections. I just wanted to share a few thoughts. So getting straight to the point.

I was that guy, stuck in my own head, for a while, I even tried playing the 'f-boy' role, which worked out in my favour but unironically just turned out to be sad and draining. But here’s the thing, i've had my fair share of success with women, and now I’m in a genuinely loving relationship. And what's the secret ? It was laughably simple, I'd just talk to people, like, everyone, wherever I went. That’s it. That’s the real key boys.

Seriously, that's the whole damn thing. You wanna meet someone? Find a relationship? Or just build a better life? You have to actually be in the world.

1) Just open your mouth :
I swear, this is it, that person waiting for their coffee? The guy standing next to you in the queue? The lady who bills your items? Just say something, anything ""Rainy day, huh?"" or ask a question about whatever's around you. You don't have to get a number every time, obviously. Just practice being a human, more you do it, the easier it gets. Events, shows, libraries, grocery stores, you name it, whenever there are people present.

For example, i'd this cute cute pharmacist, for weeks, I'd just make little bits of small talk when I picked up my stuff. ""Busy day today?"" or ""That new anti-inflammatory, is it any good?"" Just normal stuff. Nothing flirty, just genuine.
After weeks of these quick, casual chats, I’d started building a connection, and it felt mutual. So I went for it, i  asked her where she lived and if she’d like to meet for coffee sometime. Got her number, and we actually went out a few times. All because I just... talked

2) Be a genuinely good dude :
Smile, say please and thank you, hold a door. Just be a decent human to everyone, not just people you're trying to impress, not just attractive women, everyone. Pick up on that energy. Again, the more you practice, the better you get.

3) Keep it light :
When you're chatting, let the conversation breathe, don’t grill people, don’t try to act like an ultra confident f-boy or Mr Charming. Just talk , if it clicks, awesome, if not, nothing's lost, being chill about it is unironically attractive. Be authentic, be yourself.

4) It's a numbers game, seriously, it is :
The more you're out in the world, actually talking to people, the more chances you get. You’re not gonna meet anyone sitting at home, texting the same circle every week, hoping the universe drops someone in your lap.

The more people you meet, the more likely you are to find a girl who genuinely fits what you're looking for. Your person’s out there, living their own life just like you, but if you're invisible, how are you ever gonna cross paths?

Reality check: staying in your comfort zone, doing the same sh*t every day, gives you close to zero shot at anything new. Unless you get insanely lucky (which, let’s be honest, most don’t), you’ll keep getting what you’ve always got. Get out there, talk, let things happen.


5) No desperation, ever :
This one's huge, don't double text, don't blow up their phone, have your own life, be busy. If someone’s into you, they’ll show it. If they’re not, move on, your worth isn’t tied to one person’s interest, respect yourself, move on, 4  billion women, adutha parivadikal nokuka.

6) If it feels right, ask them out : Don’t overthink it. If you’re genuinely vibing, just say “Hey, I’ve really enjoyed talking to you. I’d love to grab a drink sometime.” Simple, clear.

7) Rejection? It’s just a no :
Happens to everyone. It just means she’s not your person. Brush it off, learn what you can, and move on. There are too many cool people in the world to get hung up on one no. Develop the mindset of not internalising rejection, just take it as that specific person not being interested in what you have to offer, take it as an opportunity for practice and learning, and move on to the next person, rinse, repeat.

Honestly  it's not some secret strategy. It’s just about being present, being real, and being willing to connect. Stop thinking so much, put on a genuine smile, and just talk to someone. It worked for me. It'll work for you too, only if you are brave enough to take that first step; Remember yesterday was the best day to start of course but today is the next best.

Good luck.

1lvkn1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1lvkn1o/actually_writing_down_a_list_of_foods_my_kids/,Actually *writing down* a list of foods my kids don’t like has been so helpful.,"So I’ll admit I’m a dad (46M) who doesn’t always have the greatest memory with certain stuff in my kids’ lives.  13F, 16M, 19F.

I always listen and chat with them, but certain specific stuff they tell me, I think “OK ya, I’ll remember XYZ…” And I hate to admit it, but often that info slips from my mind embarrassingly quick…

My wife (45F) has always had an uncanny and remarkable memory (people comment on it all the time), so I admit that I’ve used that as a crutch for certain stuff with our kids.

One of the things that I often struggle to remember is what foods they don’t like. I know that probably sounds “absent father” terrible, but it’s the truth for me.

So approx 1 year ago after one of my kids didn’t eat a side dish I made for dinner, I said to myself “Ok so you think you’re gonna remember that… but come on… you know you… and you know you’re not… And you need to know this stuff… So why don’t you just write it down?!” So… I did.  And yes, I know they’re older so I probably should’ve taken action on this years ago but… hopefully better late than never.

I started a list on my phone, for each kid, that every time they didn’t like something, I’d add it to their list.  And over time I saw the patterns & nuances. And something about me writing it down helped me lock it in my mind much better.

I know this is all probably me “stating the obvious” but I just wanted to share this little improvement that I made later in my kids’ lives, that’s made me feel good and also that they have noticed and appreciated that I “know them” just a little better :)

And for a little comic relief, I thought I’d share the list for our two youngest kids.  Thanks to anyone who read this far!

1lvkma1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GastricBypass/comments/1lvkma1/14_years_postop_menopause_and_food_sensitivities/,"14 years post-op, menopause, and food sensitivities","I had my surgery days before I turned 29 by a USA military Dr. My ex was enlisted. So not the best surgeon. 

By the time I was 30, I was a size 00 (5'6 highest over 300, lowest was 115). I just turned 43 in June. 

I had complications. I couldn't tolerate many foods at all. I basically starved the weight off. My stomach is too small now. I've also had to have surgery because my disconnected intestines wrapped around my good intestines, and I was trying to vomit my intestines. 

I've had 3 gastric bleeds, and since the jump I've never been able to tolerate sugars, beef, carbonation, the normal things we are supposed to avoid. 

Cool cool. It makes it easier to not cheat. 

When I started going through menopause (surgically induced 9 years ago), I noticed I was gaining weight.

My biggest fear. 

My stomach has always been a problem and coffee started to give me diarrhea. Broccoli and cauliflower give me bad gas pains where I am on the floor crying in fetal position. 

Recently, I went to a new Dr and she checked my labs for my gut health. I react to wheat, eggs, yeast, milk, corn, and cocoa.

WTF.

So now I have to see a specialist. I already did the anticandida diet. 

My diet is already so limited. With the bleeds, pains, intolerance, I worry how I'll be able to eat anything without reacting. The cross contamination with all of those ingredients don't make things easier. 

I don't want anyone else to suffer like me, but I also feel alone. My husband is so amazing and has changed his diet with me (mostly). It never bothers me when people eat foods I can't eat. I live vicariously through them instead. It's different to be able to talk to someone who really understands the fears of having a good life, etc. 

Thanks to those who read this far. Anyone else having these issues years later? The studies aren't out there, and it doesn't look like the studies are going to boom anytime soon either. ",5,1752072310.0,GastricBypass,2,0.86,False

* UK households face growing mortgage burdens as interest rates remain high.

* Coffee and healthcare industries adapt to price volatility and regulatory scrutiny.

As the[ Bank](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/inside-brazils-148m-banking-breach-crypto-laundering-and-insider-betrayal/) of England warns of increasing mortgage costs, millions of UK homeowners may face financial strain, particularly those transitioning from fixed-rate deals.

Across the Atlantic, US financial markets showed unexpected calm in the face of tariff threats by [President Trump](https://worldmagzine.com/politics/former-president-trump-should-appear-in-the-court-next-week/). Major indices posted modest gains, with the tech-driven Nasdaq leading the way.

# Markets Stay Resilient as Households Brace for Financial Headwinds

[Coffee prices](https://worldmagzine.com/politics/former-pennsylvania-congressman-bud-shuster-was-dead-now/), which soared in 2024 due to droughts in Brazil and Vietnam, are beginning to stabilize according to Lavazza’s chairman. The spike in Arabica prices, which peaked at $4.20/lb, was driven by production shortfalls and logistic disruptions. Now, retailers hope consumers may have already seen the worst of the price hikes.

The UK’s FTSE 100 edged closer to record highs, buoyed by gains in oil and tobacco stocks. British American Tobacco climbed following a bullish outlook from analysts, while Shell benefited from a rise in crude oil prices. Despite this, marketing firm WPP and copper traders dragged the index down due to tariff-related concerns.

The currency markets saw the British pound dip below $1.36, largely due to a strengthening[ US dollar](https://worldmagzine.com/stock-market/euro-emerges-as-a-new-safe-haven-as-traders-retreat-from-a-tumbling-us-dollar/). Simultaneously, gold prices declined to $3,291.46 per ounce, reflecting a broader shift in investor appetite as they recalibrate portfolios in response to interest rate moves and macroeconomic signals.

Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group finds itself under scrutiny from US federal prosecutors. Allegations involve the company possibly encouraging inflated Medicare diagnoses to secure higher payments. The FBI and health department agents have conducted interviews, although the company maintains its openness to regulatory oversight.

From housing [finance](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/pakistan-launches-crypto-council-to-regulate-digital-finance/) in the UK to healthcare compliance in the US, global markets remain alert yet steady, navigating through a web of economic pressures and policy changes.

1lvkh8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lvkh8e/abuse_eater/,—Abuse Eater—,"Day 1: This is my therapy journal issued to me by my ASA group. I will try to write in it every day as advised by my group therapist. My name is Orson, Orson Grim. Son of Judy and Donthan Grim. Father of Oliver Grim. I am important.                                   
                                     
Day 2: Woke up fine. At work, my boss Alicson gave me extra paperwork. There was no traffic on the way to my meeting. During the meeting; Ms. Carter talked about her mother, Linus talked about his teacher, and for Abby her husband. It kinda pisses me me off. I'll try not to think about it.                                      
                                  
Day3: I can't believe this! Oli got in trouble. The principal said that Oliver had pushed a girl off the playset for stealing his baseball. I tried scolding him on the drive back to his grandparents' but with the shake in his tiny little voice as he said ""She pulled on my clothes, papa! She pulled on my clothes! You said no one is allowed to pull on my clothes!"" Kept me from punishing him in any way. It broke my heart. I know I have to get myself together, but these damn meetings just end up tiring me out.                                               
                                      
Day4: Dr. Wong caught me putting Jack in my coffee(technically all she saw was my flask, but she could definitely smell it on me), She said that I have to get better for my son. Not that I don't know that already(She didn't have to get so close to say that though).                    
                                    
Day5: The boss keeps giving me extra work, and Brandon joked about her trying to hook up with me. God, I hope not. The last thing I need is someone trying to steal my time when I should be getting better.                           
                                
Day6: Alicson, that bitch! That BITCH Alicson! FUCKING UGLY, DISGUSTING, FILTHY WHORE! HOW DARE SHE?! SHE HAS NO RIGHT TO TOUCH ME LIKE THAT! THAT BITCH ALICSON! FUCKING PERVERT!!! I WANT TO QUIT!                                   
                                                      
Day7: Oli is staying at his grandparents' house. My head is killing me. Dr. Wong keeps looking at me. That bitch probably read my journal without permission.                                 
                                              
Day8: Being here pisses me off! So many of these people could have left or at least said something. Not like me! I wasn't scared! I had a son(have a son), I couldn't just leave! Lest that senseless dog turn her temper on Oliver! But that new boy, Donovan? Now, Donovan, he's truly pathetic and I mean that not in an insulting manner. I feel like he understands me. Like he understands us. Someone we can all truly pity.
                                            
Day9: This morning was great! I could feel it, something wonderful was going to happen. Alicson did her usual banter and touching but I was not about to let her make me late for my meeting again. I was out of there before she even had a chance to make me stay. I had to see that boy again, I had to talk to Donovan. After the meeting, Donovan wanted to meet me out behind the community center.          
It was nice talking to him, telling him about Oliver, my parents, my ex-wife, and Alicson. I couldn't stop myself from talking. I found myself telling him things about my trauma that I hadn't told my own parents. I admit that I did tell him some things that a 26-year-old man had absolutely no right telling someone his age but he didn't complain. He scowled at the points of my story that deserved anger and smiled for those that deserved joy. The best part is that he never once looked at me with pity, only understanding.                                
                                          
Day10: I didn't have to go to sleep the other night, but that's ok. I was doing something better. I saw Alicson. She didn't dare try to touch me now that I'm bigger than her. Finally, I got to see the look of fear in her eyes as she ran from us. But we scooped her up and broke her into pieces. Don didn't eat all of her, it would have upset his stomach.                    
Anyway, if you connected with my experience you should talk to Donovan. His last name changes a lot but his first name is always Donovan, he has fluffy mid-length brown hair with messy bangs that barely pass his eyebrows, his shape or body looks like a teen boy around 15-17, and he has close to Amazonite colored eyes(not green or blue or turquoise). He loves wearing a sweater vest over some sort of button-up, and always wears circle glasses. Now, I will warn you that the face splitting and black fluid is a bit frightening and it might hurt around the 5th stage of the liquefaction but after that, nothing! You won't feel pain, will have lots of new friends, Donovan will take care of you, and keep you fed with the rest of us. Make sure you tell him about all your trauma and abusers, we prefer the taste of men. They more muscle mass.                                  
We can't wait to meet you ♡

The school is Chiang Kai Shek College, it's in Narra, Tondo, Manila (it has 2 campuses, one in P. Algue, the other in Narra Street). The school offers a BSA program AND a 1-year bridging program for BSAIS and BSMA grads. 

The modality is full face-to-face.   
  
PROS: 

1. Tuition is relatively cheap compared to other universities.  
2. Maximum load of 26-27 units for the 2 semesters you'll be enrolling in.   
3. The teachers teach well! (Yes, the teachers teach! :D)  
4. The facilities are nice. (Malamig ang aircon)  
5. The emphasis of topics is more on the board exam subjects.   
6. They beat the national average for CPALE. (A sign of an okay to good accounting school)  
7. Surprisingly very attractive to employers (Something about the work ethic of CKSC students + being able to speak a little Chinese)

CONS: 

1. It's a small school. The whole college campus is one building.   
2. You don't have many food options. (The cafeteria is small)  
3. There aren't a lot of coffee shops, study places to go to after school.   
4. There are Chinese classes. (classes are basic Chinese, and the two teachers teaching are quite nice and forgiving in grading)

He was quite direct about his feelings initially - the longer we dated the more we seemed to get along and like each other’s company. However ( otherwise I wouldn’t be here haha)  somewhere at the end of the 2 month mark into dating I felt he was - holding back maybe? Or not 100% transparent about his feelings? Couldn’t pin point what it was but I had a gut feeling. - anyway he’s sooo attentive when we date, really plans ahead for them makes time for me etc, but then over text he starts to feels like a different person. He’s still polite and answers promptly but never really keeps the conversation going - nor initiates it. 

Now, I’ve been single for a 2 years and feel like I am in quite a healthy mental headspace to start a relationship again- also just feel like I’ve had time to myself and am happy to look for something serious. I was quite clear about this from the get go.  

He starts to not text for days at a time - to the point it gets to 4/5 days he’s not texted ( and I’ve stopped making a conscious effort to start conversations cos it was always me) . So I send a message, and quite clearly say that I really like him and like spending time with him but that if this is the way he communicates , it’s just not good enough for me, no ill will - just doesn’t work for me. He says he’d thought about it and although he really liked me as a person ( he was really quite nice and showered me in compliments) he just didn’t have that relationship spark , and someday someone, not him, was going to make me very happy . He asks if we can stay friends , and I question whether he means that or is just saying it to say it . He says he means it , would very much like to stay friends - so I say : that could work but I can’t just switch off my feelings like that, I’ll need space and time - and he says: of course, I understand, take as much time as you need. 

Fast forwards a couple of weeks ( I’m taking space and time here) - he messages me and asks to go out for a coffee together .

Now, my first thought is - I thought you said I could take as much space and time as I needed, what’s changed now?  I don’t say this though ( although maybe I should have) and instead ask whether he still intends to remain friends and he says yes.

We go out for a morning coffee- he asks whether I’m free the rest of the day, I (cautiously) say yes and we spend half a day together browsing book shop and walking and chatting through gallery/ museum. He then asks whether I’m free the next day for a pub quiz. I have to decline as I have prior plans. 

I’m left a little confused from that encounter? Are we friends? Why didn’t you let me have my time and space if so? Why the rush ? 

I then ask him to come to a group event ( with friends so it’s not just me and him) - and he says he’s busy .

He then doesn’t really address a last message I sent him and that’s that. 

A week or two later I bump into him on the bus, I end the phonecall I was on and sit next to him and make conversation - ask him how his housemates are , work , that trip he had planned with his mum… - he’s aloof and distant, maybe a bit nervous ? I get off the bus and don’t know what to think - so we’re not friends? I’d finally gotten over most of my feelings for him at this point.

He doesn’t text for a couple of weeks and I don’t either - I to be honest think that’s that- not sure what came over him when he asked me for a coffee but he doesn’t like me and the friend thing isn’t working for him clearly. 

Fast forwards on a random Wednesday he txts me in the afternoon and says “ you free this afternoon” - veryyy out of the blue.
I say I’m busy as I’m off to the cinema , why? 
He said he wants and adventure cos it’s nice weather out and wondered if I, along with housemates if they wanted, would like to go on a stroll. 

Anyway I don’t see him that day cos I’m busy but he texts me again the next day asking if I want to come to the pub with one of his mates. I say I’m already off to a pub with my mates ( whom he’s not met at all by the way) - he proceeds to call me ( hadn’t really done that before) and then texts me where we’re going and whether there’s space for two ( he and his housemate) on our quiz team.

So he kind of invites himself along to the pub quiz with my mates - I will say, he was aware I was leaving for a month the next day and I have this nagging feeling he was there to see me before I left? He was very polite and friendly with my friends - really tried to make conversation with them and paid me much attention. He was lightly touchy as well ( hand on my back and on my hand ) and I just don’t know what to make of it. 

I’m really not sure what to make of it, I dislike how what he says doesn’t really match his actions - he says he wants to be friends but then to me it seems like this is more? Why the rush when I said I needed time and space? Why be touchy if you don’t mean anything by it? 

My current opinion of him is that he’s a very intelligent and nice guy, I don’t think he means to come across as manipulative but he just doesn’t express his emotions well at all?

The Link Between Mental Health and Fatigue,"If you feel exhausted all the time, even after a full night’s sleep, you’re not alone. Millions of young adults struggle with ongoing fatigue, low energy, and a persistent sense of exhaustion that can’t be fixed with coffee or rest. And often, the root cause isn’t just physical. Mental health challenges like depression, anxiety, trauma, and stress can drain your energy as much as any physical illness.

The answer to the question, “Why am I so tired all the time?” is a nuanced combination of environmental, biological, and psychological factors. Some of these factors can be addressed through changes to your routine, but fatigue can often signal more serious underlying mental health concerns, such as depression.

No Smoke, Vape  
Light drinking (beer, occasional whiskey)  
No Rec Drugs

About a month ago I had an episode of nausea followed by a single event of vomiting what appeared to be “coffee grounds.” I went to the ER after reading that this can sometimes indicate GI bleeding.

At the ER, they ran a full set of labs (CBC, CMP, Lipase, etc.) and everything came back normal. No imaging was done, and I had no abdominal pain, no ongoing nausea, and no other GI symptoms before or after. They noted I had just consumed coffee, water, and ibuprofen prior to the event, and felt that I may have just vomited coffee itself, and not blood. I was discharged with no medications and told to follow up with my PCP.

My primary care doctor later ordered an H. pylori breath test, which was also negative.

So my question is: Is it plausible that this was just an unusual, benign event (or even a mistaken perception of what I saw in the vomit)? Or should I be pushing for further GI workup even though I've had no recurrence?

(Rewritten by AI for clarity and grammar)

P.S I eat a lot of spicy foods. Not what I feel would be enough to cause issues, but It's not uncommon for me to order a spicy chicken sandwich, or buffalo wings.

I also have a high stress job in real estate.

Now, in my journey, knowing that I can connect with female artist without the need to repress anything makes me feel, well, assured.
I have come to the realization that there is been the formation of a ""gaze"" or ""core"" that artists like Hayden have been a part of, it generally comes to the taste of queer and alternative people, you know the girl with layers of cardigans, hobnails boots and akg headphones? Or the guy with a blonde mullet and ripped jeans who is always sipping coffee and cigarrettes? The kind of music these people listen to.
The reason why I call it ""cool girl core"" it is because, even though some of the artist are not necessarily fenale (jeff buckley is there), they all speak to the female audiences and are know for showing up at our topsters, memes, etc (""loser oler sister core"" was my favorite lol).
So, which artists that share these ways do you people feel like sharing?

He initiated, planned dates, talked about the future and his past relationships (which ended because he ""just didn't love"" the women he was with and he has been enjoying being single for the past 3 years but wants a wife now), and seemed interested. Two months in, he brought up that we were in “different life stages” and questioned if I’d stay in our city or change my career path for him. I said I’d only consider that for the right person. Later he said he didn’t want me to resent him and ended things, offering FWB, which I declined.

Months later, he reached out again, and during a stressful grad school cycle, I agreed to casually see him. Later, I found a Facebook post by a woman saying he was toxic, caused her PTSD, led her on, said he wants marriage but only wants casual sex, and pushed her boundaries, and I also realized he was seeing her when he texted me.

Over time, he blurred the casual lines: asking me to stay over, inviting me to dinner after I got into grad school here, telling me id be a “loyal wife,” and he'd protect me, asking about my future plans, getting jealous when I got attention from other men, and being vulnerable about his struggles. He asked me what I thought about potentially marrying him and that he ""kind of"" wants his own family now. His actions didn’t match his words, so I ended things. A month later, he texted that he was thinking about us and suggested we grab coffee and nothing ""sexual"" but never followed up, and we just chatted occasionally.

Later, more women commented on that FB post, saying he led them on or they were hooking up with him and wanted to know if he was dangerous. Close to starting grad school, I told him I wanted something serious and needed to end it for real. We had a long call where he said he’s looking for something serious “with the right person,” and that he’s a “good person” who had been hurt before by a woman and had to go to therapy for one year to work on his patterns of how he trusts people and that we should leave things on friendly terms and he understands i don’t want to hookup and he’ll never contact me again. He saidhe doesn’t want a heartbreak and wants to only start a relationship if he truly wants it. Eventually, he admitted he “just never felt the romantic connection” with me, maybe it was his fault too and we should have spent more tim but his intuition says he doesn't feel anything for me Although he thinks I’m a 10/10 and have my choice of men.

I’m glad he told me the truth, but I feel confused and doubt my judgment.

My mom raised me alone and we've been struggling financially for 21 years - constantly moving between rental homes because my dad never paid the court-ordered support he was supposed to. I've always had a pretty isolated childhood with very few close relationships.

Few years ago, this woman M (who's about 12 years older than me) became incredibly close to my mom and me. She would talk to my mom every day, and I grew really attached to her. She felt like the family I never had - we'd hang out together, go to movies, have meals. I even started calling her ""didi"", ""maa"" sometimes. She was very qualified and that too from one of the most premier institutes of the country, she has been a guide and inspiration for me.

For the first time in my life, I felt like I had a someone else to call family after my mom.

Then a month ago, M suddenly blocked us on WhatsApp out of nowhere. I was completely heartbroken because I'm so attached to her. We could still talk on Instagram and calls, but she lied to us (her phone broke) and we were blocked on WhatsApp.

I ended up going through my mom's phone (I know, not great) and discovered something that completely shocked me. Turns out I have two older step-brothers from my mom's previous marriage when she was 16. I barely remembered them from early childhood, but my memory had gotten fuzzy over the years. And M? She was dating my eldest step-brother.

M had lost her own mother when she was young, and she was searching for family connections when she found my mom on social media. She tried to help reconcile my mom with my step-brother by reaching out, my mom made his favorite food and sent him through her.  
But my step-brother still harbors intense hatred toward my mom and me too probably

They eventually broke up and he is dating someone else but he forced M to block us on WhatsApp, made her send him screenshots as proof, and made her promise she'd never contact us again.

M told me she'd stay in touch outside of WhatsApp, and we even went for coffee where she said I remind her of my step-brother and that our characteristics match exactly. But now she rarely picks up my calls and mostly ghosts my texts and Instagram messages.

I'm realizing that she probably always just saw me as her boyfriend's step-brother, while I thought of her as genuine family. Having endured a lot of childhood trauma and struggling to make close friends, losing this relationship has completely broken me. I don't know if she'll ever come back into our lives or if we're permanently distanced.

I'm just looking for advice on how to cope with this. Should I try reaching out to my step-brother? Is there any way to save things with M? How do I even process all these family secrets? I feel completely lost right now.

One night, as rain streaked the windows and his desk lamp buzzed like an angry wasp, inspiration struck. His pencil flew over paper, lines rising and curving into a face. She emerged from graphite: luminous eyes, delicate features, a beauty almost too perfect to exist. Leo stared at the portrait for hours, feeling like he’d conjured a muse from thin air.

Exhausted, he slumped forward onto the desk, cheek against the paper, and slipped into sleep.

She stood before him in a garden of ash-grey roses, moonlight washing over her hair. Her eyes shone like ice. When she spoke his name—“Leo”—something cracked open in his chest. He felt seen, understood, whole.

She touched his cheek. Her fingers were warm, electric.

But then she smiled, and her lips moved a fraction out of sync with her voice. A faint echo chased her words. Her touch lingered too long.

“Leo,” she whispered again, eyes widening, suddenly glassy.

Fear skittered through him. “Who are you?”

Her smile twitched at the corners. She stepped closer.

“No—” he breathed.

The garden twisted into darkness. Her body stretched, limbs bending like rubber. Her laugh rose in pitch, breaking into static.

He stumbled back, heart hammering. He tried to wake. Couldn’t.

Then his hands were at her throat. He screamed even as he strangled her, sobbing, telling himself to stop. But his fingers squeezed tighter until her body fell limp.

Leo jolted awake, gasping, tears streaming down his face. His hands trembled. His chest heaved as though he’d truly fought for his life.

Anna stirred on the bed behind him. “Leo…? Come back to bed.”

“I’m fine,” he rasped. “Just…working.”

He washed his face until the mirror blurred. Told himself it was just a nightmare. Nothing more. But even after he burned the drawing, the girl’s image remained etched behind his eyes.

He didn’t mean to fall asleep the next night, but exhaustion pulled him under.

He found himself on a quiet subway train. The girl waited in a flickering pool of light. She wore the same serene smile, but her lips still moved wrong, half a beat out of sync.

Leo tried to flee, but his feet carried him closer instead.

She reached out. “You came back.”

Her eyes flickered and split like mirrors, then reformed.

Panic flooded him. A gun appeared in his hand—cold, heavy.

“No,” he choked out. “I don’t want this.”

But his finger pulled the trigger.

Bang.

She crumpled to the floor.

He screamed himself awake, drenched in sweat.

This time, the guilt faded more slowly. He still felt shaken—but the horror was duller around the edges. The next morning, Anna tried to ask if he was okay. He barely met her eyes, mumbling that he was tired, that he had work to finish.

The days blurred together. Leo obsessed over redrawing the girl’s face. Sharpening lines, softening shadows, tweaking the curve of her smile. He convinced himself if he could just fix the drawing, the dreams would stop.

Each night, the dreams returned. Sometimes she awaited him in candlelit halls, sometimes under alien skies. Always beautiful. Always slightly off.

He still killed her each time, but the fear was fading. He no longer cried afterward. No longer pleaded with her to stay away.

Instead, he woke up cataloging the details. Her eyes were too cold. Her skin looked waxy. The laugh cracked wrong.

Anna noticed.

“You haven’t touched me in days,” she said one morning. Her voice was soft, almost breaking.

“I’m tired,” he muttered, not looking up from his paper. “I have to finish this.”

That night, he noticed half her closet was empty. He told himself he’d talk to her later.

The dreams multiplied.

He found himself on beaches under violet skies, in forests dripping golden sap, in crowded rooms where people wore paper masks. The girl always appeared, approaching him, whispering riddles, sometimes laughing too loudly, her voice echoing like a metal corridor.

He kept redrawing her: taller, shorter, new hairstyles, different eyes. But each time, something twisted her into terror. Each time, violence erupted out of him like instinct.

He began to suspect he wasn’t just killing the girl. He was killing the wrongness—the imperfection that reminded him she wasn’t real.

But each morning arrived, and he felt hollower than before.

Eventually, Leo didn’t even flinch when he killed her. One night, he throttled her so quickly it barely registered. No trembling hands. No screaming. Her blood spattered the dreamscape, and he simply stared at it, thinking how the color wasn’t quite right.

He hadn’t spoken to Anna in over a week.

One sleepless night, shaking from caffeine and exhaustion, Leo picked up his pencil and started to draw again.

But this time, he didn’t draw the strange girl.

He drew Anna.

Not idealized or stylized—just Anna as she truly was. Tired eyes, a freckle above her lip, the messy bun she twisted when she was focused. The small, quiet details he’d ignored for weeks.

It took hours. When he finished, he sat staring at the page, barely breathing.

He fell asleep with her face beneath his hand.

Anna stood on their apartment balcony, wearing her oversized NYU hoodie, hair tousled in the breeze. She turned to him with gentle, weary eyes.

“Leo,” she murmured, touching his cheek.

Her fingers were warm. Steady. No electric shock. No echo.

She kissed him. The air smelled like spring rain.

No blood. No gun. No terror.

Leo wept in the dream, overwhelmed with relief.

Morning light slanted across the room. Dust drifted like golden specks.

Leo finally stepped out of his room. The apartment felt foreign, still and echoing. Dirty dishes crusted with dried sauce filled the sink. Emails stacked up on his laptop, flagged URGENT. A notice from his college lay unopened on the table.

Anna’s side of the closet was bare.

On the kitchen table sat a single folded note. He picked it up with trembling fingers and read:

>

He sank into a chair, the portrait of Anna clutched in his hands. The paper was creased and smudged at the edges. He stared at it until his eyes blurred.

He whispered into the empty room:

>“But I finally got it right.”",1,1752070860.0,aiArt,1,1.0,False

She brushes her hair behind her ear
without a thought,
and I feel a pull in my chest 
like a tide I can’t control.

She’s simply human
barefoot in the kitchen,
soft-eyed in the morning,
but something in the way she exists
feels sacred.
Like a truth I don’t need to understand to believe in.

She has no altar, no crown,
No subjects to rule over
Only me;
watching the way she sips her morning coffee,
how she tucks her feet into the couch,
how her brow furrows when she’s lost in thought.

She reminds me of a goddess
not because she is distant,
but because she is here, 
Her divinity is palpable,
being near her feels like grace.

She laughs,
and suddenly the room feels lighter.
Like the moment before rain
when everything is held in a breath.

I sometimes say it out loud,
but I think it almost constantly:
She is the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen, 
even on the couch doing nothing.

My online friends are going through a lot and I don't wanna vent with them, and even worse with my irl friends. I don't wanna put the weight of my problems on them, but I like to help them to cope with theirs... It's kinda exhausting...

Anyways, today I was quite cheerful, energetic, and happy, talking with my two online best friends (one at the time ofc), but one of them, after a while just bursted on me saying that he sighed so hard and that I am fucking exhausting (I was joking with banging my head against the wall, guess it pissed him off or something). It just ruined my mood completely, even the effect of the coffeine (I drank coffee) just... Magically vanished. I'm so drained, upset and dizzy rn... I just wanna hurt myself, but I can't bring myself to do so, I'm just exhausted. It's amazing how BPD works. I wish I was normal and could control well this urges and emotions. But my therapist isn't calling me, and when I call her she ignores me. I have been without therapy around two months. Had a session just after 7 months without therapy too. I don't know what to do. Always the helper and sometimes helped. Cared about yet still feel empty. Void is slowly consuming me. I always try to be cheerful, but I'm just exhausted no matter what.",1,1752070710.0,venting,0,1.0,False
1lvjyu6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvjyu6,Star your Day in wellness mode 🍀,"🌅 5:30 AM - Where peak performance begins

As a wellness advocate and professional, I've discovered that my morning routine directly impacts my work performance. 8 years ago, I made a strategic decision to prioritize wellness - not just for personal health, but for professional excellence.

My performance-boosting morning ritual:

✨ 20 minutes of meditation for enhanced focus and decision-making
🍯 Warm lemon water with natural piloncillo for sustained energy (no afternoon crashes!)
🛒 Weekly farmers market visits - planning ahead for consistent nutrition
🧘‍♀️ 1 hour of yoga for stress resilience and mental clarity
💚 Fuel-focused eating that supports cognitive function

The professional impact has been transformative:

Sustained energy throughout 10-hour workdays
Enhanced focus during complex projects and meetings
Better stress management under tight deadlines
Improved emotional intelligence in team collaborations
Stronger immunity = fewer sick days and consistent productivity
Mental clarity that drives innovative problem-solving

The business case for wellness is clear: When we invest in our physical and mental health, we show up as our best professional selves. We make better decisions, communicate more effectively, and maintain the stamina needed for long-term career success.

For busy professionals feeling overwhelmed: You don't need to overhaul your entire routine overnight. Start with one small change - perhaps 5 minutes of deep breathing before your first meeting, or swapping your afternoon coffee for herbal tea.

The piloncillo I use isn't just about natural sweetening - it represents making conscious choices that support sustained performance rather than quick fixes that lead to energy crashes.

Your career deserves the best version of you. When we prioritize wellness, we're not just caring for ourselves - we're investing in our professional impact and long-term success.

What's one wellness practice that has improved your work performance? I'd love to hear how you integrate health into your professional routine.",1,1752070704.0,healthyfoodUSA,0,1.0,False

I’m heartbroken and wondering how can I move on?,"I (F24) dated a man (M34) last year. He initiated, planned dates, talked about the future and his past relationships (which ended because he ""just didn't love"" the women he was with and he has been enjoying being single for the past 3 years but wants a wife now), and seemed interested. Two months in, he brought up that we were in “different life stages” and questioned if I’d stay in our city or change my career path for him. I said I’d only consider that for the right person. Later he said he didn’t want me to resent him and ended things, offering FWB, which I declined.

Months later, he reached out again, and during a stressful grad school cycle, I agreed to casually see him. Later, I found a Facebook post by a woman saying he was toxic, caused her PTSD, led her on, said he wants marriage but only wants casual sex, and pushed her boundaries, and I also realized he was seeing her when he texted me.

Over time, he blurred the casual lines: asking me to stay over, inviting me to dinner after I got into grad school here, telling me id be a “loyal wife,” and he'd protect me, asking about my future plans, getting jealous when I got attention from other men, and being vulnerable about his struggles. He asked me what I thought about potentially marrying him and that he ""kind of"" wants his own family now. His actions didn’t match his words, so I ended things. A month later, he texted that he was thinking about us and suggested we grab coffee and nothing ""sexual"" but never followed up, and we just chatted occasionally.

Later, more women commented on that FB post, saying he led them on or they were hooking up with him and wanted to know if he was dangerous. Close to starting grad school, I told him I wanted something serious and needed to end it for real. We had a long call where he said he’s looking for something serious “with the right person,” and that he’s a “good person” who had been hurt before by a woman and had to go to therapy for one year to work on his patterns of how he trusts people and that we should leave things on friendly terms and he understands i don’t want to hookup and he’ll never contact me again. He saidhe doesn’t want a heartbreak and wants to only start a relationship if he truly wants it.  Eventually, he admitted he “just never felt the romantic connection” with me, maybe it was his fault too and we should have spent more tim but his intuition says he doesn't feel anything for me Although he thinks I’m a 10/10 and have my choice of men. 

I’m glad he told me the truth, but I feel confused and doubt my judgment. I thought when a man plans dates, invites you to dinner, shares struggles, and calls you a “loyal wife,” it means he’s interested. Maybe I shouldn't have read those signs that way? How do I avoid getting confused in the future, and how can I trust my judgment with men going forward?",1,1752070673.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False
1lvjyak,https://i.redd.it/6ufv0anmxubf1.jpeg,Breville Smart Grinder to Mazzer Philos!,"After 5 years I finally took the plunge and upgraded my Breville Smart Grinder to the Mazzer Philos.
Wanted to thank Tom’s YouTube channel and fellow Redditors on this subreddit that made me land on this.
Originally I looked at the Varia VS6 but after reading and seeing so many people have mixed reviews with the QS I decided to go to spend more on this hand built Italian beauty. 
After running approx 2kg of Costco beans I had sitting around I am currently trying to dial in but not sure whether I am not tamping or over tamping which is causing inconsistency with my shots. Beans were roasted on the 25th of June. 

The setup:
It’s currently set on 21 clicks on the Mazzer Philos with 200d burrs, MH3 Bomber Dex 20g precision basket, Normcore WDT Tool and Normcore V2 Tamp, Breville Dual Boiler.

Process: weigh 20g, comes out 20g after a few knocks and using the tool. Sometimes .2g to .3G off if I don’t use the tool. Use the WDT and then tamp and boom it goes in machine. Sometimes the bar starts and 11 and sometimes it goes under 9 just ever so slightly and sometimes it’s perfect pull.

Question is… is it just my WDT and tamping technique? And should I just get a distribution tool.

Lastly anyone else finding coffee grind sticks to the steel cup when you are emptying into portafilter.

Again this machine is just a beauty and will post a proper review once I have everything down pat (more a me problem then equipment).
