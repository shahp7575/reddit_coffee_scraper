1hnvunh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hnvunh/how_to_go_about_this_dating_gone_backwards/,How to go about this? Dating gone backwards.,"Basically I'm going on my first date with a girl but I've sort of done things backwards and I'm not sure how best to approach it.

I (19M) met her (20F) on a night out a couple of weeks back, and there was an instant attraction from both ends. We ended up both leaving our groups and just hanging out with each other, leading up to us making out quite a few times in the one night.

I kind of knew her from my university course, and always thought she was pretty but drunk confidence made me make a move and it worked really well.

We continued talking after that night as I genuinely felt a really good connection, and sparks have continued flying. It started out with some light hearted chat about music and how good the night out was, but recently it's progressed into really flirty texts, referencing our night out, but also more intimate acts like sex.

It's been so fun texting her and again the flirting has been reciprocated on both sides. We are currently in other parts of the world, but plan to meet for coffee when next semester starts, we're both calling it a date and we both seem really excited for it.

Problem is, I have no idea how to approach things ;)

Usually when I date someone, I'll meet them on the first date after talking and work up to making a move, this time things have happened in the opposite way and I'm wondering what that might mean for it.

Any advice on how best to handle this would be so appreciated, I really like talking to her and wanna try my best to make something of this.",1,1735353516.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1hnvtvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hnvtvs/need_advice_on_family_stuff_and_burnout/,need advice on family stuff and burnout,"hello! 


this is my first post on here. i’m just seeking some advice for my current situation. i’m burnt out and overwhelmed so idk how much all of this will make sense. also, i have a therapist and all that but just need some advice on this situation since im expected to give an answer as to my availability…


so basically— i don’t wanna spend time with my family but feel guilty if i dont. 

my family overwhelms me very easily, along with triggering me (i have ptsd and very complicated family history). i do not have a good family dynamic but we try to make it work, i try to show up at least to the big family gathering at christmas, i mostly show up to see and spend time with my grandpa who’s my only living grandparent. 

My mom always makes me feel like shit if i don’t show up to things and feels like she has to make excuses for me— my family doesn’t really take no as an answer as it makes them uncomfortable for some reason. Like i tell my boyfriend all the time flat out that i don’t wanna go to things and i can always be honest with him but with my family, they get so offended by these things. 

For some reason my aunts are weirdly obsessed with spending time with me and like a lot of other people do— they think of me as this weird like pokémon they need to catch. like they have to spend time with me so they can brag to someone that they did— it’s so weird idk if this make sense. 

Basically— i just had christmas with my family and my overbearing aunt wants to spend time with me again, which will snowball into her constantly asking me to go out to coffee or do things alone with her (which i only do with a tiny amount of people). My aunt asked for us to do a girls night with all the girls in my family— i’ve gotten out of doing this before, because to be frank i am not interested. this actually happens like every few years, my aunt gets obsessed and pushes to hang out with my and constantly talks to my mom about me until my mom tells her to lay off, then she does and barely contacts me… just for christmas to come back up and the cycle continues. 

also— im sober and my family drinks a lot during family gatherings and i hate being around drunk obnoxious people, knowing that they’ll be drinking and it’ll be a late night activity makes me want to go even less.

 I often tell my mom im interested in shorter activities like going out to coffee for an hour— that way i have control over when i leave and don’t have to make excuses. 

so basically— Should i be honest and tell my mom i don’t want to go because im burnt out and that i don’t wanna do things alone with my aunt? or should i just make an excuse. the excuse is so much easier in my brain. 


i might end up deleting this since it’s just me rambling, doesn’t make sense and is a bit personal, so if ur still reading and or give me advice— thank you. ",1,1735353444.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

The kitchen. The Tuckers weren't particularly healthy eaters, with the pantry stocked full of sugary treats, crisps, coffee and dried fruit (like any other place with food packaging in the game tbh.) They cooked in large batches, as evidenced by the large pots on the stove.

Tuck probably knows a thing or two about farming, with her crops are thriving even after 2 years of being abandoned. So why the hell did she settle on Hot Springs?

1hnvrsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hnvrsc/dont_trust_the_other_you_in_the_mirror/,Don’t Trust the Other “You” in the Mirror,"I’m not sure when she stopped loving me. Maybe when I was laid off from work. Or when I was hospitalised for my mental break. Or maybe when she started fucking her PT, Mathew. Who knows? All is know is that when she ended it, it broke me.

The thought of life without her was incomprehensible to me. Alicia and I had been together since we were 15 - High school sweethearts. When we were both 19, I proposed. I still remember how scared I was. God, I was a fumbling mess. But regardless, somehow she said yes, and we began our life together. That was 16 years ago. We were inseparable. Unstoppable. That was until June of this year… It replays in my mind over and over. 

In January, I was laid off from work. Something about cutting costs, you know, the usual shit they hit you with. Unfortunately that didn’t stop the bills rolling in. The mortgage still needed to be paid, food still had to be put on the table and her handmade jewellery business wasn’t even coming close to covering it. I had always said I would provide for her so she could pursue what she loved to do. Yet here I was, being turned down for every job I applied for, taking out loans anywhere that would allow me to, borrowing from anyone I could. But still, we were days from losing the house. The stress was too much - The guilt was too much. So much so, that in March I found myself walking down a busy highway. No clothes, no shoes, and no recollection of how I got there. 

A passerby had alerted the police, who promptly took me to the local hospital. I was tested for alcohol and drugs but was found to be completely sober. That’s when they came to the conclusion I had suffered a mental break due to stress and sent me to the closest mental health facility. After seeing movies like One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Girl, Interrupted, I really didn’t have high hopes for this place, but much to my surprise, it was great. The doctors and nurses were incredibly helpful, the therapy sessions were wonderful and the other patients were people just like me, who had just lost their way. Alicia had come to visit me a few times but she seemed..off. Cold even. I put it down to me overthinking with my current state of mind.

After a few months, they had finally found medication that suited me, and coping techniques that helped me calm down. I was finally going home - Going home to Alicia. And I couldn’t wait. That is however, until I got home and realised her demeanour I felt at the hospital and put down to my overthinking, was in fact, very real. She looked at me differently. Stopped talking to me unless absolutely necessary. Started going to the gym more than she was home. Then finally in mid June, she hit me with the 5 words I dreaded the most.

“I can’t do this anymore”

My heart sank and my knees buckled. I couldn’t stop the flood of tears leaking from my eyes. 

“Please, I’ll do anything! Just give me another chance!” I pled. I must have looked so pathetic - But I was so overcome with emotion. She’s was my everything. My reason for living. I couldn’t remember life before her. But her expression never changed. She wouldn’t even look at me.

“I’m sorry. I’ve met someone else. I tried. I really did. But you’ve changed. You’re not the man I remember. You’re like a shell of him. I love you. I always will. But it’s not enough”

Truth be told, I saw this coming and yet still was somehow caught off guard by it. And with that, she turned and picked up two bags, already packed by the doorway - I hadn’t even noticed them. And that was it. I was alone. Alone for the first time in my life. No one to turn to. My parents were long gone by now and any friends I had drifted away from me when I was hospitalised or when I had text them constantly asking to borrow money. But I at least had my weekly therapy sessions.

“You know it’s not your fault Adam. You need to stop blaming yourself” Dr McAllister said in a reassuring tone, gazing at me over the top frame of her glasses, notebook and pen in hand. “Unfortunately things like this happen, but we have to find a way to go on. Have you been doing those written exercises I recommended?”

“Yeah..” I muttered while staring at the carpet. It was so filthy and cheap looking - When was the last time it was vacuumed? And god, that smell. What I assumed to be some fruity scented candle that was so overpowering it was sickening.

“Have you been taking your medication?”Dr McAllister said in a condescending tone. 

I could tell by the way she asked, she doubted me.

“Ofcourse I have” I snapped. “But pills can’t fix everything”

Dr McAllister sighed. “Listen Adam. Between you and I, I’ve been through more break ups than I’d like to admit - Even one divorce. Every single one feels like the end of the world. Trust me, I know. But somehow we find a way to carry on. It takes time and a lot of strength, but we manage eventually. I wish I could give you some amazing advice that would instantly take away your pain - but I’m just a therapist, I don’t have a magic wand. Unfortunately when it comes to something like this, it’s something you have to get through on your own. The tunnel will be long and dark, but there is light at the end, and you will make it”

“Wow, thanks Dr McAllister - I could have got that advice in any bullshit woman’s lifestyle magazine” I thought to myself as I sauntered out of her bleak, fruity smelling office. I left the office and let out a huge sigh. What a waste of time. I had no choice but to go home and resort to my new nightly routine - Two six packs and hours of video games. It was my way of shutting my brain off for a few hours. I walked into my eerily empty, silent house, kicked my shoes off and threw my keys in the bowl by the door. I threw my jacket on the couch and made my way to the kitchen. 

The dishes were piled high - honestly the house was a mess. Alicia would be disgusted. But I don’t care. There’s no one here to see the mess I live in - the mess I am.

I made my way to fridge and grabbed a can of Miller. I don’t particularly care for the taste, but it was cheap and I certainly wasn’t oozing money. I had a divorce to pay for. A house to try and save. I was living on ramen for gods sake. Safe to say I was flat broke. I continued into the living room and threw myself onto the couch with a thud, staring at the dimly lit ceiling. I had made a habit of turning on as little lights as possible. I had to save the electricity money and to be honest, I always found the dark quite comforting.

I wasted hours wandering around in Elden Ring til’ I couldn’t keep my eyes open any longer. Might as well try to sleep. I got up to turn off the tv as I had lost the remote to a moment of rage a couple of weeks back. I stumbled to the tv and shot a glance towards the mirror above the fireplace. I never understood the whole ‘mirror over the fireplace’ thing . A lot of people aren’t even tall enough to see themselves in it - Alicia was one of them. But she insisted on putting this huge vintage rectangular mirror with a gold baroque border above the fireplace. I always found it tacky, but according to her - I just had no taste.

I looked at my reflection and squinted. What happened to me? My face was covered in stubble, my eyes had huge black rings around them, my hair was longer than it should be and completely unkempt. I was disgusting. I stared at myself in awe. I became completely lost in my reflection when suddenly - I smiled. Well, I didn’t - my reflection did. At least I think it did? Nah, I must have imagined it. I probably should stop drinking on these meds.

I turned the tv off and slowly thudded my way up the stairs. I threw myself in my unmade mess of a bed and stared up at the ceiling - like I always did until I would fall asleep. But sleep never came. I couldn’t stop thinking. I couldn’t get that face out of my head - My face. But he looked so full of life. So alive. Not like me. Not like the shell I had apparently become.. I had to look again. I thudded back down the stairs and into the living room, feeling completely ridiculous as I did so - but I had to see. 

I found myself in-front of the mirror I hated so much, staring with anticipation. And after a few minutes, there he was, mirror-me, the man I wanted to be. I stared into his eyes and everything went numb. Minutes passed, hours passed- and next thing I knew, the sun had risen. It was morning. I had stood there all night, and was now looking back at that shell of a man, the me I hated - The real me. I felt absolutely insane. How could I stand there all night? Was I hallucinating? Had I officially lost it? 

The weirdest part was that I felt..comforted. Cathartic. The way you feel after you’ve told someone something you’ve never told anyone before - Like a huge weight was off my shoulders. The pain I had been feeling, the self loathing - it was all gone. It was like a high. That high was short lived however, because the tiredness of not sleeping all night finally hit me like a hard punch to the face. I made my way upstairs and fell asleep the minute I hit the pillow. When I woke, it was already evening. I stared at the time on my phone in shock. Since Alicia had left, I hadn’t managed more than a few hours, but today? Twelve. Twelve whole hours. Probably not considered healthy, but god, did I need it. 

I headed downstairs, into the kitchen and grabbed myself a drink of water. I stood against the worktop, sipping my water and flipping through Facebook. I really wish I hadn’t..

There she was. Alicia. And there he was - the home wrecking bastard, with his arm around her. They were smiling from ear to ear, with a beautiful sunset behind them. It was so generically cheesy - But I was overcome with rage and jealousy. She never looked that happy with me. Never. Had our relationship ment nothing to her? Was I that easy to forget? Did our vows even mean anything?  In sickness and in health? - Apparently not. For richer, for worse? - Ha, yeah right. I gripped the glass so hard, I felt it crack beneath my fingers. 

I needed him.
I needed mirror-me.

I ran to the mirror and stared at him, hands bracing the shelf above the fireplace, rocking and forth. Rage coursing through me - Then, again after a few moments - he appeared. Same smile. Same reassuring eyes - And I was numb again. Pure bliss. 

This became my daily routine. Sleep, eat and spend time with mirror-me. He was my safe space. My sanctuary. My best friend. I didn’t need anyone else. I didn’t need to feel or think. He started appearing to me on all the mirrors I had in the house - so I was never alone. And every day that I saw him, his smile seemed even bigger. The only downfall was, everyday after my “mirror therapy”, when the sun rose, the wave of tiredness that hit me was worse than the day before . I wasn’t even making it to the bed anymore. I was just sleeping on the couch.

It was now early October. The dark nights were getting longer, which ment more time with mirror-me. It was great. Even if his smile had now gotten unsettlingly big. I stared into his eyes and lost myself - like I did every night, when suddenly I was shocked back to into reality by a cheerful jingle. I glanced around the room in a confused daze. What the hell was that? It took me a few seconds to come to the realisation, it was my phone! I can’t remember the last time it went. I almost forgot what it sounded like. I scrambled over to my phone and was instantly taken aback to see who was calling. A picture of Alicia and I filled the screen. What the fuck does she want?

I took a deep breath and answered. 

“Adam?” She enquired. I expected hearing her voice to send me into a spiral, but I felt nothing. Nada. Not a thing.
“Adam? Are you there?”

“What do you want Alicia?” I bluntly asked.

She sounded caught off guard. “There’s no need to be hostile - I know we left each other on bad terms, but I just wanted to check on you. I passed the house a few times this week and the house was in complete darkness. Are you o-“

“I’m fine” I snapped. “And how I am or what I’m doing is no longer your concern, nor is it your busin-“

“Adam” Alicia interjected. “we may not be together anymore - but I still care about you! I couldn’t live with myself knowing you were sitting suffering! I-“

I interrupted her with hysterical laughter. “You care about me? Did you care about me when you were disappearing to fuck him?- in-fact, you know what? I don’t care. I don’t care any more. I’m not wasting my breath on you. I don’t need you. I don’t need anyone. I hate you, and I genuinely hope the rest of your life is full of misery and suffering”

I was met with silence from the other end of the phone. I broke it by delivering one final blow. 

“Now if you’re done snooping to see if I’m still pining after you, I’d like to go and get back to enjoying my freedom. I don’t want to hear your shrill voice in my ears again. You make me sick”. And with that, I hung up.

I was shocked at myself - Yeah I was mad at her, sure. But I still loved her. Why did I talk to her like that? I would never talk to her like that. That was when I realised, I was smiling. So hard it hurt my cheeks I turned to mirror and noticed I was smiling just like him, and instead of the comfort it usually gave me - it filled me with unease. Something felt wrong. Very wrong. I slowly stood up and backed out of the room. I needed to get to a room without a mirror. I needed to be alone for a minute. I needed to be away from him. I ran to our spare room. I knew that was mirror free at least. I sat on the end of the bed. I don’t understand what’s going on. I don’t know what to do. I can’t exactly call the police and tell them I think there’s something wrong with the ‘me’ in the mirror. Nor can I call my therapist, cause the only help I’ll get is a straight jacket and a padded room. So I turned to the only place I could - The internet. There are all sorts of people on there, surely at least one is bound to believe me or know something.

And so I googled about mirror entities, demons - what ever I could think of and scoured the results from top to bottom. That’s when I saw a post on a forum amply titled “Don’t trust the other you in the mirror”. I stared in awe. I don’t like the sound of this.. I clicked and began to read. The post was by a user named “Spiritwalker67”.

It read:

“Ok, I know I’m going to sound insane, but I couldn’t live with myself if I knew I hadn’t at least tried to warn others.

I had been attending AA meetings regularly. I had hit rock bottom and was really struggling. I was at my lowest when a woman named Tina approached me and asked if we could be each other sponsors. I wasn’t super into the idea but I was willing to try.

She was lovely and really seemed to have it together. So much that I honestly wondered why she was even there. It was during our fourth phone call that she told me something I wish she hadn’t. She could tell I was sinking further and had a suggestion for me. 

“I know this is going to sound crazy, but please don’t dismiss it without trying at least once.” 

I was already rolling my eyes but I thought I’d hear her out. I was desperate. That’s when she told me about something she had named “mirror therapy”. She told me to dim the lights in my apartment and stare at myself in a mirror and meditate. Lose myself. She again stated she knew how crazy this sounded but assured me that the sense of inner peace I would feel would be worth it.

Fuck it, as I said, I was desperate. I figured I’d try. And much to my amazement, it worked, beyond belief. Not only that but I felt like my reflection was staring at me with kind reassurance. The look I had so wished my family and friends had given me. 

I became addicted to mirror therapy. I lived for it. However I noticed that when I wasn’t at the mirror I was overcome with lethargy. It was unbearable. If I left the house, I was like a zombie. It wasn’t until I went to AA a few weeks later and saw Tina, that I put two and two together.

Tina wandered in, but she wasn’t her usual odd, quirky self. No, she was.. empty. Dazed. I walked up to her to ask if she was ok and audibly gasped when she turned to face me with a face like a blank sheet of paper and eyes with no shine or life in them. She was like ..an empty vessel. And that’s when it started to come together. My lethargy, Tina’s zombie-like state. It was the mirrors. It had to be. I had no other explanation. I refused to believe Tina had relapsed or anything like that because she was doing so well and really had her mind set on getting her life together.

I didn’t know where to turn - the internet was providing nothing, so I went to the only other place I could think of for answers. The library.

I scoured the occult section from top to bottom for any mention of mirrors, it was the only place I could think to look and eventually I found something. And it filled me with anxiety. It spoke about spirits within the mirror and how when you were at your most vulnerable the veil between us and them was in a weakened state. It went on to explain that everytime you look into the mirror or “other realm”, the being at the other side takes pieces of your soul, until eventually there’s nothing left, and you are empty. The only way to save yourself is to close their doorway forever. In other words- break all your mirrors. It’s that simple. And so I headed home and did just that. Within weeks my energy came back, and I was back to my old struggling self, which I never thought I’d miss.

Again -  I know I sound insane, but in hopes I reach just one stranger out there, going through what Tina and I went through, please take my advice and don’t trust the other you in the mirror. Destroy it before it destroys you”

I sat there with my mouth agape. I was shocked, scared and for some reason, felt betrayed. Even though mirror me never spoke, I still felt like he had lied to me. He had given me a false sense of security, made me feel like I had a friend - I had no choice but to say goodbye to the friend I had counted on for months, who never judged me or made me feel crazy. But I couldn’t say goodbye without first confronting him. Stupid - I know, it’s not like he was going to answer me. But I had to get it off my chest and I at least needed this relationship to have some closure.

I wandered back down the stairs - slowly walking, eyes to the ground, towards the mirror. I couldn’t help but feel heartbreak. I slowly rose my eyes to the fireplace mirror I had grown to love and was greeted by my familiar comforting face. His smile was even bigger than last time. Now that I knew what I did about him, that smile made me incredibly uncomfortable.

I looked him in the eyes.

“I know what you are. I know what you’re doing. I’m sorry, but I can’t let you have me” My eyes fell to the ground. “Even knowing what you are, I still can’t help but want to thank you. You were the only one who was there for me at my lowest. I won’t forget you”

I looked up to meet his gaze one last time and felt the most intense fear I have ever felt surge through my body. That smile - that smile was gone. Now he was frowning. Not just frowning, it was indescribable. Full of anger. It was evil. His eyes were so wide they looked like they were about pop out of his head at any moment. But I couldn’t look away. That’s when he did something that made me feel fear like I had never felt before. His eyes got wider and his mouth began to open, wider and wider. Not horizontally like a smile, but vertically. Wider than was humanly possible. I took a step back trying not to take my eyes off him as I mindlessly reached around the room trying to grab anything heavy enough to shatter that god awful face. My aimless flailing was getting me nowhere, and I adverted my gaze for less than a second to grab the huge ugly candle holder on the coffee table that Alicia had got one Christmas from her mother. As I turned back to throw it, I was met with something I couldn’t believe I was seeing. Hands. So many hands. Seeping from every part of the mirror, reaching for me, grabbing for me. I closed my eyes tightly and threw a Hail Mary. I couldn’t open my eyes. I just prayed and waited for the obscene amount of hands to grab me and do whatever they were going to do to me. When suddenly, the sound of glass cracking. A beautiful choir of shattering. I opened my eyes to see that mirror I had grown so fond of had broken into a hundred pieces. I had never felt such relief. I exhaled hard. It was like i had been holding my breath for what felt like minutes without even realising. I ran upstairs and smashed all the other small mirrors that remained within the house without looking at them. It was done. It was over.

And with that. He was gone- Forever. My friend. My therapist. My mirror-me. 

My energy gradually returned to me over the weeks - and so did my pain and sadness. But I’d rather feel that than nothing at all. I still see him in my dreams though. Almost every night actually. Sometimes he has that comforting smile I had grown so attached to, but other times he had that god awful stretched, otherworldly mouth and frightfully wide eyes. I hate those dreams. But at least I’m alive - Soul-intact - and starting to get my life back on track little by little.

So, I’ll leave you with this - the same advice “Spiritwalker67” gave me, which saved my life.

No matter how good it makes you feel.
No matter how amazing at peace you are.

1hnvrdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1hnvrdm/bleaching_possible/,Bleaching possible?,"Hello everyone,

I have a question about teeth whitening and hope someone here might know more about it (maybe even a dentist).

Over the years, my coffee consumption has caused my teeth to yellow a bit, and I’d like to have a bleaching treatment done. However, my dentist mentioned that it could cost around 4,000 euros. The reason for this is an old dental injury:

In my early twenties, I had an accident on a dance floor and lost half of one of my front teeth and a canine tooth (bottle, elbow, tooth – you can imagine the rest). Since then, I’ve had composite fillings on both teeth, which look great aesthetically.

My dentist explained that during the bleaching process, the composite material wouldn’t lighten. Her solution would be to remove the composite, whiten the teeth, and then place new fillings in a lighter shade. That makes sense to me so far.

However, she also said that the composite wouldn’t stain from future coffee consumption, which could create a color difference between the natural teeth and the composite. This part doesn’t make much sense to me because, before I started drinking coffee, the composite definitely discolored over the years. Back then, my teeth were bright white, and the discoloration only came later—something the composite also seemed to pick up. So, it appears that composite material can discolor, right? She claimed it doesn’t and assured me that the composite was initially placed in that shade.

I also asked her if the bleaching process could damage the composite or the bond between the tooth and the filling, but she said that wouldn’t happen.

Now I’m wondering if I’m being offered an unnecessarily expensive treatment because I’m 100% sure that no yellow-tinted composite was placed back then, and my teeth, along with the composite, definitely discolored over the years. Additionally, I’d like to know if the bleaching process could harm the composite material.

Although I haven’t received my score yet, I wanted to share my experience to help others preparing for the exam.

General Tips:
Take Breaks Between the Two Days (If Possible):
The exam is long and mentally exhausting. A break between the two days can help you recharge and maintain stamina.

Use the 45 min+ tutorial break for MCQ 6 blocks:
The 45-minute tutorial can be skipped to add more break time. I used this for the six MCQ blocks, which was extremely helpful.

CCS Strategy:
Cases end Early – If you complete a case before the allotted time, the remaining time gets added to subsequent cases. This is a great way to accumulate extra minutes for breaks

Back-to-Back CCS Cases: I chose to complete all my CCS cases in one go because I just wanted to finish the exam and leave the center. I ended up finishing about 45 minutes early.

MCQ Blocks (Day 2):
Each block of 30 MCQs felt more manageable compared to Day 1. I consistently had 2-3 minutes left at the end of each block, unlike the first day, where I often ran out of time.

Exam Content & Preparation:
Topics Covered: There were no questions on drug ads, biostats, or mechanisms of action (MOA). However, Step 1 content like microbiology and pharmacology still appeared. Know your ENT ophtha well too. Basically expect questions from each system even Biochem or immuno.

Preparation Resources:
I relied heavily on my job experience, USCE, and general exam prep, as no Qbank seemed to fully prepare me for this section.
Key PDFs to review include:

Mehlman Risk PDF

Divine PDF

The Collective PDF (floating around online)

Question Themes: A significant portion of the exam focused on prognosis and the natural course of conditions.

If Unsure of an Answer: When in doubt, lean toward answers that suggest:
Spontaneous resolution, 
Reassurance and 
Normal aging
(This won’t always be correct, but it’s often better than selecting invasive options unless you’re certain.)

Integrating CCS Knowledge with MCQs:

CCS Practice: While solving CCS cases, I made note of tests and treatments suggested by UWorld, treating them as part of my differential diagnosis process.
Practical Application: For example:
A 30-year-old female with vaginal bleeding doesn’t need an endometrial biopsy unless risk factors are present or she is over 40. This detail helped during MCQs.
Similarly, I reinforced the differences in treatment for cystitis vs. pyelonephritis (avoid nitrofurantoin for pyelo and ceftriaxone for cystitis).

Final Thoughts:
Rest and Breaks: The exam is exhausting, so take full advantage of breaks – have coffee, wash your face, and reset.

Don't Overthink Answers: Avoid checking your answers afterward. It won’t change the outcome.

Stay Positive and Calm: Relax, pray, and trust your preparation. Good luck to everyone preparing – and to me while I wait for my results!

1hnvocl,https://www.reddit.com/r/girladvicefromgirls/comments/1hnvocl/been_advice_on_men/,Been advice on men ,"I need advice , sooo there is this guy.

I have developed a crush on but I am unsure  if he is just nice or flirting. Ahhhhhhhh 

I have had a situation similar (everyone thought he liked me (even my teachers in High school lol), he was touchy, always complemented me , wanted to be alone and he was a very shy guy, so anyways, we went out for coffee which I thought was a date, turns out … it wasn’t … I told him I liked him and he said he didn’t like me in that way etc…) 

Now back to the present… lol 

This guy (different one) is super nice to everyone just his personality but sometimes I feel like it’s a bit more (my friend I go to uni with said don’t read into it because he is nice , and sometimes he will pat her on the back too). 
However, it’s been more, always wanting to hang out.  I am just stupid sometimes maybe to think , just maybe he might like me . Idk wtf is wrong with me lol. 

he will ask me personal questions where everyone else don’t (guys). 

I asked him if he was dating anyone , he said no , it’s been 8 years when he was in high school. 
His girlfriend broke up with him due to him being an  asshole back then. 

So I said I am sorry to hear that, he said he has been working on himself for the last 8 years , and a people pleaser kind of nice to make sure he doesn’t hurt anyone and to include everyone , so he is nice to everyone. 

But then…. My stupid brain and heart think it’s more when he …. 

Then he will brush together or when I passed my phone, he will brush my fingers. And smile . 
Again not sure if it’s by accident or . 

I feel like I am reading into more. But ever time I see him he makes me think it’s something more 

He is very cute too . 

Also, when we were in the lecture theatre (rows of seats) , a couple friends and I sat together. 

But at break the girls moved because we were sitting to close to the screen and it was hurting their necks. 

Anyways, 
But then I said to the gig  if it’s hurting your neck and you want to sit with them by all means go ahead. He said no I am fine sitting here , I said you’re sure Because it’s only us lol. I laughed out loud he said yes. T
hen he said it’s comfy here.  

Cause he could have moved because he was clearly uncomfortable sitting in that chair with his neck. But he choose to sit with me . So nice or just didn’t want to leave me alone . I guess. 

This week I am on winter break (or Christmas break), and he has been texting me lots , always him first never me. 
Just saying Wyd or heyy how are you? Etc. like everyday. 

Which is very not like him. 

So ya lol sorry for the long story. 

What y’all think?

1hnvkn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1hnvkn9/venting_frustrated_burnt_out/,venting— frustrated & burnt out ,"hello! 


this is my first post on here. i’m just seeking some advice for my current situation. i’m burnt out and overwhelmed so idk how much all of this will make sense. also, i have a therapist and all that but just need some advice on this situation since im expected to give an answer as to my availability…


so basically— i don’t wanna spend time with my family but feel guilty if i dont. 

my family overwhelms me very easily, along with triggering me (i have ptsd and very complicated family history). i do not have a good family dynamic but we try to make it work, i try to show up at least to the big family gathering at christmas, i mostly show up to see and spend time with my grandpa who’s my only living grandparent. 

My mom always makes me feel like shit if i don’t show up to things and feels like she has to make excuses for me— my family doesn’t really take no as an answer as it makes them uncomfortable for some reason. Like i tell my boyfriend all the time flat out that i don’t wanna go to things and i can always be honest with him but with my family, they get so offended by these things. 

For some reason my aunts are weirdly obsessed with spending time with me and like a lot of other people do— they think of me as this weird like pokémon they need to catch. like they have to spend time with me so they can brag to someone that they did— it’s so weird idk if this make sense. 

Basically— i just had christmas with my family and my overbearing aunt wants to spend time with me again, which will snowball into her constantly asking me to go out to coffee or do things alone with her (which i only do with a tiny amount of people). My aunt asked for us to do a girls night with all the girls in my family— i’ve gotten out of doing this before, because to be frank i am not interested. this actually happens like every few years, my aunt gets obsessed and pushes to hang out with my and constantly talks to my mom about me until my mom tells her to lay off, then she does and barely contacts me… just for christmas to come back up and the cycle continues. 

also— im sober and my family drinks a lot during family gatherings and i hate being around drunk obnoxious people, knowing that they’ll be drinking and it’ll be a late night activity makes me want to go even less.

 I often tell my mom im interested in shorter activities like going out to coffee for an hour— that way i have control over when i leave and don’t have to make excuses. 

so basically— Should i be honest and tell my mom i don’t want to go because im burnt out and that i don’t wanna do things alone with my aunt? or should i just make an excuse. the excuse is so much easier in my brain. 


i might end up deleting this since it’s just me rambling, doesn’t make sense and is a bit personal, so if ur still reading and or give me advice— thank you. ",3,1735352614.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False
1hnvjdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1hnvjdh/the_thing_in_the_mirror/,The Thing in the Mirror,"I’m writing this because I don’t think I have much time left. If I don’t make it through tonight, maybe someone will believe me. Or at least, they’ll know it wasn’t just grief that drove me mad.

It all started a week ago, when I rented the cabin.

I needed to get away. After Emily died—my wife—I couldn’t stand the suffocating silence of our house. Her coffee mug still sat in the sink, her books stacked on the nightstand. Everywhere I looked, I saw her absence. So, I packed a bag, found a cheap Airbnb in the mountains, and drove up with a single thought in my head: I needed to be alone.

The cabin wasn’t much. Just a squat little thing surrounded by trees that seemed to stretch endlessly in every direction. It smelled faintly of mildew when I walked in, but it was clean enough. There was a fireplace, a lumpy couch, and a small kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘80s. The bedroom was down a short hallway, past a single bathroom with one of those old-fashioned mirrors bolted to the wall above the sink.

It wasn’t glamorous, but it was quiet. That’s all I wanted.

The first night, I slept better than I had in months.

The second night was when I noticed the mirror.

I had been chopping vegetables for dinner, letting my mind wander, when I realized I hadn’t checked myself in a mirror since I’d arrived. It was such a weird thought—random, intrusive—but it lodged itself in my head. I wandered down the hallway to the bathroom and flicked on the light.

At first, I didn’t notice anything unusual. Just my reflection staring back at me: hollow cheeks, bags under my eyes, and stubble I hadn’t bothered to shave. But as I turned to leave, something made me stop.

My reflection wasn’t moving.

I froze, my hand still on the doorframe. My reflection just… stood there, staring at me, its head tilted slightly to the side like it was studying me. The longer I looked, the more wrong it felt. Its eyes seemed a little too wide, the corners of its mouth twitching ever so slightly.

I blinked.

So did it.

And suddenly, it was normal again.

I stumbled back into the hallway, my heart pounding. I told myself it was just a trick of the light, that I was tired, that maybe grief was finally messing with my head.

I didn’t go back to the bathroom that night.

The next few days, things got worse.

I started avoiding mirrors entirely. I didn’t even know why—just that every time I passed by one, I felt like something was *watching me*. That same weird, crawling sensation at the back of my neck.

But mirrors have a way of sneaking up on you. The window over the kitchen sink reflected just enough to catch a glimpse of myself when I washed my hands. The black screen of my phone, lying face up on the coffee table, would flash my face when I reached for it. And every time, I thought I saw something move—a flicker of motion that didn’t quite match mine.

It wasn’t until the fifth night that I realized I wasn’t imagining things.

I was brushing my teeth in the bathroom, trying to keep my eyes on the sink instead of the mirror. But as I turned off the faucet, I heard it—a soft *tapping*. Like fingernails, tapping against glass.

I froze.

The sound wasn’t coming from the window. It was coming from the mirror.

I looked up, and my stomach dropped.

My reflection was smiling.

Not a normal smile. It was too wide, its teeth bared in a way that didn’t match my face at all. Its head twitched, just slightly, and its eyes locked onto mine.

Then, it raised its hand—and waved.

I screamed and stumbled backward, knocking over the trash can. By the time I dared to look again, the reflection was normal. It was just me.

But I knew what I’d seen.

Last night, the thing in the mirror stopped pretending.

I woke up around 3 a.m. to the sound of glass shattering. It took me a moment to realize it was coming from the bathroom. My first thought was that a tree branch had broken the window, but when I opened the door, the window was fine.

The mirror, however, was cracked right down the middle.

My reflection stood in the shards, fractured and wrong. It didn’t move as I stared at it, its face split into jagged fragments. But then, one of the shards shifted—*it moved*, as if something was crawling behind the glass.

I backed out of the bathroom, slamming the door behind me, and grabbed my keys. I didn’t care if it was the middle of the night—I was leaving.

But as I ran to the front door, I stopped cold.

The living room window was reflecting me. So was the TV. So was the glossy surface of the picture frame on the wall. Everywhere I turned, I saw myself staring back. And in every single reflection, *I wasn’t alone.*

There was something standing behind me.

I’ve barricaded myself in the bedroom now, but it doesn’t matter. The bedroom mirror is on the closet door, and I can hear it tapping.

It’s been tapping for hours.

I don’t know what it wants, but I’m too afraid to look. If anyone reads this, don’t go near mirrors. Don’t let them see you. Because once they do, they won’t stop.

And if you ever see something move behind you…

Don’t turn around.

I looked.

God help me, I looked.

I thought about you all day today. They stole what you gave me. I know who did it. I had it for a year until I grabbed it from my bag so I know I’m being watched. They stole it the next day. 

I washed my hair last night. Do you remember going to the festival and seeing the clowns? I still remember seeing the one with shampoo all over their wig. It was so funny.

1hnvfj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweatystartup/comments/1hnvfj6/what_i_learned_in_pricing_my_jobs_and_my_hope_it/,What I Learned in Pricing My Jobs and My Hope it Can Help People Starting Out,"Occasionally, I'll see newer startups asking ""how much should I charge for x"" type questions It's a legitimate question. I am glad you’re asking.

But, I think you need to understand that for those of us with experience, the answer isn't easy for us to give. Why? Well, there are variables only you know... or maybe even haven't figured out yet.

Yes! It’s a legitimate concern and a question to pose because pricing can make or break your business. Charge too little, and yes, you might win the job—but you’ll work tirelessly just to scrape by. Charge too much, and you might scare potential customers away. The goal for you is to find that sweet spot where your pricing reflects the value of your work, allows you to grow, and, most importantly, sustains your business.

But, we can’t answer this accurately for you. Not unless you have figured out some basic information that, honestly, you should always be mindful of. What does it cost you to operate?

I want to say this again, folks, because it is something I didn’t do when I first started out and it cost me. Before you can even think about setting your prices, you need to know what it costs YOU to operate (not me, not anyone else here. Your costs will be different than anyone else’s). This is true whether you’re a solo operator or you’re managing a team.

So, I want to take just a little time and run through how you can figure this out. I write this from the perspective of a landscaping and hardscaping business because that's my experience. But it applies to many home service businesses because we face many of the same expenses and challenges. 

Let’s start with a few definitions. Here’s where we break it down:

Fixed      expenses: These are costs you incur no matter how much work you do.      Think of things like your truck payment, insurance, software      subscriptions, and any tools or equipment you own that need maintenance.      Rent for a shop. Phones. Website…you should have the picture

Variable      expenses: These are costs that depend on how much work you’re doing.      For example, fuel, materials for jobs, or extra labor you bring on for      specific projects.

Even if you're just starting out and working by yourself, these expenses exist, and you need to account for them.

I do everything which is a fixed cost as a monthly calculation, so, even if your insurance is one lump payment at the beginning of the year, divide that by 12 and get your monthly cost. If you have a salaried team member and pay them weekly, or even yourself, that too is a fixed cost. But, since you pay them weekly, take that weekly salary and multiply it by 4.33 (there are 52 weeks in a year, 12 months in a year which comes to the most accurate way to express this, 4.33).

Once you have your fixed expenses covered you will have calculated your overhead.

I will give a super simple example because putting it in a post would be confusing if I got too far in the details. Let’s say you have insurance (truck and liability insurance) of $400/month, and you pay yourself $3,000/month and your website is $50/month and your phone is another $100/month….boy, you’re running lean. Great Job! LOL…..Your monthly overhead is $3550.00/month.

That is what you need to cover, plus any variable expenses just to break even. But you also want to make a profit. So, you need to set a margin for that.

Before we get there, though, let’s talk about production hours. I am sure you have already realized that you may start working at 7 and finish at 6 in the evening or later. That’s 11 hours at work. But, not all of those hours are actually production hours. You have loading and unloading time, maybe stopping for gas and supplies and those infernal energy drinks everyone’s chugging (honestly guys, what the hell is wrong with good old coffee???), drive time….all these things are considered non production.

 When you are making money, whether it’s cutting a lawn or removing landscape that is production hours.

How many hours a day are you actually producing? You need to know that. It should be something you are always tracking and fine tuning. You want to be out the door and earning as quickly as possible (and you should be fine tuning this all the time). So, let’s say on an 11 hour day you are spending 9 of them producing, because you’re a hard charger, right?

OK…some math again. You work 5 days a week, producing 9 hours each day. That means you are producing 45 hours of the week. We already discussed how a month is 4.33 weeks so we take our 45 hours, multiply it by 4.33 and we come up with 194.85 production hours a month. Let’s call it 195.

Take your overhead of $3550 and divide by 195 and your hourly overhead cost is $18.20.
So, when you are looking at a job, before you even figure out what to charge you know that you have to charge at least $18.20/hour just to break even. Now, you add in your variable costs. How much will gas cost? Any labor you use (and this is an entirely different post because there are a lot of hidden costs in labor that need to be considered like your portion of taxes, unemployment, work comp, benefits, if you give vacation to them paid then they need to earn that amount also during their working time….), materials, dump fees, blade replacements, breakage etc.

You want to add all that in as well and calculate. So, I will make this simple. You have a job you think will take three hours. You are going to have a laborer help you at the rate of $22/hour. You will use $3.00 in gas and dump fees of $80.00 plus an hour to and at the dump.

That’s 4 hours labor at $22.00 for $88.00 in labor, $80.00 dump fee and $3.00 gas.

Total? $171.00 in variable costs.

Divide that by estimated hours to complete which is $171.00/4 giving you a variable rate of $42.75/hour.

Add your hourly fixed costs to this $42.75+$18.20 and you get a base rate of $60.95/hour.

We aren’t done. You need a profit. You need to determine what rate you want. Here, we will say 30%. Take your $60.95 and divide by 0.7 (1-0.3 is how that’s determined) and you get a rate of $87.07/hour.

So, for this theoretical job you want to charge $87.07 times the estimated hours of 4 and you get $348.28…I would round up to $349.00

Now that you know your hourly rate, let’s talk about something equally important: your minimum charge. This is the amount you charge just to show up for a job, regardless of how small it is. Why? Because even if a job only takes 20 minutes, you’ve still spent time driving there, loading up your truck, and prepping.

For example, if your base hourly rate is $60, you wouldn’t charge $20 for a 20-minute job—you’d lose money. Instead, set a minimum charge that ensures your time and effort are covered, even for small jobs. This might be $100, $150, or whatever makes sense based on your calculations.

Pricing isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer. It takes work to figure out your numbers, but once you do, you’ll have confidence in your pricing and peace of mind knowing you’re not leaving money on the table—or working yourself into the ground for too little.

If you need further help with this, just ask! I have tried to explain this as simply as I can in a post. It always seems easier when I would sit down with my team and explain this in the conference area!

I do have a spreadsheet you can use to plug in your numbers and figure out your rates—it’ll make the process much easier. If you think that’ll help you just reach out and I will share it with you.

I've nearly always been over weight expect for a short (4 years) in college when I didn't have a healthy relationship with food. At that time I was actually the size your ""supposed"" to be according to BMI. Since then I have repaired my relationship with food (yay!) And I mostly cook for myself at home. I've done everything obvious that I can think of to reduce calories. Ie: fat free cheese, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, mostly drink water, once every 6-8 months I'll have a sprite, black coffee, lean meats, lots of fiber through veggies and fruits, replacing desserts with fruit, regular bread with keto bread, egg whites replace most egg consumption. I meal prep. I work out 3-4 times a week for an hour. 1 session is with a personal trainer and the other 2-3 times is a crossfit class. I can deadlift 265lbs, front squat 175 lbs, back squat 200lbs, bench 165lbs. I work a fairly active job, carrying mail at the post office. And I just don't lose any damn weight. Tracking macros or calories isn't an option for me long term cause that's what caused my bad relationship with food in the first place. What else can I do? I think I eat fairly well, I have an active job, I exercise, I get enough sleep, and I don't have any known health concerns (just got a physical within the last year -everything is normal) 

As a reference a typical day goes as such: wake up at 4:30, go to the gym at 5:15-6:15, come home eat breakfast (today was a breakfast burrito-which has 2 eggs, carb smart tortilla, 1 oz of bacon cut into small peices, 1 oz cheese and 2 oz of green/red pepper) go to work (9,800 steps from work alone), lunch (was a protien shake, apple, 4 oz deli turkey), go home (dinner was 4 street sized corn tortilla tacos with homade carintas, verde, white onion and cilantro.) Usually in bed and asleep by 8:30-9pm. 

At what point do I give up? At what point do I consider something like bariatric surgery or weight loss medications? Would that even help? I feel so stuck in this journey I don't know what else to do. Reddit tell me what I'm doing wrong!!",1,1735352115.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

I’m looking for a bromance like everyone here. 
I’ve honestly not had much luck with friends whether they move or get married or we lose touch. I really like to chat and have a conversation and have fun and see where things go. Would be amazing if you were close to where I live to be able to one day meet up. I’m in Georgia, USA if you were wondering. 

I’m a nice and chill guy who enjoys simple things. A good movie, a good tv show, a nice cup of coffee, good food, sitcoms ( the office, parks and rec, superstore, modern family), drawing, reading, and baking. I unfortunately don’t game. Enjoy hiking and traveling when I can. An ideal bro would be someone very similar to me who enjoys talking, we could go to another app and send pics and vids and even video call. I would consider myself bi curious but never been with a guy. Open to nudity for sure it’s all good it’s guys being guys and doing guy things. I’m Hispanic too and that’s something. Looking for sorta athletic guy who would help me keep a workout going and we can encourage each other.

I am Jake, a budding entrepreneur screaming out for a door to open, that provides me with the resources I need to build, launch and scale a huge and constantly growing portfolio of novel business ideas, physical products, SAAS products and digital offerings.

To you I am nobody, but I have collected quite a few humbling achievements, and have a burning desire to both disrupt industries and share my ideas with others who can help me in doing so.

Further on in this email, I will share with you businesses I have already built, launched and scaled myself, my background, experience and story. *Please know, this is not a generic post. I wrote this post myself, and I implore you to keep reading, if for no other reason than out of curiosity.*

**Tl;dr** \- I am Jake, proud recipient of “Young Trade Entrepreneur Of The Year 2023”. I am a 24/7 innovator, problem solver, learning obsessed individual with an ever growing portfolio of proudly novel ideas and products. Ideas that I want to share with someone who is willing to jump onboard, ideas that I am not sentimental too and that I 100% believe can make both a difference in the world and industry and disrupt markets.

I am seeking an opportunity to meet someone, who may be interested in giving a passionate entrepreneur like myself a chance to prove I can walk the walk as well as I talk the talk.

I could write for pages and pages here, but I am not here to waste your time. Right now, I am just trying to find someone with an open mind, who may (or may not be) looking for someone new and exciting, innovative and passionate to invest in.

 I just want to put myself and my story in front of you, and see if there is an opportunity for us to connect, chew the fat, and hopefully start the beginning of a relationship.

I do not want to pitch you. I could, but I prefer to talk and explain what I am all about. 

**To give a little context about me.**

* I have a construction background, but am highly educated and passionate about many other industries and areas, like AI, IT, Management, marketing and others.
* I started my landscaping business in 2020. Grew it to 500k revenue in 3 years, starting with $0. Built my website myself, grew to the top of Google organically, and had a lead generating machine with $0 spend.
* **Started a side business, relating to retail, buying & selling, with profit margins of 5,000% - 10,000% (yes, they are they correct numbers, which I can provide proof of if you’d like)**
* I have a 50+ page booklet of some of my ideas, business plans, and products, most of which are now outdated as I have many more.
* The last 6 months I have been generating multiple new business ideas and models, with researched business plans and value propositions, all which I believe I could scale to $1+ million in 12 months with the right resources.
* Have designed 5+ novel physical products, relating to the construction industry. Truly disruptive products, which I have acquired industry feedback (under NDA’s) to the likes of “Why hasn’t anybody done that? You’ll retire!” Currently I have a metal fabricator who is obsessed with them and wants to build a company.
* Have a list of 5-10 SAAS products, which grows every other day. 
* I have written and launched a 40 page eBook titled “How To Build A Profitable Service Based Business For Less Than 1k”.
* I had goals to write and release a newsletter around my ideas, my methodology around innovation, which I am 30 pages into.
* Reached out to a VC firm here and ended up catching up with a board member every week for coffee, who had some surprisingly nice things to say about me.

By now you may have the impression that I am an absolute unit and I don’t want to keep rambling too long. But the truth is, my mind just does not stop. And I hope I have managed to convey enough to establish a bit of an about me. 

I have always been completely obsessed with learning. Learning everything and anything. Any subject, any industry. I love to know how things work, why things are the way they are.

And right now, I do not have the resources or network to get most of my ideas off of the ground and so I am looking for a mentor, a potential investor, not just in my ideas, but in me. I have so much I want to share with the right person, so much value I want to add and I do not care for greediness.

**What's In It For You?**

***I would rather own 10% of a company built around an idea I created, over taking my ideas to the grave with me.***

I care not for sole or majority ownership of anything I currently build or create. I have so many ideas, I'd love to just be able to focus on one at a time, and release a long line of products, different industries, different setups.

With any luck, an investor would own the other 90%. Anyway, I will leave it at that for now. 

*Put simply, at this point I am reaching out for the opportunity to start a conversation and have a chat, nothing more.*   
You may want me to prove I'm worth my salt, in which case I would implore you to give me a task, a challenge, maybe to come up with an innovative solution to a problem. Any industry.

Anyway, thanks for coming to my TedTalk. Look forward to hearing from any interested parties!",1,1735351996.0,EntrepreneurConnect,0,1.0,False

1hnvcax,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hnvcax,Cozier vibes??,"Hi! Bear with me and this long string of trying to explain where I’m at with this right now, I recently got rid of my couch and replaced it with this one (secondhand for a really good price, my old one was basically falling apart) and had to kind of move things around so it would fit. The large bookshelf used to be where the small one is now, which is why those two hanging photos seem so off center (those and the rest of what’s hanging will be moved once I get everything else where I want it, the cubes on that ledge can also hang) The TV was originally in the corner where the vines are on the wall, those will also be coming down. 
As of right now, once I take down my Christmas tree and other decorations, my plan is to move the TV into the corner where the tree is now, then move the large bookshelf back to where the small one is now, and the red chair will end up where the TV is now. I’m not sure if that makes sense, but I just want it to look coherent and cozy and I’m open to any ideas. I also wanna lose the 3 circles with the monstera leaves and maybe replace them with something else. I have to keep the couch, chair, and large bookshelf but I wouldn’t mind different coffee/end tables that would look better, the rug is also not in great condition. I’d also like to get a TV stand that is proportioned better than my current one

I (m32) want to cut out my father (m56) once and for all. I have hated the man all my life. The court system for some reason gave him custody of me when my parents split when I was 10 months old. Growing up he hit me a lot and demeaned me constantly. Sometimes publicly and other times privately. He was huge into the gym so much so he competed in bodybuilding. So to protect myself I began going to the gym at 11 years old and joined the school wrestling team. By the time I was 13 I could shoulder press 215 and bench 315. I could finally protect myself from him. For some more context, he is very wealthy. He makes roughly 500k a year and has a net worth of 5 million. I do very well and couldn’t give two shits that I’m his only heir.
I remember when my mother deployed to Iraq the first time and he said I wouldn’t see my step father who I love very much. I remember when I asked if we could get a second dog and he smashed his coffee cup in the driveway and unloaded on me because he didn’t have time “for fucking anything”. I remember when he beat me for not liking his friends kid. I remember the loads of women and girlfriends he brought me around and moved into our home. I can name most of them but in my lifetime he has introduced me to 12 of them. Most lasting 6 months to 3 years.  I resent him for controlling me constantly. If I played a sport I was always the last one to be picked up. Often times I would wait 30-60 minutes past the end of a practice to be picked up. When I was 19 I found out I was going to be a father. I was stationed 3 hours away from him and quit talking to him. One day he randomly showed up on my door step and said he wanted to be in my life especially since he was going to be a grandfather. I have regretted ever letting him back in my life ever since.  
Now onto present day. A year ago I met his 12th girlfriend and she was a nutjob. To put it short she completely fucked up an evening. Eventually she ended up hitting my father and making out with another guy at a bar while they were on vacation. He is now onto the next girlfriend. He has asked several times for me to meet her and I told him I had no interest. I said I did not want to meet her as their relationship wouldn’t last. He just will not take no for an answer. He has moved her in to his house already as well. I have no desire for my daughter to get attached to her either as she did the 10th girlfriend. He is saying that I’m being unsupportive and that it’s a big fuck you to him. I want him out of my life permanently and do not know how to do it without becoming very angry. His lack of caring about what I want and how he treated me as a child makes my blood boil. How do you get someone to leave you alone when you’re their only kid?

As always, my routine couldn’t begin without a stop at **Starbucks**—it’s like my personal ritual to kick-start the day. ☕

At work, preparations for our **New Year party** were in full swing. It was fun spending time brainstorming and getting things ready for the celebration—it’s always nice to end the year on a festive note! 

Later in the day, a **friend dropped by** at home, and we spent some quality time catching up. It’s moments like these that remind me how much I value good connections and simple conversations.

Yet, through it all, there’s this lingering **thought in the back of my mind**—what it is, I’m not entirely sure. Maybe it’s just one of those days when the brain feels a bit restless. Oh, and the **eye irritation** made another appearance—why does inflammation seem to pop up at the most random times? 

But hey, every day has its quirks, right? With that, it’s time to **call it a day** and look forward to whatever tomorrow holds.

So recently, I had a sense that I’d “see” my ex-best friend again. And I did. Twice. I bumped into my her once near our offices just because both of us were grabbing a cup of coffee and I saw her again in another mutual friend’s stories

And I can’t explain the complicated mix of emotions I feel when I saw her - I was happy but also angry and sad, and because it’s been 5 months, which I thought was quite long, I felt numb afterwards 

The interim period was me trying to let go - by going for therapy, limiting contact (left mutual groups and removed her number). For context, she blocked me at a time when we were going through our lowest points

All I did was write a sincere letter to take accountability for my part of the conflict and pass it to that specific mutual friend (along with a small gift) so that she could help to pass to her.

Does anyone have this experience before? How did you navigate the complex feelings?

I found my most recent AP 6 months ago on onlyfans - broke many rules I had for myself and met him somewhere neutral for coffee and we had some very immediate chemistry. I don’t see things ending anytime soon and we have a pretty accommodating schedule where we see each other every week or two even if it’s just to hangout for an hour.

He’s kind, thoughtful, attentive, etc. having him has completely changed my life. His positive outlook, vibrancy and just overall personality are so refreshing to me I can’t get enough.

I’m 34f and have been with my husband (37m) for almost 15 years. We’ve been living together for 10 and married for 6. I knew what I was buying when I bought it.

He’s had anger issues since we met and they have gotten increasingly worse since I became pregnant almost 4 years ago. Our daughter is now 3-and-a-bit and the light of my life. 

More recently she’s started to pickup on his cues and ask him to be nicer to me or not yell. Twice this month he’s hit me hard enough to leave a bruise and he did the last one while I was holding her.

My AP has started asking why I have some bruises in places that couldn’t be explained and having a toddler is a pretty good cover up - those of you that have one know their elbows are crazy and extremely painful lol

I know this is a situation I should be planning an exit for. I need to come to terms to what this means for access to my child. He’s otherwise a great parent and I would want them to have a strong relationship but that means I would no longer get her 24/7.

Will confiding in my AP make him run for the hills? I don’t want him to carry this burden that I’m facing more than a dead bedroom or think I’m considering separation because of him.

If you do enough digging through my gumroad profile or searching ""young trade entrepreneur of the year 2023"" you can find me for proof...  
  
I have written an introductory guide into how I generate million-dollar ideas.  
  
I'll include a link in the comments.  
  
It is the cost of a cup of coffee - I plan to release a LOT more, with in depth business plans for the ideas I release, mind maps, forecasting, scaling strategies, exit strategies, comprehensive pitch deck builds and 1-to-1 consulting.  
  
Obviously the ""million"" is subject to the execution. But for transparency, I have included one of my own ideas, that anyone is free to use. It is novel, and has not been built before. It is an SAAS idea.  

It explains how I came up with the idea and some key value propositions, the problem it solves and some features.

I will be writing up an in depth business plan, SWOT analysis and forecast for that idea too. Anybody is free to use / build it if they like.
  
I have heaps and heaps more, that I plan to release in the future. I do not have the time to build them myself, but I generate them on a daily basis. Truly innovative ideas, some with massive TAM or Total Addressable Markets.  
  
If you want some context into why I use the term ""Million Dollar"" - head to the platform builder ""ShareTribe"" and read their customer success stories - founders who raised millions for their ideas, and some of mine I deem to be a lot more disruptful.

I am currently a junior transfer student at a decent University (non-target). I really want to get into Private Banking or wealth management or financial advisory.

I know I am late to the game but I dropped the ball with 2025 internships, I want to still get one but I am now also aiming for 2026 now as my important internship. I am thinking of delaying a semester to get this to work.

I plan on cold emailing or calling all local RIA firms in my area for networking purposes in order to land an internship for either 2026 or optimistically 2025.

My question is how do I approach this in terms of who to connect with? I've networked for IB but not for wealth management firms.

Should I just google their teams and cold email 2 people high up at that firm? Or target people with a lower position but maybe have more in common like alumni.
Should I just straight up email Financial Advisors and send my resume+ ask for a coffee chat to learn about their experience or straight up ask if they would accept an intern?

As time has gone on, more and more adverts keep popping up with Stake branding, celebrity/influencer endorsements etc. Coffee even used a screenshot of Stake showcasing it in the CSGO videos.

I did a little digging and it turns out that they obtained their gambling license from Curacao and not Malta, which is allegedly the gold standard for licensing, and recently, the regulators have been in a little bit of trouble.

There are plenty of alcoholic drinks that are served hot. Here are some: 

-Hot Toddy: A classic winter drink made with hot water, whiskey, a sweetener like sugar or honey, and cinnamon or star anise
-Irish Coffee: A traditional hot alcoholic drink
-Hot Buttered Rum: A hot alcoholic drink

Now yes coffee and tea are served hot or warm.. but no where does it specify other than in verse 9. Could it be it's referring to things more like above and not coffee or tea? 

I'm I way out there on this one? Looking for some guidance here. 

Edit- adding more info and pointing another thing out that makes me question... 

So if you look up word of wisdom on the gospel library app you are directed here:

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/word-of-wisdom?lang=eng

The opening reads ""God has revealed the Word of Wisdom as a commandment for the physical and spiritual benefit of His children.""

So the manual says it's a commandment but in D&C 89 it says this:

1 A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion— 

2 To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days

(January 2025)","Hello friends I hope you had a happy holidays. Today I wanted to give you guys a full breakdown on one of my favorite nootropics I have used that one being 9-ME-BC. 

As always if you are looking for a reputable source of 9-ME-BC you can find tons of great sourcing [options here. ](https://biohackingu.com/sources/)Wether you are in the EU or in America we have a quality source for you :). Now lets dive into it. 

# What Is 9-ME-BC?

9-Methyl-β-Carboline (9-Me-BC) is a nootropic compound belonging to the β-carboline family. It is known for its potential neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties, primarily studied for its effects on dopamine signaling and cognitive enhancement. Unlike stimulants, which provide short-term boosts, 9-Me-BC works at a deeper level, promoting long-term brain health and function.



# How Does It Work In the Body?

9-ME-BC functions in the body through a few different ways. 

1. It helps to restore and protect dopaminergic neurons. It has been show to help stimulate the growth of these dopaminergic neurons.

2. Inhibits Monoamine Oxidate Activity

3. Stimulates Expression of Neurotrophic Factors by Astrocyte

4. Elevates dopamine levels in the hippocampus

5. Increases Dendritic and Synaptic Proliferation

6. Reduces inflammation

# Benefits

Now here is where things get interesting is in the benefits of 9-ME-BC. If you ever found yourself in a situation where situations that usually give you a good boost in happiness or excitement now do not like that morning cup of coffee or your preworkout does not hit the same anymore  9-ME-BC can become a perfect solution. 

It is also great at providing the user with motivation to get stuff done. 

The dopamine system is strongly tied into motivation and often times our hyper dopaminergic world leads us to have sub optimal dopamine levels. Which means we lose some of that child look wonder that we used to have. 

Of course when using this I have also noticed that I had much better focus and motivation as well. 

Typically I think this is best after you have noticed a stimulant tolerance beginning to form.

# Side Effects

When it comes to side effects here are a few notable ones.

\- Sensitivity to sunlight 

\- Unknown long term side effects

\- Beta Carbolines are known to be neurotoxic. While it seems of course that 9-ME-BC has the opposite effect it is important to note that we still do not know the long term side effects of this compound. 

\- Overstimulation: while rare some clients I have worked with have gotten overstimulated from this compound leading to them becoming a bit erratic. 

# Dosing

Now I make sure to always limit my exposure to this compound. I typically do 2-3 3-4 week courses of it per year to correct any stimulant tolerance that I have developed. 

For example here is a sample dosing protocol.

I have school finals for my college and I am using alot of modafinil and caffeine.  

The week after I will then use 9-ME-BC at 15mg per day sublingual for the first two weeks. 

Then on the final week or two I will raise it to 30mg. During this time I keep stimulants as low as possible, and am very mindful of sun exposure. 

Then after this protocol when I go back to my normal stimulant programming I become hyper sensitive to stimulants which is awesome. 

# My Experience

Now what I love about 9-ME-BC for myself is that it brings back that kind of child like/teenage excitement you used to have. As you get older the world gets more dull in a sense and I think that 9-ME-BC is great for getting you fired back up and motivated again. 

I also notice that when I use this my brain tends to work alot better when I am on this. 

I hope this was helpful please let me know if you guys have any questions below :)

This lasted for months. Thankfully, since I was working a physically demanding job for 16+ hours a day, I didnt gain much fat.

I kicked that habit, thankfully. I now eat someehat normally but still cant resist the sweets. I drink zero sugar drink, I use artificial sweeteners in my coffee, but whenever I pass a supermarket, I have to go in and buy a chocolate. And when I get home, instead of taking 2 squares and leaving it alone, I cant rest until I fully demolish it, knowing its sitting there waiting for me.

I gained 9 kilos over the past 6 months. There is noe noticable fat, even though I work out. Even at my new workplace, where I work 6 hours a day, there is no other food other than a sweets machine, which I indulge in since I have nothing else to eat, and as I sad, I cant cook for shit so no meal prepping.

Vell woke up in an apartment that still needed unpacking. They’d put together the bed and not much else last night.

“Mornin’, hero,” Skye mumbled.

“Mornin’, also hero,” Vell said back. “You want some coffee?”

“I want the sheets,” Skye said. She rolled over and bundled the blankets around herself. “Boat doesn’t set out for another two hours. I’m sleeping in.”

While Harlan Industries had no Marine Biology department (and no interesting in acquiring one), there was a local outpost for Protected Species Observation, in charge of monitoring populations of endangered sea creatures along the coast. It involved a little less genetic engineering than Skye would like, but protecting endangered species was still nice.

Vell gave Skye a kiss on the cheek, and she deigned to poke her head out of the comfort of the sheets long enough to return it. He set himself to a morning routine that was made slightly difficult by the fact that his toothpaste, clothes, and briefcase were all in different boxes. All uphill from today, though. He grabbed a quick breakfast on the way out and headed into the world with a briefcase in one hand and a box of his office supplies in the other, all entirely without incident.

In an equally undramatic progression of events, Vell had to take the bus. Buying a car was another thing on their “do later” list. He found a seat and waited as the bus headed to the next stop. Another batch of riders got on, and one took a seat next to Vell, riding next to him in silence for a while before recognition washed over her face.

“Hey, aren’t you that guy who did the science stuff on that island?”

Vell turned to his neighbor, pursed his lips, and examined her for a few seconds.

“Yes, I am,” Vell said. “But you already know that, don’t you Quenay?”

The middle-aged woman chuckled and turned forward.

“Should’ve figured.”

“Still got those eyes,” Vell said. Try as she might, Quenay had a tell. Even without her vibrant color scheme or her old black-and-white disguise, Quenay always had slightly mismatched colors in her irises.

“Y’know, most people never notice that kind of thing,” Quenay said. “You’re the weird one.”

No one around them seemed to acknowledge their conversation. Quenay was, perhaps, using her old trick to make sure no one else could heart their conversation, but Vell didn’t entirely count on it. He’d been burned by that before.

“Yes, I am,” Vell said. “So why are you here?”

“Because you lied to me, Vell,” Quenay said. “I asked if you had any more questions, and you said no. But you do.”

“Okay, maybe I do,” Vell said. He wouldn’t bother with the same lie twice. He just hadn’t wanted to drag out the spectacle at the time. “Two questions.”

“Let me have ‘em,” Quenay said.

“First question,” Vell said. “What happens to you now? People know about you, they might pray to you. Are you going to fade out like the other gods?”

“Hah! I’ve been at it for a few thousand years, Vell, going to take more than this to take me out,” Quenay laughed. “You people don’t even know my real name. Good luck trying to pray to something you don’t understand.”

Quenay chuckled at the very idea that she could be taken out that easily.

“But...there might be some changes,” Quenay said. “Might not be as strong as I once was. Probably going to get caught a little more often. But who cares, yeah? Chaos needs to change every once in a while, or it’s not chaos. Just a messy order. Change of pace will do me good.”

She crossed her legs and put on a confident smile.

“Satisfied?”

“Mostly,” Vell said. “So, second question.”

He clutched the box of supplies in his lap and stared out the window for a second.

“Why me?” Vell asked. “You had a whole world of people you could’ve chosen. There were hundreds of other people on that train alone. Why me, and not...anyone else?”

“Well, that’s complicated...You remember giving candy to a stranger before you got on the train?”

“Yeah, I- wait, was that you?”

“No, completely unrelated,” Quenay said. “But I did see you do it.”

**A LONG TIME AGO**

Quenay hovered in the air above the crowds milling through the train station. There were hundreds of them. Businessmen, tourists, families, people of all kinds. Quenay crossed her legs and glared at them all with frustration. That train was going to crash. They were all going to die.

Quenay hated death. Not capital-D Death, the reaper was quite nice. They got along very well. And she wasn’t just thinking about that because he was right next to her.

“You’re early,” Quenay said.

**I enjoy talking with you**, Death said. **Especially when I feel you are about to do something interesting.**

“Is interesting your polite way of saying stupid?”

**If I thought you were going to do something stupid, I would say so**, Death said. **What would you do about it? Kill me?**

“Har har,” Quenay said. “You’re the death expert. How do you stop train crashes?”

**By not building trains**, Death said. **You have seen what is to come. A freak accident, tragic and unavoidable. This universe was not built to create or sustain complex mechanisms: that they occur at all and work as well as they do is a testament to the willpower of mortal beings. But even they can only do so much. As can you.**

Quenay scowled at the universe. She and Death were, technically, at constant war with one another. Chaos was the seedbed of life, the source of the entirely accidental reactions that had turned ancient chemicals into odd acids into the first proteins and eventually complex beings capable of reproducing, of making music, of building bullet trains. But that chain of happy accidents could only sustain itself for so long. Eventually, everything succumbed to that original order of entropy. Everything decayed, everything fell apart, and everything died. Quenay just wanted to delay it as long as possible and whenever possible

“This isn’t one of the ones I can win, is it?”

**I am afraid not**, Death said. **I am sorry.**

Quenay could only act within the rules of her divine station, and the problem with chaos was that chaos plus chaos usually just accelerated the chaos, and the endpoint of chaos was always the absolute order of Death. As much as she wanted to sustain life, her direct intervention often ended up making things worse.

**Attempts to defy entropy rarely ends well**, Death said. **Only The Island has had any success, and I doubt you wish to recreate that.**

“No thank you,” Quenay said. “I’m not quite as selfless as those two.”

She liked life, but she also enjoyed her own freedom too much to make that kind of eternity-long commitment. She drifted down to just above the heads of the train passengers, and watched them scurry about their blissfully ignorant lives, soon to be cut short.

**You know**, Death said. **You cannot prevent this tragedy. But you can save at least one.**

“How?”

**You know how. Certain privileges are afforded to a Champion.**

Quenay rolled over and stared up at Death.

“I don’t do that anymore,” she snapped. Even Gods could not hand out miracles on a whim. They had to be earned, won by a Champion in a divine Challenge. Gods of other domains had a little leeway in their Challenges, but for Quenay, who had lived millenia in secrecy, there was only one challenge: the challenge to discern her true nature. Quenay had been all to happy to run that trial, for a time. Her “games” had been fun at first, and a chance to give humanity the power to help themselves, but she had suffered too many devastating losses. Atlantis had been bad enough, but Tunguska had soured her on the concept altogether. She didn’t want to be the cause of any more destruction.

**Perhaps you should be more discriminating in your choice of Champion.**

“I’ve tried everything, D,” Quenay complained. “Smart, strong, rich, well-connected. They always come up short.”

**Perhaps therein lies the problem**, Death said. **You go looking for greatness, in hopes it will match the challenge you lay out before them.**

Death stopped to watch a pair of young lovers stroll by, blissfully ignorant of the fate that awaited them.

**Humanity’s beauty lies not in what they are, but in what they can be**, Death said. **They envy the power of beings like you and I, unaware that we are defined by our stations, chained to the very same laws that grant us power. They have no inherent power, and yet no inherent limitations. They can be anything.**

Death ceased his observations and turned his attention back to Quenay.

**Which is all to say that perhaps you should stop expecting to find a Champion lying around, and start looking for the one who could be a Champion.**

“Are you suggesting I take a shot in the dark and hope some rando turns out to be able to solve the universe’s biggest mystery?”

**Not random. You can take an educated guess, if you like**, Death said. **But you cannot expect to teach a lesson in hope if you are unwilling to do some hoping yourself.**

“Fine. I’ll think about it.,” Quenay grunted.

**Think fast**, Death said. **On a related note, you must excuse me. I am about to be very busy.**

Death tipped his scythe in Quenay’s direction and vanished. The reminder of his purpose set Quenay back to hers. It was only one life. But with the right choice, it could be worth a lot more. She darted among the dozens of passengers, the rich, the poor, the wise, the foolish, those alone and those among friends and family. Humans had disappointed her so many times before she wasn’t sure who could possibly the next champion.

She darted over a hundred people or more, until her drifting flight took her past a bench where a mother and child sat next to a stranger who was clearly anxious about taking the train. The little boy quietly asked his nervous-looking neighbor if she would like some candy, and happily shared it when she said yes.

Quenay smiled, and set her mismatched eyes on a young Vell Harlan.

“Alright. Maybe one more time.”

\*\*\*

“That’s it? One nice thing?”

“Were you listening, Harlan?” Quenay said. “I didn’t pick you because you were great. I picked you because you had the ability to become great.”

She gave Vell a quick pat on the back, and an electric spark travelled between her fingertips and the rune inscribed on Vell’s spine.

“I’d bet on a lot of people for a lot of reasons, Vell,” Quenay said. “The smart, the strong, the rich, all sorts of people.”

Quenay looked at Vell Harlan, all grown up, and smiled the same smile she had so many years ago.

“You were the first time I bet on kindness,” Quenay said. “I gave you the chance to do good, and you took it. Only thing I did was give you a respawn and a fancy tramp stamp. That other world-saving nonsense was all you.”

The bus came to a halt. Quenay gave Vell a kiss on the cheek and stood up.

“This is my stop,” Quenay said. Vell narrowed his eyes and stared up at the departing Goddess.

“Am I ever going to see you again?”

“Ah, you said you only had two more questions,” Quenay said, wagging a scolding finger at Vell. She winked at Vell once and stepped off the bus, vanishing around a corner not long after she did so. Vell shrugged, and turned his eyes ahead. His stop was next.

Vell grabbed his things and stepped off the bus alongside a surprising number of other people. The parking lot of Harlan Industries was packed, and there was actually a line out the door, presumably people waiting (or just hoping) for appointments or job interviews. A few people tried to get Vell’s attention as he walked in, but he used his expertly practiced skedaddle to move right on by.

Freed from the attention of the crowd, Vell stepped inside and shut the door behind him. He walked through a crowded lobby, waved hi to the receptionist (it felt weird that he had a receptionist) and up the stars. He’d never been in this building before, but thanks to multiple calls with Vell and Harley, he knew the building by heart. He kept moving up, then found his hall, past the production floor and the break room, to the executive suite. Two office doors burst open at once as he made his approach.

“Vell!”

Lee and Harley grabbed him in a hug considerably complicated by his briefcase and box of supplies. Thankfully it was short.

“Thank god you’re here,” Lee said. “Freddy and the new hires are setting up the research lab and they could use a bit of organization. After you take a minute to get settled, could you-”

“I’ll get right on it,” Vell said.

“Oh, thank you,” Lee said. “I’ll help you get things started, and then-”

“Lee! Our granite supplier’s on the phone, they need to talk with you!”

“Oh damn it, I’ll be along in a moment,” Lee said. “One second!”

“We still have some boxes in your offices, we meant to get them unpacked but, well, you know,” Harley said. Harlan Industries was already on track to make thirty times the sales they’d projected for the year, and that number went up with every new desperate caller. “I got like seventy billion HR things to deal with because of the new expansions, but later lets do lunch, just the three of us, alright?”

“Sounds good. See you then,” Vell said. Lee and Harley gave him another quick hug and then sprinted off to tend to their respective goals. Vell wasn’t bothered by the high-strung schedule of his friends. The rush was overwhelming, but temporary. Things would settle eventually. They always did.

Vell sat down in his office, which still had quite a few boxes in it, and shoved them aside so he could sit at his desk. He took out his box, and set up a few things on his desk. Prickly the Cactus looked considerably less phallic after two years of growth. A picture of his parents, smiling back at him from their ranch back in Texas, served as a good reminder of home. The chaos rune Quenay had given him still floated, no matter where he tried to set it down, and spun slightly whenever he touched it, twisting to display flat stone or the glowing emblem of chaos.

For the final touch, Vell placed a multicolored ceramic elephant on his desk. It still didn’t make sense. It still didn’t have to.

With the decorations taken care of, Vell opened his briefcase and looked at all the research papers and reference documents he’d brought along, all the potential projects he could start. There were a thousand problems to solve, and a thousand ways to help people.

“Alright,” Vell said to himself. “Let’s get-”

“Vell!” Freddy screamed, as he slammed open the door. “Somebody tried to make something with the chaos rune and now the vending machine is evil!”

Freddy ducked as a ballistic pop-tart sailed overhead.

“Shit,” Vell said. “I’m on it!”

Vell raced out of his office and slammed the door behind him. On either side, the doors of Lee and Harley’s office slammed mere moments later.

“My bad,” Vell said. “I think I brought trouble with me.”

“We’re researching literal chaos magic, Harlan, it’s to be expected,” Harley said. She sidestepped a ballistic granola bar and turned to her friends. “Now one of you be in charge, we’re under snack attack.”

“Harley, focus on disabling the machine itself,” Lee said. “I’ll contain the damage. Vell, I trust you can handle the chaos rune’s unfortunate side effects?”

“Way ahead of you.”

He held up his own chaos rune, the first one carved, empowered by Quenay herself, and got to work right alongside Lee and Harley. Destruction was inevitable -but the three of them would just as inevitably be there to fix things.

I was sitting right next to her when the house started shaking so, of course, I felt it.

I nodded, “That’s the third one tonight.”

“What do you think’s causing it?” she got up and walked over to the window.

“I have no idea,” I joined her.

As we looked outside, all we could see was a curtain of snow making it impossible to see more than a dozen feet.

“It doesn’t look like it’s ever going to stop,” Rachele remarked.

“I’m going to go upstairs and check on Tina,” I gave my wife’s shoulder a gentle caress.

“Okay,” she replied, “I’m going to go into the kitchen and make some coffee. Do you want a cup?”

“Sure,” I replied, before heading to the stairs.

As I put my hand on the handrail and started climbing the steps, the house started shaking again. The tremors lasted twice as long and were forceful enough to almost knock me off my feet.

Concerned, I pulled my phone out and checked it to see if there were any alerts that might explain what was going on.

“Anything?” Rachele asked. She was watching me from the archway that led into the kitchen.

I shook my head and put the phone away, “No service.”

“At least we still have power,” she said.

“Knock on wood,” I said, rapping my knuckle against the wooden handrail before resuming my trek to the second floor.

Once I made it upstairs, I knocked on Tina’s door before opening it.

“You okay?” I asked as I entered her room and found her sitting on the bed.

“Not really,” Tina replied.

“What’s wrong?” I walked over and sat next to her on the bed.

“I think I did something bad,” she looked like she was about to cry.

“Why don’t you tell me about it,” I patted her leg, “I’m sure it's not as bad as you think.”

“Do you promise not to be mad?” Tina asked.

“I promise,” I said.

Tina turned around and reached for something under her pillow. When she turned back around, she was holding a snow globe that featured a large house in her hands.

“Where’d you get that?” I asked.

“Someone left it on the porch,” Tina revealed.

“Why didn’t you tell Mommy or me about it?”

“Because the card told me not to.”

“What card?”

Tina pointed at her nightstand, upon which was a small white card.

I picked up the card and read what was written on it. This is what it said:

For Tina, Don’t tell your parents, they won’t understand.

“Is this what you’re upset about?” I held up the card, “Not telling us.”

“No, this is,” she shook the snow globe. As she did, the entire house shook.

When she saw the shocked look on my face she started to cry.

“When I found the snow globe, I wished that we lived in a house like the one inside it,” she sobbed.",16,1735347157.0,shortscarystories,1,0.95,False

Imagine someone gives you nothing but blank paper- there are two kinds of people who will react differently to this. First type of people will be excited and gratefull for this simple blank paper and they would immediately start painting different art, pictures, writing things on it, throwing colors and they would create something out of one blank paper- Mona lisa for example or new ,,starry night''. And then, there is another type of people (that would be me in this lol) who would be dissatisfied and dissapointed with it and they would only see it as boring, useless and uninteresting blank paper and they would say- ,,Why did you gave me this? This doesn't amuse me, why didn't you give me mona lisa or ,,starry night'' ?

I hope my story I created isn't cringy to you and now I will just explain how this has anything to do with manifestation I hope I got your attention. So, I have problem manifesting some things; to be more specific I have problem manifesting social life that I really am satified with, and now-I also lost my relationship- which was really good from my perspective. My ex at closure even told me- you manifested this breakup, and that may be true. I reflected our whole relationship in this 5 months breakup period and I realised that there was a lot of moments when I HAD relationship, I had her, she was there just in front of me; sitting in coffee shop, laying in bed next to me and my mind was somewhere else, I was anxious about something else, i started fights over small things. I am that kind of person who would be on Maldivas sitting in the beach drinking cocktail and complain about sun lol. I often complained about everything. I can't remember when was the last time in my life when I sinecerely laughed or smile- not because of some dark daddy jokes - but because I am trully happy and grateful.

The thing is - I realized I will never get what I want because the reason I want those things (social life, my ex) is coming from the state of passive energy- like I want those things that I am not bored and lonely in my life, so that they AMUSE me. But what I have to offer? Do I really want to offer anything? Why do I want friends in my life? Do I want companions or I just want audience who will listen to my problems and be my cheerleaders and validate me.

I think, if we really want to manifest something we need to ask ourselves WHY we want it. It's not about correct tehniques it's about reason. Only when we become aware of the reason why we sincerely want something we can maybe work on correcting our thoughts but awareness is the key.

To make paralell with my anegdote from beginning- if we want to attract our SP we must NOT feel I want my SP to love me, I want SP to text me, do this and this to me-Because this is coming from a place of hurt ego, wrong narcisstic reasons, desperation. We must feel I want my SP back because I WANT TO LOVE THEM, no one will love them like I did, I want to make their life better.  But before that we also must ask ourselves deep inside, is it really true...? Because I also thought I loved my ex from 8 years ago and now I even laugh at the thought that I even dated that dude. We first need to be honest with ourselves was it trully love

One guy I know is really successful in manifestation (he is not doing it consiously) but I see that he has ,,luck'' in almost every aspect in his life ; he has huge social life (he is not extroverted and actually really shy), he has good job and he enjoys it. Whaevet he touches he turns into gold- but I noticed something about him- he is only conentrating on positive things in life- he belongs into the first group of people from my anegdote from beggining.",2,1735347019.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

1hntn5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1hntn5h/did_you_forget_i_was_schizophrenic/,Did you forget I was schizophrenic?,"The other day I was driving with my partner. We drove by the transition house I lived in after my first confinement in the psych ward. They mentioned a story I told awhile ago about the place. We continued on, no big deal.

Today we were out at a coffee shop talking about this Kafka Novella “the Trial” which deals with confinement, imprisonment and arrest… and we got to talking about forms of confinement. My partner started telling me a story about some friends who stayed in a transition house. I found myself getting really uncomfortable, like kind of having a panic attack, to hear a loved one describe second-hand something I had experienced first hand.

I said as much, that it made me feel ignored and invisible to have my own lived experience covered up by something heard second-hand. 

I think it would have been fine if they acknowledged that it was the same kind of transition house I had stayed in, that it was similar to my own experience, but the way they told the story, they felt it necessary to described the transition house as a place some people go to stay after leaving the psych ward. 

I said something like “Yeah… I know. I’ve told you this. We drove by the one I stayed in yesterday. We both know I lived in one of those places. I don’t need to be told what they are by someone who heard about them one time…” 

I’ve talked about my experiences with mental health many times in detail and my partner knows it was extremely traumatic for me. It sucks to feel like they’ve just forgotten who I am or what I’ve been through. I wasn’t really sure why I was upset when it happened. It was like they forgot who I was. It felt like my past was erased. Like some of my worst experiences in life were so something they had just forgotten. Eek. 

I’m not sure if it’s because we were in public, and my partner knows I don’t make my diagnosis public knowledge, maybe there was a concern someone would overhear…. Maybe they were being considerate… but I am surprised by how painful it was to have someone I care about refuse to name and acknowledge such a significant experience from my past.
