Anyways. I jus need some advice. i've been talking to this guy for almost a month now, and for three consecutive weeks, we’ve been going out to spend time together.  tonight (sunday) was the first time he finally had a day off after 2weeks (he didnt have a day off last week) so I expected him to ask me out, maybe grab coffee or just hang out, especially since he tells me “I miss you🥺🥺🥺"" almost every day. I even saved up just in case, though he usually covers most expenses. but nothing happened. I waited all week, only for this.

I was so frustrated I cried. honestly, I think this frustration is not even about him spending time with his friends~I get that. But he didn’t even bother to apologize or reassure me. also, it hurts because, for the first time, he didn’t greet me goodmorning, ask if I ate, or check in on me just plain updates, which felt so distant. And to top it off, he did invite me… but only when they were already about to leave. like, as if I’d randomly tag along to a guys night out with people i've never even met. I would’ve looked stupid.

now, we made plans about a week ago, he wants me to join him and his friends for a breakfast ride this sunday, but I’m thinking of not going and just heading back to my mom’s place instead. I feel like he doesn’t care enough to really pursue me, so why should I keep adjusting for him? What do you guys think?",0,1740348299.0,AdviceForTeens,1,0.5,False

1iwlt7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/masters/comments/1iwlt7j/first_timer_advice_things_id_do_differently/,First timer advice - things I’d do differently.,"I loved my Wednesday Practice round in 2024. However as people are planning their visit I’d recommend a few things.

1.  Enter the South Gate for faster access to the course.(I get the glamour of north gate but lines are less at South Gate)

2. If going Wednesday, Get to founders circle for your photo early as it shut down around noon for par 3. 

3. HAVE A MEETUP SPOT should you get separated.  We decided to meet at main scoreboard on :30 or top of the hour. 

4. Bring some kind of a camera, and multiple batteries, and sd cards. 

5.  If you can get a chair before you come and entered via South Gate put it on 16 with your card in it. No one will touch.  If you get to merch Early grab a chair and drop at 16. 

6. Walk the course 1-18 or at least 10-18. Others recommend walking it backwards, not the same.  

7. Plan to spend AT LEAST One hour in merch and the lines to merch move quickly but can take 30-60 mins to enter. Also, you can’t cut merch line. If you have your buddy get in line while you go to the restroom, you won’t be allowed to join.  We found merch lines were a little quieter around 2-3.  South Gate merch line was at capacity when we got in at 830am.  Be prepared to spend double your budget.  I budgeted $750. Spent $1750…lol. 

8. Ship or store your merch. Shipping is reasonable to lower 48.  The storage fills up.  You won’t want to lump your stuff around especially if warm. 

My suggested itinerary would be and what I would do next time:

Get to South Gate by 7am. 
Get merch and ship/store merch. Take chair to 16(plant it either behind green or half way up hill beside pond to see 15 and 16)
Grab a breakfast sandwich and coffee just up the hill from 16. 
Make your way to main scoreboard while checking the parings board(forgot the hole)
Get your photo at founders(Especially Wednesday)
Check out the range
Walk 1-9 stopping for concessions. Try every sandwich!! Get the peach ice cream!
Walk to 10-18. Take too many photos. 
If Wednesday go to par 3. 
Retire to your chair to watch players and caddies skip the balls across the pond. 

Enjoy it, take in every moment!!

1iwlrkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1iwlrkb/winter_in_madrid_in_manila/,winter in madrid / ? in manila,"it feels weird tagging this as stranger, but i suppose that's what you are now. is the winter passing already? are you keeping your feet warm? (did she buy you wool socks or does she not even know how much you love those?) are you actually still in madrid or did you travel with your family? (when your parents came, did you introduce her to them?)

i feel shameful even asking any of these things into the nothingness of the site we first met on, but well, maybe it's poetic. (or maybe it's just sad and i'm trying to cope by giving my grief some artistic purpose like i always do.)

i went out the other day wearing the very first watch i'd gotten since you got me hooked on horology. i hadn't worn it and honestly have barely looked at it since we last spoke. i wore it to the mall and as i passed by all the watch stores you don't have over there, i saw a turquoise casio you once said would look really pretty on me. it's funny writing this now and realizing that when i passed it that day, i didn't even think of you. as the clock ticks well past 0500 on this day, though, i regret that i immediately told you then that it wasn't my color. if i hadn't said that, would you have actually bought it for me? maybe at least i would have had a keepsake of our moments together. i keep asking myself now: why was our time so short and yet filled with a lifetime of hopes? i wonder if any of the plans you made with me actually meant anything to you. 

as i got back home that day, i realized i don't really look for you in my days anymore, but i still feel you in the little things: the wind through the open window at night (just like how you left it during our night time calls in the summer). being awake when the sun rises (because it's 0600 for me at your 0000). coffee with almond milk (and my judgy face as i sipped my double shot espresso). the ticking tocking movement of my oyster dial citizen (as you talk about regulating your NH35). the scars on my forearm beneath my tattoo (—the opposite side of the scar that almost killed you on the week i fell in love). 

the body truly does keep the score. my mind might choose to forget memories and i might often not even remember to miss people, but my body seems to refuse losing you. i'm not sure it knows how to. 

it's so odd how quickly it became accustomed to the routine we built together in those early months despite the long distance. my skin may have never been touched by you, but your presence enveloped it all the same. my clenched fists still attempt to ungrasp, hoping the timezones apart would make it easy; instead, it's a reminder of fingertips attempting to reach for a lost cause. i was so ready to jump towards you and now, these feet do not know where to go. 

i wanted to ask you back then if you truly meant it when you said you'd come back home to the philippines for me while you were high out of your mind after your surgery. but i knew well enough to leave it alone — i always said i don't like to ask questions if i can't accept the truthful answer. right now, though, i'm wondering if you would have liked me more if i was less rational and reserved, more reactionary and emotionally open — like the girls who asked if you'd still love them if they were a worm and you'd have to lie and answer yes even though the question didn't make sense to your male brain.

i still have so, so many questions and most of them probably feel stupid to you. like: when spring comes, could you even recall the first few calls we had when you were oddly surprised by how i understood you even when you didn't know how to word things or how much i remembered little details about you that no one else did? and when summer greets your face with dry heat will you even remember how tired you were when you still chose to play the guitar for me just so i wouldn't feel so alone like i always do on my birthday? when autumn creeps up and she probably gets you a greeting card or gives you a letter, would you cry like you often did every time i wrote you letters and poetry? when winter comes back around, would she still even be there or will you have yet another girl? 

as the seasons change, i hope you do too. i hope one spring day, you'll realize your watch has ticked time away and you're an entirely different man — someone who finally respects himself enough not to jump from one relationship to another once he's burnt out yet another woman because he's always fighting an invisible enemy. one day, if you return to this tropical climate, i hope you would have already figured out how to root yourself somewhere stable instead of running away from feelings that make you a ""weak"" human or constantly seeking out battlegrounds to conquer. i hope you eventually stop feeling like you have to fight your inner self all the time just to be societally acceptable and internally know you are worthy just by being you. i hope by then you can look in the mirror and recognize that cute little kid who once just wanted to hear someone accepted him as he was. i can't be the person who does it anymore, so if you see that familiar face, please tell him he is loved.",2,1740347903.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1iwlph7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iwlph7,"December wedding with 100 guests in Pasadena, CA under 10k - price breakdown.","Recently married the love of my life and honestly didn’t expect to stay under 10k in HCOL area but we managed to do it! This sub helped a lot with ideas and DIY to achieve this goal so I’m going to give my breakdown to help others:

Venue - $5,700
Included venue space, security, self parking lot for guests, tables, chairs, linens, napkins, silverware, plates, elegant gold head table, elegant gold head chairs, elegant gold dessert table, food (buffet style), drinks, dessert, staff/servers, gratuity, tax. 

The venue we chose looked really nice as is, so we knew we wouldn’t have to spend as much on decor. It was absolutely lovely. The venue was owned by a restaurant that operates next door to it, which serves Italian food and included in the cost. The food was served buffet style and there were lots of options to choose from. We ended up going with shrimp fettuccine Alfredo, beef lasagna, Parmesan chicken, Greek salad, Caesar salad, and grilled salmon. At the tables we also had appetizers of spinach artichoke dip, fried calamari, and flat bread. There was SO. MUCH. FOOD. whatever was left over from the buffet was put in tin trays (like 10 huge ones!!) and we gave out to either guests who would like got take it home or distributed to those in need. Dessert was also served, our choice of dessert was cannolis. The entire staff was honestly amazing and we had no issues with them at all. We opted for water juice coffee and iced tea for drinks. 

We had 2 hours to set up, 5 hours of event time, and 1 hour to tear down. We had all our decor ready and assembled beforehand and since the venue took care of napkins tables chairs plates silverware and majority of other things all we really had to do was put our centerpieces at each table and place our already arranged flowers and minor decor where we wanted it. Tear down was pretty fast too. 

I should note that our ceremony took place in the morning while this venue was dedicated for the reception in the evening. The ceremony happened at a mosque and was officiated by a religious officiant with 13 people present. The reason we chose to do this is because I have severe anxiety and thankfully my husband was very sweet about it and we opted for a small ceremony and larger reception to celebrate with everyone the same day. I mention this because the time between the ceremony and reception gave us our parents time to set up for the reception ahead of time, which they generously volunteered to do.  

I will not be naming the specific venue for privacy reasons but it was really gorgeous and if you’re local and would like to check it out for your wedding I’m happy to share that info via DM. 

Photographer - $550
For the ceremony we had a photographer for 2 hours. She took photos of our intimate marriage ceremony followed by family photos for the first hour and then just portraits and photos of me and my husband in a nearby park during the second hour. We got about 300 photos edited and sent to us within a week. By far my favorite investment!

Dress - $130
Got my dress online on a Turkish website with good reviews and it arrived within a week. I followed the size chart online and it fit me like a glove (US size 14). It was so comfortable and such lovely material. 

Flowers - $300
The day before the wedding, my mom and I went to the LA flower district in downtown and bought SO MANY FLOWERS for only $300. Our hack was to buy large already arranged bouquets of flowers so we didn’t have to buy individual types of flowers to see if they go together. Then we took the flowers in those already arranged bouquets and used them to arrange our own centerpieces. We filled any gaps with baby’s breath, which were really really cheap to get in large bunches. 

Favors - $220
Bought 100 favors for $220 custom made on Etsy. 

Photo Booth - $400
I didn’t have a professional photographer for the reception so I got a photo booth that did glam shots kind of like the kardashian style ones. It was a hit! We got it for 3 hours and got digital copies of all the photos afterwards. 

Cake - $550
We got a 3 tier cake for 100 people from a local bakery. Cost included delivery. Honestly looking back we could’ve saved on this by getting a cake cake and just distributing pieces of a sheet cake since most people thought the cake was fake anyways. 

Centerpiece parts/table numbers/etc. -$100
We got the gold ring style centerpieces on Amazon for like $20 and then got the foam for placing the flowers and tiny white bowls to arrange the flowers in. We got glued the bowls to the wooden pieces on the golden rings. The circular mirror trays were $20 also on Amazon. We had “share a memory” cards and gold pens also from Amazon which were $20 total. “Mr and Mrs” wooden decor also from Amazon $15. And then table numbers $20 on marketplace. 

Flutes/knives/etc with engraving - $130
Our golden Champaign flutes and fancy cake cutting knives were from things remembered gotten on sale for $50 and then we got them engraved for $80 at a local engraving shop. 

Seating chart - $100
I got a golden arched mirror on Amazon for $40 and then bought a template on Etsy for table number cards. We had 10 tables and I edited them easily in canva. This was really clutch because we had some last minute cancels from some guests and we edited the seating chart pretty easily. Got them printed at a local print shop 2 days beforehand for $30 on high quality paper. Got some wax stickers on Amazon for a couple bucks to place the table numbers on the mirror. Ordered a decal on Etsy with our names and date and welcome message. 

Misc. - $100
In case I forgot any little expenses. Only thing I can think of rn is the $15 custom cake topper from Etsy and my faux bouquet (everyone thought was real!) for $30 on Amazon. Oh and my tiara also from Amazon for $15. 

Wedding bands - $1000
Could’ve been cheaper but I really wanted to splurge on this lol. 

GRAND TOTAL: $9,280


Also my young cousin takes photos as a hobby and brought her nice camera and took very beautiful professional looking photos for us. I didn’t ask her to do this she just kindly did it. My sisters brought some film cameras and got cute film photos as well. 

We did not have a DJ, instead we curated a playlist ahead of time with our family members with 10 hours of music on it and connected it to the speaker system that was already part of the venue (amazing quality speaker system!)

There are definitely places we couldn’t probably cut some more expenses (like cake and wedding bands and photobooth) but overall I think we did good. I think investing in a DJ would have been worth it since some songs just go on for too long unless someone is there to transition them more nicely. 

I included a couple photos of head table and centerpieces to give an idea of what I’m talking about with expense descriptions :)",2,1740347747.0,Weddingsunder10k,1,0.75,False

It's a little like modern Dungeons & Dragons, but it's lower power and is more focused on problem solving.

I've written up a partially finished website that contains everything you might ever want to know about the campaign I want to run: https://publish.obsidian.md/sundered/README. Read as much or as little as you want.

I’m looking for players with a love of fantasy and an interest in old-school sandbox tabletop roleplaying. You don’t have to have played tabletop before; I'm happy to teach anyone the ins and out. Compatibility is key, so if you're interested, message me and we can meet for coffee or a board game over which we can chat about tabletop. If the vibe seems good, we can move onto the longer-running campaign.

1iwlfqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1iwlfqv/new_pleasures/,New Pleasures,"I thought I didn’t use food and drink for pleasure anymore, but I’m realizing I still do, because I’m kicking and screaming considering cutting out more (particularly dairy and coffee for Hashimoto’s). 

Did you go through this too? 

Where do you get pleasure in life? What do you use as reward? Celebration? 

I’m really struggling to get go of dairy and coffee when so many other pleasures feel like they’ve been “taken” from me in the last 4 months.

My current brainstorm:
- Walks at sunrise and sunset
- Vitamin D time (feeling sun on skin)
- Massages
- Good TV shows / books
- PRs in lifting
- Accomplishments (getting stuff done, seeing progress, inbox zero, habit streaks, a clean kitchen, organizing)
- My dog
- Close connections with partner or friends
- Physical touch from/with partner
- Smiles
- Hugs
- Hikes
- Learning

It all doesn’t feel “as good” as other things though like addictive substances and foods. Makes me so angry we’re taught that those things are normal and we just need moderation. 

Note: I’m sure it doesn’t help that medications have also altered my ability to feel pleasure that I’m working on getting off of for bipolar disorder. ",1,1740347043.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

1iwlbhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1iwlbhk/acupuncture_to_prep_for_transfer/,acupuncture to prep for transfer,"so I’ve been seeing an acupuncturist that was referred by my clinic. I’ve enjoyed seeing him it has helped me so much to relax my body and get my blood pumping all over. When I leave my body is tingly and I can literally feel my circulation flowing so much better… it’s a trip! I also feel so freaking relaxed after, between having a demanding business and the grief of one failed pregnancy through IVF I find the acupuncture super soothing and therapeutic. I plan on seeing him after the transfer once a week. If this second transfer sticks 🤞 I’ll continue through pregnancy bc I generally like the way it makes me feel! Anyways, I wanted to pass on a few tips he gave me for the gals in here coming close to a transfer. Who the hell knows if it helps but I’ll try anything! 

So he said a few days leading up the transfer and days after only drink only room temperate water,  no raw salads. I told him i was having one 8 oz cup of hot matcha in the mornings, and he said he would prefer I have coffee instead which I found interesting. He also said please eat cooked chicken, not fried of course, the day of the transfer and day after the transfer. 2 days leading up and 2 days after the transfer to eat pineapple after every single meal including the core. 

I do love the idea of holistic medicine since I’ve been pumping my body with so many meds over the past year. I thought his advice was interesting! would love to hear any negative or positive experience you’ve had with acupuncture during infertility. ",2,1740346738.0,IVF,1,1.0,False
1iwlbd1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iwlbd1,Vertical composter update,"Made this thing a couple of months ago, it’s been the replacement to my tumbler. Here’s my process and here’s what I’ve learned to do differently going forward:

Process:
After building, I started filling it with cardboard and coffee chaff. I work in coffee roasting so that’s an abundant byproduct. Then I added the tumbler contents and kept adding as my kitchen container filled up. Using a drill auger, I’d mix it up as much as I could, doing this got me up to 130 towards the bottom of the container.

Findings:
Starting out, I was unsure if I needed to add air holes on the side. Air flow is not a problem at this point, compaction seems to be a larger concern but it’s one that’s easily solved. 

The cardboard and chaff at the bottom was a mistake. The cardboard compacted on itself and prohibited airflow from the bottom, and the chaff was just too much to break down on its own. Even though it’s a green with lots of surface area, it has to be integrated with the rest of the compost to actually contribute.

In photo 3, I have the composter on its back with the door open, you can see the chaff on the left, just packed to kingdom come, and some surprisingly almost finished compost just to the right of that. So things are working, but the chaff was not helping drainage and airflow on the bottom.

No anaerobic pockets, just dry and packed on the bottom.

I removed about half of the chaff, mixed the remaining half with the rest of the contents, and stood it back up, then added in a bit of what I took out. Then I mixed it again.

Expecting some high internal temps again for sure, but as always things may go differently.

1iwla3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1iwla3e/my_experience_in_seattle_compared_to_los_angeles/,My experience in Seattle compared to Los Angeles,"I just recently visited the city again for President's day weekend after 7 years. It's such a unique experience seeing as how my last memory of the city was pre-pandemic. Here were my general observations during my trip:

* This is more of a commentary on the state of our global economy, but on our departing flight from LAX our terminal was completely dead/empty. Our flight to Seattle was half empty which was nice because we had the row to ourselves. But this was very surprising for a 3 day weekend.
* Aside from the poorly timed maintenance of the Light Rail, the public transportation system was and is still super reliable. We were able to travel throughout the city from Pioneer Square, to Down Town, to the Space Needle, and even Brewery Hopping in Ballard. The trains and busses were also a lot cleaner than what we're used to (smells of pee and weed).
* We stayed in Pioneer Square and the amount of fear-mongering posts on this subreddit is a bit much. Yes there are definitely displaced individuals, but for the most part it's a safe area if you are aware of your surroundings.
* I may be going to wrong parts of the city at night, but the night life seemed dead. I revisited Flatstick Pub and it was dead. When I last went years ago, it was packed on a Sunday night. This time around we only had maybe 10 or so people in the place.
* Pike Place is still busy with tourists and locals. This place feels exactly the same since the last time i've been.
* Didn't have an issue with it, but Police presence feels like it has increased in areas with high foot traffic. There were quite a few stationed throughout Pike Place and around public transport. The one's I encountered were pretty polite, I saw them politely ask a drunk displaced person to exit the train with no issues.
* So many options for museums, we don't think we would have even be able to see everything if we had a month's time.
* The coffee scene is immaculate. There's definitely good coffee in Los Angeles, but you need to kind of look for spots, whereas I would argue the floor of the quality of Seattle coffee is very high.

Overall we had a great time in Seattle. Will see you again in a few years.

Im thinking to apply for jobs I know I can do and have extensive experience in already so I'll require little to no training and be able to jump in and assist. 
In my case it's coffee shops I've worked in that industry for 6 years off and on before I got into health care,
In your best opinion would you hire someone if there were pregnant! No answer is the wrong answer some honestly would be helpful to steer me in a direction if I go for it and put myself out there or take the advice and humbly sit this one out and figure out other options.

Service was disappointing. Had to ask to order, had wave down waitress to pay. My nephew got and finished his pancakes before my pancakes even got to the table, so that’s definitely a fail. The regular $6.50 matcha latte was great, bit sweet though",14,1740346586.0,FoodLosAngeles,6,1.0,False

1iwl8z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iwl8z4/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_all_the_time/,AITA for not wanting to pay (all the time)?,"I (28F) grew up without money. Not just in the sense that I didn’t receive pocket money, but my parents struggled financially and didn’t have money to allow us things like eating out, going for shopping etc. It was what it was and while it sucked, I understood and accepted it. Now, my parents (mum and step dad) are doing pretty well now. I have a sister (16F) who gets pocket money, her and my mum often go out together to eat or just for shopping, a few times a month. I try to go out with my sister at least once a month. Me and my parents had arguments about these occasions, specifically the fact that any time I take my sister out, I’m expected to pay for everything. Not by her, but by my parents. Food, coffee etc. The last argument we had was about the cinema. Generally speaking, cinema is around £25 pp including tickets and snacks. For two people that’s £50. I’m not doing well financially and they never miss the opportunity to express their disappointment and give me sh!t about it. Fair enough. I messed up years ago and I’m paying the price now (I can see the light at the end of the tunnel tho). When I asked them to cover for my sister’s ticket at least, my step dad got pissed off and started going on about how I never have any money, and my mum’s reply was “you invited your sister out, when I invite someone out, I pay” I told her fair enough, but my sister is a child. Even when it’s her idea to go out, it’s not like I’m expecting her to pay for my stuff because again, she is a child. But if I always have to finance our outings then I can’t continue doing so with this much frequency. (I see her once a week for family dinner, so it’s not like I wouldn’t spend time with her otherwise, but this is bonding for us and due to the age gap I feel it’s important to have these together times.) 
Fast forward to today, me and my sister wanted to go out to check out some new makeup and I said to my sister to invite mum too cause she rarely comes with us. She got excited and agreed to come. Both my sister and I fancied some coffee so we decided to get some, but mum said she was fine. That’s where I might be the AH (on top of the previous bit). My sister asked mum if she’ll pay for her coffee. Mum looked at me and her immediate reaction was “you invited us to come with you”. Which I kinda replied back with that “you never invite me out when the two of you go out.” Basically telling her that yes, I did, but if I don’t then the three of us never spend time together. Then my sister jumped in to say that she was asking mum which is nothing to do with me, I didn’t ask mum to pay for me. The way I see it, our mum is responsible for my sister, so asking her to pay for her drink is normal, since she doesn’t have an income of her own. I don’t know how I got involved in that to be fair, but then she ended up paying for both of us. Again, I said to her that I’ll pay for my own coffee, the way I planned all along, but she still went ahead and paid for both. I’m not sure why I’m expected to pay for my sister or this whole “you invite me out, you should pay for me” situation. AITAH for not wanting to pay? I just want to spend time with the people I love without having to finance everyone. I know I’m an adult, I get that, but I feel like that I didn’t get to have these moments growing up and my sister does, which I’m really happy for, but somehow I should too contribute so she can have these moments. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind paying when it’s the two of us, but on rare occasions, I can only afford to pay my share. That £20-30 I spend on her once a month is totally fine. My issue is with that I’m *expected to*. So.. AITAH?

This is Tom Place. Small little diner basically on Ashland and 47th street. Back of the yards baby!

I. Pancakes - straight fuego 🔥. Notice the brown rings? I die for those little details.

2. Cheese Cake Stuffed French Toast - Ever had heaven on bread? This is close to that. Sweet but not overly sweet and super filling. I'm not a berries kinda guy, but that sauce, I'd slap someone for some more right now. 

3. Empanadas de Chorizo and Cheese - These are my favorite. These run out some times and rightfully so. The sauce drizzle on top blends a savory empanada with some fresh lime creamiest. And it works. Imma go get more right now. Broke and everything but why not.

4.Chorizo Omelet - Look, I'm a simple dude. This was simple. And I'm okay with it. It wasn't a highlight. But that's perfectly fine. They deck it out normally and I asked for it not to be. 

5 and 6. The Menu - It's easy, small, and best of all it's priced damn well. I see diner prices for north side spots and gotta tell myself I'm blessed. And the little story they have on the menu, it's cute and I appreciate it. 

Come get some everyone. Get some coffee. Get some food. When it's warmer, they got a patio so sit yo ass outside. Tom's Place is definitely a gem. 

I got some tacos for yall coming tonight. 🤪 ",1,1740346517.0,chicagofood,0,1.0,False
1iwl856,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iwl856,The Blank Signature • Renè Magritte • Galison Books • Over 500 Pieces,"Complete details from the box: 
- Renè Magritte (1898-1967)
- *The Blank Signature* (Detail), 1965
- Oil on Canvas
- National Gallery of Art, Washington Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Melon

I was drawn to the somewhat unsettling, thought-provoking image, only to find that this Galison Books puzzle from 1989 was made in Japan! The quality is distinctly different from modern Galisons and includes a random cut (reminiscent of a cross between NYPC, Cobble Hill, and Masterpieces), thick sturdy pieces, and a *very* crumbly fit. But I can look past it for such a remarkable image. 

From the [National Gallery of Art](https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.66422.html#:~:text=Home%3ECollection%3EThe%20Blank%20Signature,behind%20others%2C%20confusing%20the%20eye.): *A woman wearing a mauve-pink dress rides a horse through a wooded landscape with tall, thin, pole-like trees in this vertical painting. However, the bodies of the horse and rider are shown in front of some of the trees and disappear behind others, confusing the eye. The woman has pale skin and wears a brimless cap the same color as her dress over blond hair. She rides erect, holding the reins to the reddish bay-brown horse, which walks with the back left and front right hooves raised. The tree trunks are painted with sage and forest-green vertical dashes against moss green. The leafy canopies are painted with dabs of grass green. The forest in the background is indicated with short strokes of spring, sage, and mint green. The grass below is created with dashes of emerald green and coffee brown against a golden-tan background. Because of the way the horse and rider are unpredictably covered by trees, our eye constantly shifts back and forth, trying to figure out if the rider is close to us or set farther back in the forest.*

More on artist Renè Magritte [here](https://www.renemagritte.org/), whose portfolio includes [The Son of Man](https://www.renemagritte.org/the-son-of-man.jsp).

None of the Galisons I own look remotely like this one, so I went searching and found this from the [company website](https://www.galison.com/pages/about-us?srsltid=AfmBOopCxqGYvEZ4_Ei6OY0iGJjEgA-butj4_9Zg277FQOx1owB_cuvO):

1iwl75n,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iwl75n/arguments_leading_to_thoughts_i_dislike/,Arguments leading to thoughts I dislike,"I don’t really know where to start. My girlfriend (20f) and me (22m) have been pretty much fighting everytime we call. We’re long distance and I constantly am getting upset at her behaviors. Yesterday she (while on call with me) randomly got approached by some stranger (some random guy at her uni) crying about his breakup and said he needed someone to talk to. She for some reason thought the best course of action was to just cut the call with me without telling me anything and then just disappeared for around an hour. Came back and started telling me what happened because I asked. Midway through her explanation I asked her if she believed that the best thing she could have done was cut me off when some dude comes to talk to her. She says no and apologized, etc. we continue fighting and she said she believed it required more urgency than our call and so she did it. 

I mean sure? But why did she have to cut me? Like this is some random dude (allegedly). This isn’t the first time she’s abandoned me for someone. I’m constantly being put second. I didn’t get anything for valentines either and it’s because “it didn’t get to me in time so I couldn’t”. She said she’s bringing me one when she flies down. 

I’m just tired of being someone who puts in so much effort for her. I drop everyone for her. She knows she has me completely wrapped around her finger. But she would never do that for me. Even a random stranger takes priority over me. She evaluates everyone’s feelings except mine before doing anything. 

It’s gotten to a point that I’m so insecure, that I feel on edge all the time. 

I want to feel wanted. I can’t tell if she finds me attractive or not. I’ve lost so much weight and worked so much on my physical, I’ve refined myself. I’m in college for Biomedical sciences and I’m going into research after this semester. 

My need for feeling wanted has made me decide to go look for it somewhere else. I went out for a coffee with a classmate who has a boyfriend. But at least she appreciates me. At least she acts like it. I don’t know. I’m losing my mind. She’s good in every way except the fact that she makes me feel like she puts everyone except me on a pedestal. 

Maybe it’s because she knows I love her; that she no longer has to put in effort. She has me already and that’s the end. 

AND before anyone says anything. yes. I have spoken to her about it. I actually spoke about it a lot with her but it seems to only get better for a few days and then it’s back to another new method for the lady to make me feel shit.

I feel repulsed. I don’t feel as attracted anymore and I almost never feel the mood to compliment. She’s reinforcing that because everytime I’m like that. She turns into the most loving amazing girlfriend ever. 

Only then though.

I’m pathetic. I don’t know what to do

TL;DR

Girlfriend shows priority to other people constantly, making me more and more insecure. I’ve started seeking attention from others and feel horrendous.

Hey, I’m 26 from Western Europe! I’m looking for chats, friends, bros or whatever is going to happen between us! I’m pretty open to anything! 


A bit about me: I’m a homebody, I love to just relax at home, get myself cozy, play some video games, read or listen to books or just watch some good movies while drinking some tea or coffee. 
I’m also up for more active stuff like going on walks, riding the bike and I’m always down to try new exciting things. 


What I’m looking for: like I said I’m down to chat, become friends, have a bromance going or whatever fate has in store for us! I do prefer my men older however that’s just a preference. Look wise I’m pretty open, I don’t care if you’re super fit, skinny or if you’re a bear. Just be cool and yourself and we’re gonna have a great time! 


If you read this far and you’re interested to chat hit me up, tell me about your day, tell me your most embarrassing moment or whatever you want! Just please don’t enter the chat with just a „Hi“! ",2,1740346343.0,gayfriendfinder,0,1.0,False

1iwl5ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexualadults/comments/1iwl5ct/m42_first_date_after_divorce/,M42 First date after divorce,"I am feeling really happy and somewhat emotions washing over that me (M 42), divorced from wife (F 42) a year ago. We had filed a year before, but reconsidered. Then we then filed again, and eight months ago I moved out. 

It took me months to even start with dating apps, I downloaded Hinge and Tinder a month ago. I had hundreds of likes, a dozen matches, four coffees, and one 2nd date. 

My priority has been to take it slow, and identify the usual behaviors that I recall from the time I’ve been in the scene before college: dudes after fleeting encounters, dudes whining about not being in a relationship for 20 years and attracting the same garden-variety fleeting encounters, the usual stuff. I didn’t want any of that. Although I know that I don’t want to get married again (I appreciate my place, my time, my time with the kids) I wanted a connection, and affection, that I missed so much.

He’s younger, has a similar personality as mine, has a niece, same age as my son.  We went for a coffee first. On the second time, to the movies. We held hands,caress each other, held each other cheek to cheek, sat up close during the movie. I haven’t had that feeling in years. That warmth, that excitement, that affection, that connection, that possibility.

I still dwell with feelings of guilt — she always knew I was bi, and I always had attraction for men, but someone I couldn’t connect with them emotionally, only with women. And I never thought in the past 10 years of having an affair. 

Wife and I had experienced at least four years of distance, arguments, neglect, and loneliness. I love her, but it didn’t work. I still have poignant feelings thinking of us and our story. 

But now, maybe, after a long process of emotional distress, I start to experience some healing.

1iwl5aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1iwl5aq/how_do_you_reconcile_the_discipline_of_a/,How do you Reconcile the Discipline of a Dedicated Muslim.,"It seems to me that many dedicated, normal, and non influencer Muslims tend to live lives of a general discipline that is unmatched by other religions.

The general ""the West is dominated by Music, Drugs, Gambling, Interest, LQBTQ, Sexual Promiscuity, and Porn. All things haram in Islam"" argument.

The prayers, the behavior that is Haram, etc. I am in awe of the discipline.

It's also the most converted to religion, while being the hardest to practice. Just incredible really. 

Example: [https://youtu.be/GCQcr3J9UAQ?si=P0gKaSPGzF1IfGy\_](https://youtu.be/GCQcr3J9UAQ?si=P0gKaSPGzF1IfGy_)

\^ Dentistry Student, Healthy, Religiously Motivated, and Happy. Is that just it? I could never do that. It's genuinely impressive.

Most Notable in the Religion:

**Daily Structured Prayers**

* The five daily prayers are tied to specific times, not just “fit it in whenever you can.” This forces strict time management. Lots of faiths have weekly services, but the frequency in Islam is constant—multiple times a day—which seems to build routine and self-control in a way that stands out.
* **Ramadan’s Annual Test of Willpower**
   * A month with no food or water from dawn to sunset is hardcore. Everyone else is grabbing lunch or sipping coffee, and you have to wait until sundown. Doing that year after year builds unreal levels of willpower and teaches you to control urges.
* **No Alcohol, No Gambling, etc.**
   * Social drinking and casual gambling are the norm for many people. But devout Muslims draw a hard line. No “just a little bit,” no “special occasions”—it’s simply haram. That kind of steadfast “no” stance in a world that’s constantly offering you a drink or a bet is discipline in action.
* **Music is Haram**
   * For many practicing Muslims (who follow the strict interpretation), music is straight-up forbidden. So in a society saturated with streaming services, radio hits, and club tracks, they often avoid it entirely. That’s a massive sacrifice when you think about how music is woven into almost every aspect of modern life—shopping malls, TV shows, background noise at restaurants, etc.
* **Accountability to God Over Society**
   * The concept of “Taqwa” (God-consciousness) is huge. It means you always remember that God is watching, so you hold yourself accountable even when nobody else is around. That inner sense of responsibility often outlasts any external rule or fear of being judged by others.
* **Community Support**
   * In Muslim communities, people reinforce each other’s discipline. From breaking fasts together during Ramadan to reminding each other about prayer times, the communal aspect helps keep everyone on track. It’s the ultimate form of positive peer pressure.
* **Comprehensive Lifestyle Guidelines**
   * Islam covers finance (avoid interest/usury), modest dress codes, dietary laws (halal), and etiquette. It’s not just a Sunday religion; it’s a full blueprint for daily life. This interconnected system naturally fosters discipline because you’re guided in practically every aspect of living.
* **Reduced Stress from Clear Boundaries**
   * Having a strict set of rules can actually bring peace of mind. You don’t constantly wonder, “Should I or shouldn’t I?” There’s a moral framework that you accept and follow. Daily prayer and spiritual focus can also reduce anxiety by giving a sense of purpose and order.
* **Practical Lifestyle Impact**
   * All this structure often translates into less substance abuse, more organized days (waking up for early prayer can help you start your day right), and tighter bonds within families and communities. Of course, no group is perfect, but the framework itself pushes for a more disciplined approach to life.",0,1740346289.0,DebateReligion,7,0.38,False

1iwl2ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/NJTech/comments/1iwl2ki/tourist_advice_please/,"Tourist Advice, Please!","Hey everyone! I'm visiting NYC this coming weekend for my semi-annual visit to a famous venue (it's NYR @ MSG Sunday night this year), and I always try and see another something sporty off the beaten path during these trips, and the Saturday afternoon NJIT game fits my schedule perfectly. I know the team is taking it on the chin this season, but the WEC seems like a really nice venue, and in all my trips to NYC over the years, I never really have spent much time in Newark/Jersey City.

Which leads me to the reason I posted here: my hotel is in Jersey City so most of my nighttime stuff will be either there or across the river. But, I'd love recommendations for some notable local NJIT campus-adjacent (looks like downtown isn't far away either, so that works as well) establishments, preferably locally-owned or at least locally-proud. Restaurants, taverns, bars, delis, coffee, any and all are helpful, as I intend to spend most of my Saturday in Newark. One final note: I GM'ed a bar on-campus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for fifteen years, so I'm just as comfortable at ""college"" places as I am at more upscale, so no suggestion will be seen as a bad one.

I await the help, and thanks in advance!",1,1740346089.0,NJTech,2,1.0,False
1iwl2fh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1iwl2fh/wife_of_9yrs_has_been_cheating_1yr/,Wife of 9yrs has been cheating 1yr,"Found out 2 nights ago my (M36) wife (F38) of 9 years (together 15) has been sleeping with a coworker, at work, for the last year-ish. 

She says she loves me and our sex life and our life in general ( we have 2 kids, good careers, house, dog, etc). She says this wasn’t about finding something we were lacking but just individual urges and that some people aren’t programmed to be monogamous and she’s been feeling this way lately (her parents were semi open and she’s a nurse which apparent is a large swinging/cheating community)

It all really started late 2023. We had sex on her birthday and I choked her a little for the first time ever. This sparked a wild sex drive that has honestly last ever since. Prior to that she’s always been kind of vanilla.

Dec 2023 this guys wife messaged me saying that our spouses had been messing around to some degree. She sent me a screen shot of my wife’s apology to her stating it was just dirty talk that she was using to work herself up and screw my brains out when we go home. Still says they weren’t doing anything else at that point. And it only started bc she was bragging about our new sex life to coworkers. 

They started screwing a few months later. Dirty talk, oral, all kinds of sex (styles which she has said we would NEVER do)….they call each other pet names like babe (which she also told me she hates). They say “I love you” but she claims she doesn’t.

She says she sorry she hurt me and thought I knew and just didn’t want to make a big deal about it as I told her way back when “if you ever cheated I wouldn’t want to know”….I said that not bc we’re strong enough to last anything but bc I would want to physically hurt someone…

The crazy thing is I’m not sure I even want a divorce…I do love her and don’t want to leave, to split our family….I just want her to stop…


That nigh last night I took a 2hr drive and came back to sleep in the guest room.

I laid in the guest room bed all morning while she’s downstairs with the girls. Then got up made a coffee and went on a 2hr walk. 

I’m hurt. I feel like a fool. Betrayed. 

We have talked, she says she’s going no contact and that our life is more important than anything and fixing our relationship is priority. That’s what I want…I can get over it eventually. And I’m not even 100% opposed to somewhat of an open marriage (maybe like 90% at this point) as long as we are on the same page and not doing anything behind someone’s back.

I told her yesterday, 1 out of line text, snap, message, call, physical encounter and I’m filing for divorce. She acknowledged and said it’s over that her priority is doing what she can to help me heal, help us heal, even switching jobs or going remote. 

We cried, we held each other, we slept together, it’s been semi normal since. I’m still depressed, which I assume will last a few weeks. 

Now I’m torn if I let the guys wife know, and if so what backlash does that bring on my wife. 

It’s been a roller coaster of emotions. I don’t really feel like I can talk to any friends/family bc I feel like everyone would hate her and tell me to leave, which I don’t want. ",9,1740346079.0,Infidelity,35,0.71,False

Been playing on and off since beta and the last time I played was 8 months ago. To get straight to the point, could anyone please answer for me:     
     
1. Are there any major changes to the buffs for a bloodied commando build? Currently have blight soup, ballistic bock, overdrive, small guns bobbleheads, Guns & Bullets 3 magazines, company tea, coffee and all the camp buffs. LL3 was nerfed apparently so I've gone back to GB3, hoping it's not still bugged.     
2. What events do people do for legendaries? Is it still Eviction Notice and if not, is there anything better? Are raids worth doing?     
3. Are there any new ""must have"" camp items?
4. I've got 5.5k scrip and 9.4k gold bullion. Anything in particular I should use it on?     
     
I'm level 624 with Q50c, QE and Q25 railway rifles and a mix and match of Unyielding stuff and from what I've tried it on so far, my character is still really strong. I quit when I had nothing left to do so essentially, I'm wondering what's new that's worth doing!

1. **Promenade des Anglais:** This iconic stretch along the Mediterranean is a must. Whether you're walking, cycling, or just sitting by the beach, the views are incredible, and the breeze is perfect. Grab a coffee at one of the beach cafes or just enjoy the peace by the pebbled shore.
2. **Explore Old Town (Vieux Nice):** The narrow, colorful streets of Vieux Nice are full of charm. You’ll find cozy restaurants, local markets, and vibrant energy. Make sure to try **socca**, a local chickpea pancake—it’s a must! And don’t miss **Cours Saleya**, the lively market filled with flowers and fresh produce.
3. **Castle Hill (Colline du Château):** If you love panoramic views, this is the spot. The climb to the top gives you sweeping views of the city and the sea. Go at sunset—it’s absolutely breathtaking.
4. **Day Trips:** If you have extra time, I’d highly recommend day trips to **Èze** or **Monaco**. Both are close to Nice and offer even more of that Riviera magic.

Nice is one of those places that gives you the perfect balance between relaxation and culture. Whether you're chilling by the sea or exploring the vibrant streets, it’s a destination that will definitely leave you wanting more.",1,1740345899.0,Visitmediterranean,0,1.0,False

I've wiped out more times than most of you went down a slope and broken every bone between my neck and my big toe...

Today, my trusty flows gave out. The binding came off my board, I lost all control and I almost murdered an entire class of 5-year-olds and their ESF monitor. I'm lucky to be alive 😀
The kids are mostly fine, too. 

Either way, I'm old, decrepit and I fucking hate strap bindings. I get winded just trying to bend down and close them. Laugh all you want, you'll be old one day too. 

Now that I have to replace board and bindings, I reckon why not go for the Burton step ons?

What's your take?

I ride quite often. About 60 to 80 days per season, but as stated, I'm old so I go up, come down in a leisurely pace, have coffee and genepi with my friends and do it again.

Would this system work for me or should I just try to get new flows?

Thanks a lot for your input. You may now mock me. I don't care, you'll want to be me one day 😀😀😀

1iwkvtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1iwkvtp/idk_if_shell_ever_reach_out_again/,Idk if she'll ever reach out again,"I was with my gf for 7 months. She told me it was over on February 16th. She got distant in January. I asked if she'd lost interest 3 weeks ago because of that, she said no and she was just depressed. She has sunk into a bad depression hole, struggling to do things etc. She dumped me because she told me I was so great and deserved better, that her mental health is falling apart and that she loves me and always did, but she can't be the person I need/want her to be, and that I can do so much better than her. She was begging me not to leave her life, she said she knows everyone says it but she wants to stay friends because she doesn't want to lose me, she really doesn't want me to leave, she hopes I don't leave, etc. I think her attachment style is fearful avoidant. I'm anxious leaning secure because I'm in therapy and have been. She told me because she's depressed she has no energy for anything, like going on dates etc. She also told me she needed space and distance to realise this. She can't get out of bed and when she does for work, she goes home and just wants to lie and rot there. She said she has to work on herself and it's not fair on me so she needs to be alone to do it, and she can't put her baggage on me, and I deserve better. It was a long ass convo. I texted her later that night saying I felt like my time was wasted. She told me all the Same stuff again, but said she was sorry she was a waste of time and she doesn't want to lose me. I took hours to reply, and I said ""idk If I should respond to this because I don't want to look stupid."" And then I said that I didn't want to lose her from my life either, but I need space to get over this and focus on me. I said being friends right now isn't healthy for us. I then told her she wasn't a waste of time and apologised for saying that. I told her I love her and always will (probably a mistake but I was emotional). I told her I hoped she would message me whenever she's ready to talk, that I won't leave and if she needs me to just reach out. And when she's ready, just reach out to me overall. Which looking back, is very embarrassing because it comes off as begging. She didn't respond to it. She posted on her private story a few days later and I was on it still. It was a photo of coffee, then a video of her dog. I posted on my story today, and she looked at it IMMEDIATELY, like in the first 5 minutes of it being up. It was a bracelet my little cousin had made for me with my initial on it. It was so cute and I posted it because I thought it was cute. I said it was my cousin who made it for me. My ex has a bracelet with my initial on it herself, so I must admit, I posted that story to make her remember that. And just to see what she did. My plan is to stay no contact and not to post on social media, especially nothing about breakups or moving on etc. I know this entire posts makes me sound pathetic and ridiculous. I just feel like our relationship ended when it could have been fixed. I feel like if she works on herself, which will take time ofc, we could maybe come back together someday in the future. And obviously I need to work on myself too. I know it would all take time to work through. And I know I might sound completely ridiculous saying all this. I guess what I'm asking is, what do I do? It bothers me that I don't know what the future holds. But I can't wait for someone, and I also can't reach out because it needs to be her given all this context I feel. And I also need to respect her wishes. I just have hope in my heart that our story isn't over. I really feel like this is the love of my life. I'm trying to move on, but I hope she messages me at some point in the future. I haven't blocked her on anything but we're in no contact. I'm worried I made myself look stupid because I said some emotional stuff, but she was being emotional too. One of my loved ones told me it's a good sign she looked at my story. She looked at it really fast, less than 10 mins. But idk if that says much. I know this message is all over the place, thank you in advance if anyone reads it. I just don't know what I'm doing. I've had horrible breakups before but this one is different because I truly feel like this is the love of my life and there's still love between us. But I know that she needs to work on herself, for herself. And she has to be the one to reach out. I feel like I'm trying to move on with hope in my heart that we'll get back together someday. I feel like I'm doing stuff with that in mind. Like I'm staying no contact to respect myself and her, but also because I'm hoping it helps us get back together. I just don't know what I'm doing. I wish I knew the outcome. I feel like I deserve better, but part of me wonders if she'll ever come back one day. And I find it hard to deal with not knowing why she hasn't reached out. If it's to give me space, because she doesn't know what to say, or because she doesn't care and it's all lies. Thank you in advance if anyone reads this.",1,1740345616.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

#My Completed 1911

[View of the left side](https://imgur.com/8hd84pC)

[View of the right side](https://imgur.com/C5Qpb91)



#Overview
The course was Monday through Friday from 8am-5pm at Gunsite in Paulden, AZ and cost $2,800 ($1,500 for the class fee, and $1,300 for the Rock River Arms 1911 build kit) not including lodging, meals, or a rental car. I have summaries of what we did each day, but I prefer not to post it since I feel that would be spoiling the experience. Matt also had an assistant, Brian B. who was an FBI HRT special agent so we got to see the technical gunsmithing perspective and the operational perspective. They were both extremely helpful in fitting, lending their experience and skill when I or someone else got hung up. Because of that, everyone was able to progress and keep up with the pace of the class. At the end of the class, we left with a functional ""body-in-white"" 1911 that needed at least a 500 round break-in period before any coating of which Matt recommended a Parkerize or Bluing be done first before any coloring.

#Lodging
Gunsite offers onsite camping options however since I didn’t utilize them, I don’t know too much about the logistics. I stayed at the [Days Inn by Wyndham in Chino Valley]( https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/days-inn/chino-valley-arizona/days-inn-chino-valley/overview)  and was actually very surprised at the service: they offered complimentary eggs, potatoes, and sausage for breakfast that was actually cooked very well with juices, coffee, and milk. While the amenities and furniture are very basic, I enjoyed my stay here more than some 3+ star hotels I’ve stayed in. The Days Inn is approximately 20 minutes South of Gunsite so you’ll have to factor that in when commuting however there was no rush hour traffic to be caught in. For rental cars, I had a personal vehicle but if you’re flying in for the course, you’d likely have a rental car already from Sky Harbor in Phoenix. I did not check Uber’s availability but since Paulden is a very small town, I don’t think there is enough drivers.

#Meals
$13/day catered by a Gunsite contractor and is the most convenient option since Gunsite is significantly located away from any food places for obvious reasons of being a large acreage shooting facility. The contractor offered sandwiches or salads and they were actually very good. Virtually all of us went the catered route as it gave us some time to chat about our backgrounds or the class. At lunch you also got the opportunity to check out the [ProShop](https://gunsitestore.com/) or [Fink’s Gunsmithing]( https://finksguns.com/) both of which were located on-site. I had no dietary restrictions but I’m not sure if there were any accommodations on the menu for this as I wasn’t looking for it.

#Rock River Build Kit
Since this is a build class, you need to buy the kit that contains all the parts you will be fitting in the class. You’re supposed to contact Deann [Rock River Arms](https://www.rockriverarms.com/) to buy the kit for the class. I personally sourced my own slide/frame and parts since when I stumbled upon the Gunsite course page, I saw “Caspian Arms slide and frame” called out so I began to source that. It wasn’t only until after I had placed my order with Caspian that they had updated the website to the Rock River Arms kit. Low key, I personally wanted a Caspian slide/frame anyway. Having a different slide/frame did help with the class a bit since Matt would talk about the slides/frames in general and would refer to my kit as an example of what’s different so that other students could look and compare.


#Class Demographics 
All male class 12 in total with ages skewed on the older side. Mix of experienced pistolsmiths and novice builders like me. Some were doing it for fun (also me) and others to augment their firearms business. 

#My Final Build
I’ll list as if you were selecting it off of [Caspian’s Website]( https://caspianarms.com/product-category/government-5).
##Caspian Arms Government 5” Carbon Steel Slide
- 45 ACP (Lesson learned here: the firing pin hole is sized for a 9mm firing pin. Matt had to exchange my pin which was the original 45 ACP pin size which was larger. The rationale of going to 9mm-sized pins was likely for standardization and popularity; one pin that can do the job of both 9mm and 45 ACP)
- Series 70
-  Recon Radius (ball end cut)
- Serrated Flat Top (Extra cost)
- Caspian Standard Rear Serrations (Extra cost)
- Classic/Standard Front Serrations (Extra cost)
- Novak Lo-Mount Rear Sight Cut (Extra cost)
- Novak Style Front Sight Cut (Extra cost)
- C and Wreath only
- Lowered and flared ejection port (This was default)
- I did not have a reverse plug cut nor a bevel package.

##Caspian Arms Government 5” Carbon Steel Recon Receiver
- Government Model
- Series 70
- Integral Plunger Tube (Extra cost)
- 45 ACP feed ramp
- 0.25” beavertail radius (Extra cost)
- 20 LPI front strap checkering (Extra cost)
- Standard Caspian serial number
- 3 slot picatinny rail (On the “More Options” page)
- No drilling and tapping, gunsmithing work, ejector installation, plunger tube installation, grip screw bushing installation  (We did all this in class).

I had a Kart EZ fit barrel, Cylinder and Slide pre-fit fire control (hammer, disconnector, and sear), and an Atlas X-Line Flat Long Silver. Authentic Novak sights that I need to readjust windage on. Magpul 1911 TSP grips which Matt was a fan of in general.


#Questions and Answers

**DISCLAIMER:** These answers are paraphrased and not verbatim since I was taking notes as fast as I could on my phone but I believe they fulfill the intent of the question.		

QUESTION | ANSWER 
---|---
[I would like to know if he believes the 1911 is still competitive as a service pistol, and why/why not.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/mby2vp3/)| Brian: Yes. It can be fitted to suit the user whereas a Glock is more of a one-size-fits-all. 
[What's the preferred recoil system - flat spring? What weight? Shok buff? Full length recoil spring guide rod or not?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/mbxuq6b/)| Matt: Not a fan of Shok-Buff. You’re detrimentally changing the characteristics of the recoil action by adding a dampener that degrades over time anyway.
[Is there a preferred choice of ammunition?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/mbxquz4/) | Brian: [Remington Golden Saber 45 ACP bonded]( https://www.remington.com/handgun/golden-saber-bonded/29-29327.html). Feeds well, punches and expands through intermediate barriers. 
[What is the most rugged magazine? What is the most rugged extractor?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/mbxw7lb/) | Matt: [Chip McCormick Railed Power Mag]( https://cmproducts.com/1911-magazines/railed-power-mag.html). Extractors from reputable companies are all good. Just needs good tensioning.
[How absolutely devastating is it to have a MiM part in a pistol?]( https://www.reddit.com/user/G_McGanksta) | Matt: It’s application specific. Low stress part like a grip safety is fine. A sear, probably not. 
[Are 2011’s really reliable?](https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/mbygr7b/) | Did not ask however Brian did say he was surprised by the Springfield Prodigy’s value for what you got.
[Best production 1911 for duty/carry if left completely stock?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/mbyr8y2/) | Brian: The Springfield Prodigy is really good value. Was pleasantly surprised at the price tag. Matt: Gave props to Rock River for providing the kit; did have good things to say for Springfield.
[Why did the FBI HRT change the Specification for the 45acp pistol from a high capacity 14rd magazine model using the Para Ordnance frame then switched to a standard 7/8rds Magazine 1911? At that time Para Ordnance was wining championships in all shooting leagues that allowed high capacity 45acp and the issues with the Para Mags were being over come with Infinity High Cap Mags. So what changed the FBI/HRT mind to switch other than cost of the Magazines?](https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/md14ma3/) | Matt/Brian: Switched in ~2005. Had trouble with the 14 rounder. Contract for single stack was going through so it was preferable to just continue with that than to figure out 14 round. 
[This is awesome man, thank you for looping us in with the opportunity! I would appreciate his perspective on slide to frame fit. I’ve read and consumed a lot of content about the subject, and get the general premise that a little looser on the tolerances is said to be better for duty/carry with debris/junk potentially causing issues on super tight fits… but the tight fits being preferred otherwise for precision, accuracy for target and range action. Ive seen so many conflicting perspectives on the matter coming from credible sources in the industry so would love his take. Thanks again!](https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/mc0sgai/) | Matt: Loose tolerances does NOT correspond to better reliability; it allows stuff to get in and mess with it. A tight fit can be made reliable.
[Have we truly reached the pinnacle of 1911 design and engineering? Where do you see the market going on 1911singlestacks/2011doublestacks?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/mc367eq/) | Matt: There’s some things out there that are more gimmicky, but likely yes.
[I believe HRT uses Glocks right now, but I know for a fact they're considering the Staccato HD]( https://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/1iltwcu/any_questions_for_matt_gish_fbi_hostage_rescue/mc3f38z/) | Matt: HRT is using Glocks. Wouldn’t be surprised if Staccato takes law enforcement market. Likely switching to Staccato HD.
What coatings do you recommend? | Matt: Parkerizing or Bluing before any Cerakoting. Recommended Fink’s Gunsmithing which was located on-site.
Is there a mission set where 45 ACP is preferred over 9mm? | Brian: Caliber agnostic. Matt: Fan of 45 ACP for the larger expansion. Better chance of hitting something critical.
Were there any specific modifications HRT used for their issued 1911s? | Did not ask.
How can I prevent scratching from the reinstallation of the slide release lever? | Matt: GO SLOW. Don’t be in a rush to put it back in.
What helps with trigger pull? What goes into a trigger job?| Matt: Polishing the disconnector face that’s in contact with the sear spring tang, polishing the sear spring tang face, polishing the disconnector round head. Setting the overtravel screw to eliminate overtravel while making sure you don’t get any sear rubbing on the hammer. Adjusting the leftmost tang for trigger pull weight.
What is typical extractor tension weight? | Did not ask.
What do you think of the Clark Custom split sear spring? | Brian: Not too familiar with it/haven’t used it.",3,1740345481.0,1911,0,1.0,False
1iwktrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1iwktrg/today_i_tried_brewing_with_good_water_this/,"Today I tried brewing with ""good"" water. This changed everything!","I have been brewing as a hobbyist for about 1 year now, and have been investing in quality coffee, grinder, kettle, filter paper, etc. I watched dozens of videos on how to brew, different recipe, etc. 

I always used tap water because in Austria where I live, tap water is supposed to be good.

But I never matched the coffee of my favorite local coffee shops, even though I was buying the same coffee beans! Frustrating.

Until today... I bought a bottle of water with recommended minerals concentration for coffee. This changed everything! It is like I unlocked a whole new level in my home brew. I am now excited and impatient to test and re drink all my coffees just to rediscover them. :D

I checked my local tap water, and it has a hardness between 18 and 20 dH (more than 240ppm); which is considered as very hard water. Not surprising and now everything make sense. 

So, take my bad experience as a small reminder to check the water you are using for your brews \^\^

Is there something else I am missing that could heavily influence my coffee?

1iwkt0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1iwkt0k/trip_report_waldorf_astoria_orlando_disney_world/,[Trip Report] Waldorf Astoria Orlando Disney World Stay,"Spent a weekend here taking P2 to Disney World. Spent 90k HH points x 2 nights. Inquired about upgrading 2 days before we arrived and was offered a 1 bedroom ""Family"" Suite with balcony for $60 extra per night. Took it since that's a no brainer at that price. I did get charged ~$6 in taxes per night but didn't bother fighting that. I've seen reports accepting an upgrade can convert your reservation into one that becomes eligible for resort fees but this did not occur for us. 

Burned $200 worth of Hilton GC's about as easy as could have been

Cash rate for the suite was about $1200 per night vs 90k points and $60 per night

No amenities advertised were in room, housekeeping had no problem bringing them up. Sorry I didn't get pics of the bathroom or breakfast, but you can find them identical to what you see online. The suite bathroom is bigger than the standard room

Breakfast buffet was actually quite on point. I'm normally not a fan of traveling just to eat hotel breakfast but I was pretty impressed with the spread. Expect to pay $50 out of pocket for 2 people (after applying $50 my way dining credits) and I'd say it's pretty worth it. Tons of options and the bakery items were great. On checkout day we went to their ""croissant bar"" which is catered to people making a quick exit at checkout or going to the parks, croissant and egg sandwiches and coffee were solid and about $40 total for both of us.

On check in day everything was really crowded and had long waits. The bartender in the lobby bar gave us a heads up that we should put our name down anyways for dinner at Bull and Bear because they usually get you in quick and as promised they did. I'd probably skip it next time, it was probably average which was surprising based on all the reviews I've seen. The steak looked like they slid it around before serving our table. Cocktails in lobby bar were good but expensive. My friend who stayed with us said in room dining was good but just a heads up it could take a while to eat here if you get in on an empty stomach.

All in all, I would definitely come back and this makes a solid and convenient ""Points Redemption"" if you want to stay in the heart of the Disney area. I would probably do the Conrad next time just to check things out. I have never stayed at the WA pre renovation but overall we had a wonderful time.

[part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1iw6oui/homework_bestie_part_9/) here, Go and read that first! 

After our talk, there was a knock on Jenny’s door, and her mom peeked in.

“Hey, sweetheart,” she said, smiling at Jenny before glancing at me. “Could you give me a hand with the laundry?”

Jenny groaned, stretching out on her bed. “Ugh, I’m so tired. But he can do it,” she said, nodding toward me with a lazy grin.

I didn’t even hesitate. “Of course.”

Jenny shot me a quick thumbs-up before rolling onto her side, already scrolling through her phone again.

I followed her mom downstairs to the laundry room, where a fresh load of clean clothes sat in a basket. She sighed, rubbing her neck. “I was going to fold everything, but it’s been such a long day. You don’t mind handling this, do you?”

“No problem,” I said automatically.

She patted my shoulder. “You’re such a sweetheart.” And just like that, she walked off, leaving me alone with the laundry.

I took a deep breath and got to work, sorting and folding each piece of clothing carefully, just like I had a dozen times before.

As I stood there folding the whole family's laundry I suddenly found what I could only assume was Jenny's panties. My heart started beating and I could feel my cock throbbing in my pants as I stood there holding the panties of the girl I loved. 

My cock started throbbing even more as I thought of Jenny wearing those panties all day long, all her juices gathering and soaking up into it. Every step she took and every time she got horny looking over at her crush. Her smell was amazing, I loved it and worshiped those panties like I knew nothing else. I got lost in a trance smelling her wonderful panties but was snapped out of it when I heard Jenny's mom walking towards the laundry room.

I quickly put the panties in my pocket so I didn't get caught and started focusing on folding the laundry, each piece neatly stacked, trying to make it look as perfect as possible. I tried to not focus on the panties in my pockets as I continued with the rest of the laundry. The rhythmic folding calmed me a little, but it wasn’t long before Ms. Thompson was in the room. 

She entered, glancing at the pile of laundry. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she took in the progress.

“You’re taking your time, huh?” she said with a smile, crossing her arms. “I could use a little more help in the kitchen, too. Can you do the dishes when you’re done here?”

I quickly stood up, smoothing out my shirt, and nodded without hesitation.

“Of course, I’ll do them,” I said,"" feeling like I had no other choice right now but to say yes.

She gave me a nod of approval. “Thanks, I appreciate it. You’re a good kid.”

I smiled back and with that, I finished up the laundry and made my way to the kitchen, ready to take on the next task.

As I started doing the dishes, Jenny walked into the room, looking a bit frustrated. She was holding a piece of clothing in her hands and gave me a curious look.

“I'm missing something from my laundry, do you know where it is?""

I glanced at her, trying to stay casual. “No, I don’t know where it is.”

But Jenny narrowed her eyes at me, clearly sensing something wasn’t right. “Are you sure? Because you look like you know something.”

I felt my heart rate quicken as I hesitated.

I looked at her once again, ""No, I don't know where your underwear is.""

Jenny’s expression shifted from frustration to surprise. “I never said anything about any underwear. I was talking about my purple socks. What did you to do my panties?""

Oh shit, I thought to myself. Did I just snitch on myself? 

Jenny crossed her arms, with an angry look on her face just waiting for my answer.

""I took your panties while I was folding the laundry but only because I was holding them when your mom walked into the room and I panicked and put them in my pocket.""

She put out her hand, ""Give them to me now!""

I drag my hand to my pocket and pulled the panties out and put them into her hand all without looking at her because I was too embarrassed. 

She closed her hand and turned out of the kitchen without saying a word.

Then her mom popped her head into the room, ""I think you can go home now. I will take care of the rest. Thank you for the help.""

As I walked out of the house, I wondered how my relationship with Jenny be now. She seemed really mad at me.

**Part 11**

I was lying in my bed, thinking about what I had done at Jenny's house, regretting everything. I hoped Jenny wasn't too mad at me, but I had no idea, as she walked straight out of the kitchen without saying anything.

I decided the best thing to do was to text her and beg for forgiveness.

""Hey Jenny, I'm so sorry for what I did, and I will do anything to make it up to you.""

One hour went by with no answer, then another hour without a response. I wrote to her again.

""Please, Jenny, I screwed up. Please let me make it up to you.""

As soon as that message was sent, I saw it said ""Read"" under it. She had seen my message. Now I just had to wait for her reply. But it never came. It was almost midnight, and still no answer.

I went to bed not knowing what was going through Jenny's mind. All I knew was that it was not going to be a fun day at school tomorrow.

I woke up at 6:00 am so I could get ready for school and also get Jenny's coffee, even though she never asked me to get it. I wanted to do it to make it up to her.

I tried my best to get to the coffee shop early so I could get to school early and greet Jenny with her coffee when she arrived. As I stood at her locker, I remembered: her only class today was history, and it didn't start until 10:30.

So, I opened her locker and put her coffee there with a note next to it:

""It might be cold when you get this, but I hope you enjoy it anyway.""

As I went to my class, I felt bad about leaving a cold coffee for Jenny when she deserved a fresh, hot one. But I couldn't do anything about that now. I got to class and tried to focus, but every vibration of my phone sent my thoughts to Jenny. I was waiting for her to text me.

Then, as the clock turned 10:20, I got a message. It was from Jenny!!

""Coffee was cold, not happy :(""

I immediately texted back, ""I'm so sorry. I can go and get you a new one later if you want,"" but I got no response.

After my last class for the day, I went by Jenny's locker, hoping to see her, but she wasn't there, so I started walking home. Just as I put my keys in the door, I got a text from Jenny.

""Get over here, we need to talk.""

Oh shit, she wants to talk about it. I'm not totally screwed. I threw my backpack into the house and ran to the bus so I could get to Jenny's house. I got there 47 minutes after she texted me. It was as quickly as I could have gotten there.

I knocked on the door, and Jenny's mom opened it.

""You're late. Jenny has been waiting for a very long time. She's in her room.""

I walked into the house without saying a word and started walking to Jenny's room. I knocked on the door and waited for her to tell me to come in.

""Come in, I've been waiting forever for you.""

I pushed the door open slowly and stepped inside. Jenny was sitting on her bed, looking at me with an expression I couldn’t quite read. Her arms were crossed, and her lips were slightly pursed. She didn't seem angry, but I could tell she was upset.

""Sit down,"" she said softly, motioning to the chair across from her.

I hesitated for a moment but did as she asked, my heart pounding in my chest. I wasn't sure what she was going to say, but I knew it wasn’t going to be good.

""I’ve been thinking a lot about what happened,"" she began, her voice steady but with a hint of disappointment. ""And honestly, I’m really hurt. I thought I could trust you, but then you went and did something I didn’t expect from you. You knew better.""

My stomach sank as I listened to her words. It was hard to hear, but I knew I deserved it.

""I get that people make mistakes,"" she continued, her eyes meeting mine. ""But it’s what you do after the mistake that matters. And right now, I don’t know if you really understand the impact of what you did.""

I nodded, trying to find the right words, but nothing felt enough. How could I make her understand how sorry I truly was?

Jenny sighed, running a hand through her hair. ""But I’m not just going to shut you out. I don’t want to, but I need you to show me that you can fix this. That you actually care about me, and not just about how you feel.""

She paused, and I waited, unsure what to expect next.

""I have a few ways for you to make it up to me,"" she said, her tone softening. ""But they’re not going to be easy, and I’ll be watching. If you’re serious, you’ll prove it. Are you up for that?""

I didn’t even hesitate. ""Yes. I’ll do whatever it takes, Jenny. I promise.""

She studied me for a moment, her expression unreadable, before giving a small nod. ""Alright. First, you’re going to take responsibility for your actions. You’re going to apologize, but not just with words. You’re going to show me that you understand what you did and how it affected me. That means no more excuses or empty gestures.""

I swallowed hard, knowing that would be the hardest part. I could feel the weight of the promise hanging between us.

""And second,"" she added, ""you’re going to earn my trust back. That means being patient, being consistent, and proving to me that you can be the kind of person I thought you were. And no, I’m not just talking about coffee runs or gifts. I want real actions, and I’ll be watching closely.""

I felt a small sense of relief that she was willing to give me a chance, but I also felt the full weight of the challenge she was putting in front of me.

""I’ll do it, Jenny,"" I said, my voice steady now. ""I’ll prove it to you. You won’t regret giving me this chance.""

She gave a small smile, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. ""We’ll see. I’ll be keeping track, so don’t mess it up. Now, I have a few things you need to do before we can start being us again.""

I nodded eagerly, not even hesitating. ""Of course, Jenny. Anything you need.""

As soon as I said that, a smile crept up on her face. It was subtle, but I could see the change in her demeanor. She knew she had me.

""Good,"" she said, her voice a little lighter now. ""First, I want you to spend some time thinking about what you did. Not just for an hour, but for a while. I want you to really understand why it hurt me, not just because I’m telling you, but because you get it yourself.""

I nodded again, not sure how long she meant by ""a while,"" but I was willing to do whatever it took.

""Second,"" she went on, her gaze sharp but not unkind, ""I want you to apologize to the people I care about. I need to know that you’re ready to show everyone that you're serious about making things right—not just to me, but to the people around me. So my mom is downstairs waiting for you after we are done.""

My heart sank. That was going to be tough. I didn’t think I could avoid it, though. If I was serious about earning her trust, this was part of the deal.

""And lastly,"" she paused, letting the silence stretch between us, ""Have you ever heard about chastity cages?""

Friendly service and great presentation! Although the inside space was smaller than expected and hard to maneuver around. I pleasantly enjoyed my visit. ,41,1740345163.0,austinfood,6,0.92,False

They don't have to be Bluetooth or able to play music. I want to be able to work on an airplane, in a coffee shop, while my husband watches TV, etc but in silence. Preferably under $100. Please tell me what you love and what you hate!

I tried the Tozo HT2, and they didn't do enough. Looking at the Jlab JBuds Lux now. ",3,1740345136.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False
1iwkp2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1iwkp2y/advice_needed/,Advice needed,"Hi friends! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

This is a little long but I hope if you make it to the end and can help I’d be really grateful.

I’m 27, female and a single mom. I live in upstate New York and have a business concept idea that is a first of its kind in this area, with a pretty solid business plan for potential investors. 

My personal credit is trash, due to a period of time when I was at my lowest low, and then got my identity stolen. And my income is minimal, (30k) yearly.

I’ve got over 10 years of experience in the restaurant industry, management and service. My idea is to make a brick and mortar coffee shop, with its own unique twists . I have a location idea, already have an EIN and getting the LLC. My biggest issue is funds. Because I’m a start up and my personal credit makes me unfavorable, I really don’t know where to begin. I’ve tried SBA loans, posting in angel invest sites. I just find more what to do, because the location and idea is one that’s working in thriving markets and have projections on the potential profits for investors and myself. But alas I have nothing, crickets. 

Any advice is really appreciated",2,1740345125.0,smallbusiness,3,1.0,False
1iwkozx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1iwkozx/anyone_else_get_major_fatigue/,Anyone else get major fatigue?,"So I’m a newbie on the Zepbound train. I’m a big dude, always have been. Broad shoulders and a massive frame. I was an offensive lineman in HS football. I’ve been 300+lbs and 6’2” since I was 15 years old. I’m currently just shy of 42yo and at around 315lbs. I just took my 3rd dose of 2.5mg last Friday.

I first noticed major fatigue just after my initial dose. Despite being fat, I am a serious hiker. A day after my initial dose, I went with a friend on a hike we’ve done many times. It’s hard, but not grueling: 12 miles round trip, about 2500’ elevation gain. I started feeling unusually fatigued about 1/3 of the way up. By the 2/3 mark, I was “hitting the wall” pretty hard: having to stop every few minutes, pushing myself forward through the pain by sheer force of will. My whole body felt “tight”. Nevertheless, I completed the hike, and chalked up my fatigue to my body adjusting to the Zep.

I work a manual labor job, and I haven’t noticed any unusual fatigue for the past couple weeks. But most of my job duties are little more than waking on level ground. I might do 10,000+ steps a day, but it’s not strenuous.

Today, I finally got around to doing some yard work I’ve neglected for the past few weeks. Pushing a lawn mower on hilly terrain, some of it steep, through ankle high grass for a couple hours. It honestly kicked my ass. I felt the same fatigue I did when I took the hike. I was having to stop and take breathers. That has never happened to me from mowing my lawn before, even when it’s been this overgrown.

I’m thinking it might have to do with my eating habits. For decades, I’ve had absolutely no appetite for the first half of the day. I generally just have coffee in the morning and don’t eat til mid afternoon. That was what I did the day of the hike. This morning, I did have a few small cookies with my coffee, but no protein or anything substantial. Do I need to change my eating routine? Would forcing myself to eat something in the morning mitigate the fatigue? What I like about Zepbound is that I haven’t had to make any dietary changes; I just naturally eat less. But I’m open to switching things up a bit to avoid future fatigue like this. Anybody have a suggestion?",2,1740345120.0,Zepbound,15,1.0,False

I am looking for my first home machine. I used to work as a barista and I have made thousands of thousands of coffee in my former career. Most of my non barista  friends are using the Breville barista pro. I was really into buying the same one when  one of my office colleagues (im not a barista anymore but we do have la marzocco machine in the office) told me that with my coffee level i need to find more professional machine. I went all over the web and went to some coffee machine shops. I didnt really like the single boiler machines but i did enjoythe hx ones and im thinking getting a lelit mara x. However, now my tiktok is full on of breville videos and it seems like their machines are great too. Question is, will i get a really good espresso and cappuccino from breville machines?

I have the ability to eat an insanely small amount of food with little to no discomfort - I actually prefer it. Can I use this ability to go on 1 week mini cuts every 4 weeks? I go hard at the gym and at bjj so I require the deload week every 4th week regardless as I have a full schedule with 3x BJJ sessions per week and 4x upper/lower split.

\---------------

Hello gents.

I train BJJ 3x per week while doing upper/lower split 4x per week. I spar 20+ rounds per week at BJJ so I put my body under a lot of stress, also this means I am training twice per day twice a week (tuesday and thursday).

I need a deload every 4 weeks. After 3 and a half weeks hitting the weights and sparring, my body is very sore and I need the time off to repair.

So far this is working well. I'm bulking on 3300kcals per day.

I am a bit of an anomaly in terms of appetite. I've accidentally done IF most of my life. I don't have an eating disorder, but my eating is very disordered. I find little pleasure in it and am quite happy to have a coffee in the morning and a 1000kcal dinner. I don't feel hunger generally, when I do it is very muted and I can ignore it.

Can I do a mini cut every 5th week, on my deload week? I didn't eat much at all this week (it was the deload week) and lost around 2kg. This is probably mostly water weight right? I suspect I'll have gained most of that weight back in short order, but my bottom 2 abs are now visible whereas they weren't before so I for sure cut some fat.

Regarding bulking momentum - I understand this is downside to this approach, but I would like you to avoid this in the answer as it brings willpower/habits into the answer and I would like an answer that is physical please.

1iwkhcx,https://i.redd.it/0rrdkl6xdyke1.jpeg,Does this have a name (does it need one)?,"This is based on a London Fog (sort of) but is made with Rooibos and Chamomile.

I sometimes like something sweet after dinner and also avoid caffeine at this time (10pm). I have managed to get my wife hooked on London Fog (she only drinks coffee, or she did...) but I am not the greatest fan of Earl Grey, although I like the fact that Early Grey decaf still tastes like tea!

This is a version that I prefer and have been playing around with until I seem to have settled on a recipe.

I prepare as follows:

1. Place a Chamomile tea bag in a 200ml glass (I have given up on loose chamomile flowers, it's too much of a PITA) underneath a basket filter.

2. Add approx 2.5g of Rooibos to the basket (I say approx because I don't weight it, I use a scoop from baby formula and one scoop of Rooibos weighs about that).

3. Add 100 to 150ml of water at approx. 90 to 95°C and steep for 7 minutes.

4. While steeping, warm milk 2 fingers of milk in tall glass to approx 60° (I cheat and do 30 secs in the microwave for this).

5. Froth the milk using a small battery milk whisk, hopefully timing right so I finish at around the same time as the 7 minutes are up for the steep.

6. Remove basket infuser and teabag from glass. 

7. Add half a teaspoon of honey and 3 drops of vanilla extract to the tea (tisane) and stir until mixed.

8. Pour the tea (tisane) from the small glass into the tall glass, carefully so as not to destroy the froth but moving the pour around so it gives the froth some colour.

Enjoy a sweet but not too sweet beverage that is free if caffeine and helps relax 🙂

1iwkdmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pastors/comments/1iwkdmr/rookie_pastor_looking_for_input_maybe_unwelcome/,"Rookie ""Pastor"" looking for input. Maybe unwelcome.","I've recently started a 'church' called Ductus Exemplo Church and held our first congregation. While I do espouse Christian teachings, my path led me from being homeschooled as a fundamentalist, to going to college and becoming a Jeffersonian Christian, to essentially being an atheist who agrees with general teachings of Christ.

My general principles are fairly straightforward, and seem to be appealing to people. Every faith has fairly straightforward commandments to be generous, to take care of your neighbors, to do good things rather than just talk about them, to feed the hungry, care for the sick, etc. 

We met at a coffee shop, exchanged pleasantries and got coffee, then I spoke for 2-3 minutes just welcoming people and thanking them for joining me in the endeavor while offering a few quotes from the Bible, Qur'an, Dhammapada, Cicero and Will Rogers (lol). We then did a quick paper-scissors-rock tournament for who would pick what we listened to on a bluetooth speaker (it ended up being the Dollop Podcast) I then passed out bags and spears and we walked over to a local courthouse and cleaned out a storm drain ravine that was full of plastic garbage that was washing directly into the Chesapeake Bay. We finished up in just over an hour, the length of 'church' normally, and then looked at pictures of the improvement we created. People were flushed but grinning. Everyone agreed that they would try to bring another person with them next week.

And here's where I would ask for your help, if you would be so gracious to give it to me. I did this on a lark, expecting it to go nowhere and I'd just wear a sweatshirt with my church name on it while I picked up trash around town since I don't drive. Now I've got strangers emailing me after only a few hours. It looks like, at least while people are intrigued, that I will have access to an excessive amount of labor that I will struggle to direct anywhere useful.

Could you please tell me what kinds of things I could do with a few dozen people who want to attend a church that replaces most of the sermons with performing service? For example, I don't know what kinds of things would be in the way of me buying ingredients and providing free food to people. Can we do crazy charity stuff like the Amish building barns, or will zoning and stuff get in the way?

I could really use some direct action ideas if you have them. A major tenet of my church is that we don't deal with money as a faith, so anything involving funding anything with our labor is not viable. Money gets 167 hours of our weeks, faith and service should get 1 to themselves.

Thank you for your time and input, and I'm sorry if this kind of outreach is not useful in this subreddit. I do want to forward much of Christ's teachings even if I do not personally believe in the supernatural. I value them for their wisdom alone.",0,1740344317.0,pastors,9,0.22,False

I stayed single for 6 years, no dates or anything. Was chatting to this girl for 5 years on Instagram and Facebook as friends. I helped her learn better English and she helped me with clothes I was deciding on and other life stuff. She was in a relationship so never crossed that boundary other than me jokingly asking if she was single yet and one day she said actually yes. We spoke on the phone and laughed so much for the next 2 weeks and decided to take the plunge and meet for a coffee. It was literally love at first sight for both of us. For the past 5 months we became best friends and lovers. My life has completely changed. I finally felt safe and wanted and loved and she turned out to be everything I had ever dreamt of in a woman and more. We referred to each other as husband and wife and I thought this was finally it. Finally I've met my soul mate and she did too. 

Out of the blue last week I woke up to a message saying she couldn't do this anymore and it's over. Expected me to just accept it and move on. 

Problem is I have fallen hard for her and I can't just forget her. We've been talking on and off but think she is just trying to be nice.  Saying she's not in the right place at the moment but has been cival. 
 
She's finally agreed to call me in a bit. Naturally I'm happy but also so scared. She won't tell me why she's decided this. 

It's gone from the most amazing thing ever to me feeling sick,not leaving my house after work and just checking my phone hoping for a message saying she has made a mistake.  

I feel so confused. Mates say block her but I can't.  I don't even hold any anger towards her and it was easy to forget exes. But this one I'm so cut up about. I love her unlike anything I've ever known and not only have I lost her as a lover but as a best friend too. 

Do I play it cool and act not bothered, just keep in contact in the hope it will be good or just tell her how I feel. But I feel if I say that at the moment it puts too much pressure on her when she's already dealing with something she won't say.

I would like to meet someone who is open to going into a social setting with no agenda. Let's just go in with the intention of being decent humans and making an honest effort to get to know the person sitting across from us.

I am an adept conversationalist, and I am seeking the same. I do not want to carry the entire conversation and I will not expect you to do it either. Good conversation is like a ballroom dance; both parties must make the effort or the whole thing falls apart.

I'm a mid-late 30s male, tall, in fair shape, and I look decent and kempt enough that you won't feel compelled to pretend you aren't you when you show up. 

I strike a balance between being an open book but not an oversharer. I am socially savvy enough to avoid hot button topics like politics, religion, etc, but I'm comfortable conversing about them calmly and rationally. That said, don't worry; we won't talk about any of them lol.

So what will we talk about? The world is our oyster! Maybe we talk about music or film. Perhaps we wax poetic about the French Renaissance, or which cafe Danish pastry reigns supreme.

Half the fun is discovering what two perfect strangers will talk about when neither has an ulterior motive.

Maybe one of us will dislike the other. That's fine. 
Or maybe we'll shamelessly flirt with each other from across the table. That's fine too. Or we could enjoy each other's company enough to meet again. Let's roll the dice :)",1,1740343438.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

A little context: I typically write romance, so balancing engaging storytelling with delivering accurate and impactful information is a new challenge for me.

Below is a draft scene from one of my stories, where two investigative journalists follow a lead about a woman denied care due to abortion restrictions. I’d appreciate any thoughts on:

* Does the scene draw you in and keep you engaged?
* Is the balance between storytelling and conveying the issue effective?
* Any suggestions on improving the pacing or character dynamics?

Thanks so much for your time—your feedback will help me shape this project into something that resonates with readers while raising awareness about critical issues.

The fluorescent light in The Town Ledger's newsroom had been flickering for twenty minutes when Elliot Grayson's phone buzzed with a message he'd soon wish he'd never received. Dawn hadn't quite broken over the town's tired skyline, and the empty desks around him cast long shadows in the dim light.

""Check County Memorial ER records from last night. Ask about the Martinez case.""

The message vanished as quickly as it appeared—these anonymous tips always did—but its weight settled in his stomach. Fifteen years of journalism had taught Elliot to trust his instincts, and something about this one felt different. Maybe it was the mention of County Memorial, where his mother had died three years ago, or maybe it was the way his hands trembled slightly as he reached for his coffee cup, finding it empty for the third time that morning.

He was still staring at his phone's dark screen when Jo Carter burst through the door, her combat boots squeaking against the linoleum. She carried her camera bag like always, slung across her body like armor, and dropped a paper cup on his desk with the casual familiarity of someone who'd done it a hundred times before.

""You look like hell,"" she said, dark lipstick slightly smudged from what he suspected had been another sleepless night.

""Good morning to you too."" He took a sip and grimaced. ""This is cold.""

""Yeah, well, I got it yesterday."" She perched on the edge of his desk, studying him with the same intensity she reserved for the subjects of her photographs. Her eyes flickered to his slightly open bottom drawer—the one they both pretended didn't contain a bottle of whiskey—but she said nothing. Some mornings were for pretending not to see things.

""What's got you here at dawn?""

He hesitated, and that was enough. Jo's playful demeanor shifted, her shoulders tensing beneath her thrifted denim jacket. She'd gotten too good at reading him lately. It reminded him of how Sarah used to look at him, back when she was a public defender and he still believed they could change things. Before she became DA and they ended up on opposite sides of every story that mattered.

""Another tip?""

He nodded. ""County Memorial. Something about a Martinez case.""

Jo's fingers unconsciously traced the small scar on her wrist—a souvenir from their last hospital investigation when an orderly caught her photographing patient records. She'd escaped, barely, but the story had died. Just like all the others lately.

""The pregnant woman?"" She was already pulling out her phone, its glow highlighting the shadows under her eyes. ""I heard chatter on the scanner last night. Multiple code blues.""

""You were monitoring the scanner again?""

""Some of us actually work nights, old man."" She scrolled through her contacts—each name a carefully cultivated source, each relationship built on trust she didn't give easily. Not anymore. ""I know someone in the ER. Give me an hour.""

""Jo—"" Elliot started, his tone heavy with warning. He remembered the last time she'd said 'give me an hour.' She'd disappeared for three days and returned with a story about forced sterilizations at the women's prison. And a broken rib she never explained.

""What? I'll be careful."" She was already heading for the door but paused, morning light catching her face in a way that made her look younger and older all at once. ""Hey, did you notice the black SUV parked across the street again?""

Elliot's jaw tightened. ""Third time this week.""

""Yeah."" She adjusted her camera strap, but he caught the slight tremor in her hands. They were both scared, though neither would say it. ""Maybe we're finally pissing off the right people.""

She disappeared before he could protest, leaving behind the scent of coffee and cheap shampoo. Elliot pulled out a fresh notepad, writing at the top: ""MARTINEZ - County Memorial - Code Blues?"" Below that, smaller: ""Who's watching?""

Through the window, they examined the black SUV outside. Inside his chest, fear and determination waged their familiar war. The last time he'd ignored a tip like this, a girl died. He still kept her obituary in his desk drawer, next to Sarah's photo and that damn bottle of whiskey.

Not this time.

The fluorescent light sputtered once more, then steadied, as if making up its mind. Outside, the sun was finally rising over Main Street, casting long shadows across a town that held its secrets close. Elliot began to write, not knowing that by sunset, everything would change.

\---

County Memorial Hospital hadn't changed since the last time Jo snuck in with her camera. Same antiseptic smell. Same flickering vending machine in the corner. Same security guard, Paul, who looked the other way if you slipped him yesterday's crossword puzzle with all the answers filled in.

""Rough night?"" she asked, sliding the folded newspaper across his desk. Paul's eyes had the glazed look of a twelve-hour shift, but they sharpened when he saw her.

""You shouldn't be here, Jo."" He took the crossword anyway, tucking it into his jacket. ""They installed new cameras last week. After that story you wrote about the billing fraud.""

""Did they?"" She smiled, but her heart rate picked up. New cameras meant new blind spots to learn. ""I'm just here to visit a friend.""

""Like you were 'just visiting' when you photographed those billing records?"" He leaned forward, voice dropping. ""They fired Monica from reception over that, you know.""

The guilt hit her abruptly. Monica had been her source, though she'd never admit it. Another casualty in the endless war for truth. She pushed the feeling down, storing it with all the others.

""Fourth floor is under restricted access,"" Paul added, not meeting her eyes. ""Extra security up there since last night.""

Jo's pulse quickened. Fourth floor was obstetrics. ""Thanks for the warning.""

She headed for the stairs instead of the elevator, her mind racing. Extra security meant something worth hiding. Her phone buzzed—Elliot checking in. She ignored it. He'd only try to talk her out of whatever she was about to do.

The stairwell door opened to a quiet fourth-floor hallway. Jo pulled her press pass from her bag, looping it around her neck. Sometimes the best way to hide was to look like you belonged. She'd learned that lesson early, growing up mixed-race in a town that liked its categories neat and simple.

A nurse hurried past, papers clutched to her chest. Her scrubs were wrinkled, hair escaping from a messy bun—the look of someone at the end of a nightmare shift. Jo recognized her. Amy Rivera. They'd gone to high school together, before Amy got out, went to nursing school, then somehow ended up back here like they all did.

""Amy?"" 

The nurse startled, nearly dropping her papers. ""Jo? What are you—"" Her eyes darted to the press pass, then down the hall. ""You can't be here.""

""I heard about last night."" Jo kept her voice low, gentle. The voice she used for scared sources. ""The Martinez case.""

Amy's face went pale. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""Yes, you do."" Jo stepped closer. ""Someone died, didn't they?""

""Nobody died."" Amy's hands were shaking. ""But somebody almost did. And somebody should have done something sooner. That's all I can say.""

A door slammed somewhere down the hall. Amy flinched.

""I have to go."" She brushed past Jo, then paused. ""Check the charts at the nurse's station. I'm taking my break now. I won't be back for fifteen minutes.""

Jo watched her disappear around the corner. Fifteen minutes. In her bag, her camera felt heavy.

\---

Jo approached the nurse's station, her boots silent on the polished floor. The unit secretary was gone—probably for the shift change she'd timed her visit around. A stack of charts sat in the intake rack, and her fingers itched for her camera.

The first chart told the story in sterile medical shorthand:

""Rachel Martinez, 28. Premature rupture of membranes at 16 weeks. Fetal cardiac activity present. Patient presented with fever and chills. Watchful waiting protocol initiated per hospital policy.""

Jo's stomach turned as she flipped through the pages. Vital signs tracked in neat columns showed the progression: rising fever, dropping blood pressure, elevated heart rate. A human body in crisis, documented in precise measurements while everyone waited.

Her phone buzzed again. Elliot. She answered this time, keeping her voice low.

""You need to get here,"" she whispered. ""They knew she was getting septic. They just... watched it happen.""

""Who's 'they'?""

""Everyone. The whole system."" Jo photographed another page of vital signs. ""There's a note here from the resident: 'Patient deteriorating. Legal department consulted regarding intervention criteria.'""

Through the phone, she heard Elliot's sharp intake of breath. ""Get out of there. Now. We'll follow up through proper channels.""

""Proper channels?"" Jo hissed. ""Like we did with the prison story? While they destroyed the evidence?""

A sound from the hallway made her freeze. Footsteps approaching.

'I have to go,"" she whispered, ending the call.

She managed three more photos before she heard voices. As she slipped the chart back into place, movement caught her eye. Through the window of Room 412, she saw a woman in a hospital bed. Dark hair splayed across the pillow, skin glistening with fever-sweat. A man—her husband?—gripped her hand, arguing with a doctor in a white coat.

Jo's camera felt heavy in her hands. Sometimes the biggest stories started with the smallest moments—a tip, a whispered warning, a nurse taking a conveniently timed break.

But this story? This one started with a woman named Rachel Martinez, whose baby's heart was still beating while her own body turned against her.

And the doctors stood by, bound by laws that valued that fetal heartbeat over the life of the woman fighting for breath in Room 412.

Share your favorite methods!,"Was hopping around SF trying out coffees and bought a bag or two at each place to stock up on coffees for the next month or so. I’m relatively new to the hobby and I’m always having a bit of trouble dialing in a good recipe for that first pour. With Coffee Rotation’s sampling size, IMO it will be important to not mess it up in that first go. If a quick search online doesn’t show up with a specific recipe for that bag, brand, or style…then I use my go-to baseline recipe as follows:

**Method**: V60 Pour-Over  
- **Recipe**: 15g coffee (medium-fine like table salt), 250g water (190F). Bloom 45s with 50g, spiral pour another 100g, small agitation/shake at 1:30-1:45 or so then slow spiral pour for final 100g. Total brew time ~3:00-3:30.  
- **Why**: It’s the first recipe I learned and it’s easy to remember. I can usually catch the floral/fruity notes I’m looking for in my coffees and then I can mess with temp/water ratios from there on the next few pours. I usually mess with water ratios only unless the temp completely missed the mark.",1,1740342963.0,coffeerotation,0,0.67,False

We have two oceans and we actually use them. In the morning, you can surf on the Pacific. By the evening, you’re chilling in the Caribbean. Try doing that anywhere else using only public transportation. We’ll wait.
2. Our coffee is superior, and so are we. If your morning cup isn’t Costa Rican, you might as well be drinking dirty water. We’ve been perfecting café since forever, and yes, we absolutely judge people who drink instant coffee.
3. Rain is just a free shower. Plans don’t get canceled for aguaceros. Mejenga in the rain? Extra fun. Running to catch the bus in a downpour? Normal. We don’t fear the rainy season, we embrace it. Like Bob Marley once said, *“Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet.”*
4. We can fix anything with some duct tape and a chancleta. Need a quick repair? Any Tico worth his weight in Gallo Pinto can ""MacGyver"" anything. Forgot a bottle opener? A flip-flop will do. Ticos don’t waste time looking for the “right” tool when *cualquier vara* works just fine.
5. Pacha con Jet. If you don't know what I'm talking about then my point is already proven and I can assure you that you are missing out big time.
6. We don’t do short stories, we do full novelas. Ask a Tico a simple question, and you’ll get a detailed saga, complete with backstories, drama, and unexpected plot twists. You asked for directions, now you know how Juancho met his wife.
7. December is for tamales, and if you’re not wrapping them, you’re not eating them. Everyone’s mom makes *the best* tamales, and if you think store-bought ones count, just leave now.
8. We can sleep through the apocalypse. Street dogs barking? White noise. Thunder so loud it shakes the house? Whatever. Neighbors blasting Bad Bunny at 3 AM? Sounds like a bedtime lullaby. Meanwhile, you need a ""sounds of the rainforest"" CD and a box fan to sleep. Good luck when the power goes out.
9. Our Public transportation is an unsolvable mystery to everyone but us and we love it. No schedules, no maps, no logic. But somehow, everyone knows where to stand and exactly when to start running for it. If you can’t figure it out, good luck.
10. We’re the kings of chilling. No matter what, we always find time for cafecito, a good charla, and a little chisme. Meanwhile, you’re stressing over emails and pacing back and forth expecting us to open the store exactly at the suggested opening time posted on the sign outside. Relax bro.

• Plants along the windowsill behind the sofa
• A standing lap in the corner left of the tv
• A large plant also to the left of the TV
• Lamp behind the sofa facing the tv along with art on the wall
• Wall mount the tv, add speaker stands and bring the coffee table in towards the sofa (although for the space it is a large coffee table)

1iwjo9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandme/comments/1iwjo9h/doordash_sketchyness/,Doordash sketchyness?,"Okay, so I feel like this might sound crazy... but I genuinely feel like a doordash driver (or two) were going to try to abduct me. 

I live in the West end and my apartment can be a little hard to find, but to an extent. I've had deliveries always going to the front or asking for direction help... NBD I get it. 

So it was one of the storms we got last week. I ordered food from not that far away and I ordered a coffee... it was snowing so I gave generous tips. 

Sometimes the drivers go around the block or make other stops near by, nbd. But I was keeping an eye on my drivers in case they just left it in the front of the building so I could go get it. This driver parks in the back of a dark parking lot NEAR my apartment. He just sits there for awhile. (Honestly I thought he was just going to eat my food and not delivery it because that's literally happened to me...) but after awhile either I messaged him to see if he needed directions or he called me. 

He didn't really speak English, which is also nbd. I'm patient and try to communicate effectively. He kept telling me he was outside and I tried to offer him directions but he didn't understand me, or so I thought. He hungup and I went out to the front of the building, during the snow storm and just stood out there waiting for him to turn off State st. Sent him pictures of the street and the porch I was on. It wasn't hard to find where I was. He just had to make a left. 

He called again and I was telling him he wasn't at my location and that I sent pictures, he asked if I spoke Spanish and I don't. (He wasn't speaking Spanish) So I used a translator to tell him (in Spanish via text) I was down the street, he wasn't in the right place, that I was outside. Etc.

Finally after that and calling back and forth, he had moved from the dark parking lot behind a group of apartment buildings (night btw) to on State street where he looked parked. So I was like whatever and just walked up a few blocks on to State (in the storm at night) and he was parked with his hazards on in one of the lanes of State... (forgot to mention while on the phone with him he kept speaking to another man he was with in his language)

I call and motion him to come down to where I was (where he could actually pull over) and call him and he tells me I need to go to him (it seems as if the English he knows comes and goes like sometimes he was communicating rather effectively but then would default to not understanding me at some stuff... maybe coincidence) 

I walk to his car. He opens his window and starts talking to me about the weather, apologizing etc. I get weird vibes. There's no one else in his car, there's another car parked closely behind him but off to the side, hard to explain. There's an alley way that he had came from right behind me. I got this weird feel of being watched or like that voice in your brain that tells you something is unsafe. He kept messing with his phone telling me something. He puts my food on his lap like he's stalling, idk why he doesn't just hand it to me. He shows me his phone and wants me to push some buttons? It felt like he was stalling until traffic started moving again... 

He told me to get in his car and we'd go to my address together. That's when I noped tf out. I grabbed my food off his lap through the window and just walked at a fast pace in a zigzag way away from the cat behind him and to the sidewalk so I couldn't be followed by his car. I called my friend in my apartment building that I was on State and (my street) and that I had a sketchy situation with my doordash and wanted to stay on the phone with her in case he follows me.

Got inside everything was OK. So that was my food. My coffee, WAS still on the way from a different driver. I get inside and check my phone and my coffee driver (different driver) was now parked in the SAME parking lot as that other driver. He calls and I answer and it's a different guy but with the same accent and I hang up. I'm pretty sure it was the guy he was parked behind who he was talking to while on the phone with me but who wasn't there when I went to the car. The location of the driver glitched out too because right before I approached the guy on State the coffee driver was on the bridge. I texted that I don't know what him and his friend are up to but I'm not going out there. And he marked it as delivered. 

Idk how it sounds written out in this way. But I really got the feeling like if I was less aware I would've been abducted. I should've reported it, even if I was wrong someone should have been able to verify that. I should've take a picture of his car and the situation... 

I was aware because during COVID I worked at a gas station on 3rd shift. This same scenario happened to me. Some guy comes in and doesn't speak good English but in a way that seems convenient (and I know how that sounds! But it's what it seemed like) he told me he needed me to show him how to pump gas (in the empty parking lot at 3am).. I tell him I'm not allowed to leave the store when I'm by myself. I got the same uneasy feeling but felt guilty about it and wanted to help and he was persistent. 

So I go out there and try to explain it from the door. Then out of nowhere from around the corner came this other guy (who wasn't in this guys car when he arrived) he starts talking to this guy in some language (Maybe Sudanese?) (The guy who just showed up is young) he approaches me and tells me he just doesn't know how to speak English and doesn't know how to pump his gas... that I need to help him.

For some stupid reason I let my guard down. Like I felt like I had seen this younger guy before, like as a customer, the sense of ""familiarity"" gave me a tinges of ""safety""... I still had a knife in my hand in my pocket too because it still felt unsafe. I went over to the pumps where they were standing. The younger guy kept going behind me a bit and then I noticed the big black van idle at one of the driveways like it's ready to pull out. 

So I say sorry can't help and go inside. I probably locked the door and went into the bathroom to text my bf. It was awhile ago. 

That was around the time women were getting followed and beat up in the West End. One of them had come into that gas station the night it happened. I felt that night at the gas station very similar to the other night on State with the Doordasher... 

I've been very hesitant to say anything because what if I'm just being crazy, or what if I'm perceived as ""racist""... but tbh I feel so uneasy about it. Definitely not ordering delivery anytime soon... if ever. I felt like it was important to share in case I'm not wrong. In case anyone else has had sketchy situations like this.",19,1740342526.0,portlandme,8,0.76,False

Clean lines, warm wood tones, and a perfect balance of function and style make it a go-to for home decor lovers. But like any design trend, it keeps evolving. In 2025, mid-century modern isn’t about big changes—it’s about small, thoughtful updates that make it even better.

# More Comfort, More Personality

If you’ve ever thought mid-century modern furniture looked a little too clean and structured, 2025 is your year. Designers are leaning into softer, cozier elements while keeping that signature sleek look.



* **Textures That Feel Like Home** – Expect more bouclé, plush velvet, and soft linen in furniture like the [**Lorena Genuine Leather Sofa**](https://midinmod.com/products/lorena-sectional-sofa-tan-leather-left-facing-chaise?_pos=2&_psq=lorena&_ss=e&_v=1.0). These fabrics add warmth and make a space feel more inviting.
* **Earthy & Soothing Colors** – Bold colors will always have a place in mid-century modern, but now we’re seeing more muted, nature-inspired tones—deep greens, warm browns, and rust shades.
* **Curves Over Sharp Lines** – Straight edges are taking a back seat to rounded designs. Sofas with soft edges, sculptural coffee tables, and curved lounge chairs like the [**Olney Tan Leather Lounge Chai**](https://midinmod.com/products/olney-tan-leather-lounge-chair?_pos=1&_psq=olney&_ss=e&_v=1.0)r are making homes feel more relaxed and inviting.



# Sustainability Meets Mid-Century Modern

Sustainability isn’t just a buzzword anymore—it’s a necessity. In 2025, mid-century modern furniture is becoming even more eco-conscious.



* **Reclaimed & Natural Materials** – More brands are using reclaimed wood, bamboo, and recycled materials, giving classic designs a greener future.
* **Buy Less, Buy Better** – Instead of cheap furniture that won’t last, people are investing in high-quality, timeless pieces—just like the handcrafted selections at Mid in Mod.
* **Vintage Is In** – Mixing vintage and new mid-century modern pieces creates a unique, sustainable home. That 60s leather chair you found? Keep it—it’s still cool.



# Mixing It Up: Mid-Century Modern & More

 

Nobody’s sticking to one style anymore. 2025 is all about blending mid-century modern with other aesthetics:

* **Scandi simplicity** – Minimalist, airy spaces that pair perfectly with mid-century wood tones.
* **Boho warmth** – Layered rugs, woven textures, and soft lighting make structured mid-century furniture feel cozier.
* **A touch of Art Deco** – Geometric patterns and elegant details are adding a little extra flair to classic designs.



# Mid-Century Modern Is Here to Stay

Mid-century modern has always been about timeless design, and 2025 proves that it can evolve while keeping its essence. If you’re looking for pieces that balance style, comfort, and sustainability, check out[ Mid in Mod](https://midinmod.com/)—because great design never goes out of style.

My fiancé and I are moving to the Hampton roads area for his work soon, so we were hoping to get some suggestions! Neither of us have ever been out that way. His job is in Portsmouth if that helps!

Any recommendations of cool places to live? We are both in our 20’s, have two large dogs, so apartment living is out, we LOVE being able to walk to neat stores, coffee shops, restaurants, etc but it’s not a must (as long as it’s bike-able or a short drive), he is super into playing rec sports (ultimate frisbee, soccer, and rugby currently), and I’m pretty artsy. Somewhere safe is important, so I can walk alone, and we are wanting to start a family in the next few years. Also, he grew up on the water in California, so being in areas where water is accessible would be awesome but it’s for sure not mandatory. 

So far, I’ve heard good things about Ghent and Virginia Beach in general but not anything else. We’re coming from DC but we don’t need the area to have a city feel. We’d be super content with a cute, walkable, small town vibe, too. Anywhere within a 30-40 minute radius of Portsmouth is on the table!

Also, we’d appreciate any general suggestions of places to go, things to do, and ways to get involved in the community or just general things you like and dislike about the area!

I have a trip booked for my partner and I to head to Brisbane later this year and I would like to ask her the big question whilst we are there.

As of current, my plan is to duck away from the accomodation solo for a short time with some lame excuse and to leave an envelope for her to find. Eclosed will be cash and a personalised crossword/codeword puzzle with the clues being significant to our relationship e.g. where was our first date etc. The idea is that once completed, the puzzle will reveal a location for her to go get a coffee or snack at a cafe or bar where I will have a table booked and she will receive a second puzzle. I am thinking i could get there beforehand and blutack the envelope under the table or leave it with staff(no cah in this one). I am not sure as of yet to how many puzzles/locations to include. I am considering a potential alternate location to be a florist where I'll have a boquet of flowers waiting with the next puzzle/riddle. However the end goal is for her to rendezvous with me at a dinner or lunch venue that i have arranged for a romantic meal(preferably with a nice view). I plan to be reachable via phone the whole time and not too far away incase she has any issue traversing the streets or puzzles.

Hopefully this will reach locals of brisbane who may be able to suggest potential venues to use as locations.

We have done a few escape roomsd and puzzle challenges together and have thorogly enjoyed them, and we always end up with a few extra puzzle books to bring home everytime we travel.

💕 what i have already::: delonghi stilosa espresso machine, coffee syrups (raspberry, white chocolate, brown sugar cinnamon, slt caramel, bourbon caramel, vanilla, pb cup, hazelnut) and i plan on buying more + sf options because i drink those myself.
id probably buy milk depending on the customers and what they prefer. buying as i go isnt an issue for me.

💕 i also know that i may need a license to do this and i plan on looking into that !! this is all roughly just my brain thinking and im looking for other thoughts!!

my main goal is that my customers wont have to leave their house / work just for a coffee!",1,1740342324.0,barista,1,1.0,False

1iwjkvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1iwjkvx/trying_to_rebuild_a_testimony/,Trying to rebuild a testimony,"I was inactive for about 6 years starting in 2018. My brother served a mission in 2016, had a terrible experience (I won’t get into details, as that is his personal experience and not my information to share), and as a result, my family stopped going to church. Although I didn’t believe anymore, I like to think that I didn’t suddenly become some terrible person. I never tried to bring down the church or anything like that. And my moral philosophy was still always to try and treat others with kindness, regardless of the situation. 

Anyway, I recently started dating a woman who is a very faithful and active member. She has made me incredibly happy, and I want to keep my relationship going with her. However, for obvious reasons, we wouldn’t be able to get married due to the faith difference. I felt it wouldn’t be fair to her to try and get her to change her faith or beliefs. So, I decided I would try and give things another fair and honest shot with the church. I’ve been going to church with her, I’ve been reading my scriptures, and I’ve even stopped drinking coffee (if you knew me before, you’d know how difficult this was for me). I’ve been trying to say my prayers every night and rebuild my relationship with God. However, the problem is that I honestly don’t really feel like I’ve noticed much of a difference in my testimony. I understand that it might take a while for some people, but I’m really struggling to feel like I’m getting anywhere spiritually.

All this to ask, has anyone experienced a similar situation? And if so, do you have any advice? I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or what the deal is. I want to keep trying and keep giving things an honest chance, but if I’m not noticing progress, I don’t know how much longer I’ll be able keep trying. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",9,1740342288.0,latterdaysaints,5,0.91,False

1iwjkf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemonolatryPractices/comments/1iwjkf9/in_regards_to_andrealphus/,In Regards to Andrealphus,"So, I'm just sitting here thinking about my past experiences with Andrealphus. I won't get into them. They're posted in their own posts. But I got to thinking how I would prepare someone or advise someone who wanted to work with him or is new to him. Now, keep in mind, these are just observations from my own experience. If someone else has something they want to add, please, feel free.

Andrealphus is a VERY helpful demon. He's creative, he's been consistent, he seems to enjoy making use of himself and guiding the hands that need him. Really, he's great to work with. I really got a lot out of the experiences.

Andrealphus is also a chaotic pain in the ass. He is very stubborn. If he wants attention, he's going to bug you until he gets it. He's vain. He can be flattered, and he will even use his own vanity as the butt of jokes. He knows what he's doing. Now, just because you try to flatter him, that doesn't seem to weigh any more or less in your favor of getting what you want from him. He just likes to hear how wonderful or beautiful he is. Don't underestimate him. Don't disrespect him. I think that is fair for working ewith any entity.

Listen to the things Andrealphus tells you. For his flaws, he is, as I said, very helpful and, from what I've experienced, LIKES to be helpful. So, listen to his advice and consider his inspirations, respect his power. However, take his commentary with a grain of salt. He's flippantly rude. Not ALL the time, but he has a habit (from my experience) of talking as if he has no filter. He will talk to you like you are beneath him and he is being graceful by putting up with your inconvenient favor. He will very likely say something you don't like. ""I don't like that thing you put on my alter. That dress is nice, but your face could use some work. It's kind of ugly, but it'll do. I'll give you a sticker and hang it on my fridge."" You know...condescending things. DON'T take ANY of it personally. I've tried to figure out what these jabs are.

1. They are just his unfiltered thoughts. He doesn't mean them to be offensive. He just is being honest.

2, These comments mean nothing and calling him out will entertain him. I've done this a few times, and his condescension quickly turned to humor, and he said some pretty nice things.

3. Acknowledge that he says these things but just ignore him or roll your eyes or something. He may just be trying to get a rise out of you. I've found he can be a bit...mischievous in his own way.

So far, nothing he has said to me in his commentary has truly been personal. Like, he tailors it to you, but he doesn't necessarily mean it. I've always taken it as a moment where I'm supposed to push back against him. I could defend myself, roll with it, or playfully make an insult back in banter. All of these have gotten positive results from me. Just remember...respect. You can make a jab back, pick on him a little, but just make sure there's a level of respect and you are trying to play his own game against him. He seemed to like this and would always quickly change his tune.

Even when giving him offerings, listen to what he says if he gives you feedback, but also know it's okay to question his feedback.

A: I don't like this. I think it's the UGLIEST thing I've EVER seen in my entire life. Be gone with it!

P: Do you REALLY hate it, or are you just being overly dramatic?

Andrealphus kinda reminds me of a really pompous cat that needs a Snickers bar. Now, I'm not saying he's bad. I'm just saying that he can be complex, and he may not always be so straightforward. You may have to banter with him, work to get information out of him you want. He won't always make it easy because where's the fun in that, and he usually comes off as enjoying a good bit of fun. Just prepare yourself if you're going to involve yourself with him. He can be a little stinker. You just need to learn how to ""defend"" yourself from his antics if he decides to be obtuse.

OTHER INFO:

I don't know what the books say about what Andrealphus likes or wants. I just know what he's asked for and accepted from me.  So, here's what I've been asked for/have been offering.

Colors: Mint Green, Blue-Green, Dark Blue, Light Blue, White, Gold-Brown, Gray. I think Orange would be okay too.

Scents: Onion, Peppermint, Curry/Cumin, Pine, I THINK Cedar, he seems to like Christmasy scents, so Mulberry, Spiced smells, Gumdrops, Frankincense, probably Myrrh but I've not tried it. He has mentioned he likes the smell of Indian food. I've not been able to offer that.  
  
Flavors: Peppermint, Mint Chocolate, Coffee, Onion Bagels (his particular favorite with me), Bagels in general (he hasn't been too picky. Onion just seems to be his favorite), Gumdrops, Spiced Gummy Candies (think like those spiced orange candies), Chocolate with French Vanilla (not his favorite but he seems to like it anyway. He definitely prefers coffee). I'm assuming he'd love Indian food since he mentioned the smell of it, I think he really liked Blueberries, Peach Schnapps (and probably Peppermint Schnapps), Cranberries. 

Non-Food Things: Peacocks, Pretty Feathers, Birds, Artwork, His Sigil, Space Stuff, Mathematical Tools...still learning what else he might possibly like offered on his altar.

  
That's all I've been able to observe and learn from and about him so far, aside from the fact that he likes music, but no specific genre. He seems to like a bit of everything. Again, this is just what I've gathered from my own experiences with him. This is a discussion thread so, maybe you have different experiences and more personalized lists of things you have offered/he has asked for. So, maybe you'd like to share? Perhaps you could confirm some of the things I've experienced, or where he has been somehow contradictory to this experience with you, or you just have things you could add as advice to anyone who would like to work with Andrealphus. Trust me, I'm no expert, so I'm sure there's lots of stuff that's different than mine.",6,1740342256.0,DemonolatryPractices,0,0.88,False

""Just one more day till Valentine's day, do you have a date for the Lovers Laddurback festival today?"" Rayland sat with his coffee watching the local news man flash his fake teeth wondering where he could get a nice set of viners like that himself.
""Do I have a date?"" Was his next thought, followed by
""Armis."" 
""I could see how Armis is doing, we did have a pretty good time the other night. I'll give her a call!"" With joy he picked up his receiver and gave her a ring.


""Hmm lines…dead? I'll just head over and ask her Iin person I suppose.""  walking over to his coat rack
*Knock knock knock* 
""H-hello? Who's there?"" A meek voice side through the mail slot.
""Um it's me Armis, Hedge. You remember from the other night?"" Rayland responded 
""God my god Hedge I'm so happy to see you!"" She said flinging the door open and jumping on the man. Armis looked shaken, like she had been crying.
""Whoa haha miss me that much huh?"" He said with a smirk, somewhat clueless.
""No! Well I mean yes! But no, I've had a lot of weird things happen since I last saw you and I didn't know where you lived so I couldn't very well come see you. My phone lines been down too so I couldn’t call. I'm just...I'm just so happy you're here."" She explained almost running out of breath.
""Well here let's head inside and you tell me what's been going on."" He said, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder.Heading  inside Rayland tossed his coat on the couch and she made coffee for the two of them.
""So you said the phone lines have been down?"" 
""Well I think that...maybe they were cut?""
""Cut?"" He questioned.
""I know it sounds paranoid but there's no dial tone or anything, see for yourself."" She gestured to the phone on her wall.
Picking up the receiver Rayland held it up to his ear and glanced over at Armis.
""Hmmm how strange, what else has been happening?"" 
""Well I haven't seen my mail man in a few days, I haven't even gotten any mail. The gas station on the corner has been closed, which is weird cause Amillio knows me and I feel like he would tell me if he was closing up shop for a while."" She sat down at her kitchen table and continued.
""I haven't seen any cats or dogs and.."" she paused 
""Hedge I haven't seen any of my neighbors in days."" Staring at Rayland with the look of a woman on the edge of tears.


""Oh darling, hey it's okay. Look I'm sure they're just on, ugh, vacation?"" He tried comforting her.
""No there's no way they're all just gone, I know these people Hedge. I watch their kids for their date nights and gave them a clock for christmas.Tthey wouldn't just leave without saying anything. I tried knocking on their door but no answer, there was just this weird sweet smelling slimy stuff on their door knob that kinda burned when I touched it."" The tears started to flow as she thought of what could've happened to her neighbors.
""I feel like I'm going crazy, I-i know he's gone but all of this is just reminding me of Devlin. It just seems like some shit he would do."" She spoke while trying to rope her emotions back in.
""Look I think you just need to get out, being cooped up in here all day isn't gonna do you any good, let's go get a bite to eat and then maybe we could go to the Festival tomorrow?"" Rayland said, putting his hands on her shoulders.
""I don’t know, maybe you’re right, getting out of her definitely sounds nice, but the festival? I don't even have a Valentine this year."" She sucked up her tears looking up at Rayland.
""Hey silly lady, I'll be your Valentine."" He said with a warm smile on his face as he wiped away her tears.
""Stop, you're gonna make me cry again. Do you really mean it?"" SHe spoke softly’
""Of course I mean it baby."" He leaned in and kissed her soft lips.
It wasn't long till he began working his way down kissing and biting on her neck, working his hands under her shirt to lift it off. Kissing lower onto her chest until he was sucking and licking her nipples.
They spent the rest of the day fucking and talking, eating and fucking some more until night had fallen upon them.
""Wakey wakey sleepy ass!"" Armis greeted Raymond.
""Ass? Isn't it sleepy pants?"" He said, rubbing his eyes.
""Ah who gives a fuck, wake up! I wanna get down to the festival while there's still parking."" She said, pulling her shirt down over her bare breasts.
""What time is it even?"" Rayland said, looking over at the bedside clock in Armis's room. 
""Damn already 10 we really slept in."" He said trying his damnedest to shake himself awake


""Well you did get a pretty good workout in last night."" She said as she ran her fingers through his hair. 
""Haha I think we both did, I don't know where you find the energy. Alright I'm up I'm up."" He said pulling his legs though his pants ""let's get some food and get goin.”


The annual Bostonian Lovers Laddurback Festival, held every year in the Charles River Reservation. Thousands of Bostonians gather with their loved ones to partake in Valentine Day games and food. This year's record highs promised a beautiful February day for all attendees. Armis and Rayland met up with Chelsea, Rayland's secretary and her boyfriend Daniel. The group spent the better half of the afternoon bobbing for apples and participating in three legged races. As the day went on Rayland really found himself falling for Armis, the way her amber eyes shine in the sunlight and her laugh. He absolutely fell in love with her laugh. As evening started to set in, the heart themed rides came to life in a flurry of sound and light.
""The city really went all out this year"" Daniel commented, shoveling pretzels into his mouth.
""I think the Mayor is really just pining for that re-election good will right now."" Rayland responed.
""Well it's workin on me, he's definitely got my vote. I mean come on look at all these rides! They got a tunnel of love, merry go rounds, ugh, look they even got a big swinging one this year!"" Chelsea joined in.
The group looked over to the center of the fair grounds to a huge pendulum ride named ""Red Rocket Heartbreaker"" it consisted of two bright red and yellow rocket shaped canoes swinging back and forth against each other.
""Wow, that's some centerpiece."" Said Daniel
""Can we go in that one next babe? It looks so fun!"" Chelsea asked in a puppy dog voice.
Not wanting to seem scared in front of his lady, Daniel thought quick ""ugh yeah sure, but first let's get some more snacks!"" 
""If we eat too much, maybe she'll get an upset stomach and not want to ride."" he thought.
""Sheesh you freakin pig if you really want, but I'm not getting anything."" She replied thinking ""he's not getting out of this one, not this time.""


""A snack does sound good, a nice big strawberry funnel cake would really hit the spot right now"" Armis interjected.
""You sure you want that before we go on the rides?"" Rayland said scratching his head
""I'm a grown woman I can handle myself!"" Armis challenged.
""Okay if you say so"" he said chuckling.
The group walked on over to the nearest snack stand.
""Okay buddy one Cupid's Arrow strawberry funnel cake with extra sugar!"" She exclaimed to the funnel cake man.
The red and white striped funnel cake man said nothing, he just stood there staring at Armis with a strained look on his face. 
""Did you hear me man?"" She asked, confused.
Nothing. She waved her hand in front of his face but still no response. 
""What the hell man?"" She asked. 
That's when his mouth opened, and a sweet rose scent assaulted Armis, followed by a clear ooze flowing out of his mouth.
""AAAAHHHH WHAT THE FUCK!"" she shouted in fear.
The ooze started flowing out of the man's nose and eyes melting through the bottom of the man's face into his torso until his head collapsed into itself. 
""You cheating bitch!"" A furiously gurgled voice shouted. From the shadows the bloated mass of goo that was Devlin Cupid shot out in an attempt to grab Armis. She found herself flying backwards before Cupid's acidic touch could grasp her, Rayland had a tight grip on her forearm already running in the opposite direction. Cupid burst through the snack stand, his bloated form more ooze than man at this point looked like some enlarged protozoa. A large blob with a human shaped cell in the center. Cupid lurched forward and splattered into Chelsea and Daniel. A wave of goo completely engulfed Chelsea, leaving an expression of total confusion and agony on her melting face. Her body bleeding away into the ooze like cotton candy in water. The skin and muscle on Daniel's arm started to boil away. The man fell to his back crying out in agony as he lifted his half melted arm to his face, muscle fibers stripped away and fingers burned down to nubs.
Cupid began to make a bee line for Armis, consuming all organic matter in his path leaving behind a vile snail trail of gore. 
""Wayland you fucking back stabbing son of a bitch, I'm gonna boil you from the inside out!"" Cupid gurgled out in burps of rage. 
""Do you know that thing?"" Armis cried out.
""No and I don't think it knows me either, I think it said Wayla-"" Rayland stopped mid sentence, he turned the corner and ducked into a nearby funhouse. A flood of rose scented carnage swept by the pair and headed into a crowd of festival goers. Bodies sizzled and popped as they rapidly disintegrated. Transparent ooze shimmered under the red and white festival lights as Cupid tore his way through dozens of shocked bysanders in his search for Armis.
""Armis! Armis! Where are you!"" Cupid roared 
Looking into the vortex of slimy red death Rayland spoke ""There's no way, I-I don't see how this is even possible."" He looked back at Armis grimly. ""Armis, I think that thing is Devlin!""

If anyone is wondering, the city is safe if you have your wits about you and have travelled before. Use the tips that everyone provides and you will be super safe in most areas is my opinion. 

Some highlights for me: 

Hot Air Ballon and tour of the pyramids - totally worth it in my opinion 

Museum of Anthropology - loved the Mayan section and how they tried to replicate it with the outside and the fountain in the front 

Lucha Libre and the drinks before and after at the bar across the street from the Arena Mexico - fun vibe 

walking around the neighbourhoods and parks - fresh OJ every morning from the fruit stands 

biking to Centro - Zocola from Condessa  

Food was amazing - street tacos and empandas - unfortunately wasn't very hungry

He usually undermines my achievements and says my medical school is not that hard because I am doing child's play and he on the other hand will have it harder. He really is a prick. He says ""are u sure ur a girl"" cuz I don't usually wear makeup. He says whoever marries me will suffer a lot and will wish they were dead. Istg I think I despise him or smthg whenever we are in the same area we argue. He makes other people take his side in a problem. I always tell myself whenever I feel like we will start arguing to ""just leave the space"" but i cannot resist the urge to defend my point. I cannot tell my parents cuz it will be a fully blown problem and he said has on his phones a note dedicated to what each person has done to him (u see i think anyone would hate his guts) meaning that if i do end up complaning i will be the one in a bigger problem.

1iwje5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1iwje5a/bone_exposure_and_extreme_gum_loss_w_exposed/,Bone Exposure and Extreme Gum Loss (w/ Exposed Roots) after Root Canal,"I have a gum issue and I need help identifying the cause. I’m really distressed by not knowing how this could happen or how I can prevent it in the future.

Attached are two photos, showing the lingual and buccal sides of the injury. These photos were taken three weeks after the root canal, at an emergency periodontist appointment. They show healing in progress. I first saw the injury one week after the procedure — I never thought to look before then — and the gum loss was more pronounced and there was a lot of inflammation at the site. I’m headed in the right direction, but still at a loss to explain how I got here.

https://preview.redd.it/dg9h3vrv5yke1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5535c6cf188ca436641789279353f616ffb25ac0

https://preview.redd.it/86h6ynwx5yke1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=738a72c0addf40bb624ab0e696e54b4451e914e4

Three weeks ago, I got a root canal on a molar (this molar got a crown about six years ago) and was sent home with a course of amoxicillin to address a tiny infection at the base of the root, visible in a CT scan but not an X-ray. This was my second (of two) root canal, and the first was from this same endodontist, on a different molar. This endo is highly recommended and respected in the area, and I had no complications with my first root canal. 

A week later, I had no reduction in pain and an alarming visual presentation — what looked like extreme recession around and between both the molar and its neighboring premolar, and something yellow-white in the space between the two teeth that maybe was food or dead gum tissue. So, after exactly one week, I returned to my endodontist. He pulled that something out, without any additional pain or it feeling like he was removing live tissue (and without any anesthetic). He suggested it was some food stuck between my teeth. He did not mention exposed bone, though I’m confident the bone was exposed at this point. He sent me away with chlorhexadine gluconate (antiseptic wash) and triamcinolon gel (steroid) and suggested it would heal in two weeks.

I returned for a followup after two weeks and he informed me that I was missing gum tissue — it was not just traumatized…it was gone, and that the jaw bone between the two teeth was exposed. In the attached picture, you can see that gum tissue on the lingual side, between the molar and premolar, is gone; both teeth have several millimeters of root exposed; and the jaw bone between these two teeth is exposed. On the buccal side, picture attached, there is some slight recession on the molar that was not there before the procedure. Prior to this event, the gum on both sides looked just like its more-healthy neighbors. My endodontist says he has never seen this outcome before, and he is unable to assign this injury to the clamp used in the root canal or come up with any explanation for the missing tissue.  

The next day, I saw a periodontist to whom the orthodontist referred me, but who has an excellent online reputation. The perio also had never seen this and was unwilling to blame the clamp, as well. Neither has offered any alternative explanation for the injury: “it’s a mystery.” Other than this issue, I have no periodontal disease and a few issues of mild recession, not near this area; and my regular dentist and new periodontist is very happy with my current oral health and maintenance routine.

My hope is that this was caused by the clamp and that the endo simply doesn’t want the hassle of admitting cause. Because the surrounding tissue is healthy and the bone is not degraded. My perio expects the gum to regrow over the bone in a few weeks and full recovery of gum tissue over a couple of months, but has a contingency plan for a surgical intervention, in which some exposed jaw bone will be removed. 

My best guess — without any supporting input from either dental specialist — is that something in the root canal procedure (I don’t know what type of clamp was used) lacerated the gum across the molar and premolar, down to the roots and sufficient to reduce its attachment to the bone; and that something I did (like normal eating or brushing) in the first few days after the procedure then fully detached the gum tissue from those teeth and the bone in the space between them and squished some of it up into the gap, where it was later removed. 

My fear is that this really wasn’t caused by the clamp, but reflects some other, underlying health condition. Or maybe some supplement I’m taking is making my gum tissue fragile. I’ve included a list of the medications and supplements I regularly take, in case any of those jump out as potential problems.

So, can anyone help identify possible causes of this sudden and dramatic loss of gum tissue, both on the sides and between the teeth? 

Also, if anyone has any tips on how to promote healing, please let me know. :)

Thanks for your help!

1iwjde4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPOinPH/comments/1iwjde4/iqor_dasma_tmobile_postpaid_first_month/,iQor Dasma T-Mobile Postpaid - First Month,"Hi! If you've read my post before, here is an update after a month with iQor Dasma.

  
Day 1 - January 27, 2025

When you arrive sa iQor, the guards will require you to pass a valid ID in exchange for a badge. You can use that badge habang wala pang ID, however, hindi mo pwede makuha yung ID mo hangga't wala ka pang permanent badge. That can take you an entire week. 

  
When it comes to your IDs, you'll have to submit your own photo for it. They will ask you to send a softcopy ng 2x2 picture nyo and they will use that. 

First day ng training is the New Employee Orientation they will discuss about iQor, your benefits and such. (Ask na kayo ng questions at this point kasi you won't have a separate HR talk.)

HMO after 6 months. I'm not sure if they're still saying it's HMO Day 1 sa marketing nila but starting Jan. 2025, lahat ng new hires will have their HMO after 6 months.

The question na ""Ano yung Tier 3 - Specialist position?"" it just means you are higher than a Senior Agent. For T-Mobile, usually Tech Representatives ay Specialists pero there are some Senior Agents na napunta rin sa Tech.

  
Week 1 

So basically and week 1 is the Foundation Skills Training. You guys know this already.

  
Week 2

This is where your PST starts. During the first 2 weeks ng PST nyo, pure discussions lang about T-Mobile. Then phone time will start sa 3rd week. If there's one thing worth noting sa iQor is that we didn't get a chance to do side barging sa agents na nasa prod. We only did 2 call listenings and them boom! Calls.

My tip is to focus especially sa Verification Process, Payment and Payment arrangements during this time kasi when you start taking phone calls, puro payments ang routed calls sa inyo. Even if you're a Tech Rep, you start by taking in Care calls muna. during the ""Step Skills"".

  
Week 3

Discussions on the first half of the shift then phone time for the rest. 

  
Week 4

Discussions as well, sharing na ng best practices, and since nakapag-adjust ka na from taking phone calls, they start challenging you na to become better when you deliver resolution, offering self-service options, pero they're not very strict na matatakot kayo. They're more on the encouraging side.

  
WHAT ARE MY DISLIKES ABOUT IQOR?

1. Sobrang bagal ng elevator. They only have 2 by the way and ang BAGAAAAAL.

2. The training rooms are not maintained, may mga sira ang carpet, may marks ng leak sa ceiling, sirang ceiling, pangit ang PC and chairs, yung carpet nila hindi nililinis,

3. WALANG FREE COFFEE.

4. Aside from the pantry, walang other areas para sa mga agents to stay during breaktime. Unlike sa other companies na maraming couches and all.

5. You share your locker with a partner habang wala pa kayong sariling locker.

6. If you're a passive learner, mataas ang chance that the trainers will focus on you kasi they would think na hindi ka nakakahabol, especially if you have wavemates na very active.

  
Saka na yung likes after 6 months kapag may HMO na ako. HAHA

Anyways, hope you're well. If not, maybe I can cheer you up? Otherwise, great! First things first, I'm a nerd who's looking for a fellow nerd, so if you aren't one, I'm afraid this might not work out. I'm looking for a partner in crime to share adventures with, both IRL and online. Bonus points if you want to rob a bank with me, fly to Bahamas, and 420 together on a tropical hotel beach resort. It'll be a blast!

Some info about me: I'm 33 yrs old and from Sweden, but ethnically Russo-Bengal. I'm 176 cm in height, black hair (tbh more like salt n' peppery), and kind brown eyes. On the heavier side because life really fucked me up for a while, but I've lost a little bit and am working on myself both physically and mentally. That means I also have a lot of empathy for your own life struggles. Neurodivergent (very likely autistic, currently waiting for an evaluation), left leaning politically, a mix between a classic and modern man. Humanist. Very international.

I'm looking to settle down with someone, I've always worn my heart on my sleeve. Gone above and beyond for everyone I've ever cared for, it'd be nice to have some reciprocity, but alas, I was taken for granted before. I'm an introvert and a homebody but don't mind going out once in a while, whether it be something bigger or just a cozy coffee together. I get along best with clingy nerdy introverts, and if you're kind and into cute things I'm sure that'll make it easier to melt my heart.

Some of my interests are:

- PC Gaming (WoW Anniversary/Classic/Retail, Overwatch 2, Risk of Rain 2, Civilization 6, Minecraft, Baldur's Gate 3, and plenty more. Let's find the next cool adventure together)

- Music (Daft Punk, Armin van Buuren, The Cure, Suicideboys, Kendrick Lamar, Pixies, Disarmonia Mundi, and like a billion more)

- TV Shows (Mr. Robot, Battlestar Galactica, Mad Men, The Expanse, Venture Bros., Generation Kill, etc.)

- Movies (too many to list where do I even start?)

- Anime (Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, No Game No Life, Darker than Black, etc. etc. etc.)

- Shopping (anything nice really)

- Traveling (The Caribbean, Japan, Canary Isles, anywhere nice really, let's go somewhere together)

- Coding (Currently switching from a niche field to back-end, but I've always wanted to make a game with someone)


There's more to me than that, but perhaps we can save the rest for conversation? DMs open, so tell me a little bit about yourself and let's go from there. I prefer moving to a different app (guess which one is ideal for streaming movies and gaming?) if we hit it off. Cheers and have a nice day/evening!",1,1740341749.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

by c.w. cobblestone



My face was flushed as I stood before the mirror in the guest bathroom, cringing at how ridiculous I looked in my new maid’s dress, which was the type of uniform worn by motel housekeepers. I hadn’t yet purchased accessories like shoes or a wig, so I put on sneakers over my stockings and attached the white maid’s cap to my head.



Despite my efforts, I didn’t come close to resembling a woman — I looked like a ridiculous middle-aged sissy.



After stalling as long as I dared, I put one foot in front of the other and ventured down the stairway. As soon as I came into view, everyone cracked up, even Brooke, although she caught herself, covered her mouth with her hand, and tried to offer encouragement.



“That’s a nice dress, Mirabella,” she said. “You look like a real maid, just like you always wanted.”



“T-thank you, Miss.”



Mia snorted. “The dress might be nice, but he looks pretty stupid if you ask me.”



“Nobody asked you!” Brooke snapped.



“Alright, you two,” Liz warned before turning to me. “I like the dress, but you need to buy a wig.”



“And those shoes have got to go,” Cody added. “Proper maids wear heels.”



“Yes, Master.”



“I’m thinking five-inch heels would be nice and elegant,” my master said.



“OMG, that’s too high,” Brooke told her dad. “He can’t do housework in five-inch heels.”



“Sure, he can; Jody wore heels and it was never a problem.”



“But won’t that make his feet hurt?”



“Who cares if his feet hurt?” Mia chuckled. 



“Mirabella will be fine,” Liz said. “But he looks dumb without a wig.”



“A little makeup wouldn’t hurt, either,” Brooke offered with a smile.



“That’s a great idea, honey, why don’t you help him after dinner?” Liz asked. “Show him how to do his makeup.”



“Ooh, yeah, that’ll be fun!” Brooke gushed without stopping to consider how I felt about it. I figured she just assumed, since I’d falsely announced that I felt like a woman trapped in a man’s body, that I’d be happy to start wearing makeup. The sweetheart actually thought she was doing me a favor!



“Great.” Liz pointed to her empty plate and sighed. “Now, hurry up with dinner, Mirabella — I’m starving.”



Since my ass was still sore from Cody’s assault a few hours earlier with his cock and belt, I moved gingerly toward the kitchen, which earned a reprimand from Mia.



“Mom said to hurry up, maid — why are you walking so slow?” She snapped her fingers three times. “Let’s go! Move those skinny little legs!”



That got a laugh out of Cody, although he tried to suppress it.



I glanced at Liz, hoping she’d chide her bratty stepdaughter for being so rude, but my wife threw up her hands. “What are you looking at me for? Get dinner, I said!”



“Y-yes, Mistress.”



“He’s not exactly the brightest maid in the world, is he?” Cody asked with a smirk as I scurried away. That cracked everyone up except Brooke, who seemed uncomfortable, although this time she didn’t stick up for me.



Dinner started out normally enough, with me serving helpings of beef stew before taking my spot near the wall, where I stood at attention with my hands folded in front of my apron like Cody had instructed. Every slight movement pushed a puff of air up my skirt, tickling my stockinged legs. I felt self-conscious and utterly embarrassed at how I was dressed, although at first, I thankfully was ignored while everyone dug in.



The evening broke bad when Liz took a bite, gagged, and extracted a bay leaf from her throat.



“What the hell, you left the bay leaf in there!” she screamed. “I almost choked to death!”



While I thought that was an exaggeration, I kept my assessment to myself and apologized with a curtsey. “I’m so sorry, Mistress, I don’t know how that happened.”



“It happened because you’re a goddamn idiot,” Liz shot back with pure venom in her voice. 



“You got that right,” Mia sniffed. 



Cody leaned back in his chair. “You know, this might be a good time to talk about that punishment and reward system I discussed earlier.”



“Ooh, are you gonna punish him, Dad?” Mia asked with her eyes glowing.



“That’s up to your mom.”



“Hell, yes, punish him.” Liz looked at me with disgust. “Hair in the coffee, leaving the damn bay leaf in the stew — you’ve been a really shitty maid so far.”



“I … I’m so sorry, Mistress.”



Mia made a face and mimicked me: “I’m so sorry, Mistress.”



“Stop picking on him!” Brooke yelled. 



“Nobody’s picking on him, honey.” Cody took his oldest daughter by the hand. “I’ve been trying to tell you that this is exactly what Mirabella wants. He needs structure in his life, which includes being punished when he messes up. He told you that himself, didn’t he?”



“I know, it’s just …” Brooke looked at me. “Are you sure this is what you want?”



“Y-yes, Miss,” I fibbed. “Your father is right — I want to be a good maid for you guys, and if I fall short, I need … um, to be corrected.”



“And if you go above and beyond, you should be rewarded, too,” Cody added. “Aunt Sheila had a pretty good system; Jody carried around a little notebook, and if he did something wrong, he had to give himself a check mark. If he did something good, he could erase the check mark. At the end of the week, if he had five check marks, he got punished.”



“How?” Mia pressed. “Whippings?”



Cody shifted in his seat. “We’re not going to do whippings here, not in front of you girls,” he said. “I’m thinking something like maybe withholding food, or corner time. Or maybe even writing out lines.”



Mia giggled. “You mean make him write a thousand times, ‘I promise not to leave the bay leaf in the stew?’” 



“Something like that,” Cody said, regarding me with a twinkle in his eye. “And if he has a good week, and doesn’t get any check marks, he can get rewarded.”



“Well, get yourself a little notebook and put down two check marks,” Liz told me with a scowl. “And you’re lucky I don’t make it five automatically.”



I curtseyed. “Y-yes, Mistress.



With the matter settled, the family moved on to other topics of conversation, ignoring me until someone wanted something. Having snapped her fingers at me earlier without being yelled at by her mom, Mia did it each time she ordered refills, or, on one occasion, when she told me to put more salt in her stew. I thought Brooke or Liz would say something about Mia’s insolence and laziness, but they apparently were getting used to it, and nobody went to bat for me.



I couldn’t help but feel resentment toward Cody as I watched him hold court with the family from his spot at the head of the dinner table. But after a while, the bitterness faded, and I found myself admiring my master for being so much better than me in every conceivable way. 



After standing there for nearly an hour, my back and feet were starting to ache. It had been a long, difficult, emotional day, with Cody ravaging my body and soul, followed by hours of cooking and cleaning. When everyone finally got up from the table, I quickly cleaned up and did the dishes before staggering to the guest room and collapsing on the bed.



After only a minute or so, Brooke knocked on my door. “I’m here to help with your makeup,” she announced.



“Um, sure honey, come in,” I replied, sitting up and rubbing my eyes.



She entered the bedroom carrying a makeup bag and a small mirror and sat on the bed next to me. “We’ll start with foundation,” she said, digging into the container. “We’ll make you beautiful in no time.”



As tired as I was, I appreciated how kindly Brooke was treating me. After being dogged so relentlessly for the past several days, it was nice to have someone on my side. 



After about 10 minutes, Brooke held up the small mirror for me to see her handiwork. I was amazed.



“Wow, that doesn’t even look like me.”



“You look beautiful, Mirabella,” Brooke said with a smile. She gathered her makeup and went back to her room, and I returned to my prone position on the bed, dying to get just a few minutes of sleep.



It wasn’t ten seconds before Mia called: “Maid!”



With a groan, I rolled out of bed and hurried to Mia’s room. 



“You called, Miss?” I asked after knocking on the open door.



She smirked. “Well, well, look at you. Brooke did that?”



“Yes, Miss.”



“Pfft. You look like a two-dollar whore.” She pointed to her empty glass and snapped her fingers. “Now, take care of that.”



I curtseyed and obeyed. After returning from the kitchen and setting the glass of iced tea on her nightstand, I curtseyed yet again. “Will there be anything else, Miss?”



“Did you iron my black blouse like I told you?”



“Yes, Miss.”



“Okay, you can go.”



“Thank you, Miss.”



I exited Mia’s room and fell back in my bed. This time, I was able to rest for about five minutes before Brooke called: “Mirabella?”



I dragged my ass off the mattress again and reported to the oldest of the two girls. She smiled when I knocked.



“Hey, Mirabella, I know I told you I wanted to wear that brown outfit tomorrow, and thanks for ironing it, but I think I changed my mind. Can you make sure my white lace blouse is ready? I’m gonna wear that with my black jeans.”



“Um, of course, Miss.”



I retrieved the garment from her closet and brought it downstairs to the laundry room. It didn’t take long to iron the blouse, and after I put it in Brooke’s closet and was assured that she didn’t need anything else, I limped back to my bedroom and plopped on the bed, completely wiped out.



Just as I was falling asleep, Cody opened my door without knocking and poked his head in the doorway. “There you are. What the hell are you doing?”



“Um, Master, I was …. um, just taking a break for a few minutes.”



“A break?” He scoffed. “Who said you could take a break?”



“I … I …”



“GET YOUR ASS OUT OF BED!” 



I hopped up and stood at attention. 



“I see Brooke helped you with your makeup. You look nice, sissy; wear it like that whenever you’re at home.”



“Thank you, Master, I will.”



“Now, then, what are you doing lounging around in bed? Are you tired, Mirabella?” Cody’s smirk made me bow my head.



“Y-yes, Master.”



“Well, too bad. Maids don’t get breaks around here, not until everyone has gone to bed. So, from now on, either stay busy, or stand in the hallway at attention so you’re ready when anyone needs you to get something.”



My mouth dropped open at his ridiculously unfair rule. He wasn’t happy about that.



“You got a problem, maid?”



“N-no, Master.”



“Nobody said being a maid was easy, Mirabella,” he said, winking at me. “In fact, you’re gonna find it’s quite hard being MY maid. I can be quite demanding; like I told you, I’m an evil, rotten sonofabitch when I want to be. Now, aren’t you lucky we all ended up together like this?”



“Y-yes, Master.”



“Kneel down.”



I complied and he stepped forward so his crotch was an inch from my face. “Kiss.”



With my pulse throbbing, I leaned forward and pecked my master’s cock through his jeans.



He patted my head. “Good sissy. Now, go get your chastity cage.”



I retrieved the box from my closet and handed it to my master, who ripped it open. “Ah, Aunt Sheila always gets the best,” he said, presenting the scary-looking device to me. “Lift up your skirt, sissy.”



I did and he clucked his tongue. “Men’s underwear, Mirabella? Seriously? I didn’t think I needed to tell you to get panties.”



“Sorry, Master. I’ll go shopping tomorrow.”



“You do that. Now, pull down your underwear.”



When I complied, he scoffed. “Damn, Liz wasn’t kidding, was she? That’s a micro penis.” 



Still laughing, he pulled on my dick like he owned it and stuffed it into the cage before locking it and tucking the key in his pocket. “I hope you remember what it felt like to cum, sissy, because you won’t be doing that for quite a long time.”



I shuddered, but replied in the manner I knew my master wanted: “T-hank you, Master.”



“No problem.” He slapped me on the ass, which caused incredible pain, since I was still tender from his earlier beating with the belt. “Now, go stand your ass in the hallway until someone needs you.”



“Yes, Master.”



For the next few hours, with pain radiating throughout my body, I maintained my post, leaving only to fetch Brooke more iced tea, and once when Liz called me downstairs to ask me whether I’d gassed up her SUV, which, thankfully, I had. 



Eventually, I felt the urge to pee. But since Cody had ordered me to stay there unless someone called for me, I squirmed in place, holding it as best I could.



When Brooke left her bedroom and headed toward the upstairs bathroom, she stopped and frowned at me. “Why are you standing there like that?”



“Um, well, your father says I should wait here in case anyone needs anything.”



“Ah, okay. Well, I’m good; I don’t need anything.”



She started to turn away, but I stopped her. “Um, Miss?”



“Yeah, Mirabella?”



“Um, is it okay if I go to the bathroom?”



“Geez, you have to ask to take bathroom breaks, too?”



“I … I’m not sure, Miss. Your father didn’t say … he just said I should wait here until someone needs something.”



“And you’re too scared to leave without permission?”



I bowed my head. “Yes, Miss.”



“And you like being treated like this?”



“Um, yes, Miss.”



She sighed. “Okay, then, go ahead and use the bathroom.”



“T-thank you, Miss.”



I curtseyed and hurried to the tiny half-bathroom I was allowed to use, while Mia headed for the larger upstairs facility. 



After a long, satisfying piss, which I took sitting down since I was still in my maid’s uniform, I returned to my post. Thankfully, the family finally went to bed at about eleven o’clock, and I was able to stumble to my room and hit the sack.



I was miserable and disheartened, but thankfully I fell asleep a few minutes after my head hit the pillow, and I was able to escape into dreamland.

The Native Chocolate Strudel was a little more challenging. I know other people have had great luck with it, so I'm sure it's my technique. Gonna keep trying at it.

Russian wings on the side (funny story how I got those). Fourth pic is my (top to bottom) Military FreeFall Jump master wings, Static line Jump master wings, and MFF basic wings. 

Russian wings (if that’s what they are, it’s what I was told):  I was on embassy duty as a Detachment Commander. I was in Helsinki Finland. My buddy from school got posted in St Petersburg Russia at the same time. He was a 4 hour train ride away. He asked me to come visit so I did. Got my visa in hand and hopped on train with family. Almost immediately I noticed a shadow. He followed us all the way to St Petersburg and followed us back. Anyway, as expected, I got approached by a “friendly” local, who spoke perfect English (WTF 🤣🤣🤣). Anyway, these were gifted to me by a merchant at a Christmas market as I looked at random stuff.

Hey, Empowish community! 👋 Have you ever felt like you're on a treadmill, running full speed, but not going anywhere? 😅 Between our busy schedules and constant distractions, it's easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of life without pausing to genuinely reflect on where we are and where we're headed. Today, let's delve into why self-reflection is an underutilized yet incredibly powerful tool that can transform your personal growth journey! 🚀

Self-reflection is the art of stopping for a moment to look inward, to analyze, and to understand our thoughts, actions, and motivations. This introspection is not just for yoga retreats or new year's resolutions 🧘‍♀️; it's a daily practice that can catalyze profound change. Let's explore some actionable strategies to embrace this practice and unlock your full potential.

1. **Set a Dedicated Time and Space 🕰️**  
To begin with, create a routine for self-reflection. It could be a quiet morning ritual with your favorite coffee ☕ or a calm evening review with a journal in hand 📓. The key is consistency. Allocate even 10-15 minutes daily to connect with yourself. Consider this sacred time a personal meeting with the most important person in your life: you! 💪

2. **Ask the Right Questions ❓**  
Effective self-reflection isn't about replaying past mistakes or overthinking situations. It's about asking constructive questions. For example, ""What did I learn today?"" or ""What can I do differently tomorrow?"" Experience a shift in perspective by asking, ""What am I grateful for today?"" instead of dwelling on what went wrong. Gratitude journaling can transform your mindset and build positivity 🌈.

3. **Use the Power of Visualization 🧠**  
Picture yourself achieving your goals. This technique isn't just about daydreaming; it’s strategic. Imagine the tasks you need to tackle and visualize the steps to create a mental roadmap. Whether it's acing a presentation or forming a healthy habit, visualization helps turn abstract dreams into tangible actions. Remember, if you can see it, you can be it! 🤩

4. **Embrace Your Emotions 🌊**  
Reflect on your emotions without judgment. Understanding emotional triggers and patterns helps in managing reactions positively. Ask yourself, ""Why did I feel this way?"" Awareness of these nuances highlights areas for emotional growth and emotional intelligence, fostering stronger relationships both personally and professionally. Your emotions are your compass—learn to read them! 🔍

5. **Celebrate Small Wins 🎉**  
Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how minor it seems. Did you step out of your comfort zone today? High-five yourself! 🙌 Every little step is a giant leap on your growth journey. Celebrating small victories fuels motivation and keeps you moving forward, one intentional step at a time.

So, fellow dream-chasers, are you ready to integrate self-reflection into your daily routine and unleash its transformative power? 🌟 Let's turn that treadmill into a path of purposeful progress. Share your favorite self-reflection practices, experiences, or questions in the comments below. Let’s lift each other up on this journey of transformation! 🗨️💬

Remember, self-reflection isn't just a tool—it's a beacon. Keep shining, Empowish! 💫",1,1740341521.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False
1iwj9h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetPeeves/comments/1iwj9h0/when_people_constantly_complain_about_things_they/,When people constantly complain about things they can change but don’t even try.,"Clarification: I’m not referring to someone venting a couple times or people who complain but are trying. Same with anyone who complains about things that aren’t within their control to change. Also, I’m not referring to people who are spreading awareness. None of those count.

I get annoyed when people constantly complain about things they can change but don’t even try. After a few complaints, I’m going to give unsolicited advice and encourage you to try. If the next time you vent, you don’t have any updates about trying, I will no longer make myself available as someone you can vent to. 

Examples: You hate your job? Start by creating a resume and applying online. You don’t like your friends? Stop hanging out with them or spend less time with them and try to make new friends. You’re feeling lonely? Try making friends, online or in real life and before trying to date. You think you might have a mental illness? Call your insurance to find a doctor or therapist who’s cheap or try to find resources, like state services near you. You don’t have a lot of money? Stop eating out, buy groceries and make yourself a sandwich for lunch and make coffee at home. You want to save money but you can’t? Make a budget to see your spending habits, try to see what can be removed or if there’s a cheaper alternative. You’re in debt and you can’t pay it off? Check if the debt you have can be settled, consult a professional, or enroll in a debt relief program. You need a service done that you can’t afford? YouTube it and see if you can do it yourself for cheap. You need help? Ask for it from anyone who’s available.

This also applies to people who want to change other’s behavior but can’t and then complain about it. The only person you can control is yourself. Everyone struggles and complains but I’d just rather surround myself with people who try.

I’m not unrealistic or unreasonable, so you might’ve realized that in all my examples, I’m not saying “fix it”. Most of the time, it’s not that easy. I’m encouraging people to  at least try. It’s okay to feel frustrated or even defeated with things that you can change, but that are hard. All of the examples I provided are things that I’ve done to change my life for the better.
