1qskk9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhichGrocer/comments/1qskk9t/whichgrocer_automatically_creates_shopping_lists/,Whichgrocer automatically creates shopping lists for you based on your favourites,"Hey folks,

Got a doozy for you this week.  The favourites page now automatically assigns your favourited products to create a list per store based on on maximum savings.

Here are my monthly favourites to see it in action.  I've selected that I want to shop at Woolies and Coles today. This shows that I should buy most of my items at Woolworths because that's where the most savings are, except for my Moccona coffee which is $11.50 cheaper at Coles.  

  
Don't mind visiting additional stores like Chemist Warehouse and Priceline? Just select them from the filter and those stores are added to the comparison. Adding Chemist Warehouse found savings for Colgate Plax and Swisse Multiboost for further $19.77 in savings!

  
The page is also mobile friendly making it easier to quickly check while you are at the store and you can now tick things off as you pick them up in store.

  
Feel free to post your favourites page here to share how much you have saved with us.

Friday evening, Michele stood in front of the full-length mirror on the inside of her closet door, checking out the final outfit for her date with Johnny.

A small pile of jeans, tops, and sweaters lay abandoned on the floor—none of them quite right. She finally settled on black leather leggings paired with a tunic-length white sweatshirt that slipped off one shoulder, baring just enough skin to feel dangerous in the best way.

Katie had been true to her word. She was long gone by now, probably fifteen minutes into the drive to her parents’ house in Bridgeport.

Michele gave herself one last slow turn in the mirror, then raised a playfully seductive smile. The leggings and off-the-shoulder tunic looked exactly right—sleek, confident, and just suggestive enough to promise what she had in mind for later.

She glanced once more at the rejected clothes, then swept them back into the closet with the pointed toe of her closed-toe high heel. Slipping her bag over her shoulder, she caught her reflection again and teased her fingers through her shoulder-length waves, giving her hair that effortless, just-tousled look she knew would catch the light at Kung Fu Palace. Satisfied, she flashed herself a quick, knowing smile and headed out.

Johnny, on the other hand, kept things simple.

He tugged a tapered navy-blue long-sleeve thermal over his head, the fabric hugging the broad shoulders and narrow waist he’d earned wrestling in high school—and never quite lost. He ran a hand along his jaw, feeling for stubble, then gave it one more quick pass with the electric razor, just in case.

To him, this wasn’t casual. It was a much-anticipated first date.

In the months Michele had been coming into Gus’s between classes, he’d developed a serious crush. It started with the way she always took the same stool, ordered the same black coffee and buttered corn muffin, and handed him her latest poem like it was nothing. It wasn’t nothing to him.

She listened when he talked about old noir films. She laughed at his dumb jokes. She looked at him like he was more than just the guy pouring refills. He’d caught himself memorizing her schedule, timing the coffee pot so it was fresh when she walked in, wondering if she noticed.

Johnny lived in a small two-bedroom walk-up off Whalley Avenue with his roommate Michael, a former wrestling teammate who now made decent money swinging a hammer on construction sites. Michael had already offered to crash at his girlfriend’s place—Go get her, man—but Johnny waved him off. This was just a first date. Dinner at Kung Fu Palace. No pressure. No expectations.

He checked himself in the bathroom mirror one last time—hair still damp from the shower, sleeves pushed to his elbows, jeans clean, boots polished. Good enough. Better than good enough, he hoped.

Grabbing his keys, phone, and wallet, he paused at the door. His heart gave a quick, nervous thud—not stage fright, exactly. The good kind of nerves. The kind that meant this mattered.

He smiled to himself, locked the door, and headed down the stairs into the cool New Haven evening, already counting the minutes until seven.

Johnny arrived ten minutes early.

He gave Kung Fu Palace a quick once-over—the red lanterns swaying above the door, the smell of garlic, ginger, and sizzling oil spilling out every time it opened—then stepped inside. Michele wasn’t there yet. He took a seat in the takeout waiting area, settling onto the vinyl bench beside a small plastic table stacked with bags of lo mein and General Tso’s.

A little girl—five, maybe six—sat next to him, her legs swinging just shy of the floor. Her mother sat on the other side, scrolling through her phone. The girl stared straight at Johnny, completely expressionless, like she was studying something fascinating.

After a long beat, she leaned toward her mother and whispered—loud enough for Johnny to hear—“He’s so cute.”

Her mom glanced up, followed her daughter’s gaze, and gave Johnny a warm, amused smile. “I’ll say he is, sweetie.”

Johnny felt his cheeks heat. He gave them a small, sheepish nod—thanks, but I’m trying to stay cool here. The girl kept staring, now with the faintest smile, like she’d decided he passed inspection.

Just then, the front door swung open, and Michele strolled in.

Johnny stood immediately, placing a hand lightly at the small of her back as he guided her toward the dining area. Over his shoulder, he gave the girl a playful wave. She ducked her head into her mother’s lap.

“What was that about?” Michele asked, amused.

“Nothing much,” Johnny said. “At least not for another fifteen years.”

The manager led them to an empty table in the back and handed them menus. Johnny pulled out Michele’s chair. She smiled as she sat.

No diner noise to hide behind now.

The menus lay unopened for a moment. They both reached for them at the same time, their fingers brushing. Neither pulled away right away.

“You look great,” Johnny said, breaking the silence, his voice coming out a touch breathier than he meant.

Michele felt her cheeks warm, but she met his eyes with a playful smile. “Why, thank you, Johnny. That was a nice thing to say.”

She’d never seen him like this—outside the diner’s fluorescent lights and baggy uniform. No counter between them now. Up close, he was all lean muscle and quiet confidence: sinewy arms from years of wrestling, solid chest beneath the thermal, a chiseled jaw shadowed just enough to make her wonder what it would feel like under her fingers. Strong without trying to show it.

Friends with benefits, she reminded herself. You’re a future valedictorian. He pours coffee. You can have your cake and eat it too.

Moi, the waiter, appeared with a practiced flourish, setting down fried noodles, duck sauce, and hot mustard before filling their water glasses. “Something to drink?”

“Light beer,” Johnny said.

“Vodka cranberry,” Michele added.

Moi nodded and vanished. They studied the menus. Michele ordered chicken and broccoli in brown sauce; Johnny went with chicken chow mein. Moi returned, took the menus, and promised it wouldn’t be long.

Michele leaned back, twirling her straw. “So, I read your review. Jane Palmer’s quite the femme fatale. Takes out her husband and her lover. Pretty scary lady.”

Johnny grinned. “Scary, sure. But Lizabeth Scott gives her that irresistible edge. Dan Duryea never stood a chance.”

“You know,” Michele said, genuinely impressed, “you’re not a bad writer. I actually found myself wanting to watch one of those old movies.”

“Thanks,” Johnny said, surprised and pleased. “Coming from an Ivy League English major, that means a lot.”

Moi arrived with their food—steaming, fragrant, perfectly timed. “Another drink?”

“I’m good,” Johnny said.

“Same,” Michele agreed.

They ate in comfortable silence for a few minutes, chopsticks clicking softly. Michele half-expected him to make a move, but he didn’t—and that restraint only made her want him more.

“So what do you want to do eventually?” she asked. “Construction, like Michael?”

Johnny shook his head. “I’ve got a collection of short stories. There’s a copy editor at the Eagle who knows people at Simon & Schuster. He’s been passing them along. They’re talking about an advance for a novel.”

Michele’s fork froze midair.

“Do you know how hard it is to get published at Simon & Schuster with an Ivy League degree?” she said. “You really think you’ll pull that off with just a high school diploma?”

“I don’t,” Johnny said easily. “Murray does.”

She laughed, half incredulous. “Well, I wouldn’t get your hopes up. I just don’t want to see you disappointed.”

Johnny shrugged. “If it happens, great. If not, I’m no worse off.”

She found herself bored with the conversation—his dream was sweet, but she’d heard enough. She wanted to move things along.

“I think I’m done,” she said, setting down her chopsticks. “How about we head back to my dorm? My roommate’s gone for the weekend.”

Johnny blinked, surprised, then smiled. “I thought we might hit a bar or two.”

Michele leaned in, sliding her hand across the table to cover his. Her hazel eyes locked onto his.

“The moment’s right,” she said softly. “You know what they say—now or never.”

Johnny held her gaze for a long beat, then signaled Moi for the check.

They paid quickly, left a generous tip, and stepped out into the cool New Haven night—heading straight for her dorm.",1,1769908875.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

My favorite Playlist is on. It contains songs ive listened to innumerable times. I dont have to worry that someone is sick of hearing them or that the volume isnt right for them when its perfect for me. Curiously enough Ive noticed that love songs no longer remind me of any particular person. Thats new. Theres always been someone behind a love song for me in my mind. Maybe even same song but different people. Always someone. What does this noticeable difference even mean? Am I done with romance? Is this what healthy is? Idek. 

That sexy red wax seal on the Makers Mark bottle is always my go to at the liquor store. Typically I drink it straight. 3 shots. 2 ice cubes. I felt like being ""fancy"" and bought the vermouth and bittersweet while there. Stopped at the market and grabbed oranges and cherries. A proper Manhattan is now sitting on my coffee table. Are solo toasts like wishes and we shouldn't say them out loud?

Smoking a joint rolled with cannabis my friend grows and treated me with. To continue feeling fancy I had some dying roses I ground in with them. Ive been told it further induces relaxtion. Im not sure if true but the bits of pink petals against the green cannabis was a delightful looking potpourri. Maybe Ill start making blends. Maybe lavender next?

1qskbgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qskbgz/i_have_a_good_amount_of_friends_but_no_one_to/,I have a good amount of friends but no one to spend time with.,"I (18) have loyal and kind friends but when it comes to showing effort for our friendship they don’t go above the bare minimum. I was/am a cave dweller too so I don’t wanna blame them but I have no one to drink coffee or to talk with outside of school. In this winterbreak I tried to organize a hangout, two didn’t answer and one said they weren’t available that day; I asked him when he was available and he didn’t answer and I can’t just force them to answer. Before that we met twice (by my initiative) in a library (by their choice) and sadly their version of ‘hangout’ is solving Calculus for 7 hours straight. \*I hate calculus\* and the last thing I want is to do it in my leisurely time. Like it is okay to balance study and fun but ‘library’ for ‘fun relaxing time’ shouldn’t be the only default option. And when we should be gossiping or talk about dumb stuff all they speak about are universities and exams, that is their only hobby. I am very proud of them for investing in their future but MY GOD if I hear someone swooning over a person named TUDELFT or EINDHOVEN or POLITECHNICO one more time I swear I will fucking invade the Netherlands. Back to the point, I want our friendship to last until the end but (and I find this question very difficult) who will ask about me after we graduate? I know I will call them and ask about their day but unless I do it first they won’t. Not because they don’t like me but because they can’t show the care. They can’t do anything above the bare minimum for friendship. I buy them gifts, bake cookies and overall care to the best of my ability, is one hangout in a two week holiday too much to ask for? I hate the school/holiday friend framework and always tried to avoid it and tried to build mine around true fellowship but now I am kinda doubting everything. I have self isolation issues so having friends you love but realizing you have no one to talk to is really crushing.",1,1769908492.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

My bones rattle. Heat and pressure build around me. Why am I here? Alarms sound. This can’t be right. Images run through my mind. A child, a boy. He lays on a hill, right outside the fence. I was just there. wasn’t I? Air slaps at my helmet as it leaves the cockpit. My body aches…..my body, it aches? Then I’m alive. The pain is abrupt. I gasp as air rushes into my lungs from the breathing apparatus. My mind slowly focuses. I squeeze my fingers and feel the familiar grip of the steering column.  Did I actually breach the blockade? This was suicide, we all knew it. I recall solemn handshakes, a hug, someone's tears on my cheek. The HUD shows red. Instinct leads my hands as I pull back on the stick, and I stabilize. A flash. It’s far away but it’s enormously, impossibly bright. A multi-nuclear detonation. It could only come from one of our three remaining capital ships. Their ships don’t explode, they just……..”ARMED!” The computer interrupts. A hulking black mass peaks over the horizon of the southern hemisphere. Its shields shimmer away. Haptic feedback alerts me that I have a lock. My mouth is dry. I squeeze the trigger and I'm thrown forward into the cockpit dash. The explosion from the weapon leaving the spit tube is incredible, even in zero G. I bite down and taste blood. I watch as the missile, more of an experiment than a weapon, streaks through the darkness leaving an incorporeal borealis in its wake. Darkness creeps to the edge of my vision. My chest is tight, I struggle to breathe.  Did it work? It had to, it must….The boy sits up on the hill. He looks at me and smiles.  

A rooster crows. I yawn and wipe the sleep from my eyes. I throw on my worn grey sweats and walk out to the kitchen. The old farmhouse isn’t much, but we’ve made it our home. I start up a pot of black coffee and pull the pitcher of orange juice from the fridge. For the coffee, I open the cabinet and pull out my old Air Force mug. For the juice, I pick out a plastic cup with dinosaurs on it. It’s one of those cups where the colors change when you pour a hot or cold liquid into it. It’s his favorite. He bought it with tickets he won playing Galaga at the arcade in a different time before the Arrival. I see the blinking light on my message board….it's likely from the Lieutenant. The shelling started shortly after the Arrival, and the attacks, if that's what they are, seem to come at random times and in random places. Populated or strategically important areas have yet to be targeted. We're still not sure of the purpose behind the attacks, but if you believe the the AI news pundits, it could be anything from a cultural greeting to a shock and awe campaign.  There's rumors of escalation, but it’s no matter to me.  My priorities don't align with the Lieutenant's. I was born to fly, and I was arguably one of the best but I wanted to help people, not drop bombs paid for by corporations.  Find another pilot. I pour my coffee and take a long drink, mute to the heat. I squeeze my fingers around the familiar grip of the mug. There's an explosion. I hear a scream….his scream. It’s coming from the hill by the fence at the edge of the farm. I push through the screen door running towards the sound, calling his name. My chest is tight and I struggle to breath as panic sets in. I hop the fence and see him, my Son, safe. He's in the arms of a a tall spindly stranger. There’s a smoking blast crater from an orbital barrage not 30 feet away. The old fence had been completely vaporized. I rush to the man and take the boy into my arms. I embrace my Son, and my mind floods with thoughts of what could have been. What if I had lost Him? I CAN'T lose Him, not after losing Her. It would break me. The tall man looks to me. He has light skin, dark eyes and a wispy blond comb over. He wears a white t-shirt with suspenders housing one of those “support the confederation” pins with the familiar stars and bars. His pants have cargo pockets and are a bit short for his long limbs, and he wears a watch on both wrists, one digital, one analog.  My son and I both shiver with adrenaline. My mouth is dry. I look to the man and raise my hand in thanks, “you saved Him, my Son, how can I ever thank you?” He grips and shakes my hand as his mouth curls into a light smile. His eyes seem to be looking through me. He speaks, his voice, barely a whisper, his accent nondescript. “I am glad I was here. What a special boy you have. A Father's purpose is to protect his children. He's lucky to have you. Don’t let him out of your sight.” I feel a far off heat, a pressure at my temples. The sensation quickly passes. The man walks back to his truck, waves, and drives off down the road. I carry my Son to the house. His heart beat begins to slow, but he squeezes my hand with all his strength. We walk through the screen door. I set him down on the worn sofa and hand him his dinosaur cup. He takes a long swig of juice and the dinosaurs slowly turn dark red and disappear as the juice, now warm, runs over them. I look for my coffee and realize I knocked the old Air Force mug off the table where it shattered on the wooden floorboards. I sweep up the pieces and throw the refuse into the garbage. I tussle His hair, and give His stomach a poke. He doesn’t react, so I give him one more poke for good measure until I see the hint of a smile. I tell Him I love Him. He stands up in his chair and we embrace. I feel his tears on my cheek. We’ve both lost so much, but we still have each other. I’d been saving some bacon in the icebox. We thawed the bacon and made breakfast sandwiches with eggs from the chicken coop. After breakfast, my Son was back to his old self. Kids are resilient. He’ll likely remember the bacon more than the tall man that pulled him from harms way. But I won’t forget. I walked to the blinking message screen and cleared the notifications. It’s not my problem. I take the last bite of my sandwich. I wipe my mouth and see red on the napkin. I must have bit my tongue, but there is no pain.",1,1769908492.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

My name is M, just the letter, I, 22F and my girlfriend 23F have been going through a really hard time and it’s making me question a few things. Our relationship is incredibly recent, in fact, we’re just shy of our ’six months’, but she has already developed a significant attachment to me that is rather..daunting. The first month and a half was really good, until we had our first real argument about spending too much money on me. Yes, a coffee here and there is really sweet, but I NEVER asked her to spend 600$, if not more, on me. Actually, while we were at the store and she suggested buying it for me I profusely refused. When she did it anyways, I was really uncomfortable but got over it; just for her to repeatedly bring up the fact that people think she deserves better than me. Mind you, we are both young students who are BROKE so this was incredibly irresponsible. Of course I appreciate the gesture but it was far too much and she already knew how uncomfortable I was with people spending money on me in general. We then resolved this, but then she began making insulting remarks calling me things like kind of dumb, not funny, and putting me down under the mask of a joke. I have told her that this is making me feel really bad about myself, she agrees, gets better for a few days and then goes back to normal. Unfortunately, this was just the beginning of our spiral into a very unhealthy addiction (that’s how I’m beginning to feel at least). Arguments continued to occur, some particular fights I recall were ones involving the fact that she was jealous of my cat. YES, my baby, my fur child, she was jealous of my cat, still is. I simply stated that I would choose my cat over her, and our relationship that was roughly 2 months old at the time. Forgive me for choosing my precious baby over someone I hardly know. I have also told my girlfriend that I am not looking for a future wife, I’m simply exploring and want to see where this goes, she has not understood this. From our very first conversation, I made it clear that I was still in school, I wanted love and not necessarily a life partner. She had agreed to this, saying she saw the same way but then revealed later that this was not the case, she also lied about many other views we had ‘shared’. Some of these things were on school, priorities, family, etc. I honestly was beginning to feel like she was lying to me simply because she wanted a relationship and not because she wanted me. I kept dating her, obviously since I’m still with her, but she always seemed to improve before getting worse. At the same time, her mental health started becoming worse and I didn’t want to threaten her mental state. However, it eventually got to the point where it got so bad that I needed to end things with her for my own sake; and I tried to no avail. I won‘t say what happened in particular as it is still quite fresh and personal, but it was certainly a life changing affair that came off as manipulative rather than something else. I was now growing completely miserable, dreading waking up knowing I was with her because I kept feeling like I couldn’t leave. I watched her text her ex-talking stage right in front of me, claiming it was her friend while they talked constantly, allowing her to put me down and get into fights with me because I’m not doing enough, but all I’m trying to do is be as helpful as possible. It’s just too much. She has also been getting very intense about not wanting me to go out drinking or to bars with friends and not invite her. She does not believe that I can have a life outside of her, I say this because she has practically said that before, but it is perfectly acceptable for her to text someone constantly who she was romantically interested. Today was our latest fight, I asked for a bit of space to do some of my own stuff for a while because otherwise she will spam me. She said okay before I went off to do my own thing for 4-5 ish hours before texting me very upset. She is angry, claiming I treat her poorly after taking space that she agreed to. I could maybe understand this more if I knew there wasn’t a double standard, if I did any of the things that she does to me I would be evil for it. I am drained, emotionally and physically and no longer know what to do. I think at this point I’m just looking for some advice about what to do, I love her but I don’t think I can do this anymore.

1qsk5x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qsk5x2/i_saw_something_on_the_moon_and_now_theyre_here/,"I saw something on the Moon, and now they're here to get me [Part 1]","I know what I saw.

I’m not some deranged lunatic who uploads conspiracy theories for momentary attention. I won’t say much, but I’m an astronomer with access to equipment to back up my claims and years of experience in the field. I’ve never seen anything like this.

Looking at the Moon always calmed me down. That huge flying chunk of land that got separated from our planet some 4.5 billion years ago. I won’t say this is a particularly tiring occupation, but it sure is demanding, so staring out at the complete emptiness of the space around us is somewhat… soothing? A gentle reminder of how minute any of our problems are compared to the grand scheme of things.

I sincerely regret looking at the Moon that day. When I first noticed it, I was alone, way past the closing hour of the observatory. Looking at it, I was certain it was some kind of low-orbiting satellite or simply dust on the lens of the telescope, though the latter was unlikely.

I stopped looking through the lens and rubbed my eyes, hoping that what I was clearly witnessing was just a product of my imagination. Sure enough, when I looked back, it wasn’t. 

I saw huge clouds of dust slowly rising from the surface of the Moon, trailing behind something. It was as if someone was running on the surface of the moon at speeds so impossible, it made my skin crawl. It took 20 minutes to create a ring of dust around the moon.

For context, if something were to hypothetically sprint at that speed, it would’ve been flung into deep space by centrifugal force. But it didn’t. Not only was it running, but it defied gravity. It was pinned on the surface by something other than weight. Something I cannot begin to explain.

Due to Earth’s atmosphere, looking through a telescope is as if you’re looking through boiling water. The sheer impossibility of me being able to see the event so clearly made me step away from the telescope entirely and essentially fall on the chair behind me. Whatever that was, it was negating atmospheric distortion.

Now, I’m not one to believe in ghosts or get scared easily, but when the door knocked, I must admit my heart skipped a beat.

“You still in there?” the voice asked. It was my co-worker, whose name I’m leaving out.

I rushed towards the door and opened it. There was something calming about seeing another human being. I grabbed his hand and effectively threw him at the telescope.

“Take a look at this! I cannot believe my fucking eyes!”

“Jeez man, alright I’ll che-”

His words were cut short.

“What…” he exclaimed as he zoomed in.

“I don’t know.”

”Did it get hit by an asteroid? What… what is that?”

I explained to him what I saw briefly. In disbelief, he headed towards the whiteboard. I know that everything is easier when digitized, but there’s something nostalgic about writing on paper or boards. Can’t quite get over it.

He began writing and explaining as he did.

“To circle the moon in 20 minutes, the “thing” is moving at around 9 kilometers per second. Anything above around 2.3 kilometers per second is enough to make whatever that is get launched into space like a catapult.”

”I know. I am aware of the impossibility, but what else could it have been?”

”I… I don’t know. Listen. It’s late, let’s head home, and we can analyze this tomorrow. I’ll drop you off.”

Every fiber of my being wanted to stay there and investigate further, but I reluctantly agreed. I needed rest.

The drive back home was exactly what I needed to calm my nerves a bit. We talked about mundane topics, laughing at trivial details, until he dropped me off.

“Go to sleep, leave this be,” he pleaded. He knew me too well.

I entered my small apartment and threw my keys on the couch. As I was washing my hands, a cruel, unwanted thought crossed my mind. That ring of dust was enough to cause a lunar eclipse. The Moon should, in theory, look like Saturn right now to the naked eye.

I rushed toward my living room window and opened the curtains wide. What I saw shook me to my very core. The Moon was normal. Cruelly, impossibly untouched. I closed the curtains in disbelief. I would make a report to my boss. He’s an old-fashioned guy, so he always appreciated me actually writing on paper.

I wrote that report as if I were an author polishing their life’s work. I described everything I saw, the sheer unlikelihood of it, the terrifying event that my co-worker and I witnessed with our own eyes.

I stretched and let out a grunt. I turned my head 90 degrees in both directions to release any tension. Something was there. Behind my closed curtains, someone was staring at me. I could see the starkly silhouetted shape of a bald head. Like some mortifying shadow play projected against the fabric.

I jumped up and ran toward that same window. I opened the curtains, and was met with the familiar view of my backyard. Nothing was there. I steadied my breathing and slowly headed back to the couch.

“You’re a grown man,” I remember telling myself.

When I looked back at my report, I screamed. I didn’t know what the appropriate reaction was, but that was my response. My report had been altered. I didn’t have time to read it all, but my description of the event was gone. It was entirely replaced with an observation I presumably made regarding an asteroid. It looked like it could have been my report. It was an uncanny resemblance, except for a tiny, chilling difference.

The slant of the writing resembled that of a right-handed person.

I am left-handed.

I didn’t even have time to process what I was watching when I saw another paper on the coffee table, next to my report. It was a drawing. 

From the perspective of my window, looking towards the living room. A figure that resembled me was sitting on the couch, staring at the viewer.

I felt my blood turn cold. My heart was beating against my forehead and ears at speeds I’ve never felt before, and my whole body started trembling. It was as if someone was suffocating me. I desperately tried to breathe while my hand reached my pocket. I dialed the number.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

”Someone… is in my house,” I remember whispering.

“Calm down, sir, what’s your address?” the woman replied, to which I answered immediately.

”We are on our way. While we’re arriving, please try to exit the building. I know it seems scary, but it’s for your safety.”

She was right. I wanted to get out of that god damn house. I couldn’t stay inside when someone else was possibly is there with me. As I stood up and headed for the door, I felt it.

I know that what I’m about to describe seems impossible, but please, you have to believe me. A cold hand grabbed my ankle. My stomach turned as my eyes met the floor. It was a purely white being. Snow white, with no distinctive features. It had no eyes, mouth, or nose. Its hand was gripping my leg so hard I felt like it would break.

It left behind this weird, gooey liquid that smelled of ammonia, which suggested it crawled all the way to me when it watched me leave. I let out a loud scream and started kicking it, maniacally trying to get it off me. It didn’t even react. Its grip was so impossibly strong that I was petrified of running away, since there was a chance my right leg would’ve stayed behind with it.

There was more. From the door frame of the hallway, I could see a similar figure slowly heading towards me. Its frame was skeletal, its limbs impossibly thin, and its head was shifting uncontrollably to disgusting angles.

I was surrounded. Another one emerged from under my couch, one more from behind the kitchen island. What the fuck was going on? The last thing I remember was one of the reaching me, and tracing my face with its sharp, cold finger.

The bottom half of its face started transforming into an expanding black hole of nothingness, a mouth that looked like a robot’s best attempt at appearing human. 

And the sound. Oh, God, the sound. This high-pitched screech that sounded like a microphone was too close to the speaker, which made me feel like my eardrums were about to explode vibrating my very skull and bringing tears to my eyes.

The hole was large enough to fit me whole, and that’s when I heard the door burst open. As I was passing out, I heard police officers shout, and the light from their flashlights flooded every surface. 

The beings got on all fours and disappeared from my line of sight at speeds so high, my stomach twists even thinking about it.

I woke up at the hospital around two days later. The police officers questioned me, but I didn’t tell them what happened. There was no way they would’ve believed me. 

They told me that there was a break-in, and that the culprit hit me with a blunt object on the head before fleeing the scene. Nothing was stolen. They said the investigation was ongoing, and it was best for me to remain hospitalized. 

They also briefly mentioned that the liquid that stained the floors could be an industrial cleaner the perpetrator used to hide their fingerprints, but that did nothing to explain why it left no chemical burns when the “cleaner” gripped my ankle. They didn’t elaborate even when I asked them, which I found weird.

I know it’s pretty unlikely that you’ll believe me, but even if one person does, please, help me.

I’ll update when I get in better shape.

EDIT: I swear I see something staring at me through the door at night. Please help me. Please, someone, anyone, tell me what to do.",2,1769908094.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

If I complain about my loneliness, she throws her situation in my face. She says I should get a divorce, but she doesn't want to because of the house.

Then, a coworker whose father is elderly and needs care, and this coworker is dying to travel and keeps insisting I do it. Honestly, I don't feel like traveling anywhere. It stresses me out to have everything on my plate and no support. And I've already been through that stage with my parents (mine died a long time ago).

And finally, a coworker mentioned that her salary isn't enough. And I'm keeping quiet. I'm not in her situation. She hired an anonymous donor to have a child without a father, and reality is hitting her hard. She's overwhelmed.

Well, those are the opportunity costs. I chose this life of solitude, and like everything, it has its pros and cons. I'm convinced that having children is for people with financial resources because they represent a huge expense in every sense (time, costs).

Anyway, today I woke up at 2 pm, ordered coffee for delivery, and was very relaxed at home.

Has anyone else been envied for their solitude and independence?

PS: I forgot to mention that when I get sick, I take the necessary medical leave days, even if they dock my pay, because my health is my priority, and I don't have to support anyone.",35,1769908082.0,LivingAlone,16,0.97,False

It’s just too much. She has also been getting very intense about not wanting me to go out drinking or to bars with friends and not invite her. She does not believe that I can have a life outside of her, I say this because she has practically said that before, but it is perfectly acceptable for her to text someone constantly who she was romantically interested. Today was our latest fight, I asked for a bit of space to do some of my own stuff for a while because otherwise she will spam me. She said okay before I went off to do my own thing for 4-5 ish hours before texting me very upset. She is angry, claiming I treat her poorly after taking space that she agreed to. I could maybe understand this more if I knew there wasn’t a double standard, if I did any of the things that she does to me I would be evil for it. I am drained, emotionally and physically and no longer know what to do. I think at this point I’m just looking for some advice about what to do, I love her but I don’t think I can do this anymore. What do I say to her?",1,1769908071.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I live in a small apartment building. Three floors. Maybe 12 units. Pretty quiet place. Mostly people who keep to themselves.

There’s an older guy across the hall from me. His name is Ron. Nice enough. Always polite. Smells like coffee and cigarettes. Wears the same brown jacket every day.

We barely talk.

Just “hey” in the hallway.

A few months ago he stopped me one morning and said,

“Hey, thanks again for helping me last night.”

I laughed and said, “For what?”

He looked confused.

“For bringing my groceries in. It was snowing pretty bad.”

I hadn’t done that.

I told him that.

He just frowned and said, “Yeah you did. Around 10. You knocked and asked if I needed help.”

I figured he mixed me up with someone else.

Whatever.

Then it happened again.

Two weeks later:

“Appreciate you fixing my TV. Saved me calling my son.”

I hadn’t been in his apartment.

Ever.

Another time:

“Thanks for sitting with me when I was sick. That meant a lot.”

That one made me uncomfortable.

I was out of town that weekend.

I checked.

I had receipts.

I started paying attention after that.

Every time he thanked me, he described “me” perfectly.

My height.

My voice.

My jacket.

Even my boots.

Said I always came by late.

Between 9 and 11pm.

Always knocked.

Always helped.

Always left quickly.

But I was never there.

Last week I finally asked him straight up.

“Ron… are you sure it’s me?”

He looked hurt.

“Of course it’s you. You live right there.”

He pointed at my door.

Then he added:

“You don’t remember?”

“No,” I said.

He went quiet.

Then said something that made my stomach drop.

“You’ve been coming by for years.”

I’ve only lived here eight months.

That night I couldn’t sleep.

I kept thinking about it.

About someone who looks and sounds like me walking into his place.

So yesterday I stayed up late.

Lights off.

Sat quietly by my door.

At 9:42pm…

I heard knocking.

Not on my door.

On his.

Slow.

Three taps.

I held my breath.

I heard his door open.

And then…

A voice.

My voice.

Muffled through the wall.

Saying:

“Hey Ron. You need anything tonight?”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

Didn’t make a sound.

Ten minutes later, footsteps.

Someone walked past my door.

Stopped.

Stood there.

Then walked away.

This morning Ron thanked me for “checking in again.”

I’m looking for a new place.

You were in the 17-20 years old range, I would think. You stood in front of him and asked if he wanted something to eat or drink. He asked if he could have a coffee. You invited him inside to get what he wanted. 

I want you to know that kindness was noticed. And that it was so inspiring that later that night, on a trip to Dollarama, I witnessed another man sitting in the cold with a cup in hand. Because of you, I asked him if he wanted something to eat or drink. He said, ""Man, anything would be good. Minute rice, noodles anything."" I bought him a few items, and he was so appreciative. 

So thank you for reminding me to be kind and generous. I'm not in a position to be terribly generous, but it was the dollar store and I maybe spent $7 on this guy. 

I've watched people sitting outside with a cup in hand being spit on and sworn at. Do better. Be kinder. It costs nothing to be nice and only $1 for a cup of noodles.

1qsjyi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexualdating/comments/1qsjyi7/m26_m4a_southern_california_looking_for_cool/,"M26 M4A Southern California, looking for cool creative/intellectual people","Hey! 

I’m making this post looking for creative ace people to connect with, and I’m open to friendships or a relationship. I got out of a long-term relationship last year and I’m looking to put myself out there again and make a meaningful connection with someone new. I’ve met cool people through here before, so I figured I’d give it another shot.

My name is Low. I’m 26M, I’m a visual artist, and I’m demisexual. I live in Southern California. I’m an Aquarius and INFP. I’m very left-wing/anti-capitalist politically. I’m very passionate and vocal about human rights, queer rights, housing/public transit reform, urban planning, anti-fascism, anti-imperialism, etc. In terms of my other hobbies and interests, I devote quite a bit of time and attention to: art history, world cinema, photography, making mixed media art, CRPGs/JRPGs, all sorts of alternative rock/pop subgenres (hyperpop, shoegaze, post-punk, etc.), post-modern/sci-fi and experimental literature, collecting physical media, animation, creative writing, comics/graphic novels, and generally all things experimental and creative. I’m very passionate about surreal, expressionistic art. My favorite mediums to work with are ink, acrylic, and oil pastel but I tend to dabble in a little bit of everything. With all of that being said, I’m not exclusively some stuffy pretentious art guy. I’m open-minded and I love hearing about anything and everything that people are passionate about. I have a job working in marketing and graphic design, and I’m in my last semester finishing up my bachelor’s degree. I have a very deadpan, absurdist sense of humor. I really love animals, especially cats. I’m quite a big fan of cutesy, silly cartoon/comic characters like Chiikawa or Pompompurin as well. I’m a big foodie and a heavy coffee/tea drinker. I love going to concerts/shows. I don’t drink, smoke, or do any sort of drugs. I’m also a big fan of going out to thrift stores, bookstores, libraries, museums, and taking little day trips on the train all over Southern California. 

In terms of what I’m looking for, I’m really drawn to people who are passionate about the arts/creativity (especially the weird, conceptual, experimental side of things). I’d really like to have a deep intellectual and emotional connection with someone who cares about the breadth and depth of art/culture as much as I do. If you’re passionate about history, literature, films, music, making art, and human creative expression; then we’ll probably get along quite well. I’m looking to take things slow and build a really meaningful and deep connection. I’d really like to have a long-term best friend, someone to spend quality time with consistently and build a life with. I’m a big fan of spending time teaching each other about our individual interests as well as doing things like parallel play or playing video games or watching films together. I’m open to the idea of having a kid in the future, but it’s not something I feel strongly about one way or the other. I’d prefer if you’re located in California (especially SoCal) but I’m not opposed to LDR (in North America) if there’s a connection. I’m demisexual but I’m mildly sex-repulsed, so I’m open to a sexual relationship with the right person once we’ve established a deep emotional connection but it’s not a necessity. I’m otherwise very physically and emotionally affectionate, and I really value empathy and consistent communication. I’m typically more attracted to femme or non-binary people but I have been attracted to masc people before as well. I’m happy to be friends with anyone, regardless of location or gender. My preferred age range would be between 21-30. 

Lastly, if you’re curious about what I look like or my general vibe. I’m 5’10, I’m sorta alternative and I dress a bit like a grungy hippie bum, I’m white, I have long shaggy brownish-blonde hair, I usually either have a short full beard or a mustache, and I’ve got a chubby/dad bod physique (though I’ve been working hard to lose weight and get into better shape recently). I have been regularly compared to Jesus, young Jeff Bridges, and Norman Reedus if you want a loose point of reference. I’m happy to share pictures of myself once we’ve talked and gotten to know each other a bit. 

Anyways, if you’ve read all of this then I appreciate you! I apologize for this being such a long post. If you’d like to get to know each other, feel free to send me a message and tell me a bit about yourself. I’d love to hear about you and your hobbies/interests, favorite filmmakers/artists, or anything else you feel like sharing. I’d ideally like to move to another platform like Discord or Instagram eventually if we get along with each other. Thanks!",3,1769907566.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

This started as an abandoned interior — peeling walls, dust, decay, no function.

Using ImagineArt Interior Studio, I explored how the same space could become two different café concepts:

* A cozy modern café — warm materials, soft lighting, welcoming atmosphere
* A modern industrial café — raw textures, clean lines, urban character

Workflow:

1. Upload the abandoned space as reference
2. Select the room type (café) to guide structure
3. Use custom prompts to define mood, materials, and function

[Prompt: Transform this abandoned interior space into a cozy modern café while preserving the original architectural structure. Clean and repair the cracked concrete floor into polished concrete with a warm tone. Restore the walls with textured plaster in soft beige and warm gray, keeping subtle traces of the original industrial character. Add warm wooden furniture, a wooden coffee counter, small round tables, and comfortable seating. Introduce warm ambient lighting using pendant lamps, wall lights, and soft indirect lighting. Add indoor plants, minimal wall art, and natural materials to create a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. Cozy, intimate café interior, warm color palette, realistic materials, soft shadows, lifestyle café photography style.](https://preview.redd.it/bt4oq8cn7sgg1.jpeg?width=1376&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2e3776230bf3267814c6e0c35dce203696afe63)

.

[Prompt: Renovate this abandoned space into a modern industrial café with a clean and contemporary aesthetic. Retain the raw industrial character by exposing brick walls, concrete textures, and structural elements, while refining them into a polished design. Add a minimalist café counter, sleek furniture in wood and black metal, and simple geometric seating. Use controlled lighting with track lights, linear LEDs, and focused accent lighting to create contrast and depth. Neutral color palette with warm highlights, uncluttered layout, modern urban café atmosphere, realistic textures, architectural interior photography style.](https://preview.redd.it/sh2ov4ep7sgg1.jpeg?width=1376&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e6e78cfd2144aa3f711f83b519fa8c285c9ab2c)

Same structure.  
Same bones.  
Two very different futures.

Can you believe we're already staring down Pokémon's **30th anniversary**? February 27 marks three decades since those original games dropped in Japan, and to kick things off early, I snagged the **Pokémon Day 2026 Collection** that hit shelves January 30th for just $14.99-$15. As a die-hard collector who's been chasing cards since the Base Set days, I had to dive in and share my opening story—because this little box punched way above its weight in nostalgia and surprises!

Picture this: It's a chilly Saturday morning, coffee in hand, and I'm ripping into the box like it's 1996 all over again. Here's what you get straight out the gate:

- **1 foil promo card**: A gorgeous stamped Pikachu pulled from *Temporal Forces*, now rocking that exclusive Pokémon Day stamp. It's got that classic holo shine with a metallic edge—feels premium without being over-the-top.
- **1 metallic coin**: Etched with the 30th anniversary logo. Super tactile, flips like a dream for any casual battles or display vibes.
- **3 booster packs** from random expansions—mine were two *Fantasma Flames* and one *Mega Evolution*. Talk about luck! These aren't your standard sealed packs; they mix recent sets for that chase-factor high.

I hit play on some old-school Pokémon Red/Green OST and cracked 'em open. First pack (*Fantasma Flames*): A solid SR reverse holo—nothing chase-level, but the artwork had me grinning. Second *Fantasma Flames*: Medium holo, still building steam. Then the *Mega Evolution* pack... boom! **Lucario STR** right out the gate, followed by teases of Gardevoir potential. No god-packs, but stacking those hits on just three packs? Felt like striking gold.

What makes this collection a storytelling gem is how it bridges eras. That Pikachu promo? It's a reprint with anniversary flair, evoking memories of my first-ever tournament win with a Pikachu deck back in '98. The coin's got me hyped for potential events—rumors swirling about classic games like Red/Green hitting eShops with HOME connectivity, plus shiny giveaways tied to Colosseum/XD and Legends Z-A. Imagine sleeving this promo into a legacy deck for Pokémon Day streams!

Value-wise, it's a steal at MSRP. Secondary market's hovering $30 with *Ascended Heroes* bundles, but grabbing it early means pure profit in pulls and flex. If you're on the fence, hunt local shops or online—stock's moving fast. I've already grabbed two more for gifts; one's heading to my niece who's just starting her journey.

Who's cracked theirs open? Spill your pulls below—what'd the random packs bless you with? Did anyone land a Charizard ex or that elusive Gardevoir? Upvote if you're feeling the 30th anniv hype, and let's keep the stories flowing. Pika-power forever! ⚡🃏

ProximityLock solves this problem seamlessly and flawlessly.

I use my Apple Watch as the proximity device, however, you can also use any Bluetooth device that is has BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

When I walk away from my computer, ProximityLock automatically locks my computer. No more thinking about locking it before I get up to grab some coffee, go to the bathroom, absent-mindedly walking away while on an important call, or leaving the house to run errands in a hurry.

The effective distance at which your mac will lock can be customized very precisely and there's even a section of the GUI which shows the current signal strength.

For those of you who love Shortcuts, there is support for shortcuts baked in that allows more advanced configurations. You can find more details about that [here](https://proximityshortcuts.app/guide).

There's also a mac app version, but it's more limited as explained by the developer:

>ProximityLock uses private APIs to lock your screen immediately, but it is not allowed on the App Store. So that was the original idea - a security app. Later based on user feedback, Shortcuts integration was added as an option. If you prefer the App Store, there is now ProximityLock's sister app ProximityShortcuts available which works with Shortcuts only. Shortcuts however can still be configured to lock your screen or start the screensaver. [proximityshortcuts.app](https://proximityshortcuts.app)

**Best of all:**

* One-time purchase cost of $14.99 ($12.99 for App Store version)
* 14 day free trial & 30 day money back guarantee
* Clear and concise privacy policy which emphasizes minimal data collection. Essentially what is necessary for functionality. I cut it off from the internet with Little Snitch and have had zero issues.
* Brew support is coming at some point
* The developer is responsive and passionate about the project",2,1769907070.0,macapps,0,1.0,False

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. I love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too.

1qsjpxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1qsjpxd/nobuy_january_report_credit_card_down_60/,No-Buy January Report - Credit card down 60%!,"January No-Buy kicked off because of my awful credit card bill in December. $4,200 USD (I’m not American but converting it) and it was honestly 90% on pure shopping nonsense that was driven out of boredom.

I felt pretty disgusted with myself for all that excess and lack of self-control, especially when I already have tons of clothes and skincare. So I decided to implement two things: A Low-Buy 2026, and a No-Buy January. Ideally I’d do a full year of No-Buy but I knew that would be unrealistic and then I’d fall off the wagon and go on a shopping binge, so I decided to loosen up the boundaries to a Low Buy year.

**January No-Buy rules**: Absolutely no shopping on skincare, makeup, clothes and shoes as these are significant problem areas (I just have so much stuff). 

**January Goal:** Use money that I would have spent to invest in index funds instead.

**January Report:** Success! I didn’t shop at all on the categories above and my January credit card bill has gone down to $1,500 (there is still a lot of fat to be cut in terms of eating out, celebrations etc but that’s a different story). 

What helped me:

**“Shopping” my Inventory:** I have a lot of inventory of skincare and makeup because I work in beauty. Despite having had all this inventory, it’s never stopped me from shopping for the next cute new thing. This time, I went through all my inventory, organized it and made sure I knew what I had (a lot of them I had forgotten). 

**Understanding The Cost of what I’m Using:** Every time I finished using a product, I would log the item in ChatGPT. In January, I finished using 17 items (skincare, bodycare etc) and the total cost of it was $400 USD. Somehow, when I logged these things it felt like I was “spending” $400 USD again, I don’t know how to explain it well but it almost made me feel like I was shopping again. Whenever I decluttered something, I also logged it into ChatGPT. This also showed me how much money I was wasting on things I’d end up decluttering. 

**Activating “Monk Mode” week.** Specifically for one week, I was very strict on myself. On top of the No-Buy of clothes, skincare and shoes etc, I also didn’t eat out or have coffees outside. It was actually easier to be disciplined knowing “Okay, this is only for a week.” And when I did that, I actually didn’t feel like I was missing out big time or anything, and it’s also not as if I went and had double the coffees the week after. I am going to continue to do this for the rest of the year. 

**Pretending I Was About To Move**: If I had to move countries tomorrow, would I bring this item with me? Would it be important enough for me to spend money on it, and then spend money moving it? Most of the time the answer would be a no. This mindset also helped me in decluttering a few things I found hard to let go of. 

**Visually Seeing The Difference:** Because I had started tidying my stash up and being more disciplined in using things up, my bathroom sink became significantly less cluttered. Now, when I wake up and go to my bathroom, it just feels good coming to a tidier and clearer space. It also reinforces that this No-Buy, less clutter lifestyle is now more in line with the values I want to hold.

While I’m happy with how January went, it made me realize there were a lot of other areas in my life to cut down on. Eating out, and sweet treats namely. I feel like donuts made their appearance way too many times in January and that’s gotta stop. In February, on top of continuing the above I’m going to make effort to decrease mindless snacking and treats. 

I'd also like to say thanks to people on this sub, because I would read about your progress and it would be super motivating for me to stick with it. I remember one person writing and talking about how they really wanted to not eat their packed lunch but go out and another person advising to just eat a few bites and realize it wouldn't be that bad. This trick actually helped me save on quite a few take-outs, so thanks for that! 

Please also share your No-Buy January wins (or misses!)! I would love to hear what worked/ didn’t work for you.

I love gourmands, fresh florals, and perfumes that are whimsical/fantastical

I'm not a big fan of citrusy and powdery perfumes.

I'm starting with Sorce because they are the house where I have tried the most fragrances, but I hope to try/review other houses as well!

**2 AM in Lafayette**: This one is so unbelievably delicious. I love the coffee note in this one, but my favorite part is the caramelly, buttery dry down. I wear this to bed, to the store, to boost my mood… literally everywhere. I love her. Lasts 8+ hours on me, light-moderate sillage. **Vanilla co2, oakmoss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar \*earthy gourmand** (EDP) 5/5 - FSed

**Cabanilla**: This is a beautiful hot beach sun screen. I cannot wait to wear this in the summer. I love that this coconut is not artificial, it is so fruity and fresh! I close my eyes when I smell this and am instantly transported on vacation despite being surrounded by snow and ice. The dry down is more smokey and woody which I am a little less in love with, but I still thoroughly enjoy this fragrance. This lasted around 5 hours with light to moderate sillage. **Salted vanilla, sand, palm fronds, driftwood, a cracked coconut, brown sugar, balsam of Peru, and a distant beach bonfire \*vanilla musk** (EDP) ⅘ - FSed

**C'est Noel**: This is another coffee scent but it pulls much more burnt coffee grounds than it does a cup of black coffee. To me, I get a lot of smoke and incense but almost no cinnamon bread. I don’t ever really wear this one out just because the combination of the coffee grounds plus the smoke comes off so burnt. Lasts 5-6 hours on my skin, light sillage. **Coffee, freshly baked cinnamon bread, roasted chestnuts, blown out candles, lingering church incense, and softly falling snow (EDP) 1/5**  \- Will not FS

**Clairsentient**: I really enjoy this one, somehow they manage to make it smell effervescent. I’m routinely amazed by Sorce’s ability to create these incredibly niche sensations. The oil kind of disappears on my skin after about an hour, and sits very close to the skin. **A fizzy blackberry, raspberry and bergamot cocktail, spun sugar, juniper berries, floaty vanilla, Iso E Super (Oil)** 3.75/5 - want to get a 15ml EDP

**Dragonfly Wings**: Fruitloops! This is so starchy and pretty. I love smelling it from the bottle, but it smells really pink pepper heavy on my skin. I LOVE the rice note in this and the white florals are stunning. I still really like it, my only wish is that the pink pepper notes from Sorce weren’t so overpowering. This lasts 6 hours and has light sillage.  **White lotus absolute, jasmine sambac absolute, umeshu (also known as plum wine), peonies, sparkling lake water, white rice, lily pads, cotton, blonde woods, and a hint of pink pepper** (EDP) 3.5/5- Will not FS

**Dreaming Evil**: Okay, another miss. This one in the oil form is just sooooo potent and although very chocolatey, feels almost medicinal? It lingers in my nose for a long time in a way that i just don’t like. Kind of reminds me of Licorice but I don't know why. **Vanilla, tonka bean, benzoin, cocoa, sheer woods, oud** (Oil) ⅕ - Will not FS

**English Major**: This is pretty, I have to be in a very specific mood for it, but it’s pretty. It really reminds me of these crystalized Iris candies from Gilli in Florence. Or maybe cream candies with real fruit flavoring. The other thing I immediately think of is a tube of powdery lipstick and some paint? I’m not really sure I get any other distinguishable notes. This has decent lasting power on my skin (6 hours) and moderate sillage. **library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis absolute (sustainably harvested), carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves \*earthy gourmand** (EDP) 3/5 - Will not FS

**Good at Being Bad**: Straight baby powder. When I open this cap, all I can think of are diaper bags and desatin. It is so powdery, and I get no buttercream, honey, or caramel. It lasts 4-5 hours on my skin and has decent sillage but I really don’t like it so… **Dark, salted vanilla, buttercream, a swirl of honey, and a whisper of jasmine** (EDP) ⅕ - Will not FS

**In Dreams and Fairy Tales**: So I had an older bottle of this that I left in my closet for several months, and when I returned I became completely obsessed with the oxidized version of the perfume. It smells so delicious. Like German vanillin zucker. It’s definitely much sweeter than a vanilla extract-esque perfume, but I love that it smells like baking with my family. My biggest con is it only lasts 3 hours on my skin. However, I loved it so much I bought a full size and am currently waiting for it to oxidize. **Baked meringue, vanilla bean absolute, sugar, a sprinkle of chamomile \*gourmand vanilla** (Older EDP and brand new EDP) 4/5 - FSed

**Match Made in Heaven**: Um… I’m very sad. Everyone loves this one!! Mine is not a delicious fresh waffle cone, with vanilla ice cream and matcha. No, instead it’s wood shavings, grass, and bread. I didn’t even try to keep this one on because I was so devastated (and somewhat nauseated). It must be a me problem. **matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood \*slightly floral gourmand** (EDP) 1/5 - traded away

**Nothing Burns Like the Cold**: Love <3 it kind of reminds me of the taste of sweet steamy coconut sticky rice. When it dries down the caramel really comes through and is absolutely delicious. The only thing I don’t really smell at all is the jasmine. It lasts 6-7 hours with low-medium sillage.  **Jasmine absolute, toasted rice, saffron threads, luscious caramel, a trio of vanillas (vanilla CO2, vanilla planifolia accord, and a house tincture of Madagascan vanilla beans), Ambroxan, and velvety musk** (EDP) 4.5/5 - will hopefully FS

**Serpentine**:  I hadn’t anticipated liking this one- just because it’s not my vibe- and AGHHHHH I was right. This is a citronella candle. Sadly, it's so close to bug spray on my skin. I’m ashamed to say I scrubbed this one off (luckily it was a free sample), but I can’t  speak to longevity or sillage. **Ripe figs, fig leaf, cardamom, caramelized honey, vanilla, Peru balsam, Cedar, Iso E Super \*sweet aromatic woods** (EDP) ⅕ (but it’s not my style either) - no

**Snow Moon Magic**: Shockingly, at first, I hated this. I bought a 15ml because EVERYONE raved about this perfume. As someone who is Indian and drinks chai I was underwhelmed. Eventually I stopped thinking of this as a chai fragrance and started thinking of it as a cookie perfume and I like it a lot more. My absolute favorite part of this is the dry down, it is quite food. This lasts 7-8 hours on me and is pretty strong (my younger brother absolutely hates that I like to smell like food and coincidentally hates when I wear this one).  **Moon Magic gets extra cozy for winter with the addition of fluffy marshmallow, a house tincture of Tahitian vanilla beans, and gooey cookie butter \*true gourmand** (EDP) 3.5/5 - Will not FS

**The Things Unsaid**: I don’t like it. I smell rain. I get tons of pink pepper and cedar. But I don't like it. Vaguely reminds me of Herbal Essence or Garnier i just can’t remember which one. I just got this as a sample from my waitlist order and I was honestly thinking of getting a travel size before this, but I am so glad I got the sample first. It’s pretty strong at first, but it disappeared pretty quickly on me (4 hours) **spring rain, pink pepper, saucer magnolia, peony, raspberry, cotton, cedar** \*aquatic floral (EDP) 2/5 - Will not FS

**Villanelle's Happy Ending**: So I think pink pepper from Sorce just doesn’t work for me. I’m quite sad about it because I was dying for a complex strawberry milk perfume. This reminds me of an really artificial strawberry candy and the strawberry yogis / yogurt melts for babies (but overly sweet). It’s decently strong on me, lasting 6 hours and with medium strength sillage. **Pink pepper, strawberry milk, vanilla, cherry blossom, Cashmeran, creamy dreamy sandalwood, cedar, cyanide** (EDP) ⅕ - Will not FS

**Witchery**: I feel like a fairy in the Hoh Rainforest. If you’ve seen Disney’s Fantasia 2000, this perfume reminds me of the beautiful Spring Sprite from the Firebird Suite. The blackberry in this is so fresh and thorny. Growing up my Tuscan grandmother used to take me into her fields to pick wild blackberries, and this perfume reminds me so much of holding her hand and staining my lips purple. It definitely leans more masculine than feminine, and is not very sweet at all (I don’t believe it to be a safe blind buy), but I love it. It lasts 5-6 hours on me with moderate to strong sillage. \*\*Blackberries, wild violets, galbanum, green stems and thorns, oak moss, benzoin, tree moss, wet stone, mountain mist \*mossy green fruit (\*\*EDP) 3.75/5 - FSed

**Your Girlfriend is a Badass**: This is, in fact, fudge icing with dirt. It’s not the most wearable to me but it is an incredibly photorealistic yellow fudge cake. Lasts 5 hours and sticks so close to my skin barely any sillage. **Yellow cake with fudge icing, oakmoss, Himalayan cedar, forest floor (EDP)** 2/5 - will not FS

New bottles : I have no issues with the bows on the new bottles as I just turn the nozzle around and spray from the other direction, however, the new bottles are leakier. Every time I pull the caps off, there is perfume that's just accumulated for no reason.

I'm looking to sample: she's a witch, i think about you too, follow me into the deep, a party or something, beautiful but annihilating, and this is not a love spell

If you have any thoughts on those perfumes or any others that you'd recommend I would love to hear them! I'm also always curious to explore other brands so I would be ecstatic to receive thoughts on those as well!

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1qsjmd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qsjmd5/how_to_fix_your_mental_health_when_everything/,How to Fix Your Mental Health When Everything Falls Apart: The Science-Based Guide,"Look, if you're here reading this, chances are you're not doing great. Maybe you're exhausted all the time, maybe everything feels pointless, or maybe you just can't shake this heaviness that follows you around. I get it. And here's what nobody tells you: \*\*you're not broken\*\*. Your brain is just overloaded, understimulated in the wrong ways, or stuck in survival mode. After digging through research, podcasts, books, and way too many late-night rabbit holes, I've pieced together what actually works. Not the ""just think positive"" garbage, but real, science-backed strategies that can pull you out of the pit.

**Step 1: Stop Treating Your Brain Like a Machine**

Your brain isn't built for 2025. It's built for survival on the savanna, not for scrolling through 47 tabs while worrying about your career, relationships, and that text you sent three hours ago. \*\*Chronic stress\*\* literally rewires your brain. Your amygdala (fear center) gets bigger, and your prefrontal cortex (decision-making) gets weaker. You're not weak. Your hardware is just running on outdated software in an environment it wasn't designed for.

Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast. Your nervous system gets stuck in ""threat mode,"" and everything feels harder than it should. The fix? You've got to manually downshift your nervous system. And no, deep breathing isn't some hippie nonsense. It's physiology.

\*\*Try this\*\*: Box breathing. Four seconds in, hold four, out four, hold four. Do it for two minutes when you feel overwhelmed. It activates your parasympathetic nervous system and tells your brain, ""Hey, we're not dying right now.""

 **Step 2: Your Habits Are Destroying You (and You Don't Even Know It)**

Here's the brutal truth: most mental health struggles aren't just ""in your head."" They're in your daily habits. Bad sleep, zero exercise, a trash diet, and constant overstimulation create the perfect storm for anxiety and depression.

\*\*Sleep hygiene\*\* is non-negotiable. Matthew Walker's book \*Why We Sleep\* will genuinely scare you straight. Lack of sleep demolishes your emotional regulation, memory, and mental resilience. If you're sleeping less than seven hours consistently, you're basically running your brain on 30% battery all day.

\*\*Action steps\*\*:

\* No screens one hour before bed. Yeah, I know. Do it anyway.

\* Keep your room cold (65-68°F). Your body needs to drop temperature to sleep.

\* Same sleep and wake time every day. Weekends included.

For exercise, you don't need a gym membership or some crazy routine. Just move your body. Twenty minutes of walking outside does more for your mental health than most antidepressants. Sunlight exposure in the morning resets your circadian rhythm and boosts serotonin. It's stupidly simple but insanely effective.

**Step 3: Get Real About Your Phone Addiction**

Your phone is probably the biggest mental health destroyer in your life right now, and you don't want to admit it. Social media is engineered to hijack your dopamine system. Every notification, like, and scroll gives you a tiny hit that keeps you coming back. But it's junk food for your brain. You're getting stimulation without satisfaction, and it's making you miserable.

Cal Newport's book \*Digital Minimalism\* changed how I see technology. It's not about going full monk mode. It's about being intentional. Ask yourself: ""Does this app add value to my life, or does it just kill time?""

\*\*Try this\*\*:

\* Delete social media apps from your phone for one week. Just one week.

\* Use the Screen Time feature to set hard limits.

\* Turn off all non-essential notifications.

Replace mindless scrolling with something that actually fills your cup. Read, walk, cook, or call a friend. Anything that requires active engagement instead of passive consumption.

If you want a more structured way to turn all this knowledge into actual progress, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI learning app that pulls from sources like the books and research mentioned here, plus expert talks and scientific papers, then turns them into personalized audio content based on your specific struggles. 

Want to build better sleep habits as someone with ADHD? Or understand your anxiety patterns better? Type in your goal, and it creates a learning plan just for you. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too; there's even a smoky, calm voice that's perfect for evening listening. It's basically designed to replace doomscrolling with something that actually helps you grow.

**Step 4: Talk to Someone (Yes, Really)**

Therapy isn't just for people in crisis. It's maintenance. Your car needs oil changes. Your teeth need cleanings. Your brain needs someone to help you process the chaos. But finding a good therapist is hard, and it's expensive. If traditional therapy isn't an option, there are alternatives.

\*\*BetterHelp\*\* gets a lot of hate, but it's legitimately helpful for people who need affordable, accessible therapy. You get matched with a licensed therapist and can text them anytime. It's not perfect, but it's better than suffering in silence.

If therapy still feels too big, try \*\*journaling\*\*. And I don't mean ""dear diary"" stuff. I mean structured, no-BS journaling. Julia Cameron's \*The Artist's Way\* introduced me to ""morning pages,"" three pages of stream-of-consciousness writing first thing in the morning. It clears mental clutter like nothing else. You're basically taking the swirling anxiety in your head and dumping it onto paper where it can't hurt you.

**Step 5: Build Micro-Moments of Joy**

When mental health tanks, everything feels gray. You stop doing things you used to love. You isolate. You scroll. This is where you need to force yourself to do small things that bring even a flicker of joy.

\*\*Make a list\*\* of ten tiny things that make you feel slightly better. Not big stuff. Micro stuff. Like:

\* Drinking coffee in the morning sun

\* Petting a dog

\* Listening to one specific song that hits different

\* Taking a hot shower

Do one per day. Just one. You're not trying to fix everything. You're just trying to give your brain evidence that life isn't entirely garbage.

**Step 6: Stop Consuming Negativity Like It's Content**

Doomscrolling is real, and it's killing your mental health. Your brain can't tell the difference between real threats and threats on a screen. When you watch hours of bad news, your nervous system reacts like the danger is happening to you. 

Set boundaries. Limit news intake to ten minutes a day. Unfollow accounts that make you feel worse. Curate your digital environment like your life depends on it, because honestly, your mental health does.

**Step 7: Find Your People**

Loneliness is deadlier than smoking fifteen cigarettes a day. That's not an exaggeration; that's research. Humans are wired for connection, and isolation makes everything worse. If you don't have people in your life who get it, find them.

Join communities around things you care about. Reddit, Discord, and local meetups. Doesn't matter. Just find people who understand what you're going through. The \*\*Finch app\*\* is actually solid for this too. It's a self-care app with a supportive community and daily check-ins, and it gamifies mental health in a way that doesn't feel cringe.

**Step 8: Accept That Healing Isn't Linear**

Some days will suck. You'll backslide. You'll feel like you're making no progress. That's part of it. Healing isn't this smooth upward trajectory. It's messy, it's frustrating, and it takes time. Be patient with yourself. You didn't fall apart overnight, and you won't heal overnight either.

The goal isn't to feel amazing every day. The goal is to build systems and habits that make the bad days more manageable and the good days more frequent.

You're not falling apart. You're just exhausted from holding it all together for too long. Start small. One thing at a time. You've got this.",1,1769906679.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

The conversations began when I was 15. On vacation in another state I was in a gay chat room on AOL and in my profile had stated that I was a Jehovah’s witness. I received a private message stating that it was weird for a Jehovah’s Witness to be in a gay chat room. I freaked. Who are you? What do you know about me? Turns out he didn’t know me but he himself was raised as a Jw and his parents went to a congregation near where I lived. 

He lived in LA and was a writer and nanny for a famous chefs kids. And friends with all sorts of famous people. I was of course intrigued. Impressionable. I was 15. 

The chats progressed to phone calls. He had an 800 number for me to be able to call him. I guess my parents never looked at their phone bill because I was never questioned about it. 

We would have phone s\*x and he would always say how hot I was, and the things he wanted to do, and how hot it was that we would c\*m at the same time. 

He sent me clothing addressed to my friends house so my parents wouldn’t know. Armani. Oooh. 

We werent rich idk why they never questioned me where I got the new clothes from. 

When I was 16 he came back east from LA “to visit his parents” and at this point I had left public school and was driving so of course lied to the parents and went to meet him at the mall. We saw the Mel Gibson movie “What Women Want” and he gave me h\*\*d under my coat. And then in the bathroom. And then in his car in the parking lot. Two days in a row. Multiple times. 

The conversations and phone s\*x  continued for years. And when I was 18 he confessed to me that he had lied about his age when we met. He had told me he was 25 but was actually 31. 

I got over it. And flew to LA when I was 19 to visit him. He took me to some famous friends homes. Big time directors. Suspected creeps and pedos as it turns out. I had a blast partying but none of this clicked until he got mad at me for not dancing with him at this club we went to and freaked out on me the next day. While he went out for coffee I dipped and went to the airport and flew home. 

Still to this day I have no idea how old he really is. 

I was 15/16 and h\*rn\*. I knew what I was doing and liked it. But I had been groomed. And lied to. And abused. I haven’t “suffered” but have come across some mental health and emotional issues that I trip up on and can only link the to this. 

I am in NY and I know there were some statute of limitations changes recently but is this too far gone? I doubt there would be any record of our AOL chats or texts or calls at this point. ",2,1769906339.0,MenGetRapedToo,0,1.0,False

​

The spiders ran across the shelf with a speed that I found both grotesque and beautiful. On one hand, their grace and control were surely unmatched by any other living creature (at least dwelling in this home), but on the other, they possessed no muscle, no blood, no life? *Surely they did, if only for a moment.* I thought as I mashed down on them swiftly.

​

The things were big but not large enough that I was uncomfortable mashing down on them with my bare hand, though one was in fact quite large and nearly made me consider bringing out the swatter. Very quickly after squishing the thing, I wished I had never even touched the thing, as when I lifted my hand, a million babies scattered all across the shelf. Lifting my hand, I screamed out, tilting back foolishly and very quickly losing all balance. At the time, I stood on a rotating chair, which I had to keep supreme balance to even think of operating on. In my shock, I forgot this simple fact and found myself crashing to the ground at a vicious speed. Trying to find my landing, my arm shot out at an awkward angle and crunched loudly upon impact. Screaming out in crackling pain, there was no one to hear me. I lived alone, and I had for a very long time.

​

Sitting in that chair the next day with my scrawny arm packed tightly into a bright pink cast I cursed myself endlessly as I attempted to type out the remainder of the email I set out to compose to my pharmacy job as to why I would not be coming in. Leaning back I tilted in the chair and my eyes turned to the top shelf which I had been fiddling around at the time of the cataclysmic incident. *Those things won’t be babies for long.* My skin crawled, and I bolted up, looking intensely at my computer screen. *I won’t have my job for long if I keep this up.*

​

For the next twenty minutes or so, I typed away to the best of my ability, attempting to calibrate my reasoning as tightly as possible to escape any kind of repercussion. My job as a pharmacy aide was all I had going for me during my schooling at the University of Colorado, and single-handedly kept my food, water, and housing afloat while my grades slipped further and further down the drain. School and a job were enough to keep me stressed to the bone but what really made me fail at both was a lot deeper than the stress that either commitment could hope to bring. After my arm was put into a steady position and I awaited further treatment, I tried with every ounce of my being to avoid suspicion of anything else being wrong with me, though I do not think I did a very good job. My nurse asked questions endlessly about my habits, diet, activity levels, and… my sleep schedule. This five-foot-nothing pale girl was no kind of intimidating figure, but still, my palms sweated attempting to lie about what I now just considered a fact of life.

​

“Eight hours! Seven on a busy day,” I told her brightly, but knew my gray complexion and deep eye bags told a different story.

​

The girl nodded and moved on with the exam, but it was clear as day she did not believe me. The truth was, I did not sleep. I did not sleep, and I had not for the last six months or so. The nurse continued her examination, and I only half followed along; the rest of my brain was stuck in a haze as it usually was and as I supposed it always would be, at least if things continued like this.

​

“Sir?” The nurse had asked me when my haze reached its deepest depths.

​

“Yez, Ma’am?” I shot up and looked at her with greater clarity.

​

“I asked you if you are currently prescribed any medications.”

​

“Oh no, not since I was a little kid. ADHD had me bad as a boy.” She nodded quietly as she wrote. *Oh yeah, she thinks I’m off something for sure. Never seen a man coming up on two hundred days without catching Z’s.*

​

Since then, the constant intake of pain medication has been bringing my consciousness even further into oblivion, which I’m sure reflected in my email to my work. *Oh well, this is just going to have to do.* And after a brief skim, it was submitted. Taking in a deep breath of air, I felt my body rattle and ache. *The human body really is so fragile, and I’m sure my ‘condition’ doesn’t make it much better.* My head slunk back, and gaze toward the yellowing ceiling in my cheap one-bedroom apartment. Feeling an urge that was ever so familiar, my eyes began to flutter, and with it, my consciousness drifted. Usually, when this happens, I’ve been able to raise myself out of it with swift movement or an energy drink of some sorts but I guess it all just slipped away in the moment with all the meds and such.

​

The jewels and diamonds that covered my body were extravagant beyond belief, and I felt a thumping begin in my chest. *Could it really be? All of this? Just for me?* I clutched the objects of wealth around me and brought as many of them onto my person as possible. Right now, I appeared to be in some kind of bright hallway which led to nowhere, but after a moment of walking, I could see that this was not true. A door appeared dimly in the distance, and I picked up the pace to reach it. Finally touching it, I had to relinquish a number of my newly acquired jewels in order to free up enough space to open the door, but once I did, I was immediately glad I did.

Inside was my childhood home. And if not that, then a damn good replica of it. Stepping through, I immediately remembered the sweet scent that I would enjoy from the Sunday morning baking put on by my mother. *Mother.* Whipping my head around from the kitchen, I turned to face the open wall to the living room. Standing there was my mother. The woman who had raised me stood tall in the golden sunlight passing through the blinds in relation to their pattern, but despite this, her figure was entirely grey. The clothes, her skin, her hair, all of it was void of color. On top of all of this, her eyes, which usually had a warm dark brown appearance, were black and completely out of sight.

​

“Mother?” I called out to her with terrible uncertainty.

​

“Yes?” Her voice whispered right in my ear, and I jerked violently away to look to my side and saw nothing. Looking back to the living room, my mother was now gone, replaced by a splotch of grey where she had once stood. Heart beating fast, I walked towards the dark air and looked into it deeply.

​

“What the hell is this? Where are you?” I called into it. Slowly, I reached out to touch the thing, my hand shaking.

​

“Don’t,” the voice sounded right by my ear, and I swerved hard, straining something in my neck from the sheer speed of my reaction.

​

“What the fuck is this?” I screamed.

​

Desperately, I looked around for any solid source of the sound. Then, with a slowness that seemed to last an eternity, I felt a cold breath slowly hit my ear.

​

“You remember what you did, and I just can’t forgive it, baby.” I picked up the lamp on the coffee table, which had existed there my entire childhood, and smashed it into the wall in the direction of the voice.

​

“Shut up! SHUT THE FUCK UP!” I screamed, my voice breaking as I did. Cold sweat ran down my face, and my eyes bounced around the room. Quickly, I began turning my head, attempting to find something, anything. Then, with a quickness and volume that split my head like a melon, laughter ensued all across the room. Echoing into my mind and through my bones.

​

“You don’t see me, but I see you. YOU DON’T SEE ME, BUT I SEE YOU!” Her voice screamed out, and I shrieked. Falling to the ground, I banged my knees hard as I did.

​

“LEAVE ME ALONE!” I shrieked again and again until a hand, feeling to be twice as long as my own, wrapped around my neck and squeezed with a frozen grip that sent me bolting upright in my bed.

​

Looking around the dark room, my heart thumped, and my breath was quick and fatigued. I looked below me and recognized my bed was absolutely drenched in sweat. *What a dream.* I thought to myself as I sighed. My six-month streak of restlessness had been broken, and it had ended in the exact way my last, much shorter, streak had.

​

“Why do you do this to me?” My voice came out weak and shattered, but I supposed it didn't matter. I was alone, wasn’t I? My room was dark, only illuminated by the beeping green light of my dvd player, so it wasn’t always possible that a masked man stood hiding in the corner waiting for me. I used to think so when I was just a boy. Staring at the light for several moments more, I eventually shoved myself back down into the bed and stared at the ceiling. *How did I get into my bed?*

​

The next morning, I walked to work with a jitter that I recognized from my first week or so of sleep deprivation. Since I unwillingly slipped away into dreams, I figured all of the early effects I believed I had built a resistance to would return. Since my time awake I had found no answers to my question about how I mysteriously traveled from my chair to my bed during my slumber, but due to the contents of my dream, I figured it was not out of the question that I had struggled there myself.

​

Walking into the pharmacy, which existed on the corner of a first-floor building, I was relieved to feel the heater was operating at maximum efficiency. From the door, I peered over the counter and recognized the very dark eyes I was looking for. Julie was a Hispanic girl who moved up from Texas, who both worked in my beloved pharmacy and attended University alongside me.

​

“Sick day yesterday?” She asked absently as she reached high to place a medicine container high above her head.

​

“Ehh, something like that,” I chuckled, and she looked back over her shoulder, dropping the medicine when her eyes reached my stylishly colored cast.

​

“Jesus Christ, what happened?” She said, now with both hands on the counter, leaning in close to get a good look.

​

“A little accident, I guess. It was really pretty embarrassing to tell you the truth.”

​

“Oh yeah? Take a tumble while playing volleyball?” She laughed, and I took notice of her dark eyes flashing up at me. On the topic of her comment, I had told her of my middle school and early high school exploits as a male volleyball player. She had not let it go since.

​

“Even worse, tipped right off a swivel chair,” I said as I passed through the door to enter behind the counter.

​

“Oh, I’m so sorry.” Her face frowned, but I saw that same spark in her eyes and laughed. She laughed with me.

​

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” she giggled, trying her best and failing to stifle herself by covering her mouth. “But c’mon, what the hell were you doing, Haden?”

​

“Trying to kill spiders if you’ll believe it.” She had picked up a newspaper to move it out of the way, but smacked my arm firmly with it at my comment.

​

“Haden! You know you’re not supposed to do that! With all these insects moving up north, we're gonna need as many of those little guys as we can get!” She turned away from me with a playful scowl, and I smiled as I walked away. There would be time for more of this later, but first, I would have to deal with the boss man. My email had not been responded to yesterday, and I knew that likely meant something malicious was brewing up in that dingy office just down the hall. As my hand rested on the door, I swallowed a thick bit of saliva that had been forming in my mouth and, in short order, had my entire five-month employment flash before my eyes.

​

Finally, building up the nerve, I meagerly opened the door and at once came into the gaze of the man whom I had been dreading all this time.

​

“I got your email, Mr. Davis. Not very professional.” The tall, collected man who stood in front of me before his desk said calmly.

​

“Uhh, yeah, I’m sorry about that. The painkillers they prescribed me had me a little loopy…” I straightened up a bit. “I still wanted to get a message out to you, Sir.”

​

“I see. I suppose I can understand an accident of such proportions and subsequent response. But are you aware of any other issues detectable in your performance as of late?” The cold words rang in my head, and I felt a sweat begin down my neck. *Shit.*

​

“Not exactly, no, Sir.” Mr. Vega breathed in shallowly and rubbed his pointer finger softly on his thumb when not speaking. *Calculating.*

​

“Well, Mr. Davis, you may not, but I *have.*” I felt myself cringe and wished more than anything else that I could just leave as quickly as possible. “You’ve always been a punctual man, I'll give you that. When it comes to getting to work on time and agreeing to work over your agreed hours, you’ve always been reliable, which is a big reason why I’ve kept you on this long. But beyond the hours, there have been long-held concerns about your *productivity*.” Mr. Vega lifted from his desk and stood taller. “General sluggishness, a lack of effort, unprofessionalism with other employees.” My face flushed. “Your excuses have done little to cover this track record.” Now he stepped forward, getting right in my face and grimacing. “So I release you from your position.” After this, he continued talking, but I could not find myself able to listen. Walking out of the room, Julie quickly met my eyes despite my attempt to evade hers.

​

“What’s up? Where are you going?” She asked, increasingly concerned as I grabbed my coat from the employee's rack and began walking towards the door.

​

“I’ll call you, I promise. I just need to get out of here.” And with that, I was whisked away into the freezing Colorado winds. Finding myself back at home, I must have stared blankly at the wall in a daze of sleepless jitters and medication for hours, as when I finally awoke from my state, it was becoming dark.

​

“If you have anything to tell me now, I suggest you do it,” I spoke out, but I really don’t know who I meant it for. Perhaps the wide variety of pills, which formed in a lavish spread across my glass table, over the last couple of hours. It wouldn't surprise me if I had mindlessly popped a couple of them, but who was keeping count anyway? My chest started feeling tight, and a cough erupted from deep within me. just when I was beginning to get a hold of it, I heard a faint whisper that made me jump and look around the cramped apartment with bulging eyes.

​

“Who was that? Who’s there?” I screamed out. Jumping to hysteria, blindingly quick in my state. The silence that followed buried itself in my mind, and every little breath that I took felt like something waiting behind the corner to assault me. My body shook and twitched with an aggressiveness that sent aches reeling across my body. In an intense and, at least by feeling, nearly fatal heart thumping, the tension peaked when the phone on the wall behind me rang, reverberating through the quiet box.

​

Rushing over to the little device, I grabbed it manically and said nothing, awaiting whoever it was to get on with it.

​

“Haden? Are you okay? I wanted to talk about what happened at work.” 

​

In just thirty minutes, we were walking down the now ever colder streets of the city, chatting regularly about our day, though I avoided what was really up, much to her notice. Over the phone, I told her it would be best if I saw her in person, and she offered to take me to dinner. In all other circumstances, I likely would have refused and told her it was *she* who would be getting taken out, but on a day like today, I accepted the kindness without question. Entering the classy spot she picked out the yellow light from the ceiling's tinted glass light illuminated her hair and dark skin in a way that distracted me from whatever she said while we took our seats.

​

“Haden, I need to know what happened today? Will you be coming in tomorrow?” I tried to meet her gaze but found myself only able to speak, looking at the wooden table in front of me.

​

“I got fired today.”

​

“What? That bastard! I’ll be talking to his ass tomorrow-”

​

“Don’t. You know I deserve it. I’ve been acting like an idiot as of late, and this was just the last straw.” I spoke meagerly, and Julie just shook her head.

​

“But your sleep! The only reason you’ve been this way has been because of that. And don’t blame that on yourself because you know that’s not true!” She sat silent for a moment as if trying to decide whether or not something was right to say. “I know you don’t like to talk about it but it’s not a coincidence this started right after your mom died-”

​

“Look, I appreciate you taking me out here like this, but I don’t want to hear this right now.” After that, Julie went quiet for some time, and in the state I was in, I honestly couldn’t tell you the contents of any bit of the rest of our conversation from that night. I’m sure I made a total ass of myself, looking like a junkie, which I figured at this point I really was now. We had split off earlier than we usually did on our walks out together and I had walked home mostly alone. Now I stood outside my door fumbling with the keys, eventually locking my brain into place enough to get the bolt to shift. Opening the door, I supposed I felt something off when I walked in, but I would recognize far too late that what I had just walked into was not the poor, dingy apartment of my present but my old home. I stepped into the home and took in a deep breath of air, walking past the kitchen and into the living room where I sat and took a deep breath. *That smell of baking.*

​

A wave of shock went through me as I began dimly coming to an awareness that something was wrong in two forty-nine, Maldaga apartments. I attempted to flick on a light, but it did nothing. Interacting physically with the environment must have been what powered my brain enough to realize exactly what was wrong, but it was too late.

​

“What the hell…” I had barely uttered these words when a shrill, ear-splitting cry burst from behind the door that I had neglected to shut. Turning swiftly, I had little time to process what came upon me. The terror was brief and sharp. And with that, I began to lose myself.

​

​

A cool morning light emanated into the forest with a gentle whisper of street sound down below. I’d become quite proud of this cozy cot I’d built from the poor, ugly, grey, revolting, and generally revolting place I had found shortly after moving to Colorado. My mind bounced around the general worries that were set to bother me daily: rent, work, Mom, Abuelo, but today stuck most on Haden.

​

“He’s out of his mind,” I said aloud to myself while putting a stroke of red on the canvas in front of me. The painting I had started just a few days earlier, progress had begun to degrade with the slipping of my focus, and in a fit of frustration, I threw my brush down into the water cup and stood. Looking out my window, I got control of my breath and glanced down at my phone. *He hasn’t texted all day.* Haden and I usually kept pretty decent contact over days in which we didn’t see each other at work, but never had I been left on hold for so long on such a serious moment. After the previous night in which Haden stumbled over a conversation with a glazed look, I had a terrible dream that I just could not quite remember, and this silence was worrying me even further.

​

“Haden, Haden, if you’re asleep, I’m sorry for bothering you, but I need to hear from you, please,” I spoke into the lower end of my house phone. There had been times in which messages floated on for a few hours, but never had Haden ever left that phone to ring. My heart dropped further when it did. I threw my phone across the room and instinctively bit my nails, thinking of my next move. *You’re acting crazy, Julie. He’s just out of the house. He’s good.* I tried to tell myself, but the image of his face last night just kept appearing. In a flash, I had whipped my coat off the rack and was walking swiftly down the stairs to the bottom floor.

​

The day was warmer than it had been yesterday, but the wind still found its way in, piercing my bones. As I walked, the thoughts of Haden wriggled in my mind and drove me down a rabbit hole of memory. How long it seemed we had known each other despite only being acquainted for a few months. I thought of the first time he came into that pharmacy job and introduced himself in that more than slightly off way of his. He was weird, but I liked it.

​

Summer lights flashed in my mind and took me back to a moment I tried to push out, but at this time, I could not possibly manage to guard myself against. It had been sprinkling all day, but broke out into a downpour in the moment when he and I had no cover. He grabbed my hand and broke out into a sprint. I followed. We laughed the entire way back to my apartment.

​

“Come on! You’re going way too slow!” He laughed, looking back at me. At that time, I saw something in that face and his grip on my hand that should have made me worry. I know now I was just too lost in the moment to do anything but if I had? Would things have been better since? *Would things be better now?*

​

We had reached the front steps of my apartment, still giggling and carrying on like children. I climbed the first few steps and turned to look back at him. I’m sure by where my head was positioned, my features were mostly dark, standing right in line with the single yellowish bulb above us, but to me, everything about him was illuminated, including that look on his face.

​

“Julie, I know it hasn’t been a long time-” He began reaching into his coat, and I felt a horror in my gut, as if watching a freight train approach while tied down on the tracks. A mess of assorted, crumpled, beautiful flowers clutched in his hands as he looked up at my featureless face and smiled uncertainly.

​

“Haden, please.”

​

“I know we’ve talked about this before, but I cannot help myself. You’ve meant everything to me in the time we’ve known each other. If they don’t mean anything, then they don’t, but please take them.” His eyes shifted now to a desperation that brought up some sympathy and nearly had me reach out to accept, but the looming dread I had tried to push back in tandem with my feelings all night burst forward instead.

​

“You know I cannot.” He reeled back slightly, the look of desperation changing to one of hurt and confusion. “I already told you how I feel, and you know how hard it's been for me to come to terms with.”

​

“But if we both feel the same, then why should it be wrong?” He pleaded.

​

“You want to start something now when you know I won’t be here in five months? My mom and abuelo need me, so I’m sorry, but you cannot be doing this to me right now.” I stared down coldly at his face, which cracked and broke under the light pathetically. Those lines on his face and bags under his eyes deepened with his growing emotion.

​

“I’m sorry, I hope you have a good night.” He turned and started walking away. I took in a deep breath and nearly felt myself belt out a call after him, but stopped myself. After that, it was quiet between us for a while, but it did not stop us from regaining a semblance of what we had. Now I stood in front of his door and stared through the dark eye hole.

​

I began a firm wrap on the door and felt a part of myself sink when, on the first strike, the door breezed open. I stared into the dark home and calculated my next move with a panicking ache in my chest.

​

“Haden! I’m coming in!” I took a meager step forward and looked around for a light switch of some kind, but there was not one. *Where are you?* Looking through the dark halls, I began to notice something strange. The apartment looked to be far too large to possibly fit within the bounds of the floor. I had never been to Haden's apartment, but he had never mentioned living in some kind of suite. Not to mention from what I could remember, two neighboring doors should have started rooms in the vicinity where I currently walked. A sickly feeling started coming over me just as I noticed something that froze me still. In the farthest corner of the room I had been walking through for the past fifteen or so seconds, or so stood a dark figure which faced the wall completely still. I tried to take a step back or speak or something, but nothing would come. What I had was the draining feeling that slipped into my consciousness. My legs began to fail, and I fell to the ground. Expecting the hard strike of the floor beneath me, I felt something arguably worse when a pair of arms caught me and eased me down slowly. Trying to speak all I could manage was a choked sputter that took in dirty air, thick and foul-smelling.

​

“Please just rest. It’s already been set in motion.” My eyes nearly bulged out of my head. The voice was deep and grating. Again, I tried to move or do anything, but my fading mind would not allow me. My vision grew blacker and blacker until all that remained was my feeling of the cool ground, and a warm trickle dripped across my body soon after. I felt the emotion burning out of me. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cry, but like this, I continued until even touch left me.

​

The light was blinding and made everything incomprehensible for more than a moment. Several pairs of hands grabbed at me and pulled me towards it. I shrieked.

​

“Ma’am, please, are you hurt?” My vision began to come back. All around me, police officers swarmed the building, which was now the cramped apartment building I had imagined I would be walking into originally. The place was covered in blood.

​

“I’m okay, I think,” I sputtered out. My throat was dry, and it pained me to speak. I lifted my hand to feel it for lumps, but discovered something crusting on it instead. I looked down and shrieked again.

​

“Ma’am, please! Just keep walking!” They had been ushering me out of the house the entire time since my wake, but were brought to a dead halt when my knees buckled, and I had to be lifted. Blood streamed down my entire body, some still wet, other parts sticking firmly to my skin and jeans.

​

“What is this? Where is he?” I jerked my head around and caught a glimpse of the source of the horror. In the kitchen, Haden lay. His wrists were not just slit but flayed open in a grotesque, impossible symmetry. “WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT DID THEY DO TO HIM?” I screamed out, but the officers continued pushing me forward against my will. I screamed all the way to the police car, which they sat me down in and attempted to calm me.

​

“Just please sit here for a moment, please!” I did, sitting with my legs hanging out of the door, two officers standing right in front of me. They asked me various questions, expected things, trying to find any information on the bizarre tragedy. I could see the horror in their faces through my tears. They didn’t know a damn thing, and they weren’t going to get a lick of information out of me. Not now, I could not bear to speak about whatever it was. I think they knew I wasn’t telling them everything, but they did not continue to press the mess of a girl in front of them. Even still, they did me a favor and drove me home. Walking up the steps, I felt a horror so strong that for a moment I thought I would not make it. The rest I remember very little of, but in a matter of time, the blood was cleaned off, and I was lying in my bed, staring emptily at the ceiling. Sleep came eventually, but not fast enough.

​

The sun was hot and prickled my skin, which was darker than it had ever been since I moved. *Texas?* I sat up with a speed that strained my muscles and made me wince. I was back. The place I feared I might never see again, I was at my mother's home. I got up from my bed and stepped around my bedroom, which was covered with the same corny band posters and stuffed animals that I had left it with.

​

“Mom? Abuelo?” I opened my door and called out. It was quiet. “Hey, guys! I’m home!” But could it really be? I didn’t remember anything about a trip. Not the hours upon hours of driving, not the stops at the dirty gas stations, not the chill of the wind outside, going to a beating heat from the sun above. ”Guys?” I called out again, stepping further into the home which basked in an idealistic, yellow light.

​

“Julie.” The voice came softly and made me jerk my head. I looked around, and my eyes bulged.

​

“Who was that? Who said that?” I called out, becoming progressively louder. Swiftly, I investigated, looking for what it was that I had heard. The voice was quiet and raspy, but I knew that I knew it from somewhere. Not here, though, not in my home.

​

“Why did you let go?” I bolted out my hand and struck the wall behind me, expecting a person, but once again, nothing. I keeled over, clutching my injured digits and screaming out.

​

“WHO THE HELL IS IT!” My voice echoed in the empty house, and my nerves started breaking down until I saw something out of the corner of my eye.

​

A grey hue formed just off in the corner of my living room. I looked straight at it and could not make anything of it at first, gasping violently when the figure took form. I walked towards the figure, which took me far too long to recognize, something I felt came from the out-of-place nature.

​

“Haden? Why are you here? How are you back?” But he did not respond, standing still like a photo without color. I could not even tell if he looked at me with his eyes blacked out through the fog.

​

“You.” whispered in my ears and I screamed out and fell to the ground, clutching my head. The voice returned in a chorus of hundreds and sent me spiraling.

​

“WHAT IS THIS? GET OUT!” I screamed indiscriminately, still clutching my head.

​

“You should not have let him go, Julie,” the hundreds of whispers called out once again. I stood angrily and looked into the vague spirit before me. Looking into his hollowed-out eyes, I turned to view the direction he gazed in and cried out a little, seeing the horror. Out the window yellow light no longer emanated; all had turned to grey as the visitors who waited outside. Walking up closer, I got a better look at the crowd standing dozens of meters outside my home, all standing still with their hazy, grey complexions.

​

“You people are crazy! He had no right to me! Neither do you! GET OUT! LEAVE!” I screamed out the window, tearing up my throat and becoming raspy in the process.

​

“You will see your mistakes soon. All will wash away when you become one with us.” As the voices came, their lips moved in perfect synchronization, bringing a sickness to my stomach. “He did not think he owed his mother a thing either when he left her in that home to die all by herself, wishing every day her son would come visit her.”

​

“That's bullshit! He told me about her abuse. He worked tirelessly to get into University and the whole time she offered him not a bit of support, degrading him all the way!”

​

“Is that what he told you? Then would you expect his soul to act accordingly?” Suddenly, the chorus of voices went silent and transformed into a single, elderly woman's voice.

​

“Haden! Come back to me, Haden!” The voice moaned out, and it took me little time to see where it came from. The woman who stood in the middle of the pack had flaming red eyes that shone and gleamed with a fury that sent a hot streak down my body. Hearing shuffling behind me, I turned to witness Haden’s form lurch forward and begin desperately crawling towards the window.

​

“You did this to him. You witnessed your own issues and saw none of what your fellow man needed. Just as his mother needed from her father, and just as you will one day soon need from your baby sister who leaves you to rot with your mother after the passing of your dear abuelo.” I looked back at the mass and discovered the landscape had changed to a blood red lake that sent my gut turning with the words. I watched helplessly as Haden climbed out the window and sank into the blood. Lower and lower he dived through the landscape until the very top of his head vanished through it. Hot tears flowed down my face, and for a moment, I felt an urge to push forward and pull him out, but something told me if I did, I would never come out. The voices of the individuals outside continued whispering indiscriminately, clouding my vision and thoughts until suddenly, with a deep breath, everything went silent. My eyes closed, and a purple beam shot through my inner mind, guiding me.

​

“That’s all bullshit, and I think you know it.” I opened my eyes and stared defiantly into the face of the beast, which had formed from the hundreds of faces into a kind of snarling dog with angry, bloody eyes. “You may have been able to fool them, and dammit, you may have been able to fool Haden, keeping him from sleeping with what it is you do here, but that will not be happening today.”

​

“You are a fool to think such things. Living in a cold apartment all alone, you may think yourself independent to no end, but once you return to your family and feel the sting of rejection, you too will give in.” The beast rose out of the blood ocean, creating a tidal wave in its wake.

​

“Maybe so, I guess we’ll just have to see, won’t we?” The beast opened its mouth, but before it could utter its last. *words? Cry? Bellow?* I returned to the land of the living.



Three

​

It has been three months since the day of that first dream. In that time, every attempt at sleep has resulted in the beast, the people, Haden, and my mother all coming to me, but still I wake rested. I sometimes wonder what it is that has allowed me to guard myself against the things which harass my dreams but I have done nothing to take it for granted. *The purple beam.* I think of it often, and it happens to be my leading theory on my stability, but I cannot prove anything. Whatever it may be, I choose to believe there is something that sets me apart from the others who were afflicted by these ghosts in my head. *Haden would not have known the rules of his condition, and still involved me.* I could not accept such a truth, but if all works as I plan, I will never have to find out.

​

In the past three months I’ve moved somewhere far away that, truthfully, I could not even provide stable directions to. Traveling down the highways of the American west I lost myself in the directionlessness and eventually found my way somewhere even colder than Colorado at its worst. I guess I may have found myself somewhere nearing the Canadian border, but this is not an invitation to come looking for me. These things in my head are violent and worse, hold on tight, they want me to too, but I won’t give in. I won’t drag them down with me. If this is a battle I must face, then it will be alone.

​

The spiders ran across the shelf with a speed that I found both grotesque and beautiful. On one hand, their grace and control were surely unmatched by any other living creature (at least dwelling in this home), but on the other, they possessed no muscle, no blood, no life? *Surely they did, if only for a moment.* I thought as I mashed down on them swiftly.

​

The things were big but not large enough that I was uncomfortable mashing down on them with my bare hand, though one was in fact quite large and nearly made me consider bringing out the swatter. Very quickly after squishing the thing, I wished I had never even touched the thing, as when I lifted my hand, a million babies scattered all across the shelf. Lifting my hand, I screamed out, tilting back foolishly and very quickly losing all balance. At the time, I stood on a rotating chair, which I had to keep supreme balance to even think of operating on. In my shock, I forgot this simple fact and found myself crashing to the ground at a vicious speed. Trying to find my landing, my arm shot out at an awkward angle and crunched loudly upon impact. Screaming out in crackling pain, there was no one to hear me. I lived alone, and I had for a very long time.

​

Sitting in that chair the next day with my scrawny arm packed tightly into a bright pink cast I cursed myself endlessly as I attempted to type out the remainder of the email I set out to compose to my pharmacy job as to why I would not be coming in. Leaning back I tilted in the chair and my eyes turned to the top shelf which I had been fiddling around at the time of the cataclysmic incident. *Those things won’t be babies for long.* My skin crawled, and I bolted up, looking intensely at my computer screen. *I won’t have my job for long if I keep this up.*

​

For the next twenty minutes or so, I typed away to the best of my ability, attempting to calibrate my reasoning as tightly as possible to escape any kind of repercussion. My job as a pharmacy aide was all I had going for me during my schooling at the University of Colorado, and single-handedly kept my food, water, and housing afloat while my grades slipped further and further down the drain. School and a job were enough to keep me stressed to the bone but what really made me fail at both was a lot deeper than the stress that either commitment could hope to bring. After my arm was put into a steady position and I awaited further treatment, I tried with every ounce of my being to avoid suspicion of anything else being wrong with me, though I do not think I did a very good job. My nurse asked questions endlessly about my habits, diet, activity levels, and… my sleep schedule. This five-foot-nothing pale girl was no kind of intimidating figure, but still, my palms sweated attempting to lie about what I now just considered a fact of life.

​

“Eight hours! Seven on a busy day,” I told her brightly, but knew my gray complexion and deep eye bags told a different story.

​

The girl nodded and moved on with the exam, but it was clear as day she did not believe me. The truth was, I did not sleep. I did not sleep, and I had not for the last six months or so. The nurse continued her examination, and I only half followed along; the rest of my brain was stuck in a haze as it usually was and as I supposed it always would be, at least if things continued like this.

​

“Sir?” The nurse had asked me when my haze reached its deepest depths.

​

“Yez, Ma’am?” I shot up and looked at her with greater clarity.

​

“I asked you if you are currently prescribed any medications.”

​

“Oh no, not since I was a little kid. ADHD had me bad as a boy.” She nodded quietly as she wrote. *Oh yeah, she thinks I’m off something for sure. Never seen a man coming up on two hundred days without catching Z’s.*

​

Since then, the constant intake of pain medication has been bringing my consciousness even further into oblivion, which I’m sure reflected in my email to my work. *Oh well, this is just going to have to do.* And after a brief skim, it was submitted. Taking in a deep breath of air, I felt my body rattle and ache. *The human body really is so fragile, and I’m sure my ‘condition’ doesn’t make it much better.* My head slunk back, and gaze toward the yellowing ceiling in my cheap one-bedroom apartment. Feeling an urge that was ever so familiar, my eyes began to flutter, and with it, my consciousness drifted. Usually, when this happens, I’ve been able to raise myself out of it with swift movement or an energy drink of some sorts but I guess it all just slipped away in the moment with all the meds and such.

​

The jewels and diamonds that covered my body were extravagant beyond belief, and I felt a thumping begin in my chest. *Could it really be? All of this? Just for me?* I clutched the objects of wealth around me and brought as many of them onto my person as possible. Right now, I appeared to be in some kind of bright hallway which led to nowhere, but after a moment of walking, I could see that this was not true. A door appeared dimly in the distance, and I picked up the pace to reach it. Finally touching it, I had to relinquish a number of my newly acquired jewels in order to free up enough space to open the door, but once I did, I was immediately glad I did.

Inside was my childhood home. And if not that, then a damn good replica of it. Stepping through, I immediately remembered the sweet scent that I would enjoy from the Sunday morning baking put on by my mother. *Mother.* Whipping my head around from the kitchen, I turned to face the open wall to the living room. Standing there was my mother. The woman who had raised me stood tall in the golden sunlight passing through the blinds in relation to their pattern, but despite this, her figure was entirely grey. The clothes, her skin, her hair, all of it was void of color. On top of all of this, her eyes, which usually had a warm dark brown appearance, were black and completely out of sight.

​

“Mother?” I called out to her with terrible uncertainty.

​

“Yes?” Her voice whispered right in my ear, and I jerked violently away to look to my side and saw nothing. Looking back to the living room, my mother was now gone, replaced by a splotch of grey where she had once stood. Heart beating fast, I walked towards the dark air and looked into it deeply.

​

“What the hell is this? Where are you?” I called into it. Slowly, I reached out to touch the thing, my hand shaking.

​

“Don’t,” the voice sounded right by my ear, and I swerved hard, straining something in my neck from the sheer speed of my reaction.

​

“What the fuck is this?” I screamed.

​

Desperately, I looked around for any solid source of the sound. Then, with a slowness that seemed to last an eternity, I felt a cold breath slowly hit my ear.

​

“You remember what you did, and I just can’t forgive it, baby.” I picked up the lamp on the coffee table, which had existed there my entire childhood, and smashed it into the wall in the direction of the voice.

​

“Shut up! SHUT THE FUCK UP!” I screamed, my voice breaking as I did. Cold sweat ran down my face, and my eyes bounced around the room. Quickly, I began turning my head, attempting to find something, anything. Then, with a quickness and volume that split my head like a melon, laughter ensued all across the room. Echoing into my mind and through my bones.

​

“You don’t see me, but I see you. YOU DON’T SEE ME, BUT I SEE YOU!” Her voice screamed out, and I shrieked. Falling to the ground, I banged my knees hard as I did.

​

“LEAVE ME ALONE!” I shrieked again and again until a hand, feeling to be twice as long as my own, wrapped around my neck and squeezed with a frozen grip that sent me bolting upright in my bed.

​

Looking around the dark room, my heart thumped, and my breath was quick and fatigued. I looked below me and recognized my bed was absolutely drenched in sweat. *What a dream.* I thought to myself as I sighed. My six-month streak of restlessness had been broken, and it had ended in the exact way my last, much shorter, streak had.

​

“Why do you do this to me?” My voice came out weak and shattered, but I supposed it didn't matter. I was alone, wasn’t I? My room was dark, only illuminated by the beeping green light of my dvd player, so it wasn’t always possible that a masked man stood hiding in the corner waiting for me. I used to think so when I was just a boy. Staring at the light for several moments more, I eventually shoved myself back down into the bed and stared at the ceiling. *How did I get into my bed?*

​

The next morning, I walked to work with a jitter that I recognized from my first week or so of sleep deprivation. Since I unwillingly slipped away into dreams, I figured all of the early effects I believed I had built a resistance to would return. Since my time awake I had found no answers to my question about how I mysteriously traveled from my chair to my bed during my slumber, but due to the contents of my dream, I figured it was not out of the question that I had struggled there myself.

​

Walking into the pharmacy, which existed on the corner of a first-floor building, I was relieved to feel the heater was operating at maximum efficiency. From the door, I peered over the counter and recognized the very dark eyes I was looking for. Julie was a Hispanic girl who moved up from Texas, who both worked in my beloved pharmacy and attended University alongside me.

​

“Sick day yesterday?” She asked absently as she reached high to place a medicine container high above her head.

​

“Ehh, something like that,” I chuckled, and she looked back over her shoulder, dropping the medicine when her eyes reached my stylishly colored cast.

​

“Jesus Christ, what happened?” She said, now with both hands on the counter, leaning in close to get a good look.

​

“A little accident, I guess. It was really pretty embarrassing to tell you the truth.”

​

“Oh yeah? Take a tumble while playing volleyball?” She laughed, and I took notice of her dark eyes flashing up at me. On the topic of her comment, I had told her of my middle school and early high school exploits as a male volleyball player. She had not let it go since.

​

“Even worse, tipped right off a swivel chair,” I said as I passed through the door to enter behind the counter.

​

“Oh, I’m so sorry.” Her face frowned, but I saw that same spark in her eyes and laughed. She laughed with me.

​

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” she giggled, trying her best and failing to stifle herself by covering her mouth. “But c’mon, what the hell were you doing, Haden?”

​

“Trying to kill spiders if you’ll believe it.” She had picked up a newspaper to move it out of the way, but smacked my arm firmly with it at my comment.

​

“Haden! You know you’re not supposed to do that! With all these insects moving up north, we're gonna need as many of those little guys as we can get!” She turned away from me with a playful scowl, and I smiled as I walked away. There would be time for more of this later, but first, I would have to deal with the boss man. My email had not been responded to yesterday, and I knew that likely meant something malicious was brewing up in that dingy office just down the hall. As my hand rested on the door, I swallowed a thick bit of saliva that had been forming in my mouth and, in short order, had my entire five-month employment flash before my eyes.

​

Finally, building up the nerve, I meagerly opened the door and at once came into the gaze of the man whom I had been dreading all this time.

​

“I got your email, Mr. Davis. Not very professional.” The tall, collected man who stood in front of me before his desk said calmly.

​

“Uhh, yeah, I’m sorry about that. The painkillers they prescribed me had me a little loopy…” I straightened up a bit. “I still wanted to get a message out to you, Sir.”

​

“I see. I suppose I can understand an accident of such proportions and subsequent response. But are you aware of any other issues detectable in your performance as of late?” The cold words rang in my head, and I felt a sweat begin down my neck. *Shit.*

​

“Not exactly, no, Sir.” Mr. Vega breathed in shallowly and rubbed his pointer finger softly on his thumb when not speaking. *Calculating.*

​

“Well, Mr. Davis, you may not, but I *have.*” I felt myself cringe and wished more than anything else that I could just leave as quickly as possible. “You’ve always been a punctual man, I'll give you that. When it comes to getting to work on time and agreeing to work over your agreed hours, you’ve always been reliable, which is a big reason why I’ve kept you on this long. But beyond the hours, there have been long-held concerns about your *productivity*.” Mr. Vega lifted from his desk and stood taller. “General sluggishness, a lack of effort, unprofessionalism with other employees.” My face flushed. “Your excuses have done little to cover this track record.” Now he stepped forward, getting right in my face and grimacing. “So I release you from your position.” After this, he continued talking, but I could not find myself able to listen. Walking out of the room, Julie quickly met my eyes despite my attempt to evade hers.

​

“What’s up? Where are you going?” She asked, increasingly concerned as I grabbed my coat from the employee's rack and began walking towards the door.

​

“I’ll call you, I promise. I just need to get out of here.” And with that, I was whisked away into the freezing Colorado winds. Finding myself back at home, I must have stared blankly at the wall in a daze of sleepless jitters and medication for hours, as when I finally awoke from my state, it was becoming dark.

​

“If you have anything to tell me now, I suggest you do it,” I spoke out, but I really don’t know who I meant it for. Perhaps the wide variety of pills, which formed in a lavish spread across my glass table, over the last couple of hours. It wouldn't surprise me if I had mindlessly popped a couple of them, but who was keeping count anyway? My chest started feeling tight, and a cough erupted from deep within me. just when I was beginning to get a hold of it, I heard a faint whisper that made me jump and look around the cramped apartment with bulging eyes.

​

“Who was that? Who’s there?” I screamed out. Jumping to hysteria, blindingly quick in my state. The silence that followed buried itself in my mind, and every little breath that I took felt like something waiting behind the corner to assault me. My body shook and twitched with an aggressiveness that sent aches reeling across my body. In an intense and, at least by feeling, nearly fatal heart thumping, the tension peaked when the phone on the wall behind me rang, reverberating through the quiet box.

​

Rushing over to the little device, I grabbed it manically and said nothing, awaiting whoever it was to get on with it.

​

“Haden? Are you okay? I wanted to talk about what happened at work.” 

​

In just thirty minutes, we were walking down the now ever colder streets of the city, chatting regularly about our day, though I avoided what was really up, much to her notice. Over the phone, I told her it would be best if I saw her in person, and she offered to take me to dinner. In all other circumstances, I likely would have refused and told her it was *she* who would be getting taken out, but on a day like today, I accepted the kindness without question. Entering the classy spot she picked out the yellow light from the ceiling's tinted glass light illuminated her hair and dark skin in a way that distracted me from whatever she said while we took our seats.

​

“Haden, I need to know what happened today? Will you be coming in tomorrow?” I tried to meet her gaze but found myself only able to speak, looking at the wooden table in front of me.

​

“I got fired today.”

​

“What? That bastard! I’ll be talking to his ass tomorrow-”

​

“Don’t. You know I deserve it. I’ve been acting like an idiot as of late, and this was just the last straw.” I spoke meagerly, and Julie just shook her head.

​

“But your sleep! The only reason you’ve been this way has been because of that. And don’t blame that on yourself because you know that’s not true!” She sat silent for a moment as if trying to decide whether or not something was right to say. “I know you don’t like to talk about it but it’s not a coincidence this started right after your mom died-”

​

“Look, I appreciate you taking me out here like this, but I don’t want to hear this right now.” After that, Julie went quiet for some time, and in the state I was in, I honestly couldn’t tell you the contents of any bit of the rest of our conversation from that night. I’m sure I made a total ass of myself, looking like a junkie, which I figured at this point I really was now. We had split off earlier than we usually did on our walks out together and I had walked home mostly alone. Now I stood outside my door fumbling with the keys, eventually locking my brain into place enough to get the bolt to shift. Opening the door, I supposed I felt something off when I walked in, but I would recognize far too late that what I had just walked into was not the poor, dingy apartment of my present but my old home. I stepped into the home and took in a deep breath of air, walking past the kitchen and into the living room where I sat and took a deep breath. *That smell of baking.*

​

A wave of shock went through me as I began dimly coming to an awareness that something was wrong in two forty-nine, Maldaga apartments. I attempted to flick on a light, but it did nothing. Interacting physically with the environment must have been what powered my brain enough to realize exactly what was wrong, but it was too late.

​

“What the hell…” I had barely uttered these words when a shrill, ear-splitting cry burst from behind the door that I had neglected to shut. Turning swiftly, I had little time to process what came upon me. The terror was brief and sharp. And with that, I began to lose myself.

​

Two

​

A cool morning light emanated into the forest with a gentle whisper of street sound down below. I’d become quite proud of this cozy cot I’d built from the poor, ugly, grey, revolting, and generally revolting place I had found shortly after moving to Colorado. My mind bounced around the general worries that were set to bother me daily: rent, work, Mom, Abuelo, but today stuck most on Haden.

​

“He’s out of his mind,” I said aloud to myself while putting a stroke of red on the canvas in front of me. The painting I had started just a few days earlier, progress had begun to degrade with the slipping of my focus, and in a fit of frustration, I threw my brush down into the water cup and stood. Looking out my window, I got control of my breath and glanced down at my phone. *He hasn’t texted all day.* Haden and I usually kept pretty decent contact over days in which we didn’t see each other at work, but never had I been left on hold for so long on such a serious moment. After the previous night in which Haden stumbled over a conversation with a glazed look, I had a terrible dream that I just could not quite remember, and this silence was worrying me even further.

​

“Haden, Haden, if you’re asleep, I’m sorry for bothering you, but I need to hear from you, please,” I spoke into the lower end of my house phone. There had been times in which messages floated on for a few hours, but never had Haden ever left that phone to ring. My heart dropped further when it did. I threw my phone across the room and instinctively bit my nails, thinking of my next move. *You’re acting crazy, Julie. He’s just out of the house. He’s good.* I tried to tell myself, but the image of his face last night just kept appearing. In a flash, I had whipped my coat off the rack and was walking swiftly down the stairs to the bottom floor.

​

The day was warmer than it had been yesterday, but the wind still found its way in, piercing my bones. As I walked, the thoughts of Haden wriggled in my mind and drove me down a rabbit hole of memory. How long it seemed we had known each other despite only being acquainted for a few months. I thought of the first time he came into that pharmacy job and introduced himself in that more than slightly off way of his. He was weird, but I liked it.

​

Summer lights flashed in my mind and took me back to a moment I tried to push out, but at this time, I could not possibly manage to guard myself against. It had been sprinkling all day, but broke out into a downpour in the moment when he and I had no cover. He grabbed my hand and broke out into a sprint. I followed. We laughed the entire way back to my apartment.

​

“Come on! You’re going way too slow!” He laughed, looking back at me. At that time, I saw something in that face and his grip on my hand that should have made me worry. I know now I was just too lost in the moment to do anything but if I had? Would things have been better since? *Would things be better now?*

​

We had reached the front steps of my apartment, still giggling and carrying on like children. I climbed the first few steps and turned to look back at him. I’m sure by where my head was positioned, my features were mostly dark, standing right in line with the single yellowish bulb above us, but to me, everything about him was illuminated, including that look on his face.

​

“Julie, I know it hasn’t been a long time-” He began reaching into his coat, and I felt a horror in my gut, as if watching a freight train approach while tied down on the tracks. A mess of assorted, crumpled, beautiful flowers clutched in his hands as he looked up at my featureless face and smiled uncertainly.

​

“Haden, please.”

​

“I know we’ve talked about this before, but I cannot help myself. You’ve meant everything to me in the time we’ve known each other. If they don’t mean anything, then they don’t, but please take them.” His eyes shifted now to a desperation that brought up some sympathy and nearly had me reach out to accept, but the looming dread I had tried to push back in tandem with my feelings all night burst forward instead.

​

“You know I cannot.” He reeled back slightly, the look of desperation changing to one of hurt and confusion. “I already told you how I feel, and you know how hard it's been for me to come to terms with.”

​

“But if we both feel the same, then why should it be wrong?” He pleaded.

​

“You want to start something now when you know I won’t be here in five months? My mom and abuelo need me, so I’m sorry, but you cannot be doing this to me right now.” I stared down coldly at his face, which cracked and broke under the light pathetically. Those lines on his face and bags under his eyes deepened with his growing emotion.

​

“I’m sorry, I hope you have a good night.” He turned and started walking away. I took in a deep breath and nearly felt myself belt out a call after him, but stopped myself. After that, it was quiet between us for a while, but it did not stop us from regaining a semblance of what we had. Now I stood in front of his door and stared through the dark eye hole.

​

I began a firm wrap on the door and felt a part of myself sink when, on the first strike, the door breezed open. I stared into the dark home and calculated my next move with a panicking ache in my chest.

​

“Haden! I’m coming in!” I took a meager step forward and looked around for a light switch of some kind, but there was not one. *Where are you?* Looking through the dark halls, I began to notice something strange. The apartment looked to be far too large to possibly fit within the bounds of the floor. I had never been to Haden's apartment, but he had never mentioned living in some kind of suite. Not to mention from what I could remember, two neighboring doors should have started rooms in the vicinity where I currently walked. A sickly feeling started coming over me just as I noticed something that froze me still. In the farthest corner of the room I had been walking through for the past fifteen or so seconds, or so stood a dark figure which faced the wall completely still. I tried to take a step back or speak or something, but nothing would come. What I had was the draining feeling that slipped into my consciousness. My legs began to fail, and I fell to the ground. Expecting the hard strike of the floor beneath me, I felt something arguably worse when a pair of arms caught me and eased me down slowly. Trying to speak all I could manage was a choked sputter that took in dirty air, thick and foul-smelling.

​

“Please just rest. It’s already been set in motion.” My eyes nearly bulged out of my head. The voice was deep and grating. Again, I tried to move or do anything, but my fading mind would not allow me. My vision grew blacker and blacker until all that remained was my feeling of the cool ground, and a warm trickle dripped across my body soon after. I felt the emotion burning out of me. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cry, but like this, I continued until even touch left me.

​

The light was blinding and made everything incomprehensible for more than a moment. Several pairs of hands grabbed at me and pulled me towards it. I shrieked.

​

“Ma’am, please, are you hurt?” My vision began to come back. All around me, police officers swarmed the building, which was now the cramped apartment building I had imagined I would be walking into originally. The place was covered in blood.

​

“I’m okay, I think,” I sputtered out. My throat was dry, and it pained me to speak. I lifted my hand to feel it for lumps, but discovered something crusting on it instead. I looked down and shrieked again.

​

“Ma’am, please! Just keep walking!” They had been ushering me out of the house the entire time since my wake, but were brought to a dead halt when my knees buckled, and I had to be lifted. Blood streamed down my entire body, some still wet, other parts sticking firmly to my skin and jeans.

​

“What is this? Where is he?” I jerked my head around and caught a glimpse of the source of the horror. In the kitchen, Haden lay. His wrists were not just slit but flayed open in a grotesque, impossible symmetry. “WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT DID THEY DO TO HIM?” I screamed out, but the officers continued pushing me forward against my will. I screamed all the way to the police car, which they sat me down in and attempted to calm me.

​

“Just please sit here for a moment, please!” I did, sitting with my legs hanging out of the door, two officers standing right in front of me. They asked me various questions, expected things, trying to find any information on the bizarre tragedy. I could see the horror in their faces through my tears. They didn’t know a damn thing, and they weren’t going to get a lick of information out of me. Not now, I could not bear to speak about whatever it was. I think they knew I wasn’t telling them everything, but they did not continue to press the mess of a girl in front of them. Even still, they did me a favor and drove me home. Walking up the steps, I felt a horror so strong that for a moment I thought I would not make it. The rest I remember very little of, but in a matter of time, the blood was cleaned off, and I was lying in my bed, staring emptily at the ceiling. Sleep came eventually, but not fast enough.

​

The sun was hot and prickled my skin, which was darker than it had ever been since I moved. *Texas?* I sat up with a speed that strained my muscles and made me wince. I was back. The place I feared I might never see again, I was at my mother's home. I got up from my bed and stepped around my bedroom, which was covered with the same corny band posters and stuffed animals that I had left it with.

​

“Mom? Abuelo?” I opened my door and called out. It was quiet. “Hey, guys! I’m home!” But could it really be? I didn’t remember anything about a trip. Not the hours upon hours of driving, not the stops at the dirty gas stations, not the chill of the wind outside, going to a beating heat from the sun above. ”Guys?” I called out again, stepping further into the home which basked in an idealistic, yellow light.

​

“Julie.” The voice came softly and made me jerk my head. I looked around, and my eyes bulged.

​

“Who was that? Who said that?” I called out, becoming progressively louder. Swiftly, I investigated, looking for what it was that I had heard. The voice was quiet and raspy, but I knew that I knew it from somewhere. Not here, though, not in my home.

​

“Why did you let go?” I bolted out my hand and struck the wall behind me, expecting a person, but once again, nothing. I keeled over, clutching my injured digits and screaming out.

​

“WHO THE HELL IS IT!” My voice echoed in the empty house, and my nerves started breaking down until I saw something out of the corner of my eye.

​

A grey hue formed just off in the corner of my living room. I looked straight at it and could not make anything of it at first, gasping violently when the figure took form. I walked towards the figure, which took me far too long to recognize, something I felt came from the out-of-place nature.

​

“Haden? Why are you here? How are you back?” But he did not respond, standing still like a photo without color. I could not even tell if he looked at me with his eyes blacked out through the fog.

​

“You.” whispered in my ears and I screamed out and fell to the ground, clutching my head. The voice returned in a chorus of hundreds and sent me spiraling.

​

“WHAT IS THIS? GET OUT!” I screamed indiscriminately, still clutching my head.

​

“You should not have let him go, Julie,” the hundreds of whispers called out once again. I stood angrily and looked into the vague spirit before me. Looking into his hollowed-out eyes, I turned to view the direction he gazed in and cried out a little, seeing the horror. Out the window yellow light no longer emanated; all had turned to grey as the visitors who waited outside. Walking up closer, I got a better look at the crowd standing dozens of meters outside my home, all standing still with their hazy, grey complexions.

​

“You people are crazy! He had no right to me! Neither do you! GET OUT! LEAVE!” I screamed out the window, tearing up my throat and becoming raspy in the process.

​

“You will see your mistakes soon. All will wash away when you become one with us.” As the voices came, their lips moved in perfect synchronization, bringing a sickness to my stomach. “He did not think he owed his mother a thing either when he left her in that home to die all by herself, wishing every day her son would come visit her.”

​

“That's bullshit! He told me about her abuse. He worked tirelessly to get into University and the whole time she offered him not a bit of support, degrading him all the way!”

​

“Is that what he told you? Then would you expect his soul to act accordingly?” Suddenly, the chorus of voices went silent and transformed into a single, elderly woman's voice.

​

“Haden! Come back to me, Haden!” The voice moaned out, and it took me little time to see where it came from. The woman who stood in the middle of the pack had flaming red eyes that shone and gleamed with a fury that sent a hot streak down my body. Hearing shuffling behind me, I turned to witness Haden’s form lurch forward and begin desperately crawling towards the window.

​

“You did this to him. You witnessed your own issues and saw none of what your fellow man needed. Just as his mother needed from her father, and just as you will one day soon need from your baby sister who leaves you to rot with your mother after the passing of your dear abuelo.” I looked back at the mass and discovered the landscape had changed to a blood red lake that sent my gut turning with the words. I watched helplessly as Haden climbed out the window and sank into the blood. Lower and lower he dived through the landscape until the very top of his head vanished through it. Hot tears flowed down my face, and for a moment, I felt an urge to push forward and pull him out, but something told me if I did, I would never come out. The voices of the individuals outside continued whispering indiscriminately, clouding my vision and thoughts until suddenly, with a deep breath, everything went silent. My eyes closed, and a purple beam shot through my inner mind, guiding me.

​

“That’s all bullshit, and I think you know it.” I opened my eyes and stared defiantly into the face of the beast, which had formed from the hundreds of faces into a kind of snarling dog with angry, bloody eyes. “You may have been able to fool them, and dammit, you may have been able to fool Haden, keeping him from sleeping with what it is you do here, but that will not be happening today.”

​

“You are a fool to think such things. Living in a cold apartment all alone, you may think yourself independent to no end, but once you return to your family and feel the sting of rejection, you too will give in.” The beast rose out of the blood ocean, creating a tidal wave in its wake.

​

“Maybe so, I guess we’ll just have to see, won’t we?” The beast opened its mouth, but before it could utter its last. *words? Cry? Bellow?* I returned to the land of the living.



Three

​

It has been three months since the day of that first dream. In that time, every attempt at sleep has resulted in the beast, the people, Haden, and my mother all coming to me, but still I wake rested. I sometimes wonder what it is that has allowed me to guard myself against the things which harass my dreams but I have done nothing to take it for granted. *The purple beam.* I think of it often, and it happens to be my leading theory on my stability, but I cannot prove anything. Whatever it may be, I choose to believe there is something that sets me apart from the others who were afflicted by these ghosts in my head. *Haden would not have known the rules of his condition, and still involved me.* I could not accept such a truth, but if all works as I plan, I will never have to find out.

​

In the past three months I’ve moved somewhere far away that, truthfully, I could not even provide stable directions to. Traveling down the highways of the American west I lost myself in the directionlessness and eventually found my way somewhere even colder than Colorado at its worst. I guess I may have found myself somewhere nearing the Canadian border, but this is not an invitation to come looking for me. These things in my head are violent and worse, hold on tight, they want me to too, but I won’t give in. I won’t drag them down with me. If this is a battle I must face, then it will be alone.

1qsjfqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qsjfqg/espresso_machine_for_beginners_1500/,Espresso machine for beginners [$1500],"Hi! I'm looking to buy an espresso machine for my mom, who's certainly not into nerding out about coffee and getting everything dialied in just right, and measure the time and weight and whatnot during a brew. Additionally, having maintenance and cleaning be as simple as possible would be a big plus! 

She wants to make lattes at home, and it should be as simple as possible for her.

I was looking into the Ninja Luxe Cafe (Pro?) And the Breville Barista Touch (Impress?) as they both seem like they'd provide a lot of assistance with the brewing process, and grind adjustments, and they can steam milk too which is a big plus.

Afaict the Pro / Impress models don't really add too much to either? Mostly a built in tamper and some slightly bigger feature sets that I'm not sure would be useful.

I'd be leaning towards the luxe cafe for my mom, but was wondering if y'all had any advice here.

There is also an option to get her a bean-to-cup machine, but my impression from using them in offices/etc is that they don't produce great quality drinks and also idk where I'd begin to find a ""good"" one for her.

I enjoy going for walks in this beautiful city and exploring cafes/bookstores or places to eat in different neighborhoods. There’s something so special about it and I’m curious if any of you folks resonate with it. I have spent some time in Europe (just walking around and eating pastries and coffee lol) and honestly boston feels so close enough to it. 

During summers, I often go for super long bike rides in the burbs, find some nice cafe, and chit chat with the locals. It’s incredible that the people I have met so far while doing this have always been so warm and welcoming. But in winters, I would rather prefer exploring cafes in the city hehe. I’m 27M, and value meaningful friendships and good conversations. I mostly look for kindness and empathy (that’s pretty much it) while making friends, and bonus if you’re outdoorsy like me (won’t mind a lifting buddy or chat fitness). Scheduling wise, weekends work best for me. Please send me a chat if you wanna hangout (with some cafe/bookstore/restaurant recs :))",3,1769906141.0,BostonSocialClub,1,1.0,False

​

The spiders ran across the shelf with a speed that I found both grotesque and beautiful. On one hand, their grace and control were surely unmatched by any other living creature (at least dwelling in this home), but on the other, they possessed no muscle, no blood, no life? *Surely they did, if only for a moment.* I thought as I mashed down on them swiftly.

​

The things were big but not large enough that I was uncomfortable mashing down on them with my bare hand, though one was in fact quite large and nearly made me consider bringing out the swatter. Very quickly after squishing the thing, I wished I had never even touched the thing, as when I lifted my hand, a million babies scattered all across the shelf. Lifting my hand, I screamed out, tilting back foolishly and very quickly losing all balance. At the time, I stood on a rotating chair, which I had to keep supreme balance to even think of operating on. In my shock, I forgot this simple fact and found myself crashing to the ground at a vicious speed. Trying to find my landing, my arm shot out at an awkward angle and crunched loudly upon impact. Screaming out in crackling pain, there was no one to hear me. I lived alone, and I had for a very long time.

​

Sitting in that chair the next day with my scrawny arm packed tightly into a bright pink cast I cursed myself endlessly as I attempted to type out the remainder of the email I set out to compose to my pharmacy job as to why I would not be coming in. Leaning back I tilted in the chair and my eyes turned to the top shelf which I had been fiddling around at the time of the cataclysmic incident. *Those things won’t be babies for long.* My skin crawled, and I bolted up, looking intensely at my computer screen. *I won’t have my job for long if I keep this up.*

​

For the next twenty minutes or so, I typed away to the best of my ability, attempting to calibrate my reasoning as tightly as possible to escape any kind of repercussion. My job as a pharmacy aide was all I had going for me during my schooling at the University of Colorado, and single-handedly kept my food, water, and housing afloat while my grades slipped further and further down the drain. School and a job were enough to keep me stressed to the bone but what really made me fail at both was a lot deeper than the stress that either commitment could hope to bring. After my arm was put into a steady position and I awaited further treatment, I tried with every ounce of my being to avoid suspicion of anything else being wrong with me, though I do not think I did a very good job. My nurse asked questions endlessly about my habits, diet, activity levels, and… my sleep schedule. This five-foot-nothing pale girl was no kind of intimidating figure, but still, my palms sweated attempting to lie about what I now just considered a fact of life.

​

“Eight hours! Seven on a busy day,” I told her brightly, but knew my gray complexion and deep eye bags told a different story.

​

The girl nodded and moved on with the exam, but it was clear as day she did not believe me. The truth was, I did not sleep. I did not sleep, and I had not for the last six months or so. The nurse continued her examination, and I only half followed along; the rest of my brain was stuck in a haze as it usually was and as I supposed it always would be, at least if things continued like this.

​

“Sir?” The nurse had asked me when my haze reached its deepest depths.

​

“Yez, Ma’am?” I shot up and looked at her with greater clarity.

​

“I asked you if you are currently prescribed any medications.”

​

“Oh no, not since I was a little kid. ADHD had me bad as a boy.” She nodded quietly as she wrote. *Oh yeah, she thinks I’m off something for sure. Never seen a man coming up on two hundred days without catching Z’s.*

​

Since then, the constant intake of pain medication has been bringing my consciousness even further into oblivion, which I’m sure reflected in my email to my work. *Oh well, this is just going to have to do.* And after a brief skim, it was submitted. Taking in a deep breath of air, I felt my body rattle and ache. *The human body really is so fragile, and I’m sure my ‘condition’ doesn’t make it much better.* My head slunk back, and gaze toward the yellowing ceiling in my cheap one-bedroom apartment. Feeling an urge that was ever so familiar, my eyes began to flutter, and with it, my consciousness drifted. Usually, when this happens, I’ve been able to raise myself out of it with swift movement or an energy drink of some sorts but I guess it all just slipped away in the moment with all the meds and such.

​

The jewels and diamonds that covered my body were extravagant beyond belief, and I felt a thumping begin in my chest. *Could it really be? All of this? Just for me?* I clutched the objects of wealth around me and brought as many of them onto my person as possible. Right now, I appeared to be in some kind of bright hallway which led to nowhere, but after a moment of walking, I could see that this was not true. A door appeared dimly in the distance, and I picked up the pace to reach it. Finally touching it, I had to relinquish a number of my newly acquired jewels in order to free up enough space to open the door, but once I did, I was immediately glad I did.

Inside was my childhood home. And if not that, then a damn good replica of it. Stepping through, I immediately remembered the sweet scent that I would enjoy from the Sunday morning baking put on by my mother. *Mother.* Whipping my head around from the kitchen, I turned to face the open wall to the living room. Standing there was my mother. The woman who had raised me stood tall in the golden sunlight passing through the blinds in relation to their pattern, but despite this, her figure was entirely grey. The clothes, her skin, her hair, all of it was void of color. On top of all of this, her eyes, which usually had a warm dark brown appearance, were black and completely out of sight.

​

“Mother?” I called out to her with terrible uncertainty.

​

“Yes?” Her voice whispered right in my ear, and I jerked violently away to look to my side and saw nothing. Looking back to the living room, my mother was now gone, replaced by a splotch of grey where she had once stood. Heart beating fast, I walked towards the dark air and looked into it deeply.

​

“What the hell is this? Where are you?” I called into it. Slowly, I reached out to touch the thing, my hand shaking.

​

“Don’t,” the voice sounded right by my ear, and I swerved hard, straining something in my neck from the sheer speed of my reaction.

​

“What the fuck is this?” I screamed.

​

Desperately, I looked around for any solid source of the sound. Then, with a slowness that seemed to last an eternity, I felt a cold breath slowly hit my ear.

​

“You remember what you did, and I just can’t forgive it, baby.” I picked up the lamp on the coffee table, which had existed there my entire childhood, and smashed it into the wall in the direction of the voice.

​

“Shut up! SHUT THE FUCK UP!” I screamed, my voice breaking as I did. Cold sweat ran down my face, and my eyes bounced around the room. Quickly, I began turning my head, attempting to find something, anything. Then, with a quickness and volume that split my head like a melon, laughter ensued all across the room. Echoing into my mind and through my bones.

​

“You don’t see me, but I see you. YOU DON’T SEE ME, BUT I SEE YOU!” Her voice screamed out, and I shrieked. Falling to the ground, I banged my knees hard as I did.

​

“LEAVE ME ALONE!” I shrieked again and again until a hand, feeling to be twice as long as my own, wrapped around my neck and squeezed with a frozen grip that sent me bolting upright in my bed.

​

Looking around the dark room, my heart thumped, and my breath was quick and fatigued. I looked below me and recognized my bed was absolutely drenched in sweat. *What a dream.* I thought to myself as I sighed. My six-month streak of restlessness had been broken, and it had ended in the exact way my last, much shorter, streak had.

​

“Why do you do this to me?” My voice came out weak and shattered, but I supposed it didn't matter. I was alone, wasn’t I? My room was dark, only illuminated by the beeping green light of my dvd player, so it wasn’t always possible that a masked man stood hiding in the corner waiting for me. I used to think so when I was just a boy. Staring at the light for several moments more, I eventually shoved myself back down into the bed and stared at the ceiling. *How did I get into my bed?*

​

The next morning, I walked to work with a jitter that I recognized from my first week or so of sleep deprivation. Since I unwillingly slipped away into dreams, I figured all of the early effects I believed I had built a resistance to would return. Since my time awake I had found no answers to my question about how I mysteriously traveled from my chair to my bed during my slumber, but due to the contents of my dream, I figured it was not out of the question that I had struggled there myself.

​

Walking into the pharmacy, which existed on the corner of a first-floor building, I was relieved to feel the heater was operating at maximum efficiency. From the door, I peered over the counter and recognized the very dark eyes I was looking for. Julie was a Hispanic girl who moved up from Texas, who both worked in my beloved pharmacy and attended University alongside me.

​

“Sick day yesterday?” She asked absently as she reached high to place a medicine container high above her head.

​

“Ehh, something like that,” I chuckled, and she looked back over her shoulder, dropping the medicine when her eyes reached my stylishly colored cast.

​

“Jesus Christ, what happened?” She said, now with both hands on the counter, leaning in close to get a good look.

​

“A little accident, I guess. It was really pretty embarrassing to tell you the truth.”

​

“Oh yeah? Take a tumble while playing volleyball?” She laughed, and I took notice of her dark eyes flashing up at me. On the topic of her comment, I had told her of my middle school and early high school exploits as a male volleyball player. She had not let it go since.

​

“Even worse, tipped right off a swivel chair,” I said as I passed through the door to enter behind the counter.

​

“Oh, I’m so sorry.” Her face frowned, but I saw that same spark in her eyes and laughed. She laughed with me.

​

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” she giggled, trying her best and failing to stifle herself by covering her mouth. “But c’mon, what the hell were you doing, Haden?”

​

“Trying to kill spiders if you’ll believe it.” She had picked up a newspaper to move it out of the way, but smacked my arm firmly with it at my comment.

​

“Haden! You know you’re not supposed to do that! With all these insects moving up north, we're gonna need as many of those little guys as we can get!” She turned away from me with a playful scowl, and I smiled as I walked away. There would be time for more of this later, but first, I would have to deal with the boss man. My email had not been responded to yesterday, and I knew that likely meant something malicious was brewing up in that dingy office just down the hall. As my hand rested on the door, I swallowed a thick bit of saliva that had been forming in my mouth and, in short order, had my entire five-month employment flash before my eyes.

​

Finally, building up the nerve, I meagerly opened the door and at once came into the gaze of the man whom I had been dreading all this time.

​

“I got your email, Mr. Davis. Not very professional.” The tall, collected man who stood in front of me before his desk said calmly.

​

“Uhh, yeah, I’m sorry about that. The painkillers they prescribed me had me a little loopy…” I straightened up a bit. “I still wanted to get a message out to you, Sir.”

​

“I see. I suppose I can understand an accident of such proportions and subsequent response. But are you aware of any other issues detectable in your performance as of late?” The cold words rang in my head, and I felt a sweat begin down my neck. *Shit.*

​

“Not exactly, no, Sir.” Mr. Vega breathed in shallowly and rubbed his pointer finger softly on his thumb when not speaking. *Calculating.*

​

“Well, Mr. Davis, you may not, but I *have.*” I felt myself cringe and wished more than anything else that I could just leave as quickly as possible. “You’ve always been a punctual man, I'll give you that. When it comes to getting to work on time and agreeing to work over your agreed hours, you’ve always been reliable, which is a big reason why I’ve kept you on this long. But beyond the hours, there have been long-held concerns about your *productivity*.” Mr. Vega lifted from his desk and stood taller. “General sluggishness, a lack of effort, unprofessionalism with other employees.” My face flushed. “Your excuses have done little to cover this track record.” Now he stepped forward, getting right in my face and grimacing. “So I release you from your position.” After this, he continued talking, but I could not find myself able to listen. Walking out of the room, Julie quickly met my eyes despite my attempt to evade hers.

​

“What’s up? Where are you going?” She asked, increasingly concerned as I grabbed my coat from the employee's rack and began walking towards the door.

​

“I’ll call you, I promise. I just need to get out of here.” And with that, I was whisked away into the freezing Colorado winds. Finding myself back at home, I must have stared blankly at the wall in a daze of sleepless jitters and medication for hours, as when I finally awoke from my state, it was becoming dark.

​

“If you have anything to tell me now, I suggest you do it,” I spoke out, but I really don’t know who I meant it for. Perhaps the wide variety of pills, which formed in a lavish spread across my glass table, over the last couple of hours. It wouldn't surprise me if I had mindlessly popped a couple of them, but who was keeping count anyway? My chest started feeling tight, and a cough erupted from deep within me. just when I was beginning to get a hold of it, I heard a faint whisper that made me jump and look around the cramped apartment with bulging eyes.

​

“Who was that? Who’s there?” I screamed out. Jumping to hysteria, blindingly quick in my state. The silence that followed buried itself in my mind, and every little breath that I took felt like something waiting behind the corner to assault me. My body shook and twitched with an aggressiveness that sent aches reeling across my body. In an intense and, at least by feeling, nearly fatal heart thumping, the tension peaked when the phone on the wall behind me rang, reverberating through the quiet box.

​

Rushing over to the little device, I grabbed it manically and said nothing, awaiting whoever it was to get on with it.

​

“Haden? Are you okay? I wanted to talk about what happened at work.” 

​

In just thirty minutes, we were walking down the now ever colder streets of the city, chatting regularly about our day, though I avoided what was really up, much to her notice. Over the phone, I told her it would be best if I saw her in person, and she offered to take me to dinner. In all other circumstances, I likely would have refused and told her it was *she* who would be getting taken out, but on a day like today, I accepted the kindness without question. Entering the classy spot she picked out the yellow light from the ceiling's tinted glass light illuminated her hair and dark skin in a way that distracted me from whatever she said while we took our seats.

​

“Haden, I need to know what happened today? Will you be coming in tomorrow?” I tried to meet her gaze but found myself only able to speak, looking at the wooden table in front of me.

​

“I got fired today.”

​

“What? That bastard! I’ll be talking to his ass tomorrow-”

​

“Don’t. You know I deserve it. I’ve been acting like an idiot as of late, and this was just the last straw.” I spoke meagerly, and Julie just shook her head.

​

“But your sleep! The only reason you’ve been this way has been because of that. And don’t blame that on yourself because you know that’s not true!” She sat silent for a moment as if trying to decide whether or not something was right to say. “I know you don’t like to talk about it but it’s not a coincidence this started right after your mom died-”

​

“Look, I appreciate you taking me out here like this, but I don’t want to hear this right now.” After that, Julie went quiet for some time, and in the state I was in, I honestly couldn’t tell you the contents of any bit of the rest of our conversation from that night. I’m sure I made a total ass of myself, looking like a junkie, which I figured at this point I really was now. We had split off earlier than we usually did on our walks out together and I had walked home mostly alone. Now I stood outside my door fumbling with the keys, eventually locking my brain into place enough to get the bolt to shift. Opening the door, I supposed I felt something off when I walked in, but I would recognize far too late that what I had just walked into was not the poor, dingy apartment of my present but my old home. I stepped into the home and took in a deep breath of air, walking past the kitchen and into the living room where I sat and took a deep breath. *That smell of baking.*

​

A wave of shock went through me as I began dimly coming to an awareness that something was wrong in two forty-nine, Maldaga apartments. I attempted to flick on a light, but it did nothing. Interacting physically with the environment must have been what powered my brain enough to realize exactly what was wrong, but it was too late.

​

“What the hell…” I had barely uttered these words when a shrill, ear-splitting cry burst from behind the door that I had neglected to shut. Turning swiftly, I had little time to process what came upon me. The terror was brief and sharp. And with that, I began to lose myself.

​

Two

​

A cool morning light emanated into the forest with a gentle whisper of street sound down below. I’d become quite proud of this cozy cot I’d built from the poor, ugly, grey, revolting, and generally revolting place I had found shortly after moving to Colorado. My mind bounced around the general worries that were set to bother me daily: rent, work, Mom, Abuelo, but today stuck most on Haden.

​

“He’s out of his mind,” I said aloud to myself while putting a stroke of red on the canvas in front of me. The painting I had started just a few days earlier, progress had begun to degrade with the slipping of my focus, and in a fit of frustration, I threw my brush down into the water cup and stood. Looking out my window, I got control of my breath and glanced down at my phone. *He hasn’t texted all day.* Haden and I usually kept pretty decent contact over days in which we didn’t see each other at work, but never had I been left on hold for so long on such a serious moment. After the previous night in which Haden stumbled over a conversation with a glazed look, I had a terrible dream that I just could not quite remember, and this silence was worrying me even further.

​

“Haden, Haden, if you’re asleep, I’m sorry for bothering you, but I need to hear from you, please,” I spoke into the lower end of my house phone. There had been times in which messages floated on for a few hours, but never had Haden ever left that phone to ring. My heart dropped further when it did. I threw my phone across the room and instinctively bit my nails, thinking of my next move. *You’re acting crazy, Julie. He’s just out of the house. He’s good.* I tried to tell myself, but the image of his face last night just kept appearing. In a flash, I had whipped my coat off the rack and was walking swiftly down the stairs to the bottom floor.

​

The day was warmer than it had been yesterday, but the wind still found its way in, piercing my bones. As I walked, the thoughts of Haden wriggled in my mind and drove me down a rabbit hole of memory. How long it seemed we had known each other despite only being acquainted for a few months. I thought of the first time he came into that pharmacy job and introduced himself in that more than slightly off way of his. He was weird, but I liked it.

​

Summer lights flashed in my mind and took me back to a moment I tried to push out, but at this time, I could not possibly manage to guard myself against. It had been sprinkling all day, but broke out into a downpour in the moment when he and I had no cover. He grabbed my hand and broke out into a sprint. I followed. We laughed the entire way back to my apartment.

​

“Come on! You’re going way too slow!” He laughed, looking back at me. At that time, I saw something in that face and his grip on my hand that should have made me worry. I know now I was just too lost in the moment to do anything but if I had? Would things have been better since? *Would things be better now?*

​

We had reached the front steps of my apartment, still giggling and carrying on like children. I climbed the first few steps and turned to look back at him. I’m sure by where my head was positioned, my features were mostly dark, standing right in line with the single yellowish bulb above us, but to me, everything about him was illuminated, including that look on his face.

​

“Julie, I know it hasn’t been a long time-” He began reaching into his coat, and I felt a horror in my gut, as if watching a freight train approach while tied down on the tracks. A mess of assorted, crumpled, beautiful flowers clutched in his hands as he looked up at my featureless face and smiled uncertainly.

​

“Haden, please.”

​

“I know we’ve talked about this before, but I cannot help myself. You’ve meant everything to me in the time we’ve known each other. If they don’t mean anything, then they don’t, but please take them.” His eyes shifted now to a desperation that brought up some sympathy and nearly had me reach out to accept, but the looming dread I had tried to push back in tandem with my feelings all night burst forward instead.

​

“You know I cannot.” He reeled back slightly, the look of desperation changing to one of hurt and confusion. “I already told you how I feel, and you know how hard it's been for me to come to terms with.”

​

“But if we both feel the same, then why should it be wrong?” He pleaded.

​

“You want to start something now when you know I won’t be here in five months? My mom and abuelo need me, so I’m sorry, but you cannot be doing this to me right now.” I stared down coldly at his face, which cracked and broke under the light pathetically. Those lines on his face and bags under his eyes deepened with his growing emotion.

​

“I’m sorry, I hope you have a good night.” He turned and started walking away. I took in a deep breath and nearly felt myself belt out a call after him, but stopped myself. After that, it was quiet between us for a while, but it did not stop us from regaining a semblance of what we had. Now I stood in front of his door and stared through the dark eye hole.

​

I began a firm wrap on the door and felt a part of myself sink when, on the first strike, the door breezed open. I stared into the dark home and calculated my next move with a panicking ache in my chest.

​

“Haden! I’m coming in!” I took a meager step forward and looked around for a light switch of some kind, but there was not one. *Where are you?* Looking through the dark halls, I began to notice something strange. The apartment looked to be far too large to possibly fit within the bounds of the floor. I had never been to Haden's apartment, but he had never mentioned living in some kind of suite. Not to mention from what I could remember, two neighboring doors should have started rooms in the vicinity where I currently walked. A sickly feeling started coming over me just as I noticed something that froze me still. In the farthest corner of the room I had been walking through for the past fifteen or so seconds, or so stood a dark figure which faced the wall completely still. I tried to take a step back or speak or something, but nothing would come. What I had was the draining feeling that slipped into my consciousness. My legs began to fail, and I fell to the ground. Expecting the hard strike of the floor beneath me, I felt something arguably worse when a pair of arms caught me and eased me down slowly. Trying to speak all I could manage was a choked sputter that took in dirty air, thick and foul-smelling.

​

“Please just rest. It’s already been set in motion.” My eyes nearly bulged out of my head. The voice was deep and grating. Again, I tried to move or do anything, but my fading mind would not allow me. My vision grew blacker and blacker until all that remained was my feeling of the cool ground, and a warm trickle dripped across my body soon after. I felt the emotion burning out of me. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cry, but like this, I continued until even touch left me.

​

The light was blinding and made everything incomprehensible for more than a moment. Several pairs of hands grabbed at me and pulled me towards it. I shrieked.

​

“Ma’am, please, are you hurt?” My vision began to come back. All around me, police officers swarmed the building, which was now the cramped apartment building I had imagined I would be walking into originally. The place was covered in blood.

​

“I’m okay, I think,” I sputtered out. My throat was dry, and it pained me to speak. I lifted my hand to feel it for lumps, but discovered something crusting on it instead. I looked down and shrieked again.

​

“Ma’am, please! Just keep walking!” They had been ushering me out of the house the entire time since my wake, but were brought to a dead halt when my knees buckled, and I had to be lifted. Blood streamed down my entire body, some still wet, other parts sticking firmly to my skin and jeans.

​

“What is this? Where is he?” I jerked my head around and caught a glimpse of the source of the horror. In the kitchen, Haden lay. His wrists were not just slit but flayed open in a grotesque, impossible symmetry. “WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT DID THEY DO TO HIM?” I screamed out, but the officers continued pushing me forward against my will. I screamed all the way to the police car, which they sat me down in and attempted to calm me.

​

“Just please sit here for a moment, please!” I did, sitting with my legs hanging out of the door, two officers standing right in front of me. They asked me various questions, expected things, trying to find any information on the bizarre tragedy. I could see the horror in their faces through my tears. They didn’t know a damn thing, and they weren’t going to get a lick of information out of me. Not now, I could not bear to speak about whatever it was. I think they knew I wasn’t telling them everything, but they did not continue to press the mess of a girl in front of them. Even still, they did me a favor and drove me home. Walking up the steps, I felt a horror so strong that for a moment I thought I would not make it. The rest I remember very little of, but in a matter of time, the blood was cleaned off, and I was lying in my bed, staring emptily at the ceiling. Sleep came eventually, but not fast enough.

​

The sun was hot and prickled my skin, which was darker than it had ever been since I moved. *Texas?* I sat up with a speed that strained my muscles and made me wince. I was back. The place I feared I might never see again, I was at my mother's home. I got up from my bed and stepped around my bedroom, which was covered with the same corny band posters and stuffed animals that I had left it with.

​

“Mom? Abuelo?” I opened my door and called out. It was quiet. “Hey, guys! I’m home!” But could it really be? I didn’t remember anything about a trip. Not the hours upon hours of driving, not the stops at the dirty gas stations, not the chill of the wind outside, going to a beating heat from the sun above. ”Guys?” I called out again, stepping further into the home which basked in an idealistic, yellow light.

​

“Julie.” The voice came softly and made me jerk my head. I looked around, and my eyes bulged.

​

“Who was that? Who said that?” I called out, becoming progressively louder. Swiftly, I investigated, looking for what it was that I had heard. The voice was quiet and raspy, but I knew that I knew it from somewhere. Not here, though, not in my home.

​

“Why did you let go?” I bolted out my hand and struck the wall behind me, expecting a person, but once again, nothing. I keeled over, clutching my injured digits and screaming out.

​

“WHO THE HELL IS IT!” My voice echoed in the empty house, and my nerves started breaking down until I saw something out of the corner of my eye.

​

A grey hue formed just off in the corner of my living room. I looked straight at it and could not make anything of it at first, gasping violently when the figure took form. I walked towards the figure, which took me far too long to recognize, something I felt came from the out-of-place nature.

​

“Haden? Why are you here? How are you back?” But he did not respond, standing still like a photo without color. I could not even tell if he looked at me with his eyes blacked out through the fog.

​

“You.” whispered in my ears and I screamed out and fell to the ground, clutching my head. The voice returned in a chorus of hundreds and sent me spiraling.

​

“WHAT IS THIS? GET OUT!” I screamed indiscriminately, still clutching my head.

​

“You should not have let him go, Julie,” the hundreds of whispers called out once again. I stood angrily and looked into the vague spirit before me. Looking into his hollowed-out eyes, I turned to view the direction he gazed in and cried out a little, seeing the horror. Out the window yellow light no longer emanated; all had turned to grey as the visitors who waited outside. Walking up closer, I got a better look at the crowd standing dozens of meters outside my home, all standing still with their hazy, grey complexions.

​

“You people are crazy! He had no right to me! Neither do you! GET OUT! LEAVE!” I screamed out the window, tearing up my throat and becoming raspy in the process.

​

“You will see your mistakes soon. All will wash away when you become one with us.” As the voices came, their lips moved in perfect synchronization, bringing a sickness to my stomach. “He did not think he owed his mother a thing either when he left her in that home to die all by herself, wishing every day her son would come visit her.”

​

“That's bullshit! He told me about her abuse. He worked tirelessly to get into University and the whole time she offered him not a bit of support, degrading him all the way!”

​

“Is that what he told you? Then would you expect his soul to act accordingly?” Suddenly, the chorus of voices went silent and transformed into a single, elderly woman's voice.

​

“Haden! Come back to me, Haden!” The voice moaned out, and it took me little time to see where it came from. The woman who stood in the middle of the pack had flaming red eyes that shone and gleamed with a fury that sent a hot streak down my body. Hearing shuffling behind me, I turned to witness Haden’s form lurch forward and begin desperately crawling towards the window.

​

“You did this to him. You witnessed your own issues and saw none of what your fellow man needed. Just as his mother needed from her father, and just as you will one day soon need from your baby sister who leaves you to rot with your mother after the passing of your dear abuelo.” I looked back at the mass and discovered the landscape had changed to a blood red lake that sent my gut turning with the words. I watched helplessly as Haden climbed out the window and sank into the blood. Lower and lower he dived through the landscape until the very top of his head vanished through it. Hot tears flowed down my face, and for a moment, I felt an urge to push forward and pull him out, but something told me if I did, I would never come out. The voices of the individuals outside continued whispering indiscriminately, clouding my vision and thoughts until suddenly, with a deep breath, everything went silent. My eyes closed, and a purple beam shot through my inner mind, guiding me.

​

“That’s all bullshit, and I think you know it.” I opened my eyes and stared defiantly into the face of the beast, which had formed from the hundreds of faces into a kind of snarling dog with angry, bloody eyes. “You may have been able to fool them, and dammit, you may have been able to fool Haden, keeping him from sleeping with what it is you do here, but that will not be happening today.”

​

“You are a fool to think such things. Living in a cold apartment all alone, you may think yourself independent to no end, but once you return to your family and feel the sting of rejection, you too will give in.” The beast rose out of the blood ocean, creating a tidal wave in its wake.

​

“Maybe so, I guess we’ll just have to see, won’t we?” The beast opened its mouth, but before it could utter its last. *words? Cry? Bellow?* I returned to the land of the living.



Three

​

It has been three months since the day of that first dream. In that time, every attempt at sleep has resulted in the beast, the people, Haden, and my mother all coming to me, but still I wake rested. I sometimes wonder what it is that has allowed me to guard myself against the things which harass my dreams but I have done nothing to take it for granted. *The purple beam.* I think of it often, and it happens to be my leading theory on my stability, but I cannot prove anything. Whatever it may be, I choose to believe there is something that sets me apart from the others who were afflicted by these ghosts in my head. *Haden would not have known the rules of his condition, and still involved me.* I could not accept such a truth, but if all works as I plan, I will never have to find out.

​

In the past three months I’ve moved somewhere far away that, truthfully, I could not even provide stable directions to. Traveling down the highways of the American west I lost myself in the directionlessness and eventually found my way somewhere even colder than Colorado at its worst. I guess I may have found myself somewhere nearing the Canadian border, but this is not an invitation to come looking for me. These things in my head are violent and worse, hold on tight, they want me to too, but I won’t give in. I won’t drag them down with me. If this is a battle I must face, then it will be alone.

Using ImagineArt Interior Studio, I explored two different ways to bring Javanese character and elegance into the same room:

* One direction leans into classic Javanese heritage — carved wood, warm lighting, cultural depth
* The other blends traditional elements with modern design — lighter, calmer, more contemporary

Workflow:

1. Upload the empty room as reference
2. Select the room type (living room) to keep structure intact
3. Use custom prompts to define culture, materials, and atmosphere

[Prompt: Reimagine this empty living room as a contemporary Javanese living room that blends traditional cultural elements with modern minimalist design. Keep the space open and uncluttered while introducing teak wood accents, simplified Javanese patterns, and modern furniture with subtle traditional influence.

Back story for understanding 

Me (28f) and my Brother (22transm) didn't get along well growing up but once we became adults and I moved out from our mom's (48f) we became  thick as thieves.
It's important to know our parents are divorced and happened when I was super young around 8 years old. It never bothered me because even that young I knew my parents shouldn't be together. There were incidents were my parents would fight so bad the cops were called and I was integrated by police. Other days I would be put between my parents and told to ""choose"" one of them. My father (50m) would ""try"" to help me with home work, such as spelling cat or dog, and when i would mess up he would threaten to beat me till i got it right. Thankfully my mother stepped in before that happened. Keep in mind I'm around 6 at the time so before my brother was born.

After the divorce our father (50m) moved in across the street. We could literally walk over whenever we wanted it was not hard to see him. However every day and night he had people over, drinking partying playing in bands. He truly wanted to be a rock star and thought he was one. I would come over to see him and he didn't have the time for me. The few times me and my brother stayed the night we would sleep in his bed, because we didn't have one. Then we ended up with bites. Yep bed bugs. Then he had us sleep on a pool table. At least no bed bugs now right. I wish I was making this up. Anyway years go by of being brushed off ignored missing every school event with the same excuse ""I was asleep, I thought it was this day"" I stopped believing that this person cared about me so I stopped caring about reaching out.
There's obviously so many more stories here but let's get to the present, the real reason I'm writing this.

Ages to recap present: me (28f) brother (22transm) mom (48f) dad (50m)

Everything started Nov on my brothers birthday. He got a call from our aunt on our dad's side well he was at a football game performing. We don't talk to this side of the family, they dont invite us to anything they are strangers to us except our grandma. At this time ive had no contact with our dad in 5plus years. My husband (29m) hasn't even met him. Turns out our father was put in jail for domestic abuse to his current gf. Ill be honest, I laughed because it served him right for everything he did to us growing up. My brother then starts having full on conversations with our dad's side, is added to a family group chat, and even helping them clean up my father's home. Cause get this he's also getting evicted. We didn't even know he rented,  we thought he owned the house. Our father completely tore apart this house was trying to build a second story it looked like living in a construction zone. So im being told all this info from my brother because no one contacted me. Just to find out my dad's side of the family thinks I hate them because I didn't invite them to my wedding in 2024. I'm 28 and they haven't invited me to anything in all those years with 4 aunt/uncles 10+ cousins no birthdays, graduations, weddings, baby showers nothing. After talking to my grandma on my mom's side turns out she invited all of them to my graduation and not 1 showed up. 

I'm being told he's going to be in prison for 2 to 4 years. I said good maybe he'll learn. All well my brother and uncle are trying to sell everything at our father's house and dispose of all his narcotics. He was released after 10 days. My brother went and picked him up! Why idk than decided to talk to him and ask why he was doing what he was doing. Turns out my father takes meth to wake up in the morning because he doesn't like coffee 🤔 oh and he can quit at aaaaanytime. Sure. My father apparently feels like a horrible parent and wants to be better so he keeps asking to hang out with my brother all well using the incorrect pronouns for him. 

My husband and I think it's an act because he is losing everything right now

Remember how I said we still have contact with my grandma on my dad's side. We have chistmas with her in January. I haven't seen our grandma in 2 years and she personally reached out hoping we can come. So of course I said yes. Then my brother invited our dad. He's been telling our dad how amazing my husband is and how he's going to like him etc etc. The day before the party I told my brother I would be civil with our father but to let him know I do not want to be touched. My brother yelled at me and said it's just a hug. That our father is trying and he will give a chance to anyone who tries no matter how terrible they are. I said I have boundaries. His response was old people don't understand boundaries and I should just allow it because it would make him happy. So I tried to ask my brother if it was okie if people called him she or dead named him. He said he didn't care as long as it wasn't malicious. Which is insane to me because I have seen my brother pick fights with our mom about using the wrong pronouns. He told me to just fake it. I don't want to fake it I have boundaries I shouldn't have to set aside my boundaries to please a person I don't like and hasn't been there my entire life.

Day of the party
I'm thinking of not going because I can't handle any this. I get a call from my brother. My dad's not answering his phone and my brother was supposed to pick him up and take him to the the party. I'm already laughing inside because this is typical of our father. The end result of the day was we didn't go and rescheduled a different day for just me, my husband, my brother and my grandma dad's side. I was excited because now I didn't have to deal with my father. New day is set 3 days after the 1st party. My father called my brother back the day after the 1st party saying he was sleeping and thought it was today. Now my brother has reinvited my father to our small get together chistmas party. I feel like im losing my mind at this point why is my brother trying so hard to get me to reconnect with our dad? It's fine if he wants to but I shouldn't have to right? 

Day of the 2 attempt party
I contacted my grandma stating I do not wish to come over if my father is. I felt horrible saying that because that's her son. She said ""he's coming over? Will you come if he doesnt"" I was shocked because 1 my brother didn't tell our grandma or ask to bring our dad and 2 she was respecting my boundaries about not wanting to be around him.
Turns out my brother yet again can't get ahold of our dad. So this entire time I've been stressing over seeing someone who wasn't even gonna show up. We get to grandmas house it's wondeful great time and she said to me ""all because they are family doesn't mean you have to like them or be around them"" I could literally cry because this is the ""old person"" who doesn't understand boundaries? It feels more like my brother doesn't understand and that hurts because I feel like we've gotten so close as we matured. 

2 days after the private chirstmas party
We got information that our dad is in jail again 🤣 no idea why this time but he in jail.

Today Saturday January 31
I found out my brother became ordained so he can talk to our dad in jail. There is an inmate text messaging thing I didn't know existed and my brother has been talking to him while he's in jail. Apparently my father wants to see me and my brother sent me a screenshot saying how sweet it is that he's thinking of me. I decided to just be blunt and said ""I don't want to reconnect"" the response I got was ""k"" I said ""thank you"" and we haven't talked since then.

So I ask aitah for not wanting to reconnect even though my brother is pushing me too?",7,1769905922.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I'm a guy from Budapest. I cannot seem to find vegan women to date with in my area, so I thought I might go international. I also have few friends that shares my views, so this is not an only romantic relationship post, I'm looking for friends as well.

\-Cooking  
\-Playing guitar  
\-Rock climbing, bouldering  
\-Tai chi , meditation, and yoga

What I'm bad at:  
\-Too much internet use on some days, reading silly content, and argue with strangers sometimes instead of playing guitar or doing something more valuable  
\-I drink coffee almost every day, but want to get rid of it  
\-I sometimes forget that there is life outside of worrying about life, lol. 

More about me:   
I work as a sound engineer and mix concerts, theater, and performances as a living.   
I try to be open minded, and interested in finding out what I'm here for in this life.   
I have no exact religion, but I'm open to Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism, and any religion that seeks the truth how we can live in peace, harmony and a meaningful life.

1qsj7ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qsj7ux/moved_in_with_friend_now_she_wont_spend_time_with/,Moved in with friend now she won’t spend time with me.,"About 4 months ago I recently returned to my home city after living away for 3 years. My friend, let’s call her Rebecca asked me to move in to her place that she owned. Rebecca and I have been friends since 2019, and we met at my previous job. We didn’t speak too much when I was living in another city, however met for dinner in July just before I moved back and that’s when we first discussed me moving in. 

Now, since moving in to her place in November - Rebecca hasn’t put in any effort to hang out with me. I’ve asked her via text to go to the movies a few times, and asked if she wants to get coffee and I’ve had literally no response so I assume it’s a no. I would ask her in person if she wants to hang out, but she’s mostly spending time in her room and not in the social/common areas. 

She’s always been more introverted than me, and we are different people but we would go hang out together in the early years of our friendship. She has said to me ‘the more you ask me to go out the less likely I am to say yes.’ She’s also gotten a dog when I was living away, who can’t be alone for more than a few hours and that has been her excuse for not hanging out. 

I’ve lived in shared housing for quite a few years, and don’t need to live in my roommates pocket, I have my own life, but I do like to live in house shares where people go for dinner once a month or so, and occasionally spend social time together.

Am I being unreasonable for assuming that if you ask a friend to move in, you are going to want to spend time with them occasionally? I feel like I’m just a cash cow to pay her mortgage and I’m thinking of moving out. I feel like if I do move out, our friendship will completely end as I can’t see her reaching out if she can barely respond to me when I’m under the same roof.

1qsj5ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1qsj5ne/aiden_opus_struggling_with_consistency_on_larger/,"Aiden + Opus — struggling with consistency on larger brews (grinder, brewer, or me?)","Hey everyone, I could really use some help troubleshooting my setup because I’m burning through expensive beans and honestly getting tired

My setup:

	•	Brewer: Fellow Aiden

	•	Grinder: Fellow Opus

	•	Beans: mostly high-end  (DAK Coffee Roasters, TANAT Coffee, La Cabra)

The problem:

When I brew small batches (up to \~1.5 cups), the coffee tastes good — balanced, sweet, clear.

But once I brew larger batches, the results fall apart:

	•	harsh / hollow / muddy

	•	bitterness mixed with under-extracted sourness

	•	bad enough that I often dump the cup

I do compensate:

	•	grind coarser for larger brews

	•	adjust temperature and pulse structure

	•	use RDT, so static/retention aren’t my concern

Still, I can’t find a stable relationship between grind size, temperature, pulses, and dose beyond small brews.

Shower / basket issue (my suspicion):

I honestly think the default shower / basket logic in Aiden is wrong.

The standard Aiden program uses the single-serve basket + shower/nozzle for anything up to 3 cups. During the bloom phase, if you open the lid and look at the bed, extraction looks very uneven — parts of the coffee remain completely dry while other areas are clearly over-hit.

This makes me wonder if:

	•	water distribution simply isn’t adequate for larger doses with the single-serve shower

	•	channeling and dry pockets are baked into the default program

	•	grind adjustments alone can’t compensate for poor initial wetting

So now I’m stuck asking:

	1.	Is this primarily a shower / distribution limitation in Aiden for larger brews?

	2.	Is Opus grind consistency (especially at coarser settings) amplifying the problem?

	3.	Or is this still user error — wrong recipes or expectations on my side?

What’s frustrating is that the system can make excellent coffee — just not consistently at scale. That makes it really hard to know what to fix first.

If anyone has:

	•	experience dialing Aiden for larger batches

	•	experimented with forcing the batch basket earlier

	•	or compared Opus vs Ode Gen 2 specifically for batch brewing

…I’d really appreciate your insight. I’m not trying to start a brand war — just trying to stop wasting great coffee.",1,1769905471.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False

I’m in the middle of choosing a coffee roaster and I’m a bit stuck, so I figured I’d ask people who’ve actually used these things as I can’t make up my mind about them. 

I’m looking for something beyond pure home-hobby level. I’ll mostly roast for myself, family and friends and some small projects. I am also looking into selling locally so control, consistency and reliability matter more to me than “push one button and forget it.” I’m fine with a learning curve.

I have been roasting on a Skywalker roaster with artisan for the past year. I have gone to some roasting workshops and talked with local roasters but they all roast on gas roasters. 

I need to get something that can roast a bigger batch as roasting higher volumes with this roaster is a PAIN for me. 

Right now I’m considering:

	•	Coffee-Tech FZ94 (Pro-Lab / EVO)

	•	Aillio Bullet R2 Pro

	•	Kaleido Sniper M10

What I’m trying to figure out:

	•	Which one feels the most solid and reliable long-term?

	•	How do they compare in real-world use, not just on paper?

	•	Is the Bullet really worth the price jump over the M10?

	•	For anyone with an FZ94, how is maintenance and day-to-day use?

	•	Any “I wish I knew this before buying” moments?

The Kaleido and the Bullet will be bought as new but I can the coffee tech fz94 second-hand for under 5000 euros. 

If you own or have spent real time with any of them, I’d really appreciate hearing how it’s been for you — good, bad, or annoying little details.

I’m 22, and currently studying Biology + Industrial Engineering (focused on ecology & nutritional science). I live a structured, disciplined life, but I’m also trying to open myself to new experiences and perspectives. I’m a slim nerd, masc, Arabs–Chinese, 5'8"", and based in Indonesia.

I’m looking for a partner for long-term relationship from anywhere, I also don't mind having LDR too! as long as we get along, it’s all good. I’m into lifelong learning and real talks, so I’d love to meet people who love talking about life, ideas, and random interesting things.

For fun, I listen to pop, alternative, rock, country, classics, and folk. I read sci-fi, draw imaginary maps, and I’m a beginner at traveling. Biology fieldwork also gets me outdoors a lot, so I love exploring Indonesia’s nature. I’m also into culinary adventures and healthy living (not vegetarian), and lately I’ve been doing a lot of cardio. I had retinal detachment before so I can't do any activities that can make my eyes strained.

I also like memes, cats, PC games (Stardew Valley, Fall Guys, TheHunter, Terraria, Minecraft), horror movies, and a bit of anime (Chainsaw Man, Azumanga Daioh, Demon Slayer, Haikyuu!!, Gachiakuta, Dr. Stone, Naruto, Pokémon (I wanna rewatch this), and Doraemon!). Oh, and I love drinkinh coffee + matcha at the same time!

I value mutual respect and balanced energy. I’m a bit old-fashioned about communication and boundaries, and I’m not into adult things easily. I’m also not into hookups. I’m into phone detox and productivity too! mindful tech use, deep work/focus time, and being present offline, so it’s a plus if you relate!!

I’ve also been living with a very disciplined routine. I’m an early bird and I keep my own daily schedule and to-do list. I really try to respect my time each day because I believe life is precious, so I want to use it as wisely and meaningfully as possible.

For compatibility, I’m looking for an old-fashioned relationship with someone who feels more mature and dominant (or at least versatile-a bit dominant) in personality than me. I’d describe myself as versatile in personality, and more of a sub / power-sub in terms of intimacy. I don’t have an age preference (18+ ofc), and I don’t mind if we have totally different interests, as long as there’s mutual understanding and respect, everything will be fine.

Most importantly, I want someone who can genuinely respect, understand, accept, and appreciate each other as we are. I’m the kind of person who's ISTP and likes to grow and move forward together, and I’m also big on planning and organizing, so I hope you can understand and be comfortable with that. If you’re more extroverted, I might be a little shy at first, and if you’re more introverted, that’s totally fine too! As long as we communicate and understand each other.

If you’ve read this far and think we might vibe, please don’t just say “Hi.” Tell me a bit about yourself or ask a question 🙂",1,1769905379.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

From my perspective:

	•	Ode 2 is about 2× the price

	•	Ode 2 can’t do espresso, while Opus can (at least “espresso-capable”)

	•	I’m not worried about retention/static (I’m fine with RDT + a couple taps/slaps)

So I’m mainly trying to understand the grinding performance side:

	1.	Grind consistency / uniformity:

How different is it in real use? Is Ode 2 noticeably more uniform at common brew methods (V60, batch, AeroPress, etc.)?

	2.	Inconsistency with Opus:

Is Opus actually “that bad” in terms of grind-to-grind consistency (not adjustment ergonomics), or is it mostly internet exaggeration?

	3.	Taste in the cup:

Do you genuinely taste an improvement with Ode 2 over Opus — more clarity, sweetness, fewer astringent cups?

If yes, what brew method and what kind of coffees make it obvious?

1qsizxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_nautilvss/comments/1qsizxe/being_ignored_by_my_mother_and_sister/,being ignored by my mother and sister.,"I, 15F, am the oldest daughter out of seven siblings and while the situation I’m currently going through is potentially minor, I need advice on how I should approach this situation.

For context of my current environment, there’s a lot that I just can’t do (e.g. going places, work, drive, purchasing) and the city me and my family live in is no help. The schools do not make it any better, as they genuinely make things worse. We also do not have any family here, and we’ve moved a good amount of times so that now I do not have any friends or reliable associates I can communicate with or talk to about things like this.

That being said, I think that my mom, 38F, and my sister, 14F, are moving sketchily again. The reason I say again is because this has been a reoccurring thing where my sisters are may begin to feel some kind of way and then it quietly puts me on a back burner until further notice.

Previously, they’ve pushed me away like this but then when they stop pushing me away they feel like it’s my fault for becoming distant and when I did muster up the courage to tell them what they’re doing makes me feel unwanted, my mom began crying and saying how it hurts her feelings that I felt that way, but even then made no attempt in trying to fix it. For example, back when I was maybe 11 and 12, we stayed with my Nana and I consistently tried to give both of them hugs to which they both pushed me away. Now, I don’t want to be touched, and just two years ago made that clear when she tried to forcefully corner me and hug me. I didn’t hug her back.

There have also been many points in time where my mom specifically broke my trust, blatantly said she wouldn’t apologize, and still expect me to stay. And to my default, I have no where else to go…so I did what any other child would did when they see “love” flashing in faux material.

The rerun of both my mom and my sister’s actions against me, started a couple of weeks back before my papa fell ill (my grandfather, I mean, which has an even worse effect on how things transpire). My sister tried to force me and \[one of my other sisters who is close in age\] upstairs, claiming that it was because we “had school”, but get real. I am a teenager who can’t sleep, even on the pills, and even those I take in moderation.

But because she’s unbearably controlling, I went to bed, and the other sister I mentioned followed suit. All for not even 15 Minutes later, my sister and our mom downstairs, watching television and laughing it up.

After this, the small remarks begin.

It’s the “whatever you say.” It’s the “you can’t do….” It’s the constant correction or doubt that I can do anything. It’s the “Oh, this dish is dirty” (dishes are my chore) and proceeds to put a spotless coffee cup back inside of the sink. It’s the talking to me like I’m a baby even though I’ve explicitly told mom that I don’t like this, nor do I like to control people or be controlled in this manner, it’s not cool and it grates at my skin.

I can’t even help out with the kids without being told that I’m disagreed with in some way and then when I don’t try to help she complains that she’s the only one ever doing anything.

She doesn’t get in trouble for these things, in fact, it’s endorsed. My mom laughs at it, and then when I start correcting and begin telling her off—“It’s the end times, you two are arguing over bullshit.”

And to be real, no, I do not cook anymore. I used to love to cook and bake, now my sister does that because she wanted to. My chore was to do dishes, but she made it a big deal to me that I wasn’t doing my job the correct way, or commenting on how slowly I do it. Or whenever she got tired of “waiting” she’ll get up and tell me to get out and say stuff like, “Now, watch how I get it done in less than 25 minutes.” Boasting, as per usual.

When, I try to explain anything, or tell her what’s holding me off (after she barks out orders by the millisecond) she screams at me and tells me that I am talking back and that she has bigger problems than just me.

What really began to rub me in the wrong way was is how the last time me and mom were having a genuine conversation, my sister got mad and stormed off upstairs after mom “ignored her” while mom was clearly talking to me. After mom asked me where she was, I told her, “Went upstairs because she’s mad at you because she thinks you are ignoring her.”

My mom calls her and starts driving her, but “good-naturedly” and in my sister’s defense I “jokingly” tell my mom to stop driving her and that they’re both being difficult. My sister turns around and stands right to the side of my mom but looks her dead in her face while I’m sitting there, and expresses how mom was able to talk to me but completely ignore her when she was talking.

And then ironically, I am the one who is now being ignored because of it. First slowly, and now completely.

Personally, because of most of the rest of the kids—I don’t ever get a chance to spend time with mom without making someone else feel some kind of way.

This has also been the same way with the men my mom used to date, where I would be side-lined, or disliked by those men in defense of my mom. I’ve still been humiliated, accused, and considered last in my opinion, even though my mom says that my opinion comes first.

After that incident (my sister accusing my mom of ignoring her), mom and my sister have been closer. To the point where my sister’s every move is being praised, and she is deliberately choosing not to acknowledge any of the attempts of help that I’ve made. Then always saying I’m always on my iPad or am always distant or too independent and that’s why I don’t receive as much attention as the other kids, but what the hell am I supposed to do? We don’t have anything.

Then mom keeps sending me to my room over small shit. Another example, my sister got mad at the other sister I mentioned earlier and I had backed her up by saying that it was true, and she didn’t ever have her door open unless mine was because my room is right across from hers. Everyone got yelled at and sent to their rooms and I apologized to my sister because mom made it seem like everyone was ganging up on her, and I genuinely apologized but still got sent to my room. Or how she (sister) calls the kids stupid and dumb, but one remark from me about saying “You guys aren’t stupid,” after they continuously tried to act illiterate because they thought it was cool, I got in trouble and cussed out and told to stop saying it.

As far as everything else, they also keep demeaning everything about me. This includes my struggles, only to shine limelight on my sister and make her seem like a martyr. When my mom and sister were up, I was tossing and turning as well, but out of reverence for both of them, I stayed where I was so my sister wouldnt think I was intruding in on her and mom’s “time together.” They kept talking about us moving again, but no longer show me any of the houses or include me in any of the topics. And they’ve also made it their mission to tell my nana and themselves that I don’t do anything, I’m always in room, and told the kids that I don’t not care about our papa (grandfather, who is currently in the hospital).

I can garuntee a rats ass that they are going to blame it on me being distant, always having my headphones, or my iPad, but we can’t do anything because we don’t have anything. They’re constantly watching tv or on phones too, but it’s a problem when I do it because they don’t like when I wear my headphones and try to force me to leave one out even though when I speak to them they almost don’t acknowledge me at all.

I don’t know. I feel terrible for even feeling this envious or enraged when things with Papa are going on and it doesn’t help that even now currently, I’m sitting in this room. Am I in the wrong? How am I supposed to approach this situation head-on, instead of just playing Rapunzel (being isolated in my room) all day long? Any advice helps.",1,1769905070.0,u_nautilvss,0,1.0,False
1qsiztq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1qsiztq/if_the_walls_could_talk/,If The Walls Could Talk,"I’m really in no place to wax dramatic. I’m huddled as close to a space heater as possible without catching my eyebrows on fire, wrapped in three blankets. I’ve got a shivering purse dog clutched to my chest and the tears on my face have long since lost their warmth. But bear with me here. It’s the easiest way to put you in my shoes.

Picture your childhood bedroom, somewhere familiar. You’re laying there in the dark, and something is in your closet. The door cracks open just far enough for you to see a pair of enormous red eyes and for a pair of claws to grip the door. Naturally, you’re gonna scream for your parents, and eventually, they’re going to sleepily make it down the hall to you. They banish the monster simply by being there, pulling the closet door open and pointing at the clothes and toys and normal things. “See?” They say. “There’s no such thing as monsters.”

Now, I want you to picture instead that you’re in the closet. You’re not on neutral ground anymore; this is the monster’s domain. The door won’t open, and you can hear the heavy breaths of the beast— feel the drip of its saliva on your face. You can bang on the door, or scream, or do any number of things to escape or call for help, to struggle in the trap, but you’re nothing here. It’s only a matter of when. 

I can’t say I didn’t deserve this. I tried to tell myself that I was a good squatter. That I tried to protect her, and the house when it came down to it. But I was still an intruder, and I guess this is my karma. 

Before anyone makes any assumptions about the kind of person I am, I don’t crawl into people’s walls for sick kicks. But this dusty, creaky space between wooden beams is the only stable shelter I’ve known in years. For the record, I didn’t choose to be this desperate. I’m not on any hard drugs. Alcohol makes me violently ill. And before the things that happened in this house, I was decently sure I was of sound mind. 

My parents would tell you a different story. They’d tell you how they caught their boy Hunter, eldest son and hardest worker on their family farm, kissing another farmhand behind the grain silo. Long story short, I packed a bag at gunpoint, and then we were both forced away, to the tune of my sobbing mother and my angry father. I don’t know where that boy is now, and it doesn't matter much, but I hope he’s doing alright. 

I was only sixteen then, and  I was fucking terrified. I made my way up from the rural wasteland over the course of a few days, ending in Atlanta. I didn’t stay there long— a few months, at most.  All I can say is, I hold no blame for the people who turn to substances to cope with life on the streets. And that I would’ve rather died than stay there, starving and sleeping in the gutter. So, I snuck on a Greyhound, resolving to go wherever it took me. 

I traced a red line from the Southeast to the Midwest, moving on by whatever way was available. I walked, for the most part. Sometimes I hitchhiked, and sometimes I could bribe my way into a bus fare or once, even a train ride. I slept where my body dropped: beside a highway, under a tree, at the edge of a truck stop parking lot, in a cave, and the occasional abandoned shack. I did my best to mind my own business, and not take advantage of anyone who hadn’t offered help in the first place. But you can only be woken up by fire ant bites or fight a coyote for a discarded sandwich so many times. 

So, slowly, I taught myself how to pick locks. I learned how to squeeze all six feet of me through tight spaces and breathe without making a sound. As a rule. I never touched houses. I’d nestle myself deep into a hay bale in some farmer’s barn, or take up two-days’ residence in the end room of a motel. I never meant for this to happen— for people to get hurt. You gotta believe me when I say that. 

Georgia could get pretty nasty in the winter, but the cold of Nebraska was brutal and unexpected. I should’ve been better prepared; I should’ve known what kind of storm I was walking into. But, after two long years on the road, that was the first winter I ever saw snow. It wasn’t so bad that first time— watching it fall in flakes from the booth of a McDonald’s in Omaha. I stared in in awe, steam from the coffee I’d spent my last five bucks on warming my face. The sight of it brought back something I thought I’d lost.

The wonder didn’t stick around long, though. As I headed further toward the panhandle, the weather turned hostile. My jacket and hat were all but frozen onto me, and I’d tied my only spare shirt around my mouth and nose. I had no gloves, or anything to wrap my hands with, and it was becoming a huge problem.

The wind was the worst, whipping over my exposed skin like shards of glass, and out here, there was no shelter from it. In fact, there wasn’t much shelter anywhere. Along the empty fields and highways, I was lucky to find anything to shield me from the wind and snow for a minute, let alone somewhere to stay the night. More and more, I was sleeping on the icy ground and waking up to my teeth chattering.

I don’t remember where exactly I was when my hands stopped working. I think I’d been trying to pick the lock of a power station shed, but I couldn’t flex my fingers. They were red and raw, turning white at the edges. As I looked them over, a black cloud rolled over me, and my soul sank to my feet. I was doomed.

Things get blurry after that. To add insult to injury, a blizzard moved in, leaving me lost in a whiteout. My body began to shut down, and the cold left me too confused to realize it. I just knew something was horribly wrong.

I called out to anyone who would listen, to my mom, to my dad, to my siblings. All that answered back was the howl of the storm. Desperately, I staggered on through the piling snow, and I began to hear a pair of footsteps behind me. They weren’t… right. Disjointed, but fast. Bipedal. I’d seen a fox walk on two legs before, its eyes crossed with madness. This was a little like that, but more intelligent. Purposeful. It was getting faster, and I was getting slower. 

Adrenaline warmed my frozen limbs and I started to run. Branches thrashed into my clothes and skin, shedding their icicles as I fled for my life. I worried I’d somehow wandered into a forest— nowhere I would find help. A shadow fell over me, the deep glow of red eyes, and a scream finally tore out of my chest, lost on the wind. I threw off my jacket and put all the strength I had left into keeping my momentum. 

Then, like the North Star, a light broke the darkness. Shining out into the swirling snow was a flickering porch lamp, half hidden by the side of the large house it belonged to. I had no time to consider my options. I just ran toward it. 

I slammed my useless hands against the front door… once… twice… no answer. In a last ditch effort, I fumbled with the handle, only to discover it was unlocked. The footsteps had devolved into a slow, almost confused rhythm, and I knew this was my only chance. 

I threw open the door and it rattled as I shut it. I cringed and waited for some angry homeowner with a gun to come rushing down the stairs, or a little girl to scream that there was a strange man in her house. Even in my terror, I knew I’d crossed a line. But nothing disturbed the quiet.

I turned and looked out the frosty window set into the now-locked door. No footprints, or sign of any monsters, just ice and snow tossing and turning in the relentless wind. The longer I stood in the warmth, the more the memory fell apart. Had I ever fully seen what was chasing me? Or was it just a trick Old Man Winter was playing?

When I faced into the house again, I was met with another beast entirely. Standing on the patterned rug in the living room and facing me down like the leader of a wolfpack was a tiny dog. She was one or other of those fluffy kinds rich people have, and the growl coming off her told me I was two seconds from having my throat ripped out by her crooked teeth. 

“Come on now, pup,” I tried, “I don’t mean any harm. I just want to warm up, and then I’ll go.”

The furry little thing actually squinted at me. I crouched down and offered out my hand. She stared at it for a good minute before toddling over and giving it a sniff. Her tail started to wag, and I guess I passed whatever test this was. This close, I noticed her collar.

“Tuesday. What a silly name for a dog.”

Recognizing her name, she did a dumb little twirl and fell back on her behind. I decided I liked Tuesday. 

Instinctively, I left my wet and worn boots by the door as I walked into the living room. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d been in an actual house. Apparently, I’d also forgotten today was Christmas. During the time I could keep my phone charged, the days meant less and less to me as they went by with no changes. In the back of my mind somewhere, I knew it was December 25th. But that had become only another day of struggle.

The glow of a dying fire and a blinking Christmas tree cast shadows on the floral wallpaper. Tuesday stood sentinel by it, just in case she had been wrong about me and I tried to rob her owner. I sat down by the fire and, after some internal debate, added a log. The flames flared, glittering off the wrapped boxes laid under the tree. The small amount told me there probably weren’t any kids in the house. Not only that, but most of them were addressed to one person: May. 

I huddled by the fire and said a silent apology to her as the cold in my body melted away. Pain replaced it; my fingers began to crack and bleed, along with my chapped lips. When I finally stopped shivering, I sifted through my bag and found my first aid stash gone. Instead of leaving blood all over this stranger’s house, I hurried into the kitchen to rinse my hands. My weight shifted the hardwood boards beneath me, and as I drank from the faucet, I wondered why my being here hadn’t drawn any more attention than the dog’s. 

The cozy, grandmotherly loneliness of the house gave me the horrible idea that I would go upstairs and find the fresh body of some sweet old lady. In search of answers and something to wrap my stinging hands in, I climbed the stairs, Tuesday following behind. 

The upper floor was small, and filled with photographs. Generations were played out on the walls, and it reminded me just how little I belonged in this picture. There were two doors in the loft, and one was left ajar. Holding my breath, I glanced in through the crack, and almost let it out in relief. I hadn’t stumbled upon a body, but a middle-aged blonde woman sleeping soundly in her bed. Tuesday squirmed between my legs and into the bedroom, laying down at the foot of it. The blankets were pulled to her chin, and she’d fallen asleep with a pair of round-rimmed glasses sitting crooked on her nose. I assumed this was May, and I moved on. Must be a heavy sleeper, I thought to myself. 

I tried the other door, which thankfully turned out to be a bathroom. After a search of the medicine cabinet, I cleaned up my hands and lips, and looked at myself in the mirror. I couldn’t stand it for very long; I didn’t recognize the thin, weathered face that stared back at me. 

Now that my shuffling footsteps had stopped, the faint noises of the house took their place. A heater hummed somewhere in the walls. Water ran idly through the pipes above and below me. The bones of the house settled against the storm outside. Drifting in from the bedroom, where a clock radio sat on May’s nightstand, was the chorus of California Dreamin’. My chest ached at the thought of being somewhere safe and warm.

I slipped out of the bathroom, and went back down the stairs. The living room was just the same as I’d left it.

I should’ve taken a coat, maybe a little bit of food, and gone. But the fear of whatever had driven me here wouldn’t fully leave, overshadowed by the despair of returning to the cold I’d crawled out of. Worse than both, was the years of exhaustion hitting me all at once. Every step was beginning to feel like pushing a boulder. 

Instead, I lingered by the last of the fire, telling myself “just a little bit longer…” My eyelids grew heavy, my mind wandered, and just as I was about to sit down on the green, plush couch, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. As I looked around, wide awake now, I realized that weak morning sunlight was spilling through the windows. In a split second decision that I will regret for the rest of my life, instead of running out the door, I snatched my boots and dove into the closet at the back of the room. 

“Merry Christmas, Tuesday!”

My unwitting roommate emerged into the living room, carrying her dog and sitting down by the Christmas tree. I knew she would probably spend most of that day here. I was trapped. 

The closet was dark and full of thick blankets and quilts. As I buried myself beneath them, I knew deep down that I didn’t stand a chance at keeping myself awake long enough to find an opportunity to leave. I’d barely strung together another mental apology before falling into a deep, dreamless sleep. 

I woke up with a start, like someone had shaken me awake— a phantom of all the nights spent on benches. The smell of Christmas dinner filled my nose, and I prayed that my stomach stayed quiet. I tried to focus on the muffled voices beyond, and it wasn’t a moment too soon.

“I’m going to make up the couch for you guys while dinner finishes, I think I’ve got some spare blankets and sheets in the coat closet.”

I tried to tell myself that she could’ve been talking about any closet. But when I looked up and saw the woolen coats just barely brushing the top of my head, I began to panic. Red and blue lights and handcuffs flashed through my mind, and suddenly I was moving. 

I wedged myself between the wall and the miscellaneous boxes stuffed into the corner. At first, I hoped to just narrowly avoid being seen, like a demon antagonist, folded unnaturally into the corner. But as I froze, the smell of cooking food overwhelmed me again. I could almost see the spread of cooked meats and vegetables, of bread and butter and Christmas cookies, like I was looking through a lit match. It reminded me of home, of the good times. 

As footsteps approached and the door swung open, my hunger betrayed me, and I squeezed my eyes shut as the sound of my stomach growling echoed out into the living room.

“What was that?” May said, with confusion and mild alarm. I held my breath and pressed myself against the ceiling, and that’s when I felt something uneven in the plaster above me. May began to sift through the blankets below. She must’ve not heard exactly where the sound came from, and it gave me just enough time to notice the panel in the top of the closet.

I slid it open, all my stealth put to the ultimate test. I wanted to scramble through, to throw myself into whatever hidden crevice would get me out of this mess, but instead, I forced myself to move slower than I ever had. Once there was a wide enough gap, I raised myself, boots and all, into the crawlspace above. She didn’t even look up.

“I must be losing it,” I heard her say finally, and she gathered up a few blankets and shut the closet door. I’d escaped, and even though I’d narrowly avoided being caught, I still didn’t feel much better. 

Letting out the breath I’d been desperately holding, I pulled out my dying phone and lit the flashlight. I had to slouch against the slope of the ceiling, and I stifled a cough from the dust. The pseudo-room had some electrical panels, and the HVAC; not really a place anyone had any reason to check that often. It was cold, but sheltered from the wind and snow outside still, and I’d made it up with a quilt still wrapped around my shoulders. Three walls met, not much bigger than a coffin, but there was a gap at the fourth, just short enough to barely reach and wide enough to squeeze through if I tried hard enough.

Digging my nails into old wood, I slid through the crack and spilled out into a much larger room. Piles of boxes and forgotten furniture, along with another hatch in the floor, told me this was an attic. Out of the way, far enough removed from the house, and with plenty of places to hide if the need arose; I already knew I was going to be here for a while.

I didn’t want to leave those first few days. I lived off half a water bottle shoved into my pocket and long-expired sewing tin cookies. Almost a week had gone by before I’d run out of alternatives. I had to leave and go back into the house. Unconsciously, I noticed the pattern of when the car outside would leave, and when it would come back. I knew when May would go, and about how much time I had. I just had to work up the nerve.

That first time I dropped down from the closet was terrifying. I half-expected the door to crash open, and for someone to point and scream “AHA!” But the house was silent, save for the sound I soon discovered to be Tuesday gnawing a bone twice her size. I slipped by her and went straight for the kitchen, raiding a small amount of food and water before hightailing it back to the attic. 

That became my routine for a few weeks. As I got used to the new environment, and a slightly more stable place to stay, I started exploring the thin spaces between the inner walls. It was an old house; that much was clear. I could move through most of the inside without leaving it. It was lonely, though, with nothing but dust, fiberglass, and the odd mouse corpse or two. 

Eventually, it all got to me— the dust and dirt, the darkness, and constantly having a wall at my front and at my back, save for the time I risked sleeping in the attic.

I left the closet much earlier one morning, just after May had gone to work. I just meant to walk around a little longer than usual and stretch my legs, but when I made it upstairs, I found myself glancing into the ajar bathroom. It smelled so nice, and steam still clung to the edges of the mirror. I was moving before I had any time to consider it. 

I’d closed my eyes for a moment, after watching the shower water turn dark beneath me for a while, and that’s when I heard it. The skin-crawling sound of nails against glass. There was a small window set into the wall just above the shower, and when I opened my eyes, faint lines ran along the length of the glass, so shallow they almost didn’t look real. 

And maybe they weren’t. But the fear creeping up my spine, turning the scalding water to ice and my legs to stone, was. Something was watching me, and the animal sense deep down in me, the one I’d had to nurture to survive this far, knew it. 

I should’ve run right then, but I couldn’t. I didn’t. Instead, as the feeling slowly passed, and I could breathe again, I finished cleaning up and retreated from the bathroom on eggshells.

In the heart of the house, I felt a little safer. When I passed the laundry room, I took the opportunity to wash my clothes. Tuesday planted herself in the doorway and waited with me, studying me with innocent curiosity. The fluffy face of my companion sapped the unease right out of me, making everything feel just a little bit better. Dogs usually do.

Once the washer and dryer had both cycled, and I’d taken a small amount of food from the kitchen, I stood in the living room for a little while, trying to will myself to make the climb back into cramped darkness. 

Tuesday stood beside me, looking up like an expectant child. I reached down and gave her a scratch behind the ears. 

**BANG**. 

The sound startled me into standing. As I was trying to figure out what it was and where it came from, it repeated. Hard, against the front door. There was a figure there, hard to make out through frosted glass. Tuesday began to growl.

It came again, a fist against the door, and I took a step back. That was all the go-ahead it needed; a flurry of forceful pounding made the door rattle in its frame. I dove for the closet and desperately pulled myself back up to safety, hoping I hadn’t left that poor little dog to die. I waited anxiously until May's car returned in the early evening. I heard her comforting her spooked dog through the vents, and breathed a sigh of relief. 

Those vents became a lifeline for me after that. The snippets of conversation and general sounds of life were my only source of information and my sole entertainment. She mostly talked to Tuesday, though she’d get the occasional phone call or visitor. I learned a lot about her in the weeks and months to come. 

“I think I’m going to bake heart-shaped brownies for the class this year. What do you think, Tues?” She was a school teacher. Elementary, to be specific.

“And when I bring Bigfoot to your doorstep someday, I’ll be the one laughing at you!” She believed in most things: aliens, monsters, demons, ghosts. She held a special place in her heart for Bigfoot. Also for her sister. 

“You really should come visit over spring. The house gets really quiet without you here.” She lived here alone, for the most part. This house went back to her great grandfolk, and even though it was states away from the rest of her family, she made a point to move in when she inherited it. 

After long enough for the anxiety to wear off, I pulled my ear away from the walls and away from the vents and began to venture back out of the crawlspace. I learned the layout of the house inside as well as I knew the spaces between. I could stay out for days at a time, wedging myself into cracks, slipping into closets, and standing silent in the shadows.

I know what words come to mind. Monster. Creeper. Parasite. Trust me, I thought them about myself plenty. But even as the weather warmed, the idea of going back to sleeping under bushes was unbearable. 

So, I did all I could to be a manageable uninvited houseguest. I took and used the bare minimum of what I needed to survive. I did my best to respect her privacy. I even did her dishes a couple times. 

But as time went on, she began to notice. I almost wish she had been openly suspicious, instead of the alternative.

“I think she’s with me,” I heard her say to her visiting sister, “I feel a presence here, especially at night. Footsteps wake me up at odd hours. Sometimes I think I hear whispers. Even Tuesday has noticed it, but she doesn’t seem scared.”

“And you really think it’s Mom?”

She paused. My stomach clenched.

“I do. I think she’s proud of me for being here. For sticking it out, even when it’s been rough. God, I’d give anything to see her again.”

With that, I retreated into the attic, wishing I could crawl out of my own skin. Wishing even more that somehow, impossibly, I could be the spirit she was looking for. A loving mother, sitting at the table with a cup of tea for the lonely woman who couldn’t sleep. Instead, I was just a stowaway. 

Motivated by guilt rather than fear this time, I stayed in the attic for weeks, burning through the small stockpile of supplies I had. Warm weather turned hotter, and the air grew stuffy and doubly harder to breathe in. Summer snuck up on the both of us.

I distinctly remember it was the Fourth of July when things took a turn for the worse. I could hear the nonstop fireworks all around, and that was the night I decided I would leave. With her few months off, May didn’t leave the house much, but she had a doctor’s appointment the next day. I’d be gone by the afternoon, and she’d never have to know the truth. 

I’d almost fallen asleep, tossing and turning in the persistent heat. Then, all of a sudden, a rush of cool air soothed my sweaty skin. I almost surrendered to it and let the new comfort pull me into sleep. I don’t think I’d be writing this if I had. But, despite the exhaustion, I fought it away. Something wasn’t right. That’s when the sniffing started. That’s when I heard the gnawing.

Moonlight spilled in as shingles crumbled and wood was pulled away. Confused at first, I walked toward the source of the noise, and narrowly avoided losing my leg to whatever was clawing into the hole. Stumbling back, I watched the small view outside fill with dark fur, and a single, glowing eye. The sniffing turned to scratching. The gnawing grew savage. In the time it took me to reach the middle of the room, the hole opened wide enough for the thing to poke its head through. Teeth the size of railroad ties clicked together in my direction as those red eyes rolled around in their sockets. Its ears laid flat back against the side of its long face, and a low growl replaced the squeak I’d grown accustomed to hearing every once in a while living here. 

I watched, paralyzed, as the rat’s head gave way to the shoulders and arms of a man as it wriggled its way into the attic. Massive as it was, it moved almost silently. Sharp nails curled on the ends of dirty human feet, half of a chewed-on tail hanging behind them. It closed the distance between us as I backed against the far wall.

Gaunt and doubled over on itself, it came eye-to-eye with me. When our gazes met, I could hear it. The growls suddenly had horrible meaning; they made words. This… creature. It lusted for blood, for fear, for pain. It hated. It wouldn’t stop until the entire world was razed, piece by insignificant piece. And somehow, by some insane coincidence, this house was the lucky starting point. 

“Go away,” I said shakily, into the face of death, “leave this house!”

I shut my eyes, unable to stand it, and swung first, for all the good it would do. Instead, I hit empty air. I risked opening my eyes, and found nothing. All it left in its wake was a rotten smell, and the ratty remains of the jacket I’d lost on the way here. The dots started to connect. 

I stood there for a while, trying desperately to make sense of everything that just happened. When the light of day started to creep in through the hole, my legs finally unlocked. I took a few loose boards from the crawlspace and waited until May left to nail them over the hole, shoving furniture against it for good measure. 

It never left. During the nights, it paced the outside, just loud enough for me to hear. The stench was overwhelming, seeping through the cracks in the attic roof. It tapped the walls as it went, and I followed it. I couldn’t understand why it hadn’t come to kill us yet, but I would play its game, if it had any hope of being a warning.  

Tap. “You won’t get away with this.” Tap tap. “I won’t let you, you rotten fuck.” Tap tap tap.

I was losing it a little, more than I already had. I followed the yellow wallpaper, crawling along the attic floor whenever the tapping began and insulting the horrible thing I could almost see on the other side. 

All this to say, I wasn’t paying attention when I nudged a box or two, but the shattering of a glass Jack o’Lantern snapped me out of it. I’d made a thousand tiny sounds up here, but this one was too loud to be ignored. Confused, unsure footsteps made their way through the house and to the attic hatch. 

“Hello?” She called, and I bit my lip, choking back the urge to just give myself away. But I couldn’t. If I got forced out now, she would be defenseless, having no idea what lurked just beyond her walls until it was too late. Instead, I moved quietly around the small space, dodging her until she found the decoration and decided out loud it had just been an animal. Or maybe her motherly spirit playing a nasty joke.

I didn’t like it, but it gave me an idea. She wasn’t safe here, and there was no chance or time for me to warn her properly. I could still get her to leave before it was too late, but it wouldn’t be pretty. 

I bided my time as the nights grew colder and longer. When I started, it was small things. Knocking on interior walls. Opening cabinets and drawers, leaving things in too much of a mess to be ignored. It was subtle at first, but May began to get nervous. I left her notes in odd places, an inarguable “GET OUT” she would always find. Every night, before the snow grew too heavy, I saw the shining red of the rat’s eye. The huff of its hungry breath. The scratching and tapping that never seemed to stop once the sun went down. 

I thanked god that May wasn’t a night owl. And then I made things worse. The ‘spirit’ in her house got serious.

I ran laps around the attic, up and down the stairs, racing through the house and ducking silently into a closet or a shadow whenever she gave chase to the split-second silhouette her sleepy eyes had seen. I stood on the hatch ladder and screamed with real despair, dashing out of sight when she rushed to investigate. I left long scratches on her doors and smeared handprints on her windows, something evil trying desperately to get out. 

She called the police the first time when the fire in the fireplace started on its own. They cared at first, sure. But when several full sweeps of the house found nothing, they began to distance themselves from the whole thing. They branded her as crazy, and it was quickly looking that way. By the week of Thanksgiving, one she’d have to spend alone in her prison of a house, she didn’t sleep in her bedroom anymore. Her eyes were sunken and her hair was a mess. But she was still clinging on.

Silently, I begged her to give up. To just pick up Tuesday, throw a bag in her car, and never come back to this place. If I was the only thing left to eat, I could be okay with that. I deserved it. Her grip on sanity was slipping, and the guilt I felt was so heavy I could barely process it. 

I watched her eat Thanksgiving dinner alone, letting the house go unhaunted for the day. It was almost peaceful. She had to think it was over. I only left long enough to grab a picture frame from her bedroom, somewhere I hadn’t dared to step foot in before. 

As midnight broke, I lowered myself down from the crawlspace I’d slipped into almost a year before. As I walked around the couch, I came eye to eye with Tuesday. She didn’t growl at me, only wagged her tail— how would her little doggy brain know it was my fault? 

Carefully, I took a handful of ash from the fireplace and spread my repeated message across the carpet. I looked at May one more time, curled in on herself next to her dog, a blanket pulled tight around her. She looked thin, and small. Her hair was tangled, with a few new gray strands. She’d fallen asleep with her glasses on again.

I wiped my eyes and sat the broken picture below the same words from before. As I climbed back into the ceiling, I thumped my boot hard against the wall. I heard her stir. This time, I wasn’t the one to scream. 

Through all my self-hatred, it finally worked. 

“I can’t do it anymore,” I heard her sob to her sister, the other end of a late night phone call. “I’ll leave now and be there in the morning. I know— I know I should’ve come sooner. But I’m coming now.” A sick sense of relief filled me as I listened to her shoving things into a bag and cursing whatever had driven her out of her family house. 

Exhaustion, both emotional and physical, was catching up with me. As I slouched beside the attic vent I was eavesdropping from, I was already almost gone. Maybe I’d get a full night’s rest, or maybe I’d be eaten in my sleep. Either way, it was finally quiet.

My head snapped up. I had just enough time to jump to my feet before the tap-less silence was broken by the cracking of wood. The abomination burst through the hole I’d covered like a battering ram, and it wasn’t here to introduce itself this time. An enormous claw came down, missing my face by inches. 

I dodged as best I could, but as I rounded the corner of one of the piles of boxed junk, I lost my footing and came down hard on the floor. As powerful as the creature seemed, no one is immune to inertia. It barreled past where I’d fallen, its course corrected just enough to send it to the floor, but not on top of me. I yelped as it crashed halfway through the attic hatch, stuck and screeching. Tuesday began to bark wildly.

It was a headstart, and however short it was, I was taking it. I launched myself through the gaps in the walls and burst out of the crawlspace, the cover board shattering beneath me as I fell. 

I threw myself out of the closet, and for the first time, May and I met terrified eyes. Time seemed to stand still. In the back of my mind, I still lived in that first night. That song was still playing. Always playing. If I didn’t tell her, I could leave today…

“RUN! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, RUN!”

With the evidence clearly heard upstairs, she didn’t have time to disbelieve the source. She broke free of whatever fear had locked her in place, scooped up Tuesday, and turned to do just that. I closed my eyes, waiting for the end. She’d made it out. That’s all I cared about.

I wish I could tell you that’s what happened. But the sounds of flesh tearing and blood spraying wasn’t from my own chest. I opened my eyes, and regretted it immediately. The front door hung open, her hand still dangling loose just above the handle. Flakes of snow blew in, dyed red by the fountain of blood bubbling from beneath the claws in her chest. She coughed once, twice, then the creature sank its jaws into her head. I stood by, frozen. 

A sharp yip brought me out of my stupor, and as a fluffy ball of red and white came sprinting toward me, I bent down and caught her like some twisted umpire. The creature looked back at me, its face dripping with gore, and it laughed. I held Tuesday close as I scrambled back into the walls. 

It never came after me. I had to listen to it chewing for hours through the walls, losing what little was in my stomach to begin with. Eventually, the millions of little noises blended together, forming a giant whiteout that surrounded my brain. 

I spent three days like that, I think. Could’ve been longer. Maybe not. The world felt distant. All I did was cry, and try my best to clean the blood from Tuesday’s fur. I kept her alive. It was the absolute least I could do. 

“You’re a good dog,” I told her, whenever I could force out words, “such a good little dog.” Her chest heaved when I held her close, grief we shared. The kind that all living, loving things will know at least once. 

When the fog lifted, I began searching for a way out. The attic was freezing now, the roof cave-in filled with snow. I dug until my fingers went numb, but it wasn’t gonna happen. At some point, I hit ice, thick and blue. It didn’t make sense, but I was fucking done looking for sense. 

I crawled through the walls for hours, looking for a weak spot. Nothing. The destroyed attic hatch was a gamble. I wasn’t stupid enough to not call a mousetrap a mousetrap. As soon as I dropped down, a looming shadow and the smell of old blood sent me scrambling back up the unsteady ladder. 

The cops came once. A week had gone by before anyone took note of May’s absence. They swept around for an hour or two, and they left. I never saw them again. 

Her sister stayed longer, the one time she dared to step foot in her sister’s haunted house. She took some of the photographs, walking around with wide eyes and a nervous pace, like a wolf was breathing down her neck. I beat my fists against the walls and screamed when she left. 

I know I could leave, if I tried hard enough. There are those minute-long spaces where it’s crawling in and out the same way I did, taunting me, or when it’s devouring the corpse of another person it’s pulled into here in the dead of night like a predator. There are moments when Tuesday and I could make a break for it. I could use what little battery is left on my phone to try and call someone. Anyone. But I don’t.

The truth is, I’m still scared. I’m sorry. I know it’s selfish. 

I play it out constantly in my mind, the things that could happen. I might end up in the bulging gut along with May, and all the other dinners that no one cared enough about to miss. There’s also a jail cell/padded room waiting for me out there, somewhere. And then, there’s the simple return. I could wander out into the growing winter and freeze. None of it would have mattered in the end, and that scares me much more than hypothermia. 

That being said, I don’t want to die. Lives are still at stake, and not just the one buried in my cocoon of blankets. I don’t deserve to escape this nightmare, but I’ll do it for May. Once the ice begins to thaw, I’ll find her sister. I’ll figure out something. I won’t let this thing have me; I won’t let it win.

When I run for it, I’ll think about that summer day that feels like lifetimes ago. Before everything went wrong. I’ll think of a boy who held my face and called me brave, and I’ll try to prove it. I’ll flee this place like a rat off a sinking ship, and I’ll come back with retribution. I just have to make it through the cold…

Okay, so I wasn’t exactly *looking* for another productivity gimmick, but something called **“The Brain Song”** kept popping up on my feed. Supposedly, it’s a new memory‑boosting audio program that claims to *re‑tune* the way you focus and recall information.  

I’ll admit, at first it sounded like classic internet fluff, but curiosity (and too many coffee‑fueled all‑nighters) got the best of me. So, I decided to give it a real shot. After a week of using it for study and work—I’m honestly kind of blown away. My recall during meetings improved, and those mid‑day brain fogs seemed to fade a bit. It’s weird but in a really good way.

We’ve all known each other for years so we know the ins and outs of each other’s habits. 

I recently started a new job and I am very eager to show them that I’m good at what I do. Unfortunately it seems like my boss (unconsciously) ignores me and speaks more often to my other coworker. This coworker though is someone I’m careful of. While cordial- I’ve already had experiences with him where I know he’d throw me under the bus if he was given a penny. 

But at times she also ignores us both together. She seems to be a great person to speak to when she’s not your manager. I see other teams in my department with great chemistry so the lack of harmony does stress me out. Could be moreso I just feel weird for being ignored (ie: she will ask my other coworker if he wants coffee. She will ask him about his commute. If they’re having a business convo that’s relevant to me later- they don’t rope me in. I physically have to stand up and insert myself). 

If I did anything to offend her I wish I knew and could stop. I have a feeling that it seem as though my gung-ho behavior from the first week pissed her off and now I can’t rewrite it. I guess it makes me sad because I have a good relationship already with literally everyone else in the department. So having my direct manager ignore me hurts. Any advice :(?

1qsitr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1qsitr3/microplastics_significantly_decrease_lifespan/,Microplastics significantly decrease lifespan. Here are the best ways to minimise microplastics and scientific evidence.,"Microplastics are no longer just an environmental problem, they are a biological one. For many years people thought plastic was something around us, outside the body. Today we know this is no longer true. Tiny plastic particles are found inside human blood, lungs, liver, placenta, reproductive organs, breast milk, and even brain tissue. This changes everything. When something enters almost every organ of the body, it becomes a lifespan issue. Microplastics are now part of our internal environment, and biology reacts to them every single day.

One of the most dangerous things about microplastics is that the body cannot easily break them down. Unlike many toxins that can be processed and removed, plastic particles stay. They accumulate slowly over years and decades. Exposure begins before birth and continues daily through water, food, air, and objects we touch. This is not a one-time hit. It is a lifelong stacking of damage. Small amounts may seem harmless, but aging is driven by accumulation, not single events.

Aging at its core is fueled by chronic inflammation, and microplastics are very good at causing it. When plastic particles enter tissues, immune cells react as if something is wrong, because something is. This keeps the immune system in a low but constant state of irritation. Oxidative stress rises, mitochondria work worse, blood vessels become inflamed. Anything that keeps the immune system switched on for years accelerates aging and disease. Plastic does exactly that, quietly and continuously.

Plastics also interfere with hormones, which control almost every process related to aging. Many plastic additives behave like fake hormones that confuse the body. They can disturb estrogen, testosterone, thyroid hormones, and stress hormones. This affects fertility, metabolism, fat storage, brain function, and energy levels. Hormonal balance is one of the foundations of healthy aging, and microplastics slowly push it off track without obvious warning signs.

One of the most alarming findings is the link between microplastics and cardiovascular disease. Plastic particles have been found inside arterial plaques. Their presence is associated with higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. Blood vessels are sensitive structures, and inflammation inside them is deadly over time. Plastic inside arteries is not harmless debris, it actively contributes to the diseases that kill most people as they age.

Cancer risk is another serious concern. Microplastics increase oxidative stress and can damage DNA directly. They also act like carriers, bringing heavy metals and other toxic chemicals into cells. This combination creates the perfect environment for mutations to accumulate. Cancer is not caused by one thing, but by repeated damage over time, and plastic adds another constant source of injury.

The truth is that nobody can completely avoid microplastics. They are everywhere. But dose still matters. Aging is not about perfection, it is about reducing unnecessary damage. You may not eliminate plastic exposure, but you can stop flooding your body with the biggest sources. Reducing exposure lowers cumulative harm, and cumulative harm is what shortens lifespan.

One of the most powerful steps is stopping the use of plastic bottles for drinking. Bottled water often contains far more microplastics than tap water. Switching to glass or stainless steel bottles is simple and makes a real difference. The same applies to food. Plastic containers, plastic wrap, and heating food in plastic massively increase plastic ingestion. Plastic plus heat is one of the worst combinations for the human body.

Food quality also matters. Ultra-processed foods come wrapped, stored, and handled in plastic many times before reaching your plate. This adds plastic exposure on top of metabolic damage. Hot drinks are another hidden source, especially plastic tea bags and coffee machines with plastic parts. Even clothing plays a role, as synthetic fabrics release plastic fibers into the air we breathe, especially indoors.

Microplastics are a new aging accelerator added to modern life. They drive inflammation, disrupt hormones, damage blood vessels, and stress DNA. You cannot avoid them completely, but you can reduce your exposure enough to matter. Longevity is built by removing silent harms, not just adding supplements. Protecting your body from plastic is not paranoia, it is prevention.

I am a 25 year old bisexual (more female preference) male. I'm bi-racial, around 5'10 (177.8 cm) and practically blind without my glasses. I have brown eyes and short brown hair that can get curly if it grows out. I'm on the skinnier and lean side, weighing only 135 pounds as I have a rather high metabolism. I do struggle with mental issues, but I am on medications and quite stable with them.

I have two pets. A cat that doesn't like people and prefers to hide from them when they come over and a Leopard Gecko that I've had since I was about 8 years old. 

I'm a huge nerd! I love DnD (would love to actually do a game of it one day), Magic the Gathering, History, Anime, Manga, Fantasy, Science Fiction, etc. I'm always open to trying new things as well. 

I play a bunch of video games in my spare time. Mostly RPG's and fighting games. Baldur's Gate 3 and Skyrim have me in a chokehold right now! Same with Warframe! Although, Code Vein 2 has been keeping my attention as well since it recently came out. I do play on Xbox as my PC gave out on me a couple of years ago unfortunately. Haven't had the funds to get a new one yet. 

I work 12 hour shifts Friday through Sunday and have Monday through Thursday off so I have a lot of time to do stuff. Let's meet up and get coffee or Boba! 😋

As for what I'm looking for, honestly I'm just looking for someone to match my energy really. Personality is the most important thing to me above all else. 

That and kindness. Someone who is sweet, patient, nerdy and an absolute goofball would have my heart instantly if I'm honest lol. 

I would prefer someone around my age but I don't mind a little younger or a little older. 

If this catches anyone's attention please feel free to reach out! I do have a Discord but I will not post that here. If we click and hit it off I'll be more than happy to give that to you.

I love learning. I feel that you should always strive to learn. I love learning about different: cultures, perspectives,  hobbies, recipes, and anything in between. I will be very interested and enthusiastic about whatever it is you are passionate about. I enjoy learning people's little quirks and sharing my own.

I don't travel far a lot, but I enjoy going on mini adventures and discovering new places. I often take my kids hiking and camping.

I have been volunteering for a Christmas/Holiday Card Project for the last decade where we send out Christmas/Holiday cards to people who have been nominated,  typically older people who do not have family nearby or those who just need extra cheer during the season due to circumstances. I will go to estate sales and buy the entire lot of cards and envelopes to share with others. 
I grew up writing letters to family and friends (thanks no cell-phone childhood), so having a pen pal or two would revive my love of hand written letters and cards. 

Things about me:
LIKES/LOVES:
* Reading (English Major here, so although I have read a lot of the heavier, deep-diving materials, I prefer lighter reads now.)
* Learning new things- even if they are entirely random or seemingly pointless 
* Cooking for large gatherings of family and friends
* Coastal areas and Mountain areas (lived in both)
* Nearly anything historical
* Taking random drives to find new places to either take photos or observe nature
* Skyrim is my all-time favorite video game. (I have a dragon shout tattoo on my leg. Haha)
* I spend time with my family- playing D&D, watching football, playing board games, camping and, hiking
* Gardening and growing my own veggies- but not in a super crunchy almond mom kind of way. Lol
* The Office, Parks and Rec, Resident Alien, Superstore, Good Mythical Morning, Ghost Files, etc is my go-to's for background noise or binge weekends
*K-Pop-Stray Kids and Ateez are my favs

DISLIKES:
* Coffee ( I know, I know...)

I like to add little things in my cards/snail mail because it just brings me joy. It could be stickers, a tea bag if whatever I happen to be sipping on at the moment, or anything else that I may find and want to share! You do not have to reciprocate that part at all. 

Well, this is feeling like a personals ad, so I let ya go! DM if you'd like to be penpals!

1qsiiry,https://i.redd.it/dndoan7ywrgg1.jpeg,"Breaking down the episode “The Parallel” - 8 categories, 1 final score","S4, Ep 11: “The Parallel”

(An astronaut seems to land in a parallel dimension)

\-

\-

\-

1️⃣ Storyline:

I have very mixed feelings and thoughts on this episode. I’ll start with the negative: so many of the scenes are just straight up boring, and feel constipated. And while the longer runtime can feel like a chore with this episode because some of the sections of the story drag on, the basic plot idea actually should have been perfect for a long-form narrative. It’s just not a very compelling script. 

As for the good, there are moments in “The Parallel” that begin to accomplish what “Person or Persons Unknown” failed to do (in my eyes at least). Unlike the characters in that TZ, the players here feel like real people, and the protagonist truly is reckoning with an existential and time-space crisis. In “The Parallel”, Robert Gaines and his family and colleagues are allowed to breathe and respond authentically, whereas the interactions in “Person or Persons Unknown” just feel like a skit to me. 

In total, this Twilight Zone does still fall under the category of “great idea, flawed and undercooked execution”. 

Score: 4/10 

—————————

2️⃣ Atmosphere:

I almost wrote something to the effect of “I can’t expect an episode to be too atmospheric when it’s almost entirely composed of scenes set in a suburban home and a hospital room”, and then I’m reminded that “And When the Sky Was Opened” is set primarily in a hospital room and a bar. 

There are a couple moments that start to really pull me in atmospherically (I love the shot where the other military men are slowly rotating just a bit, making us feel disoriented and a little crazy) but in general this isn’t a category that serves the episode too much. 

Score: 3/10

—————————

3️⃣ Existential Terror: 

This episode doesn’t lean as far into the yawning chasm of existential terror as “And When the Sky Was Opened”, but I’m willing to say it belongs in that same category of type of TZ story. I think the ending robs us of what could’ve been an all-time existential spiral, and the FINAL moment has an unsatisfying “see, look! It’s still the Twilight Zone, spooooky!” tacked-on feel. Nevertheless, there is some real psychological scariness present for this one. 

Score: 8/10

—————————

4️⃣ Creepiness:

There are a couple moments between Gaines and his family that feel pretty unnerving; unfortunately, the episode doesn’t seem to want to explore them. I think that was a huge missed opportunity. I’m thinking specifically of the scene where Robert and his wife embrace and kiss, and her hands go rigid behind his neck, and you can tell she’s terrified. I don’t know exactly what I would’ve wanted to see there, but what was a very tense and creepy moment just kind of dissipates. 

Score: 3/10

—————————

5️⃣ Message:

I don’t know that there’s a lesson to be learned for us as individuals, but - while I despise the exposition dump in which it’s given - we do get a solid reminder about just how little we actually know about the universe, toward the end of the episode. 

Score: 4/10

—————————

6️⃣ World-Building:

Repeating an all-too-familiar refrain, this 50-minute episode has no excuse for not better constructing the world and life that is Robert Gaines. We are given just enough, but the Twilight Zone has had much meatier episodes in half the time. The characters and settings are largely one-dimensional. 

Score: 3/10

—————————

7️⃣ Acting:

I have no issue with the acting. I also come away unimpressed by it. 

Score: 5/10

—————————

8️⃣ The Human Condition:

I do feel for Robert and his wife and their girl, but I’ve given enough credit for that in the Existential Terror section. Outside of the horror that would exist if my family looked the same but acted differently (or vice versa), I don’t feel emotionally tethered to the characters in a great way through much of “The Parallel”. 

I will say, I love the little scene at the start of the episode, when the mom and daughter both cannot sleep and so they get coffee and cocoa. I also really like the Colonel, Bill Connacher - he portrays a humanity and warmth, amidst the professionalism and sobriety required of his military status. 

Score: 5/10

—————————

✅ Total Score:

35

“The Parallel” shares some DNA with “Little Girl Lost”, in a way. Both have very exciting and forward-thinking premises, and do a pretty great job roping in the viewer almost immediately. And while I love the scenes of the other dimension in “Little Girl Lost”, I’d argue both of these Twilight Zones could have explored their respective extra-ordinary worlds in a much deeper way and I’m left wanting in that regard. 

However, at least with “Little Girl Lost” you can point to the short runtime as a reason why they couldn’t chew on too much narrative meat. With “The Parallel”, there is no excuse. Double the runtime, and yet this episode never comes close to the intensity, creepiness, or panic of that earlier dimension-twisting TZ. It’s far from a bad Twilight Zone, but I’ll be in no hurry to revisit it either.

*Used AI to help correct grammar and organize my thoughts.*

Currently taking pharmacology & nutrition in nursing school. I learned quite a bit about why some medications hit different than others, and I think I found something worth sharing.

**TL;DR:** Alvogen is missing key inactive ingredients that help the tablet dissolve quickly. If your diet is low in healthy fats, your body can't compensate, and the meds don't absorb properly. Eating eggs before dosing fixed it for me.

**THE INACTIVE INGREDIENT PROBLEM**

Not all generics are formulated the same. Compare Teva vs Alvogen:

**Ingredient**	|**Teva**	|**Alvogen**

Microcrystalline cellulose	|✓	|✓

Corn starch	|✓	|✓

Magnesium stearate	|✓	|✓

Silicon dioxide	|✓	|✓

**Sucrose + Maltodextrin**	|✓	|✗

**Saccharin sodium**	|✓	|✗	Both contain **magnesium stearate** — a waxy, hydrophobic (water-repelling) lubricant used in manufacturing. It coats the tablet and drug particles inside, creating a barrier that repels water.

**The difference:** Teva includes sugars (sucrose, maltodextrin) that dissolve instantly and punch water channels through that waxy barrier. Alvogen doesn't have this — just the barrier with no built-in workaround.

So if you're on Alvogen, your body has to do the work of breaking through that waxy coating on its own.

**WHERE BILE COMES IN (THE CHEMISTRY)**

Amphetamine salts are water-soluble — they dissolve fine once water reaches them. The problem is **access**. The magnesium stearate coating repels water.

Your body's natural solution? **Bile salts.**

Bile is a natural surfactant (basically a detergent). It has a water-loving head and a fat-loving tail. It inserts into the hydrophobic barrier, reduces surface tension, and lets water penetrate the tablet so it can dissolve.

Here's the cascade:

1. You eat fat
2. Fat hits your small intestine → triggers **CCK (cholecystokinin)** release
3. CCK tells your gallbladder to **contract**
4. Stored bile floods into your digestive tract
5. Bile wets the tablet surface → water penetrates → tablet disintegrates → drug dissolves

**No fat = no CCK = no bile release = tablet sits there intact way longer than it should.**

Teva's sugars do this job for you. Alvogen makes you rely on your own bile.

**WHY YOUR DIET MIGHT BE SABOTAGING YOUR MEDS**

The standard American diet sets you up for bile dysfunction:

* **Low healthy fat intake** → gallbladder never contracts → bile becomes thick sludge (""use it or lose it"")
* **High refined carbs/sugar** → insulin resistance → fatty liver → impaired bile acid synthesis
* **Seed oils / fake industrial oils** → inflammation → altered bile composition
* **High estrogen / xenoestrogens** → reduced bile salt production, sluggish gallbladder

**Foods that WON'T help (or make it worse):**

* Plain toast, crackers, cereal (no fat = no bile trigger)
* Skim milk, fat-free yogurt
* MCT oil / coconut oil (medium-chain fats bypass bile entirely)
* Black coffee on empty stomach
* Pure sugar, candy, juice

**MY SITUATION**

For 2+ years my diet has been primarily: lean protein, vegetables, jasmine rice, protein powder, fruit, and oatmeal. Basically **zero healthy fats**.

Now I have taken Teva with 0 food or fat and the medication performed just fine for me.

**WHY EGG YOLK IS THE BEST FIX**

Not all fats are equal for triggering bile. Egg yolk is the optimal choice because it hits three mechanisms:

1. **Long-chain fatty acids** — potent CCK triggers (oleic acid, linoleic acid)
2. **Amino acids** — tryptophan and phenylalanine independently stimulate CCK release
3. **Lecithin (phosphatidylcholine)** — a natural surfactant that works alongside bile

Egg yolk is basically a bile-releasing, tablet-dissolving powerhouse.

**MY EXPERIMENT**

For 5 days straight, I ate **2 whole eggs sunny side up** (runny yolk) with a full glass of water first thing in the morning. Waited 15-30 minutes, then took my Alvogen 30mg IR.

**Results:** Within 20 minutes, meds kicked in hard. Solid 5 hours of productivity. I normally need caffeine to boost them, but this time a few sips felt like too much — the meds were actually working on their own.

**Today:** Ran out of eggs. Ate plain chicken and veggies before dosing. **Zero therapeutic effect.** Felt lazy all day.

Tomorrow I'm going back to eggs to confirm.

**DISCLAIMERS**

* **This is NOT medical advice**
* **This is for Alvorgen only and I am aware some meds don't work with fats.**
* Everyone's body is different — this might not apply to you
* I'm aware the generics have changed over the years and many don't work like they used to

**WHAT YOU CAN DO**

1. Compare inactive ingredients between manufacturers that work for you vs. ones that don't
2. Look for: sucrose, maltodextrin (dissolution aids that create water channels)
3. Egg yolks are the best option — or nuts, avocado, butter

Shadows danced across the garden of Saint Chester's and the harrowing sound of tortured souls whisked by in the wind. Souls that were done with the severe heat wave that has been going on for more than two weeks. California was burning alive and the people were beginning to forget the memory of winter. The cold snow felt distant enough to be a joke and surely, ice was an illusion. 

Sweltering heat was their life now.

Cain Farrell was experiencing a similar train of troubled thoughts. Sprawled on a criss-cross patterned picnic blanket beneath the shade of a towering oak tree, he lazily batted his long lashes at the mid-afternoon sun, his patience with the scorching day already wearing thin.

With deliberate effort, he lifted his hand and checked the time. Twenty past three. He let his hand fall onto his face, not bothering to fix his askew glasses. The heat had sapped his energy, leaving him languid. 

For weeks, he had been pampering himself with the dull comforts of a monotonous work life. The most excitement he’d had in the past week was when his co-worker had tried to Bluetooth-connect the coffee machine to his computer to ‘remotely’ make espresso. And no, he did not try to stop him. So it was obvious; he wanted- no, he needed- a change. 

And what better way to find excitement than to make some yourself? 

Any moment now.

Once again, with force of habit, Cain’s eyes strayed to the hands on his watch. He groaned. Where was the thrill he was promised? Why were they late? He seethed, remembering the stack of green bills he had paid for this occasion. Honestly, now that he thought about it, it had sounded too good (and weird) to be true. 

He made up his mind. 

Disappointed, he shifted and reluctantly got to his feet. 

Right then, (Oh, about time) a large white van appeared. It charged into the road leading across the garden before suddenly screeching to a halt. The doors flung open. A group stormed out, wrapped in black from head to toe.

Seconds later, the unmistakable sound of gunshots- followed by high-pitched, blood-curdling screams. The lazy afternoon ambience shattered as the world drowned in chaos. 

Finally. 

Unbothered, Cain sat back down. He was so ready for this. He almost closed his eyes, imagining it. But no- there wasn’t a second chance, he’s got to enjoy this. He kept himself fully alert and aware. 

The excitement hit him like a truck full of kidnappers. Literally.

Ten minutes later, he was huddled, hands and legs bound, in the back of the van. He had also been blindfolded, but during the intentional struggle he had put up, it had ridden down around his neck. A weak light shone through a slit on one of the walls of the van, and if one of the men had looked back, they would have seen the faint smile on his lips and the spark of pure joy in his eyes. Not your typical kidnappee. The ride resumed in an awkward silence, the kidnappers paying no attention to him. Cain felt the excitement wear off to be replaced with ennui. He began to whistle, wondering how long the ride was going to last.

“Hey, you! Keep that trap shut! What are you, a moron?”

Cain frowned. That was awfully rude. 

They were not getting that tip. 

A few minutes later, just when boredom had started to gnaw at his edges once again, the truck came to an abrupt stop. Cain lurched forward, his head bumping the front wall. He bit down a tasteful curse, sensing the audience there would not appreciate it. Then the people jumped into action. He was thrown over someone's shoulder with ease, his legs colliding with their chest. He opened his mouth, either to protest or give out some pointers in handling clients, heaven knows, but the words died a quick and bitter death when he saw his surroundings. This- this was definitely NOT his office. Where he was supposed to be taken.  That’s when the confusion that he had harboured through the ordeal morphed into a deep, dark and horrifying dread. His aching body, now perched painfully on some unknown person’s shoulder like a prized ragdoll, began to tremble uncontrollably. 

“Wait, WAIT, Something’s wrong,” Cain began to struggle, his bound arms clawing at the person’s back while his legs drummed frantically against their very solid chest. “Are you or are you not the people I hired? I- that I paid, to- to” a Sudden jolt, then pain shot up his stomach and into his back as they shook him on their shoulder. “Hired us? To do what? Kidnap you?”  Cain felt himself bobble up and down as he, for it sounded like an ugly man to him, laughed. A hideous sound that did nothing but pour cement on his fears. And his mouth, apparently disconnected from his spiralling brain and having no self-control, let out a meek, “Yes?” 

Cue yet another round of humiliating laughter, this time accompanied by the rest of the kidnapping crew. Cain felt himself freeze. the pain; the humiliation. It was all too much. When they carried him into the sketchy, rotting building he had seen from the corner of his eye before, Cain had fully ceased to struggle. What on earth went wrong? 

 The assistant manager at Helios-Global Company, straightened the name plate at her boss’s table for the fifteenth time that week. His favourite coffee mug had started to collect dust on his blotched and old coaster that she had suggested on multiple occasions to replace. When she withdrew her hands, with a slight tremor in them if anyone cared to notice, her fingers brushed the stationary holder that had been poised dangerously close to the table’s edge. A loud clatter, and she gasped quietly when pens and paper pads scattered across the office floor. She waited a heartbeat, her mind immediately expecting his to barge in, demanding who broke what this time. But not today.  She let out a low sigh and crouched down to pick up the wandering stationery. Her quick hands found the pens and pencils but the paper pad was missing. Frowning, she lowered her head to peek under the table.  There it was. 

Sher reached out, dust tickling her fingers, and pulled out the paper pad and with it another crisp-looking paper. She stilled, her years-of-work-honed eyes immediately catching the headline. “Your wildest ideas: come to life.

Across the city in St. Cheshire’s Sanctuary, amidst the lazy crowd that lounged under the gloaming sun, a group of amateur kidnappers looked around, scratching their heads.

They glanced briefly at a man, who looked vaguely similar if you squinted hard enough, and exercised the notion of just grabbing him and taking off. Their leader reminded them of the money. And the rest of the green bills to come. So they waited some more.

Shadows danced across the garden of Saint Chester's and the harrowing sound of tortured souls whisked by in the wind. Souls that were done with the severe heat wave that has been going on for more than two weeks. California was burning alive and the people were beginning to forget the memory of winter. The cold snow felt distant enough to be a joke and surely, ice was an illusion. 

Sweltering heat was their life now.

Cain Farrell was experiencing a similar train of troubled thoughts. Sprawled on a criss-cross patterned picnic blanket beneath the shade of a towering oak tree, he lazily batted his long lashes at the mid-afternoon sun, his patience with the scorching day already wearing thin.

With deliberate effort, he lifted his hand and checked the time. Twenty past three. He let his hand fall onto his face, not bothering to fix his askew glasses. The heat had sapped his energy, leaving him languid. 

For weeks, he had been pampering himself with the dull comforts of a monotonous work life. The most excitement he’d had in the past week was when his co-worker had tried to Bluetooth-connect the coffee machine to his computer to ‘remotely’ make espresso. And no, he did not try to stop him. So it was obvious; he wanted- no, he needed- a change. 

And what better way to find excitement than to make some yourself? 

Any moment now.

Once again, with force of habit, Cain’s eyes strayed to the hands on his watch. He groaned. Where was the thrill he was promised? Why were they late? He seethed, remembering the stack of green bills he had paid for this occasion. Honestly, now that he thought about it, it had sounded too good (and weird) to be true. 

He made up his mind. 

Disappointed, he shifted and reluctantly got to his feet. 

Right then, (Oh, about time) a large white van appeared. It charged into the road leading across the garden before suddenly screeching to a halt. The doors flung open. A group stormed out, wrapped in black from head to toe.

Seconds later, the unmistakable sound of gunshots- followed by high-pitched, blood-curdling screams. The lazy afternoon ambience shattered as the world drowned in chaos. 

Finally. 

Unbothered, Cain sat back down. He was so ready for this. He almost closed his eyes, imagining it. But no- there wasn’t a second chance, he’s got to enjoy this. He kept himself fully alert and aware. 

The excitement hit him like a truck full of kidnappers. Literally.

Ten minutes later, he was huddled, hands and legs bound, in the back of the van. He had also been blindfolded, but during the intentional struggle he had put up, it had ridden down around his neck. A weak light shone through a slit on one of the walls of the van, and if one of the men had looked back, they would have seen the faint smile on his lips and the spark of pure joy in his eyes. Not your typical kidnappee. The ride resumed in an awkward silence, the kidnappers paying no attention to him. Cain felt the excitement wear off to be replaced with ennui. He began to whistle, wondering how long the ride was going to last.

**[Posted on the ""real spooks!"" Forum on July 5th, 2021 at 6:46pm. EST. One year before The Darkening, when the lights went out, and humanity was never the same.]** 

:

My friends are no longer human. 

And neither am I. 

This is going to take a while. I'm still recovering from.....whatever the fuck.

I don't know. I think I'm going insane.

I thought they were embarrassed by their moon-drunk selves, but no. 

They were playing Silent Hill with my emaciated body. 

The moon's influence has moved past sending them into a trance-like state and acting moon-drunk. This was a whole other level of side effect. One they were trying and failing to hide with smiles and nonchalant faces. And I couldn’t stand it.

I was going to go fucking crazy.

Especially when the three of them were acting like the night before never happened. 

I needed answers.

Why we were replicating and the numbers carved into mine and Rowan’s necks supposedly marking our copies.

Were Immie and Kaz the same?

I wasn’t going to find them staying in that house. Not in my state of mind, anyway. 

Paranoia had taken over like a virus, like a parasite leeching onto my brain. 

Conversations with them turned into a game of cat and mouse. 

Kaz cornered me in the kitchen to lecture me about leaving the refrigerator door open, and I felt… trapped. Like he was going to lunge at me any second, like he could sense my smell, the taste of fresh flesh on my bones ready for him to tear off. 

He looked normal enough, talking like usual, with a brow raised and the slight curve of a smirk on his lips. 

But I didn’t see intense hunger in his eyes. I didn’t see anything predatory. 

Kaz seemed like himself, like the guy I’d been living with for almost two years. 

And somehow, that made it worse. 

That made them good actors. Rowan and Immie were exactly the same, becoming the perfect mimics of the people I had grown to love. 

It was around midnight when I dragged myself down the stairs, shouldering a backpack with everything I could pack on such short notice. Yanking open the door and stepping over the threshold, I sucked in the cool night air. Before I could step out, however, a chuckle startled me.

Rowan. Standing in his robe, dark brown curls sticking up everywhere, he regarded me with dark eyes, and just for a moment, I wondered if he was going to drop the act.

Out of the three of them, Rowan was the one who struggled most with the façade.

I hadn’t forgotten the look of resentment and hatred he’d given me on the night of the full moon. The real him. 

Relief flooded me at the thought of him giving in and finally ripping off the mask. 
Instead, though, he folded his arms across his chest and took a step forward, still with that smile, a smile I knew was a grimace.

Rowan really wasn’t trying to hide his disdain for me.

Instinctively, I took a step back.

And like clockwork, he took another step forward, and another, until I could smell the coffee on his breath.

“It’s almost midnight,” Rowan said. If he noticed my panicked steps back, he didn’t say anything. “Where are you going?”

“The store,” I replied smoothly. “I need some fresh air.”

Rowan cocked his head, his lip curling. “At midnight?”

The door slammed shut in my face, and I resisted the urge to shriek.

“Yeah,” I hissed out. “I’m gonna get some food.”

“Hungry?” He gestured behind him. “Dude, Kaz just made veggie lasagna. Don’t you want that?”

“No,” I said. “I’m not hungry.”

“Uh-huh.” His lip curled. “So, what are you going to the store for?”

The gleam in his eye was driving me crazy. His whole expression, every contortion in his face, was challenging me to make more excuses.

The conversation was going nowhere, and somehow I could tell he was loving it; he was loving the fact that I was trembling, trying to stay calm, trying to stabilize my body. “Candy,” I said through my teeth. “I’m going to get some candy.”

Rowan hummed, an almost genuine smile pricking. I might have fallen for it if it wasn’t for how close he was standing to me, how he was cornering me. 

“Sweet. Get me some, would ya?"" He winked. ""There’s something about those gummy snakes that seriously slap.” 

He offered his hand for a high five, his gaze flicking to my backpack. He knew.

I knew he knew, and yet he wasn’t saying anything. He was playing with me. 

Rowan’s smile widened. “Hurry back, all right? There are some freaks out there, Nin. We don’t want you getting hurt now, do we?”

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine, and I forced a smile back.

Every instinct inside me told me to run. I had to get out. Away from him. From his coffee breath turning my gut, his erratic movements like he was ready to tear out my throat at any moment. I felt my body moving, my legs starting to work.

One step—and then another. I turned away from him. It took one single breath to reach the door, and another to remember how to grab the handle and twist it.

He was coming after me, I thought, my mind going into overdrive. 

I imagined his footsteps, heavy breath as he wrapped his hand around my arm and yanked me back inside, his teeth grazing the back of my neck. 

I forced my legs further until I was halfway down the path, reveling in the cool night air grazing my arms. When I pushed open the rickety gate which squealed under pressure, I risked turning back, my heart in my throat. 

In my head, Rowan was a monster bleeding back into the dark.

Turning around to face the house, though, there was nobody there. 

The door was still open, the hallway lit up in all-too-familiar golden light. 

But Rowan was gone. 

When I squinted, I could just about glimpse his figure moving back up the stairs in slow, almost defeated strides.

Something held me there for a second, staring at the house I always saw as a home and the people I saw as family. 

Before I turned and finally catapulted myself into a run. 

It’s not like I could go back to my parents' house.

They live across the state, and it was the middle of the night.

I had a friend from class. Sam. We used to be close, but a while ago he started to distance himself, only smiling at me in passing. We went from hanging out almost every day to barely talking, and I figured it was just natural for a friendship to crumble, even if I didn’t want it to. Sam got new friends, and I moved out of my dorms.

I could either turn up at his door and make a fool out of myself, or go back to my cannibal roommates. 

Making a fool out of myself, it was.

Sam lived in a large building with ivy crawling up red-brick. The house was old and crumbling, but cozy. I remembered freshman days, sitting under the late glow of the sun, the two of us spread out on a worn picnic blanket watching the July 4th fireworks in the sky. Before I could hesitate, I knocked three times. 

The windows were dark, so that wasn’t exactly comforting. 

Sam used to leave the door open so I could slip in whenever I wanted. Seeing it locked made my stomach twist.

Sure, it was midnight. Why *wouldn't* he lock it? 

I was frowning at a decaying dandelion when the door opened, and a pixie redhead stuck her head out. I recognized her automatically. Poppy. Sam’s roomie.

I had grown used to her over-the-top smiles and obsession with mini cacti, but this girl seemed like a different person. 

There was something else. Something I couldn’t put my finger on. The girl was fully dressed in a leather jacket over jeans and shirt, her collar glistening from the downpour I’d managed to miss. 

Half lidded eyes drank me in for a moment like she was in a daze before she seemingly snapped out of it, yanking the door open. 

“Nin?” Poppy’s gaze snapped to my feet. 

“Why are you barefoot?” She folded her arms. “Don't tell me you've got a weird fetish.”

I stared down at my feet, and she was right. I didn’t even put on shoes. The worst part is I barely felt the rough gravel between my toes and bare soles. I was numb on adrenaline. I shook my head with what I hoped was a smile. “Is Sam in?”

Something flashed across her face, and it was so fast I could barely read it. Poppy was quick to hide it with a smile. “Uhh, he's kind of busy right now.” Her attention went back to my feet. “More importantly, why are you running around with no shoes on?”

Before I could choke some kind of answer, the girl gestured me inside. “Get inside! Jesus, Nin, your feet!”

I managed a smile, stepping into the hallway. The house was exactly how I remembered it. Homely. Safe.

“Thanks.”

“What do you need Sam for?” Poppy asked, shutting and locking the door.

I shrugged, shivering. I didn’t realize how cold I was until I stepped into warmth. “Just to talk to him! You know, catch up.”

Poppy laughed. “About? You ran across campus to talk?” Her smile was teasing, and I’d missed it. “Nin, have you heard of texting?”

“I’m kind of locked out.”

Poppy’s smile faded. “Ah.” She cleared her throat, stepping aside. 

“Well, you know you’ve always got a home here if you’re ever in trouble.” she gestured over her shoulder. “Sammy is in the lounge.” 

Poppy led me into their kitchen and plonked a can of soda on the table. It was just like the old days. Poppy and I would hang in the kitchen drinking while Sam took a millennia to get ready. “You drink that. I'll drag Sam away from his game.” 

I nursed the can between my hands, rolling it around. *”Game?”*

Poppy rolled her eyes, yanking open the refrigerator with a little *too much* gusto and pulling out a beer. She cracked it open and took a sip through a  groan. 

“Urgh. They're in the middle of a tournament, or whatever. It started last night, and it’s still going. You’d think grown adults would do something more interesting with their time, but alas, I digress.” Poppy set the can down. 

“I’ve been trying to sleep for the last few hours, but they’re pretty loud. I just block them out with whatever’s on Netflix.”

Cracking open my soda, I downed half of it. God, there was nothing better than a frosty Coke. Rowan and I used down bottles of them for our failed Tik-Tok account. We stopped doing it when he had to get his stomach pumped.

“Tournament?” I said through a mouthful. 

I couldn’t help noticing her attire, and her claim about not being able to sleep suddenly seemed dubious. What, had she been sleeping fully dressed?

Poppy smirked and perched herself on the edge of the table. ""Just a nerd game,"" she said dismissively. ""Sam’s friends are quite… odd.""

I glanced at her jacket, still glistening. ""Have you been outside?""

""Outside?"" Her expression crumpled before she realized what I meant. ""Oh. Oh, yeah. I went for a walk."" She grabbed her beer. ""Hey, why don’t we head into the lounge instead, huh? I’m sure Sam wouldn’t mind us interrupting him.""

With a mischievous glint in her eyes, she spun around and grabbed my arm. ""Besides! Sammy’s friends have been here long enough.""

As she pulled me into the lounge, I caught a fleeting glimpse of... something.

I didn’t see much, just enough to know it wasn’t some typical Dungeons and Dragons game.

Papers were strewn across the table. A group of people, including Sam, was gathered around, one of them marking something on the paper.

Sam’s other housemates were conspicuously absent. When Poppy walked in, dragging me along, the group quickly turned to block my view, hurriedly clearing papers and shutting laptops. 

It felt like I’d just walked into something I wasn’t supposed to see. Poppy, however, seemed delighted by their reaction. ""Oh, Saaaammmyy,"" she sang, leaning against the door with a smile. ""You have a visitor.""

Sam looked different, though I couldn’t put my finger on why. 

His light sandy hair was tied into its usual clumsy ponytail, but the look on his face was one I’d never seen before. 

Flustered, his cartoonishly wide eyes blinking at me like I was a hallucination. 

Like Poppy, he was fully dressed. Sam murmured something to the group, and they quickly gathered stained coffee mugs and bits of paper, clearing the table.

Poppy, now slumped into a beanbag, shot me a grin. ""And then there were three!” 

She stretched out like a cat and squealed when Sam threw a cushion at her. ""We finally have our house back!""

""You know I have the lounge until two,"" he retorted, continuing to tidy up.

Poppy mimicked his voice, her body melting into the beanbag. *""You know I have the lounge until two.""*

""What did I tell you about mimicking me?"" Sam shot her a glare, exasperated.

The girl chuckled. ""Hey, it’s fun.""

""It’s not fun when you sound absolutely nothing like me.”

“Cry about it, Sammy.”

Their back and forth reminded me of my own roommates.

His lip curled into the slightest of smiles, and he picked up another cushion to throw. “Poppy.”

“Sam.” She shot back in a mocking exaggeration of his accent.

Sam’s accent never failed to take me by surprise. Hard Aussie. When I first met him I could barely understand him.

It didn’t help that upon first meeting him, he talked like he’d been fast forwarded.

Originally from Victoria, Sam Fuller was my first friend. 

That’s how we became close, actually. His amusement at my failure to understand him. Poppy folded her arms, her gaze trailing after the group filing out of the room. They were mixed ages, though none of them were Sam’s. 

They all looked to be middle aged to ancient. I glimpsed a woman who looked to be at least 70 stride to the door. “Don’t give me that look.” Poppy said.

“Your weird friends can find another meeting place for your games. I want to sleep. Allie and Tom have locked themselves in their rooms since you decided to invite half of the neighborhood.”

“They’re not weird games. We’re saving the town.” Sam shooed Poppy out of the room. “Don’t you have work to do?” 

“Maybe.” Poppy nodded at me. “I’ll make you another drink.” Her gaze fell on Sam. “Beer?”

He grinned. “That’d be great.""

“Awesome!” Poppy playfully hit him. “Get one yourself. You’re a big boy, aren’t cha? I’ll be in my room!”

Ignoring Poppy slamming the door behind her, Sam’s attention flicked to me. “Nin, what are you doing here?”

I couldn’t help it, the words slipping out before I could stop them. “Who were they?”

Sam dragged his hands through his hair. “Just friends.” His expression softened, and the knot in my gut loosened.

“You look like shit, Nin. What happened?”

I figured telling him a diluted version of the night of the full moon was better so I didn’t sound out of my mind.  

By the time I was finished explaining, the two of us were curled up on his bed in front of his laptop playing YouTube videos on low. Poppy had lent me some clothes to sleep in, and I was ready to pass out. Sam sat in front of me, his arms wrapped around his knees. 

“So, your roomies got you freaked?” He frowned, his sleepy eyes on me. “What did they do?”

Cannibalise my body. I thought dizzily.

No, worse. They weren’t just eating me.

They were replicating me, so they could eat me again, and again, and again, and—

“They were just acting weird.” I said.

“Weird *how*?”

Hours later, when I was falling asleep, and Sam was watching YouTube, he nudged me.

“Nin?”

“Mm?” I mumbled into his pillow.

“Where do you live now? Like, which house?”

“It’s just down the road from here.”

He hummed. “And those roommates…who are they again?”

I didn’t answer him.

I mean, I couldn’t.

Their names were entangled on my tongue whenever I tried.

Sam asked me the same question every day, and the words tangled in my throat. 

I told him it was a prank gone wrong, and that seemed to appease him.

But his expression never seemed to believe me, forcing a smile and nodding. 

Like a parent reassuring a child everything was going to be okay. 

A week flew by in a confusing blur, and I went to class as usual, staying at Sam’s until I could find a more permanent place. 

Much to Poppy’s delight, Sam didn’t invite his friends over again. Instead, he insisted on video games and takeout every night.

It was like freshman year again, and I found myself drowning out the thoughts and questions still haunting me with alcohol and drunk games of Risk.

Classes were more or less the same, but they were a good distraction.

I got texts and missed calls from Immie, and Kaz and Rowan were blowing up the group chat with “?????” messages. 

I muted it and ignored my phone. There would be a point when I’d go back, I thought. After all, I had to know what was wrong with them, why the moon afflicted that kind of behavior, and just what exactly they had done to me. 

But it wouldn’t be yet. 

I can’t remember what day it was when I fully came to reality, badly hungover and feeling sick to my stomach.

Class was ending, and as usual, I filed out of the hall, heading to where Sam usually met me before we went to his house. My head was spinning, a striking pain rattling my skull.

I’d suffered from hangover headaches before, but this was something new. Swallowing two Tylenol with the cold coffee I’d had in my backpack all day wasn’t a good idea. 

Slumping down on the stairs leading to the main reception, I fought against a cry. The pain was like nothing I’d felt before, like someone had plunged a lead pipe through my brain and stirred my brain into a soupy mess. 

Luckily, Sam joined me quickly, his smile dampening when he saw my expression. 

“Oh, man.” He felt my forehead. “You look like you’re going to barf everywhere.”

Despite the pain, I managed a smile. “Do I look like a zombie?”

I could practically hear the cogs in his head turning. Sam dragged a hand through his hair. “Will you hit me if I say yes?”

I shooed him away when he held up his hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

“Fifteen.” I rolled my eyes. I meant to say that we should head down the stairs because I was feeling progressively sicker by the second and felt like I was going to faint, the world around me becoming a blur of colors and faint noises I could barely decipher. 

A sudden loud slam, however, pricked my ears. It didn’t seem to alert the crowd of students, merely a whisper in a room full of loud chatter and laughter. 

To me though, it was a sound I knew all too well. 

Lifting my head, I scanned the crowd enveloping the hallway. 

Sam was speaking behind me, but his voice collapsed into a low buzz of white noise bleeding into my muddled brain. 

I knew that sound. The sound of skin hitting glass, or wood, sometimes plastic. The sound of slipping on a rug, or tripping on literal *air.*  There was nobody else it  would be but my chronically clumsy roommate. 

Which meant he was on campus, and I had zero idea how to confront him about the *cannibalism* thing. 

He wasn't what you'd expect a monster to look like—especially not one you knew had already killed and eaten you multiple times. It was all about perspective. 

To a passerby, he seemed like an ordinary college student, a dishevelled one who had just stumbled headlong into an automatic door, leaving a glaring red bruise in the center of his forehead. 

But to me, Rowan Beck was a monster surrounded by fresh meat. 

The students pushing past him were a blur to me, but to *him*, I caught his gaze drinking each one in, his nose flaring when a guy sauntered past him. 

From a distance, my roommate appeared unchanged, wearing a faded, threadbare t-shirt bearing a logo that had long since peeled away, a pair of well-worn jeans with frayed edges and a patch over one knee.  So much for his *pretentious phase.* 

The glasses were a *choice*.

His dark brown curls were tousled and unkempt, partially hidden under a baseball cap that looked like it had seen better days. But as he drew nearer, I could see his mask slowly starting to crumble. 

His wide smile faltering, twitching into a grimace. 

His cheeks looked hollow, gaunt even. Like something was sucking the life from him. 

Closing in on me, his penetrating gaze hidden behind a pair of raybans, my mediocre lunch crept up my throat. 

I stepped back, scanning for am exit.

And like he had read my mind, his steps quickened. 

He was still wearing that disguise. Still mimicking my best friend. 

Hiding whatever spell he was under.

Rowan oozed broke college student who hadn’t showered in days. 

In his hand was a to-go cup of hot cocoa--which was my favorite. 

Rowan knew that. It had been my  coffee order every time we studied there as a four.  

“Yooo, Nin! Sup!"" Rowan was attracting stares as he sort of danced towards me, tripping over his feet, only for him to steady himself with a grin. 

His words were slurred slightly when he handed me the drink, and he stumbled, managing to right himself. He wasn’t moon-drunk, I thought.

Actually drunk.

“Hey.” Sam nudged me. I noticed he’d stiffened up. “That's your roommate? Rowan Beck?"" 

I didn’t get a chance to reply, with Rowan situating himself right in front of me, swaying a little.

“Now call me craaaaazy!” My roommate said in a slurred giggle. He stumbled again, and this time my hand shot out to steady him on impulse. 

I caught the flash of disgust on his face. Still wearing that smile, he swiped my hand off of his shoulder. 

“But I’m getting the vibe you’re avoiding us! Which is like, sooo rude. You could have just sent us a text, but noooo, you decided to be cool and mys-te-ri-ous.""

I took the drink hesitantly. “Are you drunk?” 

Rowan cocked his head. He had that stupid smile again. The one he pulled during a full moon. Outside though, it was daylight, the sun shining in the sky.  

“Drunk? You think I can get drunk? Nah man, I just feel kinda shit. He shrugged. “I haven’t been eating great the last few days. Not eating can fuck a guy up. Right Nin?”

Every word penetrated like a knife, and suddenly it was hard to fucking breathe.

My roommate turned to Sam. “Ooh, I know you!"" He spread out his arms, a choked laugh escaping his lips. ""You’re the guy who wrote that fucking article about us!” 

Rowan was causing a scene and he didn't give a shit. I couldn't tell if he was moon drunk, or just more insane than usual. 

He jumped in front of Sam, with the kind of manic energy which was still him, and yet cranked to 100. “Loved it, Fuller! You're a literary genius! Especially when you called us ‘evil body snatching demons’ who should be burned at the stake. A truly riveting read.""  

Sam’s expression stayed stoic. “Rowan.” He said my roommate's name like poison. “Where’s Kaz?”

“Playing COD, probably.” Rowan’s lips curled into a smirk. He leaned close to the guy, raising an eyebrow, his words more of a breathy laugh. “Why? Do you want me to pass a message to him?”

Sam stepped back. “Nin, I gotta go."" He said, pulling out his phone. “I’ll speak to you later.”

“Right.” I panicked. “Am I still okay to stay?”

“I’m… I’m busy.” Sam nodded at me, ignoring Rowan, before stumbling back into the crowd. “Come by later, all right?”

He was gone before I could open my mouth.

“Aww, noooo. Don't gooooo.” Rowan mocked a pout, turning to me. 

“Damn. Did he seem… offended? By my presence?"" He waved Sam away with a grin. ""Anyway! Imogen is making dinner tonight. She’s bought all the ingredients for something she saw on Pinterest, so I’m not holding my breath that it’ll be good—or even edible.” 

I didn’t fight back when he slipped his hand in mine, pulling me down the stairs. 

His tone was already puppeteering my limbs. 

My roommate twisted around, shooting me a sheepish smile. 

“Okayyyy, you got me! I should probably apologize for the other night.”

I was already backing away, pulling away from him.

“I don’t care what you have to say.” I said in a breath. “I’m staying with my parents.”

“You mean halfway across the state?” Rowan’s hand tightened around my arm. ""Come on. We just want to talk.”

“Talk?”

That got my attention. Following him to his car parked out front, I slipped into the passenger seat.

I was aware I was following the big bad wolf into the forest, every horror movie cliché.

But what other choice did I have?

I needed answers. Maybe he was finally going to tell me what the fuck was going on. Rowan was still my roommate. 

I had lived with him for two years. I needed to know what was going with them. Why were they like this? And why, according to him, this was my fault. 

Rowan jumped into the drivers seat and started the car, dragging his hand through his hair. “Yeah.” He said. “I mean, once again we left you on a full moon and I bet it sucked. But hey,” He chuckled. “At least you didn’t see us moon-drunk again.” 

My housemate sent me a mocking look, “Wait, did you? Oh, man, what did I do this time? The last thing I remember is playing Monopoly, and I think at some point I cuffed you to your bed.”

Twisting around to face him, my heart slithered into my throat. The bastard was still playing his games.

“You’re still saying that?” I hissed. “Moon drunk?”

Rowan’s gaze didn’t leave the road. “I mean, yeah.” He murmured, “You said we freak you out, so we keep our distance.”

Rowan didn’t speak for most of the ride, and I spent the majority of it trying to find out how to jump out of a moving car without seriously injuring myself. 

My phone vibrated and I pulled it out, glimpsing a text heading my notifications bar.

Sam: Sent: 4:05PM.

“That thing is NOT Rowan Beck. Get out of that house.”

Another message:

Sam: Sent: 4:06PM: “GET OUT, NIN. GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE.”

Instinctively, I grabbed for the handle, pawing for a way out. 

I felt like I was on fire, my body moving closer to the door, leaning into it, as if it would magically fucking open for me. 

“You okay?” Rowan murmured. He slipped off his raybans and turned to me. 

That same gleam was in his eyes, that sliver of moonlight. 

He looked worse without the raybans, bloodshot eyes, a mixture of burst blood vessels and moonlight haloing his iris. 

My roommate looked beautiful and horrifying at the same time, a mixture of human and inhuman; the shell of the guy I thought I knew filled with her. But there was something else, something I didn’t understand. His skin looked… cracked. 

Like it was splintering apart. 

And in those cracks was what I imagined pins and needles to look like. Static. 

There was static leaking from the cracks, spider webbing across his pasty skin. 

Rowan sighed when I couldn’t bring myself to answer. 

“You know,” he said, his hands tapping the steering wheel. ""Eating makes me feel better. It... “ He took a long breath, tapping out a tune. “Well, it takes the memories away, you know? Makes me feel so fucking good.” He tipped his head back, eyes rolling back, like he was in euphoria.

“Rowan.” I managed to get out. 

His eyes flickered shut at a red light. “You would not believe how good the human skull tastes when mixed with intestines. Oh my god, the crunch! It's fucking *insane*. Your skin is my favorite part.""

He tapped a beat with his shoe. ""Damn, you taste good. Like chicken! But a little sour.”

When I grabbed for the door handle, one arm whipped out, pinning me to the seat, the other straying on the wheel. 

He was unsurprisingly strong, his heavy weight restraining me against cool leather. “The flesh under Kaz’s bed is good. I mean, it’s a little soggy and gross on the outside. It’s not peak meat, but it’s tolerable. If you ask me honestly, I’d say I prefer you refrigerated.” 

His lips split into a grin. “And we’re saving those for a good game of Smash.”

“Rowan.” I heard myself say his name again, straining against his arm.

“You said we should talk.” He deadpanned. 

Outside, the world went by as normal, the evening rush hour flying by in a blur of vivid reds and oranges. “So, that’s what we’re going to do.” He whistled. “Talk.”

Words appeared in my throat, but they wouldn’t form on my tongue. 

He surprised me with a laugh. And with that laugh, his façade was shattered. 

He’d finally ripped off his mask. “Why did you have to come downstairs?” 

Rowan finally twisted to me, his lips curled into a grin, his eyes telling a different story. So many emotions. Past emotions. Emotions from a time ripped from my memory. Hatred and pain, anger and something else entirely I couldn’t read. 

“All you had to do was stay in your fucking room, and we wouldn’t have to… have to remember. We could go on living together. You, me, Kaz and Immie. And yeah, when I’m agitated or it’s nearing totality, I start to remember pieces of it.” His voice broke, which was so unlike him.

So haunted, so hollow and wrong. “Why I… why I fucking despise you, Nin.” He was trembling, and when I dared look, his skin was slowly coming apart, a cocktail of moonlight and static pouring out. 

I was frozen. I couldn’t fucking move. Rowan grabbed the wheel with both hands, his knuckles turning white. 

He’d let me go, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. Not when he’d said that. 

Not when his words had stirred something in me. Still though, he kept speaking—like him—the real him—had been silenced for so long, and here he was, letting it all out. 

“She takes all the bad away,” he whispered, a dreamy smile spreading across his lips. “As long as we eat, I don’t feel anything at all. I don’t have to fucking think or breathe, and I can look at you with rose-tinted glasses and a foggy brain. It’s fucking bliss. Like I’m….drowning.” Rowan sighed, dragging his hand through his hair. 

“Not now,” he said. “Now, she’s punishing me because I haven’t eaten.”

The car swerved around a truck, and I fought against my own body, fighting to grab the wheel. But I was frozen. 

“Now, I remember.” His tone was poison spitting from his tongue. 

“She made us remember, and it’s… it’s fucking there in my head,” His voice strained, and he stabbed at his left temple. “Right here! It’s right fucking here, Nin, and I can’t… I can’t stop it. I can’t stop her. She’s in my... my head.”

Rowan didn’t look at me. In fact, he was actively avoiding making eye contact.

Tears were welling in his eyes, hysterical tears leaking that same buzzing black and white static. “She’s in my head. Always in my head. Singing, man. Singing at the top of her voice.”

“What did I do?” I didn’t mean to say it. 

The car swerved again, and I braced myself against the seat. “Rowan, you keep telling me I did something.” I managed. “Why can’t you tell me?”

My roommate turned to me, his eyes filled with that unearthly light I knew he’d been trying to avoid for months.

His smile was suddenly maniacal. Not his. Someone else's. “Because it’s fun!”

This time I did grab for the wheel, trying to shove him from his seat. “Stop the fucking car.”

Rowan easily got the upper hand, grasping it. “No. Like I said, we’re going home. And.. and we’re going to talk.”

It was me who laughed this time. “Talk?” I spluttered. “You mean eat me. Copy me. Whatever you do.”

I couldn’t control my emotions. I laughed. It felt good. ""You suck at being a serial killer."" 

I managed to take him off guard for a moment. He blinked before regaining control. “It’s not… like that. Jesus fucking Christ.”

""Then what is it?” I spat back, days of repressed emotions rushing to the surface. 

“I catch you eating me, and what am I supposed to think? Did you guys seriously think I’d just go along with whatever this is? Are you trying to shield me, is that it?” 

I was laughing, and I couldn’t stop. 

And at that moment I realized we were both under her spell. Both of us were screaming at each other. 

Rowan, leaking her light, and me, bathing in it. 

It hit me, then, that I was as inhuman as him. 

Whatever the moon had done, it was affecting both of us. 

I just didn’t have the cannibalistic tendencies he had. 

“I caught you chewing on what I presume was my *twenty sixth* body! What the fuck do you think you can shield me from?” 

Rowan surprised me with a scoff. “I’m sorry, *shield* you?” He turned to me fully, and I realized, my stomach creeping into my throat, that he wasn’t looking at the road. 

“Are you fucking *kidding* me?” My roommate choked out. “I want you to remember!” He yelled. “Do you think I like looking at you, knowing that you’re completely oblivious about what you… about what you did to us? No, it fucking hurts! You think I *want* to play happy families with you?” Rowan was cracking. 

I wasn't sure if that was good or bad. 

I noticed him inching away from me. 

“That's why I *eat*, Nin. That’s why we eat. She numbs those feelings. Those thoughts. She only makes us think about the good.”

When his hands slammed into the steering wheel, I finally caught a sliver of humanity coming back to fruition on his face.

My hand slipped from the handle, and I heard myself speak. “What did I *do*?”

But Rowan’s eyes were on the road again. He squinted, and reality seeped in. “What the fuck is *that*?”

No longer on the main road, we were heading into darkness, an empty stretch of oblivion I didn’t recognise. There were no signs of cars. I swallowed. “What did you see?""

Rowan shook his head, blinking rapidly. “Nothing.” He said. “I think I’m… seeing things—”

Whatever Rowan was about to say was cut off suddenly, followed by a blinding flash which felt and sounded like the world had been ripped apart in front of us.

Something was there, blinding me, searing my eyes from my skull. 

But I had no time to scream, no time to think or breathe. 

Before I could, my mind was working, and dizzying thoughts were hitting me. 

Our car had hit something, and that something was powerful enough to propel me into the air, my roommate's car shredded apart. The world was shattering around me, my body caught in a whirlwind. 

The sensations were too real, too real to be feeling them. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel this. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel my body being ripped apart, and still be self-aware enough to screech into nothing, a nothing which existed when my head had been ripped from my torso. I wasn't supposed to– 

Exist. 

I waited to die. 

Without a brain, without a body, I waited for the dark. And yet somehow, I didn’t fall fully. Instead of plunging into the dark, my body was still mine. It still had a head.

A torso.

It was still mine when it hit something with a sickening crack.

Concrete.

Dying kind of feels like melting. I was aware my eyes were snapping open for a moment, something wet and warm spreading around me and trickling from my lips. I could taste rust, and I couldn't stop it. My vision was blurry, too blurry to make sense of anything. I watched my eyelids flickering, like they were unsure what to do.

The sky was pretty. I think I tried to name a star, before everything just kind of… melted. 

It was the 28th time I’d died, and this was the first time I really felt it. 

Melting. 

I melted into the ground, my body and thoughts fragmenting. 

Before whatever had taken me choked me back out. 

Death had rejected me. 

After a disorienting moment of *nothing*, trapped between nothing and something, awareness came back to me in splinters, reality bleeding back into focus. I could feel the breeze tickling my back. 

I had…moved.

I was no longer where I’d landed on my back after being propelled from the car in the crash.

Now I was lying on my stomach. 

Something tickled my face. 

Grass. 

I was lying face down on the side of the road.  

I can’t describe the sensation it was to awaken only being part real. 

When I sat up, I felt real. 

I felt like I was part of this universe. 

But looking down at myself, I resembled a ghost, both see-through and not. Prodding at my skin, that same static bleeding from Rowan’s face worked effortlessly, carving my outline and stitching me back together. 

My body was a brand new copy of the me before the crash. 

I even saw the coffee stain on my shirt. The smear of pen I’d drawn on the back of my hand when I was bored in class.

I felt nothing. Like I was made of stars. 

Hollow.

Something was missing, though, a cavern in my mind beginning its purge.

Do you know when you wake up from a dream, and it slips away as you regain consciousness?

That’s what it felt like. Like everything which had happened, the crash, everything Rowan said—was a dream.

Once I felt more like myself, and when my fingertips could touch real objects, wet gravel and grass, my own skin, I shakily got to my feet. I found my old body at the side of the road. I’d bled out, just like I thought. My eyes were still wide open, still struggling to name that constellation. 

When I crawled over to it, I couldn’t resist, grasping hold of her hand, only to get a flash. Like I was seeing her POV. 

She was my old body’s memories. I saw Rowan’s expression, his skin splintering apart, his eyes filled with moonlight. 

I saw him struggling with the wheel, and then the crash. Letting go of her ice-cold hand, I let out a sharp breath, her memories flashing out of existence. I didn’t have time to think about what I’d seen—about the questions piling in my skull, taking over my thoughts. 

Rowan was still in the car, his body twisted like a pretzel, my roommate’s head smashed against the wheel spattered with gore, his brain leaking from his ears. 

“Rowan.”

I stopped shaking him when I realized his spine had snapped, his body more liquid than solid. 

When I felt for a pulse, it was still there, but faint, as sharp red pooled around him, sticking to his hair and drenching his skin and clothes. His head lolled to the side, and I saw and *felt* that final breath escape his lips. When I crawled out of the wreck of his car, I dropped onto my knees. 

There it was again. 

This time it was louder, completely unmistakable. The sound of a photograph being taken.

When that light filled my eyes once again, I turned away from the car wreck, blinking through intense light. It was at the back-end of that sound, the sound of a photo snapping reality and stealing away a moment, when I glimpsed the body seemingly bleeding into existence right in front of me. Like a polaroid coming to life. 

Stumbling over to him, I found Rowan curled into himself, and like me, he was made up of static, which became flesh, which became skin, spreading across him, making a perfect copy, an exact replica of the dead guy in the wreck. 

He was beautiful, like a shadow coming to life, a sketch bleeding into a human. 

Hesitantly, I reached out and brushed dark curls out of the way, hair which was still shadows and shapes seeping into  contorted reality. This time the number 3 was carved into his skin—and by the look of it, the number was fresh, only just coming into existence. 

Did my asshole roommate just *respawn*? 

After a moment of just… watching him, watching my roommate be brought to life, his chest rising and falling, eyelids flickering, lips parting, I got a hold of myself and tried to grab him. 

But when I was sure my hands had made contact with him, flesh with flesh, something smashed into the back of my head, and stars filled my vision. 

I hit the ground, barely physical. Which made me easier to capture. 

I was being dragged, my bare arms burning across rough concrete, before a shadow was looming over me, something cold suffocating my nose and mouth. In the corner of my eye, I glimpsed an adult figure lifting  Rowan into their arms, his body still flickering in and out of existence. 

Before I could cry out, I was forced to inhale, choking on what smelled like lemons. 

Before my body went limp, and I allowed myself to be dragged into the pitch dark.",2,1769902432.0,HFY,2,0.75,False

Mack was sitting there silent and thinking. The lab was quiet, lake wind rattling panes.

He had come to a decision and shared ""I had a brother, Lena. His name was Tommy. It was summer of '98, up at that beach north of here. He walked into the lake one afternoon, calm as Sunday brunch. No currents pulling him. No booze in his system. No note. Coroner called it suicide by drowning. He just kept walking, deeper and deeper, until he didn't come back up. They found him three days later. Lungs full of water. The file's closed, but it never felt solved to me. No reason. No parasite, no poison, just him choosing water over us. It ate me alive.""

Lena's breath fogged plastic. ""That's why this case guts you. Echo of Tommy, but with glowing veins and fish instead of a void.""

""Couldn't save him from his head. Twenty-two years old, big plans for the future.  Like you now. You're three-steps-ahead, never back down, felt like a daughter I never had. Smart. Stubborn. You're someone that I can see myself caring about as much as my own brother. Can't watch someone I care about drown twice”

Voice muffled, cracking once. ""I always knew there was something fatherly under that gravel, Mack. The coffee you grabbed me on the first shift when I wouldn't stop pacing the Tiffany scene. The way you hung back silent during Evan's interview, letting me lead but watching my back. That grunt of approval yesterday when I pieced the fish hierarchy from Selena's tears. I felt it every step this week. I'm a social chameleon for a reason. The foster system chewed me up young. Bounced through twelve homes by fourteen. I learned to read rooms like survival maps, mirror whatever face got me fed. Crack houses one week, strict Bible homes the next. You'd smile at a social worker, snarl at a dealer, vanish into whatever kept you breathing. Your steady face was the first solid thing in this case. It felt like a safe harbor. I never had to shift shapes for you.""

Mack attempted a joke. ""A chameleon that sniffs out leads like a bloodhound.”

Lena smiled at that

“Now you're fighting against a glowing parasite that makes you want to turn into a fish. I can't believe I let this happen” Mack hung his head defeatedly. 

Lena pressed her fist against the glass, glowing dimly. ""Tommy chose. This chooses me and I won't let it win. You didn’t do this, partner but for now Lori-Anne and Marc need you."" Lena said encouragingly.  

Hand matching her in a fist bump through the clear barrier ""We finish this together. For Tommy and for you."" Mack said more sturdily than before.

She nodded, eyes locked as Mack stood and pulled out his keys. She could tell he hadn't given up yet. 

It was time to find the other two whose compulsions were having them dodging cops.

Day 9

Mack prowled the Ashford fringes on rounds, duplexes sagging snow, eyes scanning puddles, runoff. His neck ached and he really wanted to just sleep.

** Dispatch crackled ** ""Lori-Anne is back at her duplex, 142 Oak St. The neighbor heard a loud thud from the shower. Water running.”

Grip tightened. “Two blocks away.” Mack radioed. Tires bit pavement as he accelerated. ""One minute out.""

Mack kicked in the front door, steam billowing through the air from the bathroom. He heard the shower hissing. Mack rushed into the bathroom, boots slipping on tile. Lori-Anne was slumped against the wall, pruned white shoulders, blue pulsating through her body where the water ran down. She collapsed with the sprayer in hand as if she had been trying to force it down her throat and passed out. Oddly enough, that might be the only reason she hadn't died already. Her lips were blue-tinged, eyes half-rolled, chest heaved faintly. Mack pulled her limp body out of the shower and did chest compressions. He knew that it could spell infection for him if he tried to do mouth-to-mouth. He did the only thing he could think of and stuck his fingers to the back of her throat. That forced her to vomit up at least some of the water. 

""Lori-Anne! Fight! Not today!"" She convulsed and gagged before coughing up glowing water onto his boots. The water visibly dimmed as he looked at it for a moment.

The ambulance wailed onto The scene and had a stretcher ready for Lori-Anne. Mack barked, ""Contact Dr. Evelyn Roarke. This woman is infected with a parasitic bug. Roarke might be the only person who knows how to treat it. Do not let any of the water get in your mouth.""

Mack slumped out on the curb thinking about how close that was to another death on his hands. 

After a while Roarke radioed ""Lena is stable after one day of isolation so it looks like this cure could work. Her hands are dimming slightly and Lori-Anne's vitals are climbing so we should be able to start her isolation.” She added ""Impressive save, Mack. You hit that thirty-second window like a pro, so next time just make it ‘early’ instead of ‘cinematic hero barely toeing the line between save and tag.”

Mack exhaled hard. One saved.
**Dispatch crackled out again**  ""Marc was seen at the city reservoir acting strange.”
Before he got a chance to even rest, Mack was off again.

Mack's tires screamed across black ice as he raced toward the reservoir, the massive concrete structure looming through swirling snow.

 He killed the engine with a jolt and stepped out into the biting wind. Marc was sitting up on the tank's rusted edge, kicking his feet casually above the dark water below, his posture childlike, as if a boy sat on a dock, debating whether to jump into the cold lake. Snow gusts whipped around them, and a thirty-foot drop yawned beneath him, leading to the reservoir that fed Ashford's city lines.

""Marc!"" Mack shouted, his boots crunching over loose gravel as he moved closer. ""Step back, son! The parasite is messing with your head, but we found a cure!""

The wind tore at Mack's words, shredding them into the storm. 

Marc shifted slowly without looking up, his eyes flickering between brief moments of lucidity and deep obsession. In a soft voice, he asked, ""Can you hear it too, Mack? Can you hear the water calling you to take your first real breath?""

""No, son. I can't hear that,"" Mack replied, edging nearer with his arms outstretched slowly. ""Don't do this. We have proof that you can get better. Lena, my partner, was infected too. She's with Dr. Roarke right now, staying dry for 48 hours. We saved Lori-Anne as well. She's going to make it through recovery.""

Marc lifted his head slowly, his eyes clearing for a brief, human moment. He stood up shakily on the rusted rim of the tank, turning one boot away from the edge toward Mack, a flicker of hope cracking across his face but then a shock of blue flooded his skin violently. His pruned hands glowed with the brightest intensity yet.

He whispered, ""It's too late. The water needs me."" A single shimmering tear rolled down his cheek. ""And I need it.""

He took one deliberate step back toward the edge. With his arms spread wide, he launched himself backward cleanly into the rising mist.

Mack lunged forward with a shout that ripped from his throat. His boot hit a treacherous patch of loose gravel and ice, sending him sliding just short. A hand's length from Marc's trailing shirt. His fingertips grazed empty air.

""Damn it!"" Mack roared skyward. Fists pounded ice.

He had left his moonroof open and someone threw some trash inside and took a dump in his car! 

  
I put my hand to my dick and told him I had to piss and excused myself upstairs. It's always funny when you try to withhold your laughter. I went back inside and couldn't sleep. So I brewed some coffee and kept listening to him freaking out in the open garage beneath. 

  
I kinda felt bad for him. So I went to Trader Joe's later and took some natural sanitizer and air refreshers and left it at his door. I heard the toilet flushing as I turned back thru the halllway.

1qshw6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1qshw6b/adult_relationship_breakdown_need_advice_on/,"Adult relationship breakdown, need advice on getting life on track.","I (33F) have been with my fiance (34M) for 4.5 years. I have two daughters (13,15) from a previous relationship. Their father took his life in 2018.

I had an awful childhood. Raised in poverty by a drug-addict mom, bouncing from apartment, to shelter, to motel room. I had no sense of stability and security. 

Before I started dating my fiance, I was renting an apartment with my girls and had been there for about 10 years. There was a lot of personal trauma tied to that apartment for me, from abuse from my daughters' father, and also being sexually assaulted in 2020. I was looking for a fresh start once our relationship because very serious and we were ready to live together. 

We rented a house for a couple years and eventually purchased a house. The mortgage is in his name because he has always been incredibly financially responsible, had the down payment, and perfect credit. I, on the other hand, am a mess. I have a decent paying job but a bad credit history that I can't shake. What I do have, is skills. I renovated the house myself and turned it from an unfunctional and awkward house layout to something great. I was happy to contribute how I could. 

Now, the relationship issues. We never fight. We have never yelled at each other or called each other names. I have completely envisioned spending the rest of my life with this man. But he is extremely type A. Before we moved in together, he was living with his mom who was an absolute neat freak. She would vacuum the door mat after entering their apartment, she would wash the shower walls each time it was used, etc. I respect that, but I have ADHD and I have a much higher tolerance for clutter than the two of them. I do try my best, though. 

My fiance is unhappy with messes from my daughters. These messes include some spills on the stove after they cook a meal, or dishes left on the counter, etc. 

He views it as blatant disrespect, whereas I view it as simple forgetfulness and laziness. I make them clean it anyway, as it is their responsibility. 

But recently, he has become outright enraged by my 13 year old sitting in the living room to just hang out. We rarely use the living room, besides drinking our coffee on weekend mornings because we work so much, and have other hobbies.

I told him that I refuse to banish my daughter to the bedroom. She has zero friends at school, and she is likely craving social interaction. I am glad that she feels safe in the living room and isn't a bedroom kid. He said that he wants to live alone.

I'm heartbroken that this has resulted in us separating, but it's clear that our lifestyles don't mesh as well as we thought they did. 

I don't know what else I can do now though. Apartments in my small town are so expensive, I worry that even if I could afford one, I won't be approved because of my past credit issues. I can't move to a different town because of the school zones. I don't have family or friends that I can depend on. My dad passed away in 2020 and my mom is a mess. I have one friend who lives in the tiniest apartment with her 3 kids. 

I feel like such a failure. I don't even know what advice I'm asking for, maybe just a general direction to head into?

I'm overwhelmed and scared to take the first step. ",3,1769902281.0,LifeAdvice,4,1.0,False

1qshv7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1qshv7z/dead_love/,Dead Love,"The cold morning of July 1st, with the humidity's condensation turned into hoarfrost, appeared as a blurry clue that something in the world, or in me, was beginning to twist. The frost clung to the rooftops and the dry leaves in the garden, covering everything with a delicacy that did invite touch. I opened the window and my breath became visible, as if the body were trying to expel something the soul no longer held.
After a steaming cup of black coffee and two slices of toast without jam—an odd lapse for me, who used to spread it to the edges with a devotion that now seemed ridiculous—after an agony that yielded neither to sentimentality nor fear, I knew it had broken: My love for her was dead.
No resistance. No wrapping it in laments. It arrived like winter, without permission, indifferent to what remained alive.

I sat in silence, hands still warm from the cup, and the body understood before the mind. It wasn't rage. Nor sadness. It was the end, plain and absolute.
The walk to the seminary held something strange. The steps were the same, but not the gait. No music. No greeting to the baker on the corner. No pausing to watch the light filter through the jacarandas on the avenue. The world went on unchanged, but I did not. Even the sun, which used to brush my face with winter's timid warmth, had withdrawn.
Was the world renewing itself? Or was I the one starting to dissolve into another version?
The church I crossed every morning, whose Angelus bells caught me in vague thoughts, did not ring. It was noon—I knew from the habit of glancing at that great bell whenever it tolled. But its bronze stayed silent. Maybe chance. Maybe a technical fault. In that silence, I felt something deeper: as if the universe, vast and blind, were beginning to withdraw her too. To erase her from my reality.

That insignificant break hurt more than any reproach, more than farewell tears. Because I understood, with overwhelming clarity, that the universe doesn't stop. And dead love leaves no void: it leaves a weak flame that lights soul corners only when night falls. It's an idea of that love, stuck there, not wounding but lodged.
“The universe will change, but not I,” I thought, with a melancholic vanity that made me smile. I thought it without conviction, like casting a hook into water knowing nothing will bite.

Sometimes I believe she loved me, but never grasped its weight. My way of loving her was intense, almost religious. And the religious, unshared, becomes unbearable.
Now, with love dead, I can consecrate myself to her memory. Not from hope—which I lack—but from calm. Departed love leaves space for mourning, but also for a new way to live. I have her image, gestures, some laughter. And the silence of that noon without Angelus.
No expectations. No searches. But something in me stays upright. Something that, despite the death, doesn't bend. As if the soul needed to walk on, even without knowing where.

That night, the pain came not as memory but as invasion. It struck first in the soul—a hollowing out, like acid etching bone from within, leaving echoes of her voice in the quiet rooms of thought. Then it seeped into the body: a tightness in the chest that mimicked suffocation, fingers numb as if they'd forgotten how to grasp, a weight in the limbs that turned every movement into labor. It was the kind of hurt that reversed the order of being, starting intangible and ending in flesh, forcing the heart to beat against its own cage, reminding that loss isn't abstract but a slow, physical unraveling.

One day—I suspect that day already exists somewhere, fixed and waiting—I will learn to remember you without this ache, without this inward tearing that still confuses your name with pain. I will pronounce your memory as one recites an ancient word whose meaning has survived its use. I will be able to think of your face without the body protesting, without the heart correcting the thought with its own violence. But when my soul descends, as it always does, into that glacial hell beneath all explanations—a place older than remorse and more patient than hope—I will speak. I will speak to every tormented shade that wanders there repeating its own story, to every demon condemned to understand too late the shape of its error, even to Lucifer himself, custodian of a fallen splendor that still remembers light. And I will tell them of you: of that beautiful girl I once knew how to love with a faith that mistook intensity for eternity, with a devotion that sought no reward. I will tell them how love can vanish like smoke in a closed room, leaving no flame, only the certainty that there was once a fire. And perhaps, in that telling, I will understand that what died was not love itself, but the illusion that it was infinite.",0,1769902224.0,letters,2,0.5,False

They found Selena  in a rental cabin off Point Road that was too big for one person and too small for all that guilt. The wind off the lake carried a bitter edge, rattling the loose storm shutters.

She answered the door in sweatpants and a faded college sweatshirt, bare feet, hair twisted up with a pencil. Her eyes went wide when she saw the badges, then smaller, glassy with unshed tears. Her hand gripped the doorframe white-knuckled.

""I already talked to the other officer,"" she said, voice trembling. ""About Tiffany and Evan. Please… you think I'm next, don't you?""

""This is a follow-up,"" Lena said, stepping ahead of Mack just enough to soften his presence. ""I'm Lena. This is Mack. May we come in?""

Selena hesitated, glancing over her shoulder into the dim cabin like something might lunge from the shadows, then stepped aside. The air smelled like coffee and instant noodles and the sour reek of fear-sweat.

They sat at the small table by the window. A half-finished mug cooled in front of Selena. Her hands shook as she pushed it away. This is something that Lena made a note of. 

""They're all dead. Tiffany waterboarded in her tub. Evan when he was in custody. Becca facedown in her sink. It's not an accident. Someone's torturing them right?""

""Selena,"" Lena said gently, leaning in. ""You're safe. There are no signs of foul play at the scenes. No restraints, no struggle, no bruising. These look like drownings where they went in willingly. Walk us through the pool. Help us see it through your eyes.""

Selena exhaled shakily, some tension easing from her shoulders, breath steadying. 

""Okay… you were with them at the pool. Seven of you in total, correct?"" Lena asked calmly.

Selena nodded then started to speak ""Harlan was there, the ranger,"" she said, voice still shaky. ""Told us not to swim, unstable chemistry, bad ground. Travis joked, calling it something stupid like  witch soup maybe?""

""And when you got there?"" Lena asked, voice even, anchoring.

""Tiffany had this shot list,"" Selena said, hugging her arms, eyes distant and wet. ""'Winter oasis,' 'forbidden spring,’ ‘a new thermal pond.’ Becca thought it was fascinating. She is… was a science teacher, which is why she was onboard. We took tons of pictures on the edge of the water. At some point Tiffany and Evan got into an argument about how dangerous it was near the edge of the water. Evan stormed off for a little bit talking about how he was getting hungry. Later when Marc showed up he had fishing poles that he must have snuck past the ranger. He and Evan fished out these weird looking fish. They were so sparkly. Travis set up the grill and Becca cooked them up.""

""The ranger said not to swim,"" Mack said. ""Not a word about eating the fish.""

Selena swallowed hard, voice wavering. ""He didn't know they'd do that. Lori-Anne said the scales glowed in a weird way but Tiffany said that’d make for better shots. She ate the most, took pictures between bites.""

""Evan?"" Lena asked softly.

""A couple bites,"" Selena whispered. ""Becca ate some as she cooked and served, joking that she had to test for poison. Travis ate enough to prove that Harlan's warning about their safety was stupid. Lori-Anne picked at hers but said she didn't like that even after it was cooked it still looked a little blue, so she gave the rest to Tiffany. Marc continued to fish for a little while longer before he came and ate some leftovers."" 

“And you?"" Mack asked.

""I don't eat animals,"" Selena said, sniffling, tears welling again. ""The smell alone… Zero for me.""

Lena's pen moved steadily. ""So: Tiffany most, then Travis and Becca, Evan, Lori-Anne, Marc least. You at zero.""

""Zero,"" Selena echoed, voice cracking with grief. ""And now I am the only one that isn't  hiding from the cops or being killed off in some awful way. Do you think it has something to do with them eating the fish?”

""Do you feel sick?"" Lena asked. ""Any urges?""

Selena shook her head, wiping her eyes. ""No. Just empty without my friends.”

Mack slid a card across and spoke up for the first time during this while meeting ""Anything else, you call. We'll watch the cabin.""

Selena took it, hesitating. ""You're sure it wasn't… torture like waterboarding or something?"" Searching for reassurance.

Mack opened his mouth. ""No evidence""—but Lena cut him off smoothly, putting a hand light on Selena's arm. ""We're sure, Selena. Clean scenes, no trauma. You have nothing to worry about but we will still have a cop being nearby until this is all solved, you know,  to ease your mind""

Outside, lake air hit like a slap. Selena locked the door, chains softer now. Lena breathed deep.

""Shaky but calmer,"" she said. ""Samples next.""

He nodded. ""You did great in there. You might be a real pro at the people thing.” Mack stood there for a second and thought before stating “I might know this Doctor who can test samples from the pond. Water. Fish. We take it to her. I'll call her on the way.” 

""Now you're talking my language,"" Lena said. 

The second trip to the pool felt different. Mack called someone and told them to get in contact with a lady named Dr. Evelyn Roarke and to tell her that they would be there later that afternoon.

Overcast sky flattened the world gray. They brought sterile vials, jars, and a long-handled net from Harlan's shed.

The air still smelled like sulfur. The mist rose in lazy threads. The water held that wrong, subtle shimmer.

""Stay back from the edge,"" Harlan said. ""Thaw's made it sloppier.""

Mack skidded a boot in the mud, testing. The bank sagged but held.

""You get the water,"" he said to Lena. ""I'll handle the fish.""

She gave him a look.

""You trust me with the invisible threat but not the wriggling one?""

""Something like that,"" he said.

She knelt carefully, unscrewed a vial, let surface tension break into it. The water slid in slower than it should have. It was clear and faintly opalescent. For a second, it streaked the glass with pale blue that pulsed once, then faded.

""I see you."" she said quietly.

She capped it then moved to collect more 

Mack took the net, dipped into the darker center. Warmth hit his face. Something slapped the mesh. A pale, rubbery weight.

The fish was longer than his forearm, translucent gray skin, huge glassy eyes. Scales threw erratic flashes as it twisted.

""Jesus,"" he said. ""That's ugly.""

""Don't body-shame the evidence,"" Lena said from where she knelt.

He maneuvered it toward the cooler. The fish bucked, tail whipping and it flipped out of the net. As it reentered the water a sheet of the liquid splashed up towards Lena.

She turned at the wrong moment. Droplets caught her lips and cheek. She jerked back, coughing. She spat out most but not all.

""Son of a—"" She wiped her mouth. ""Tastes like witch soup alright.""

""Rinse,"" Mack said sharply. ""Now.""

She dug out her half-empty water bottle, swished and spat twice, then drank a long swallow.

He watched her throat work and felt his stomach tighten.

""You okay?"" he asked.

""Mouthful of sulfur soup,"" she said lightly. ""Definitely a career highlight.""

They got the fish in the cooler, took their samples, labeled everything by the book.

Mack's eyes kept sliding to Lena's face. To the damp patch on her cheek. To her tongue darting to the corner of her mouth.

On the drive back, she drank the rest of her bottle and stared at the condensation too long.

That night, Mack dreamed.

Lena stood at the pool edge, the same place she'd taken the splash. Mist curled around her ankles. She stared down, transfixed.

""Lena,"" he called. No sound came out.

She knelt, scooped water up in both hands. Brought it to her lips and drank deep.

Her skin lit from within. Faint blue glow spread from her mouth, down her throat, blooming in veins under her skin. She smiled, serene. She leaned forward. Her face broke the surface. Bubbles rose. The glow pulsed brighter underwater, rhythmic, hungry.

Mack lunged forward and grabbed air. She was gone.

He woke soaked in sweat, heart hammering. The clock said 3:17am. Outside, lake wind rattled the station windows.

His phone buzzed. Lena.

""Can't sleep,"" her text read. ""Staring at tap water. Stupid, right?""

He typed back: ""Try to sleep. We are headed to the Doctor.""

She sent a thumbs-up. He didn't sleep again.

Day 6

That next morning, before Lena stepped out to meet Mack, washed her hands several times. She stared at the running water for ten seconds too long.

She dried her hands and she ignored the faint glow coming from them. 

She went out and got into the car with Mack. 

Mack handed her a cup of coffee and while taking it from him, she twitched and some of the coffee spilled on her. Her skin glowed in a trail where it ran down. 

""Samples to Roarke,"" Mack said while staring at her hand. ""Now.""

Dr. Evelyn Roarke's lab filled a cramped corner of the university extension building in a town nearby Ashford Lake, concrete block walls scarred by old spills, ventilation hoods wheezing over cluttered benches strewn with open chemical bottles minus their labels. Incubators glowed red through fogged glass beside a half-empty coffee mug perched precariously close to spore cultures, air thick with bleach and acetone over perfectly clean, empty fish tanks prepped in the corner near an ungloved dissection scalpel left dangling over the edge.

Roarke herself stood at a stainless steel bench, already gloved, her dark hair pulled into a careless knot that shed strands across her sharp cheekbones. Her lab coat hung open over a faded band tee-shirt, sleeves rolled to her elbows, exposing forearms scratched and scabbed from god-knows-what. Underneath the damage there were various tattoos. She looked up as they entered, dark eyes bright bright with the idea of a new specimen. A fresh cut above her left eyebrow glistened under the lab lights.


""Samples,"" she said, without preamble, holding out a hand.

Mack set the cooler on her bench harder than he meant to. ""Water, fish, and mud from the pool. Five dead now, all connected to it. Test fast.""

She didn't flinch, just popped the lid and started pulling out containers with quick, careless efficiency. One of the vials slipped from her grip, her fingers were shaking slightly, and she caught it an inch from the floor.

""Graceful,"" Lena murmured.

Roarke shot her a devilish grin, then turned back to the fish in the cooler. “I thought you were bringing me a not-so-expired test subject.” 

She laid it flat, glassy eyes staring at nothing, scales dull. Without hesitation, she grabbed a scalpel and sliced a thin fillet free, dropping it straight into a petri dish. No hesitation. No discussion.

Mack's jaw tightened. ""You're not even wearing the right gloves for that. Those are nitrile—""

""—and they handle fish guts fine,"" she cut in, already pipetting water samples into culture plates. ""I've cut myself on worse than this for reasons you probably would shy away from. Relax, detective.""

He stepped closer, voice dropping into that tone he used on rookies who forgot their vests. ""You cut yourself on that thing, you're drinking lung fulls of water just like our five victims. This isn't your basement science fair. Use the proper kit.""

Roarke paused, scalpel hovering. She pushed her goggles up, finally meeting his eyes fully. Her face held that defiant spark—pretty in a feral way, like a fox that knew it had sharp teeth.

""I don't need a babysitter,"" she said flatly. ""I've published on waterborne pathogens from worse than your mystery pond. If I nick myself, I know the protocol. You want results or you want to play safety cop?""

Mack opened his mouth, then closed it. Lena stepped smoothly between them, water bottle in hand. She hadn't stopped sipping at it since they had arrived. She put her other hand up in that disarming way she had.

""Dr. Roarke,"" she said, matching the scientist's clipped rhythm without copying it. ""Mack's not questioning your expertise. He's seen what this does up close, lungs full of water they inhaled on purpose, skin glowing like it's alive. The fish splashed me at the pool—”

“— are you exhibiting any symptoms that I should be aware of?” Roarke interjected. Full attention in Lena now 

Lena grimaced and continued her point as if she hadn't heard the doctor “If your hands shake from low blood sugar or whatever, we lose you to the same mess. He's just… invested in keeping the smart people breathing.""

Roarke blinked, then let out a short laugh, tension bleeding from her shoulders. She tugged the goggles back down.

""Fair,"" she said. ""Fine. I'll double-glove."" She peeled off the nitriles, swapped them for heavier butyl ones from a drawer, then went back to slicing without missing a beat. ""But if I die of boredom waiting for cultures to grow, that's on you.""

Mack exhaled through his nose, arms still crossed.

""Results by tomorrow?"" he said.

""Optimist, if you want me to work faster, have somebody bring me a living one."" Roarke said, already smearing fish tissue onto a slide. ""Prep the PCR first—genetic markers, basic tox screen. Cultures take 48 hours minimum. Go chase your serial drowners. I'll chase the fish ghosts.""

Lena caught Mack's eye, gave the slightest nod. Message delivered.

They left her elbow-deep in samples, lab coat sleeves riding up again, that fresh cut above her eyebrow catching the light.

The station was quiet on the drive back, the kind of quiet that pressed against the ears. Streetlights flickered past in orange smears, lake-effect flurries tapping the windshield like nervous fingers. Lena sat with her water bottle cradled in her lap, cap off, but she hadn't touched it since the lab. Her thumb traced the rim, over and over.

Mack kept his eyes on the road, but his attention split. Every glance showed him something new: the way her free hand clenched and unclenched, the faint tremor in her jaw, the way her tongue darted out to wet her lips for the third time in five miles.

""Lena,"" he said finally, voice low. ""You're infected.""

She didn't look up. Her thumb stopped circling. ""I'm fine.""

The dash light caught her knuckles as she flexed them. A faint blue shimmer pulsed there, soft but unmistakable, like a heartbeat seen through fogged glass. It faded when she pulled her hand back, but he knew he'd seen it again.

""That's not fine,"" he said.

Her head snapped toward him, eyes wide, not defiant, not angry, but *scared*. The fear sat raw in the corners of her mouth, the way her breath hitched just a little too fast.

""No,"" she said, voice thin, cracking at the edge. ""No, Mack, that's... that's nothing. It's the light in here. The heater. My hands are just cold."" She held them up to her face, turned them palm-out, stared like she could will the blue away. ""See? Gone now. I'm fine.""

He pulled into the station lot, and turned off the engine. The sudden silence amplified the soft plastic creak of her water bottle as her grip tightened.

""Lena,"" he said again, softer but firm. He turned to face her fully. ""The glow. Tiffany had it. Evan had it. They all had it. You saw it same as me.""

She shook her head, fast, almost frantic. ""They all died. I'm not—"" Her voice broke. She pressed her lips together hard, looked away at the dark bulk of the lake beyond the pines. ""I spat most of it out. I rinsed. It was just a splash. A stupid accident.""

Mack reached across, stopped just short of touching her arm. ""The fish splashed you. You swallowed some. That's how it starts.""

""No."" The word came out small, a whisper. Her eyes flicked to her hands again, then away, like they might betray her. ""No, Mack, I can't... I won't end up like them. Staring at water until it pulls me under. I know what compulsion looks like. I can fight it."" Her breath shook. ""I have to.""

He nodded, slow. ""You will. Roarke's got the samples. We'll know what we're fighting by morning.""

She swallowed hard, thumb finding the water bottle again. Her fingers twitched toward it, then pulled back like it burned. ""What if she doesn't? What if it's already..."" Her voice trailed into nothing, eyes fixed on the bottle like it held her sentence.

Mack put his hand over hers, stilling it. Warm skin, no glow. Not yet.

""Then we fight it together,"" he said. ""But first we get answers.""

She nodded, jerky and she didn't pull her hand away.

Day 7

Gray broke over the station. Lena stood at the break room sink, hands under faucet ten seconds too long. Blue pulse bright in veins, rhythmic, demanding. She yanked back, gasping, wide mouthed and ready to drink. 

Mack caught her wrist. ""Lab. Now.""

""I'm fine,"" she lied, voice thin. Eyes flicked to the drip,drip,drip.

He dragged her to the cruiser and they took off for the university.

The lab hummed louder. Lena swayed while entering, hands glowing stronger under fluorescents. Roarke glanced from the microscope with her sharp eyes. ""What are her symptoms?""

""Pulsing and I'm so thirsty. My hands are the worst. I strobe like a dying star. "" Lena said, steadying on the bench.

Mack paced. ""Fish splashed her. It's my fault.""

Roarke waved that off. ""Whether it's your fault or not, she will not die. Let me show you the rats first. This parasite is elegant."" Directing them to a screen set up near the rat cages. 

** Video recording **

Rat #1 got a heavy dose of pool water. Drank obsessively from its dish, pruned fast, lungs heaved, blue glow spread. Drowned deliberately face-down in shallow water.

Rat #2 had no water access at all. Scratched glass hard at first, glow faded after a few hours, stayed alive and weak but stable.

Rat #3 got small, controlled sips over time. Pruning built slow, veins glowed steady, then sudden face-first drown at peak.

""Dry isolation provides a 48-hour cure window,"" Roarke said. ""It starves the neural hijack that drives the compulsion.""
 
** End of video **

Roarke straightened from the monitor, peeling off stained gloves. ""Dry isolation provides a 48-hour cure window. It starves the neural hijack driving compulsion. Rat #2 proved it."" She stated in a slightly annoying self-congratulating way.

Lena's hand pulsed brighter. She swayed toward a beaker on the bench, drawn by its glassy curve, thumb circling her empty water bottle cap unconsciously. Her gaze flicked to the sink drain, then the clean empty fish tanks in the corner.

Roarke noticed. ""You're symptomatic. Follow me."" She stripped fresh gloves, crossed the hall briskly.

Mack tensed. ""Where?""

""I've been turning storage into a quarantine zone since I got the samples,"" Roarke called back, ripping plastic sheeting loudly. ""No sinks. No taps. Desert room.""

Lena drifted after her, eyes lingering on the hallway. The break room door wasn't far. 

Mack gripped her elbow gently but firm. ""Stay close.""

Across the corridor, Roarke worked fast: plastic sheeting stapled floor-to-ceiling, cot zip-tied inside the bare room. Ceiling sprinkler capped with foil emergency seal. Every surface checked. No standing water, no damp rags, humidity sucked bone-dry by jury-rigged dehumidifier humming corner. Lena hovered in the doorway, fingers twitching. 

""Smells... clean."" She said while crinkling her face.

""Desert clean,"" Roarke said, zip-tying plastic doorframe shut. ""You're a vector now it's just protocol."" She shrugged as if she had done this before.

Mack's jaw locked. ""She's my partner.""

Roarke froze and met his eyes steadily. ""Then help her fight."" Gestured cot. ""In. Now.""

Lena exhaled shaky, stepped inside. The door zip tied closed. Through thickening plastic, her palm pressed glass, glow stubborn but faint. ""Mack. Go.""

Mack sat down back-to-glass as the clock ticked on.

1qshsin,https://www.reddit.com/r/tylertx/comments/1qshsin/coffee_crawl/,COFFEE CRAWL,"i haven’t seen this uploaded in here yet but there is a local coffee shop crawl that is (fairly) new and happens twice a year (in january and then again in june/july)! I just went for my first time today and we visited 6 total coffee shops (big shot, crema, likewise, the foundry, brady’s, and enoch’s - all locally owned small businesses). 

so if you’re looking for something to do or looking for people to meet, i think this is a great opportunity for that. it was honestly so much fun. and even if you aren’t that into coffee, the shops do have other options that are non-coffee. 

the owner of big shot was our crawl “guide” and it was so interesting to hear her story. she’s the one who basically set this whole coffee crawl idea up. 

coffee crawl aside, these shops were super cute and i think all of them would be worth a visit or if you need somewhere to study etc etc. just check them out in general 

just keep your eye out for posts about the crawl if you’re interested in that because i believe it will be happening again in the summer. ",7,1769902037.0,tylertx,0,1.0,False
