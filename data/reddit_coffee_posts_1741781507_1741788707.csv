ANYWAY we have some confusion over sweetener brands! I use the stevia brand Truvia at work when I want a coffee. He uses the stevia brand Pure Via at work. We notice that both of these brands say they are keto friendly, both of them have the same ingredients: Bulking agent: erythritol, sweetener: steviol glycosides from stevia and natural flavourings. However Truvia say it is 0 net carbs with all carbs being polyols. But Pure Via says its 2 carbs per serving (2g)?? 

So why do two brands who use the same ingredients have different Carb information? Any help or explanation would be appreciated we are very new to this.",1,1741788600.0,keto,0,1.0,False

I need plans for a defense strategy against the USA crossing into Canada...pronto

ChatGPT said:

Alright, here’s the quick version of the ""Canada Defends Itself"" strategy:

1. Befriend the Weather: Use winter to our advantage—blizzards, freezing temperatures, and snowbanks can be a natural barrier. Deploy Canadian winter gear at strategic checkpoints, making it so Americans will be so cold they’ll lose focus and start looking for hot chocolate instead of military conquest.
2. The ""Sorry"" Defense: A carefully timed ""Sorry"" wave could confuse enemy forces. They approach, and we say, “Sorry, you can’t come through here.” They’ll get so wrapped up in apologizing back that they’ll forget why they came in the first place.
3. Mounties and Moose: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) can lead the defense, riding moose instead of horses for maximum intimidation. These majestic creatures can maneuver through terrain the U.S. military can’t handle. Plus, moose are terrifying when threatened.
4. Strategic Use of Tim Hortons: We’ll scatter Tim Hortons locations at every border crossing. The USA’s soldiers will be so distracted by coffee and Timbits that they’ll forget why they came. And if they’re really into it, we can have some strategic poutine stations to seal the deal.
5. The “Cultural Exchange”Engage with Canadian charm: —offer American soldiers a tour of Quebec with the promise of the best poutine they’ve ever tasted. While they’re distracted by culture, we'll move in our strategic forces. They’ll leave with full bellies and new friendships, so no fighting happens.
6. Bilingual Shenanigans: Use the French language as a strategic weapon. Broadcast all communications in both English and French. The U.S. forces won’t be able to keep up with the language barriers and will get frustrated trying to translate things like ""Je vous en prie, ne touchez pas!"" and give up.Bonus Move: The ""Sorry, Eh?"" SpecialWhen in doubt, just calmly walk up to their leaders and say, “Sorry, eh? But we’re gonna have to ask you to leave now.” It’s impossible to argue with that kind of politeness.Would that work for you?

You said:

God damn it ChatGPT it takes too long to train a moose...every good sidekick knows this

ChatGPTsaid:

You’re absolutely right—moose training is a major bottleneck in any defense plan. We need something quicker, more reliable.Okay, how about this? Giant inflatable beavers—they’re not only iconic but also intimidating at first glance. We deploy them strategically along the border, and the sight of hundreds of puffed-up, inflatable beavers would make anyone second guess their plan.Operation Beaver Storm could be launched within hours, and we can even use them as decoys to confuse the enemy. That’ll give us plenty of time to put the real strategy in motion. Do you think this works better? No moose training required!

*So there you have it:*

Moreau led the way through the corridors of the Aegis, moving at a steady, unhurried pace. The Cadets followed in near-perfect formation, their steps measured, precise. Lórien, in contrast, trailed behind them with an air of whimsical curiosity, taking in everything with those bright, unblinking golden eyes.

Moreau was too tired to question why she was still here.

The Officer’s Mess was quieter than the general mess hall. It was a space for senior staff, ranking officers, and select personnel—one of the few places on the ship where things were supposed to be civilized.

Moreau had a bad feeling that would not last long.

The moment they entered, conversations dipped. Not because of him—Moreau was well known here, and his presence barely warranted a glance. But the Imperials? That was something new.

Eyes flickered toward the three white-clad Cadets, taking them in with wary curiosity. Unlike the Dominion, where rigid hierarchy dictated everything, the Terran Alliance had more fluidity. Rank mattered, but respect was earned, not assumed. And right now, the Aegis’s officers were gauging whether these Imperial Cadets deserved any.

Moreau grabbed a tray and motioned for them to follow suit. The food was standard—nutrient-dense rations, fresh produce where available, and coffee strong enough to make a lesser man see into the void. He took a seat at one of the long tables, expecting—hoping—for silence.

He should have known better.

Primus leaned forward first, resting his elbows on the table, fingers loosely clasped together. His blood-red eyes gleamed with interest. “Tell me, High Envoy… how many wars have you fought in?”

Moreau took a sip of his coffee. “Enough.”

Primus smirked. “And your personal kill count?”

Moreau arched a brow. “I don’t keep track.”

Primus scoffed, clearly unimpressed by that answer. “A pity. I thought you would value your accomplishments more.”

Moreau exhaled slowly through his nose before taking a sip of coffee. *This is going to be a long meal.*

Secundus, seated beside Primus, was far more direct. “What is the extent of your authority?”

“Extensive,” Moreau said dryly.

Secundus narrowed her eyes. “Elaborate.”

“I answer to my superiors in the Diplomatic Corps, but in my role, I have significant operational freedom. I can broker treaties, declare conflicts, and, if necessary, execute military action in the name of the Terran Alliance.”

Secundus nodded, absorbing this information. “And your strategic philosophy?”

“Win, preferably without losing any soldiers.”

She blinked. “That’s it?”

Moreau shrugged. “That’s all that matters.”

Secundus frowned, but before she could push further, Tertius, who had been uncharacteristically quiet, spoke up.

“What is your favorite food?”

Moreau paused mid-sip. “…What?”

Tertius stared at him with unsettling neutrality. “Your favorite food.”

Moreau sighed. “Steak.”

“What color and size are your shoes?”

Moreau looked down. “Black… size thirteen.”

“What color is your undershirt?”

Moreau narrowed his eyes. “Also black.”

Tertius nodded as if this was deeply important to some question or equation.

Then, with the same neutral tone, the same blank expression, he asked—

“Are you mating with your AI?”

Moreau choked on his coffee.

For a split second, he nearly launched himself across the table. His first thought was to throttle the Cadet, to demand what in the actual hell kind of question that was.

But before he could react further, he noticed something.

The Officer’s Mess had gone silent.

At the far end of the room, Captain Graves had turned her head slightly, her expression unreadable—but Moreau could feel the amusement radiating from her.

Nearby, Lieutenant Shaw who was sitting with several of the Horizon Initiative members had frozen mid-bite, eyes locked on Moreau.

Sergeant Ward, Horizon’s tech expert, who had just happened to sit nearby, was staring into his tray as if questioning every decision that led him to this moment.

Staff Sergeant Holm, Horizon’s demolitionist, had fully stopped eating. She wasn’t even pretending not to listen.

Even Lórien—who often played at being detached from human social norms—was watching him very closely, eyes shining with intrigue.

Moreau clenched his fists against the table. “Excuse me?”

Tertius tilted his head. “It is a reasonable question.”

“It is absolutely not a reasonable question.”

Secundus, to Moreau’s growing horror, backed him up.

“In the Dominion, procreation is mandatory,” she stated. “Every citizen must produce a minimum of two offspring to maintain population stability, though more are encouraged. If a Cadet has not chosen a mate by the end of their tenth year, one is selected for them.”

Moreau pinched the bridge of his nose. “That has nothing to do with—”

Tertius continued, unfazed. “Primus and Secundus are both preselected by the government. My case is different.”

Moreau hesitated. “…What do you mean?”

Tertius met his gaze. “I am in a relationship with the previous Tertius. Now the Quartus.”

Moreau blinked. “…Alright.”

“She attempted to kill me thrice. It was unsuccessful.”

Moreau blinked again.

Secundus sighed. “He means that she challenged him in combat repeatedly when he surpassed her in ranking. She lost. The conflict was resolved in a manner… possibly unique to Imperials.”

Moreau’s expression flattened. “Let me guess. She went from trying to kill you to wanting to date you?”

Tertius nodded once. “Correct.”

Primus smirked. “Some of our kind find emotional resolution in combat.”

Moreau dragged a hand down his face. “That is the least healthy romantic origin I’ve ever heard.”

Tertius was unfazed. “You did not answer the question.”

Moreau tensed. “Because it is not a question that needs answering.”

Tertius remained eerily calm. “You and the AI—Eliara. Can you produce offspring through technology? If not, is your relationship for psychological relief instead?”

Moreau gripped his coffee cup so hard it nearly cracked.

And that was when Captain Graves, who had been watching this disaster unfold with way too much amusement, decided to make things infinitely worse.

She leaned back in her chair, swirling her own coffee lazily before speaking.

“Well, Moreau?” she mused, voice utterly wicked. “I think we’d all love to hear your answer.”

Moreau hated her.

The entire mess hall was watching now.

Lórien looked absolutely delighted.

Primus was grinning.

Secundus was still waiting expectantly.

Tertius was calm. Patient. As if his question hadn’t just ruined breakfast before Moreau could even finish his coffee.

And Graves—Graves was taking way too much joy in this moment.

Moreau exhaled, inhaled, then exhaled again.

Then, slowly, he turned to Tertius.

“…I am not discussing my personal life with you.”

Tertius nodded, apparently satisfied. “Understood.”

Moreau thought he was safe.

Then Tertius asked—

“…But is it possible?”

Moreau stood up.

“I’m done. We’re leaving.”

Primus barely stifled a chuckle, somehow his tray was already empty as they all got up. 

Secundus rose as well, though with significantly more composure.

Tertius calmly finished his drink as they took the trays to return.

Lórien, beaming, trailed behind them as they exited.

And behind them, Captain Graves chuckled, raising her coffee cup as a victory salute. “I didn’t hear a no!”

Moreau was certain of one thing.

1j9kfte,https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/1j9kfte/amazon_google_discussion/,Amazon / Google Discussion,"  
I searched through the forum and read a number of comments - many of which where excellent - but not all of which seem to be providing solutions for some of the problems.  Perhaps there are no solutions.  

  
We have had both Alexa and the Google Assistant at different times in our kitchen (the hub of the home) and while we have the Alexa in use presently, we do still have the Assistant in our bedroom.  

  
The Alexa is more responsive and seems to be much better at distinguishing voices, however the Google was providing more robust multi-use options.  I will say that the Google did not know my wife's voice no matter how often she imprinted and it drove her mad.  'Add this to the shopping list.'  'I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.'  

  
As an example - the Alexa seems to only connect to one Spotify account.  We have a family account and when my wife would ask Google to play ""her music"" it would play her liked songs, and conversely if I asked it would play mine.  With the Alexa it is always connected to my account and no one can even play their playlists unless they are shared into my account.  That said we did experience cases where the Google would simply just stop playing music inexplicably which is something we've rarely experienced with the Alexa.  

With Google I can ask it, ""When does Store X on Street Y close today?"" and Google has that answer.  If you ask Alexa you receive an answer like, ""I don't know, but here is what I found out about . . ."" and it's some unrelated site that likely related to the store name.  

With Google I can ask it, ""Is Coffee on sale?"" and it will give me a list of places nearby that have coffee on sale, whereas - again - the Alexa will not do this.  

  
So this is not intended as a complaining post but rather as a question to others - have you solved for these shortcomings that we're finding?  If Google were more responsive and better at recognizing voices, I think we'd use it.  If I could get Alexa to provide more local information about shopping or stores and if it handled multi-user music accounts on Spotify better, we'd prefer it.  It is a better device.

I got such an ugly DM yesterday and that person is now blocked.

He or she told me how disgusting my post was yesterday, that I'm a ho, and my parents should be arrested for child abuse and neglect. Maybe this person is the one who keeps calling ACS on me and my friends. Maybe this is the person who can't wait to downvote every post I put up.

Some points for this person. Get real. About 20% of girls are sexually active at age 15 and over 30% are at age 16. 50% are by 17. Call ACS on all of them? In most of Europe, the age of consent is 13. In much of the world the age of consent is lower.

There is nothing dirty about me. I am not promiscuous. Most likely I will only have one partner for my entire life. And I am deeply in love with him and will go to the end of the earth to make him happy and build a beautiful family.

Norms are different according to where people live and their cultures. My parents had both me and my brother at my age. There are many ""under the radar"" marriages in the community where I live now and go to school. And I see a lot more fidelity and happiness in families here than I ever saw anywhere else.

So grow up, Little Man or Little Woman. Stop obsessing about a group of 4 teenagers. Can't you find something better to do in your life?

I’ve seen the headlines. I’ve read the horror stories. But this isn’t that. This isn’t some government experiment gone wrong, some cursed object, some cosmic punishment for my hubris.
 
It was just a pill.
 
One pill.
 
I wasn’t trying to become Superman. I wasn’t looking for anything crazy—just a little edge. A **boost**. Something to tip the scales in my favor for once.
 
I’ve always been weak. Not sickly, not fragile, just… **less**. The kind of guy who gets nudged in a crowded bar and spills his drink. The guy who gets the short end of the stick in pickup games, in work politics, in life.
 
And it was fine. I’d accepted it. Until I didn’t.
 
I found the supplement late one night, scrolling on my phone after another long day of being **overlooked**. An ad buried in some fitness forum:
 
**""UNLOCK YOUR TRUE POTENTIAL. SCIENCE-BACKED. SAFE. NO SIDE EFFECTS.""**
 
A pill that removes the brain’s natural strength limiters. The theory made sense—our bodies can do **so much more**, but our minds hold us back for safety. This just… **removed the brakes**.
 
And I was desperate.
 
So I took one.
 
At first, nothing happens. I go to work, sit at my desk, and cycle through my usual routine—emails, meetings, coffee breaks that blur together.
 
Then, around noon, I feel it.
 
It starts as a hum under my skin. A lightness. Like the world has tilted **just a little** in my favor.
 
I push back my chair to stand up—
 
And it **slides**.
 
Not a normal scoot. Not a gentle adjustment. It **launches**, metal legs scraping against the floor, catching on a coworker’s bag and tipping over. The whole office turns to look.
 
I laugh it off. *“Guess I’m stronger than I thought,”* I say.
 
But inside? My hands are **shaking**. I was scared of myself.

At the end of the day I go to close my laptop, the hinges **snap like twigs**.
 
My boss watches in stunned silence as I hold the two halves of my company-issued laptop, my fingers white-knuckled around the broken edges.

_____________

I tried to shake it off, but the feeling sticks with me. It’s not just the chair—it’s everything.
 
My coffee mug feels **too light** in my hand. When I go to type, my fingers hammer the keys, each stroke heavier than I intend. I try to ease up, but my control feels off, like I’m adjusting to a new body. The letters on my screen are jumbled—nonsense.
 
I backspace. I try again. **More gibberish.**
 
By lunch, my appetite is ravenous. I don’t just eat—I **consume**. My coworkers stare as I finish my meal and move on to the snacks in my drawer. My stomach stretches tight, but I **need more**.
 
The world outside feels sharper, clearer. I take a walk, stretching my legs, feeling a strength I’ve never had before. I test it—pressing against a lamppost, giving it a casual shove. It **groans** under my hand. The metal **warps**.
 
I yank my hand back. My breath comes fast. I walk away before anyone notices.
 
This is good, I tell myself. This is **what I wanted**.
____________

I haven’t slept well tonight. I was grinding my teeth, a habit I’ve had since I was a kid, but this time—it was different.
 
A **snap** woke me up.
 
I felt a huge pain shoot through my jaw. I tasted blood. I sat up, and ran my tongue along my teeth, completely frozen on the spot, telling myself that this did not just happen.
 
**Something’s wrong.**
 
Three molars—**all broken in half**. Jagged edges scrape my tongue. My jaw aches, throbbing deep in my mandible.
 
I swallowed hard, a little too hard. But I think I’m fine. It’s **fine**. Just a fluke. Just stress.

I don’t know what this is doing to me but I am conflicted, I don’t know whether this is a blessing or a curse - but I will keep all of you updated.

Tell us a bit about your Christian journey:
As a pastor’s kid, I grew up in a Christian household (Pentecostal) but I struggled with my faith and felt lost during my teenage years. I didn’t fully understand the meaning behind what my parents were teaching me and thought being a Christian was just about following their instructions and reading the Bible. I never truly considered what it meant to live according to God’s will. At 19, God met me in my lowest moments, and that encounter transformed my life. Since then, I’ve been actively pursuing a deeper relationship with Him and learning to walk in faith.

What sort of person are you looking for?
I'm looking for a Pentecostal Christian or somewhere near, who believes that the gifts of Spirit can happen today (Speaking in tongues and healing) provider mindset, has a heart for God's Kingdom, and ministry. I value someone who is into music, as I am a music head and my calling is in the music ministry. Worshipping together is something I would love my family to do! A born-again Christian who is generous, good communicator and emotionally available. Who can help me grow spiritually. Bonus if you have a healthy lifestyle, love for music and goofy hehe ;D

1. Strategically, what is the best/most cost efficient way to move into the city? (I know these might not be mutually exclusive) 

For context, I live in St. Louis right now. I have a car I plan to sell. I live in the city so I'm familiar with the difficulties of moving into a city street. I was hoping to bring most of my smaller belongings (clothes, trinkets, etc), my TVs, and one or two pieces of furniture. Are pods/uhauls manageable for a small load move in like that? Or should I just bring nothing? If it helps, I am mainly looking at Powelton Village and Bella Vista. (Realize that these are two completely different places as well, but any tips would be awesome :) )

2. I want to contribute to the community as best as I can -- one thing I am passionate about is city history. I am very read up on St. Louis history in the context of redlining and privilege- if anyone has a favorite Philly history book that takes a sociological approach/isn't whitewashed, I'd love to read it, so I'm educated on the space I'm moving into. Any list servs/FB groups/activist accounts I can join/follow to be in the know would be greatly appreciated! I work remote and will have plenty of time to volunteer, so I want to give back as much as I can. 

Ps -- I will know absolutely no one when I move so if there's any club/org recs for a young queer and trans professional, or if any of yall want a nerdy transmasc friend from the midwest to get coffee with, please let me know :) 

Thank you all in advance!! I am visiting next month to check neighborhoods out so I'm looking forward to seeing your beautiful city. ",1,1741785932.0,philly,3,0.67,False

My best friend is a people pleaser. She’s the kind of person who has trouble saying no, setting boundaries, or standing up for herself. She has a huge heart, and if you needed it, she’d give you the shirt off her back. She's the type of mum her kids' friends go to for advice or support, and she always has enough food to feed anyone who might not get a hot meal at home. She's always been there for me too—she was the first to embrace me when I came out as gay. But she has this ex... and he’s a total jackass.

They met when she was 25, and he was 22. It was meant to be a one-night stand, but she got pregnant. She was fine keeping it casual, but he chased her until she gave him a chance. At the time, she was already a single mother of two, not really looking for love because she was already in love with someone else. That relationship didn’t work out—they were better as friends—but then this guy came along, and he moved in as soon as she told him about the baby.

At first, things were fine. They were both unemployed, she had her government single-parent income, and he was on unemployment payments. He smoked pot, cigarettes, drank a bit, and didn’t have any ambition. He was never the kind of guy who believed in splitting things 50/50 either.

They had a few breakups early on but always ended up back together. They got engaged eventually got engaged for 12 of the 16 years they were together

For context, my best friend has battled major depression since she was 19, raising her children as a single mum. And he exploited that. It got so bad that she had to force herself to get out of bed and sit in a small safe corner she’d made in the living room, staying there until bedtime. This went on for nearly seven years, and he offered no support. She went through the motions of looking after her kids, made sure they were happy and healthy, but forgot about herself, or didn’t have enough energy for herself. I visited her a few times a week for coffee, but his presence made me uncomfortable—especially the way he’d stare at my chest.

He was best mates with her brother, who never had a nice word to say about her. Her brother told him she was using him! Especially when, with her support, he got his license back and got a car. Her brother told her ex she would use him to drive her everywhere. So she never went anywhere so she couldn’t be accused of using him. He didn’t contribute financially until the last two years they were together—and that was only because I convinced her to tell him to start paying his way. Even then, all he did was pay for groceries. He told her he was a trained chef and took over cooking, which meant for years their meals were deep-fried chicken tenders, frozen veggies, and mashed potatoes. Occasionally, there was a roast pork, and that was about as fancy as it got. Oh, and he took out the rubbish.

About three years before they split up, he had what seemed like an existential crisis. He left their home for four days, staying at a house up the road without saying a word to her. To this day, she has no idea why. He emotionally, physically, and verbally shut her out. She spent that week crying on my shoulder, utterly confused. I was furious. When he finally came home, he didn’t say a word. He just walked in, waited until the kids were at school, and seduced her. She was too depressed to recognize she deserved better.

After that, he became a completely different person. Without any conversation, he started crossdressing, confusing both her and their kids. The most embarrassing moment came when they were pulled over by highway police after a weekend at the beach. He had to step out of the car wearing pantyhose, short shorts, thigh-high boots, a tank top, and a stuffed bra. The kids were mortified, having no idea what was going on, but they all knew how he had ignored their mother for days, only to change overnight.

She fully supported his crossdressing. Even though she didn’t understand it (because he wouldn’t talk to her about it). She would let him use her online accounts to buy fake breasts, body suits, clothing and wigs. She taught him how to do his nails and hair, found online tutorials for him to learn to do makeup. She defended him (still does) to people who made fun of him for it. She even had sex with him while he was dressed as a woman, even though it didn’t turn her on and made her uncomfortable because it made him happy.

I love her to death…but I hated how she sacrificed so much of herself to keep him happy.

She found him his last two jobs, helped him study to get qualified, listened to him complain about the first job and found him the second job knowing he would be accepted for his crossdressing there. He appreciated none of it.

A year after COVID hit, her Nan died. This was the woman who took her in after she told her about her stepfather abusing her, raised her and saved her in so many ways. My friend was devastated, but she kept it all in, supporting everyone else like she always did. Then, three months later, her ex went to the coast for his uncle’s funeral. My bestie and her youngest were staying in a motel at the time while her public house was being renovated. He’d used her phone to log into his Messenger a few times and forgot to log out. That’s when a message came through, revealing he’d used his uncle’s funeral to organise a hookup. He admitted it, too.

“I was talking to someone who wants to have sex with me because you won’t.”

The thing is, it wasn’t that she didn’t want to. She did. He just kept rejecting her. She was depressed, overweight, and had zero self-worth. It’s hard to feel sexy in that headspace. But she kept trying. She would go to bed when he did, wake up before he did, to cuddle him and try to get him in the mood. She sent flirty texts and organised nights where it was just the two of them. And he ignored it all. And he’d started withdrawing affection long before this—days would pass without touching, kissing, or even talking. His idea of seduction was sliding up behind her in bed and pressing his flaccid penis between her butt cheeks, even when she asked him to stop because she didn’t like it.

He broke up with her because she called him a cheater. He was the kind of guy who would fly off the handle (or punch fridges) if you called him a name (any name even jerk set him off). He thought he was worthy of hero worship and would always threaten to leave if she tried to stand up for herself.

While she and her daughter were staying in the motel, they started walking. She started feeling better about herself and when she finally got to move home, she was thriving.

He had been camping in the yard with her son (who was 15) and the digs who couldn’t go to the motel with her. She had hoped when she moved back home, he would move out.

But he wormed his way into staying with her for another five months. His options were move in with his mother (who hates my friend and their daughter) or my friends awful brother. And he didn’t want to do either of those things. I really think he would still be with her if he hadn’t gotten into an argument with his daughter when they were driving to the supermarket. All she wanted to do was roll down the window because his cigarette was giving her a headache. He stopped the car, made her get out and walk home.

My bestie was livid. Livid. You can shit on her all you want, but if you go after one of her kids she will scorch the earth and dance on your grave.

That was the day he moved out. Shortly after that, she got offered a new house to help her heal from an injury, and the emotional trauma of him. The day they moved, her daughter and her girlfriend took his unc;e's dining table to his mother's house (where he moved to). His mother threw a chair at his daughter. My bestie flew up there to confront her and as she got there, her ex got back from work. He didn't defend his daughter. He didn't tell his mother to back off. He just walked inside.

But for five months, he used her as a bed to sleep in, a body to sleep with and a place to eat. He literally spent all of his time (when he wasn’t working or sleeping) in her laundry smoking pot, masturbating (she found used condoms when she was cleaning up to move) and as a toilet (disgustingly she found buckets of his literal shit and bottles of his pee piled up in the laundry). She threw all of this in his trailer and when he came to get it, he emptied it all into her yard. He’s such an asshole.

He fought her on paying child support until she went through legal channels, berated her for using the money to pay bills, feed and clothe their daughter (which is what the money was for), and from the moment they got together until he moved out, he would take her bank card each payday and use it to buy himself cigarettes and never pay her back. Before he started working, she also paid his weed debts.

So, am I the asshole for what I did? I started catfishing him, just to get some petty revenge for all the crap he put her through. I wasn’t scamming him or taking his money—just stringing him along to make him feel what she’d felt all these years. But the more I did it, the more I saw just how selfish and manipulative he is. He’d put her down at every chance he got, get mad at me if I didn’t reply instantly when he messaged me, and send me videos that, if I wasn’t already gay, might have made me rethink my whole life. It made me realise even more how much better off she is without him. After everything he put her through, I couldn’t just sit back and watch him get away with it.

It wasn’t about scamming him. It was petty revenge—he had hurt her for so long, made her feel worthless, and I just wanted him to feel even a fraction of what she had gone through. I strung him along, made him think he had someone interested in him, but I wasn’t ever going to meet him in person or let him get any closer. It felt like the least I could do after the way he’d treated her—playing with his emotions, just like he’d done to her, but with no intention of letting it go any further. He deserved to feel the sting of his own actions.

He sent me videos that were so gross, I could barely process it. If I wasn’t already gay, I honestly think I would’ve questioned my entire existence. The guy had no boundaries, and the more I saw, the more I realised how much of a toxic person he is. He’s selfish, manipulative, and honestly, just downright disgusting.

I ended up cutting off communication before I could reveal who I was, just to avoid giving him the satisfaction of knowing he got played. But when I think about it, I don’t feel bad. He needed a wake-up call. If anything, he deserves to have a taste of his own medicine.

So, was I out of line? Did I go too far, or did he deserve it for being the asshole for making her life miserable for so long?

On a positive note, my bestie is thriving. She's found work writing for an Australian parenting website, she's written two romance novels, she's finally back in charge of her kitchen and she is the best cook. She's working on her mental health and physical health and is smiling again. Her depression has lifted and even though she still struggles financially (he left her a lot of debt), she's keeping her kids alive and they're all happier without him.",1,1741785830.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

I have never really tried to persuade anyone to do anything. My mind seems to work on a different plane than a lot of people, so I gave up on being persuasive or changing someone's opinion a long time ago. 

But let's pretend it was my job to convert people to a specific religion. I would not go door to door of course. That is a tough sell. As an individual if it was my job to try and convert someone. What I would do is to lead a happy, secure, and comfortable life in my religion. 

I would not try to sell anything. I would not try to persuade anyone of anything. I would just be happy and content in my own life and religion. Then if they feel something missing in their lives, they could look to mine to see what my system has to offer and its appeal. Maybe then they will convert on their own.

Obliviously I am not trying to convert anyone. But it would be nice to have a girlfriend someday :)

It goes without saying that I am horrible salesman. Always have been. I could not sell anything. 

I am not going to try and sell myself to a potential dating partner. I never could do it. I am willing to bet I will never be able to. But that is totally fine :)

I will be super happy and content in my life no matter what. No one knows how to have fun like me. I hate to say I am the best- but perhaps I am. I am a relatively intelligent guy in his late 30s with autism. No relationship yet (not a huge surprise lol). 

But I will be dammed if I am not having more fun than the vast majority of people. People seem to complain about their lives, their jobs, the world around them all the time. I do not see the world that way. I think the world is a wonderful place with a near infinite about of possibilities for fun and happiness. 

My whole point being is I think I am just going to keep living my happy and content life just the way I am :)

I hope it appeals to people. I am very non-traditional of course. But people do not seem super happy in traditional roles. So, I am offering an alternative. A different way of living. A different path to happiness, fun and contentment. 

I know there are a lot of unhappy people out there. I hope at least one of them finds me and gets a little bit happier :)

I never really paid attention… until last October, when I noticed she had way more energy than usual.

Aunt Linda is 61, but you wouldn’t know it. She’s up early, going on walks, and somehow has more stamina than I do. At a family gathering, I finally asked, “Alright, what’s your secret?” That’s when she pulled out a bottle of Moringa Magic and told me she’d been taking it every day for a few months.

She said she originally started using it for joint health and energy, but what surprised her most was how much sharper and more focused she felt throughout the day. She used to crash in the afternoon, but now she barely needed coffee anymore.

I figured, why not try it? So, I ordered a bottle and started taking it in November. And I have to admit… I get it now. I’m not saying it’s a miracle pill, but after a couple of weeks, I noticed I wasn’t as sluggish in the mornings, and my digestion actually felt better too.

Now, I’m curious—has anyone else tried moringa before? I had no idea it was packed with so many nutrients, but I’d love to hear how others use it. Do you take it as a supplement or mix it into food?

Both offer a sophisticated drinking experience, yet they cater to different palates and occasions. Let’s break down their characteristics, flavors, and best ways to enjoy them.

# Origins & Presentation

Sheridan’s is an Irish liqueur produced by Thomas Sheridan & Sons, first introduced in the 1990s. Its distinctive dual-chamber bottle separates the coffee-chocolate liqueur from the vanilla-cream liqueur, allowing for a visually stunning layered pour.

Bajadera, on the other hand, hails from Croatia and is inspired by the famous Bajadera pralines produced by Kraš. It comes in a more traditional bottle but compensates with a rich, nutty character reminiscent of its confectionery counterpart.

# Flavor Profiles

* **Sheridan’s:** The combination of dark coffee-chocolate notes with smooth vanilla cream results in a well-balanced taste. It’s neither too sweet nor too strong, making it a perfect after-dinner drink or coffee companion.
* **Bajadera:** With a hazelnut-chocolate base, Bajadera leans towards a richer, praline-like sweetness. It’s more dessert-like than Sheridan’s, appealing to those who enjoy nutty liqueurs akin to Frangelico.

# Alcohol Content & Texture

Sheridan’s has an ABV of around 15.5%, making it a relatively light liqueur with a silky texture. The way it pours from its bottle ensures a perfect blend in every sip.

Bajadera is slightly stronger, with an ABV of 18%, and has a thicker consistency due to its nutty and chocolatey composition. This makes it a more intense, lingering experience compared to Sheridan’s.

# Best Ways to Enjoy

* **Sheridan’s:** Best served chilled, poured straight into a glass to maintain the layered effect. It also works well in cocktails or as a creamy coffee enhancer.
* **Bajadera:** Ideal for sipping neat or over ice, but it can also be drizzled over desserts like ice cream or blended into a decadent milkshake.

# Which One Should You Choose?

If you enjoy a more complex, visually impressive liqueur with a balance of coffee and cream, Sheridan’s is the way to go. However, if you have a sweet tooth and prefer a richer, praline-infused experience, Bajadera will satisfy your cravings.

Both liqueurs are excellent choices, but your preference will depend on whether you lean towards creamy coffee elegance (Sheridan’s) or nutty chocolate indulgence (Bajadera). Either way, you’re in for a delightful treat!

Which one do you prefer? Let’s discuss in the comments!

1j9jp0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1j9jp0n/i_think_i_realized_something_about_dating_this/,I think I realized something about dating this morning that makes me feel better.,"I am drinking my coffee this morning and thinking. I have never really tried to persuade anyone to do anything. My mind seems to work on a different plane than a lot of people, so I gave up on being persuasive or changing someone's opinion a long time ago. 

But let's pretend it was my job to convert people to a specific religion. I would not go door to door of course. That is a tough sell. As an individual if it was my job to try and convert someone. What I would do is to lead a happy, secure, and comfortable life in my religion. 

I would not try to sell anything. I would not try to persuade anyone of anything. I would just be happy and content in my own life and religion. Then if they feel something missing in their lives, they could look to mine to see what my system has to offer and its appeal. Maybe then they will convert on their own.

Obliviously I am not trying to convert anyone. But it would be nice to have a girlfriend someday :)

It goes without saying that I am horrible salesman. Always have been. I could not sell anything. 

I am not going to try and sell myself to a potential dating partner. I never could do it. I am willing to bet I will never be able to. But that is totally fine :)

I will be super happy and content in my life no matter what. No one knows how to have fun like me. I hate to say I am the best- but perhaps I am. I am a relatively intelligent guy in his late 30s with autism. No relationship yet (not a huge surprise lol). 

But I will be dammed if I am not having more fun than the vast majority of people. People seem to complain about their lives, their jobs, the world around them all the time. I do not see the world that way. I think the world is a wonderful place with a near infinite about of possibilities for fun and happiness. 

My whole point being is I think I am just going to keep living my happy and content life just the way I am :)

I hope it appeals to people. I am very non-traditional of course. But people do not seem super happy in traditional roles. So, I am offering an alternative. A different way of living. A different path to happiness, fun and contentment. 

I know there are a lot of unhappy people out there. I hope at least one of them finds me and gets a little bit happier :)

I know who I am. I know what I offer. I do not need to sell it. ",0,1741785014.0,Adulting,4,0.29,False

Underneath was an incongruous giant poster depicting a post-apocalyptic world, 'a new exhibition by Pi-casso.' 



A brother and sister sat in the ground floor cafe of the former flour mill. 



'Anyway, we were in Livello when this guy came over, and he was all like ""do you come here often,"" and we were all like ""aye, but why do you need to know?""' 



Johnny yawned, trying to summon the motivation to listen to his sister. 



He might've thought he was adopted if they didn't look similar. Strong jaw, blonde hair, blue eyes. 



'If I'm boring you, Johnny, you just have to say.' 



'You're boring me,' he answered drily. 



'Fuck you.' 



Something had changed when Johnny hit 16– something had switched on, and Frankie wouldn't have minded if it hadn't switched off so many other things she'd liked about him. They stopped going to St James Park, and he sold his PlayStation for art supplies, but what she missed most was the sense of connection they'd had. 



'I saw Mosser,' she continued, 'in the Bridge. He was asking after you. The lads are going to Centurion for Builder's Friday.' 



'Aye, I'll give them a bell.' 



'But will you, John? You said the same thing on the August bank holiday.' 



'I know, I know I was working.' 



She glanced around the cafe at the arty types, a barista with a beard and a neck tattoo who looked like he'd spent 45 minutes that morning deciding what to wear, and a girl with pink/blue hair flicking through a book of Japanese prints. 



'These aren't your people, John.' 



'What people?'



'You know, fannies, arty fannies, you're from Heaton.' 



'I never said they were… When I say I'm working, I mean alone. You've got this idea that I sit here and talk about writing, painting, and interpretive dance, but it's not like that.' 



Frankie shook her head. 'Writing isn't everything. You've got friends and family, and I dunno, the Toon.' 



The coffee coursed through him, making him feel fast and loose with his words. Logic told him that Frankie would never understand; she was simply wired differently, but after all, he was a writer or at least wanted to be. If he could just perhaps string the right combination of words together, they'd open some locked-off part of her consciousness, and it would be like a revelation– a mystical experience. 



'Is it enough for you?' he said, 'friends, family, and the Toon? I need more. I need to be remembered.' 



She paused, a fixed look in her eye. 'You mean like an influencer?' 



'No, I don't mean like an influencer, you knob.' 



She squeezed him under the leg, that bit behind the knee she always could hit since they were kids. 



'You're a vicious get!' 



Frankie pulled out her iPhone for the 5th time that day. 



'You spend too much time on that.'  



'I'm checking my steps,' she replied, 'I've done 10,000 already today for a total of 500 calories. 



'It's better than TikTok, I suppose.' 



'I don't use it anymore.'



'Really?' 



'Well, not today, anyway.'



Johnny laughed. 



'I was looking at cocktail videos before I went out last night, and today all I got are cocktail videos. Nobody needs that with a hangover.' 



He shook his head. 'There's a whole world out there, you know.' 



'So that's why you brought me here today? An art gallery. To civilise me?' 



'Something like that.' 



'Come on fuck face, get the bill,' she said, 'and we'll see what you and your arty pals have to offer.'



'There's no bill.' 



'What do you mean?' 



'You pay what you want, and it all goes to charity.' 



'Fannies,' she said, 'arty fannies.' 



…



Johnny only liked about 5% of what he saw. It was Newcastle's version of the Tate Modern, and much of it was gobbledygook. However, people were quiet, and he could think when he wandered around. 



Franke said, 'I know about Picasso. We did him in art class. Is that what we're seeing? The paella with the cube woman?' 



'No, this is Pi-casso. It's different.' 



'So what does this Pi-casso do?' 



'Haven't got the foggiest.' 



The elevator doors opened on the third floor. It was a separate exhibition. Large abstract prints hung around the room. People shuffled politely from one to the next like they were looking at the arrival and departure boards at Central Station. 



'You know, John, I feel sorry for the lezzers in school.' 



'What lezzers?' 



'The feminist ones.' 



'Jesus, Frank, not all of them were lesbians.' 



'Aye, you didn't see Charlene Moore poking Jade Palmer in the old shower rooms.' 



'What's your point?' 



'I'm saying I felt sorry for them. They gotta hard time, and it wasn't fair, but they didn't help themselves with stuff like this,' she gestured.



The exhibit was called Patriarchy and the Pub Quiz. It was a print of a group of men smoking cigars. Underneath was a manifesto about how pub quizzes were part of the patriarchal structure of society and that there needed to be more questions that women could answer. 



'Honestly, it's not all like this. There's some good stuff. I came to the Van Gogh exhibition here once. They had a kind of retrospective.' 



'The bloke that cut his ear off.' 



'Aye, well, you know he was much more than that.' 



They left that exhibition to get back into the elevator. The city lay sprawled out underneath them. The river, seven bridges, the gorgeous sandstone monument for Earl Grey, the tea connoisseur, and fighter for emancipation. That was what it was to be remembered. 



'Van Gogh has this way of seeing the world. Painting for most painters had been photorealistic; you know reality, you draw reality, but he drew his reality– his madness– and when you look at one of his paintings, it's like you're communing with him– it's mind-bending emotional telepathy.' 



'So he was mental? Like proper mental? I know he cut his ear off, but he didn't just do it because he'd had too much ket?' 



'Yes, it's fair to say he was mad. He blew out his brains in a field in Auvers-sur-Oise.' 



'What do you think made him mental?' 



The elevator continued to rise– outside the kittiwakes swooped and dove from their perches high up on the facade of the old flour mill. 



'Manic depression… But why was he depressed? Biology, or maybe the time he lived in. Nietzsche said: God is dead. And that's quite a shock to the system.' 



And with that weird kind of intuition that siblings have, he knew exactly what she was thinking. 



'I don't mean there was a body; the old fella from the sky landed in County Durham. I mean, the idea of god. After Darwin and the development of other modern sciences, it became impossible to believe in the supernatural anymore. So there was a massive hole in everyone's life.’ 



'You feel that hole?' 



'Sometimes, but you fill it with stuff.' 



'Like family and whatnot.' 



'Yeah, and the Toon, and Insta and makeup tutorials,' he answered drily.  



The elevator doors slid open, and they were on the 6th floor, where the central exhibit was. 



Johnny absent-mindedly picked up a leaflet on the door. Instead of the artist's face, there was a big question mark. 



The walls were empty. Usually, an artist had numerous paintings to show, but there was only one blocked by a supporting wall. 



An eerie silence pervaded because everyone had gathered in one place. 



The painting was still obscured from Johnny and Frankie, but the people spilled over the edges of the partition, and they pointed up with this shared *look*. 



It was not like how it had been with the other paintings where the eyes were bored and merely looking for something- anything. People were in hushed reverence as if in a church and pointing upward to Christ on the cross. 



Frankie was first to speak. 'I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.' 



Johnny felt the power of the painting tearing through him. This was it. This was art. It was Blake, Bosch, and Van Gogh all rolled into one. 



His hands trembled as he opened the leaflet. 



Something in him fell apart. Each fragment of him was white and vibrating; even after a million years, he would never be able to assemble all these pieces again. 



Frankie edged closer, and Johnny reeled back, dropping the leaflet. 



'What is it, John?' she said, the smile on her face disappearing. 



'It's over,' he said softly and repeatedly. 'It's over.' 



'What? What's over?' 



'The world,' he said, 'the world is over.' 



…



Mosser took a big gulp of Carling as flat as a mill pond. He took another, even though the first had barely reached his stomach. 



The fruit machine chimed in the background. An old fella was feeding £1 coins into the machine as dutiful as a farmer feeding his cattle. The bartender opened the glass wash, and a haze of steam filled the sparse environs of the Black Bull Public House. 



'Frankie,' Mosser said, 'she's worried about you.' 



Johny snapped from his trance and sipped his similarly tepid pint. Mosser shuffled uncomfortably in his chair. He was a boxy heavy-set character with square shoulders and an even squarer head– the head of a labourer. 



'She shouldn't worry,' Johnny replied. 



'I mean, you freaked her out. You told her the world was going to end.' 



'It was just an episode,' he smiled. 



'I haven't filled you in,' Mosser replied, seemingly satisfied with the answer. He really didn't want to get into ‘feelings’, at least not until 5 pints in. 



'Filled me in on what?' 



'The craic.' 



'What craic?' 



'Well, you know Tenty, he was seeing that lass from out Monkseaton way. Well, it turns out someone found her on Tinder, and she says she's in an open relationship. He's happy for other fellas to rail his bird, y'na, it's weird like.' 



'The dating app?' 



'Aye, you've never used it? Jesus, Johnno, you should see some of the minge on there. I mean, I know it's fake a lot of the time, but it's nice, you know, to get lost in pretending.' 



'Delete it.' 



'It's just a fucking giggle. No harm done.'



'I'm telling you to delete it.' 



'And I'm telling you I got a handjob from it two weeks ago…' 



'Do you believe in God? Johnny said abruptly. 



Mosser looked back at him momentarily and then laughed. 'You're having me on, aren't you?' 



'No, I'm asking if you believe in God.' 



'Ah, for fucks sake. So that's what's happened. You've talked to one of the happy clappers at Monument, and they've brainwashed you. Johnny pal, come on, it's all bullshit- you know that. They've got you thinking about no sex before marriage and all that other nonsense.' 



'No, I'm saying that because the company has all this data about you, and they can use it.' 



'Data? What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck does data have to do with a bird?' 



'Forget it.' 



'No, I'm worried about you, pal. This is how they get you. They cut you off from your family and your pals, and before you know it, you're giving everything to some cunt with long hair and sandals.’ 



'Remember that time we were in the PTE, and we were watching Liverpool-Barcelona? Liverpool were 3-0 down after the first leg, and you comes in with that bet that Liverpool would go through. All the lads were mocking you, but you stuck with it. You said you just had this feeling, and then when they scored before halftime, everyone was telling you to cash out, and you said you just knew that Liverpool were destined to win. 



Mosser smiled .' And then Origi scored at the death. I won £500 that night.' 



'Well, you believed against all the odds.' 



'Aye.'



'Well, that's the feeling I have now.'



'About God?' 



'Yes, and that the world is going to end.' 



'How can you be so sure?' 



'Liverpool's record in front of the Kop.' 



The two laughed. And the laughter brought Johnny back from the brink. When you know the world is going to end, it puts you in an interesting philosophical position. All at once, everything has no meaning and infinite meaning.



If everything is destroyed, it doesn't really matter what you do, but then there's a certain beauty in doing anything when you know it's the last time. Laugher- this might be the final time he laughed with his old pal. And it didn't matter if they had nothing in common because their history also held a certain unquantifiable weight.  



'Religious wankers,' Mosser replied, 'I don't know what they've said to you, but they're always saying the world is going to end.' 



'Have you heard of Carl Jung?' 



'Who?' 



'He was a psychiatrist.' 



'Aye, he'd come in handy here.' 



'He believed that there was a kind of collective unconscious, a window that all people share- and it's in dreams and visions, and if you look at something closely enough, you can predict the future. He had this vision in 1913 of rivers of blood sweeping across Europe until World War 1 started.' 



'Aye, and the homeless fella up at the Assembly Rooms keeps telling me that King Charles is an alien lizard in a human's body. Mad cunts see mad things.' 



'Aye, but Jung was right.' 



'Look, Johnno; I'm not a fucking educated man.' He put his mitts on the table. 'But if I was alive in 1913 and saw that Hitler was up to his old tricks, I'd probably think there was a fairly good chance that it was gonna kick off too.' 



There was a lull in conversation as Mosser drained his pint. An old guy sat at the bar in a flat cap was reading the Racing Post. The jukebox rattled. The bloke previously at the fruit machine had put on Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode.



'You still haven't asked me,' Johnny replied, 'how I think the world will end.' 



'Mate, I've learned a valuable lesson in the last few years, whether it's religion, politics, or who should be the new Toon manager. The minute you start asking just adds fuel to the fire, and no cunt agrees anyway, so you're just spitting hot air… I'll live in denial, thank you very much… Now get the pints in.' 



… 



After that, Johnny cut himself off from the world. He wrote all day, barely sleeping.



People came, and people went. His sister, Mosser, and even his parents, and he started just flat-out lying to them after a while.



A month passed in this state, and he only wavered slightly in his conviction, but it came down to one simple fact. It was the first time in his life he had ever been certain of anything. Those lunatics, the ones at Monument, who told you the end was nigh, that was just the flavour of the month. Previously, they thought that vaccines were poison or that the world was flat. 



There was a knock on the door, and he snapped out of his trance. Should he ignore it? His parents had spoken with the next-door neighbour, Mrs. Branno,n to keep an eye on him. If he didn't answer the door to Mrs. Brannon, then the next time, it'd be the police. 



'Open the door, you wank.' 



He took the latch off and let his sister in. 



'Well,' she said, 'I still see you're living like a tramp.' 



She kicked some papers to the side and then dumped the rest from the couch to the floor. 



'Would you be careful with those?' Johnny raised his voice. 



'Be careful how you speak to me, mate, because I'm the only one stopping mam and dad from sending the blokes in the white coats.' 



He had to admire her. What was it Mosser said about her once, 'for a lass, she has balls.'



'So you've done it,' she answered. ‘You've worked out the meaning of life or whatever it is the fuck you're up to?' 



She took a hit from her pink vape pen and scrolled on TikTok. Scroll, swipe, scroll, swipe, phone down, pick up, scroll, swipe. 



'Are you gonna put the kettle on?' she continued. 



Johnny trudged over to the attached kitchen of his studio and flicked on the kettle. 



Frankie shuffled around uncomfortably and pulled a notebook out from under her arse. 'Jesus, John. There's shite everywhere.' She absent-mindedly flicked the book open and started reading a poem, then her expression changed. 



'Is this about Gran?' she said. 



'It is.' 



She read out the opening line and then put her hand over her mouth. 'It's beautiful, Johnny. Why didn't you tell me you'd written a poem about Gran.' The tears mixed with her mascara ran in black blobs down her face. 



A car alarm sounded outside, and someone set off a firework. The clamour from the drunk Friday night crowd was louder than usual. 



Frankie read to the end, and the tears kept coming. 'You know,' I understand, 'she said when she finished, 'why you write. It kinda takes the person outside their body for a while.' 



'What story do you tell yourself about yourself, Frank?'



'You're asking to see my Insta stories?' 



Johnny handed her the warm mug of tea. 



'No, you doilem. I mean in your own head. What's your narrative?' 



'Narrative?' 



'Aye, the more you think about it, that's all a person is.' 



'No, a person is memories.' 



'But memories are just stories.' 



'How can memories be stories if they actually happened?' 



'Take Mozzer. That time he called Frats a daft cunt, and Frats got all offended. If he'd said that to Ali, he'd laugh it off, but Frats thought it was a personal attack. He could say the same thing to both, but they’d interpret it differently. And that's because of the stories they tell inside. So what is truth? Truth is the story we tell ourselves about what we see.' 



'And what's your story?' 



Suddenly, it felt like his room was a cave. They were the first humans to land on the British Coast, and they were huddled around a dying fire at Marsden Grotto- they were the only two people on the Isles and, for all they knew, the whole world. It was them and them alone and the whole howling barbarity of nature outside. 



'I can tell you what the story was. It was to change the world, to become the greatest writer of all time.'



'And now?' 



'To be the last writer of all time.' 



'Again, with that fucking morbid shite.' 



Johnny leaned back. The spell had snapped. 



Frankie's phone buzzed twice. 'That's weird,' she said. 'Facebook has crashed, and so has Twitter and Insta.' 



'What do you mean?' 



'And Google's homepage has changed. There's a prewritten question.' 



Johnny felt the creeping dread. 'What is the question?'



'What is the meaning of life?' 



'Don't click it, Frank.' 



But she already had, and the blue screen lit her face as her eyes scanned the text. She was crying again, but they were different from the tears she'd cried reading the poem. There was a violence to them. 



'God,' she mumbled,'  it's God.' 



Another firework exploded outside, except Johnny knew it was not a firework. A dull orange glow became visible through the window. 



There was a knock on the door, then a banging, before it was flung open. It was Mrs. Brannon in her dressing gown. 



She was howling madly. 'God,' she cried out, 'I have found God.' 



Frankie ran to her, and they embraced. 



'God is…' And Mrs. Brannon went into an ecstatic pronunciation of the divine. 



Frankie's ecstasy turned to anger quickly, and then she read from her phone a different narrative. 



The two women began arguing violently, and the argument spilled out into the hallway. 



His vision had come true—the vision when he'd seen Pi-casso- the world's first artificially intelligent artist.



Whatever algorithm that had created that art had reached a point near the singularity, a position of infinite wisdom. Art was dead, and that was what really affected Johnny, but even that was just a small part of the picture. 



He moved towards the window. The street was awash with people- a great biblical flood of humanity all shouting from the rooftops. Each one knew the meaning of life now; each had touched the face of creation, yet each face they'd touched had been different. 



Every human being on earth knew the meaning of life, knew the mind of God, but the algorithm had told each one a mutually incomprehensible story. 



There was a bang in the hallway; the two women wrestled each other to the ground.



Johnny opened the window and hovered on the precipice as the mad wails of the newly converted pierced the night air.

Here’s my story. I’m short, 5’7 but luckily have an above average face and in very good shape, also successful business and own my own home. I have “dated” women from nyc and surrounding areas  but like many guys, got tired of American women in general. I switched my bumble account a few months ago to a certain Latin American city using passport mode and was amazed by how many likes I got from young, beautiful, fit and successful women. Some of them were models, lawyers, accountants, etc. I matched with a few of them just to chat, not expecting much. They were all super responsive and enthusiastic, something that doesn’t happen here in the states.

Here’s the kicker, one was super high interest. Very fit, gorgeous, 10 years younger than me, corporate accountant. She messaged me all the time, I never put much effort into it since I never expected to meet her, but one day she messaged me saying she wanted to meet me, and I just responded “lol let me know when you book your flight”. A while later she sends me her flight info. I couldn’t believe it. I booked us an Airbnb and told her that if we didn’t hit it off, she could have the airbnb for herself and I’d just go home. She spent the first night with a friend she has here, and the next night I picked her up from the train station in the city I had the Airbnb. She was GORGEOUS. So sweet and feminine. Followed my lead entirely, not combative, no attitude. Very comfortable in her own skin. We got drinks and apps, then went back to the airbnb and had a great night. Very submissive in bed, was down for anything. We must of went for 4 rounds. Next morning she made us coffee and a light breakfast, had more morning sex, I brought her back to the train station and never expected to see her again.

3 weeks goes by, chatting here and there. She says she misses me, told her I’m still busy with work and can’t leave the country. She says she’ll come see me again. I told her that’s up to you. SHE BOOKED ANOTHER FLIGHT. She spent a long weekend with me and we had a great time. I’ll be flying to her country for the first time in a few weeks.

I can’t even get an overweight American women in her 30s with kids in tow and no job to answer a single message on bumble, yet here I have a 22 year old accountant in perfect shape literally getting on a plane and flying 9 hours to see me. It’s insane. After this experience, men literally have to be crazy to ever try dating an American woman ever again. I won’t.",25,1741784728.0,thepassportbros,9,0.88,False

I was fine that day minus slight nausea at night, no big deal. Monday I woke up and the nausea was stronger but nothing unmanageable (felt a little like mild morning sickness tbh). My husband and I went to breakfast to celebrate our anniversary and I focused on protein only (eggs) and coffee.

Got home, seemed fine and then out of no where I was projectile vomiting. Could not stop vomiting the entire day and night and messaged the doctor for Zofran yesterday (it is coming in to the pharmacy today which is frustrating). 

I also had a low grade fever for about 24 hours and was dehydrated which I’m sure caused the migraine. I finally was able to keep down some zero sugar Gatorade and saltines after about a day and a half of only water sips. Now I just feel like I’m recovering from a bad hangover. 

Should I ask the doctor about decreasing the second dose? Does this happen after every dose because I really can’t do this every week. I missed a day of work because I obviously can’t continuously vomit at my desk, they frown upon that, lol.

Any help or guidance would be appreciated! I’m feeling very defeated right now.",1,1741784702.0,CompoundedSemaglutide,3,1.0,False

• Zwei Joboptionen: A (attraktiver, aber erst ein Gespräch) vs. B (weiter im Prozess, aber weniger Entwicklungspotenzial)
• Risiko: B könnte bald ein Angebot machen, aber ich will A zuerst besser kennenlernen
• Frage: Wie lange kann ich B hinhalten, ohne unhöflich zu sein? Und wie kommuniziere ich das geschickt?


Hallo zusammen,

Ich muss hier sehr ausholen, sonst kann ich nicht alles beschreiben was ihr braucht, um mir fundierte Ratschläge zu geben. 
Danke also fürs Durchhalten und Beraten!

Ich bin das erste Mal in meinem Leben in der Bewerbungshölle.
Die vorherigen Stellen meiner 8-jährigen Berufserfahrung kamen allesamt über Vitamin B oder Weiterempfehlungen.

Ich habe gerade folgendes Szenario:
Nach wochenlangem Bewerben und grob 30 Absagen, grausigen Virtual Coffees und LinkedIn-Weirdos habe ich jetzt endlich zwei Unternehmen, die ernsthaftes Interesse zeigen.

Unternehmen A:
Stelle: Key Account Manager
Für mich ist die Stelle sehr attraktiv, weil wirklich gut bezahlt, sie mich aus meiner aktuellen fachlichen Arbeitsumgebung herausholt und ich dort in internationalem Umfeld also definitiv viel Entwicklung erleben würde.

1. Vorstellungsgespräch war gut
2. Gespräch ist terminiert für nach meinem
Urlaub Anfang April

Laut Anstellendem Mitarbeiter bin ich einer der letzten vier Kandidaten. 


Unternehmen B:
Stelle: Marketing und Event 
Bezahlt auch fair und ist ein hochtechnologisierter Mittelständler mit coolen Produkten. 
Allerdings ist die Jobbeschreibung sehr nahe dem, was ich gerade mache und ich habe ein bisschen Angst, fachlich auf der Stelle zu treten.

1. Gespräch war sehr gut
2. Gespräch war sehr gut
3. Gespräch mit Geschäftsführer für irgendwann nächste Woche anberaumt

Habe da ein gutes Gefühl, was meine Chancen angeht. 


Zu mir und meinen Fristen:
Ich hab 4 Wochen Kündigungsfrist zum Ende des Monats. 
Ich bin bis zum 28.03 im Urlaub.
Realistisch kündige ich irgendwann Anfang April und fange zum 01.06 im neuen Unternehmen an. 

Jetzt mein Dilemma:
Ich bin mit B deutlich weiter als mit A und kann mir gut vorstellen, dass die mir noch in meinem Urlaub ein Angebot unterbreiten und auf eine baldmöglichste Anstellung drängen. 
Mein Bauchgefühl sagt mir, dass mir Stelle A besser gefällt und mir mehr bringt. Allerdings habe ich da erst ein Gespräch hinter mir und möchte mir nicht allzu große Hoffnungen machen. 
Dazu kommt, dass A nicht ohne ein persönliches Gespräch im Bewerbungsprozess weiter macht, was ich ehrlich gesagt gut finde. 

Wenn mir Unternehmen B ein Angebot unterbreitet, sagen wir bis zum 25.03, wie lange kann ich das herauszögern um zuerst A besser kennenzulernen und dort abzufühlen wie es weiter geht?
Ich will kein Arschloch ggü den B sein und die hinhalten, aber ich will auch mir selbst gegenüber fair sein und alle Optionen zumindest ausreichend begutachten, bevor ich eine Entscheidung treffe. 

Wie kommuniziere ich all das? Sage ich B, dass es noch andere Positionen gibt, die ich abwarte. Kann ich irgendwie klar machen, dass ich keine finale Entscheidung vor dem 15. April treffen werde oder so?

Ich bin gerade wirklich maßlos überfordert, möchte keine Chancen versauen, Aber auch nicht vorschnell entscheiden. 

Wie gesagt, danke dass ihr durchgehalten habt, eure Meinungen und Ratschläge würden mich freuen. Sagt gerne auch dazu, ob ihr aus Bewerber- oder Personaler/Hiring-Persoektive schreibt, das gibt mir vielleicht noch mal ein besseres Verständnis.

It's nice having all these opportunities open to me from the school I currently attend because of my good grades but I feel like I'll go back to having to get out from under my okay school once I graduate if I want to move eventually or go into government or do something alongside some grads that went to great name schools. I already went to a school that I hate explaining to people for undergrad, I'd kind of like to go somewhere recognized as a good school for law school...not that I'm at a bad school! Great for the market I'm in but I'm not sure I want to stay. Also a lawyer I had coffee with really stressed how elitist the profession can be sometimes and said I should really consider transferring with my GPA. 

No real ties to anywhere else expect for interest in entertainment, IP, and maybe government (I know, a little random. I just haven't narrowed it down yet.) So looking at DC, NY, CA. Very open to DC (so trying for GULC) but if I find myself really going after entertainment I think it's a bad move. I don't want to live in NY or CA tbh but would it be smart to go and make connections and be competitive for the opportunities? I also already have a great federal judicial externship lined up so I hate to jeopardize that but I'd hate to regret not transferring for the rest of my life...

On the other hand, I am confident I can excel in my market. There are entertainment opportunities here, but I want to make sure I'm getting a fair shot at them. I'm worried only CA and NY students are the ones being considered for them. 

Tldr; Great GPA, wanting to transfer because I'm scared of having to fight the lack of prestige of my law school for the opportunities I want. No really clear goal but looking strongly at entertainment for the time being. Don't live in NY or CA and not really excited to move there. Have a fed judicial externship lined up I don't want to break too. I guess I just want someone to tell me I can stay and that I won't be making my life harder in the future by not going to a fancy school when after my GPA ceases to matter...Thanks for any advice...",1,1741784606.0,LawSchoolTransfer,2,0.67,False

I've configured both the pre-filling and the pre-infusion time. As the manual says, the pre-filling time can be configured, I've set to 5 seconds and the pre-infusion time I've configured to 10 seconds. The full shot should start at 15 seconds.

So the issue is: After the pre-filling, the OPV seems to be opened, setting the pressure back to 0 bar. By doing this, puck integrity might be affected. This should do, right? For me, during the pre-filling time, pressure would rise, but when goes into the pre-infusion, OPV should have remained closed leading to a small decrease in pressure during the pre-infusion time, which is not the correct behaviour.

Does anybody knows kf I'm thinking right or wrong? Couldn't find this info in reviews and information online.

I (29F) have been with my fiancé Jake (31M) for 5 years. We were planning to get married next summer and had already put deposits down on our venue. My sister Emma (26F) has always been the golden child in our family. She gets away with everything while I'm held to impossible standards.

Three weeks ago, I came home early from a work trip and found Jake's car in the driveway when he was supposed to be at a ""guys weekend"" camping trip. I walked in quietly, thinking I'd surprise him, and heard noises coming from our bedroom. You can probably guess what happened next. I opened the door to find Jake in bed with my sister.

I completely lost it. I screamed, threw things, and told them both to get out of my house (I own it, Jake moved in with me two years ago). Jake tried to explain that it was ""just a mistake"" and that it ""only happened a few times."" A FEW TIMES. My sister just sat there crying, saying she was going to tell me eventually.

I blocked them both on everything and told my parents what happened. Here's where things get even worse. My parents said that while what they did was wrong, I should ""find a way to forgive them"" because Emma's wedding to her fiancé Tom is in two months, and ""family should stick together."" They actually expected me to still be a bridesmaid!

I told them absolutely not. I'm not attending any wedding where my sister is the bride, especially when she's shown zero remorse. She even had the audacity to send me a text from a friend's phone saying that ""what happened with Jake wasn't serious"" and that I'm ""ruining her special day"" by refusing to come.

Yesterday, my entire family ambushed me at my house for an ""intervention."" My mom, dad, grandparents, and even some aunts and uncles showed up uninvited. They said I was being selfish and immature for ""holding a grudge"" and that Emma was ""stressed about wedding planning"" when it happened with Jake. As if that's an excuse!

I told them all to leave and that I'm done with this family if they can't understand why I'm upset. Now my phone is blowing up with messages from relatives saying I'm tearing the family apart and that I need to ""be the bigger person.""

AITA for refusing to attend my sister's wedding? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills with everyone expecting me to just forgive and forget.",1,1741784520.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False
1j9jiu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrisonersofSol/comments/1j9jiu6/the_factory/,The Factory,"*Hi all! This is my first time posting on reddit, or writing any fanfiction at all! I wanted to start a small series of one offs for the glorious* [Prisoners of Sol](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hwmb7z/prisoners_of_sol/) *by* [u/SpacePaladin15](https://www.reddit.com/user/SpacePaladin15/). *Thank you Paladin for this wonderful story and for giving permission to people to create their own fics!*

I stared at my reflection in the mirror. Seeing the face of my twin brother Thomas. We were inseparable before the ESU. Both of us joined but I chose the command track while he went medical. We both made our parents proud. It was all meaningless now. Once negotiations broke and Earth decided to join the war both of us immediately volunteered. Thomas was serving as a field medic within Prestons company. I was given a mission to establish a hidden military base on this side of the passage. We needed to form some kind of a foothold here that our enemies didn’t know about. 

I heard a beep from the communicator.

“Sir Tepu wishes to speak with you.” I heard my XO say.

“Ugh, I will meet him in the mess hall in 5 minutes” I said back.

“Acknowledged sir” I heard as the communicator went silent.

I forced myself to think about something else. Our small fleet of 5 ships had already been deployed for our mission before the battle of Jorlen started. I wish I was back there at my brother's side. Now when he needed me the most. After what they did to him… what he went through. Oh god I cannot do this. I want to go back so badly but I must press on. Humanity needs this outpost and I am the commanding officer tasked with building it.

I used a breathing technique to calm down. I needed a clear head when speaking with Tepu. He was a Vascar who came along with us to assist with the mission. His knowledge of the area was best after all.

I noticed Tepu at the entrance of the mess hall. However I didn’t stop as I went straight inside towards the coffee machines in the corner. Tepu followed me.

“Captain Patrick, I wish to inform you we have finished performing the tests with the high powered laser communication device. The results proved this human technology is indeed able to penetrate the iron dust cloud within the Tiamu dead zone. This aligns with the calculations of our prediction.” I nodded towards him as I waited for my cup of coffee to fill up.

“Are you sure the zone is devoid of any Asscar?” I asked him.

“Affirmative. It is a communication dead zone. Our historical data is clear that they avoid it. We avoid it too as any malfunction could leave one stranded with no way to get help. I calculate with 95% certainty that it is a good spot for a Human military installation” Tepu replied.

I nodded.

“When will we reach the desired planetoid?” I asked.

“At present course and speed, we will reach it in 5 hours” The Vascar replied.

I went to take a seat at one of the tables and took a sip of my coffee. Holding it in my head and just staring at it in contemplation.

I noticed Tepu was still standing next to me. He annoyed me right now. I wished to be alone.

“Is there something else?” I offered.

“I noticed your behavior change after we got the news from command detailing the events of the battle. Are you presently having some kind of a malfunction? Your performance dropped by 50% and you--” He stopped as I interrupted him.

“Tepu! Look I am not malfunctioning and I do not wish to talk about it. I am perfectly capable and want you to leave me alone right now. Now unless you have anything else to say regarding the mission I would like for you to leave.” I said in a voice I hoped sounded less angry and more authoritative.

The Vascar nodded in the imitation of the human gesture and turned to leave.

I let out a sigh and just stared at my cop. HLaser had very low bandwidth, useful only for text communication. But that was enough for me to be able to talk with my brother. And I just… just didn’t know what I could possibly say to him. I need to be there in person and now for the next god knows how many weeks I can only use damned emojis! I frowned and gritted my teeth. I hated The Asscar! I hated them so much! Why?! Why did I take this stupid mission!

Immediately upon arrival to the planetoid called TX-13 as Vascar labeled. Right in the middle of the dead zone. We noticed something was wrong. Our sensors were significantly affected by the iron dust interference and only when we entered the visual range did we notice that it wasn’t barren. Our monitors now showed some kind of a structure that looked half complete and in the middle of further construction.

“This looks like a standard Asscar EMP production factory complex” He said.

“What?! But you said this whole zone didn’t have any Asscar presence!” I responded.

“We believed so too, I predict that they had the same idea to build it here for the same reasons as we do.” He answered.

I couldn’t believe it. The enemy was using the same tactics to try and hide their weapons production. T-this was our chance. We were 5 ships strong and we didn’t detect any sign of a fleet and the shoddy looking half baked factory didn’t look like it could withstand any kind of assault. After my initial shock and anger subsided a sort of wild happiness surged within me. I grinned showing teeth and looked around the command center at my officers. They had a similar expression as me.

“Those bastards are in for a surprise eh Captain?” My XO said giddily.

“We don’t have to take any chances by blowing them up from orbit. Or we can go down there with several assault teams, tear them a new one and bring back some to be *our* prisoners for a change.” He suggested.

“Captain, we are receiving a weak signal from the surface. They are attempting communication. I think I can enhance it.” My comm officer said.

“There is no logical purpose in talking with them. Captain, I suggest we ignore it.” Tepu said.

Looking around it seemed as if the rest of the crew agreed with that sentiment.

I wanted to open the channel. I wanted to look my enemy in the eyes. I wanted to savor the fear in them before I closed them up for good. No… control yourself. You are not some kind of a sadistic animal like them. Humanity is better than this.

“Open a channel, camera focused only on me” I ordered.

A wave of static was the first thing I heard. Followed up by the image as a ragged looking Asscar came into focus. A sickly looking thin female that seemed to have dark beneath her eyes. But when she saw me her expression didn’t turn to fear. She made a big cheery smile.

“Oh thank the heavens you are organic! We thought the silversheens found us and we were goners! Ah sorry, that's a terrible way to introduce myself. I'm Risa, the Vascar commander of this base” She said cheerfully.

I was taken aback by her demeanor. It sounded like… It almost sounded like they had no idea who we were. But this could be a trap. The Asscar have shown themselves to be deviously cunning. Rage filled within me again as I refused to fall for their ruse. But I closed my eyes and calmed down. I should perhaps play along for now?

“I am Captain Patrick of the human ship Colossus. We were on an expedition to map out this area of space.” I said in what I hoped was a convincing enough neutral voice.

“Explorers! Oh how wonderful. That means that you probably have… Please may I ask that you come down to talk with me? There is a pressing matter that I would like to discuss. And I… would like to talk with you in private.” She said something a bit more serious this time.

“Oh I’m sure you would like that wouldn’t you? We are in a hurry right now but I will think about it” I said to her.

Her expression did show fear this time. Her face features began to show signs of panic and of someone trying to maintain control.

“Oh um… I would very much like it if you could spare at least one hour. It’s um a request that I want to make from you. Won’t be more than maybe half an hour” She said.

I just nodded and signed the comm officer to cut the line.

“Absolutely not sir! No way in hell! It’s a trap!” My XO didn’t waste a second to tell me.

“Tepu… You mentioned that the Asscar do not have tech that can communicate through the void? “ I asked.

“Affirmative. They do not.” Tepu said.

“So what? We didn’t expect them to be here in the first place. And here they are. They are crafty little conniving bastards. They probably have the tech and have kept it secret.” My XO said.

I closed my eyes. I had to think. If they didn’t have any comm capability it is conceivable they were cut off for months from the rest of the Asscar. Then they wouldn’t even know about the humans and the war back home. But it was such a good excuse. The sort of thing they can use to trick us. I hated myself for what I was about to do. This was such a horrible idea after all.

“We have an opportunity to learn more about them if we play our cards right here. We are currently in a drastically superior position. I will take two volunteers to the base with me. Fully armed and in full body combat armor, airtight helmets and everything. If I get captured you proceed with the assault regardless of what happens to me. But I have a feeling a single one of our soldiers could take that sorry excuse for a base.” I said.

“Captain. I do not understand the logic. It is most inefficient. Optimal way for gathering information is to capture prisoners and interrogate them” Tepu said.

“Ah but what if they don’t talk? Do we do the same to them as Asscar did to us? That is what you are suggesting? No humans do not do things this way” I said… despite feeling empty inside. This was me just saying the correct words. Just a robotic regurgitation of human values and morals. The true feelings In my heart screamed my need to hurt them. To get some kind of justice.. To avenge my brother.

“With all due respect, Captain. I do not like this plan of yours one bit.” My XO said.

“Neither do I” I said.

Our craft entered one of their hangars and touched down. The landing pad opened and the three of us departed down the ramp. Privates Kelly and Thompson were at my sides serving as my body guards. Clad in the menacing full body tactical armor and holding state of the art gauss rifles. A bullet from one of those would probably penetrate their tank, the enemy behind it , a building behind them and finally kill someone on the other side.

I looked at the small welcome party. Risa was there waiting for us with that damned smile on her face. I briefly looked over the rest of the Asscar around and couldn’t help to notice they all looked rather dirty, thin and tired. Risa’s smile faltered when she noticed the soldiers behind me.

“Oh I should have realized. I’m sorry if we made you scared of us. I promise we are friends and do not wish to harm you.” She said quickly.

“I appreciate that. But I feel safer with them around if that is not a problem” I said back in a matter of fact voice.

“O-oh that is fine I guess. But you have nothing to fear really… Anyway, maybe we can go to my office?” She suggested.

I nodded and gestured for her to lead the way.

We entered a spacious but rather barren office. There was a sort of a table in the middle with two couches on either side. Risa gestured for me to sit.

“I’m afraid we don’t have much to offer you as refreshments but we managed to scrounge up some of our remaining tea” She said as one of the Asscar assistants put down the cup of the greenish liquid on the table.

I remembered Ambassador Kendall and his death. Anger swelled within me anew. Besides, the drink could be spiked with something.

“No thank you, I would rather not drink it.” I simply said.

Her ears dropped.

“Oh… Yeah that is fine I suppose. Um, could I perhaps speak with you openly? I can’t let this news reach my home planet you see. ” She said, almost frightened.

“Of course. I promise we will keep anything you say to ourselves.” I said now intrigued.

“Well I will try to explain it briefly. Our species the Vascar is currently in a prolonged war with artificial AI servants of our own creation. They just started a massacre one day and took over our home planet forcing us to flee” She said.

“I know” I responded simply.

“Oh, you know about us? Ah I guess you must have made contact with us within the last 6 months. We really don’t have any news from back home on Jorlen…”

“Perhaps you have some news for us then. Anything you can tell us we would be grateful for.” She said a bit more hopeful this time. One Asscar standing behind her looked super agitated all of a sudden. He seemed to have something to say but kept clearly forcing himself to keep his mouth shut.

“Perhaps, but first I would like to hear why you brought me here.” I said. Trying to keep the exchange minimal and in our favor.

“Well um… I’m scared to talk about this but if you know about us then perhaps you know about prince Larimak?” She offered.

I simply nodded.

“We know him, yes” I said.

“Yes, well. You must have noticed how he is sometimes then?.” She said with a nervous smile.

When I didn’t reply for several seconds she continued in a nervous voice.

“Well a-anyway our expedition here was tasked with establishing a base for production of EMP weapons for war use. Perfect place that wouldn't be detected by silversheens. Completely isolated of course. We were told not to start coming back until we could bring in the first shipment of weapons. But almost immediately we had problems with our equipment. The malfunctions slowed us down considerably and our construction slowed down to a crawl.” She continued.

“We can’t contact home from here, and going back for more supplies was not an option… If we a-abandon our mission and return home empty handed prince Larimak would. Well he would execute us for our failure.” She said.

“I see.” I responded keeping my face and voice neutral. *Good .* I-I was enjoying this! The way she sounded afraid and hopeless, it awoke a demon from deep inside me. I found myself reveling in their misery.

“So we pressed on. Working double shifts. Our food supplies dwindled. We started rationing. Eating less nutrition that minimum. Disease started to spread amongst the construction workers. We have to finish this base! We just have to! But we are starving and c-can’t go on…” She said, tearing up.

“Please! You are explorers so you must have come prepared with a big supply of food and medicine for a long voyage! I k-know it will probably force you to return home early. B-but we will share our own knowledge of the area in return. Please give us some of your food. We are begging you.” She said tears were streaming down her face now.

“I will think about it.” I simply said. Oh this was music for my ears. I was savoring the moment. Anticipating the horror on her face when she learned the truth. I was having my revenge wasn’t I? Having these people at my mercy. I ignored the growing knot in my stomach. I ignored the small voice in my head that was screaming from far away *No! Stop this! This is wrong! Is this what your brother would want?!*

“There is a war waging on Jorlen right now you know. You were attacked” I couldn’t control myself as I spurted that out.

The silent Asscar behind her couldn’t take it anymore and stepped forward as I jumped up from my seat in alarm.

The two human guards at my side raised their weapons towards him.

But he slowly staggered now looking me straight in the eyes.

“Is the royal palace safe? Do you know if the damned silversheens attacked the palace?” He asked. His voice carried urgency.

They don’t suspect us at all. Of course they think only the Vascar were behind the attack. They were so desperate and so sure organics would help them that they didn’t even consider us as potential enemies. I found that amusing.

“Yes, the palace was their first target.” I said trying to keep my face neutral. *STOP! STOP TOYING WITH THEM!* The voice in my head said a little bit stronger this time. But another part of me was enjoying this. I felt catharsis. My heart raced as the ragged Asscar now with tears forming down his eyes stumbled towards me, his hands raised as he grabbed me.

“Faro no! Sand back!” Risa said in alarm to the Vascar now holding the front of my suit.

I raised my hand to signal my guards to not shoot the man. I was enjoying this man's pain too much to stop.

“Please please tell me when did the attack occur? M-my little brother works the day shift as the guard there. I n-need to know if he is safe please!” He was begging me now.

That was it… something snapped me out of my stupor. The world came crashing down into focus. My intoxication at their misery vanished in an instant. I was looking at this face. This ugly greasy filthy furred bastard alien face… And I saw myself. I saw what I was doing… I have to end this.

I didn’t respond to him. Looking over directly at Risa I said:

“You are to all gather in the shuttle bay. Leave all your weapons in a pile. We are taking you as prisoners of war. All that will be asked of you is to provide a name and rank. You will not be harmed or interrogated further. We do not *torture* our prisoners. You will be well fed and cared for if you have any medical issues.” I said to the completely shocked and flabbergasted Risa. 

“W-what I don’t understand? Please have we offended you in some way?! I apologize deeply if Faro touching you is unacceptable in your culture. Please we didn’t mean to anger you.” She started stammering.

I gestured to one of my guards and he simply grabbed Faros hand to get him to let me go. A sickening crunch was heard as the male Asscar fell to the ground yelping in pain clutching his broken arm.

Two other Asscar raised their pistols at us. But the female guard at my other side almost leisurely walked towards them as they unloaded their weapons at her. Pathetic bullets bouncing off her armor like small pebbles. She didn’t even bother to use her weapon as she grabbed one by their throat and a snap was heard. The Asscar fell to the ground dead. The other one seeing how the gun failed tried using a knife but it just snapped when it made contact with her armor. A single punch caved in his skull.

An alarm sounded now throughout the compound and we could hear footsteps approaching.

I simply said

“Risa stand your men down.”

She stood completely frozen for a few seconds before she stammered in the intercom

“S-Stand down! I repeat stand down! Do not fire! Do not engage!”

I turned to leave for the shuttle.

“You have one hour to comply with the surrender, we are sending a bigger craft to pick you all up” Was all that I said as I left her unable to form a reply.

I found myself looking at my own reflection in the mirror again. What did I see? Who was I? Am I a good person? Strong emotions swelled within me that I couldn’t even begin to untangle. The Asscar surrendered and we were now turning back with the prisoners. Our original mission was forgotten.

Someone beeped at my door. Last thing I wanted was to talk with someone. But I was the commander I had a duty to perform.

“Come in” I said.

The door opened and Tepu came in. The Vascar of course! Who else had a knack of bothering me at the worst times.

“Captain, may I ask a question?” Tepu asked.

…

“Why did you choose to take the Asscar prisoner? It is most illogical. You refuse to torture them for information and now you have to take care of them costing precious resources and time. You are abandoning your mission just so that we could transport the enemy back. But I don’t understand. Have the Asscar not shown that they do not respect the same rules? What is forcing you to follow them? You humans have strong emotions. Do you not hate what they have done?” Tepu said.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed a nearby lamp and slammed it across the room against a wall. It shattered with such force that its pieces went all around the room causing the Vascar to take a few steps back and put hands up to protect himself.

“I do *want* to hurt them, you stupid machine! I want them to feel the pain and suffering they caused us! That they caused my brother! They ignored every rule of war, every rule of diplomacy. They made you their slaves, tried to wipe you out! Are trying to wipe out humanity now as well! You think what? That we don’t wish to have them dead? That we don’t wish for them to feel the pain? We do! We bloody well do! B-but but….” I screamed at him. Weeks of frustration are just exploding at this moment. I sat on my bed, hands over my face. I began weeping like a child.

“But they… are people. We are people, you are people. They feel the same for their loved ones, they feel the same anger and hate and love and fear… And if we want to have the slightest chance for a good future we HAVE to stay our hand. We have to show mercy and kindness and decency. Because without it we are no better than them. Without it we don’t have the right to call ourselves good people…For our children to have a good future… but Tepu… it is hard… it is so goddamn hard…” I barely choked out as I kept weeping.

Tepu didn’t say anything for a long time but then he finally broke the silence.

“Mikri's observation is that at this kind of time humans need to be shown support. I believe one of the ways humans do this is by giving each other a hug. Captain, would you like a hug from me?” Tepu said in his matter of fact voice.

I couldn’t help but crack a smile at the absurdity of it.  I don’t know if Vascar will ever understand. But I had to have hope that somewhere deep down Tepu did. And this was his best way of saying that.

I allowed the hug, feeling his metal claws on my back.

I know the alcohol content in vanilla extract is normally negligible.

However, alcohol is still a poison and there is no ""healthy"" amount. And the dosage is what makes the poison. Assume one is currently young with no liver disease.

Back to the vanilla extract, if one adds a spoonful of it to their coffee because they think it adds to the taste. Now, that may seem like nothing, but said person drinks like 3-5 coffees a day. Multiply that by 365 for the year, multiply that for probably the next few decades, and in my mind suddenly the ""negligible"" alcohol content in vanilla extract doesn't seem as ""negligible"" anymore.

I know overall this still likely isn't very harmful. I know that. I just am curious though, is this amount of vanilla extract ""damaging"" the liver if one kept this up daily for years, however minor that damage may be? What is the extent of this damage? ",0,1741784434.0,nutrition,8,0.4,False

The Draconian Imperium had ruled unchallenged for seventeen thousand stellar cycles. Their mighty armada of planet-crackers and star-eaters had conquered forty-seven galaxies, subjugated countless civilizations, and turned resistance into nothing but an amusing historical footnote. 

Supreme High Overlord Xix'Tharaxul, possessor of ninety-seven royal titles and devourer of the famous Andromeda Cluster, gazed out from the bridge of his 70-kilometer flagship, the ""Inevitable Doom."" His twelve eyes narrowed as he studied the small blue-green planet on the viewscreen.

""This... 'Earth'... has no unified planetary government, no interstellar fleet, and their most advanced weapons still use *chemical propellants*?"" he rumbled, his voice causing the reinforced titanium deck plates to vibrate.

Admiral Kraz'Thul, bearing the scars of a thousand conquered worlds, checked his data readouts and confirmed, ""Yes, my Emperor. Their defensive capabilities are... primitive at best. We detect approximately 15,000 nuclear weapons, but nothing that could penetrate even our tertiary shields.""

The Emperor's mouth-tendrils twitched in what passed for amusement among his species. ""And yet they refused our demand for unconditional surrender. Curious.""

""They sent back a message, my lord,"" offered Communications Overseer Vek'Pontrix. ""It was just three words: 'Yeah, good luck.'""

The bridge fell silent as the Emperor considered this. After a moment, he rose to his full four-meter height, iridescent scales glittering under the harsh lights.

""They shall serve as an example to the remaining unaligned worlds. Prepare the world-ender cannons. I want this 'Earth' reduced to cosmic dust within the hour.""

None of the bridge crew noticed the small blinking light that had appeared on their long-range sensors. None of them knew that humanity had already begun deploying their most devastating weapon:

Frank was alerted to their existence.

**Just Another Tuesday**

General Williams was having a bad day even before the alien invasion started. The coffee machine was broken, his hemorrhoids were acting up, and his wife had texted that morning to remind him it was his turn to pick up their teenage daughter from her clarinet lessons.

So when the emergency klaxons began blaring throughout the UNSD (United Nations Space Defense) Headquarters, his first reaction wasn't fear or panic. It was irritation.

""Is it Tuesday already?"" he muttered, checking his watch. ""I was gonna sneak out early for the baseball game.""

Lieutenant Yamamoto burst into his office, eyes wide. ""Sir! Multiple unidentified objects have entered the solar system! They're massive—we're talking ships bigger than Manhattan!""

Williams sighed and opened his desk drawer, retrieving a worn manila folder labeled ""ALIEN INVASION PROTOCOL."" It was suspiciously thin.

""How many ships?"" he asked, flipping through the three pages inside the folder.

""Over 4,000, sir! And they're accelerating toward Earth at speeds that violate several laws of physics!""

Williams nodded, scanning the document. ""And have they made contact?""

""Yes, sir! They're broadcasting on all frequencies. They call themselves the 'Draconian Imperium' and are demanding our immediate surrender. They've given us six Earth hours to comply before they, um, 'cleanse our world from existence.'""

""I see."" Williams closed the folder and stood up. ""Lieutenant, I need you to do two things for me.""

""Yes, sir! Mobilize our forces? Launch our nuclear deterrent? Activate the experimental plasma cannons?""

""No. First, find Frank.""

Yamamoto blinked. ""Frank? The... janitor?""

""Yes. Tell him it's time for Protocol Omega. He'll know what that means.""

""And... the second thing, sir?""

Williams grabbed his jacket. ""Get my coffee mug from the break room. The one that says 'World's Okayest General.' This is going to be a long day.""

---

**The Button**

Frank Martinez had been the head janitor at the UNSD for forty-seven years. At 77, he walked with a limp from an old football injury, had a perpetual five o'clock shadow, and wore the same faded blue coveralls every day. His employee file listed his previous occupation simply as ""classified,"" and the few who had tried to dig deeper found their access mysteriously revoked.

When Lieutenant Yamamoto found him, Frank was unclogging a toilet in the men's room on the third floor.

""Frank! Thank God!"" Yamamoto gasped. ""General Williams says it's time for Protocol Omega!""

Frank didn't look up from his plunger. ""Tuesday, huh? Figures."" He gave the toilet one final push, nodded with satisfaction as it flushed properly, then washed his hands thoroughly.

""Sir, there are thousands of alien warships approaching Earth!""

""Yeah, yeah, I heard the alarms."" Frank dried his hands on his coveralls. ""Let me finish my rounds first. The trash on level 4 still needs to be emptied.""

Yamamoto's mouth fell open. ""But... the aliens... they're going to be in attack position in less than three hours!""

Frank sighed. ""Son, I've been doing this job since before you were born. Trust me, the trash doesn't empty itself.""

After watching Frank methodically empty fifteen trash cans, mop two hallways, and replace a flickering light bulb (""Might as well, since I've got the ladder out""), Yamamoto was nearly hysterical.

Finally, Frank checked his ancient flip phone. ""Alright, I guess I can take an early lunch."" He shambled toward the utility closet at the end of the hall, pulled out a ring of at least fifty keys, and unlocked it.

Inside, past the mops, buckets, and industrial-sized bottles of cleaning solution, Frank pushed aside a poster of a cat hanging from a tree branch (""Hang in there, baby!"") to reveal a small keypad. He punched in a 28-digit code from memory, placed his eye against a scanner disguised as a knot in the wood, and whispered something that sounded suspiciously like ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.""

The back wall of the closet slid open.

Yamamoto gaped at the hidden room beyond. He'd expected high-tech weaponry, glowing control panels, perhaps a teleportation device. Instead, he saw what looked like a janitor's break room: a battered couch, a mini-fridge, a microwave, and a small table.

On the table sat a dented metal lunchbox covered in faded Thundercats stickers.

Frank picked it up lovingly. ""My wife gave me this, back in '88. She's been gone fifteen years now."" He patted the lunchbox. ""Cancer. But she always made the best tuna sandwiches.""

""Sir,"" Yamamoto said carefully, ""with all due respect... what does your lunchbox or your wife have to do with the alien invasion?""

Frank flipped open the lunchbox. Inside, nestled between an aging thermos and a Saran-wrapped sandwich, was a single red button.

""This,"" Frank said, tapping the button gently, ""is humanity's last line of defense.""

""What... what does it do?""

Frank shrugged. ""Nobody knows. Not even me. All I know is, forty-six years ago, my predecessor at Roswell unfortunately passed, and I was given this button and told to press it if aliens ever invaded. I've pressed it six times since then.""

""SIX times?"" Yamamoto squeaked. ""There have been six alien invasions?""

""That I know of."" Frank unwrapped his sandwich and took a bite. ""Mmmf... anyway, the button works. Don't ask me how. Last time, the Rillopian Swarm ships just turned around and left. Time before that, the Xenovores actually sent us an apology gift basket. Had some weird alien fruit in it. Tasted like blueberries mixed with gasoline.""

""So... you just press the button and the aliens... go away?""

Frank finished chewing and pointed at Yamamoto with his sandwich. ""Sometimes they go away. Sometimes they, well, don't. But they're never a problem again."" He glanced at his watch. ""Should probably do it now. My shows come on at three.""

Without ceremony, Frank pressed the red button.

Nothing happened. No flashing lights, no dramatic music, no earthquake. Just a small, anticlimactic 'click.'

Yamamoto waited. ""Is that... it?""

Frank closed his lunchbox. ""Yep. Now we wait."" He pulled a crossword puzzle from his pocket. ""You know an eight-letter word for 'celestial body'? Starts with 'A'?""

""Asteroid?""

""Thanks.""

**First Contact**

Supreme High Overlord Xix'Tharaxul was preparing his pre-annihilation speech when it happened. A strange tingling sensation began at the tip of his tail and rapidly spread throughout his massive reptilian form. Around him, the bridge crew began experiencing the same phenomenon.

""My Emperor!"" gasped Admiral Kraz'Thul. ""Something is happening to our bio-signatures! Some kind of... transformation!""

The Emperor tried to roar in defiance, but what came out instead was a high-pitched squeak. His twelve eyes widened in horror as he watched his fearsome claws retract into stubby, harmless digits. His armored scales softened into something disturbingly... cuddly.

Throughout the vast Draconian fleet, the same terrifying metamorphosis was underway. Fierce warriors known across galaxies for their brutality found themselves becoming... adorable.

On Earth, in the White House Situation Room, the President of the United States watched the rapidly changing alien fleet with mounting confusion.

""General Williams, what exactly am I looking at here?"" she demanded.

Williams, who had arrived just minutes earlier, sipped his coffee from his ""World's Okayest General"" mug. ""Looks like Frank pressed the button, Madam President.""

""The janitor? With the mysterious, old lunchbox?""

""Yes, ma'am.""

On the giant viewscreen, the massive alien warships were... changing. Their sharp, predatory lines were softening. Weapon ports were sealing up. The ominous red glow from their engines was shifting to a friendly blue.

""Our sensors indicate the alien fleet has lost all offensive capabilities,"" reported the NASA liaison. ""Their energy signatures are... well, there's no other way to describe it. They're turning cute.""

""Cute,"" repeated the President flatly.

""Yes, ma'am. And they're now broadcasting on all frequencies. They want to... um... 'be friends.'""

---

**The Domestication**

Two weeks later, Frank was mopping the floor of the entrance to the UN General Assembly when the motorcade arrived. Sleek black SUVs with diplomatic flags pulled up, and security personnel created a perimeter as the doors opened.

Out stepped Xix'Tharaxul, former Supreme High Overlord of the Draconian Imperium, now barely a meter tall with huge, expressive eyes, stubby limbs, and soft scales that shimmered in pastel colors. Behind him waddled his former admirals and generals, similarly transformed.

Humans lined the walkway, many holding signs that read ""WELCOME SPACE FRIENDS"" and ""WE ❤️ DRACONIANS.""

Frank nodded politely as the alien delegation passed. Xix'Tharaxul paused, his enormous eyes fixed on the janitor.

""You,"" the former tyrant squeaked in a voice that sounded like a kitten gargling helium. ""You're the one, aren't you? The one who pressed The Button.""

Frank leaned on his mop. ""Just doing my job.""

The alien blinked slowly. ""You've altered the fundamental biology of an entire species. You've transformed the most feared empire in the known universe into..."" he gestured at his diminutive, adorable form, ""...this.""

""Seems like an improvement to me,"" Frank observed. ""You were gonna blow up the planet.""

Xix'Tharaxul's tiny shoulders slumped. ""Do you have any idea what you've done to us? We can't help it—we now physically need human affection. We crave your approval. We've begun collecting stuffed animals and watching your 'Disney' films. It's... it's humiliating.""

""Could be worse,"" Frank said philosophically. ""You could be dead.""

Inside the General Assembly, the President of the United States addressed the gathered nations.

""Today marks a historic moment in human history. The Draconian delegation has signed the Treaty of Friendship and Adoption. Each Draconian will be paired with a human family who will provide them with the care, affection, and occasional belly rubs they now require to survive.""

In the back of the room, General Williams leaned toward his aide. ""Has anyone figured out what the hell that button actually does?""

""No, sir. Our best scientists are calling it 'The Cutification Field.' Apparently it rewrites alien DNA to make them... well, either completely non-hostile to humans or um, pets.""

""And Frank's had this thing since he was at Roswell?""

""Yes, sir. The working theory is that some benevolent alien species gave it to us as protection. Like giving a toddler a panic button.""

Williams considered this. ""So somewhere out there, some advanced civilization decided the best way to protect humanity was to let us turn hostile aliens into... puppies?""

""Essentially, yes.""

""Huh."" Williams took a swig from his flask. ""I guess they knew us pretty well.""

---

**The New Normal**

Six months later, the integration of the Draconians into human society was proceeding better than anyone could have expected. The former planet-destroyers had become beloved companions, their natural intelligence making them easy to train and their newfound desire to please humans making them eager students.

In suburban homes across the globe, scenes played out that would have been unthinkable just a year earlier:

In Tokyo, a businessman taught his assigned Draconian (formerly the commander of an elite death squad) to fetch his slippers.

In Rio de Janeiro, a family took holiday photos with their three Draconians dressed in matching Christmas sweaters.

In Mumbai, a young programmer had trained her Draconian (once the inventor of a weapon that could collapse stars) to bring her coffee while she coded.

TikTok and Instagram were flooded with ""cute Draconian"" videos. Viral sensations included a former planet-killer singing along to ""Baby Shark"" and the ex-Emperor himself doing something called the ""Draconian Dance Challenge.""

The global economy boomed with Draconian-related products: special beds, toys, grooming supplies, and fashion lines specifically designed for their unique physiology. Former warships had been converted into floating Draconian habitats and tourist attractions.

But perhaps the most significant change was in humanity itself. Global conflicts decreased dramatically as nations found themselves united in their new role as caretakers. Resources once dedicated to warfare were redirected to expansion, and with the advanced technology willingly shared by their new Draconian companions (in exchange for treats and affection), humanity began reaching for the stars.

**Epilogue: The Universe Takes Notice** 

In the depths of space, on a hidden observation platform, three beings of pure energy monitored the situation on Earth.

""The humans have used The Button again,"" noted the first being.

""The seventh time,"" confirmed the second. ""And once again, they've managed to not only survive but thrive.""

""Should we be concerned?"" asked the third. ""No other species has ever used The Button more than twice. We gave it to them as a last resort, not as a... a domestication tool.""

The first being pulsed with what might have been amusement. ""That's precisely why we chose humans to protect. They're... creative.""

On the viewscreen, they watched as Frank, now retired but still carrying his Thundercats lunchbox, sat on a park bench. Beside him, Xix'Tharaxul, wearing a tiny sweater that read ""Earth's #1 Former Galactic Tyrant,"" was contentedly eating an ice cream cone.

""The Vrypane Dominion is planning to invade next solar cycle,"" noted the second being. ""Their Hive Consciousness believes the Draconians were simply weak and without resolve.""

""Then they'll learn,"" said the first being, ""what every would-be conqueror eventually discovers about humans.""

""Which is?""

The first being's energy form flickered with what might have been a smile. ""That their true superpower isn't their technology or their weapons or even The Button.""

""Then what is it?""

""Their ability to make pets out of predators. To turn enemies into family. It's a kind of power the rest of the universe can't understand—and that's why they keep winning.""

On Earth, Frank scratched Xix'Tharaxul behind what approximated ears. The former tyrant of forty-seven galaxies closed his enormous eyes in bliss and made a sound suspiciously like purring.

""You're not so bad,"" Frank told him. ""For an alien who wanted to blow up the planet.""

Xix'Tharaxul licked his ice cream. ""And you're not so bad for a species that turned the most feared empire in the universe into... pets.""

Frank shrugged. ""That's humanity for you. We've been domesticating dangerous animals since wolves. You Draconians were just... bigger wolves.""

""With spaceships and death rays,"" added Xix'Tharaxul.

""Details,"" said Frank, checking his watch. ""My shows are coming on. Want to watch Wheel of Fortune reruns?""

As they walked home together, a shooting star crossed the sky—or perhaps it was another alien invasion fleet, coming to learn the hard way about humanity's unique, ironclad defenses.

Either way, Frank and his lunchbox were ready.

1j9jetg,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1j9jetg/i_think_i_realized_something_about_dating_that/,I think I realized something about dating that makes me feel better.,"I am drinking my coffee this morning and thinking. I have never really tried to persuade anyone to do anything. My mind seems to work on a different plane than a lot of people, so I gave up on being persuasive or changing someone's opinion a long time ago. 

But let's pretend it was my job to convert people to a specific religion. I would not go door to door of course. That is a tough sell. As an individual if it was my job to try and convert someone. What I would do is to lead a happy, secure, and comfortable life in my religion. 

I would not try to sell anything. I would not try to persuade anyone of anything. I would just be happy and content in my own life and religion. Then if they feel something missing in their lives, they could look to mine to see what my system has to offer and its appeal. Maybe then they will convert on their own.

Obliviously I am not trying to convert anyone. But it would be nice to have a girlfriend someday :)

It goes without saying that I am horrible salesman. Always have been. I could not sell anything. 

I am not going to try and sell myself to a potential dating partner. I never could do it. I am willing to bet I will never be able to. But that is totally fine :)

I will be super happy and content in my life no matter what. No one knows how to have fun like me. I hate to say I am the best- but perhaps I am. I am a relatively intelligent guy in his late 30s with autism. No relationship yet (not a huge surprise lol). 

But I will be dammed if I am not having more fun than the vast majority of people. People seem to complain about their lives, their jobs, the world around them all the time. I do not see the world that way. I think the world is a wonderful place with a near infinite about of possibilities for fun and happiness. 

My whole point being is I think I am just going to keep living my happy and content life just the way I am :)

I hope it appeals to people. I am very non-traditional of course. But people do not seem super happy in traditional roles. So, I am offering an alternative. A different way of living. A different path to happiness, fun and contentment. 

I know there are a lot of unhappy people out there. I hope at least one of them finds me and gets a little bit happier :)

I know who I am. I know what I offer. I do not need to sell it. ",4,1741784143.0,autism,1,0.83,False

Im 19, male. unmedicated, no coffee/energy drinks/anything. These past two months, I've been sleeping at 9pm, waking up at 2 am ish and eating/showering, then sleeping at 5am and waking  up at 2pm. 

No problem sleeping. Ever. I can take 5 naps back to back if I really wanted to. I can sleep in cars, movie theaters, after just waking up, in crowded rooms, etc. I can keep myself awake though, on my own, about 90% of the time, like for driving or my college courses. 

anyways, these past few days, a sudden 180° happened. I have no idea what caused it!! I cannot sleep! I got incredibly dizzy for three days, and it went away. Not too abnormal for me. Could have just been stress or dehydration.
Yesterday I got maybe 4 hours of sleep, max? but was able to function fine!! I just sat with my blackout eye mask for hours, not moving! I sleep in a dark room. no music. no noise. no stimuli. I genuinely dont even daydream. But I was definitely awake.

I got out of bed at around 10 ish and just. woke up? I was tired, I guess, but? the normal ""oh.. honey.. everyone is tired sometimess...."", not the narcoleptic tired? 

Im writing this at 5am. I haven't slept since. I've been up for officially 24 hours and I dont think this has ever happened before. Not for maybe 8 years, at max! is this a problem? did I break my brain?? I'm a total hypochondriac (and sometimes I'm right!! I knew i had sepsis even though everyone around me encouraged me not to go to the hospital, among other events.), so i don't want to overreact, and i just got my Medicaid taken, so a hospital or even doctors visit would be awful.

Headache started around 9 (I usually have a dose between 6:30 and 8). Found this sub when I was trying to find out how long withdrawals typically last for. 

My routine has become one huge cup in the morning, and often another in the afternoon, sometimes either adding an energy drink or replacing the afternoon cup with the energy drink. Substituting for caffeine pills when I am fasting. So that's like 500mg or something on ""peak"" days, which admittedly are uncommon. I didn't even drink coffee at all until 7-8 years ago. 

Don't really have any adverse affects that I'm aware of. Perhaps getting off it will reveal something. The hardest will probably be to give up the ritual. We junkies love our rituals. It will be difficult to combat the urge I sometimes get to increase my productivity -- that's usually when I reach for an energy drink. Though lately that hasn't really felt like it worked anyway. Honestly, I never really noticed a big difference on caffeine, only the withdrawals whenever I'd stop.

Gonna have to start by tapering off since I still need to be functional. I'm thinking 100mg pill once per day, just to keep the worst of it at bay until my dependence is a bit lower. I took 100mg an hour ago and the headache persists, though milder.

1j9jath,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j9jath/i_was_left_and_thrown_out_suddenly_after_8_happy/,I was left and thrown out suddenly after 8 happy years,"TLDR, I was left suddenly after 8 happy years without a reason or excuse and thrown out of our home after suffering severe psychosis.

I don't even know where to begin. He (37m) and I (36f) were a couple for 8 years, living together for 5. He and my son (16) always had a great relationship, and about a year ago, my boy started calling him ""dad"". We were both tee-total, there was never any cheating that I was aware of, and none of us ever got into any trouble with the law. He bought us a house on the street where I grew up, and we made a home and a family together. I told my now ex every day that he was a good man, because he really was, and I never had a bad word to say about him, other than wishing he would be a little more open emotionally. He told me, all the time, that I was ""his person"", the ""love of his life"", he'd call just to hear my voice and slept with his arm over me protectively every night. He'd do the kindest, most thoughtful things claiming he liked to just see us smile, and even when things were tough, we both always made the effort for each other. I really, genuinely believed we were forever. Because he told me that, right until the day he left me.

I was diagnosed with a chronic illness that affects my mobility a year into our relationship. I am very stubborn and never allowed him to look after me, unless I physically couldn't move. We both suffered with panic attacks, and migraines, and he'd had several surgeries on his back, so we just kind of got each other, and it was always easy and nice, without any agenda or pressure.

We tried, for 7 years, to have a baby, but only had recurrent miscarriages due to unexplained infertility. He asked, even sometimes expected, me to put my body through a lot to try to make it happen, and I did, but he never even had a blood test, or a sperm screening.

He proposed after 6 months, and got us a puppy after 1 year, and on the fifth anniversary of his proposal, after years of hearing him refer to me as his fiancé, I asked if we could set a date. We're both quiet, bookish introverts who hate social media and being in the spotlight, and I held his hand and explained that I didn't want a wedding, just a marriage, and to take his surname. And he rolled his eyes and declared he no longer felt that way, that it ""wasn't in the cards"", and he was content to live together. I occasionally tried to have a conversation about it, as I was very hurt, and made sure I spoke to him with maturity and respect, but he completely shut me out for 2 years. I stopped working, at his request, and essentially became a housewife. I gave him a lot of money towards the bills and his car (I've never learned to drive). I was starting to feel frustrated and fed up by his decision-making, so, about 4 months before the separation, I asked for a compromise. I simply requested he added me to the mortgage, as I was paying towards it, and again, he shut me down and said no. He made decisions about the house without consulting me, but always referred to it as ""ours"", and still took money towards anything new or anything that required fixing. A while ago I asked if he would put himself in my shoes, to imagine I'd done those selfish and hypocritical things to him, and simply asked how he would feel. He broke down, saying ""oh God I'd hate you. I'd hate you and I'd cut all contact"", then held him as he had a panic attack, but nothing changed in terms of his, I guess, rules. So I accepted his decisions, focusing instead on his kind and caring traits, and made sure I always put him and my son first, feeling the family and the relationship were secure and solid (as he always said as much) with or without those commitments.

He has childhood friends, a couple, who live in another country, and over the years I became the best of friends with the wife. We spoke most days despite the difference in time zones, and I told her about my frustrations regarding his choices, but never complained or spoke badly about him.

3 months ago, around the anniversary of the last miscarriage, he told me he's very depressed, and having testosterone issues, and although I asked if I was to blame, I entirely supported him, without pressure or criticism. I've suffered with depression over the years and know exactly how difficult it is to pull yourself out, so I promised to get myself as healthy as possible to be the best partner to him and parent to my son, and made sure he knew all the time with warmth and affection that he was so much more than his problems, that there was no time limit, and that I'd always be by his side as he had been for me. I was quickly offered one doctor's and hospital appointment after another to try to improve my health, and it was overwhelming and scary, but he insisted on attending every appointment with me, and, again, he insisted we were nothing but solid. We hadn't ""tried"" for months at that point, choosing to be as intimately normal as possible without using contraception, and it was quite nice to not find myself obsessing about tracking my ovulation and just being a couple again. We hadn't been even remotely intimate since he said he's depressed in December, as I didn't want him to feel pressured, and I was very happy when he booked a mini break for our upcoming anniversary for us to just talk about our future and reconnect without the focus being sex.

After a procedure on my back involving an epidural and various anaesthetics I was numb and weak for days, but found myself looking after him rather than the other way around. I didn't mind and never complained or made petty comments, as he often worked more than 50 hours a week, and was clearly depressed and burnt out, but, again, he called me all of the kind, loving names and said all of the sweet phrases, called my boy his stepson, and said every day, every single day, that we were forever and we'd get each other through anything.

He'd always been so kind and considerate, and I was very shocked and hurt when he said seemingly out of nowhere several days after the spine procedure that he misses the ""old me"", that I'd taken over his house, that I never support him, and despite being upset and reacting initially by withdrawing and being kind of petty (by removing any aspect of my personality from the house) I swallowed my pride and took a lot of steps to make him feel better by removing my clutter, looking after my hair and skin and nails, and throwing myself into being as supportive and considerate as possible, often asking what I could do to make his life a little easier.

A week after the procedure, when the numbness had worn off and I noticed a significant difference in my pain level, I told him, inarticulately and maybe at a bad moment, that something just didn't feel right in my mind, and he dismissed my concerns and told me to sleep it off. For a full week, when I was caring for him after he broke his toes, and for my son who was in the middle of his exams, I was having what I now know were severe physchosis delusions due to a reaction to the steroid in the spine procedure, and became paranoid and scared without any real reason, as well as hearing and seeing things that I genuinely believed to be true. But, I didn't hear voices or imagine conversations. I made an emergency doctor's appointment but cancelled it soon after, absolutely convinced that speaking to a doctor would have a domino effect that would lead to me being sectioned and him losing his job, so I kept my increasing paranoia and irritational fears to myself, cleaning obsessively and ritualistically and barely sleeping or eating, and not speaking to anyone outside of the house. I never accused him of cheating, I didn't think he or anyone else would hurt me, but the words, he misses the ""old me"" replayed in my head constantly on a loop, and with no context of his words became fixed to the idea that he meant my weight, so I deliberately didn't have more than coffee and a few bites of lean chicken every day. I'm still not completely out of that mindset, and have made myself ill from near starvation.

I sat with him holding his hand when he spoke to the doctor. He told me he was getting help for his depression, then refused to speak to the doctor again or have the required blood test that had been appointed. He was kind and sweet and funny again, making lots of plans for several months ahead, including swapping shifts (without being asked) to attend my son's school events. I asked if he might be spreading himself too thinly, and he insisted he was happy and it was what he needed. 2 weeks before his birthday and 3 weeks before our 8th anniversary, he messaged and called ""just to hear my voice"", excitedly told me about surprises he'd bought for ""his boy"", sent me pictures of the B&B he'd just booked for the two of us and the dog, and bought lots of food (specifically meat despite him being a vegetarian) for ""family dinners"". I know it wasn't in my head that things were totally normal and good, as there were texts and calls, and pictures and videos, to prove it, and he was still affectionate. He often gave us thoughtful little gifts, and I told him I appreciated it, but didn't want or need anything other than him, and that I felt bad that I couldn't afford to do the same in return. I tried to tell him again that something was wrong in my mind, this time crying inconsolably while relaying a positive call I'd had from a nurse while he was on night shifts, and again he dismissed my concerns so much that I became oddly upset and asked for some space (as in, to think and have a nap).

He brought me a coffee and little gifts in bed in the morning, said all the kind and loving words and suggested decorating ideas, messaged and called from work ""to hear my voice"", and when he got back from work that same evening he walked by me and my son without any acknowledgement and closed himself in our bedroom with the dog. He'd never done that before, so I went to check on him and to ask about his day.

And he left me.

Exactly like that, no warning or attempt at a discussion. We were over.

I was upset and angry, but didn't grovel or beg or ask him to reconsider, only to give me a reason, and all he said, without any affection or eye contact, was ""he loves me but he's realised he wants kids"", followed by nothing other than, ""sorry"". My son heard and was so overwhelmed and confused that he packed his essentials and left to stay with his father, and all the man who had called himself my boy's stepdad for years said was, ""bye"". I've never been away from my son for more than a few days, we have an incredible bond and regularly have mother and son time together, and I could not deal with the emotion around him leaving. I have very little memory after the point my son left, but simply remember the crushing fear, humiliation, the uncertainty, the hyperventilating crying; I was still extremely paranoid and was obsessing about ridiculous details and had 1000 questions knowing I'd never receive any answers. I wasn't even told where I was expected to sleep that night, I was just left alone downstairs to deal with the fallout of the inexplicable actions of the man I'd devoted 8 years of my life to, with nothing to show for it. I took some painkillers for the oncoming migraine, and the next thing I remember I was in the hospital unable to breathe from the awful charcoal-induced vomiting. I was still in a state of psychosis for almost 2 days before I became lucid, with my dad sat beside me holding my hand, but my now ex did not visit, and only messaged to tell me to not contact him again. I found out later he'd angrily called my son before he called an ambulance, and told him sarcastically that he was ""very mature"" when my boy became hysterical. 

It's now 2 weeks after he left me, and when my son went to stay with his father. I've stuck to the no-contact arrangement, and am registered as homeless while I'm staying on my sibling's sofa. I've had extensive counselling and meetings with the mental health crisis team and have been told over and over that the psychosis was caused medically, and the suicide attempt that I have no memory of was the catalyst in an extreme emotional state, as well as that I'd tried to protect my little family by keeping my erratic thoughts and behaviour to myself, but I feel so confused and ashamed. If I'd been in control of my mind I would never have done that, never traumatised my now ex or risked losing custody of my child for any reason.
I had no savings, no money at all until the following week, after using every penny I earned/received on raising my son and paying my now ex towards the bills and mortgage that he refused to add my name to. I had no proof that I'd bought/paid towards any furniture and electrical items, and when I learned I had legal rights, I couldn't justify being vindictive in any way. I transferred him £40 without thinking, and was not offered or given it back. My now ex dumped all, and I do mean all, of my son's and my belongings at various family member's houses, and has not offered for me to even see our dog who was with me almost constantly for 7 years.
I am homeless, penniless, I have lost everything I believed about my life and about myself, and still have no idea why he blindsided me without even a conversation about the way he was feeling.
I still have legal custody, but I'm only seeing my son once a week now as his father lives miles away from my sibling and I have no money for bus fare.
I have no ideation or thoughts of SH in any way, but I feel utterly devastated and lost, as well as afraid of my own mind. I miss my boy, and my dog, and wonder constantly how this kind man could do something so cruel to all of us. I find myself swaying between feeling numb and crying for hours. And I miss him.
I've talked every day with my best friend, the wife of my ex's best friend, who lives in another country, and despite knowing him for over 20 years they are just as confused as I am about the relationship ending, particularly so suddenly without even a chance of having a difficult conversation, but they've said he's not had one nice word to say about me, claiming he was my caretaker instead of partner and was tired of my obsession to become pregnant again. My best friend told me he had every intention of reconciliation if I hadn't attempted suicide, but didn't believe my friend about the steroid-induced psychosis that caused that action.

I know I made mistakes, I know I wasn't always receptive or considerate of his feelings, I have mobility issues and sleep often, and I definitely could/should have been a little more mature sometimes, but if you'd asked me just over 2 weeks ago if I thought he would ever behave so selfishly and cruelly, I'd have laughed. I'm left wondering now what happened, to me, to him, to us, to turn the man I would have done anything for into a grotesque mockery of my kind, gentle, funny partner and best friend.

I'm sticking to the no-contact rule, even if that means I don't see the dog, and have no intention of going back to him if he asks me to, as he's completely obliterated my son's and my lives for no reason or even excuse, and that is unforgivable.
And for some reason that I will never understand, regardless of what now feels like complete lies and cowardice and utter selfishness on his part, I still love him, so much, and keep wondering if he's eating and sleeping enough and driving to work safely.

And other than losing my boy, that is what hurts the most.",1,1741783778.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

\- Any tips for an 10 and 8 year old? I'm assuming it's best to do pool/slides first thing in the AM when they aren't as busy and then Kids Club in the afternoon? Also, will they be together in the same age group in the Kids Club?

I had a bit of an off week last week; couple of dinners out, few drinks. Usual life stuff. Maintained rather than lost, but I was keen to get back to it this week.

I travel for work every Monday and Tuesday, and they're always low kcal days for me just cos it's so busy, and there are zero healthy options easily available, but this week I was very overly mindful. I worked out when away, felt good, and my weigh in this morning showed a normal loss.

All good then? Well no. This morning I felt like death; no energy, couldn't complete my workout etc. I couldn't figure out what was going on, then my wife asked what I'd eaten and it dawned on me that all day yesterday, I consumed lots of water and coffee but food wise, I only ate half a poke bowl (it was rank). No more than 500kcals and 10g of protein. 

Turns out food is indeed fuel. A timely reminder from my own body that I need to eat, and eat well, to feel good.

I do most of the chores in the house like dishes, trash, laundry, cleaning and sweeping stuff like that(for the record me and my sister swap who does the dishes each time we do them). My mom's constantly calling me like every roughly 30 minutes to either get her coffee, or warm her up something in the microwave. They don't really make my sister do anything other then the dishes, and call me instead. Like when my mom wants the medicine for the next day out. But they always talk about how I suck at driving yet I never have time to practice (and don't want to with my little siblings in the car) when they never give me time to. Always talking about my high 60 and low 70 in my classes despite trying my damnedest. Their always threatening me to take my like electronics away if I don't bring them up, despite how I bought them and put a lot of money into them myself. I just don't know how to feel in the end.

* Spiritual drift does not require rebellion—just a little space where we allow doubt, fear, or sin to settle.
* Drifting is dangerous because it happens quietly. But God’s grace is always there, ready to pull us back.
* God’s grace doesn’t just rescue us; it holds us in place, keeping us aligned with Him even in our weakest moments.
* God’s grace doesn’t just forgive—it empowers. It tells us: **Stand up. Keep walking. I am holding you.**
* Grace is not just a safety net—it is our anchor. When we trust in it, we are held firm, no matter how hard the storms of life try to pull us away.
* A fall is only final if you refuse to get up.
* When we fall, we think God is disappointed, ready to condemn us. But the truth is: He reaches for us.
* Many people stay down because they think they must stand on their **own strength.** But grace is not about self-effort—it’s about **God holding us up.**
* You don’t have to be strong enough—God’s grace is your strength.
* When you stand after a fall, you don’t just regain strength—you gain a testimony
* Your fall does not define you—**your decision to stand does.**
* The drift is slow, not sudden. No one wakes up one morning and decides, ""Today, I will walk away from God."" Instead, spiritual drift happens through small choices.",1,1741782850.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

Reason that I wanted to meet new people para naman di ako lagi nakatanga sakanya dahil before sinabihan nya ko ng ""wala ka bang kaibigan?"" When im asking him bakit di sya nag uupdate. Oo nag bago naman na sya, nag uupdate na sya now pero gusto ko parin ng new friends since busy lahat ng friends ko and since may pinag dadaanan ako sa bf ko and I need to go out and to shift my mind.

Here's the issue with my bf, the bare minimum guy, ilang araw, ilang buwan na ko na may dilemma talaga sa relationship namin kung itutuloy ko pa. 

And bago sya makipag break sakin inask nya sakin ano ba daw problema ko bakit ko ba kailangan makipag meet ng new people.

Sabi ko ""last time, Valentines and Birthday ko you promised na may bibigay ka sakin na something useful, okay naman na di natuloy yun kasi may flowers naman sa valentines, binigyan mo ko ng roses tho knowing na sunflower gusto ko pero sobrang appreciate ko parin and sa birthday ko ganun rin nag promise ka may bibigay ka pero di nangyare, tho happy naman ako may tig 150php ako na flowers galing sa grocery store, appreciate ko yun e. Pero yung inaya mo ko ng sex knowing na we already talked about yung 3 mos na abstinence muna? I feel disrespected e""

He's still angry at me blaming me na I'm no difference daw than my exes. Microcheating daw ako. Like as if nakipag meet ako romantically? He even disregard my concern about na nadisrespect ako.  

Yung context ng 3 mos abstinence na yun bakit ko ginawa yung yon because I'm feeling na TRANSACTIONAL lahat ng efforts nya. Mag bibigay sya ng something then before kami umuwi mag aask sya ng ""Do you want to have some fun? (sex)""

Lagi yon, namimilit pa sya mga 2-3x nya tinatanong sakin. Dati pinag bibigyan ko. Kasi di ko naman keri pa mag ambag pa that time ng kahit ano sa lakad namin kaya sige payag ako sa sex kahit uneasy ako.

Tapos after months, natuto nako mag No. Tho di naman sya nag tatampo right after ko mag no pero may naging away kami about it.

He told me na kaya ba daw ako ayaw makipag sex e di pako nakakamove on sa ex ko? (Active kasi kami ng ex ko before, while sya NGSB, di marunong mag satisfy ng babae pa, kaso hirap rin talaga ko magturo sakanya sa bed nasasaktan ako, kaya nag no-no nalang talaga ko pag wala ko sa mood)

Pero di naman yun ang reason talaga bakit ako natuto mag NO sakanya, feeling ko kasi napaka transactional ever since ng actions nya. 

Dati after ng sex di manlang nya ko automatically aantayin muna makauwi. Carousel bus lang mabilis naman yon, ayaw nya pa. Ako pa nag turo sakanya na he should wait for me kasi lalake sya he needs to make sure I'm safe kasi he's stronger. NGSB sya kaya pinalipas ko nalang.

Maraming cases na pinalampas ko mga bare minimum actions nya, pero mostly talaga nafefeel ko na lahat ng actions nya is for sex lang. Oo di naman sya nag tatampo on the spot pero I feel uneasy... Na sana every ONE or ISANG no ko lang pinapakinggan na nya, kaso ilang beses pa.

Itong huli, isang No lang naman nangyare but the thing na we already agreed nga na WALA muna for 3 mos, dun talaga ko feel disrespected, ano pag kakaiba non sa isang No at pagsasabi ko ahead na wala nga muna? It's the same. Nag sabi na ko, ENOUGH na yon.

Now sya nakipag break, di ko alam ano actually mafefeel na ako pa sinisisi nya.",1,1741782825.0,MayConfessionAko,2,1.0,False

My problem is that when there is literally 0 noise it drives me insane, and at the same time, my boss will almost on a daily basis, buy a back of chips, get a cup of coffee, then i have to listen to him digging in what seems like a **never ending bag of chips**, crunching every chip with what seems like excessive time, and slurping coffee and you can hear him breathing while eating the chips too..... 

i get so distracted by these things on a daily basis, and i might add, having people constantly walk through our office, many of whom walk like mouse and practically jump scare you when they walk by, or the people that walk by real slow and eavesdrop on what your doing on your PC, that triggers my anxiety also.

Whether you’re a solopreneur hustling from your kitchen table, a marketer chasing that next breakthrough, or someone just Googling “how to make my website not suck” – **welcome home**.

This isn’t another “get rich quick” circus. Here, we’re about **real growth**: the kind that’s built on smart strategies, hard-won lessons, and community wisdom.

**What to expect**:  
✅ **No-BS guides** (think “How to turn your website into a traffic magnet” or “Why your landing page is ghosting visitors”).  
✅ **Case studies** from people who’ve been in your shoes – like the coffee shop owner who 10Xed sales with a $0 marketing budget.  
✅ A **judgment-free zone** to ask “dumb” questions, celebrate wins, or vent about Google’s latest algorithm tantrum.

**Your first mission** (if you choose to accept it):  
👉 **Drop a comment** with ONE goal you’re chasing right now.  
*Examples*:

* “Get my first 100 website visitors.”
* “Stop crying when I look at my bounce rate.”
* “Make my site look less 2003-Geocities.”

**Why I started this**:  
A decade ago, I built my first website. It was so ugly, my mom lied and said it “looked… unique.” But step by step, failure by failure, I learned. **This community is the mentor I wish I had** – let’s grow smarter, together.

P.S. If you’re shy, lurk awhile! But trust me: magic happens when you hit “post.”

I'm used to medium dark and dark roasts so I tried my hand with this.
Any tips as to what can I do to make it taste a bit better are welcome.

Advice needed.","I’m new to this and maybe I missed something, but honestly I don't understand the negativity that surrounds asking honest questions, especially around my sisters and brothers!

I asked a Trans person (I could tell, Trans to Trans) what their “dead” name was. Suddenly, the lukewarm cup of McCafé they’d been sipping, with cream and sugar, got thrown into my face. It ruined my hair piece, my carefully applied makeup, and kind of the rest of the day. 

Then they said something really rude to me about not being able to respect personal boundaries and walked off in a huff.

I don’t know where their anger came from (possibly her, or him, but kind of dykey and androgynous in that “I’m 19” kind of way, so either/or). I came to this tight circle of a community in hope maybe you lovely ladies can help?

I complimented them on their outfit and then asked them what their name used to be, because I feel “dead” names are still a part of our history as individuals. 

Now I feel like asking this question is going to get taken the wrong way, probably often. (I had to soak my wig in baby shampoo for an hour.). But I don’t quite understand what the problem is!

Understanding is one of the highest forms of love and you can't truly love someone without knowing their journey. That includes knowing the path they’ve already traveled.

I feel like the Trans person who emptied their coffee and backwash onto my head was overreacting and kind of a bitchy dick about it.

Was I wrong? Or were they? Should I press charges for assault with a coffee?",9,1741781519.0,transgendercirclejerk,8,1.0,False
1j9ilif,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1j9ilif/negative_miserable_people/,Negative miserable people,"Boyfriend’s mom hasn’t done anything particularly bad, no outright spite or nastiness. But she is just a negative person, and they are a negative family. Always complaining about something, someone’s health issues, some work issue. Not once in 5 years has his mom or sister asked me a question about myself, my family (I’m from the UK), my culture (it’s very different despite our shared language), it’s like they don’t give a fuck who I am. If I try to make any conversation I get shut down and corrected. His mom was a school teacher and she talks to both of us as if we are kids (39F, 42M) nothing we say is right, we get corrected about everything, conversations are not flowing conversations, we just get corrected. She has a passive superiority complex which clearly comes from insecurity. The family has a raft of health problems, which are talked about CONSTANTLY, there is no joy or positivity at all. My half British half Italian family are lively and entertaining, funny and optimistic. I hate being in their company, I feel low and depressed after time with them. 

There’s also the fact that she kept entering his house as and when she wanted but he shut that down as soon as I asked him to. To be fair he has always put us first, he is not the issue here.

I just feel like there is a melancholy in that family. And I can’t live with it, I want to marry my BF and have a family but NOT in the energy that they live in. I wouldn’t want my kids alone with her as I feel she would put her toxic negativity on them too, because she does it to him. She only calls him when she needs to complain about something or needs something fixed, in 5 years she never came over for a coffee or met him at a cafe to just ‘chat’ and be friendly. I saw someone refer to a ‘sonsband’ and that’s what he appears to be, a person to do things for her that a husband would do, she doesn’t seem to care at all about who he is as a person or what he thinks or feels or enjoys.

The whole family seems to lack emotions, joy and positivity in particular. He can also be quite negative but as a couple we have worked around that and he is much better now. He sees their energy and he recognises it, he puts us first as a couple.

I was always close to my boyfriend’s moms, and had sweet and loving relationships with them. Now that I’ve found the one I want to raise a family with I really dislike his mom and it hurts. But I tried for years and grew so exasperated with the constant negativity and lack of respect or just basic interest in me that I blocked her. Things have been so much better for me since, like a weight was lifted.

I don’t know what to do, when I think of them I feel instantly heavy and melancholic and I just don’t want that energy in my life.

I feel like a bitch for the blocking, but I was a people pleaser for a long time, and I finally learnt this last year to protect myself and my good energy. 

Things will only get worse as they get older, health issues etc, it feels like a black hole of inevitability. And the health issues are due to being overweight, so forgive me if I seem unsympathetic, but these issues were preventable. Don’t drink a 2L bottle of Sprite and then bitch about your diabetes issues. Don’t eat cookies all day and complain about dental health. Also - if you’re going to whine constantly about your own shit, how about occasionally asking someone else how they are feeling/doing…. Or must it always be about you??

They live their lives as victims. We don’t have that culture in the UK, not really. I have zero tolerance for it.
