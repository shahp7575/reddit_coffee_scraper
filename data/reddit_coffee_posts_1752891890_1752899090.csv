I learned that at five when Mom died, and again at twelve when Lisa, my step-mother moved in with her perfect daughter Chloe.","Life wasn't a fairytale. I learned that at five when Mom died, and again at twelve when Lisa, my step-mother moved in with her perfect daughter Chloe. At first, Lisa was kind to me, but soon she began showing her true, darker side. Chloe and I were the same age, but Lisa made sure that Chloe received all the attention from both her and my dad.

After a few months, I noticed how Dad started to ignore me as he got caught up in his ""perfect"" new family. Over time, I became just an extra, unwanted family member that no one cared about.

My only happy place was with my maternal grandparents, who lived in Italy. We made sure to visit each other whenever we could. Besides my grandparents, I loved only two other people in the world as much as my family—my childhood best friends, Jessica Martin and Adrian Parker. The three of us were inseparable until Adrian moved to a boarding school in London.

Jessica and I stayed close and kept in touch with Adrian every weekend. However, as soon as I started high school, Jessica began to ignore me, preferring to hang out with Chloe instead. Soon, they became best friends, and even Adrian stopped replying to my messages and calls.

As time passed, everyone around me seemed to compare me to Chloe or other girls. Lisa constantly insulted my looks and clothes and made sure others treated me the same way. Even my dad started to see me as a disgrace.

As little girls, we're often told stories of distressed damsels who need saving. But as I grew older, I realized I didn't need a Prince Charming to save me.

The only person capable of saving me was myself. I needed to become a strong, independent woman and stand up for myself.

I was clear about my future and goals by the time I finished high school. I worked hard to get into a top university, and my efforts paid off.

Five years later, Harvard's diploma gleamed on my wall. I'd traded starvation for strength, tears for titanium resolve. Even my reflection shocked me—waist-length hair, curves Ester swore made men trip, and eyes that no longer flinched.

Tomorrow, I'll be leaving Boston and returning to NYC after almost five years. During this time, neither my family nor Jessica or Adrian tried to contact me. My grandfather offered financial support, but I barely touched it.

As I packed my belongings and prepared for the airport, I tied my hair into a ponytail and examined my reflection in the mirror. My brown hair now cascaded down to my waist; I used to prefer short hair until high school. My round face was almost bare, with minimal makeup. My glasses were gone, and my hazel eyes, framed by thick lashes, were perfectly coated with mascara.

After taking one last look in the mirror, I grabbed my belongings and called a cab. Soon, I was on my way to the airport, hoping that everything would go well.

Little did I know, this journey back to NYC was going to turn my life upside down.

Chapter 2

It's been a week since I arrived in NYC. As soon as I landed in my birthplace, I got busy unpacking and setting up my home. This house was bought by my mother before she died. She wanted to keep it as a home, yet now, no family member is here with me today.

My family knew about my arrival, but no one had tried to meet me or contact me.

I brushed off those thoughts and continued sipping my coffee while sitting in the living room when I heard my phone ring.

I quickly stood up and grabbed the phone lying on the desk. A smile formed on my li-ps when I saw the name on the screen, and I answered the call.

""Hello, Grandpa! How are you? How is Grandma doing?""

""We're both fine, dear. How are you? Have you settled into your new home?"" he asked excitedly.

""Yes, Grandpa, I've settled in. I just wish you both were here with me,"" I replied, a bit sadly, making my grandpa chuckle.

""We'll be coming to visit you in a days, sweetheart. It's time I finally hand over the company to you,"" Grandpa said in a serious tone.

""Yes, Grandpa, I remember that. I just hope I can handle the responsibilities well.""

""You'll do great, my dear. You're perfect for leading the company,"" Grandpa assured me.

My grandpa, Stephen D'Amario never trusted my father—not after Mom died, and certainly not after he let Lisa and Chloe destroy what was left of our family. D’Amario Enterprises was Grandpa’s life’s work, meant for Mom, then for me. But after her cancer diagnosis, Dad took over, and Lisa made sure I’d never be fit to inherit it.

""You’re not university material,"" Dad sneered when I applied to colleges, parroting Lisa’s words. Yet I kept my grades up, clinging to one truth: the company would be mine at twenty-one.

The memories still clawed at me.

FLASHBACK

Jessica and Chloe barged into my room, their laughter sharp as knives. ""Ugly bit-ch,"" Jessica spat.

A book slammed into my face. Blood bloomed on my face. Then fists, nails, spit—each blow driving home my worthlessness. They destroyed my homework last, shredding it with glee.

""Know your place,"" Chloe hissed before slamming the door.

Alone, I sobbed, then rewrote the assignment until dawn. Weak. Pathetic.

FLASHBACK ENDS

I exhaled, flexing my hands—no longer trembling. At Harvard, I’d traded fear for fists. I even learned basic self-defence there.

Seeing how strong and decisive I am today gives me the confidence to take on the responsibility of being the heiress of D'Amario Enterprises.

Chapter 3

Adrian P.O.V

I've always gotten everything I wanted in life—from money to power, I had the finest of it all.

At 25, I'm one of the most successful businessmen in the country. Two years ago, my dad entrusted me with the full responsibility of the company, and today, it's one of the leading corporations in the USA. But the best part of my life is the love of my life, Jessica Martin. She's everything a man could ever ask for.

I've known Jessica since we were about 5 years old, but at 12, I moved to a boarding school in London. Despite the distance, Jessica and I always stayed in contact, and she supported me through every up and down.

During vacations, we always made sure to spend time together. I even remember Sarah, who used to be a good friend of ours. But after I moved to London, she started ignoring Jessica and even asked her to stay away from me. Jessica always told me how Sarah bullied her in high school.

As time went on, Jessica only grew more beautiful, both inside and out. Two years ago, after I took over the company, I asked her to be my girlfriend. With her, my life felt complete—she was not only pretty but also incredibly intelligent and talented. She was one of the top students in school and even got a scholarship to Harvard, but she chose to follow her pass-ion for modeling. Today, she's one of the highest-paid models in the industry.

My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on my office door. Without looking up, I told the person to come in.

I heard the click of heels on the floor and caught the familiar scent of perfume. Jessica walked towards me and sat on my desk.

""Good afternoon, love,"" I said, moving closer and taking her hands in mine.

""Hey, babe,"" she replied seductively, placing her other hand on my che-st.

""How was your day?"" I asked. She started telling me about her photoshoot that morning while I admired the beauty sitting before me. She looked amazing in that fitted white dress, her blond mid-length hair perfectly styled and falling onto her shoulders. As a model, she had a flawlessly toned body. She was perfect, and I was the luckiest man to have her in my life.

""Adrian, what are you wearing to your parents' wedding anniversary?""

""I want our outfits to coordinate since that's when you'll tell your parents about us,"" she said as she adjusted my tie.

""Well, you don't need to worry about that, love. My secretary has taken care of our outfits. You'll get the dress by tomorrow,"" I replied.

""Aww, thank you so much,"" she said happily. ""Now, if you're done with work, can we go home?""

""Sure, babe. Let me just call my secretary,"" I said, moving toward the phone to inform Josh of my departure.

I put on my coat, took Jessica's hand, and we interlocked our fingers as we walked toward the elevator.

I headed to my black Bugatti Veyron, opening the door for Jessica before jogging to the driver's seat. After starting the car, I soon stopped at a lavish Italian restaurant for dinner.

We chose a seat in the corner of the restaurant, and started discussing our future plans.

""Do you think your parents will accept our relationship?"" Jessica asked while sipping her wine.

""I don't think your mother is fond of me,"" she added as I narrowed my eyes.

""Why do you feel that way, Jess?""

""Ever since you came back from London, I've tried to talk to her, but she always ends up bringing up Sarah in the conversation.""

""She keeps telling me how sweet and kind Sarah is and how the three of us should hang out together like old times,"" Jessica said in a sad tone.

My jaw clenched at the mention of Sarah's name. What she did to Jessica was enough for me to hate her for the rest of my life.

""Sarah doesn't deserve to be our friend after what she did to you when I was gone. My mom doesn't know how ug-ly her true face is. Once she finds out, she'll stop talking about her,"" I replied angrily.

Even remembering how Sarah treated Jessica made my blood boil. Because of her, Jessica had to endure so many difficulties and traumas.

""Relax, babe. She's gone now. We don't have to worry about her,"" Jessica assured me, caressing my hand.

I smiled at her as the waiter brought our dinner. We ate while discussing the arrangements for my parents' anniversary party. Once we were done, I paid the bill, and we drove back to my penthouse.

I moved out of my parent's house two years ago and bought my place. After Jessica and I started dating, I asked her to move in with me. She's partially moved in, but she hasn't fully moved in yet.

As soon as we stepped into the penthouse, I slammed my li-ps against Jessica's. I grabbed her hair, causing her to tilt her head back, and I started kissing her neck hungrily, making her moan loudly.

Soon, we ended up on the couch. By this time, I had successfully removed her dress. She lay beneath me in her black lingerie, looking at me seductively as she started unbuttoning my shirt. Once she removed my shirt, followed by my pants, she took my member in her hand and began stroking it.

The room filled with our loud moans.

We ended up going for a second round and then showered together. Afterwards, we were so exhausted that we went straight to bed. I hugged her tightly in my arms, and soon, we both fell asleep.

Chapter 4

Adrian P.O.V

The past few days have been chaotic, as my parents' wedding anniversary is approaching. I've been busy with the arrangements for the party. It's also the day I plan to officially tell my parents about Jessica and my intention to marry her by the end of the year.

I even bought a ring for Jessica. If everything goes well, I'll propose to her at the party in front of everyone.

I looked up when I heard a knock on my office door and saw my father, James Parker, walking in with a serious expression.

""How are you, son? We hardly see you these days. Your mom misses you a lot,"" he said, sitting on the couch.

""I've just been caught up with work, Dad. I'll definitely visit Mom today,"" I replied while scanning some important files.

""I need to discuss something important with you. It's about the company."" I put my file down and turned to face him, waiting for him to continue.

""Since you've taken over the company, your mother and I think it's time for you to settle down. You'll be turning 26 this year, and we believe it's time for you to get married.""

Hearing this, I thought it was the perfect moment to tell him about Jessica, but before I could, he continued.

""We've decided you should marry the granddaughter of Stephen D'Amario. She's the heiress of the D'Amario family. Mr D'Amario was a close friend of your grandfather, so it would be a perfect match,"" my father revealed with a big smile.

I was in complete shock. I couldn't imagine marrying anyone other than Jessica.

""No, Dad, I don't want to marry anyone else. I've already decided what I want in life, and marrying some heiress isn't part of it,"" I said angrily.

""In that case, the company will be transferred to Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter. Your grandfather and Mr. D'Amario signed an agreement that you and his granddaughter must marry, allowing the Parker and D'Amario companies to merge for mutual benefit,"" he said calmly.

""I'm still not marrying her. To he-ll with this danm agreement!"" I snapped angrily.

""Oh, son, you must marry her. If you refuse, 40% of Parker Enterprises will go to her. If she refuses, 40% of D'Amario Enterprises will come to us. If you both refuse, 50% of each company's shares will go to charity,"" he explained.

I heaved a big sigh, annoyed and worried about how to explain this to Jessica. Every plan I made for us seemed to be crumbling.

""I'll leave now; your mother is probably waiting for me,"" he said, walking out of my office.

As I pondered this new problem, my phone rang. It was Jessica. I answered, and her sweet voice came through the line.

""Hey, babe! Are you still at the office? Did you forget about our date night at my place?"" she asked.

I had completely forgotten about the date night due to my busy schedule, but I quickly covered my negligence.

""Of course, love. I can't wait to see you,"" I said, smirking at the thought of holding her in my arms tonight.

""Alright, see you at 7 then. Bye, love you,"" she said.

""Love you too, babe."" I hung up and went back to thinking about how to handle this marriage situation. How would Jessica react?

I immediately called my best friend, Noah. He's the COO of Parker Enterprises. We met in boarding school, and we've been best friends ever since.

I picked up the intercom and called my secretary. ""Could you please ask Mr. Andrews to come to my office immediately?""

Within 10 minutes, Noah walked in. ""Hey, everything good?"" he asked as he sat down across from me.

""My father wants me to marry Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter, or else the company goes to charity.""

""What?! No way. We've worked so hard for the company these past two years. It would all be wasted if it goes to charity,"" Noah exclaimed. ""What about Jessica? Did you tell her?""

""Not yet, bro. I'm planning to tell her tonight,"" I replied, massaging my temples.

""Isn't D'Amario Enterprises owned by Neil Darrell?"" Noah asked.

I immediately realized he was right. ""If Neil Darrell is running D'Amario Enterprises, then the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry is Chloe Darrell,"" I said, connecting the dots.

""Exactly. You can talk to Jessica about this. She can easily convince Chloe to refuse the proposal since they're best friends,"" Noah suggested.

""That's what I was thinking. I need to get to Jessica's place now."" I quickly left the office and headed to Jessica's apartment.

I arrived and rang the bell. Within seconds, she opened the door. A smile formed on my face as I saw her. She wrapped her arms around my shoulders and kissed me. I kissed her back passionately. Soon, we were undressed and made our way to the bedroom. After hours of being together, we finally went downstairs for dinner.

I or-dered sushi since Jessica can barely cook. To be honest, she's a terrible cook—she can hardly boil water—but she's perfect in every other way, and she's all I want.

We finished dinner, talking about our day when I suddenly remembered the conversation with my dad.

""Babe, I need to tell you something important,"" I said, holding her hands close to my che-st.

I explained the entire situation, from the marriage proposal to the merger, and the consequences if we backed out.

Before I could tell her about Chloe, she snapped at me angrily, ""So you want to leave me and marry some random brat now?""

""No, babe, the only person I want to marry is you. I can't even think of marrying someone else,"" I reassured her.

""And this marriage won't happen. All you need to do is convince Chloe to refuse the proposal.""

""Chloe? What does she have to do with this proposal?"" she asked.

""She's the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry, and since she's your best friend, you can easily convince her to refuse,"" I explained.

A smile formed on her li-ps, and she hugged me tightly.

""That can be done easily. She's dating Justin now, so I doubt she'd ever want to marry you,"" she said happily.

""And I'll never marry or love anyone but you,"" I told her, pressing my kiss to her forehead.

Chapter 5

Sarah P.O.V

I felt tense and doomed after hearing what Grandpa and Grandma told me. They arrived in the States last night, and today they've given me the biggest shock of my life.

According to them, I must marry for the merger or lose a 40% share of Amario Enterprises. Before they could finish their next sentence, I slammed my hands on my lap and stood up.

""I can't accept this proposal, Grandpa. I just graduated, and right now, I want to explore new things. I don't want to get married so soon.""

""Sweetheart, we're not forcing you, but we want someone strong to take care of you. Grandpa and I are getting old, dear; we won't always be here to support you. That's why we want you to be secure and happy,"" Grandma said, making me sit down again as she held my hands.

I thought about everything happening. When it comes to marriage, love, respect, and trust are the pillars of happiness.

I've always been nervous about relationships, scared of rejection and being unloved.

I feared I'd be the one trying to maintain the relationship while the other person didn't care.

""Sarah, we always want what's best for you. But remember, if you reject this proposal, the company will be ruined. This company was your mother's dream. Sophia worked hard to bring it to where it is today. But honey, we don't want to force you,"" Grandpa said, comforting me.

Thinking about my mother, I wondered what she would do in my place. Would she accept this to save the company? She worked tirelessly until her illness confined her to bed.

""Grandpa, I need to think this over. I'll let you know my decision soon,"" I said with a weak smile and left.

I went to my room and closed the door. I lay on my bed, replaying the conversation with Grandpa and Grandma.

I never thought I'd get married so soon, let alone just for the sake of the company. But deep down, I knew this company held my mother's memories, her hard work, and her dream of making Amario Enterprises one of the leading companies in the world.

I always thought that when I married, it would be for love, not a business arrangement.

I never had time to date in high school; I was always busy with studies and a part-time job. If any guy tried to ask me out, Chloe and Jessica made sure I never went.

I still remember the night after graduation when there was a party at our house.

FLASHBACK

I was in my room, checking my email about the applications I had submitted to various universities. I could hear the loud music coming from downstairs.

Chloe had invited everyone to the party. She even asked me to join, but I politely declined, knowing she and Jessica would likely have a plan to humiliate me again.

Suddenly, I heard a knock on my door. I closed my laptop and walked over. Opening it, I saw Justin standing there, holding two cans of beer.

""Hey, Sarah!"" he greeted me and walked into my room, sitting on my bed and looking around.

""Hey, Justin! What brings you here?"" I asked, walking towards him.

Justin was in the same grade as me and Chloe. He was one of the popular guys in high school. We weren't close friends, but we had worked on some projects and assignments together. He seemed like a genuine guy.

""Why are you sitting here alone? Why didn't you come downstairs and join us?"" he asked.

""Well, I don't like loud music, and I'm not used to these parties. Besides, I had some important work to do,"" I told him.

""Oh, that's alright. Everyone has their own tastes and choices,"" he said, offering me one of the beers he was holding. I politely declined.

""C'mon, relax a bit, Sarah. One beer won't harm you,"" he chuckled.

I hesitated but eventually accepted the beer and took a sip.

One beer won't harm me.

""So, what are your plans after high school?"" he asked, drinking his beer.

""Well, I'm planning to study architecture, but I haven't decided which university to choose.""

Before I could say more, I started feeling dizzy. I could hear Justin talking, but I couldn't understand what he was saying.

I could faintly hear Chloe and Jessica's voices inside the room. I heard them talking, but I couldn't make out the words.

Jessica's voice came closer as she whispered in my right ear.

""Let's have some fun, Sarah,"" she said, laughing wickedly.

I tried to get up, but Chloe pushed me back onto the bed. My T-shirt was yanked off aggressively, and my jeans were pulled down. I tried to shout for help, but no words came out. I could hear Chloe, Jessica, and Justin giggling.

I was lying there in just my underwear. Someone pulled me closer, and I heard Justin whisper something in my ear. All I could understand was that they were up to something terrible.

Justin gripped my waist, then started svcking on my neck.

""Please... don't,"" I begged them.

But they didn't stop. After a few minutes, I heard Jessica say it was enough; they'd gotten what they wanted.

I sighed in relief, but then I felt someone tugging at my hair. Before I could react, they started cutting it. I struggled with what little energy I had left, but a sharp kick to my ribs knocked me out.

FLASHBACK ENDS

When I regained consciousness, it was already the next day. I was still on the bed, my underwear tor-n. When I looked in the mirror, I saw bruises around my ribs and belly. My hair was nearly all gone—I was almost bald.

Jessica, Justin, and Chloe had made a video of me and Justin in bed. In the video, only my face was visible, while only Justin's back was shown.

They shared the video on every social media platform, and the whole school assumed I had shot it and shared it to gain popularity.

I even told Dad, but he blamed me for not being careful. Later, he chose to believe others, thinking I had purposely shared the video.

A tear slipped down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Because of that night, I couldn't trust any guy. Although I managed to overcome this fear when I moved to Boston, becoming more comfortable around new people, I still struggled.

I even went on a few dates, but things never progressed. I was still uncomfortable with intimacy and trusting anyone.

Thinking about the marriage proposal, I realized I still didn't know who I was supposed to marry. All I knew from Grandpa was that he was the young CEO of a rapidly growing construction company.

I spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, thinking about the marriage and the company merger.

By 4 a.m., after a night of deep contemplation, I was finally ready with my decision.

Chapter 6

Sarah P.O.V

It was nearly 11 in the morning, and I was ready with my decision. I went downstairs and knocked on Grandpa's door; he opened it.

I walked into the room and saw Grandma sitting on the couch, reading a magazine. I sat next to her while Grandpa sat across from us. I cleared my throat before speaking.

""Grandpa, Grandma, I've made my decision. I want to save my mother's company; I don't want to lose Amario Enterprises. I'm ready for the marriage,"" I told them.

As soon as I finished speaking, I saw both my grandparents beaming with happiness. Grandma immediately hugged me tightly.

""Oh Sarah, I knew you would make the right decision. I'm sure this marriage and merger will bring much happiness to your life,"" Grandpa said while kissing my forehead.

""I'm sure you'll fulfil the responsibilities of both a wife and the new CEO of Amario Enterprises,"" Grandma said, clasping her hands together.

Sorry to say but this guy was a typical bag of fail! Over weight, always late to class and a nightmare to work with in group assignments.
Last semester he came back a totally new person & lost noticeable amount of weight.

When we asked how he did the 180, he said "" I switched to Ice coffee 😉""

At first I didn't understand, but others explained to me that it's the slang name for drug!

So I'm thinking of hitting 2 birds with one stone, lose weight and focus on my studies.

What I'm wondering is how addictive is it? He doesn't look like the typical user. Always wear nice clothes, shiny teeth, smells much better than before.

Can I take a little for one semester to focus on my goals then stop!

I don't expect people to fall for me just because l lift weights. But a little appreciation... a small compliment... some form of feminine attention... would've meant something. Because truthfully, I've never experienced that. Never had a coffee date. Never had someone ask how my day was. Never hugged a girl.

I've been on dating apps, tried to start conversations, kept it respectful-but the matches are rare, and replies even rarer. It feels like women here already have a hundred options, and I'm just noise. Sometimes I wonder: is something wrong with me, or is this just how it goes for most guys ?

Approaching women is a last option for me that I avoid because It doesn't feel respectful to myself ..

It started small. She began to forget little details — my mom’s name, how to get to her favorite coffee shop, how she always hated mushrooms. Then she began laughing at shows she used to hate. “King of the Hill” of all things. I remember how she once called it “boring redneck garbage.” But there she was, laughing like she’d never heard anything funnier.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

She blinked. “Why wouldn’t I be?”

“You’re acting… different.”

She smiled. “Maybe I’m growing. You don’t want me to grow?”

It sounded more like a warning than a joke.


---

The next morning, I found her standing in the bathroom, mouth open, eyes wide.

“Emma?”

No response.

She muttered something.

I stepped closer.

“I’m making space,” she said, staring into the mirror.

“For what?”

“For what comes next.”

She turned and smiled. Too wide. Too forced. Like her muscles had forgotten how.

“I love you,” she said, voice soft and unnatural.

Something wasn’t right.


---

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Emma didn’t snore like usual. She just lay still. Eyes open. I leaned in closer.

Tears were pooling in her eyes. Not falling—just there. Waiting.

Her lips moved.

“It’s wearing me.”


---

Things spiraled after that.

She cooked food she never liked. Soup that smelled like copper. Eggs that were… wrong. She locked the bedroom door at night and told me she might hurt me in her sleep.

She stopped answering to her own name.

Then I came home one night and found the walls covered in photos of me—Polaroids. Hundreds. Sleeping. Eating. Showering.

One of them had my face scratched out.


---

I ran.

Stayed at my brother’s place.

That night I got a text from an unknown number.

“You left me here with it.”

“What is ‘it’?” I texted back.

No response.


---

I went back.

When I opened the apartment door, I heard… breathing.

Not human.

Something wet. Heavy. Like lungs struggling through fluid.

She was on the couch. Back to me.

“Emma?”

No reply.

I stepped closer.

She turned.

Her smile was wider than humanly possible. Her lips cracked. Her eyes were black.

“I made space,” she whispered. “It fits now.”

“What fits?”

“It needs your shape.”

Something crawled out from beneath the couch. A fleshy spider-like creature with a mouth full of fingernails. It skittered up the wall, into the ceiling.

Emma convulsed. Then stood.

“It’s inside me now,” she said. “It wants you next.”


---

I locked myself in the bathroom.

She pounded on the door.

She screamed in my voice.

Then it went quiet.


---

I eventually opened the door.

She was gone.

But the walls were covered in drawings of me—melting, splitting, being worn like a costume.

I left. Took a hotel. Tried to forget.

But the texts kept coming.

Photos of me, asleep.

Messages like:

“Almost ready.”

“You’ll feel the crawl soon.”


---

I went to a priest.

He gave me a cross.

That night, I woke up and the metal had melted into the pillow.


---

Eventually… she came for me.

I woke up and she was standing there. Emma.

But not her. Her skin too tight. Her body twitching.

“I don’t want to hurt you,” she said, holding up a malformed hand now fused to that crawling thing.

“But I need to try you on.”


---

I ran. Made it to the stairwell. She followed.

But she didn’t move like a human anymore. She spasmed her way toward me, her smile cracking, eyes leaking black fluid.

“I know you’re in there,” I said. “Emma, if you can hear me…”

She froze.

I took a step forward. “Emma. Baby. Please.”

Her jaw trembled. Her hands shook.

Then she dropped to her knees.

And screamed.


---

It wasn’t just a scream—it was two screams at once. One hers… and one deeper. Older. Something ancient and hungry.

Black veins surfaced on her skin. Her back arched. Her fingers curled into claws.

“I can’t hold it!” she cried. “It’s wearing me!”

I grabbed her shoulders. “Fight it!”

“I’m trying! It’s too deep—”

I looked into her eyes. Behind all the black, I saw her.

The real her.


---

So I held her.

I wrapped my arms around her, even as she convulsed. Even as the skin on her arms began to tear. Even as the thing inside her started to scream back.

“I love you,” I whispered.

“I’m still in here,” she sobbed.

“I know. Come back. You’re stronger.”

Her body shook.

Then something ripped from her back.

The creature. Pink, pulsing, wet. It tumbled onto the floor, screaming in dozens of tiny mouths.

Emma collapsed, gasping.

I stood between her and the thing.

It hissed at me.

I didn’t flinch.

I reached for the fire extinguisher on the wall and slammed it down on the creature.

Once.

Twice.

Until the thing stopped moving.

Until it evaporated into black smoke and vanished.


---

Emma was sobbing.

But she was herself again.

I held her all night.

She told me everything the next day.


---

It had started with a dream. A dream of a voice offering her peace, comfort, purpose. She said yes, not knowing what it meant. The thing needed a “host.” A mind weak enough to manipulate but strong enough to mimic.

She fought it every day.

“I left clues,” she said. “The soup. The drawings. The mirror. I was begging you to notice.”

“You did,” I told her. “And I did. Just in time.”


---

We moved.

Left the apartment. Changed numbers. Got new jobs. New lives.

Emma has nightmares sometimes.

So do I.

But every morning, when I wake up, she’s there. Beside me.

Her smile is real now.

She laughs at stupid cartoons and burns breakfast and sometimes sings off-key in the shower.

She’s herself.

And I love her more than ever.


---

We survived.

Some people don’t.

But we did.

Because I didn’t run.

Because she fought.

Because love—real love—is stronger than any darkness trying to crawl inside. ",1,1752898465.0,stories,2,1.0,False
1m3mz5j,https://i.redd.it/wris6qi2brdf1.jpeg,I think this facility is actually slowing me down...,"Hi all,

Please let me know if I'm going to do something I would regret.

I am 7 days post amputation of my big toe on my left foot. After 13 days of hospitalization to treat me for a severe bone infection and two foot surgeries ending with the amputation, I was discharged and put into a rehab/care facility. I live alone, and a few days ago I didn't think I could care for myself. Heres the thing, the people here, well they completely suck. The only actually useful thing they do is empty my urinal.  That is literally the only thing they do that is helpful. In every other way, I think they're actually a hindrance. Let's look at why I even use a urinal. I guess because I require the staff's help to use the toilet. Heres the thing about that, I get from my bed, to my wheelchair, to and onto (and off of) the toilet completely on my own. Why do i need their help? Because their bathrooms aren't large enough to accommodate a wheelchair, and unless I want my roommate and his wife who is always freaking here, and whoever else is in the room watching me, the staff are necessary to move the wheelchair out of the way, and close the door (and of course the reverse when call button is pushed, and someone wants to get off their ass to do either process.)  It's actually worse.  Let's just say 12 straight days of stool softeners, laxatives, and photo finishes waiting for their help.

The medication,OMG!!!!!  My antibiotics are required through IVs, for i guess another 5 weeks.  This i would say is their most crucial role. I am at least two treatments behind today.  They are going to catch up during late night into early morning. I am so sleep deprived I cant even express it.  I can go home, and the VA is more than happy to send someone to my home to administer the IV.  Regarding my other meds, I couldn't even get a nurse to give me some freaking insulin today until almost 6pm. Don't even get me started about the pain meds!

The food...  Well, the pic was of my first dinner here.  I'm freaking starving!  With the added bonus of being up all night with IVs, I've ordered Uber eats every night I was here.  Tonight, seeing how there is no possible way I can afford to keep doing this, I broke down with vending machine cookies and chips. Goes without mention, im diabetic.  At home, at least if I buy the cheapest frozen meals I can find to pop in the microwave, it would be better.  That would be the easiest thing to do.  Oh, lady brings coffee, asks how I want it. 3 non-dairy packets of creamer and 3 Sweet & Lows.  She comes back with 5 sugars.  I ask for Sweet & Lows, and she basically denied the existence of Sweet & Low (or any sugar substitute), and walked away.

I'm completely handling my own hygiene. In fact, im not even using products from this place to do it.  The VA gave me a bunch of those shower in a towelette packages.  Now that I think about it, there's no way this place even knows I have them.  Do they think I don't clean myself, and are just cool with that?  OMG, I think they are totally cool with it!

Regarding physical therapy, every time a therapist came for me I was waiting for an IV (for much longer than the session would have been), so no therapy except once. Yeah, it was to build up upper body strength, so I can work myself up to stuff I've been doing for quite a while already.  After 11 days of constipation, I finally opened up after the amputation. I had a commode moved next to my bed and bless the staff for letting me handle getting between the two completely unsupervised. There are certain things that are important to me. Going to the toilet by myself is one of those things.  

I forgot to mention, I've had 11 knee surgeries (6L5R) and aren't stable enough to support crutches. The pain, if controlled, is better every day, unless it takes hours to get pain meds after pain emerges. I was morphine, 2 hours later oxycodone, two hours later morphine, etc.  I took myself off the morphine two days before I had to, and while im allowed oxy every 4 hours, im about 7 hours before asking, and sometimes 9 or 10 hours before getting.

Sometimes I ponder deeply on what the future holds for our planet. It’s one of those things that kinda hits me out of nowhere when I'm sipping my morning coffee or watching my cat chase a shadow around the living room. There's this gnawing fear that we aren't doing enough, or maybe that we're doing the wrong things to protect what we've got.

I mean, the trees, the oceans, all the creatures relying on us to get our act together... it's a heavy thought. Sometimes I feel hopeful like small changes can actually lead to something big. Other times, I'm just overwhelmed thinking about how little control I personally have over all this. 

Don't get me wrong, I try to recycle and do my part like everyone else sorta thinking ""maybe it'll make a difference,"" but it feels like a drop in an ocean sometimes. You ever wonder if all our small acts add up or if there's something bigger we should be doing? 

Just needing to let this out there to anyone reading who might get it. Would love to hear your thoughts, whether they're full of hope or just buried in worried questions.

1m3mt8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m3mt8r/halfway_there/,Halfway there!,"Hello all! Long time lurker and first time poster.

Earlier this year, I (22M, 5'10/178cm) reached my heaviest weight of 252 lbs after steadily climbing there since finishing high school. I used to be very active (working outdoors, weightlifting elective, and doing Jiu-Jitsu), so that plus being a teenage boy equaled me eating pretty much whatever I wanted and maintaining 180 lb give or take. Pandemic happened, started college, and quit the outdoors job - you can imagine what happened.

Fast forward to earlier this year, I hit my breaking point: my clothes barely fit me, I sweat like hell if it's the slightest bit above room temperature, and I'm now in a career which depends on my ability to pass a physical every year (diabetes and cardiovascular conditions are both show-stoppers!). The candid photos were also horrid, and I was, quite frankly, having a hard time finding a date.

On the 23rd of March, I decided enough was enough, downloaded MFP, and signed up for the gym near my house. From then on it was weights 4x/week, a 2-mile walk on days I don't lift, and 2,000 calories per day.

For the first month or so, I felt miserable both physically and mentally (I was also dealing with some emotions concerning romantic feelings towards a friend that weren't reciprocated.) My body was screaming at me the mornings after I lifted, and I was *so damn hungry* since this was my first real, intentional deficit in years.

The next month, it got a little easier. I started to share what was going on with me with friends and family, started taking creatine, and dipped my feet into meal prepping. First NSVs:

* Started journaling
* Mom was the first to say I looked slimmer, but at 10 pounds down she was probably just trying to make me feel better. Love you mom <3
* I stopped being so sore after the gym, and it also started to feel wrong if I missed a session.
* I started paying attention to protein intake, and realized how if I spend my calories wisely, I won't be starving before mealtimes.

The month after that, I could truthfully say I felt good. I cut back the alcohol a bit (I still love an occasional glass of mead), the fat was melting off at roughly 1.5lb per week, and I was steadily increasing the weights I could lift. NSVs from this time period:

* Dipped my feet into meal prepping! This saved me a lot of money, since before this, the most reliable way for me to keep track of my calories on-the-fly was expensive, processed, ready-to-eat stuff that had nutrition info on the packaging.
* Treated myself to clothes shopping, and while I was out, bought a new belt since the one I had was starting to slip, even when it was the tightest it would go.
* My posture improved, and my arms/pecs started to look a little more defined.
* The unsolicited diet advice started to roll in. Carbs this, keto that, blah blah blah. Weird how the advice givers aren't having as much success with their own weight loss, but it's rude to point that out to them directly.

More recently, other people were starting to notice. A couple of my coworkers quietly confided in me that they were also losing weight, and I started looking different to myself in the mirror. Yesterday morning I weighed 213 pounds, a little more than halfway to my GW of 180. Some of the more recent NSVs:

* My sister's girlfriend knew I was losing weight, but when she saw me for the first time in a couple months, she said ""WOAH"" first thing after seeing me. Rode that high the rest of the day.
* I've started taking gym selfies, and I actually like how I look in them. Double chin is mostly gone as well!
* My confidence has risen high enough to come clean about my feelings for the aforementioned friend, and while they can't say they feel the same way currently, they're at least open to a date next week. Doesn't matter to me how the date itself goes, honestly - I wouldn't have reached out if I weren't mentally prepared. Fingers crossed, but I'll still be okay if it doesn't work out like I'm hoping.
* Chest day is now the closest thing I have to a religion.

It's been a good chunk of this year, but at the same time, it all feels so fast. To finish it off, here's a list of ""hacks"" I've figured out:

* Artificial sweeteners are great when you don't have some nerd screaming in your ear about how they're not natural. Severe Coke Zero addiction has been acquired on my end.
* Adding onto this, if you're at a restaurant and order diet soda, dip your fingers in it to test - if they're sticky, they accidentally gave you full sugar.
* Sugar free jello plus fat-free Reddi Whip equals a super tasty dessert with so few calories that I don't even bother counting it.
* Eating stuff with chopsticks (not just asian food) slows me down and helps me feel satiated, since a problem I had was with eating too fast and then eating more before I let myself feel satiated.
* The 4 piece crispy strips from Mcdonalds are 40g of protein for 460 calories; pretty good for fast food.
* Mustard and many different hot sauces are either zero calories or a negligible amount.
* I swapped my coffee and creamer for a sugar-free energy drink in the morning. Less calories and still wakes me up, plus the fizz helps me feel fuller until lunch time.
* The joy of sitting down to relax after the most *diabolical* chest/arms day is unmatched. Lift heavy, 8-10 rep range, 8 sets per muscle group per week, and burn calories both during the workout and also the recovery. Maybe it's my growing gymbro streak, but cardio is overrated imo. DM me if you want my workout routine!

Mind you, I look decent but I’m seldom girls’ first choice because I’m only 5 ft. I matched this girl who is dead serious and she is not playing games from the way she interrogated and talked to me. But she is super dense. I almost gave up initially until she downloaded a social chat app that is commonly used in my country to chat with me because that’s the only app that I uses and she said she didn’t want to miss any of my texts on the dating app since she doesn’t have notifications there. I found it cute so I decided to continue talking to her. We are very similar in terms of background. 

I know that chatting online means nothing and I really want to ask her out. Our chat has been going well in text so I figured why not as I have nothing to lose. I texted her a link of an Italian restaurant yesterday and said “let’s go and have this” but the only answer I got was “but it’s so far” and then she proceed to tell me she will be busy at night so she can’t really text me. Today, I tried using a different way by saying “If I guess your blah blah right, how about I buy you a cup of coffee and maybe something to eat?” and she responded by saying “hmmm? How does that work?”. I got slightly off putted so I just said “I’M TRYNA ASK YOU OUT” and “JEEZUZ”.

Just a door away, the conversation in the corner of the medical wing continued.  
  
""Get the OR ready. Remove her womb. Make sure it’s done before she wakes.""  
  
The pack healer went rigid with shock.  
  
""Alpha... Remove her womb?!""  
  
""Alpha—you don't have an heir! You do this, the pack will have no heir. The pack elders will never accept it!""  
  
Cassian's voice was ice-cold, devoid of emotion.  
  
""I don’t need an heir from Evelyn Carter. Annabelle delivered my heir yesterday. He will inherit everything. Evelyn’s womb is a threat.""  
  
The healer's face crumpled with disbelief.  
  
""But that boy will carry another man's name, call another man Alpha. After seven miscarriages, The chances of Luna carrying another are barely there.""  
  
Cassian lit a cigarette, his voice bitter.  
  
""Annabelle is my true mate, I’d do anything for her, I don't care some Moon Goddess pairing.""  
  
""Alpha, but—""  
  
""Enough."" He frowned. ""Do it.""  
  
Just as Cassian got up to go, his phone buzzed. He hit speaker by mistake.  
  
""Alpha, got the cash. Hell, after seven jobs, I could do this shit in my sleep. Next time, I’ll wear a vampire disguise—really carve up that Luna's belly—""  
  
""No next time. Take your money and disappear from Moonvale.""  
  
Footsteps approached from deeper inside.  
  
I stumbled back to my room, barely making it to the bed before Cassian entered.  
  
""Evelyn, you're up. When did you wake up?""  
  
Sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to appear normal.  
  
""Just woke up. You weren't here, so I thought I'd stretch my legs.""  
  
His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face.  
  
My wolf whimpered with terror. Just when I thought he'd caught me, he scooped me up and settled me back on the bed.  
  
""Baby, you scared the hell out of me. We already lost our pup—I can't handle losing you too.""  
  
He dared to mention our pup.  
  
Thinking of all the puppies he'd murdered, I pressed a hand to my chest as grief threatened to overwhelm me.  
  
Those accidents, the attacks, the fall—all of it orchestrated by my own mate.  
  
""The heal needs to do a follow-up procedure. Just to make sure everything's healing properly.""  
  
""I know losing the baby hurts, but we'll try again. We'll have the most beautiful pup—strong like their Alpha, gentle like their mother.""  
  
Cassian handed me a vial of potion. In the brief moment he turned away, I saw a thick, dark liquid shimmer as something else mixed in and vanished.  
  
He pulled me close, his expression soft with false concern.  
  
But I could see through the mask now. Every gentle touch was a lie.  
  
""Do I really need to drink this? I'm not very thirsty...""  
  
Cassian, you've slaughtered seven of my children. Now you want to steal my very ability to be a mother?  
  
He didn't even pause, stroking my hair with that practiced tenderness.  
  
""Come on, don't be difficult. You need your strength to heal. You want your Alpha to worry himself sick?""  
  
""Let me help you with that.""  
  
He pressed the glass to my lips, his grip firm enough that refusal wasn't an option.  
  
I closed my eyes, each swallow feeling like liquid fire burning down my throat.  
  
As the drugs took hold, I saw the healer slip into the room through my blurring vision.  
  
""Begin immediately. And...""  
  
Cassian's voice dropped to barely a whisper.  
  
""Make sure she can’t walk again.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Alpha, is this really necessary? Isn’t that… a little too cruel?""  
  
""Do it!""  
  
I knew Cassian was always calculating and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me awake early would push him to such cruelty.  
  
My puppy, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to walk—he was taking everything.  
  
Cassian, is this how you treat the mate the Moon Goddess chose for you?  
  
My wolf howled inside me, wild and silent with fury.  
  
I screamed silently in despair, struggling to sit up, but the darkness pulled me deeper.  
  
As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the healer's voice through the haze:  
  
""Alpha, her womb has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""  
  
Cassian's voice was filled with satisfaction. ""Good. Perfect.""  
  
When I fully awakened, tears were falling onto my hands—his tears, so convincingly real.  
  
""Evelyn, the healer says infection damaged your womb. You'll never be able to have children.""  
  
I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.  
  
Nothing. No sensation at all.  
  
I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded:  
  
""Cassian, what did you do to my legs?""  
  
Tears streamed down his face, his voice breaking with practiced grief.  
  
""There were complications with the anesthesia. You're paralyzed from the waist down.""  
  
""Don't be scared, baby... no matter what happens, I'll never leave you. I'll always love you.""  
  
I'd never realized what a gifted actor my mate was.  
  
He dismissed the nurses, personally feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even tending to the post-surgical bleeding himself.  
  
He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.  
  
""You've suffered so much for our pack. I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""  
  
I studied his exhausted face, then looked away coldly.  
  
""You should rest if you're tired.""  
  
""I'll stay right here with you. Just call if you need anything.""  
  
Once he was asleep, I reached for his second phone.  
  
I'd always known about Cassian's other device—his ""work phone""—but had never thought to check it.  
  
The password worked on the first try.  
  
Annabelle's birthday.  
  
The lock screen showed their wedding photo.  
  
A wedding photo... He'd married her in secret. The white dress seared my eyes.  
  
With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. He called her ""baby"" in every text.  
  
Endless conversations that grew more horrifying with each scroll.  
  
Every business trip had been a lie—excuses to be with her.  
  
All those times I'd been hurt that he never came to my doctor appointments.  
  
When physicians asked about the Alpha, I'd smile awkwardly and say he was busy with Alpha duties.  
  
His standard response was always the same:  
  
""I’ve been tied up with pack affairs. Check-ups aren't a big deal—I'd just be in the way. You can handle routine things yourself.""  
  
But he'd attended every single one of Annabelle's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy, he never missed one.  
  
He wrote about how excited he was for their child, calling them the most precious thing in his world.  
  
Scrolling further, my heart shattered completely.  
  
Every time I got pregnant, they planned how to kill my child.  
  
Even the car accident from a year ago—Annabelle had been behind the wheel.  
  
She'd said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone. Cassian had eagerly agreed.  
  
His only instruction: ""Try not to kill her outright.""  
  
They discussed hurting me and murdering my children as casually as commenting on the weather.  
  
My nails dug into my palms until blood dripped between my fingers.  
  
The photo album contained thousands of pictures—all of Annabelle. Candid shots, selfies together, morning scenes, walks, intimate dinners where he'd prepared special meals for her pregnancy...  
  
There were 99+ videos. I switched to that section and felt ice water flood my veins.  
  
Countless recordings of their intimate moments, like they were documenting every encounter.  
  
Even role-playing scenarios that made my stomach turn.  
  
I pressed my hand to my mouth, fighting nausea.  
  
But worse were six videos labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way to ""Sixth.""  
  
Realizing what they contained, bile rose in my throat as blood filled my mouth.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I bit down hard on my lip and opened the sixth video.  
  
Cassian and Annabelle were laughing together.  
  
In front of them lay...my unboren puppy.  
  
The blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My wolf howled in agony, the pain causing my stomach to cramp violently.  
  
I couldn't hold back anymore, leaning over the bed rail as dry heaves wracked my body.  
  
I didn't sleep that night, my wolf pacing restlessly in my mind as tears soaked through my hospital gown.  
  
The next morning, Cassian brought me breakfast as usual—an elaborate spread he'd personally selected.  
  
Pancakes, fresh fruit, coffee, pastries...  
  
I'd once thought this was his way of showing love. Now I knew it was just thoughtless guilt, buying his way out of actually caring.  
  
Remembering the videos, I dry heaved again.  
  
Seeing my distress, Cassian's expression filled with concern:  
  
""Still feeling sick? Damn it, this is all my fault. I hate seeing my mate like this.""  
  
""I'm fine. I want to go home.""  
  
Something flickered across Cassian's face—a moment of tension.  
  
""You just lost another pup. My mother isn't... handling it well. If you go back to the pack house now, you'll just walk into a shitstorm. Maybe we should wait until things cool down.""  
  
I said nothing, but his expression told me everything I needed to know.  
  
That afternoon, while he was gone, I packed my things and wheeled myself to the pack house.  
  
I rolled through the front door to find Annabelle curled up in Cassian's lap, both of them cooing over a baby whose scent carried unmistakable traces of Graves bloodline.  
  
Margaret emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of bone broth, personally feeding Annabelle spoonful by spoonful.  
  
The three of them looked like the perfect family unit.  
  
The moment Margaret caught my scent, her eyes flashed with her wolf's displeasure.  
  
""Well, well. Look what crawled back to the den. You've got some nerve showing your face here after what you've done.""  
  
""My Alpha son treats you like a precious mate, and this is how you repay him? Another dead heir. You're cursed, and you're bringing that curse into our pack!""  
  
""Annabelle is the one deserves to be Luna of the Moonvale Pack. Get out of my territory—you're poison to this pack.""  
  
Annabelle followed Margaret's gaze to me, her eyes glittering with the triumph:  
  
""Luna Margaret, don't be so harsh. What if Evelyn gets upset and starts spreading lies about Alpha and me to the other packs?""  
  
""Let her try. No pack leader gives a damn what a barren she-wolf has to say.""  
  
I knew Margaret had always despised me. She thought I was too headstrong for an Alpha's mate, too independent—that I'd challenge her son's authority instead of submitting properly.  
  
Annabelle was everything she wanted: beautiful, submissive, making Cassian the center of her universe like a proper Luna should.  
  
She'd only wanted Annabelle as her son's mate, but then Annabelle married into another pack, and I'd given up everything to be the perfect Alpha's mate.  
  
Margaret had reluctantly accepted me into the pack.  
  
But years of failed pregnancies had pushed her resentment to the breaking point.  
  
Now that Annabelle was back—with Cassian's heir—Margaret felt free to unleash every bit of venom she'd been storing.  
  
If only she knew that every one of those lost pups had been orchestrated by her beloved Alpha.  
  
Every grandchild she'd mourned had been murdered by the woman she was now treating like precious pack treasure.  
  
In the past, Cassian would have used his Alpha command to intervene. Now he sat there holding Annabelle's child, acting like he couldn't hear a word.  
  
Annabelle nestled deeper into his arms:  
  
""Cassian, you're paying more attention to the pup than to me. Your wolf is making mine jealous.""  
  
Cassian's expression melted with adoration as he nuzzled her neck, scenting her:  
  
""You know you're my true mate. But look what I have for you.""  
  
I followed Annabelle's delighted gaze to a document on the coffee table: ""Pack Territory Transfer Agreement.""  
  
""Oh my God, Cassian! You're giving me pack lands?""  
  
She kissed the corner of his mouth, shooting me a triumphant look over his shoulder.  
  
I smiled back coldly, my wolf finally going still in my mind.  
  
Enjoy it while you can.  
  
Soon enough, you and your precious Alpha will be crawling back to me, begging.

Three years ago, my home office looked like a productivity guru wet dream. Two 4K monitors, a $400 ergonomic keyboard that supposedly ""increased typing efficiency by 23%,"" a standing desk that cost more than my first car, noise-canceling headphones, three different project management apps running simultaneously, and a color-coded calendar system that would make Marie Kondo weep with joy.

The result? I was spending 2+ hours every day just *managing* my productivity system instead of actually being productive.

# The Breaking Point That Nobody Talks About

What finally broke me wasn't some dramatic failure. It was this embarrassingly mundane moment when I caught myself spending 45 minutes researching the ""optimal"" way to categorize a simple client email. Meanwhile, my competitor (who I later learned was working off a beat-up MacBook from his kitchen table) had already responded to his clients and closed two deals.

That's when it hit me - all this optimization had turned me into someone who was optimizing optimization instead of optimizing results.

# What Actually Changed Everything

Here's the uncomfortable truth that productivity Twitter doesn't want you to know: **the tools that helped me 3X my revenue were embarrassingly simple.**

Instead of my elaborate setup, what actually moved the needle:

**A single notebook** where I write down the ONE thing that, if completed today, would actually matter to my business. Not three things. Not five. One.

**My phone's basic notes app** for capturing ideas during the day. No tags, no categories, no smart notifications. Just a running list that I review weekly.

**One browser bookmark folder** labeled ""Today"" with max 3 links. If something new needs to go in, something else has to come out.

**Email checked twice daily.** Period. The world didn't end. Clients didn't flee. Opportunities weren't missed.

# The Revenue Jump Nobody Expected

Within 6 months of this ""downgrade,"" my revenue went from $8K/month to $24K/month.

But here's what's weird - it wasn't because I suddenly became more efficient. It was because I started focusing on activities that actually generated revenue instead of activities that *felt* productive.

Turns out there's a massive difference between being busy optimizing your system and being busy serving customers.

# Why This Approach Feels Wrong (But Works)

The resistance to this simplicity runs deep. We're conditioned to believe that complex problems require complex solutions. That successful people must have elaborate systems. That if you're not using the latest productivity hack, you're falling behind.

But what I discovered was that complexity often becomes a sophisticated form of procrastination. Every minute spent perfecting your workflow is a minute not spent on the work that pays.

# The Unsexy Truth About Getting Shit Done

Real productivity isn't about having the perfect system. It's about having enough clarity to know what matters and enough discipline to ignore what doesn't.

My current ""system"" would make productivity enthusiasts cringe:

* I work from a coffee shop with a 6-year-old laptop
* I use a paper notebook that costs $3
* My ""CRM"" is a simple Google Sheet
* I batch similar tasks instead of time-blocking every minute

Revenue keeps growing. Stress keeps dropping. Time spent on ""productivity"" is now invested in actually producing things that matter.

**What's the most expensive productivity tool you've bought that didn't actually make you more productive?** Curious if I'm the only one who fell into this trap...

## Key Features Analysis

The availability and reliability of replacement parts significantly contribute to the overall longevity and value of a appliance like the ninja coffee maker.

**Carafe:** The carafe is a basic component, usually made of glass or thermal stainless steel, designed to hold the brewed coffee. Selecting a replacement carafe that is both durable and compatible with your specific ninja coffee maker model is essential. Look for options with easy-pour spouts and clearly marked measurement lines.

A high-quality carafe should withstand temperature fluctuations and regular use without cracking or leaking. Check dimensions to ensure perfect fit on the warming plate to prevent damage to the plate over time.

**Water Reservoir:** Responsible for holding the water used in the brewing process, the water reservoir is often made of BPA-free plastic. Replacement reservoirs should precisely match the original in terms of capacity and secure attachments to the coffee maker base.

A properly functioning reservoir ensures efficient water flow and prevents leaks, which can damage the unit. The reservoir should also have clear water level indicators.

**Filter Basket:** The filter basket holds the coffee filter and grounds during brewing. Replacement filter baskets should be made of durable materials that can withstand heat and moisture. Check for compatibility with both paper filters and permanent filters.

A well-designed filter basket ensures proper coffee extraction and prevents grounds from escaping into the brewed coffee. Consider options with features like overflow prevention.

**Frother Attachment:** Some ninja coffee maker models include a built-in frother for creating specialty coffee drinks. The frother attachment, typically made of plastic or metal, may need replacement due to wear or damage.

Choose replacement frother attachments that are easy to clean and produce consistent, high-quality froth. Check compatibility with steam wand accessories.

**Brewer Head/Spray Nozzle:** The brewer head, or spray nozzle, distributes hot water over the coffee grounds during brewing. Over time, it can become clogged with mineral deposits or damaged. Ensuring that you are getting the version of the spray nozzle that precisely mirrors the original enhances the brewing and prevents uneven extraction.

A clean and properly functioning brewer head is crucial for even coffee extraction and optimal flavor. Regular cleaning and occasional replacement can significantly improve brewing performance.Key features of Ninja Coffee Maker Replacement Parts include:

* Model-Specific Compatibility
* Durable Materials
* Easy Installation
* Optimal Brewing Performance

You Won’t Believe Why,"**Chapter 1** The moment she disappeared behind the toilet door, he reached for her wine glass with shaky hands. From his pocket, he pulled out a well-wrapped powdery substance. He quickly sprinkled it into her drink and stirred it gently, then set it back in place like nothing happened. By the time she returned, he handed her the drink.

Few minutes after she took the drink, she began to feel dizzy. Soon she fell asleep. He carried her gently, laid her in bed, and tucked her under the covers. Then he picked his phone and made a call. You can come in now, he said simply. Moments later, a man walked in. Damian looked at him, his expression cold. “She’s asleep.” “Do what I paid you to do,” he told the man.

Then he turned off the light and left the room. It was a bright Saturday afternoon. Roda could barely contain her excitement as she drove home from the hospital, one hand gripping the wheel, the other resting protectively on her belly. Her heart beat faster than normal with overwhelming joy. “Finally,” she whispered to herself, smiling through tears.

“Finally, God has done it for me.” She had waited five long years for this day. 5 years of hospital visits, fertility drugs, awkward questions from relatives, and late night cries into her pillow. But today, the test had confirmed it. She was pregnant. Roda smiled as she parked her car in the driveway. She stepped out and rushed into the house.

She wanted to make the moment perfect. She entered the kitchen and began preparing her husband’s favorite, Jolof rice with grilled chicken, peppered snails. She even lit two scented candles and placed a small flower vase at the center of the table. She wanted the evening to be unforgettable. As she set the plates, she imagined Damian’s reaction, how he would lift her off her feet and twirl her around the living room, shouting for joy. By the time he arrived, everything was set.

Roda wore a simple but elegant gown and a warm smile. “Welcome, my love,” she beamed, hugging him as he stepped in. “Damian looked a bit tired, but he smiled faintly.” “What’s all this?” he asked, glancing at the dining table. “You’ll find out soon,” Roda said playfully. “Go and freshen up.” He shrugged and went into the bedroom. A few minutes later, they sat together at the table and began to eat.

Then Roda reached into her bag and pulled out a small white envelope. She slid it across the table. “Open it,” she said softly. Demian gave her a curious look, opened the envelope, and pulled out the lab report. A moment passed. His eyes scanned the lines, and Roda waited, watching his face. Then came the words, “You’re pregnant?” Tears welled up in her eyes as she nodded, a big smile on her face. “Yes, baby. We’re going to have a baby.

” Damian leaned back in his chair slowly. “Wow, that’s that’s good.” Roda’s smile faded a little. Good. Just good. Damian quickly leaned forward again. No, I mean, it’s amazing. Really, I’m just surprised, that’s all. But Roda could feel it. The joy she expected to see in his eyes wasn’t there.

**Chapter: 2**

The excitement, the laughter, the tight hug, it was all missing. He continued eating, nodding slowly, his mind clearly somewhere else. She tried to shake it off. “Maybe he’s in shock,” she told herself later that night. The next morning, she woke up early and prepared for her usual routine. She owned a big supermarket which she managed long before she met and got married to Damian.

The days passed. Her belly began to grow. She took her supplements, went for regular checkups, and counted the days until her baby would arrive. But Damian remained distant. He did what was expected. Drove her to the hospital, paid for her drugs, helped around the house. But something was off. He no longer called her my queen. At night, he slept with his back turned.

Roda prayed about it. She cried in silence. She tried to talk to him once, but he simply said, “I’m just stressed with work.” So, she focused on herself and her unborn baby. 9 months later, on a quiet Tuesday morning, Roda felt the first real contraction. Damian rushed her to the hospital.

After hours of labor, she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Moments after she had been cleaned up and moved to the ward, Damian entered the room with a neutral smile and walked toward her. He gave her a gentle tap and smiled lovingly, but he didn’t touch the baby. When they were discharged, he drove them home.

When they got home, Roda’s mother was invited to come nurse the baby and help out in the house. She arrived 2 days later, beaming with joy and holding a cooler of hot pepper soup. Her eyes lit up when she saw her grandchild. “Oh my god,” she exclaimed. “She’s so beautiful, just like her mother.” On the eighth day, the baby was named Diamond. Despite the arrival of Diamond, Roda was unhappy. She had imagined this moment so differently.

Some days later, after putting Diamond to sleep, Rooda lay in bed waiting for her husband. He didn’t come. She found him in the guest room spreading a wrapper on the bed. “Damian,” she asked, confused, “what are you doing here?” He didn’t look up. “You need your rest. I don’t want to disturb you.

The baby might wake up any time and you need to heal properly, she stared at him. But I want you beside me. I’ll come back when you’re stronger, he said with finality. And with that, he lay down and faced the wall. Weeks turned into months. Roda’s mother, oblivious to the growing gap between the couple, took care of the baby with joy and passion. Damian did all he was supposed to do.

**Chapter: 3**

Paid the bills, bought diapers, asked how the baby was doing, but never once carried his daughter. He never looked at her with the pride or tenderness of a new father. Sometimes, when the baby cried, he would simply leave the room. 6 months after the baby was born, they had still not shared intimacy, not even once.

One evening, Roda summoned the courage to speak up. She waited until the baby had slept and approached him in their bedroom. “I miss you,” she said quietly. Damian looked up from his phone. “I’m here, am I not?” “That’s not what I mean, and you know it. It’s been 6 months, Damian. You haven’t even touched me.” He sighed. You needed time to heal.

I didn’t want to rush anything. That night, Roda cried silently on her side of the bed, facing the wall, while Damian snored behind her. When her mother left a few days later, the house lost its warmth. They began to live like strangers, speaking only when necessary, moving like shadows around each other.

Roda would breastfeed her baby, rock her to sleep, then crawl into bed and cry into her pillow. She didn’t know what she had done wrong. The only person she confided in was her best friend, Adiola, who simply saluted her to be patient and prayerful. Every night she whispered prayers with trembling lips, but nothing changed. One night after putting Diamond to sleep, Roda sat on the edge of the bed staring into the darkness.

Damian was lying beside her, scrolling through his phone. She took a deep breath. “Damian,” she said, her voice calm but firm. He grunted in response without looking up. “What exactly is going on between us?” she asked. He finally looked up. “What do you mean?” You know what I mean? She said, eyes stinging with unshed tears.

For over a year, we’ve been like roommates. You barely speak to me. You avoid the baby. You sleep in the guest room most nights. Damian, is there something you’re not telling me? He sighed and looked back at his phone. There’s nothing to talk about, Roda. Everything’s fine. Everything is not fine. She snapped, her voice rising. You treat me like a stranger.

You treat our daughter like like she’s invisible. You make love to me only when it suits you. And when you do, there’s no affection in it. Just obligation. You won’t talk to me. You won’t hold me. You won’t even look at me. How is that fine? Damian dropped his phone on the bed and sat up. Look, I’m doing the best I can, okay? I pay the bills. I’ve never hit you. I haven’t cheated.

**Chapter: 4**

So, what else do you want from me? Tears rolled down Roda’s cheeks. I want a husband, Damian. I want love. I want my friend back. Damian stood up without another word and walked out of the room. That was the night Roda stopped trying. She threw herself into her supermarket, pouring her energy into her business and her daughter. She stopped waking up at night.

She stopped texting him during the day. She stopped pretending that anything would change. And Damian didn’t seem to care. He only came to her when he wanted to. No warning, no affection, just brief, empty intimacy that left her feeling more alone than before. She began to count down to Diamond’s first birthday with a mix of joy and dread.

The party was small, just a few neighbors and her best friend, Adola. Damian attended, standing stiffly at the corner of the compound while Roda carried their daughter, smiling for the sake of the guests. He didn’t even hold Diamond once during the entire celebration. He left early, claiming work.

The next morning, she stood in front of Damian in the kitchen while he sipped his coffee and scrolled through his phone as usual. “I want to leave this marriage,” she said simply. He didn’t look up. She waited. Then he said, “Okay.” Roda blinked, expecting at least a flinch, a protest, a question, but there was none. “That’s it?” she asked. He shrugged. “You’ve clearly made up your mind?” she nodded slowly. “Yes, I have.” “For my sanity, for my daughter.

I can’t keep living like this. This isn’t marriage, Damian. It’s a slow death. Damian turned and rinsed his cup at the sink. Then he walked out of the kitchen. It was the deepest pain Roda had ever felt because her decision to leave meant nothing to him. Within a week, she found a small but cozy two-bedroom apartment. She furnished it and moved in.

Damian didn’t ask where she was going. That evening, after settling into the new apartment, Roda sat on the floor with her daughter and wept. Later, she called her mother and her best friend Adola. She told them she had left Damian, and she also warned them not to try talking to her or fixing the marriage. So, Roda began a new life, alone, but no longer lonely.

**Chapter: 5**

She poured her love into Diamond and her business. Damian never called. He didn’t ask after their daughter. It was as though they had never shared a life at all. One quiet afternoon, Roda was walking through the aisles of her supermarket, inspecting the arrangement of goods and mentally noting items that needed restocking.

She had just turned toward the toiletry section when she saw a familiar frame, tall, calm, and browsing the shelf like any regular customer. Her breath caught in her throat. “James,” she called out, unsure for a moment if her eyes were playing tricks on her. The man turned. When his eyes met hers, they widened with recognition and surprise. A smile slowly spread across his face.

“Roda,” she walked toward him slowly. “I can’t believe this,” she said, her voice a mix of surprise and emotion. They shared a brief hug. It had been years. James was not just any man from her past. He was her ex, the one she had once been engaged to, the one she had loved so deeply that they were already planning their wedding before everything shattered. Back then, their love had seemed unshakable.

Until that tragic day when James was arrested. He had helped a woman he saw by the roadside appearing sick and weak who had begged him to take her to the hospital. He agreed to give her a lift, but before they could get to the hospital, the woman died in his car.

The investigation that followed turned his act of kindness into a nightmare. The woman’s family claimed she was in perfect health and the law didn’t believe his story. James was eventually convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Roda had stood by him as long as she could. She visited, prayed, cried.

But during one of those visits, he had looked into her eyes and told her to move on with her life. He couldn’t bear to keep her waiting. And so, with a heart that bled in silence, she did. Shortly after, she met Damian and they courted for a while before they got married. Now seeing James again after everything felt like looking at a chapter she had closed, but never truly stopped rereading in her mind.

“Come,” she said softly, leading him to her office. He followed her through the store and into a small, neat office at the back. She offered him a seat. They talked for a while, catching up in gentle tones. Roda opened up about her recent heartbreak, how her marriage to Damian had started with so much love and hope, only to unravel the moment she shared the news of her pregnancy.

She spoke about the distance, the silence, the pain of being treated like a burden. James listened quietly, nodding with understanding. From that day on, James began stopping by at the supermarket and at her house once in a while. He would call occasionally, too, just to check in. But he never overstepped. He never brought up the past or tried to revive anything.

He simply showed up gently and consistently. 3 months had passed since Roda walked out of her marriage. She had finally begun to feel like herself again. Her smile was becoming genuine, her heart lighter, but nothing prepared her for the call that came one quiet morning. She was lying on her bed, scrolling through photos of Diamond in her phone when her phone buzzed.

It was her friend Ediola. “Hello, Adola,” Roda said cheerfully. But the tone on the other end wasn’t light. “Roda, please don’t be upset. I heard something and I felt you needed to know. Roda sat up, her heart slowly picking up pace. What is it? I I heard that a woman now lives with Damianne. The room fell silent. Roda stared at the wall.

1m3mojw,https://i.redd.it/8n2pphp98rdf1.png,Synchronicticwhat Prt. 2,"So in my post a few days ago Synchronicticwhat, I share a story of how I met my best friend. In that story I share of my travels with her when I was 17. 
What I didn't share in that story was of a motorcycle ministry group that stopped my buddy and I while we were hitchhiking. They called themselves ""Highways And Hedges"". They appeared to be a 55+ group of very kind people that fed me and my buddy, shared some gospel with us (even though he and I weren't really into that at 17) and they prayed over us and also gave us some money. Very kind group in my opinion. 

What I am going to share with yall now may sound far fetched. I understand this. I had to place myself in the shoes of the listener back in 2013 until I understood why many cannot believe me of my experiences. They are quite unbelievable to be honest and thats ok.

So yeah, Highways And Hedges, at 17.
Fast forward to 2013....Im basically living on the streets and am very early into my journey to seek help for my girlfriend. 
I frequented this one spot in Hollywood. The employees of a store were always so kind to me in letting me use their facilities. They called me the homeless guy that wasn't homeless 😆

Well one morning when I awoke I went this very store to wash up and get breakfast and am greeted by the am crew. I goto the washroom to clean up (mind you, I leave these facilities either the same way I entered them or better).
As Im washing my face I look upon the mirror and got super spooked!
Another side note, alcohol, drug and mental health issues free.
I hurry out the washroom with my face still wet. Two of the store associates see me coming out the washroom and say ""Hey Will! Good morning 😊""
One of them asked me if I was ok and added, It looks like you've seen a ghost. 
I responded Good morning and added I think I did.

I goto the coffee bar and get my coffee and then found a table at the patio outside to sit at.
I was still kinda freaked out about ""Who"" was looking back at me in the mirror. 

For some strange reason I decided to look up Highways And Hedges Motorcycle Ministry. I have not thought of them since me and my buddies encounter with them at 17, I was now 37 at the time of this event on the patio. 

Yeah, so I look them up on facebook mere minutes after the mirror event. And it absolutely freaked me out even more when I saw their very 1st post of the day.

Why? Well Ill let you figure out who was looking back at me from within the mirror in the washroom based on the screenshot Im attaching to this post.

The very interesting thing about this experience is that it was me in the mirror, but it was Him too. And we look so much alike. I was Him, He I.
Im getting goosebumps just writing that last line and recalling this encounter mentality. I see it bright as day right now and now Im tearing up.

I don't know what's going on on our planet. I do but I dont at the same time.
Soooo many people are experiencing the phenomena regarding the numerical synchronicity (111, 1111, 1121 ect) and non stop synchronicity. This is happening all over the world. With more and more people newly experiencing with each passing moment.

# The AI Video Generator System That Prints Money 💰

Same quality content.

Here's the exact system I use to dominate with this AI video generator.

# Step 1: The AI Video Generator Foundation Setup ⚙️

# Step 2: The AI Video Generator Prompt Formula That Always Works 📝

Most people fail with this AI video generator because they use terrible prompts.

Here's my proven formula:

**\[EMOTION PROGRESSION\] + \[PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION\] + \[SETTING DETAILS\] + \[AUDIO CUES\] + \[AUTHENTICITY MARKERS\]**

**Bad AI Video Generator Prompt:** ""Person using skincare product.""

**Good AI Video Generator Prompt:** ""Young woman with natural morning hair in bathroom mirror, initially tired expression building to genuine surprise and delight, applying face serum with natural hand movements, soft window lighting creating realistic shadows, coffee brewing sounds in background, unmade bed visible through doorway, realistic skin texture with natural imperfections.""

The AI video generator responds to detailed psychological direction.

# Step 3: The AI Video Generator Content Categories That Convert 🎯

**Category 1: Product Discovery Videos**

AI Video Generator Prompt Template:  
""\[AGE\] \[GENDER\] in \[NATURAL SETTING\] trying \[PRODUCT\] for first time, initially \[SKEPTICAL EMOTION\] building to \[SURPRISE\] and \[EXCITEMENT\], \[NATURAL LIGHTING\], \[BACKGROUND SOUNDS\], \[AUTHENTICITY DETAILS\].""

Example: ""Mid-30s woman in cozy kitchen trying new protein powder, initially skeptical expression building to genuine surprise and satisfaction, morning sunlight through window, coffee brewing in background, dishes in sink and fruit on counter.""

**Category 2: Problem-Solution Demonstrations**

AI Video Generator Prompt Template:  
""\[PERSON DESCRIPTION\] dealing with \[SPECIFIC PROBLEM\], showing \[STRUGGLE\], then using \[SOLUTION\] with \[NATURAL PROGRESSION\] from \[FRUSTRATION\] to \[RELIEF\] to \[SATISFACTION\], \[REALISTIC SETTING\].""

Example: ""College student in messy dorm room struggling with tangled earbuds, showing natural frustration, trying new wireless earbuds with growing amazement at sound quality, genuine smile spreading across face, textbooks and clothes scattered realistically.""

**Category 3: Lifestyle Integration Videos**

AI Video Generator Prompt Template:  
""\[PERSON\] incorporating \[PRODUCT\] into \[DAILY ROUTINE\], natural \[TIME OF DAY\] activities, authentic \[ENVIRONMENT\], building from \[ROUTINE\] to \[ENHANCED EXPERIENCE\].""

Example: ""Remote worker in home office adding new coffee blend to morning routine, starting with regular morning energy, building to enhanced focus and satisfaction, realistic work setup with laptop and papers, morning light and distant traffic sounds.""

This AI video generator creates rich soundscapes.

**Lighting Psychology:** Different lighting creates different trust levels:

# Step 8: The AI Video Generator Troubleshooting Guide 🔧

**Problem: Character Inconsistency** Solution: Use detailed physical descriptions. ""Brown hair in messy bun, green eyes, casual Saturday morning energy."" Tip: Save successful character descriptions for reuse.

**Problem: Background Looks Too Perfect** Solution: Add authenticity markers. ""Unmade bed visible, coffee mug with ring stain, mail on counter."" Effect: Increases trust and conversion rates.

1m3mo4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/comments/1m3mo4z/song_with_female_vocalist_that_goes_come_all_this/,"Song with female vocalist that goes ""come all this way, just to ask me to dance""","Bit of a long shot, but I heard this song in a coffee shop (Tim Hortons) like a decade ago, and it's been stuck in my head since. I've tried looking it up but haven't had any luck

The biggest thing I remember about this song is that the chorus went something like ""Come all this way / Just to ask me to dance"".

There may have been another line about ""going across the stars"" or something like that. It's been a long time so these lyrics may be off. I think the general vibe of the song was this female artist being interested in someone and that person approaching her.

The singer was female and the melody was very light and soft, almost like a lullaby. It sounded sort of indie I think. I don't remember much about the instruments, but it could have been either a guitar or some sort of xylophone like instrument, or some combination of both.

Any help would be appreciated!

In the past week they recently added a new character called ""Squirrelie"" who has been replacing what normally would either be a Mushie / Birdie character.

Growing up my psychotic mother never got along with anyone so she always kept me home. At the age of 16 I was removed by the county and then basically aged out of the foster system. 

For the last 8 years (I’m 24 now) I’ve been on my own. I’ve tried my best to form close relationships with friends, find role models, and even dating which hasn’t worked out for me. If anything the fallouts and rejections have made me feel significantly worse. I do have two close friends but one moved over a 100 miles away and the other is just not as available given hes in a relationship now (I’m happy for him). Unfortunately the only connection I can seem to get is sex (Grindr and sniffies) which I’ve used as a crutch. 

I am in therapy. My therapist thinks a lot of what brings me down is circumstantial and that I should be hopeful for the future. I just finished community college and I’m moving upstate to start at university. I get what he means about being hopeful and that a shift like this can be good, but I just feel so lonely. Like I’m drifting in space by myself. I often go days where my only social interaction is at work since I finished classes a while back.

What I’m saying is not only do I feel the damage of where I came from but I fear I’ll never have the support system I desire. Being a lone wolf is always so romanticized. It’s not that I can’t enjoy my own company it’s just all I do at this point. I go to the movies by myself, I go get coffee by myself, I go to the gym by myself, I come home and I’m just by myself. It gets old.

I just had to share this piece because I honestly can’t stop looking at it. It’s on hand and ready to go, so no long lead times if someone’s been searching for something truly unique.
💎Center stone: 7.01ct Asscher‑cut lab‑grown diamond in a gorgeous coffee/brown tone
💎Dimensions: 10.44 × 10.44 × 7.17 mm
The cut really shows off those step facets—when the light hits, it has that hypnotic “hall of mirrors” effect.
💎Side stones: Trapezoid diamonds
Dimensions: 5 × 5 × 7 mm each
They frame the center beautifully, giving it a strong, architectural feel.
💎Setting: 14k yellow gold
The warm tone of the gold pairs so well with the brown hue—it feels vintage‑inspired but still modern.
💍Ring size: US 6

1m3mmde,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m3mmde/i_think_my_best_friend_isnt_really_my_best_friend/,I think my best friend isn't really my best friend :(,"Hi! I'm a 26 year old female and my friend who we will call Jennifer is a 24 year old female. 
Jennifer and I have known of each other for a while and we became friends 2-3 years ago.
We became very close very quickly she and I have said we feel more like sisters than just friends.
So I started calling her my best friend. I have said this in front of her aswell. I met one of her other friends we will call Clarissa, 21 year old female, about 3 months into becoming friends with Jennifer. 
The night I met Clarissa, Jennifer actually introduced me to her with the statement that they have been friends for a year to the date. I congratulated the friendship.
It's hard for alot of us girls to make real friends in this town cause their is a lot of cliques. So I was excited to get another friend aswell.
Fast forward to new years eve 2023.
Jennifer calls me at 3 am sobbing. Telling me she is walking home from the event she went to with Clarissa. I tell her to call her boyfriend (they had just started dating that's why she didn't call him first) and come to my house, my boyfriend is friends with hers. 
So they come to my house. 
The boys go upstairs and we are talking in my room. Well first I'm trying to calm her down cause she was crying so much. She tells me the whole story Clarissa ditched her the whole night. Then she went to do the new years eve countdown with her and they started fighting it ended up with girls slapping each other in the parking lot. 
Anyway I obviously don't like Clarissa very much at this point.
BTW I wasn't with them because I was working new years eve and got home around 2 am.
So then we calm down, go to bed. Next day.
I'm at work. It's around lunch time. Guess who walks in, Clarissa. Asks if she can talk to me, we go to the back
She proceeds to tell me that Jennifer started the fight with her, was hanging around other guys the whole night. And get this ripped her earing out her ear and ripped her earlobe. Shows me the earlobe. Very quickly all I saw was red skin not a hanging earlobe..?
Anyway. So what is happening now?
I message Jennifer a bit later telling her what Clarissa said. 
I think this was a day later or 2, Jennifer comes to me upset because she tried to go speak to Clarissa and her ex boyfriend was at the same house and came to her her and told her that Clarissa has been talking shit about Jennifer and me. 
Jennifer gets upset of course and tells me. She is more upset about what is being said about me than her which I did not understand. 

So then some time passes. Whenever me and Jennifer hang out she is saying we should post on our Instagram that we are together and having fun. Yes this was cruel to do to Clarissa but at this point I had only known her for 2 months and I had known Jennifer longer. So I went along with it. 

Fast forward April 2024. 
We found out Jennifer is Pregnant. Yay happy happy all that. 
May: Clarissa randomly shows up at Jennifer's house to 'apologise' she took her out for mocktails and food and gave her hair extensions. So Jennifer is feeling better about herself cause you know pregnancy things. Anyway how I found out about this in the first place was not because she told me but my boyfriend heard from hers that Clarissa showed up and my bf knows we weren't talking to her anymore. 
So I ask Jennifer what's happening explains that she actually feels pretty again and she's going to be a mom now so she must put such childish things behind her. 

So just like that Clarissa is back in our lives. 

I am a very loyal person and I do expect that back in my friendships. 

So I go and explain to Jennifer about 2 weeks later that I am actually hurt that she forgave Clarissa so quickly and if she is going to be back in Jennifer's life then that means I am not going to be her best friend anymore and she is mine and I haven't had a best friend that I connected with like her in a long time. 
She assured me that her and my friendship wouldn't change, we are like sisters and her friendship with Clarissa will never be the same again but that doesn't mean she didn't miss Clarissa. 

Anyway that's the back story for the context. 

It's now 2025 the baby is here, Jennifer's bf is working a stable job away from home to support and she doesn't have to work, their parents are very supportive aswell. 

I kinda forgot about Clarrissa. She's been abroad.

I haven't been seeing Jennifer as much cause obvi she's been busy with family.  Now here is the thing...
I have been telling Jennifer for the last 2 months that I am going to be on vacation at home for the month of July. So we can make plans. I am only going to be unavailable on Tuesdays. 

She only messages me on a Tuesday and then tells me she forgets I'm busy on Tuesdays. The last time we hung out was because I had to almost beg her to make time for me. It was last week.
She told me Clarissa is back in town can she join us I said yes cause people can't change if you don't let them try. 
I ended up going home and her and Clarissa went out for drinks. Jennifer's baby went with her. 
Last night she posts on her Instagram 'back with my baby"" with her and Clarissa. 
Here's the thing she's been posting of Clarissa every now and then throughout the last year ""missing you"" posts you know. But she doesn't post with me at all anymore, doesn't even wanna take pics with me. 
And it reminds me of ""we should take lots of pics for Instagram to show it's just you and me hanging out""
Feeling used.

My question is. 
If she is so busy with the baby then why can she go out drinking and take her along but not come over for a cup of coffee. 
I also am financially unstable right now so I also can't afford to go out. And I have been made to feel like I'm too poor to be someone's friend. 
But I have tried to make multiple plans that is free of cost. 
Am I just Jennifer's trauma dump buddy?
Should I stop caring so much about someone who clearly has stopped caring about me. 
Like I said it's hard for me to become so close to people and I'm feeling thrown away. ",2,1752897312.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

""Get the OR ready. Remove her womb. Make sure it’s done before she wakes.""



The pack healer went rigid with shock.



""Alpha... Remove her womb?!""



""Alpha—you don't have an heir! You do this, the pack will have no heir. The pack elders will never accept it!""



Cassian's voice was ice-cold, devoid of emotion.



""I don’t need an heir from Evelyn Carter. Annabelle delivered my heir yesterday. He will inherit everything. Evelyn’s womb is a threat.""



The healer's face crumpled with disbelief.



""But that boy will carry another man's name, call another man Alpha. After seven miscarriages, The chances of Luna carrying another are barely there.""



Cassian lit a cigarette, his voice bitter.



""Annabelle is my true mate, I’d do anything for her, I don't care some Moon Goddess pairing.""



""Alpha, but—""



""Enough."" He frowned. ""Do it.""



Just as Cassian got up to go, his phone buzzed. He hit speaker by mistake.



""Alpha, got the cash. Hell, after seven jobs, I could do this shit in my sleep. Next time, I’ll wear a vampire disguise—really carve up that Luna's belly—""



""No next time. Take your money and disappear from Moonvale.""



Footsteps approached from deeper inside.



I stumbled back to my room, barely making it to the bed before Cassian entered.



""Evelyn, you're up. When did you wake up?""



Sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to appear normal.



""Just woke up. You weren't here, so I thought I'd stretch my legs.""



His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face.



My wolf whimpered with terror. Just when I thought he'd caught me, he scooped me up and settled me back on the bed.



""Baby, you scared the hell out of me. We already lost our pup—I can't handle losing you too.""



He dared to mention our pup.



Thinking of all the puppies he'd murdered, I pressed a hand to my chest as grief threatened to overwhelm me.



Those accidents, the attacks, the fall—all of it orchestrated by my own mate.



""The heal needs to do a follow-up procedure. Just to make sure everything's healing properly.""



""I know losing the baby hurts, but we'll try again. We'll have the most beautiful pup—strong like their Alpha, gentle like their mother.""



Cassian handed me a vial of potion. In the brief moment he turned away, I saw a thick, dark liquid shimmer as something else mixed in and vanished.



He pulled me close, his expression soft with false concern.



But I could see through the mask now. Every gentle touch was a lie.



""Do I really need to drink this? I'm not very thirsty...""



Cassian, you've slaughtered seven of my children. Now you want to steal my very ability to be a mother?



He didn't even pause, stroking my hair with that practiced tenderness.



""Come on, don't be difficult. You need your strength to heal. You want your Alpha to worry himself sick?""



""Let me help you with that.""



He pressed the glass to my lips, his grip firm enough that refusal wasn't an option.



I closed my eyes, each swallow feeling like liquid fire burning down my throat.



As the drugs took hold, I saw the healer slip into the room through my blurring vision.



""Begin immediately. And...""



Cassian's voice dropped to barely a whisper.



""Make sure she can’t walk again.""



Chapter 2



""Alpha, is this really necessary? Isn’t that… a little too cruel?""



""Do it!""



I knew Cassian was always calculating and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me awake early would push him to such cruelty.



My puppy, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to walk—he was taking everything.



Cassian, is this how you treat the mate the Moon Goddess chose for you?



My wolf howled inside me, wild and silent with fury.



I screamed silently in despair, struggling to sit up, but the darkness pulled me deeper.



As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the healer's voice through the haze:



""Alpha, her womb has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""



Cassian's voice was filled with satisfaction. ""Good. Perfect.""



When I fully awakened, tears were falling onto my hands—his tears, so convincingly real.



""Evelyn, the healer says infection damaged your womb. You'll never be able to have children.""



I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.



Nothing. No sensation at all.



I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded:



""Cassian, what did you do to my legs?""



Tears streamed down his face, his voice breaking with practiced grief.



""There were complications with the anesthesia. You're paralyzed from the waist down.""



""Don't be scared, baby... no matter what happens, I'll never leave you. I'll always love you.""



I'd never realized what a gifted actor my mate was.



He dismissed the nurses, personally feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even tending to the post-surgical bleeding himself.



He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.



""You've suffered so much for our pack. I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""



I studied his exhausted face, then looked away coldly.



""You should rest if you're tired.""



""I'll stay right here with you. Just call if you need anything.""



Once he was asleep, I reached for his second phone.



I'd always known about Cassian's other device—his ""work phone""—but had never thought to check it.



The password worked on the first try.



Annabelle's birthday.



The lock screen showed their wedding photo.



A wedding photo... He'd married her in secret. The white dress seared my eyes.



With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. He called her ""baby"" in every text.



Endless conversations that grew more horrifying with each scroll.



Every business trip had been a lie—excuses to be with her.



All those times I'd been hurt that he never came to my doctor appointments.



When physicians asked about the Alpha, I'd smile awkwardly and say he was busy with Alpha duties.



His standard response was always the same:



""I’ve been tied up with pack affairs. Check-ups aren't a big deal—I'd just be in the way. You can handle routine things yourself.""



But he'd attended every single one of Annabelle's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy, he never missed one.



He wrote about how excited he was for their child, calling them the most precious thing in his world.



Scrolling further, my heart shattered completely.



Every time I got pregnant, they planned how to kill my child.



Even the car accident from a year ago—Annabelle had been behind the wheel.



She'd said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone. Cassian had eagerly agreed.



His only instruction: ""Try not to kill her outright.""



They discussed hurting me and murdering my children as casually as commenting on the weather.



My nails dug into my palms until blood dripped between my fingers.



The photo album contained thousands of pictures—all of Annabelle. Candid shots, selfies together, morning scenes, walks, intimate dinners where he'd prepared special meals for her pregnancy...



There were 99+ videos. I switched to that section and felt ice water flood my veins.



Countless recordings of their intimate moments, like they were documenting every encounter.



Even role-playing scenarios that made my stomach turn.



I pressed my hand to my mouth, fighting nausea.



But worse were six videos labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way to ""Sixth.""



Realizing what they contained, bile rose in my throat as blood filled my mouth.



Chapter 3



I bit down hard on my lip and opened the sixth video.



Cassian and Annabelle were laughing together.



In front of them lay...my unboren puppy.



The blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My wolf howled in agony, the pain causing my stomach to cramp violently.



I couldn't hold back anymore, leaning over the bed rail as dry heaves wracked my body.



I didn't sleep that night, my wolf pacing restlessly in my mind as tears soaked through my hospital gown.



The next morning, Cassian brought me breakfast as usual—an elaborate spread he'd personally selected.



Pancakes, fresh fruit, coffee, pastries...



I'd once thought this was his way of showing love. Now I knew it was just thoughtless guilt, buying his way out of actually caring.



Remembering the videos, I dry heaved again.



Seeing my distress, Cassian's expression filled with concern:



""Still feeling sick? Damn it, this is all my fault. I hate seeing my mate like this.""



""I'm fine. I want to go home.""



Something flickered across Cassian's face—a moment of tension.



""You just lost another pup. My mother isn't... handling it well. If you go back to the pack house now, you'll just walk into a shitstorm. Maybe we should wait until things cool down.""



I said nothing, but his expression told me everything I needed to know.



That afternoon, while he was gone, I packed my things and wheeled myself to the pack house.



I rolled through the front door to find Annabelle curled up in Cassian's lap, both of them cooing over a baby whose scent carried unmistakable traces of Graves bloodline.



Margaret emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of bone broth, personally feeding Annabelle spoonful by spoonful.



The three of them looked like the perfect family unit.



The moment Margaret caught my scent, her eyes flashed with her wolf's displeasure.



""Well, well. Look what crawled back to the den. You've got some nerve showing your face here after what you've done.""



""My Alpha son treats you like a precious mate, and this is how you repay him? Another dead heir. You're cursed, and you're bringing that curse into our pack!""



""Annabelle is the one deserves to be Luna of the Moonvale Pack. Get out of my territory—you're poison to this pack.""



Annabelle followed Margaret's gaze to me, her eyes glittering with the triumph:



""Luna Margaret, don't be so harsh. What if Evelyn gets upset and starts spreading lies about Alpha and me to the other packs?""



""Let her try. No pack leader gives a damn what a barren she-wolf has to say.""



I knew Margaret had always despised me. She thought I was too headstrong for an Alpha's mate, too independent—that I'd challenge her son's authority instead of submitting properly.



Annabelle was everything she wanted: beautiful, submissive, making Cassian the center of her universe like a proper Luna should.



She'd only wanted Annabelle as her son's mate, but then Annabelle married into another pack, and I'd given up everything to be the perfect Alpha's mate.



Margaret had reluctantly accepted me into the pack.



But years of failed pregnancies had pushed her resentment to the breaking point.



Now that Annabelle was back—with Cassian's heir—Margaret felt free to unleash every bit of venom she'd been storing.



If only she knew that every one of those lost pups had been orchestrated by her beloved Alpha.



Every grandchild she'd mourned had been murdered by the woman she was now treating like precious pack treasure.



In the past, Cassian would have used his Alpha command to intervene. Now he sat there holding Annabelle's child, acting like he couldn't hear a word.



Annabelle nestled deeper into his arms:



""Cassian, you're paying more attention to the pup than to me. Your wolf is making mine jealous.""



Cassian's expression melted with adoration as he nuzzled her neck, scenting her:



""You know you're my true mate. But look what I have for you.""



I followed Annabelle's delighted gaze to a document on the coffee table: ""Pack Territory Transfer Agreement.""



""Oh my God, Cassian! You're giving me pack lands?""



She kissed the corner of his mouth, shooting me a triumphant look over his shoulder.



I smiled back coldly, my wolf finally going still in my mind.



Enjoy it while you can.



Soon enough, you and your precious Alpha will be crawling back to me, begging.

I’m envisioning something like if Cava, Sweetgreen, and Nekter had a baby—think juices, coffee, açai bowls, and build-your-own bowls or plates with clean, whole ingredients.

I grew up in the restaurant industry—my dad owned pizza shops and breakfast spots and was a chef himself. I’ve owned a pizza shop too, but it was more of a continuation of an existing business with only minor tweaks to the menu. This is the first time I’m building something entirely from scratch, and I’m feeling excited but also looking for guidance.

I’m considering posting locally to find a chef or consultant to help build out the menu, but before I do that, I wanted to ask this community:
How did you approach menu development when starting your own place?
Would you hire someone? Partner with a chef? Or test recipes yourself?

Open to all suggestions and stories—thanks in advance!

1m3mikw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1m3mikw/my_boss_makes_me_give_half_of_my_tips_to_my/,My boss makes me give half of my tips to my manager,"TL;DR my boss makes me give my manager half of my tips when i spend about 95% of the day behind the bar myself and do all of the actual hard work/customer service to actually earn them. 

i work at a VERY small business coffee shop in Florida and have been since october, shortly after i moved here. there are 3 employees total, including myself..technically 2 employees plus one “manager” (definitely seems to be a self appointed role that my boss just went with because he realized running a business takes more than a couple online courses and he was in way over his head). since it is so small scale, we only ever have 2 baristas working each day. MAXIMUM. there are days when i have to open (get there at 7:00, open the shop at 7:30) and stay until close (shop closes at 3:00 and i’m usually out by 3:30-4:15 depending on how much pre close i was able to do and whether it is our deep clean day or not). all by myself. without a break mind you because my boss doesn’t think it’s needed for a shift that is “only 8-9 hours”. yeah dude easy for you to say. you sit on a comfy chair in your office where the air conditioning actually works while i am ON MY FEET THE WHOLE TIME ON CONCRETE FLOORS in a coffee shop with an open concept kitchen that makes it get so hot in the building.) i don’t always mind working these shifts alone however because i get to keep 100% of the tips.

with that being said, i often work shifts with just my manager. at the shop, we sell food made in house. this is because my boss wants to stand out from other coffee shops and only serve great quality. on the days my manager works with me, she preps food in the kitchen our ENTIRE shift. she used to not be there open to close with me, but, because she was only barely finishing the prep she needed to get done for the day, she extended her hours. now she is there with me open to close and somehow there are weeks she doesn’t get the prep done (even though she said all she needed was an extra hour or two and she gave that to herself). she takes lots of short breaks throughout the day. while i am behind the bar, doing all of the opening duties, roughly 95% of closing duties, and all of the daily duties meant to be split evenly between the scheduled baristas. this is not hyperbole, this is just simply the unfortunate reality. 
now this is where my issue arises. my boss INSISTS i split *my* hard earned tips. in half. with my manager. who is in the kitchen prepping food while i’m in the coffee shop taking all of the orders, making all of the drinks, heating up all of the food. literally all of the daily coffee shop operations, by myself. there are days my “manager” doesn’t even end up prepping all the food we need for that weeks timeframe because she was too busy sitting in the office talking to my boss or sitting in the lobby on the laptop, taking breaks, something i am not allowed to do. on these days still i am expected to split my tips in half because she is clocked in and would *technically* be there to help if i absolutely needed it. by the way, i keep saying manager in quotes because this is her current official position title however she: does not act like a manager, very often SERIOUSLY messes up basic managerial tasks that cost the business lots of money (that isn’t there in the first place) and in turn, make my life as an employee more difficult, and makes zero effort to not be the the type manager that does absolutely nothing and somehow makes EVERYTHING the employee’s responsibility simply because she gets to pull the “i’m your superior” card. she fits the awful manager stereotype that you are thinking of in your head right now. 
with all of this being said, i have brought up my concerns with having to split my tips in half with someone who doesn’t help me earn them at all, is my manager, and makes dollars more an hour than me. his response is always the same extremely defensive excuse of “well without her we wouldn’t have the food prepped to sell to the customers” which yes true, BUT, in what world do chefs, let alone prep chefs at restaurants get to keep FIFTY PERCENT of the tips the servers made just because they made the food they served? i have worked in many restaurants and this has NEVER been the case at any of them. if anything, the servers willingly give the chefs a few dollars every night because they are kind, work hard, and do deserve the thank you gesture for making the shift run smoothly. it is not my fault my boss does not have the money in the business to pay an actual prep chef wage. mind you i was NOT informed nor aware of this upon my interview or starting to work here..just mentioning this before anyone asks why i even took the job in the first place if i knew this was the case. when i have tried to bring this up to him in hopes to maybe make him realize it’s not right, he never listens and always says the same thing. 
i just really don’t think it’s fair to have to work 8.5-9 hours consistently with no break while also, doing all the hard work to actually earn these tips, spend almost the entire day, if not the entire day, behind the bar, by myself and then be forced to split my tips with my manager.
maybe i am overthinking this and i can’t tell if i am actually overreacting over this specific scenario, but my work environment has not been healthy for a while. and has been causing me to have frequent panic attacks nearly every day. my only actual coworker sucks, my “manager” SUCKS, and my boss SUCKKKKKKSSSSSS. i am usually never one to not stick out a job. the last time i ACTUALLY quit a job because i didn’t want to be there any longer was in 2020. i have moved a couple times since then so that has been the reason i ended up quitting. otherwise i would have stayed at my previous jobs longer because usually i can tough out a couple crappy procedural things if it means i don’t have to go through the whole new job process. it is just par for the course in the food and beverage industry. but this place is so beyond awful, i am truly not exaggerating that. and this is only one of many things i have an issue with working here. like this genuinely only barely scratches the surface.
i’m planning on quitting literally tomorrow, maybe the next day. i’m really just posting because i NEED to rant about this, plus who knows, my judgement could be so clouded because my mental health has been declining (mainly because of work lol) and i am so burnt out i can’t think straight lately. 

plus i am curious to know the legality behind having to give my manager half of my tips that I earned MYSELF while she either preps food in the kitchen or sits on her butt all day long, not helping me (unless i am so swamped i can’t handle it alone as mentioned). i have only lived in Florida for like 10 months, i am still working on familiarizing myself with all of the labor laws here.",3,1752896963.0,WorkAdvice,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tampa Bay Rays vs. Baltimore Orioles: A Tale of Two Batting Averages (and One Very Confused Starter)**

The Tampa Bay Rays, fresh off an 11-1 thrashing of the Orioles that made Baltimore’s offense look like a group of kindergarteners playing baseball with a watermelon, now aim to snap their four-game losing streak. The Orioles, meanwhile, are here to do what they do best: underperform against a team with a .258 batting average (MLB’s best) while somehow managing to keep fans entertained with their brand of “wait, *that* was a hit?” baseball.

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
The Rays are -127 favorites, which translates to a 55.9% implied probability of winning. For context, that’s about the same chance of correctly guessing someone’s birthday in one try if they’re *very* bad at keeping secrets. The Orioles, at +205, have a 32.8% chance—roughly the odds of flipping a coin and it landing on its edge. Statistically, this is a mismatch in the making.

The Rays lead MLB in batting average (.258) and rank ninth in runs scored, while the Orioles trail in both categories (.239 BA, 22nd in runs). Tampa’s offense is a well-oiled espresso machine; Baltimore’s is a leaky faucet that occasionally sputters a drop of coffee. Throw in Chandler Simpson’s 17-game hitting streak (a stat so absurd it should come with a warning label) and the Rays’ 58% win rate as favorites, and you’ve got a team that’s statistically *meant* to dominate this matchup.

**News from the Dugout: Injuries, Streaks, and Morton’s Midlife Crisis**  
The Rays are riding high on the back of Junior Caminero, who homered twice (including a 439-foot moonshot that probably woke up astronauts), and Yandy Díaz, who hit a grand slam so casually it looked like he was just tapping in. Zack Littell, the starting pitcher, has the kind of ERA that makes accountants blush, and his cu

My psychiatrist believes I use anxiety to combat adhd since childhood.

I’ve been on dex and vyvanse 40mg since then, plus Pristiq 50mg, and started ocd sessions. I definitely focus more and get more done on meds while working from homem around the house etc. but, I’m looking back and wondering how my life has improved since then, if at all.

\-im annoyed I have to time my medication so decaf coffee doesn’t impact it , have to eat more protein, etc etc

\-I’m having to spend money on repeat psychiatry, more meds, more ocd sessions

\-I have a hobby pilot license, but this rules out me being able to fly again, kind of kills that basically. (although flying could also be very stressful, it was also exhilarating )

\-i still don’t really know if I have adhd, last week I skipped a day of meds and felt fine.

just feels like I’ve added more chores and things to do.   
maybe I should have just not bothered with this diagnosis, tried other methods to manage and kept my flying dreams alive? or maybe the meds need adjustment? Sorry for the whinge, but any advice or suggestions would be really appreciated. Thanks",2,1752896750.0,ausadhd,1,1.0,False

1m3me39,https://youtu.be/Jc7muprgmGE,3 Very Scary TRUE Postal Worker Horror Stories,"# ""Return to Sender"":

I’ve been a postal worker in this small town for twelve years. My route takes me through quiet streets lined with old houses, where I deliver letters and packages to folks I’ve come to know well. There’s a rhythm to it: the weight of my mailbag, the clink of mailbox lids, the occasional chat with a neighbor. I’ve always felt safe, like I belonged. But that changed a few months ago, and now every step feels like I’m being hunted.

It started with little things. Packages I’d delivered would vanish from porches by the time I looped back around. At first, I thought people were just quick to grab them. Then I noticed letters in mailboxes, ripped open, their contents missing—bills, birthday cards, even junk mail. I chalked it up to raccoons or bored teenagers. I mentioned it to my supervisor, Tom, at the post office. He was sorting mail behind the counter, barely looking up. “Probably just kids,” he said. “Report it if it keeps happening, but don’t worry too much.”

I tried not to, but it got worse. One morning, I found a note in a mailbox on Elm Street, tucked between a catalog and a utility bill. It was addressed to me in sharp, jagged handwriting: “I see you every day.” My stomach twisted, but I laughed it off, thinking it was a prank. I stuffed the note in my pocket and kept going. The next day, another note appeared in a different mailbox: “You can’t hide from me.” My hands shook as I read it. This wasn’t a kid’s joke. Someone was watching me.

By the third note, I was scared. It was in a mailbox on Pine Road, and it read, “I know where you live.” My house is miles from my route, a small place on the edge of town. How could anyone know that? I showed the note to Tom that afternoon. He leaned back in his creaky chair, scratching his graying beard. “Sounds like someone’s trying to spook you,” he said. “Maybe a coworker pulling a prank. Keep me posted, but don’t let it mess with your head.”

His words didn’t help. Every morning, I’d start my route scanning the streets, my heart pounding. I noticed a car—a dark gray sedan with tinted windows—parked at the corner of Maple and Oak. It was there every day, sometimes moving to a different spot but always nearby. If I walked toward it, the engine would rev, and it’d peel out before I could see the driver. I tried to catch the license plate, but it was always too far or too blurry.

One afternoon, I was delivering to Mrs. Clara, an older woman who lives in a tidy yellow house. She was watering her roses when I handed her a stack of mail. She noticed my hands trembling. “You okay, dear?” she asked, her voice soft but concerned.

I hesitated, then pulled the latest note from my bag. “Someone’s leaving these,” I said, showing her the one about my house. Her eyes narrowed as she read it.

“This is no joke,” she said, setting her watering can down. “You need to tell the police. Now.”

“I don’t want to make a big deal out of it,” I said, my voice quieter than I meant. “What if it’s nothing?”

She shook her head, her silver curls bouncing. “This is serious. Someone’s targeting you. Promise me you’ll be careful.”

I nodded, but I didn’t go to the police. I wanted to believe it was nothing, that I could handle it. That was my first mistake.

The next week, I was delivering to the old Jenkins house, a crumbling place that’s been empty since the owner passed away. As I slid a flyer into the rusted mailbox, I saw a shadow move behind the house—a man in a dark hoodie, ducking out of sight. My pulse spiked. Was that him? The one leaving the notes? I should’ve walked away, but my feet moved before my brain caught up. I crept around the house, my hand on the pepper spray in my bag. “Hello?” I called, my voice shaky. “Who’s there?”

No answer, just the crunch of leaves as someone ran into the woods behind the property. I followed, my heart hammering, the trees closing in around me. The woods were thick, branches snagging at my uniform. I lost the figure in the shadows, but then I tripped over something—a small campsite hidden in a clearing. There was a worn tent, a sleeping bag, and a pile of empty food cans. On a rotting log sat a notebook.

I picked it up, my hands trembling so bad I almost dropped it. Inside were pages of sketches—drawings of me. Me walking my route, me sorting mail at the truck, me sitting on the park bench where I take my break. There were notes, too, in that same jagged handwriting: “8:45 AM—Clara’s house.” “10:15 AM—Coffee shop.” “11:30 AM—Bench by the library.” My knees buckled. This wasn’t a prank. Someone was tracking my every move.

I dropped the notebook and ran back to my truck, my breath coming in gasps. I drove straight to the police station, the notebook clutched in my hands. The officer, a guy named Jenkins, took one look at it and frowned. “This is disturbing,” he said, flipping through the pages. “We’ll look into it. Stay vigilant, and call us if you see anything else.”

For a few days, things were quiet. No notes, no sedan. I started to hope it was over. Then, one night, I woke to a crash downstairs. Glass shattering. My heart leapt into my throat as I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. “Someone’s in my house,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. The operator told me to stay calm, but I could hear footsteps—slow, heavy, deliberate—coming up the stairs.

I slipped into my bedroom closet, pulling the door shut as quietly as I could. I pressed myself against the wall, my phone shaking in my hand. The bedroom door creaked open. A shadow moved across the floor, stretching long and thin in the moonlight. The footsteps stopped right outside the closet. My breath caught, my body frozen. The closet door started to open, inch by inch.

Then I saw him—the man in the hoodie. His face was half-hidden, but his eyes gleamed in the dark, locked on the crack in the door. He held a knife, its blade glinting faintly. “I told you I’d find you,” he whispered, his voice low and cold, like ice sliding down my spine.

Before he could open the door fully, sirens blared outside. He froze, then bolted, his footsteps pounding down the stairs. The police burst in moments later, flashlights sweeping the house. They found a broken kitchen window and muddy footprints leading out the back door, but he was gone. They promised to patrol my street, but it didn’t feel like enough.

I couldn’t sleep after that. Every creak in the house, every shadow outside, made my heart race. I started carrying a flashlight and checking every lock twice. Weeks passed, and the notes stopped. The sedan disappeared. I tried to tell myself it was over, that he’d moved on.

Then, last Tuesday, I came home from my shift to find my front door ajar—just a crack, but enough to make my stomach drop. I pushed it open, my hands shaking. Inside, my house was destroyed. Couch cushions were slashed, their stuffing spilling out like snow. Drawers were yanked open, their contents scattered across the floor. My family photos, the ones on the living room wall, were smashed, glass glittering on the carpet. In the kitchen, on my table, sat a single sheet of paper. That jagged handwriting stared back at me: “I’m still here. I’ll always be here.”

Now, every night, I hear things. Footsteps crunching outside my window. Whispers in the dark, too soft to make out. Shadows moving just beyond the glow of my porch light. I’ve installed cameras, bolted every door, even bought a baseball bat to keep by my bed. But it doesn’t matter. I check the camera footage every morning, and sometimes I see him—a figure in a hoodie, standing at the edge of my yard, staring at the house. The police can’t find him. They say he’s careful, leaving no prints, no trace.

I don’t know who he is or why he’s doing this. I don’t know how long I can keep living like this, jumping at every sound, checking every shadow. All I know is he’s out there, watching, waiting. And I’m terrified he’s never going to stop.





# ""Fourteen Fountains"":

I woke up early on August 20, 1986, careful not to disturb my wife, Lois, who was still asleep in our small house in Edmond, Oklahoma. The quiet of the morning wrapped around me like a blanket as I pulled on my postal uniform, the familiar blue shirt and pants still crisp from ironing. In the kitchen, I poured coffee into my favorite mug, the one with a faded Oklahoma Sooners logo, and grabbed a piece of toast. Lois stirred as I leaned down to kiss her forehead. “Have a good day, honey,” she murmured, her voice thick with sleep. “See you tonight,” I said, grabbing my keys. Those words felt so ordinary, but they’d soon haunt me.

The drive to the post office was uneventful, the streets of Edmond quiet, with only a few early risers jogging or walking their dogs. I pulled into the employee lot behind the post office, the gravel crunching under my tires. As I walked toward the back entrance, I spotted Jerry, a rural carrier with a graying mustache, unloading his truck. “Morning, Gene,” he called, flashing a grin. “Ready for another day?” I nodded, forcing a smile. “Always, Jerry. You got plans for the weekend?” He told me about taking his family to Lake Hefner for a picnic, his eyes lighting up as he described his daughter’s love for fishing. I mentioned catching the Sooners game on TV, maybe grilling some burgers. It was the kind of easy chatter that made the job feel like home.

Inside, the post office buzzed with its usual rhythm. The air smelled of ink and paper, mixed with the faint metallic tang of sorting machines. Clerks shuffled through stacks of letters, their hands moving like clockwork. Carriers checked their routes, double-checking addresses. I settled at my station near the sorting area, a cluttered desk piled with envelopes and rubber bands. Patti, a clerk with a quick laugh, was already there, telling me about her daughter’s soccer game. “She scored twice last night,” she said, her face glowing with pride. “You should’ve seen her out there, dodging those defenders like a pro.” I grinned, picturing it. “She’s gonna be a star,” I said, tossing a bundle of mail into a bin.

Around 7 a.m., a loud bang jolted me from my work. I froze, thinking a door had slammed or maybe a pallet had tipped over in the loading dock. Another bang followed, sharper, louder. Then another. My stomach twisted. Something was wrong. A scream ripped through the air: “He’s got a gun! Run!” My heart slammed against my ribs. I whipped around and saw Patrick Sherrill, a part-time carrier, standing in the middle of the room. He held a pistol in each hand, his face twisted into something unrecognizable—eyes cold, mouth set in a grim line. He fired again, the sound so loud it felt like it punched through my skull.

Chaos exploded. People screamed, diving under desks, scrambling for exits. I grabbed Patti’s arm, yanking her down behind our desk. “Stay down!” I hissed, my voice shaking. The desk was flimsy, just wood and metal, but it was all we had. I peeked out, my breath catching. Judy, a clerk who always brought donuts on Fridays, crumpled to the floor, blood blooming across her chest. My mind reeled. This wasn’t happening. It couldn’t be.

Sherrill moved like a predator, deliberate and unhurried, his boots thudding against the tile floor. Each gunshot was a hammer to my nerves. I smelled gunpowder, sharp and bitter, mixing with the coppery scent of blood. “We need to get out,” I whispered to Patti, my voice barely audible over the screams. I turned to her, but her head was slumped, her eyes wide and empty. A bullet had found her, leaving a red stain on her blouse. My throat tightened, tears burning my eyes, but there was no time to grieve.

I had to move. The back door was closest, but Sherrill was near it, his shadow looming as he fired again. I crawled toward the side exit instead, my hands slipping on the slick floor. My knees ached, my palms stung, but fear drove me forward. Another scream cut through the air, high and desperate. I glanced back and saw Bill, a clerk with a knack for bad puns, sprint past a row of mailboxes. He was fast, but not fast enough. A gunshot cracked, and he fell, his body hitting the ground with a sickening thud.

My heart pounded so hard I thought it would burst. I kept crawling, my breath ragged, the pain in my chest growing with every inch. Then, a searing agony tore through my back, like someone had driven a hot poker into my spine. I gasped, collapsing, my face pressed against the cold floor. Blood soaked my shirt, warm and sticky. I’d been shot. The world blurred, sounds muffled—screams, gunshots, the clatter of overturned chairs.

Sherrill’s shadow fell over me. I looked up, my vision swimming, and saw him standing there, his gun pointed at my head. His eyes were empty, like he wasn’t even human anymore. I thought of Lois, our kids, the life we’d built. I braced for the end, my eyes squeezing shut. But then a voice broke through: “Pat, no! Stop!” It was Tom, a supervisor with a calm demeanor, standing with his hands raised. “You don’t have to do this,” he pleaded, his voice steady despite the terror. Sherrill paused, his gun wavering. Then, without a word, he turned and fired. Tom dropped, blood pooling beneath him.

That moment saved me. I dragged myself toward the side door, every movement agony. My hands left bloody streaks on the floor. The exit was so close, just a few feet away. I pushed through the pain, my vision darkening at the edges. I didn’t dare look back. Another gunshot rang out, then another, each one a reminder that Sherrill was still there, still hunting.

I reached the door, shoving it open with my shoulder. I tumbled into the parking lot, the air hitting my face like a slap. I gasped, clutching my side, blood dripping onto the asphalt. “Gene!” a voice shouted. It was John, a carrier who’d worked there longer than me. He and Steve, another carrier, were crouched behind a delivery van. “You’re hit!” John said, his face pale as he ran to me. They grabbed my arms, dragging me behind the van as sirens wailed in the distance. “Hang on, man,” Steve said, his voice tight. “Help’s coming.”

An ambulance screeched into the lot, its lights flashing. Paramedics rushed over, their faces grim as they lifted me onto a stretcher. As they loaded me in, more gunshots echoed from inside the post office, each one making me flinch. The doors of the ambulance slammed shut, and we sped away, the world fading into a haze of pain and fear.

At the hospital, doctors moved fast. They said the bullet had torn through my kidney and lodged in my stomach. Surgery was a blur of bright lights and masked faces. They got the bullet out, stitched me up, told me I was lucky to be alive. But I didn’t feel lucky. Not when I learned 14 of my coworkers were gone—Patti, Judy, Tom, Bill, and so many others. Sherrill had turned the gun on himself after the rampage, leaving behind a slaughter that lasted less than 15 minutes but changed everything.

The weeks that followed were a fog. My body healed slowly, the scar on my back a constant reminder. But the real pain was in my mind. Nightmares woke me up every night—Sherrill’s face, the sound of gunshots, Patti’s lifeless eyes. I’d wake up shaking, Lois holding me, whispering, “It’s okay, you’re safe.” But I didn’t feel safe. I’d jump at loud noises—a car backfiring, a door slamming. The smell of ink or the sight of a mailbox would send my heart racing.

I tried going back to work a few months later. The post office had been cleaned, repainted, but it was still a graveyard. Every corner held a memory of that day—the spot where Judy fell, the desk where Patti died. I’d freeze mid-task, my hands trembling, seeing Sherrill’s shadow in every doorway. I lasted a week before I quit, retiring early. I couldn’t do it anymore.

Lois pushed me to see a therapist, a kind woman with a soft voice who listened as I poured out the fear and guilt. Why did I survive when so many didn’t? The therapy helped, but it didn’t erase the scars. I started visiting the Yellow Ribbon Memorial, a quiet spot in Edmond with a statue and 14 fountains, one for each life lost. Standing there, I’d trace the names etched in stone, remembering Judy’s donuts, Patti’s laugh, Tom’s courage. It hurt, but it also reminded me of the good—the coworkers who risked their lives to help, like John and Steve dragging me to safety.

Years later, in 2025, I’m still here, but that day is never far away. A loud noise, a certain smell, a news story about a shooting—it all brings me back to that morning. The fear, the blood, the loss—it’s carved into me, as permanent as the scar on my back. But I hold onto the moments of bravery, the people who stood up in the face of horror. It’s what keeps me going, even when the nightmares come.





# ""Dead Letters"":

I’ve been a postal worker for fifteen years, and I’ve always loved my job. There’s something special about delivering letters and packages, connecting people across distances. But after what happened last night, I’m not sure I can keep doing this. Some places hold onto their darkness, and this post office is one of them.

It all started a year ago when Carl Johnson, one of our carriers, was arrested for murdering his coworker, Lisa. They found her body in the alley behind the post office, stabbed multiple times. Carl claimed it was self-defense, that Lisa had attacked him first, but no one believed him. He was sentenced to life in prison. What made it worse was that, due to some union technicality, Carl was still considered an employee, on paid leave while serving his sentence. It didn’t sit right with any of us, but that’s how it was.

The post office hasn’t been the same since. The building itself is old, built in the early 1900s, with high ceilings, creaky wooden floors, and long, dimly lit hallways. After Lisa’s death, a heavy tension settled over the place. Coworkers whispered about strange noises—doors slamming when no one was around, faint voices echoing in empty rooms. I never believed in ghosts, but even I noticed the air felt heavier, like the building was holding its breath.

Last night, I was working the late shift, sorting mail in the basement. It was around 2 AM, and I was the only one left. The sorting room is a cavernous space, filled with the hum of machines and the rustle of paper. The fluorescent lights buzz overhead, casting harsh shadows. I was in the middle of sorting a stack of letters when I heard a door slam shut somewhere above me. The sound was sharp, deliberate, not like the usual creaks of the old building.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice echoing in the empty room. No answer. I tried to focus on my work, thinking it was just the wind or a loose door. But then I heard it again—a woman’s voice, soft but clear, saying, “Help me.” It came from the direction of the locker room upstairs.

My heart started pounding. I grabbed my flashlight, my hands already shaking, and headed toward the stairs. The hallway to the locker room felt longer than usual, the shadows stretching out like fingers. When I pushed open the locker room door, the fluorescent lights flickered, casting an eerie glow. That’s when I saw it—Lisa’s locker was open. Inside was a photograph of her and Carl, smiling together. It was strange because I thought all her things had been cleared out after her death.

“Who’s there?” I shouted, shining my flashlight around the room. No one answered, but I heard footsteps—heavy, deliberate—coming from the hallway behind me. I spun around, but the corridor was empty. My stomach churned. “This is ridiculous,” I muttered, trying to calm myself. “It’s just an old building.”

But then I heard the voice again, closer this time. “Help me.” It was coming from inside the locker room. I backed away, my flashlight beam darting across the rows of lockers. That’s when I noticed a package on the floor, addressed to Carl Johnson. My blood ran cold. Why was there a package for him here? He was in prison.

I picked it up, and that’s when I saw it—a small, red stain on the corner of the package. It looked like blood. My hands trembled as I set it down. I needed to call someone. I pulled out my phone, but there was no signal. The building’s old wiring often caused dead zones, but this felt too convenient. I tried the landline on the supervisor’s desk, but it was dead, just a faint buzz on the line.

The intercom crackled to life, making me jump. “You can’t escape,” a voice said, deep and menacing. It sounded just like Carl’s voice. My knees went weak. “This isn’t happening,” I whispered. “It’s a prank. It has to be.”

But then, there was a knock on the sorting room door. Soft at first, then louder. “Let me in,” the voice said again. I backed away, my heart hammering in my chest. The knocking grew more insistent, each thud echoing like a drum. “Go away!” I shouted, but it didn’t stop.

I grabbed a heavy stapler from the desk, holding it like a weapon, and hid behind the sorting machine. The knocking stopped abruptly, leaving a deafening silence. I waited, barely breathing, listening for any sound. After what felt like forever, I crept toward the door and pressed my ear against it. Nothing.

Cautiously, I unlocked the door and peeked out. The hallway was empty, the fluorescent lights buzzing faintly. I let out a shaky breath and decided to get out of there. I grabbed my coat and headed for the back exit, my footsteps echoing in the quiet.

As I stepped outside, I froze. There, by the dumpster at the edge of the parking lot, was a figure in a postal uniform. He turned slowly, and even from a distance, I could see his face. It looked like Carl. My breath caught in my throat. I blinked, and he was gone, like he’d never been there.

I ran to my car, locked the doors, and drove away as fast as I could, my hands shaking on the wheel. I kept glancing in the rearview mirror, half-expecting to see him standing there again.

The next morning, I went to work early and told my coworker, Jenny, everything. She’s been here longer than me and knows all the stories. “You’re just stressed,” she said, stirring her coffee in the break room. “This place gets to people, especially after what happened with Lisa.”

“But I heard his voice, Jenny,” I said, my voice shaking. “And I saw him.”

She frowned, setting her mug down. “Carl’s in prison. You know that. Maybe someone’s playing a prank. New guys sometimes do that to mess with people.”

“A prank?” I asked, incredulous. “With a bloody package and his voice on the intercom?”

Jenny shrugged, but I could see the unease in her eyes. “Look, just talk to the supervisor. He’ll check the security footage.”

I did just that. I went to my supervisor, Tom, and explained everything. He listened quietly, then said, “I’ll check the tapes, but you know this building’s old. It makes noises, and stress can make you see things.”

Later that day, Tom called me into his office. “I checked the footage,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “There’s nothing. No one else in the building, no doors slamming, no one by the dumpster. Just you.”

“But I heard things,” I insisted. “I saw things.”

He sighed. “Maybe you need some time off. Stress can do funny things to the mind.”

I left his office feeling more unsettled than ever. That night, as I was leaving work, I found a letter on my windshield. It was addressed to Carl, from Lisa’s family, demanding answers about her death. Someone had written on the back in red ink: “Deliver it.” I don’t know how it got there, but I didn’t touch it. I left it on the ground and drove away.

The next night, I was back on the late shift, against my better judgment. I kept my head down, sorting mail, trying to ignore the creeping dread. But then I heard it again—the woman’s voice, louder this time. “Help me, please.” It was coming from the locker room.

I didn’t investigate this time. I grabbed my things and left, locking the door behind me. As I walked to my car, I saw him again—Carl, standing on the side of the road, staring at me. He didn’t move, didn’t speak, just watched.

I got into my car and sped away, my heart racing. I know it’s impossible—Carl’s in prison. But I saw him. I heard him. And I can’t shake the feeling that Lisa’s death left something behind, something that’s still here, watching me.

I called in sick today, and I’m thinking about quitting. Some jobs aren’t worth the risk, and some places are better left alone.",1,1752896547.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1m3mc36,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m3mc36/do_you_really_need_a_coffee_table_in_your_living/,Do you really need a coffee table in your living room?,"I've been thinking a lot about living room furniture lately, especially coffee tables. After recently moving into a new place, I found myself wondering if I really needed one. Turns out, coffee tables are more important than I initially thought.

First off, coffee tables aren't just for coffee (surprise!). They're actually central pieces that tie your whole living room together. I learned this the hard way when I tried going without one for a few months. My living room felt weirdly incomplete, like something was missing.

The main thing I discovered is that coffee tables serve multiple purposes. They're perfect for:
- Placing drinks and snacks while watching TV
- Displaying decorative items and books
- Creating a focal point in the room
- Providing extra storage (if you get one with drawers)
- Acting as an informal dining space when you're having a casual meal

I spent hours researching different styles and found some amazing options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

What really surprised me was how much functionality they add to a space. When friends come over, everyone naturally gravitates toward the coffee table. It becomes this communal spot where people can set their drinks, phones, or snacks.

Size matters too. I learned that your coffee table should be about two-thirds the length of your sofa for the best look. And height-wise, it should be level with or slightly lower than your sofa seats.

Material choice is another big factor. Wood gives a classic, warm feel, while glass makes a room feel bigger. Metal ones are super durable and modern-looking. It really depends on your style and how you plan to use it.

If you're thinking about getting one (which I definitely recommend), check out these options: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. They have everything from modern to traditional styles, and the prices are pretty reasonable.

Something I wish I'd known earlier: consider your lifestyle when choosing. If you have kids, you might want something with rounded corners. If you're tight on space, look for ones with storage. And if you often work from your couch, adjustable height tables are game-changers.

Bottom line? Yes, you really do need a coffee table. It's not just furniture - it's a practical piece that makes your living room more functional and complete. Trust me, once you find the right one, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.",1,1752896362.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Recently official diagnosed ADHD Hyperactive Impulsive. Was not surprised about it. Happy to have the clarity. 

Treating anything with medication is a huge concern for me.

Doing serious 12 step work with a sponsor who studied addiction and psychology definitely gave me the tools I needed to become comfortable in my own skin. I’ve found that there are aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy that mirror the work I have already done, and continue to do. Doesn’t mean it’s perfect, but it’s pretty epic in comparison.

I thought some of my issues stemmed from multiple blunt force head traumas, the most recent one about 13 years ago, and I still do to a degree, but after reading that menopause and adhd share similar issues as longer term post concussion issues, it made perfect sense to me. there isn’t much out there on treating post concussion issues, however, there is with menopause and adhd! yay! so, i’ve been diving into that aspect.

i recently was trying to deal with, what i believe are, high cortisol issues and discovered ketones. while committing to a ketogenic diet isn’t something i can realistically commit to at this time, I have been following a mediterranean diet with moderate success. Three days ago I started taking 1/2 teaspoon of KetoneAid (half of the labels recommended amount), an exogenous ketone supplement (not a replacement for a ketogenic diet, just a supplement), and my brain fog has noticeable cleared. I don’t fall asleep better, but I wake up easier and more refreshed. This morning I only drank a few sips of coffee and felt like I didn’t need to finish it, a first in my lifetime. 

The other upside of using exogenous ketone supplement has been the reduction of feeling like I need to eat beyond what I need. 

Next, I decided to do a little research on ketones and ADHD. It seems like there has been a serious uptick in research and anecdotal evidence that a ketones help with how we are and our relationships with others i.e. becoming more “acceptable”.

I have no idea how this will play out in the long run, but I am very interested to see where this goes.

My hope is to find others going down this path: ketones (exogenous and various levels of ketogenic diets), alternatives to typically prescribed medications, swimming, HIIT, and other body conditioning, etc experiences.

Seeking 'professional' help in this area is proving to be impossible up to now, just like recovery from addition, I’m turning to a community that I can identify with and share experience, strength and hope.  i've seen some older threads but they are no longer active. hoping to open it up again for more input!",1,1752896316.0,adhdmenopause,0,1.0,False

Just wondering if anyone has any tips or recommendations for me to help prepare and feel more confident going into my interview. Any standout questions they're more likely to ask than others? Anything else I should know?

1m3mb4n,https://i.redd.it/rzow8j0l4rdf1.jpeg,Emotional impact of witnessing their grace and power,"Let us revisit an experience from a few weeks ago. It was early in the morning, and I was in pursuit of a fresh cup of coffee. A thin, cool blanket of fog had settled overnight, accompanied by the presence of several eagles.

A significant number of hake had succumbed to the tide, now floating serenely on the water's surface. The eagles appeared to be awaiting the lifting of the fog before commencing their morning meal.

I equipped myself with my camera, fitted with a long lens, and assumed a position of patience. One particular eagle perched quite near, and I anticipated the opportunity for a close-up portrait as the light improved.

I rested my lens on the lower edge of the roof and observed this eagle for an extended period. 

Naturally, I captured numerous photographs, and one image emerged as my favorite. However, two notable aspects are missing from this depiction.

Firstly, this eagle’s left eye is entirely absent. At one moment, it turned to face my direction, and I was taken aback upon realizing the eye was missing. I possess a photograph of this moment; please inform me if you would like to view it.

Secondly, it appears that eagles have a constant need to excrete, even during the night. The deck at Nanook Lodge now bore a fresh coating of white excrement, leading Sam, the owner, to dedicate approximately 30 minutes to pressure washing it away.

It is consistently remarkable to be in proximity to these majestic animals. When an eagle turns to regard you, particularly one with an absent eye, there is a surreal moment of connection that enhances the experience.",2,1752896275.0,birds,0,0.75,False

1m3m834,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m3m834/the_rooster_bar_by_john_grisham/,The Rooster Bar by John Grisham:,"  The end of the year brought the usual holiday festivities, though around the Frazier house there was little to cheer. Mrs. Frazier went through the motions of decorating a small tree and wrapping a few cheap gifts and baking cookies no one really wanted, and, as always, she kept The Nutcracker running nonstop on the stereo as she gamely hummed along in the kitchen as though the season was merry.  
  
  Things were anything but merry. Mr. Frazier had moved out three years earlier, and he wasn’t missed as much as he was despised. In no time, he had moved in with his young secretary, who, as things developed, was already pregnant. Mrs. Frazier, jilted, humiliated, broke, and depressed, was still struggling.  
  
  Louie, her younger son, was under house arrest, sort of free on bail, and facing a rough year ahead with the drug charges and all. He made no effort to buy his mom anything in the way of a gift. His excuse was that he couldn’t leave the house because of the court-ordered monitor attached to his ankle. But even without it, no one expected Louie to go to the trouble of buying gifts. The year before and the year before that both of his ankles had been unburdened and he hadn’t bothered to shop.  
  
  Mark, the older son, was home from the horrors of law school, and, though even poorer than his brother, had managed to buy his mother some perfume. He was scheduled to graduate in May, sit for the bar exam in July, and begin working with a D.C. firm in September, which, as it so happened, was the same month Louie’s trial was on the docket. But Louie’s case would not go to trial for two very good reasons. First, the undercover boys had caught him in the act of selling ten bags of crack—there was even a video—and, second, neither Louie nor his mother could afford a decent lawyer to handle the mess. Throughout the holidays, both Louie and Mrs. Frazier dropped hints that Mark should rush in and volunteer to defend his brother. Wouldn’t it be easy to stall matters until later in the year when Mark was properly admitted to the bar—he was practically there anyway—and once he had his license wouldn’t it be a simple matter of finding one of those technicalities you read about to get the charges dismissed?  
  
  This little fantasy of theirs had some rather large holes in it, but Mark refused to discuss it. When it became apparent that Louie planned to hog the sofa for at least ten hours on New Year’s Day and watch seven straight bowl games, Mark made a quiet exit and went to a friend’s house. Returning home that night, while driving under the influence, he made the decision to flee. He would return to D.C. and kill some time puttering around the law firm where he would soon be employed. Classes didn’t start for almost two weeks, but after ten days of listening to Louie bitch and moan about his problems, not to mention the nonstop Nutcracker, Mark was fed up and looking forward to his last semester of law school.  
  
  He set his alarm for eight the following morning, and over coffee with his mom explained that he was needed back in D.C. Sorry to leave a bit earlier than expected, Mom, and sorry to leave you here all alone with your bad boy, Mom, but I’m outta here. He’s not mine to raise. I got my own problems.  
  
  The first problem was his vehicle, a Ford Bronco he’d been driving since high school. The odometer had frozen at 187,000 miles, and that had happened midway through college. It desperately needed a new fuel pump, one of many replacement parts on the Urgent List. Using tape and paper clips, Mark had been able to wire and jerry-rig the engine, transmission, and brakes for the past two years, but he’d had no luck with the fuel pump. It worked but at a lower capacity than normal, so that the Bronco’s max speed was forty-nine on level ground. To avoid being clobbered by 18-wheelers on the expressways, Mark stuck to the back roads of rural Delaware and the Eastern Shore. The two-hour drive from Dover to central D.C. took twice as long.  
  
  This gave him even more time to consider his other problems. Number two was his suffocating student debt. He’d finished college with $60,000 in loans, and no job. His father, who seemed happily married at the time but was also in debt, had warned him against further studies. He’d said, “Hell, boy, four years of education and you’re sixty grand in the hole. Quit before it gets any worse.” But Mark thought taking any financial advice from his father was foolish, so he worked a couple of years here and there, bartending and delivering pizza, while he haggled with his lenders. Now, looking back, he wasn’t sure where the idea of law school had originated, but he did remember overhearing a conversation between two frat brothers who were pondering weighty matters while drinking heavily. Mark was the bartender, the lounge was not crowded, and after the fourth round of vodka and cranberry juice they talked loud enough for all to hear. Among many interesting things they had said, Mark had always remembered two: “The big D.C. law firms are hiring like crazy.” And, “Starting salaries are one-fifty a year.”  
  
  Not long after that, he bumped into a college friend who was a first-year student at the Foggy Bottom Law School in D.C., and the guy gushed on about his plans to blitz through his studies, finish in two and a half years, and sign on with a big firm for a fat salary. The Feds were throwing loans at students, anybody could qualify, and, well sure, he would graduate with a mountain of debt but nothing he couldn’t wipe out in five years. To his friend, at least, it made perfect sense to “invest in himself” with the debt because it would guarantee all that future earning power.  
  
  Mark took the bait and began studying for the Law School Admission Test. His score was an unimpressive 146, but this did not bother the admissions folks at the Foggy Bottom Law School. Nor did his rather thin undergraduate résumé with an anemic grade point average of 2.8. FBLS accepted him with open arms. His loan applications were quickly approved. Sixty-five thousand bucks were simply transferred from the Department of Education each year to Foggy Bottom. And now, with one semester to go, Mark was staring miserably at the reality of graduating with a combined total, undergrad and law school, principal and interest, of $266,000 in debt.  
  
  Another problem was his job. As it happened, the market wasn’t quite as strong as rumored. Nor was it as vibrant as FBLS had advertised in its slick brochures and near-fraudulent website. Graduates from top-tier law schools were still finding work at enviable salaries. FBLS, though, was not quite in the top tier. Mark had managed to worm his way into a midsized law firm that specialized in “governmental relations,” which meant nothing more than lobbying. His starting salary had not been established, because the firm’s management committee would meet in early January to review profits from the previous year and supposedly jiggle the pay structure. In a few months, Mark would be expected to have an important talk with his “loan counselor” about restructuring his student debt and somehow repaying the entire mess. This counselor had already expressed concern that Mark did not know how much he would be earning. This concerned Mark too, especially when added to the fact that he didn’t trust a single person he’d met at the law firm. As much as he tried to fool himself, he knew deep in his gut that his position was not secure.  
  
  Another problem was the bar exam. Because of demand, the D.C. version of the test was one of the more challenging in the nation, and FBLS grads had been bombing it at an alarming rate. Again, the top schools in town did well. The year before, Georgetown had a 91 percent pass rate. For George Washington it was 89 percent. For FBLS, the pass rate was a pathetic 56 percent. To succeed, Mark needed to start studying now, in early January, and hit the books nonstop for six months.  
  
  But the energy simply wasn’t there, especially in the cold, dreary, depressing days of winter. At times the debt felt like cinder blocks strapped to his back. Walking was a chore. Smiling was difficult. He was living in poverty and his future, even with the job, was bleak. And he was one of the fortunate ones. Most of his classmates had the loans but not the jobs. Looking back, he’d heard the grumbling even in his first year, and with each semester the mood at  
school grew darker, the suspicions heavier. The job market worsened. The bar exam results embarrassed everyone at FBLS. The loans piled up. Now, in his third and last year, it was not unusual to hear students verbally spar with professors in class. The dean wouldn’t come out of his office. Bloggers blistered the school and screamed harsh questions: “Is this a hoax?” “Have we been had?” “Where did all the money go?”  
  
  To varying degrees, almost everyone Mark knew believed that (1) FBLS was a subpar law school that (2) made too many promises, and (3) charged too much money, and (4) encouraged too much debt while (5) admitting a lot of mediocre students who really had no business in law school, and (6) were either not properly prepared for the bar exam or (7) too dumb to pass it.  
  
  There were rumors that applications to FBLS had fallen by 50 percent. With no state support, and no endowment, such a decline would lead to all manner of painful cost cutting, and a bad law school would only get worse. This was fine with Mark Frazier and his friends. They would endure the next four months and happily leave the place, never to return.  
  
  —  
  
  MARK LIVED IN a five-story apartment building that was eighty years old and visibly deteriorating, but the rent was low and this attracted students from George Washington and FBLS. In its earlier days it had been known as the Cooper House, but after three decades of frat-like wear and tear it had earned its nickname as the Coop. Because its elevators seldom worked, Mark took the stairs to the third floor and entered his cramped and sparsely furnished flat, for which he paid $800 a month for five hundred square feet. For some reason he’d cleaned the place after his last exam before the holidays, and as he flipped on lights he was pleased to see that everything was in order. And why shouldn’t it be? The slumlord who owned the place never came around. He unloaded his bags and was struck by the silence. Normally, with a bunch of students, and with thin walls, there was always a racket. Stereos, televisions, arguments, pranks, poker games, fights, guitar playing, even a trombone played by a nerd on the fourth floor that could rattle the entire building. But not today. Everyone was still at home, enjoying the break, and the halls were eerily quiet.  
  
  After half an hour, Mark was bored and left the building. Walking along New Hampshire Avenue, with the wind cutting through his thin fleece and old khakis, he decided, for some reason, to turn onto Twenty-First and stop by the law school to see if it was open. In a city with no shortage of hideous modern buildings, FBLS managed to stand out in its unsightliness. It was a postwar edifice covered with bland yellow bricks on eight levels slung together in asymmetrical wings, some failed architect’s effort at making a statement. Supposedly, it once was an office building, but walls had been knocked out with abandon to create cramped lecture halls on the four lower floors. On the fifth was the library, a rabbits’ warren of large, retrofitted rooms packed with seldom-touched books and some replicated portraits of unknown judges and legal scholars. The faculty had offices on the sixth and seventh floors, and on the eighth, and as far away from the students as possible, the administration carried on, with the dean solidly hidden in a corner office from which he seldom ventured.  
  
  The front door was unlocked and Mark entered the empty lobby. While he appreciated its warmth, he found the area, as always, utterly depressing. A huge bulletin board covered one wall with all manner of notices and announcements and enticements. There were a few slick posters advertising opportunities to study abroad, and the usual assortment of handmade ads offering stuff for sale—books, bikes, tickets, course outlines, tutors by the hour—and apartments for rent. The bar exam loomed over the entire school like a dark cloud and there were posters extolling the excellence of some review courses. If he searched hard enough he could possibly find a few employment opportunities, but at FBLS those had become scarcer by the year. In one corner he saw the same old brochures hawking even more student loans. At the far end of the lobby there were vending machines and a small coffee bar, but nothing was being brewed during the break.  
  
  He fell into a battered leather chair and soaked in the gloominess of his school. Was it really a school or was it just another diploma mill? The answer was becoming clear. For the thousandth time he wished he had never walked through the front doors as an unsuspecting first-year student. Now, almost three years later, he was burdened by loans he couldn’t imagine paying off. If there was a light at the end of the tunnel, he couldn’t see it.  
  
  And why would anyone name a school Foggy Bottom? As if the law school experience itself wasn’t dreary enough, some bright soul had, some twenty years earlier, tagged it with a name that conveyed even more cheerlessness. That guy, now dead, had sold the school to some Wall Street investors who owned a string of law schools that were reportedly producing handsome profits while cranking out little in the way of legal talent.  
  
  How do you buy and sell law schools? It was still a mystery.  
  
  Mark heard voices and hurriedly left the building. He hiked down New Hampshire to Dupont Circle, where he ducked into Kramer Books for a coffee and a quick thaw. He walked everywhere. His Bronco lurched and stalled too much in city traffic, and he kept it tucked away in a lot behind the Coop, always with the key in the ignition. Unfortunately, so far no one had been tempted to steal it.  
  
  Warm again, he hustled six blocks north along Connecticut Avenue. The law firm of Ness Skelton occupied a few floors in a modern building near the Hinckley Hilton. The previous summer Mark had managed to weasel his way inside when he accepted an internship that paid less than minimum wage. At major law firms, the summer programs were used to entice top students to the big life. Little work was expected. The interns were given ridiculously easy schedules, along with tickets to ball games and invitations to fine parties in the splendid backyards of the wealthy partners. Once seduced, they signed on, and upon graduation were soon thrown into the meat grinder of hundred-hour weeks.  
  
  Not so at Ness Skelton. With only fifty lawyers, it was far from a top-ten firm. Its clients were trade associations—Soybean Forum, Retired Postal Workers, Beef and Lamb Council, National Asphalt Contractors, Disabled Railroad Engineers—and several defense contractors desperate for their share of the pork. The firm’s expertise, if it had any, was maintaining relationships with Congress. Its summer intern program was designed more to exploit cheap labor than to attract top students. Mark had worked hard and suffered through the stultifying work. At the end of the summer, when he had received an offer that somewhat resembled a position upon passing the bar exam, he couldn’t decide if he should celebrate or cry. Nonetheless, he jumped at what was being offered—there was nothing else on the table—and proudly became one of the few FBLS students with a future. Throughout the fall, he had gently pressed his supervisor about the terms of his upcoming employment but got nowhere. There might be a merger in the works. There might be a split. There might be a lot of things, but an employment contract was not one of them.  
  
  So he hung around. Afternoons, Saturdays, holidays, anytime he was bored he would stop by the firm, always with a big fake smile and an eagerness to pitch in and help with the grunt work. It was not clear if this was beneficial, but he figured it couldn’t hurt.  
  
  His supervisor was named Randall, a ten-year guy on the verge of making partner, and thus under a lot of pressure. A Ness Skelton associate who didn’t make partner after ten years was quietly shown the door. Randall was a George Washington law grad, which, in the city’s pecking order, was a step down from Georgetown but several notches above Foggy Bottom. The hierarchy was clear and rigid, and its worst perpetrators were the GW lawyers. They detested being looked down upon by the Georgetown gang; thus they were eager to look down with even more disdain on anyone from FBLS. The entire firm reeked of cliques and snobbery, and Mark often wondered how in hell he wound up there. Two associates were from FBLS, but they were so busy trying to distance themselves from their school they had no time to lend Mark a hand. Indeed, they seemed to ignore him more than anyone else. Mark had often mumbled, “What a way to run a law firm.” But then he figur  
ed that every profession had its levels of status. He was far too worried about his own skin to fret over where the other cutthroats had studied law. He had his own problems.  
  
  He had e-mailed Randall and said he would be dropping by to do whatever grunt work was available. Randall greeted him with a curt “Back so soon?”  
  
  Sure, Randall, and how were your holidays? Great to see you. “Yeah, got bored with all the holiday crap. What’s up?”  
  
  “Two of the secretaries are out with the flu,” Randall said. He pointed to a stack of documents a foot thick. “I need that copied fourteen times, all collated and stapled.”  
  
  Okay, back to the copy room, Mark thought. “Sure,” he said as if he couldn’t wait to jump in. He hauled the documents down to the basement, to a dungeon filled with copiers. He spent the next three hours doing mindless work for which he would be paid nothing.  
  
  He almost missed Louie and his ankle monitor.  
  
  2  
  
  Like Mark, Todd Lucero was inspired to become a lawyer by booze-tinted conversations he’d overheard in a bar. For the past three years, he had been mixing drinks at the Old Red Cat, a pub-style watering hole favored by students from GW and Foggy Bottom. After college at Frostburg State, he’d left Baltimore and drifted into D.C. in search of a career. Finding none, he hired on at the Old Red Cat as a part-timer and soon realized he had a fondness for pulling pints and mixing strong drinks. He’d come to love the pub life and had a gift for schmoozing with the serious drinkers while placating the rowdies. Todd was everybody’s favorite bartender and was on a first-name basis with hundreds of his regulars.  
  
  Many times over the past two and a half years he had thought of quitting law school to pursue his dream of owning his own bar. His father, though, had strong opinions to the contrary. Mr. Lucero was a cop in Baltimore and had always pushed his son to obtain a professional degree. Pushing was one thing, but paying for it was something else. And so Todd had fallen into the same trap of borrowing easy money and handing it over to the greedy folks at FBLS.  
  
  He and Mark Frazier had met the first day, during orientation, back when they were both starry-eyed and envisioning big law careers with fat salaries, back when they, along with 350 others, were horribly naive. He vowed to quit after his first year, but his father yelled at him. Because of his commitment to the bar, he had never found the time to knock on doors around D.C. and hustle for summer internships. He vowed to quit after his second year and cut off the flow of debt, but his loan counselor strongly advised against it. As long as he was in school he did not have to confront some brutal repayment schedule, so it made perfect sense to keep borrowing in order to graduate and find one of those lucrative jobs that, in theory, would eventually take care of the debts. Now, though, with only one semester to go, he knew only too well such jobs did not exist.  
  
  If only he’d borrowed $195,000 from a bank and opened his bar. He could be printing money and enjoying life.  
  
  —  
  
  MARK ENTERED THE Old Red Cat just after dark and took his favorite place at the end of the bar. He fist-bumped Todd and said, “Good to see you, man.”  
  
  “You too,” Todd said as he slid over a frosty mug of light beer. With his seniority, Todd could comp anyone he damn well pleased, and Mark had not paid in years.  
  
  With the students away, the place was quiet. Todd leaned on his elbows and asked, “So what are you up to?”  
  
  “Well, I’ve spent the afternoon at dear old Ness Skelton, in the copy room sorting papers that no one will ever read. More stupid work. Even the paralegals look down their noses at me. I hate the place and I haven’t even been hired yet.”  
  
  “Still no contract?”  
  
  “None, and the picture gets fuzzier every day.”  
  
  Todd took a quick sip from his mug stashed under the counter. Even with his seniority, he wasn’t supposed to drink on the job, but his boss wasn’t in. He asked, “So how was Christmas around the Frazier house?”  
Ho, ho, ho. I lasted ten miserable days and got the hell out. You?”  
  
  “Three days, then duty called and I came back to work. How’s Louie?”  
  
  “Still seriously indicted, still looking at real jail time. I should feel sorry for him but compassion runs thin for a guy who sleeps half the day and spends the other half on the sofa watching Judge Judy and bitching about his ankle monitor. My poor mom.”  
  
  “You’re pretty hard on him.”  
  
  “Not hard enough. That’s his problem. No one’s ever been hard on Louie. He got caught with pot when he was thirteen, blamed it on a friend, and of course my parents rushed to his defense. He’s never been held accountable. Until now.”  
  
  “Bummer, man. I can’t imagine having a brother in prison.”  
  
  “Yeah, it sucks. I just wish I could help him but there’s no way.”  
  
  “I won’t even ask about your dad.”  
  
  “Didn’t see him and didn’t hear from him. Not even a card. He’s fifty years old and the proud papa of a three-year-old, so I guess he played Santa Claus. Laid out a bunch of toys under the tree, smiled like an idiot when the kid came down the stairs squealing. What a rat.”  
  
  Two coeds walked to the bar and Todd left to serve them. Mark pulled out his phone and checked his messages.  
  
  When Todd returned, he asked, “Have you seen any grades yet?”  
  
  “No. Who cares? We’re all top students.” Grades at Foggy Bottom were a joke. It was imperative that the school’s graduates finish with sparkling résumés, and to that end the professors passed out As and Bs like cheap candy. No one flunked out of FBLS. So, of course, this had created a culture of rather listless studying, which, of course, killed any chance of competitive learning. A bunch of mediocre students became even more mediocre. No wonder the bar exam was such a challenge. Mark added, “And you really can’t expect a bunch of overpaid professors to grade exams during the holidays, can you?”  
  
  Todd took another sip, leaned even closer, and said, “We have a bigger problem.”  
  
  “Gordy?”  
  
  “Gordy.”  
  
  “I was afraid of that. I’ve texted and tried to call but his phone’s turned off. What’s going on?”  
  
  “It’s bad,” Todd said. “Evidently, he went home for Christmas and spent his time fighting with Brenda. She wants a big church wedding with a thousand people. Gordy doesn’t want to get married. Her mother has a lot to say. His mother is not speaking to her mother and the whole thing is blowing up.”  
  
  “They’re getting married May 15, Todd. As I recall, you and I signed on as groomsmen.”  
  
  “Well, don’t bet on it. He’s already back in town and off his meds. Zola stopped by this afternoon and gave me the heads-up.”  
  
  “What meds?”  
  
  “It’s a long story.”  
  
  “What meds?”  
  
  “He’s bipolar, Mark. Diagnosed a few years back.”  
  
  “You’re kidding, right?”  
  
  “Why would I kid about this? He’s bipolar and Zola says he’s off his medication.”  
  
  “Why wouldn’t he tell us?”  
  
  “I can’t answer that.”  
  
  Mark took a long drink of beer and shook his head. He asked, “Zola’s back already?”  
  
  “Yes, evidently she and Gordy hurried back for a few days of fun and games, though I’m not sure they’re having much fun. She thinks he quit his meds about a month ago when we were studying for finals. One day he’s manic and bouncing off the walls; then he’s in a stupor after sipping tequila and smoking weed. He’s talking crazy, says he wants to quit school and run off to Jamaica, with Zola of course. She thinks he might do something stupid and hurt himself.”  
  
  “Gordy is stupid. He’s engaged to his high school sweetheart, a real cutie who happens to have money, and now he’s shacking up with an African girl whose parents and brothers are in this country without the benefit of those immigration papers everyone is talking about. Yes, the boy is stupid.”  
  
  “Gordy’s in trouble, Mark. He’s been sliding for several weeks and he needs our help.”  
  
  Mark pushed his beer away, but only a few inches, and clasped his hands behind his head. “As if we don’t have enough to worry about. How, exactly, are we supposed to help?”  
  
  “You tell me. She’s trying to keep an eye on him and she wants us to come over tonight.”  
  
  Mark started laughing and took another sip.  
  
  “What’s so funny?” Todd asked.  
  
  “Nothing, but can you imagine the scandal in Martinsburg, West Virginia, if word got out that Gordon Tanner, whose father is a church deacon and whose fiancée is the daughter of a prominent doctor, lost his mind and quit law school to run off to Jamaica with an African Muslim?”  
  
  “I can almost see the humor.”  
  
  “Well, try harder. It’s a scream.” But the laughter had stopped. “Look, Todd, we can’t make him take his meds. If we tried to he’d kick both our asses.”  
  
  “He needs our help, Mark. I get off at nine tonight and we’re going over.”  
  
  A man in a nice suit sat at the bar and Todd walked over to take his order. Mark sipped his beer and sank into an even deeper funk.  
  
  3  
  
  Three years before Zola Maal was born, her parents fled Senegal. They resettled in a Johannesburg slum with their two young sons and found menial jobs scrubbing floors and digging ditches. After two years, they had saved enough for a boat ride. Using the services of a broker/trafficker, they paid for a miserable trip to Miami aboard a Liberian freighter, along with a dozen other Senegalese. When they were safely smuggled ashore, an uncle met them and drove them to his home in Newark, New Jersey, where they lived in a two-room apartment in a building filled with other folks from Senegal, not a single one of whom held a green card.  
  
  A year after they arrived in the U.S., Zola was born at Newark’s University Hospital and instantly became an American citizen. While her parents worked two and three jobs, all for cash at less than minimum wage, Zola and her brothers attended school and assimilated into the community. As devout Muslims, they practiced their religion, though at an early age Zola found herself attracted to Western ways. Her father was a strict man who insisted that their native tongues of Wolof and French be replaced with English. The boys absorbed the new language and helped their parents with it at home.  
  
  The family moved often around Newark, always to cramped apartments, each one slightly larger than the last, and always with other Senegalese close by. All of them lived in fear of being deported, but there was safety in numbers, or so they believed. Every knock on the door brought a brief shudder of fear. Staying out of trouble was imperative, and Zola and her brothers were taught to avoid anything that might attract the wrong kind of attention. Even though she had the right papers, she knew that her family was in jeopardy. She lived with the horror of her parents and brothers being arrested and sent back to Senegal.  
  
  When she was fifteen, she found her first job washing dishes in a diner, for cash of course, and not much of it. Her brothers worked too, and the entire family scrimped and saved as much as possible.  
  
  When Zola wasn’t working she was studying. She breezed through high school with good grades and enrolled in a community college as a part-time student. A small scholarship allowed her to become full-time and also landed her a job in the college library. But she still washed dishes, and cleaned houses with her mother, and babysat children for family friends with better jobs. Her oldest brother married an American girl who was not a Muslim, and though that meant an easier route to citizenship, it caused serious friction with her parents. The brother and his new wife moved to California to start another life.  
  
  At the age of twenty, Zola left home and enrolled as a junior at Montclair State. She lived in a dorm with two American girls, both of whom were also on tight budgets. She chose accounting as a major because she enjoyed working with numbers and had a knack for finance. She studied hard when time allowed, but the juggling of two and sometimes three jobs often interfered with the books. Her roommates intro  
duced her to the partying scene and she discovered she had a knack for that too. While she clung to the strict Muslim prohibition against alcohol, and she really didn’t like the taste of any of it anyway, she was more receptive to other temptations, primarily fashion and sex. She was almost six feet tall and was often told how great she looked in tight jeans. Her first boyfriend happily taught her all about sex. Her second introduced her to recreational drugs. By the end of her junior year she silently and defiantly considered herself a nonpracticing Muslim, though her parents had no clue.  
  
  Her parents would soon have more serious problems. During the fall semester of her senior year, her father was arrested and jailed for two weeks before bail was arranged. At the time, he was working for a painting contractor, another Senegalese with proper documents. Evidently, his boss had underbid a union contractor for a job painting the interior of a large office complex in Newark. The union contractor notified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and reported that illegals were being used. That was serious enough, but some office supplies were allegedly missing and fingers were being pointed. Zola’s father and four other undocumented workers were charged with grand larceny. He was served with a Notice to Appear in immigration court, along with a criminal indictment.  
  
  Zola hired a lawyer who claimed to specialize in such matters and the family forked over a retainer of $9,000, virtually all its savings. The lawyer was extremely busy and seldom returned their phone calls. With her parents and brother hiding in and around Newark, Zola was left to haggle with the lawyer. She grew to despise the man, a fast talker who liked to stretch the truth, and would have fired him had it not been for the retainer. There was no money to hire another. When he failed to appear in court, the judge kicked him off the case. Zola eventually convinced a legal aid lawyer to step in and the indictment was dismissed. The deportation, however, was not going away. The case dragged on and became so distracting that her grades suffered. After several court appearances and hearings, she became convinced that all lawyers were either lazy or stupid and that she could do a better job herself.  
  
  She fell for the scam that easy federal money could make law school possible for everyone, and took the first bold steps that would lead to Foggy Bottom. Now, halfway through her final year of law school, she owed more money than she could imagine. Both parents and Bo, her unmarried brother, were still facing deportation, though their cases were languishing in the backlogged immigration courts.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

With rising rents, it’s getting harder for big lifestyle and retail brands to survive. Look at what happened to Cathay. Places that used to be go-to hangout spots are either closing or becoming unrecognisable.

Online shopping has changed the game too. People would rather buy things from apps than head out to a physical store. Even food is easier to get through delivery. So what’s left to draw people out?

It feels like more empty units are being turned into co-working spaces. With freelancing and remote work picking up, maybe that’s where people will “hang out” in future. Quiet spaces with wifi, coffee and Zoom calls.

But it’s kind of sad if our social lives are reduced to just that. Are we heading toward a future where everyone stays home, glued to apps and screens? Will new generations even care about having vibrant neighbourhoods to explore?

Also, what will be the future of ""clubbing""? I read from somewhere that young people these days prefer day clubbing or something.

3. Any advice on breaking the no-callback streak

## Key Features Analysis

The best large round coffee tables of 2025 are distinguished by their quality of materials, robust construction, design aesthetics, and functional features. Key features range from durable surfaces that resist everyday wear and tear to innovative storage solutions that maximize space utilization. Below is a closer look at some characteristics that define the leading products in this category.

**Diameter and Height:** Understanding the dimensions of a large round coffee table is critical to ensuring it fits proportionally within your living room.

A typical large round coffee table ranges from 36 to 48 inches in diameter, and the height should generally be level with or slightly lower than the height of your sofa cushions, approximately 16 to 20 inches. These dimensions offer a generous surface area for drinks, snacks, or decorative items, while still allowing for easy movement around the table.Measuring your space before purchasing is essential to avoid overcrowding the room.

**Material Composition:** Coffee tables come in a variety of materials, each offering a unique aesthetic and level of durability.

Solid wood, such as oak or walnut, offers a timeless appeal and exceptional durability, making it a smart choice for high-traffic areas. On the other hand, engineered wood like plywood or MDF offers a more affordable option while still providing a sturdy surface. Glass tabletops offer a sleek, modern look but require more frequent cleaning to maintain clarity.metal frames, often constructed of steel or iron, provide a sturdy base and contribute to an industrial or contemporary aesthetic.

**Surface Finish:** The surface finish not only contributes to the aesthetic appeal of the coffee table but also affects its durability and ease of maintenance.

A sealed wood finish protects the wood from moisture and scratches, ensuring longevity. Powder-coated metal finishes can prevent rust and chipping, maintaining the table's appearance over time. If you opt for a glass top, a tempered glass surface is crucial for safety, as it is more resistant to breakage and shatters into small, less harmful fragments. Laminate or veneer finishes offer a cost-effective way to mimic the look of natural materials while providing a relatively durable and easy-to-clean surface.

**Base Design and Stability:** Stability is a foundational aspect of any coffee table, and the base design plays a critical role ensuring this.

A pedestal base, frequently enough constructed of solid wood or metal, provides a sleek and modern look, distributing weight evenly across the floor. Four-legged designs, typically made of wood or metal, offer a more customary look and provide reliable stability, especially if legs are connected with horizontal stretchers.Sled bases, characterized by flat, wide runners, offer stability and a unique contemporary aesthetic, distributing weight over a larger surface area. Ensure the base is level and sturdy to prevent wobbling or tipping, especially on uneven surfaces.

**Safety and Accessibility:** Round coffee tables eliminate sharp corners, making them a safer choice, especially in homes with children or elderly individuals. Ample legroom encourages movement around the table.

The rounded edges substantially reduce the risk of accidental bumps and scrapes,making the space safer for children playing or anyone navigating around the table.This design is particularly beneficial in smaller rooms where space is limited.The absence of sharp corners not only enhances safety but also creates a softer, more inviting aesthetic, contributing to the overall comfort of the living room.

**Versatile functionality:** Ideal for both casual use and formal entertaining, large round coffee tables can serve many purposes.

This piece can be used for serving snacks during movie nights, displaying decorative items, or simply providing a resting place for magazines and remote controls.

1m3lq8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansPumpingMilk/comments/1m3lq8z/how_to_increase_supply/,How to increase supply,"Long post with tips on how to increase low milk supply. 

These are things that helped me for anyone interested in increasing their milk supply. It was very stressful for me and I considered quitting Breast feeding altogether many times. But with commitment I am seeing results finally! 

I am 6 weeks post c section. When I started pumping to increase supply I only got 10mils per breast sometimes only 10 total but I am now getting 60-100 sometimes per breast! I used to get less than 100 mils a day but now I’m getting 3x that amount. It took about two weeks. Im still not producing nearly as much as some mothers but I know I will get there. I have limitations that decrease my milk im trying to overcome! 

First of all get a pump. I started with the Medela symphony. The community nurse lent me the symphony but they needed it back. I now have the Medela freestyle and it’s incredible. I bought it used from marketplace for a great price. It’s So comfortable I forget it’s on. Being comfortable is very important. Try not to watch every drop that comes out. That stressed me out with the hand pumps, just watching it drip and most times nothing at all. 

The correct Nipple flange is very important. Too big and it will cause really bad nipple pain, I learned this the hard way. Be sure to replace your valves every 2-8 weeks. If you pump exclusively then you may need to replace them every 2 weeks. It greatly affects suction and amount you will pump. 

Try to continue breast feeding as much as you can (if you can) the baby gets more milk from your breast than the pump. What you pump is not what you produce so don’t stress yourself out with the amount you’re pumping. Tomee tipee bottles mimic the breast. It’s slow flow and breast shaped and I found this the best for not causing nipple confusion. My baby is able to switch between bottle and breast easier with these bottles. 

Keep in mind the regular bottle flows very fast so your baby will eat more than they actually need so don’t use that as a marker for if youre producing enough milk. I was so paranoid I wasn’t making enough for her and now im struggling breast feeding exclusively because I started supplementing with formula. Trust your body! It knows what it’s doing and dont listen to all advice. It can be overwhelming and not every one is the same. You may make the wrong decisions for you if you listen to every one else.

Pump every two or 3 hours and once at night. You produce more prolactin in the early morning from 3 am on. If you can’t wake up to pump don’t worry i often can’t because I’m so tired and if I get up to pump it often wakes my baby. Your sleep is more important but if you can get up to pump that’s great. 

I power pump every 2 hours and this has been the most effective for increasing supply, you only need to power pump once a day though if this is too much. 20 mins on, 10 rest, 10 on, 10 rest, 10 on. Pumping is time consuming so do whatever you can. Anything helps. The time you start pumping is the marker for when you will pump next. regardless how long pumping takes to finish. The time you start pumping, pump two hours after that start time. 

If you are breast feeding and want to increase your supply pump for 15 minutes after feeds. Even if nothing comes out you are signaling the body it needs to make more milk. 

The more you take from your breast the more you will produce the next 1-3 days. Everyday I pump more than the previous day: even one mil more is a triumph. The Medela freestyle has an app that tracks your start time and you can track how much you pumped for ease. 

Eat oatmeal everyday! It’s incredible how much this helped me right away. Make sure you’re eating a lot of food. You need more than you ate when pregnant. If you’re not eating you will not make milk. I usually skipped breakfast and lunch and had only coffee. The day I started eating I produced more milk right away. 

Eat nuts and lots of protein and good fat. 
You can get a prescription called domperidon for milk production but it’s dependent on your area; im in Canada so it’s available here. If not you can get supplements like liquid gold, you can get mothers milk tea as well. 

Your babies saliva activates let down. If you’re not able to latch then putting their saliva on your nipple is an option as well to get your body producing more. 

Don’t feel bad if you have to supplement with formula. Fed is best. Dont give up. Pumping every two hours will work in time to increase supply. I know it’s hard sometimes. Taking care of baby when you’re trying to pump every two hours is harder than it sounds but it’s so rewarding 🙂

Drink water all the time then drink some more! You require a lot of water to produce milk. If you don’t like water then get some flavour for your water, whatever you can do to increase liquid intake, do it! 

Try not to stress (easier said than done) you’re doing the best you can and that’s enough! Your baby loves you, if you have to stop breast feeding or pumping for your sanity then do it but if you keep pumping I know you will see results. 

Sorry for the long post, I hope this helps someone! Keep at it, you’re doing great. Give yourself grace and love yourself and your family!

1m3lm8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m3lm8x/is_keurig_coffee_the_same_as_instant_coffee/,Is Keurig coffee the same as instant coffee?,"After trying both Keurig coffee and instant coffee for years, I can definitely say they're not the same thing. Let me break down the key differences I've noticed and explain why I eventually switched to using a Keurig machine for my daily coffee.

Instant coffee is basically coffee that's been brewed, dehydrated, and turned into powder or crystals. When you add hot water, it dissolves back into coffee. Simple, but in my experience, it often tastes flat and lacks the richness of freshly brewed coffee.

Keurig coffee, on the other hand, is actual ground coffee sealed in K-cups. When you use a Keurig machine, it pushes hot water through these grounds, similar to how traditional coffee makers work. This brewing process gives you a fresher taste and better aroma compared to instant coffee.

I remember when I first got my Keurig brewer (I got mine from here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers), I was surprised by how much better the coffee tasted compared to the instant coffee I'd been drinking. The flavor was fuller, and it actually smelled like fresh coffee.

Some key differences I've noticed:
- Brewing time: Instant coffee dissolves immediately, while Keurig takes about 1 minute
- Taste: Keurig produces a more authentic coffee flavor
- Variety: K-cups come in hundreds of flavors and brands
- Convenience: Both are easy, but Keurig gives you fresh-brewed quality

One thing I love about using a Keurig is the consistency. Every cup tastes the same, unlike instant coffee where the taste can vary depending on how much powder you use. Plus, there's no mess with measuring or dealing with wet grounds.

The initial cost of a Keurig machine might seem high compared to buying instant coffee, but I've found it worth the investment. If you're interested in trying one, I've had great experiences with the models available here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

The biggest advantage I've found is that Keurig bridges the gap between instant coffee's convenience and traditional coffee's quality. You get a fresh-brewed cup without the hassle of dealing with filters and grounds.

While instant coffee still has its place (I keep some for emergencies), I've found that Keurig coffee provides a much better daily coffee experience. It's fresher, tastier, and still super convenient - you just pop in a pod and press a button.",1,1752894075.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

1m3ljm5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3ljm5,Brunch whisky! Port Ellen James Macarthur 12 year old 62.7% review,"**Port Ellen**  
**James Macarthur**  
**12-Year-Old**  
**Pale Sherry**  
**Bottled \~1985–1986**  
**62.7% ABV**

Thank you to the friend who gifted this sample to me.

**On the nose... Powerful and aromatic!**

When first opened, the alcohol felt a little obtrusive and needed quite a lot of time to settle in the glass. Now that I’m revisiting the last third of this miniature—after it’s had some air contact in the bottle—the whisky has relaxed, and the alcohol now translates to richness and power.

The distinctive notes of hot tar, coal smoke, melted rubber, and sweet gasoline are the first to greet the nose. There’s a touch of truffle oil as well, which I’d attribute to the OBE and high proof.

As it unfolds, I get notes of Maldon sea salt flakes, heated steel, dark roasted coffee beans, granite, and red apples coated in brown toffee sauce. The coastal notes aren’t as prominent initially—the dirty, powerful industrial aspects take the lead here, with the gasoline and roasted coffee lending richness and depth to the dram.

An unexpected tropical layer emerges with charred pineapple jam, grapefruit, and clementine, alongside a softer, elegant, earthy note of matcha powder.

In time, the Port Ellen distillate shifts gears, and a clear salinity builds, with notes of dirty brine and salted lemons.

**On the palate**: it’s very candied and rich—black liquorice, sea salt, pineapple jam, diesel fuel, minerals.  
Sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami!  
The balance, intensity, and power are lovely.

**The finish?** Very long and saturated—as expected.

This is definitely a heavy and dirty Port Ellen, and quite different from the dark sherry 59% James Macarthur 12-Year-Old bottled for Scoma.  
While that expression was about elegant roundness and integration between the distillate and sherry cask maturation, this one is all about unapologetically big, intense, burly power.

Personally, I prefer its dark sherry 59% sibling. To taste them side by side would be the ultimate pleasure.

Initially, I rated this 91 pts, but it has improved significantly—I’d now readjust my score to **93 points**.

I was hoping this would be an equal contender, but alas, I’d place it below:

* **1970 Intertrade 62.4%** – similar in style but less sherry-influenced, with more muscular and dirty oceanic flavors. **94 pts**
* **1969 Celtic label 64.7%** – more chiselled, crystalline, and complex overall, with better structure. **96 pts**

We left plenty of time to get to the station, but Naver maps sent us to a metro that had a ton of stairs so it took a few minutes longer to get to Seoul Station than planned. Still, we made it with all 4 of our roller bags and backpacks and the train still hadn't been assigned a teack, so I figured that there was a little time to get a coffee and some pastries. Then I made the first big mistake of buying the kids one hot chocolate each. It was pretty hot and took a few minutes to prepare so I had to hold all 3 cups and then realized there was only 9 minutes to get to the train. So we started walking to the track along with a to of other people and due to all the drinks I was carrying (which were also almost burning my hands), I couldn't get my phone out to check which car we were so we went down the wrong set of stairs and ended up at the wrong side of the train. Then we only had 2 minutes until departure and I didn't want to miss the train or get separated from the family so we just got on the wrong side of the train. We were probably in car 6 and we needed to get to car 18. As Americans we have little train experience (especially with baggage as a family, I have managed on my own for work a few times) so we weren't really prepared for the impossibility of walking through the aisle towards our assigned car. After some time we basically gave up and just sat down in 4 open seats and decided to finish our food and drink before proceeding toward our seats again. We knew that Seoul has two stations so we figured we should vacate the seats that weren't ours before the next load of passengers boarded. This worked alright, but the kids didn't finish the last of their hot chocolate because it was too bitter (not well mixed). Then we got up and headed through the aisles again, but we only made it to maybe car 14 before we arrived at the next station and we were confronted by another stream of passengers. At this point we were completely blocking the aisle so we tried to pull off into the nearest seats, but the seat I chose belonged to someone who wanted to sit down. So I panicked and tried to lift my luggage into the overhead storage to make room to get out of the way. But at this point the partially drank hot chocolate that I was carrying in a bag fell out as I was lifting my luggage and onto someone's tray and started to drip into their lap. I could only apologize and I didn't even have any napkins on cash. So now I feel like a complete idiot and am perpetuating the stereotype of rude and bumbling Americans and if whoever I spilled on happens to read this, please send me a picture of your clothes or ticket and I will compensate you.

TL;DR: Made the mistake of buying hot drinks before boarding the wrong end of the train with too much baggage and managed to spill hot chocolate on someone. ",1,1752893769.0,tifu,8,0.57,False

And I’m not some one who’s losing weight breast feeding I very much still have a soft postpartum body, and my face and neck look permanently puffy. I do my best to eat and not feel to guilty but this week has been hard and I’m wondering if I should be making healthier choices. 

On a usual day I wake up have a small but dense breakfast (cottage cheese peaches and coffee) I’ll have a snack while feeding (cheese popcorn, chocolate covered almonds and dried mango) and then for lunch I’ll have something fast (Mac and cheese or something that’s ready in 5 mins or less). Then for dinner I do my best to make a healthy substantial meal (something like salmon potatoes and asparagus). And then every night I have some ice cream (guilty pleasure, that I’m feeling increasingly guilty about). 

However for the last week I haven’t had much support and work has been stressful so when it comes time for dinner I’ve been ordering take out for dinner. And it’s been burgers and fries. I can’t bring myself to order a salad the amount of salad is need to eat to feel full would be obscene.

So I guess I’m wondering does anyone else feel like this? How are you coping? Am I permanently demolishing my health and figure? Do you have any favorite healthy-ish snacks you’d recommend?

Also as my little one has gotten older she is eating for less time but I’m still just as hungry as ever. Has she just gotten more efficient? Or am I still eating for 5 hours worth of feeding when she’s only eating for 2.5?

I am 19 years old, and for the past 3 years, I always have illness or disease in my mind. Whenever I feel physical pain or feel unwell, I automatically think it is deadly. I was able to calm down and control myself the past few years, but lately, it's getting out of my control. It is definitely affecting my routine.

I wasn’t able to sleep because my breathing became heavy (I had chocolate coffee). It kept me awake all night. I was afraid I might die of a heart attack. Even though I tried breathing exercises and drank plenty of water, my heartbeat was still not normal.

I just feel frustrated with my situation! I think of brain cancer when I have a headache. Soft poops? Colon cancer it is! Loss of balance and dizziness? I am sos sure it is Leukemia, even though I recently tested for CBC and it showed mild anemia. Sore throat? My mind tells me it's throat cancer! Fast heart rate? Definitely a heart attack. I think I have already diagnosed myself with all kinds of illnesses and types of cancer.

It’s also not helping that every time I open my Facebook, posts about condolences would randomly pop up even though I’m not following those accounts. I would think it is foreshadowing of my death.

For the past 2 months, I’ve randomly felt a fast heart rate, headache, cold sweats, and dizziness—especially when I think about my health. I know that an overall check-up would soothe this constant worry, but I know my parents will just scold me for thinking too much and blame it all on not sleeping early.

All I want right now is to have a peaceful sleep without having to think of dying in my sleep. I want to wake up without checking if something feels wrong with my body.

Finished the white shade Dungeon before starting the project more seriously, and hit pan on Vanishing Cabinet before the project as well.

Hit pan on Weekend, Beignets, and Black Coffee in July. I use black coffee as my winged liner on full eye look days because it’s more pigmented than Dark Mark for my personal preference.

I met the woman once when I delivered some coffee pods and other supplies they were running low on and got a weird vibe from her as she was very skinny and missing a few teeth. They checked out around 11:00. I arrived at 1:30 to restock the apartment and retrieve my appliance. The apartment had already been cleaned. The appliance was missing and in its place was a super cheap replacement, with dust on it. My first impression is that it came from Goodwill or a garage sale.

I politely sent them a request for reimbursement. The man replied with a long, wordy denial, claiming they left the good appliance on the counter, but had seen the bad one stored on a shelf. Air Cover paid out $18, which doesn’t begin to cover the cost.

I looked through the security camera footage and did not see anything incriminating. It’s possible the cleaners took it out the back door or hid it to retrieve later, although our primary housekeeper is honest and reliable. But one of her family members maybe?

Roast Jamie Otis and Doug hehner
ChatGPT said:
Alright, buckle up — here’s a lighthearted roast of Jamie Otis and Doug Hehner, the first couple from Married at First Sight who somehow turned a reality TV experiment into a full-blown lifestyle brand, complete with emotional Instagram reels and candle-sponsored therapy sessions.

Jamie Otis:
Jamie went on national TV to get married to a stranger, and somehow still acts shocked when things get dramatic. She’s like if Pinterest came to life, cried during sex, and then sold you an organic diaper. Her entire Instagram grid looks like a Hallmark movie threw up on a mommy blog.

Jamie could make tripping over a laundry basket into a five-part story about resilience, trauma healing, and the importance of gratitude... with 17 sponsored links. Girl, we get it — you’re real, raw, and probably 90% essential oils at this point.

Doug Hehner:
Doug is like a human Golden Retriever — sweet, loyal, and slightly confused by everything happening around him. His main personality traits are ""supportive husband"" and “guy who didn’t freak out when his wife cried on their wedding night.”

You have to admire his patience, though. Doug could sit through a three-hour Instagram Live where Jamie cries about laundry and still say, “I love you, babe” with a straight face. That man deserves a Nobel Peace Prize — or at least hazard pay.

Together:
They’re like a rom-com couple that never ends — except instead of ending at “happily ever after,” it’s “check out our fertility journey in our 67-minute YouTube vlog.” They’ve been “open and honest” for so long, we know more about their marriage than we do about our own family members’.

All jokes aside — they’re clearly committed to each other and doing the work... even if the work involves a camera crew, brand deals, and a new podcast every six months.




Title: “Jamie & Doug: Overshare Battle – The Comedy Sketch”
(A parody roast sketch in the style of SNL )

🎤 ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Live from the overshare capital of the internet, it’s… Jamie & Doug: Overshare Battle!
The only marriage show where love, therapy, and sponsored content collide.

[Cue soft acoustic intro music – think ukulele and emotional Instagram reel.]

👩‍🦰 JAMIE (walks in holding a ring light and her phone):
Hi guys! I’m Jamie Otis, wife, mom, nurse, trauma survivor, emotional rollercoaster, and full-time influencer with a side hustle in crying on camera!

👨‍🦱 DOUG (enters holding a lukewarm coffee and a look of exhausted optimism):
And I’m Doug Hehner. I work in tech but no one remembers that because I’m mostly known as “Jamie’s emotionally stable prop.”

[They sit down on a love seat. Jamie immediately adjusts the pillows “for the aesthetic.” Doug just...sits.]

🛋️ JAMIE:
Today, we’re doing something super vulnerable and authentic…

[Doug flinches slightly.]

We’re ROASTING EACH OTHER… lovingly, of course. And also because our couples therapist told us passive-aggressive humor is better than full-blown resentment. Let’s go!

ROUND 1: PERSONALITY TRAITS

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Doug is the kind of man who could survive a zombie apocalypse just by politely apologizing to the zombies.
“Sorry I exist, here's my arm.”

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
Jamie’s Instagram captions are so long, I have to hydrate before I read them.
I once started one, took a nap, and woke up in a different fiscal quarter.

ROUND 2: PARENTING

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
Jamie thinks every toddler tantrum is a “healing moment.”
Meanwhile, I’m over here Googling “Can Goldfish crackers be a meal?”

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Doug's idea of parenting is just going, “Oh wow, babe, that sounds hard,” while handing me a diaper like it’s a peace treaty.

ROUND 3: ROMANCE

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Remember our wedding night? I cried because I didn’t know you —
and now I cry because I do. Full circle!

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
You cried on our honeymoon, our first vacation, and during our first IKEA trip. At this point, I think your love language is dehydration.

ROUND 4: SOCIAL MEDIA

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
Jamie can’t do anything without recording it. I once stubbed my toe and before I could scream, she was like:
“Hold up, babe, let’s do that again in natural lighting.”

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Doug is so offline, he thought “Reels” were something you fish with. I made him go viral once, and he asked if he needed antibiotics.

ROUND 5: MARRIAGE DYNAMICS

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Doug is like a golden retriever with a mortgage — loyal, sweet, slightly confused by confrontation.

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
Jamie’s like a beautiful hurricane made of hormones, essential oils, and childhood wounds.

[Sudden dramatic pause. Soft piano music plays.]

👩‍🦰 JAMIE (tearing up):
You know, even though we roast each other, I love that we keep showing up… for each other… and our followers.

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
I’d walk through fire for you, babe. Or at least through a 20-minute Live about cloth diapers.

🎤 ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Stay tuned next week for Jamie & Doug: Overshare Battle – Live Couples Therapy Edition, featuring guest judge: a slightly concerned licensed therapist!

📦 And don’t forget to use code ""TRAUMAHEALS20"" for 20% off your weighted blanket and emotional support diffuser.

It takes a long time to get back to sleep. Sometimes I even wake up more than once after falling asleep again. One night I woke up over 6 times. How is this even possible? It used to be that I would NEVER wake up in the middle of the night because it’s such a strong sedative, I used to tell my roommates to really shake me to wake me up if there’s an emergency.

This started happening when I was actually at 500mg but my psychiatrist and I believed it was drying me out so we went back down to 400mg but it didn’t help. Once we switched to 400mg he suggested I take melatonin to help adjust to the lower dosage. 

I feel like I’ve tried everything, making it cold in my apartment (I’m an extremely hot sleeper), not having a coffee in the morning, I take zyrtec for seasonal allergies, I have a humidifier, I have pretty good sleep hygiene and consistent sleep times/routines.

My psychiatrist referred me to the sleep clinic because he thinks I should be checked out for sleep apnea but the appointment isn’t until October. I always wake up feeling miserable now since my sleep is always interrupted every night.

Overweight all my life. PCOS for 15+ years. Earlier this year, my IBS worsened a lot, having almost daily abdominal pain and skyrocketing hypochondria anxiety when it did, and frequent insomnia. So I went on a low fodmap elimination diet for 30 days and had no relief. Heard about carnivore and specifically Lion through researching other elimination diets. Low fodmap did help some because I cut out a lot of grains & veg, I was already dairy free and gluten free 5+ years.

For the last seven days I have only eaten: beef, lamb, bison, beef tallow, Redmond salt, lots of water, and unsweetened electrolyte powder.

Pros: 
* Down 5 lbs 
* Down 1.5” waist circumference from when I started low fodmap
* steady energy all day despite cutting out coffee
* deep restful sleep, waking up 1-1.5 hours before my alarm fully alert
* big reduction in IBS pain
* excited and hopeful mood instead of feeling like I’m stuck in a broken body forever 

Cons: 
* still have daily abdominal pain, though not as severe and doesn’t spike anxiety 
* increased in frequency PCOS/ovary pain, though again not very severe 
* constipation (on fodmap I was pooping at least every other day) 
* sometimes stressful trying to figure out how to juggle my schedule to have compliant food 
* intense sugar cravings the first three days though these have diminished 
* initially struggled mentally while preparing food, but once I started eating it tasted good. On day 6 I actually started to enjoy it and salty beef tasted great. 
* grief at giving up my favorite foods 
* grief at giving up date lunch at restaurants with my husband
* fear/discomfort sharing my new eating plan with friends & family esp my MIL who thinks this is all nonsense I should just join weight watchers and walk 20k steps every day like her.

I’m planning to stay strict lion for at least the next week. I hope to add in egg yolks or bacon soon, maybe 2-3 weeks out. I’m waiting to be symptom/pain free for 3 days before I add anything else in. I would love to graduate to full carnivore eventually and then never look back!

It seemed like soy milk was my best option and especially the unsweetened version because because it had less carbs than the other milks.

-Used sandpaper to remove the shiny finish
-Scratched off the paint on the edges and made random ""natural scratches"" with a file
-Ran sports tape around the grips and then rubbed them with coffee grounds to get a dirty look without the feeling of dirt and a more permanent stained look

1m3kylc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creppypasta/comments/1m3kylc/possible_key_clue_in_case_of_disappearance/,Possible key clue in case of disappearance,"

There I was, trapped in a place that seemed soulless; always the same; from the coffee with the same flavor, the alarm that kills dreams at the same time, the colleagues who just see their lips articulate a word I want them to shut up. In short, I live trapped in the same miserable routine; I don't know what to do, I won't say my name, because I need you to have empathy for my situation, and that maybe there are souls who live the same situation as me.
Do you know? Sometimes I am afraid of the current situation of my environment; organized crime, missing persons and worse still, a government that seems to give a damn about the current situation of its people. I want my mother to recognize my achievements, not my belongings in a vacant lot. I am simply afraid of the unknown, I fear that I will escape from that tortuous routine and end up in a worse place, I fear that I will die without living.                                                                     
I write this as a therapeutic measure. Maybe writing my feelings in a notebook will make me feel better. Maybe I exaggerated my worries, but I have nothing else to do; Life is like a countdown, income, hunger, electricity, water and other things; you don't pay for them to be completed; but for them to restart.  
I will write what happens to me week by week, since I find writing daily tedious. Am I really someone who is too boring not to have a reason to write something daily? To be honest, I feel a relief when talking about my situation, I don't want to make my family uncomfortable with my nonsense; or at least I fear that they see my situation with those eyes.
Was adulthood supposed to be the best time of my life? I don't think so, this promises to go from bad to worse. I have no friends, I am separated from my family by hundreds of kilometers, I live chained to a job that I hate with all my soul, my mental and physical health is deteriorating little by little. I see people my age enjoying trips, luxuries, excessive parties; me too?  I live in an apartment that smells musty. I miss my adolescence. At least there I could dream. Sometimes I think about ending everything, although it won't change anything, it would just be a figure in millions.
The work is horrible. I can barely make ends meet, I certainly won't see myself with family in the near future, by some miracle I have a payment. The internship is something abusive for those who graduate from the university. Overtime is what gives me the pay I survive on; but at the same time they are killing me.
My co-workers are distant, the brotherhood within the work that they promised me was non-existent, sometimes I am the jester of that place; They take it out on me. Maybe it's just the unattainable expectations I grew up with back then. I feel like I've gone on long enough this week.
 
WEEK TWO:

There is nothing interesting, the same old thing; the abuse at my job by those idiots, I have resigned myself but it wouldn't hurt to have another intern here so they would leave me alone. We have started a project, in which; Thank God he didn't participate as much as usual, I'll finally get a break from this hell! Or at least that's what I was sorry for, because my boss used me as a janitor for the disgusting bathrooms, or as he calls it ""sanitary waiter."" It was horrible. 
And after? I go for walks at night as a hobby; It was something I used to do as children to appreciate the beauty of my surroundings, but here I see nothing but precarious neighborhoods, people who were once happy. Not everything is sadness, I also observed happy families, movie relationships and other things; that, apart from rejoicing; It made me feel empty.
WEEK 3:

The project at the company has finally finished, and with it my concierge service has gone. That martyrdom made me value my previous work a little, I feel really relieved; I also heard that the project was oppressive enough to break some of my peers, I just hope they don't take it out on me. 
I still continue with the hobby of walking. It's something that distracts me, I can spend hours investigating nearby places; Only, this time I have gone a little further than normal. I ended up in a neighborhood that seemed normal but I made a serious mistake, going through an alley. When I went out for a walk at night it was certain that one of these days I was going to be mugged; and curiously it was not like that. I only met a strange guy who offered me something of what he was eating, he really seemed like someone friendly; I accepted what he was inviting me to. He tasted good, afterwards we were talking to him. It was a pleasant talk, from there he invited me to a party, I accepted because he seemed like someone nice and they treated me to a piece of cake, something was wrong and I started to feel strange; as if it were flying, it was incredible. But the placebo effect was moderately long-lasting, around 40 minutes, from there I began to see not very pleasant things, things that I feared as a child that seemed adapted to my adulthood. Then I fainted. I don't know how I could feel that this shit could get better. Everything went there; My wallet, however, was empty; my card, although I already had five annual payments on me. I simply let this hobby, which, more than positive, breaks me even more.
WEEK 4:

Everything has been more screwed up for me. The rent has risen so that, chances are I won't make it to the end of the month. I guess the best thing would be to ask my boss for a raise and; He didn't help me, the unfortunate man told me that my payments as an intern were a miracle, with a smile that the only thing that made me think about was hitting him until his face disappeared. The vast majority of interns are not paid, he says. That shit felt like when I was little when I complained about the economic situation and my mother told me that there were people worse than us.
Faced with my imminent departure from my musty-smelling apartment, I decided to go for a walk to forget my situation; because I can't afford alcohol. I could die right there, I didn't care, until; I arrived at a very improvised house, not very big, it seemed like it was built recently, maybe it made sense to me; because I went far enough away that there were no people and I saw them there. Two people with foreign features; extremely pale skin, light black hair, and blue eyes. It seemed like they had enough melanin to waste it. I went at the expense of them being hostile and left it at that.

WEEK 5:

I was fired from my job after so much time sacrificing my physical and mental integrity, it is what they pay me with, a dismissal. I don't know what I'll do now, I've looked for a job and no one has wanted to give me one. I'm desperate not to know what's going to happen tomorrow.
I kept going to the place from before to observe the two strange people I saw that day. I started discreetly. Afterwards I became curious; Since they acted like cavemen, the only thing missing was their typical clothing. They hunted and other things that I will leave to your imagination. I didn't really find that behavior strange; foreigners looking for alternative experiences. Although they always disappeared into the forest around 4 pm, it is something rare but routine for them, they still return happier than normal. I feel mediocre spying on people on the outskirts, but I have nothing else to do. My job is lost and one of these days they are going to kick me out of my house.

WEEK 6:

Finally they took me out of that musty smelling apartment; That teenager's dream of success was tainted by a cruel world; the lack of understanding of what that recent college graduate was facing, meritocracy is a lie.
Having nothing better to do, what started as a hobby is now turning into a full-time job. Only, this time, those foreigners discovered me. I thought the worst, but they turned out friendly. They greeted me with rather clumsy Spanish, as if they had barely learned the basics or had escaped. They introduced themselves and told me their names, they seemed like an ordinary couple and, they were. They told me that they came from the land without a name (my suspicions that they came because of spiritual experiences were increasing at that moment); I didn't care much. I told them my name, my previous experiences and other things; I managed to see a little pity on their faces and when I got to the part where they kicked me out of the apartment, they asked me if I had a place to stay, I answered no; His expression became even more noticeable. Then I saw them whispering to each other, as if they were about to make an important decision and I could only hear, “Okay,” from that conversation. I really didn't know what was going to happen until one of them asked me, would you like to stay with us? Someone in their right mind would have thought about what their intentions were, but I had already lost everything and anything other than sleeping on the streets is better; so I accepted.
At first I wanted to help with the cleaning and everything related to it but they told me that chaos is the natural order and I didn't have to change it. They mentioned that today they were going to eat meat and I offered to go get it from the store, but they told me that those filth were not pure meat; but animals with millions of preservatives and chemicals; On the other hand, the true meat is what one hunts because not only is food obtained, the animal is also freed from this disgusting place where the dominated live. I immediately asked what the dominated are and they proceeded to give me a very long explanation that I can summarize in this: At the beginning of time Adam was the great work of God, he tried to recreate the same formula but this time feminine, her name was Lilith; She wanted to be autonomous from Adam but the divine rules did not protect Lilith, she ended up expelled from Eden and later, God created what they call a “mediocre replacement.” Lilith, upon learning of her replacement, felt a mixture of emotions, although she knew that she was going to act submissive to Adam because she was created according to his rib. It was then that Lilith tried to open the eyes of that replacement, she allied herself with the “serpent” to make it eat the fruit of good and evil so that it would acquire its own criteria, although it ended fatally, although it ate and so it was, it obtained its own criteria and was taken out of Eden, however, that wretch chose to remain dominated by its material of due reaction and be subdued instead of seeking its own freedom and autonomy. Really their objective is to return to the natural order, to put aside the disgusting authority, in short, to live according to our will and not lower ourselves to a greater power. In short, the dominated are the offspring of Eve.
At this explanation I was astonished; It is the typical story that I was told as a child, but with a somewhat strange twist. I thought they were going to use me for strange things because everyone was Eva's offspring, according to what they say, but they told me that there is a way to cleanse the blood of the dominated but to do so you must attend several meetings with the brotherhood, brotherhood?; I asked, surprised, yes, they answered in a coordinated way that was terrifying. So after eating they told me that the signal had arrived and that they had to go with the brotherhood, they took me without asking me to a place even further away where I was, about 2 hours walking, until I reached a place that did not match, it was something terrifyingly perfect but neglected, they were like the old Catholic churches, or as if it had been taken by force I decided to enter as I was practically in nowhere. When I entered, I walked for a while in its extensive corridor that invited me to enter its maw, it seemed to have no end and, halfway through it I saw a door closing, but I managed to see a stranger pulling a man who seemed to be hugged by a snake by the leg and despite having seen him briefly, I still remember his features, and when the corridor finally ended I saw something incredible (in the bad sense), hundreds of people gathered in this space, it was something disgusting, since having the philosophy that chaos is the natural order they did not have their own cleanliness, much less of that enormous place, if upon entering I noticed a strange smell, this was horrible, it was a lack of control until someone arrived, an inhuman silence invaded the place and began to speak, I did not understand anything until after half an hour when he began to speak in Spanish fleetingly, the only thing I understood was ""because of the useless replacement, several live in the monotony of submission to the authorities,” the language suddenly changed and that was how the entire meeting remained. It was a strange experience because when I blinked I felt as if I had fallen asleep, chance and that explains the sting I felt when walking down that hallway. As soon as I woke up I felt a strange sensation in my leg, even so I continued standing because what occupied all my attention was the putrid smell of that place, in some way I felt relieved, without thinking about how I would be able to eat the next day, as if all my regret had gone, as if I had been touched by a divine presence, it was liberating! At the end we were made to say goodbye to each of the “brothers” who had attended and despite greeting them all, I never saw the man who was hugging the snake's leg and the most disturbing thing, out of hundreds of people I barely saw a hundred.

WEEK 7:

Since that meeting my days have gone great, I feel alive, I feel with a genuine purpose to live, something alternative to the typical born, grow, study, work, marry, reproduce, die. 
One day I wanted to take a bath and I asked where they bathed. I used to go to a nearby stream but it seemed very laborious to go from there to here, so I decided to ask and they answered that chaos is the natural order, so I decided to go to the usual stream. I was practically drugged by them, I don't know what to do but I remembered that I got out of there for a reason, I was practically chosen by them. In the other meetings I have not been able to understand anything, sometimes and I usually understand one thing or another, but every time I understand something I record it, in a total of 10 meetings I have managed to put together a sentence; “because of the useless replacement, many live in the monotony of submission to the authorities, we are here to liberate, we are here to return to the natural order, we will cleanse the world of the blood of the dominated, we will return to the place where our lady came from”; I find the message somewhat beautiful, I come from being subjected by that system, I have been able to be freed from my chains, in exchange for what? In exchange for nothing, I had never heard of a purpose as noble as that of living according to our will. My relationship with strangers has improved a lot, they are no longer strangers, and despite that they have not agreed to tell me their names, they say they do not have any, lately I have not known anything about what is happening in the world, although it must be the same, sensationalism, murders, wars and so on; As long as I am with the brothers I don't need anything else. They have told me what happens when the brotherhood is blasphemed, they say that some suffered punishments comparable to their sin, but to give you an idea the most common thing is murder, in what way? They did not tell me (but considering that they are the closest thing to cavemen I don't want to imagine), I would be terrified but knowing that I have no reason to blaspheme the name of the holy brotherhood it does not worry me.
 
WEEK 8: 
I have been engaging in conversations with the few brothers who can speak Spanish, rarely the others cannot speak the language and the majority of those who can do so in a very archaic way; It is as if they had had to emigrate, or rather, escape. From the conversations I had with them, most of them have one characteristic, being at their worst moment, poorly paid work, poor communication with loved ones, horrible homes, in short: being in a vulnerable moment and being welcomed by our wonderful brotherhood. 
I have spoken little with that mysterious person who appeared at the meeting and put order in the first meeting I attended, from what I have investigated I know that he calls himself the “older brother”; He is like the bridge between us brothers and our mother, Lilith, I have talked to him sometimes. I have managed to talk to him only once, I asked his name and he told me that he has no comment that once you join the brotherhood you stop having a name, you know? It doesn't really matter because I don't even remember my name anymore; He comments that they go from country to country in search of those subjugated who seek to be free, through the meetings they see the potential of a few to be cleansed, those who are not, are taken to a last act of faith to find the way.
The hundreds of people have dropped to barely a hundred and from there I have only been able to notice a few dozen; The older brother says that some went to look for brothers, others found the way and others couldn't do it, I really don't know what ""finding the way"" refers to. I have noticed that the treatment that I had before has changed, from being friendly I can now see more hostile behavior; From becoming valuable, now I am nothing to them, the rules are increasingly absurd but deep down I realize that they have a very clear argument, they were proclaimed by the older brother based on conversations with our mother; The deals don't matter now because I am sure that I am in the middle of a test, my loyalty is worthy of being tested by the eldest brother and when it is finally over, my blood can finally be cleansed. 

WEEK 9:

Several meetings have passed, all the same, except that I haven't understood a single word, I really kept trying to understand them but I didn't even know what language they spoke in the first place (not that I know many languages).
I don't even know what I'm getting myself into, they're giving me very absurd rules, like not bathing. Once I tried to escape under the excuse of going for a walk, I arrived at a place that I previously saw as moderately populated and now, there are no people, everyone was missing, on the light poles there were signs of missing people, but instead of saying ""lost"", the word ""liberated"" was superimposed on it, the walls were full of vandalism, among what scared me the most was an inscription that said ""once marked by it you cannot escape"", I immediately remembered that strange mark of two fangs on my leg, I didn't know what to do, I simply ran until I felt that my legs were tearing from my body, finally I fell to the ground from exhaustion from doing such a thing, but what for me was an incredibly long distance was actually barely one street. Finally I woke up in the foreigners' house, according to them I was only asleep but the unbearable pain in my legs and their change of attitude towards me revealed something more than just a dream, from their kind looks I can only notice hatred in their eyes, they did not speak more after telling me that, it was a silence that apart from being inexpressive revealed more than just a few simple words. Thinking about it this way, maybe I didn't pass the test imposed by the older brother. They did not take long to head towards the brotherhood, curiously it was not yet four o'clock, I know this because today that signal so characteristic of that hour was not present; Finally we arrived at that place, this time there was a very noticeable change, instead of smelling things like sweat or signs of poor hygiene, today there was a penetrating smell of decomposition, I would have vomited except that we had not been able to hunt anything for two days. When we reached the center of that place, the brothers' looks were the same and their silence worried me. Finally, the older brother arrived saying that I made a serious mistake, because once marked by it, you cannot escape. Fortunately he said it was part of the test because not being able to stand being subjected I tried to seek my freedom, something our mother would also do. I am worthy of being cleansed, my cleansing ceremony will take place before the leap of faith to find the way, it is incredible to be here writing this at the expense of what is going to happen. I'll tell you about it next week.

The child came running out of the woods directly in front of my jeep. I slammed on the brakes, and the vehicle screeched to a halt about three feet away from him, headlight beams reflecting in his eyes.

Beside me, Deputy Erikson almost dropped a cup of coffee in his lap. Meanwhile, I was frozen in place, my fingers clutching the steering wheel for dear life, knuckles bulging against the skin.

""Is that the kid?"" Erikson asked.

Exhaling the tension from my body, I said: ""That's a kid, alright, but not the one we're looking for.""

I unfastened my seat belt and climbed out of the car. Slowly, as if approaching a wild animal, I walked towards the child with my hands raised in plain sight.

We were scouring the area for a missing girl. About six years old, auburn red hair, freckled face. Alys was her name. She’d been taken from a parking lot after one of her treatments. No one knew how.

The child in front of us, though, was a little boy, maybe eight to ten years old. Short, bedraggled brown hair, tan, and skinny as a beanpole.

There were leaves and twigs sticking out of the nest of his hair. Mud stained his bare feet. Small pink scratches adorned his arms and legs. For late October, the weather was too cold and windy to be wearing khaki shorts and a T-shirt. But if I had to guess, the temperature was the least of his concerns.

""Calm down now, son,"" I told him, ""we're not gonna hurt you.""

I could see it in his eyes. The teetering scales that resided within every person. That intrinsic response to perceived danger. Fight or flight? Stay or go?

The boy looked primed to run, but we were out in the middle of nowhere, standing on an endless stretch of asphalt. Last farm was about seven miles back, the next farm was probably another good seven miles ahead.

""Can you tell me your name?"" I asked. ""I'm Deputy Solanis with Halleran County Sheriff's Department. You can call me Raymond if you'd like, or Ray if that's easier.""

The boy stared at me with wide eyes. His pupils were dilated, eclipsing the whites. He parted his cracked lips and whispered: ""Thomas.""

""Thomas, that's a nice name. Can you tell me what you're doing out here, Thomas?""

The boy trembled with fear, wildly thrashing his head from side-to-side. ""Please! Please! Please! Don't send me back...I can't go back...don't make me."" He fell to his knees and sobbed. ""Hollow...men...bad...animals...in the trees...""

His head snapped up in my direction. There was a sudden stillness to him that made my heart drop. Like a lull during a thunderstorm, when the entire world goes quiet.

""The Fisherman is real,"" Thomas cried. ""He's in the trees! He'll come for me. They all will!""

Then, without warning, the boy fell flat onto the tarmac, unconscious. I rushed over to him and placed my fingers on his neck. There was a faint pulse present. From what I could discern there were no apparent cuts or broken bones. No indication of internal or external bleeding other than the few small scratches from running through bushes and other foliage.

I picked the boy up and returned to the jeep, setting him in the backseat. Taking my place behind the wheel, I spun the car around and headed towards the nearest hospital. About a twenty or thirty minute drive. But that's the Midwest for you. An archipelago of small towns isolated by an ocean of farms and forests. Rolling fields with a few riverbeds and streams interspersed.

While I drove, my foot heavy on the accelerator, my partner radioed the station with an update. Then, he called the hospital, told them to have a room and staff on standby for our arrival.

He hung the receiver on its cradle and peered into the backseat, a look of anguish upon his face. He muttered a soft prayer and turned in his seat, facing the front again.

""Son of a bitch,"" he muttered, glancing at the clock on the dash. ""I'm 'sposed to go trick-or-treating with Dany in about an hour.""

I checked the time. He was right. It was nearing the end of our shift. Getting anyone to willingly work a Saturday was tough. Convincing them to stay late was almost impossible. Of course, if the sheriff demanded it, there wasn't much they could do. At the same time, the sheriff was away on vacation, leaving me in charge.

""Tell you what,"" I said. ""Help me drop the kid off, and I'll let you get going for the night.""

""Are you sure?"" he asked, but there wasn't much in the way of sincerity. ""I'd hate to leave you high and dry.""

""I'll be fine. Didn't have plans anyway.""

""Oh, right..."" Erikson averted his gaze from me, once more looking back at the boy. ""Think he's from Sanguis?""

""Sanguis?""

""Yeah, closest town I can think of other than Baywater. But Baywater's about an extra twenty minutes from where we found him.""

""How far is Sanguis?""

""About eight minutes if you'd kept on the highway. Small gravel road that'll take you there.""

I nodded, storing the information away at the back of my mind. ""Sanguis, why haven't I heard of it?""

""Doesn't surprise me. Not many people have. They're a tight-knit community. Population can't be more than two thousand, if that. Only reason I know them is for their sweet corn.""

""What about it?""

""Just that it's pretty damn good. All their produce is. Since they're so far out, they have to take it to other markets and whatnot. But a few years back, they ran out of sweetcorn before I could get any. So, I asked the lady selling it for directions and went straight to the source. I'm tellin’ ya, stuff is out of this world. Dany and Lin go crazy over it.""

For the last few years, most of my dinners were plastic-wrapped and bought from a gas station. Couldn't remember the last time I'd gone grocery shopping for anything other than a six-pack and TV dinners. Maybe a frozen pizza if I was really hungry. But those days, my appetite was practically nonexistent.

We arrived at the hospital and carried the kid inside. Despite the holiday weekend, we were met by a number of nurses with a stretcher ready. Before I knew it, the boy was wheeled away, down the hall and around the corner. A doctor approached to question us, but we didn't have as many answers as he would've preferred. To be fair, I wasn't pleased about it either. Should've tried harder to get a full name or something concrete.

""How long do you think he’ll be under?"" I asked the doctor.

""Can't say until I've had a chance to examine him,"" the doctor admitted. ""The collapse could've been a result of extreme fatigue, malnutrition, mental strain, induced narcotics...I should be able to provide a better answer soon.""

My heart was racing, and my patience was burning. I couldn't stand the idea of waiting around, twiddling my thumbs, hoping everything would just land on my lap. Especially since we still had flyers to pass out for the missing girl.

""How 'bout this,"" I said, grabbing a pen and piece of paper from the front desk, ""I'll leave my personal cell and my partner's number. Kid wakes up, you call us. Until then, I'm gonna have a look around, see if I can't find the parents first.""

The doctor took the sheet of paper and nodded. ""Be careful out there tonight, Deputy. Full moon is a bad sign.""

""Well, I'm not one for superstitions, doc.""

We went back to the jeep, and I drove my partner home. His wife and son greeted me with excitable waves. The boy was dressed up as a scarecrow, and the mom in a white and blue dress with a little wicker basket.

""There's our tin man,"" she said as Erikson exited the vehicle. Then, she looked through the open passenger window at me. ""Y'know, we could still use a cowardly lion to round out the pack. You’re more than welcome to join us, Ray.""

""Would love to, Lin. 'Fraid I've got other plans though.""

""Oh?"" She cocked an eyebrow. ""Got a special date or something?""

Erikson nudged her with his elbow. She frowned in response. I recognized the signs of martial nonverbal communication well. An interesting thing to develop with someone. A language that can only be achieved after years and years of familiarity. I had that once, I like to think. But I was better at speaking it than interpreting it.

""I should be on my way,"" I said. ""Dany, get enough candy for the both of us, yeah?""

""We're gonna hit every house in town,"" the boy replied eagerly.

After that, I was back on the highway heading towards Sanguis. Overhead, the sun descended, gradually vanishing against the horizon. Black clouds billowed across the sky, wispy trails of ink that dispersed against the moon's unnatural glow. It was that time of year, the Hunter's Moon. When its white, snowy surface took on a pale orange hue and appeared about twice its normal size.

Along either side of the highway were thick patches of trees. Some with empty tops, their branches twisted like gnarled fingers. Others still retaining a mixture of red and brown leaves that swayed against the breeze.

I slowed down by mile marker ninety-six, crawling along the highway at a deliberate pace until my headlights spotted the gravel road Erikson told me about. Then, I turned off from the asphalt and followed the lane for another few minutes. It wasn't a long drive, but I was being cautious about deer or other wildlife. Nothing could ruin your day like a wild animal.

Rounding a bend, Sanguis appeared as if out of thin air. One second I was surrounded by dark forests and cornfields. Next thing I knew, there were dim street lamps and old brick buildings with vines wrapped around them like spiderwebs. Cookie-cutter houses of this era, greatly contrasted by the outdated shops along main street. Each one built directly beside each other, shoulder-to-shoulder because back in the day, no one really knew just how big a town could become. Everything was grouped together for convenience.

I had to pull off from main street along a backroad due to a line of barricades. It seemed the town was holding a Halloween festival. And with the overcrowded sea of cars, it looked as if everyone and their moms were in attendance.

I found a parking spot on a muddy field in between a Ford Puma and a Lincoln. I got on the radio to let the dispatcher know of my whereabouts and to see if there were any updates about the boy. So far, they hadn't heard anything. Just to be sure, I checked my phone, but I was too far out in the boonies for cell reception.

""Go figure,"" I muttered, pocketing my phone and stepping out from the jeep. I locked the car and started my trek for the only part of town that had any discernible sign of life.

In all my years, I'd never seen such spirited enthusiasm for Halloween. I've encountered some interesting costumes, attended a few lively parties, but Sanguis was on a completely different level.

Almost everyone wore a costume, and no outfit was the same. There were a few modern pop culture references. Kids dressed up as their favourite cartoon characters and superheroes and whatever else was popular to them. Adults varied in that some donned scarier outfits and makeup to appear as ghosts and ghouls and zombies. Some, mainly the younger crowd, were dressed in a more attractive fashion. Then, of course, there were a handful of people that didn’t bother with more than their everyday clothes.

I shouldered my way through the crowd, trying to ask about the boy, but I was consistently ignored. I imagine many mistook my uniform for a costume, and considering my age, they wanted nothing to do with me. I was just a middle-aged man with a tired face and sad eyes. Unruly hair partnered with faint stubble that was in an awkward phase between beard and clean-shaven. My only advances had been blind dates organized by mutual friends. But I didn’t have many acquaintances outside of work.

However, after enough searching, I was able to speak with a few of the locals. With the provided information, some had possible answers, but Thomas was a common name. Not to mention, many of the locals willing to speak with me were already inebriated and struggled to comprehend what I was asking. The music blaring through overhead speakers scattered about main street wasn't making my job any easier either.

There was nothing I could do about the festival, as much as I wanted to. I couldn't just make demands to shut it down or halt its progress. Sanguis wasn't within my county, and therefore, I had little say. I should've called someone to aid me, someone working within their jurisdiction, but I was impatient. Eager for answers.

Eventually, someone dressed as a sad-faced clown pointed to a nearby diner and told me I should speak with the mayor. I thanked them and went on my way.

Inside, the diner was packed from wall-to-wall. Every booth was filled, every stool taken, every inch of counter space occupied by food and drinks. The distinct scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, intermingled with the smell of cooked bacon grease and oil from an air fryer.

""Sorry, hun."" A hostess in a black apron had snuck up on me, appearing from a small cluster of girls dressed as vampires. ""There aren't any tables right now. Wait time will be about ten to twenty minutes. Maybe longer.""

I leaned in and asked: ""Is the mayor here?""

The woman looked me up and down, studying my face. ""Oh, you're not from around here.""

""That obvious, huh?""

""I've got an ear for accents and a memory for faces. 'Specially one as handsome as yours.""

She was lying in hopes of getting a tip.

""You wouldn't happen to know of a little boy named Thomas, would you?” I asked. “Younger, between eight and ten. Brown hair. Blue eyes.""

""Might be Tommy Milner. His daddy has a farm up the road.""

""Sweet corn?""

Her lips twisted with amusement. ""Sheep and pigs mostly.""

""Right,"" I said. ""Now, about the mayor...""

She turned and pointed to a booth at the back of the restaurant. A man in a suit sat alone. Darker skin, curly black hair cut short, quiet but seemingly amicable as he politely nodded or waved at a few other patrons passing by on their way for the side exit.

""Thanks a bunch."" I left the hostess and maneuvered the crowd until I stood before the mayor's table. ""Got a moment?""

He looked up from his half-eaten meal. His eyebrows knitted together with consternation. ""Do we know each other, friend?""

I extended my hand. ""Raymond Solanis; deputy sheriff from Halleran County.""

A charming smile lifted the mayor's lips, revealing a set of pearly-white teeth. A politician's grin. Warm, attractive, but not so defined as to appear creepy or intense. Small lines around the corners of his mouth said he must've donned it often.

""Mayor Michael Briggs."" He grasped my hand firmly and shook it. ""Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Please, have a seat. Are you hungry? Best bacon this side of the river.""

Best bacon and sweet corn, I thought. What can't you people do?

""No,"" I said, ""but thank you.""

He nodded and lifted a cup of coffee to his mouth. ""I like your costume.""

""You do realize I'm actually a deputy sheriff, right?""

""And I'm dressed up as the very handsome mayor of Sanguis.""

""Doesn’t really seem like a costume to me.""

""Of course it is."" The mayor grinned. ""You and I are nothing more than men. This, the clothes we wear and the business we conduct, are roles in a play. The world is a stage, my friend, and we are simply trying to give our best performance before the curtain inevitably falls.""

I had to wonder if it wasn't just coffee in the mayor's cup.

""The reason I'm here,"" I explained, ""is about a boy my partner and I found on the highway. Might be a local from your town. Tommy Milner?""

""Ah, Tommy. Kind young man. Hard worker. You say you found him on the highway?""

I quickly recalled the day's earlier events. How the boy came running out of the woods barefoot and afraid. As if he were being chased.

""I see."" The mayor rubbed his hand along the length of his jaw. ""Is he okay?""

""He's being treated at a hospital about half an hour from here. I was hoping to get in contact with the parents, verify the boy’s identity.""

""You and your partner?""

""Just me."" I don't know why, but then I said: ""Partner's on standby at the hospital. Waiting for any updates.""

The mayor took another sip of his coffee as he considered this. There was a hint of distress in his eyes as if he were trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces. Bemused by the news given to him.

""Well, Deputy, I can't say I've heard from the Milners. Then again, it has been a busy day with the festival. Why don't we take a ride up to the farm and check in on them?""

""I would appreciate that, Mayor.""

He collected his coat from the booth and rose to his feet. I followed closely behind him. As we neared the main entrance, he stopped and whistled.

Somehow, through the bustle of the diner, a woman at the far end of the counter perked up and met the mayor's gaze. She stood from her stool, threw down a twenty dollar bill on the counter, and joined us outside.

It was then I got a better look at the woman. Lithe frame and hard jaw. Steely eyes with an indifferent expression. She wore a black police button-up beneath a Kevlar vest.

""Deputy Solanis, meet Officer Katherine Barsad,"" the mayor introduced. “She’s our local law enforcement.”

""Kat,"" she said curtly.

I tried to shake her hand, but the mayor was already on the move, and she was quick to keep up with him.

We all piled into Officer Barsad's cruiser and drove deeper into town, past the buildings and streets onto a muddy road that led us to the countryside. The trees returned but swiftly gave way to endless fields of corn.

""You know, Deputy,"" said Mayor Briggs, ""it seems strange for you to be all the way out here.""

""Lucky that I was, otherwise young Tommy might still be walking the highway.""

The mayor glanced over at me in the passenger seat, still awaiting some sort of explanation.

""I was going around handing out flyers for a missing girl, Alys,” I said. “Trying to raise awareness; see if I couldn’t shake something loose.”

""Correct me if I'm wrong, but they have Amber Alerts and news channels for that, don't they?""

""Smaller communities aren't alway fully connected to the network. And I've got me something of a restless mind. Need to keep busy.""

""Workaholic or guilty conscience?""

Instinctually, I tensed at the question. In the backseat, Officer Barsad shifted her body to face me. It was then I realized just how cramped the car was, and how strange it'd been for the officer to relinquish the driver's seat to the mayor. Then again, he was technically her boss. But in my experience, whenever I was with the sheriff, he always rode shotgun.

""You know why they call this town Sanguis?"" the mayor asked. ""Back in the late 1800s, around the civil war, there was a battle here. You see for a time, Missouri was considered a border state. You know what a border state is?""

""When the state's loyalty was divided between the Confederacy and the Union. Neither fully one or the other.""

""Very good, Deputy."" He raised his eyes to look at Officer Barsad in the rearview mirror. ""We've got a learned man in our midst.""

We turned off the road and started up a long winding lane towards a plain farmhouse with a sloped roof. The yard light was off, and the inside of the house was dark.

""The battle was as bloody as they get,"" Mayor Briggs continued. ""Brothers against brothers, fathers against sons. In fact, there’d been so much bloodshed, it soaked into the dirt and turned the waterways red for a time. It almost caused the town to collapse completely, but where there's a will there's a way.""

""And that connects to Sanguis how?""

We came to a stop in the empty driveway. The mayor turned towards me, the leather of his seat squeaked with his movements. ""Sanguis is the Latin word for blood. Not our proudest moment but perhaps our most defining.""

Slowly, under the cover of the shadows, I slid my right hand across my body, resting it on my revolver. ""Is that so?""

There was a hint of disappointment in the mayor’s smile. ""Unfortunately."" Then, he unbuckled his seatbelt and exited the car. ""Are you coming?""

I opened my door and stepped out, Officer Barsad lingered a few paces behind us. A spectator in this investigation. Easy to forget if you weren’t careful.

We followed the cobblestone path to the porch and knocked on the front door. There was no response, so we knocked again. The mayor called out to the Milners, alerting them of his presence. Still, nothing.

""What do you think, Deputy?"" the mayor asked. ""Should we get a warrant? I imagine it might be difficult for you considering county lines.""

I looked back at Officer Barsad. ""Suppose I should let you take the lead.""

She remained still, her eyes going to Briggs for instruction. He nodded lightly, and she stepped forward, trying the handle. The door swung open to darkness and the smell of honey ham.

I removed a flashlight from my belt. Officer Barsad did the same. We entered the house, our beams of light crawling across the floorboards and walls. I kept my right arm rested on the grip of my revolver, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

In the hallway, I found a picture hanging on the wall. It was a family photo of the Milners. Mother, father, and son. The boy was the very same I'd encountered on the highway.

Suddenly, the overhead lights came on. Mayor Briggs stood with his finger still on the switch, grinning at me with a sense of pity.

""Keep your eyes on the sky,"" he said, ""and you'll trip over the roots beneath your feet.""

We turned off our flashlights and wandered the house, calling out to the Milners. There was no sign of life, no sign of a disturbance either. The house sat empty and still, untouched. Then, as I returned from the hallway, I stopped in the dining room. The dinner table was set with three plates, the food on each plate partially eaten. Something had interrupted their supper and forced them to abandon their home halfway through a meal. No time to clean up, no time to pack, no time to do anything but leave. Where had they gone? What made them leave so suddenly?",0,1752891919.0,creepcast,0,0.5,False
