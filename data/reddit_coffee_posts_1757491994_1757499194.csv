Life gets heavy. Nights get louder than days. And sometimes, all you want is comfort. Not advice, not solutions just that safe, quiet, warm space where you can exhale without explaining yourself.

That’s where the idea of an online cuddle buddy comes in.
Not some awkward half-baked thing. Not another flaky “wyd lol” situation. I mean real, intentional, consistent comfort.

How It Works (Our Version of Cuddling)

Since the internet robs us of actual hugs, we get creative:

Cuddle Calls/VCs: We hop on video or voice calls, wrap ourselves in blankets, dim the lights, and just exist. You on your side of the screen, me on mine, but the energy? Shared.

Cuddle Playlists: We swap songs that feel like warm blankets. Could be lo-fi beats, soft indie, movie soundtracks, or guilty-pleasure ballads.

Silent Cuddles: Sometimes words are too much. So we just mute ourselves, stay connected, and do our own thing—reading, sketching, gaming, or staring at the ceiling. Just knowing someone’s there is enough.

Cuddle Text Sessions: Sending random “you good?” check-ins, comfort memes, or soft quotes. Nothing fancy, just little nudges that say: hey, you’re not alone.

Themed Nights: Pajama cuddles, tea/coffee cuddles, rainy-day sound cuddles, even chaotic “we’re cuddling while ranting about bad movie plots” nights.


Cuddling here isn’t about perfection. It’s about presence. About being each other’s safe pause button when life feels like it’s moving too fast or not at all.


---

Who I Am

I’m 26, a doctor, a nerd, and a human mess in progress.
I read comics like they’re scripture, question time like it’s a stubborn patient, and sometimes stay up at 3 a.m. just… feeling everything too much.

I don’t believe in shallow connections. I’m wired for depth, for messy conversations that start with “what’s your comfort food?” and end with “do you think souls recognize each other across lifetimes?”

And yes, I’ll bring chai to our cuddle sessions. Virtual chai, but still counts.


---

What I’m Looking For

Someone who gets that “cuddling” here is about emotional warmth, not just pixel proximity.

Someone who can laugh at dumb jokes but also sit in comfortable silence.

Someone consistent not ghosting for days then reappearing like a badly written plot twist.

Someone who doesn’t need to have it all figured out, but is willing to show up, as they are.


You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to be real.


---

Why?

Because at the end of the day, we’re all just souls stumbling through chaos, craving connection that feels like home. And maybe, just maybe, an online cuddle buddy could be the weird little lifeline we didn’t know we needed.


---

So if you’re reading this and your chest feels a little warmer, or your brain goes “same,” send me a blanket emoji, a cozy song, or just a “hi.”

And let’s see if two people on different screens can still create a space that feels like a hug.

Because comfort doesn’t always have to be physical.
Sometimes, it’s just knowing someone’s really there.

1nda4y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/over60/comments/1nda4y7/scars_from_two_agegap_heartbreaks/,Scars from Two Age-Gap Heartbreaks,"Hey everyone, I’m 34F and I’ve been dipping my toes back into dating after what feels like a lifetime of ups and downs. I know this subreddit is for old men, and honestly, that’s what draws me here. I’ve always found myself gravitating toward guys who are a bit older, more seasoned, the kind who seem to have that quiet wisdom that comes from living through the storms. But I have to be real with you all: my heart’s been through the wringer, and I’m sharing this because maybe it’ll help someone understand where I’m coming from.
Let me take you back a few years. I was 28, fresh out of a messy breakup with a guy my age who just couldn’t commit, and I met this man. He was 52, divorced, with that salt-and-pepper hair and a laugh that made my stomach flip. We connected at a coffee shop near my old base he was reading some beat-up novel, and I struck up a conversation about it. Turns out he was a history teacher, loved talking about the past, and for the first time in forever, I felt seen. Not just as a young woman, but as someone with dreams and fears. We started dating, and it was like nothing I’d experienced dinners where he’d share stories from his travels in Europe before kids and mortgages tied him down, walks in the park where he’d hold my hand like it was the most natural thing. He made me feel special, like I was the missing piece in his quiet life.
But here’s where it gets heavy. About six months in, things shifted. Mark’s ex-wife started reaching out more, custody stuff with his teenage daughter, and suddenly I was the “other woman” in his eyes not literally, but that’s how he treated me. He’d cancel plans last minute, blame stress from work or family, and when I’d push back gently, he’d snap, saying I was too young to understand real responsibilities. One night, after a particularly bad argument where he accused me of being “clingy” just for wanting to spend a weekend together, he dropped the bomb: he wasn’t ready for anything serious. Just like that, after I’d opened up about my own family issues. My dad passing when I was 13, leaving me with this void of not having a steady male figure, I was out. He ghosted me for weeks, then sent a text saying it was “for the best” because I deserved someone my age. It crushed me. I spent months questioning everything: Was I too naive? Too eager? Did I misread all those late-night talks as something deeper?
Fast forward, and it’s not just him. There was another guy a couple years later, He was 48, who I met through friends. Charming as hell, ran his own small business, and at first, it was electric weekend getaways, him surprising me with little gifts that showed he listened. But same pattern: the compliments turned to subtle digs about my “youthful energy” wearing him out, and when his buddies started joking about the age difference at a barbecue, he laughed it off but pulled away. Ended with him saying he needed space to “figure out his life,” leaving me feeling used, like I was just a fun distraction from his midlife routine. It hurt so bad because I wasn’t looking for a fling; I wanted that stability, that mentorship mixed with real affection that older guys sometimes bring. But twice now, it’s felt like they saw me as temporary, something to spice up their world before retreating back to their comfort zones.
I guess what I’m saying is, these experiences left scars. They made me wary, made me build walls around my heart because opening up to someone older means risking that power imbalance—the way they can walk away and leave you doubting your worth. But I’m here because I still believe not all stories end that way. Are there older men who’s past the games and ready for something real—maybe start with coffee, deep conversations, and see if we click without the drama. Someone who can show me that age gaps don’t have to mean heartbreak.",1,1757498811.0,over60,0,1.0,False

My GF 25F (let's call her Pam) and Me 25M have been together for 1 year. During this time of course I met  her best friend 24F let's call her Sel. For context: I'm from the west coast and they're from the east coast. We live in the east coast like half an hour away by car from their city.  For complicated reasons Pam went to another country for 2 months. Also I just want to mention that I'm total love with Pam and I don't think Sel would be attracted to me so cheating or any romantic interest is out of the question. The thing is she seems so nice and friendly with me (which I'm happy with after all I don't want my gfs friend to hate me). Every time we hang out she insists on stretching the time so we can talk more and she's the one proposing most of our hangout (like going for coffee etc..). She checks in on me asking how I'm doing and that if I need to get something I should pass by her place. We also starting confiding in each other (I trust my gf more obviously so not anything that I already didn't tell my gf).

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

1nd9xi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nd9xi3/is_it_drinking_coffee_the_same_as_not_drinking/,Is it drinking coffee the same as not drinking?,"Let me explain. Let's say you never drank coffee regularly . Just some rare time you took an energy drink to boost an especially groggy day.

However, now you start taking 3 cups of coffee a day every day. At first you feel all the amazing energy benefits and motivation, but as time goes by the body creates a resistance to that amount of caffeine consumed.

So after 1 year drinking 3 cups of coffee you don't feel energized anymore, you just feel normal. Now, thanks to that created resistance to feel normal again you need 3 cups of coffee when, before, you needed none.

If you want to obtain the energy effects of coffee you now need 5 cups of coffee. Until the body creates resistance again and you are back at square one.

Thus, the only way out of the loop is by quitting coffee entirely and let your body reset your resistance levels.

After some months you can occasionally drink only 1 coffee or 1 energy drink to feel energized again and avoid of getting into the loop again.
-----------------------------------------
This is my understanding of the problem with the energy levels and resistance of the body.

I was intrigued by the promise of bold pigments, velvety matte textures, and nourishing glosses, all wrapped in shades that cater to a variety of moods and occasions. With its mini, travel-friendly sizes and vegan, cruelty-free formula, this set seemed like an ideal option for adventurous makeup lovers or someone seeking the perfect holiday gift.

**Design and Packaging**  
The first thing I noticed about this mini lipstick trio was its thoughtful packaging. Compact and sleek, the outer packaging is both aesthetically pleasing and functional, making it easy to slip into your travel bag or handbag. Inside, the curated mini sizes offer a deep berry (Rich Auntie), a bold blue-red (Bawse Lady), and a champagne shimmer lip gloss (Trophy Wife). The sizes are deliberate—perfect for those like me who rarely finish a full-sized product yet enjoy experimenting with different shades! The doe-foot applicators for both the liquid lipsticks and gloss ensure precise application for sharp and evenly saturated lines.

**Texture and Formula**  
I was eager to test the promised velvety matte finish, and the liquid matte lipsticks didn't let me down. Both Rich Auntie and Bawse Lady applied like a dream, with a silky, smooth glide that dried down to a matte texture without feeling uncomfortably tight on my lips. That alone is a rarity in matte lipsticks! The non-sticky lip gloss impressed me as well with its lightweight formula enriched with argan oil, olive oil, and vitamin E. Having dry lips, I often struggle with products that exacerbate this, but the gloss provided not just a stunning shine but also long-lasting hydration.

**Ease of Application**  
Using this product is as straightforward as it gets. I applied the matte shades, starting from the middle of my lips and gliding outward for flawless color distribution. The doe-foot applicator helped me achieve clean and polished edges, which is essential when wearing bold lip colors. Adding the Trophy Wife gloss on top not only elevated the look but also ensured my lips stayed hydrated without becoming sticky—a balance many lip products fail to strike.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact packaging perfect for traveling or gifting  
- Rich pigments deliver bold shades suitable for different occasions  
- Hydrating ingredients in the gloss keep lips comfortable all day  
- Matte lipstick formula feels smooth, not drying  
- Vegan, cruelty-free, and inclusive – ideal for different complexions

**Longevity and Wear**  
During an entire day of errands, meetings, and endless coffee cups, I was particularly surprised at the staying power of the liquid matte lipstick. The pigmentation didn’t fade noticeably, and the color clung on remarkably well without any cracking. While the gloss required some reapplication (as most do), it’s worth noting that it didn’t smear or turn excessive when layering back over the matte lipsticks. If you plan a long day with eating, drinking, or talking, a small touch-up session might still be needed, but overall, I’d call this set long-wearing for the price point.

**Areas of Concern**  
- The small size might not work for someone who prefers full-size products  
- Lipstick shades are bold and might not cater to those looking for subtler tones  
- Limited shades within the set; users seeking a broader palette might look elsewhere  

**Competitors**  
Comparing this set to other mini lip trios, like Fenty Beauty's lip products or Maybelline's travel-friendly kits, I found The Lip Bar’s offerings stood out for its unique blend of boldness and comfort. Products from competitors, like Fenty, may come with broader shade ranges, but they often lack the same hydrating properties The Lip Bar offers. Drugstore options like Maybelline make their mark with affordability, yet they don’t quite match the non-toxic, vegan standards this set delivers. For users looking to balance skin-safe formulations with performance, this set strikes the perfect middle ground.

**Quality for Price**  
When you consider the travel-friendly sizes, premium blend of safe and nourishing ingredients, and high pigmentation, this product offers excellent cost efficiency. While it may seem like a small splurge compared to regular drugstore brands, the performance delivers far more value. Plus, the inclusion of gift-ready packaging and unique shades makes it especially appealing as a treat for yourself or a thoughtful present for a loved one.

I’ve been creeping on this sub, stealing your hacks for dodging procrastination like a pro. Time to pay it back with something I cobbled together: Clarily, a bare-bones web app I just launched to help you figure out why the hell you’re hyped about an idea before you burn hours on it. I’m building this thing out in the open (peep my [https://x.com/vida994](https://x.com/vida994) for the chaos), and I need your brutal feedback. Lay it on me.

What’s Clarily?

Ever get all messed up about a project, then bail when you realize your “why” was weaker than gas station coffee? Clarily’s here to stop that. You type an idea, it hits you with three “Why?” questions to dig out your real reason, then you decide if it’s worth your time. Hit Enter to keep going, Esc to bail. If it’s a keeper, add a first step, and it’s saved to a no-frills dashboard. Done. No bloat, no distractions.

Why it’s for you:

This app’s for anyone stuck in “too many ideas” hell (yep, that’s me). It forces you to get real about what’s driving you, so you don’t waste energy on shiny nonsense. It’s free, no signup BS, your ideas just chill in your browser’s localStorage. Want fancy extras like voice input or AI spitting out a two-week plan? You’ll need an account with just an email, but the main deal is free, no catch.

The gritty truth:

It’s an MVP, slapped together with Loveable and Cursor, hosted at Vercel. It’s rough, keyboard navigation might choke on crusty browsers, and bugs are probably lurking. I’m one dude, not some tech giant, so I need your help to iron out the kinks. Try it at [https://clarily.app/](https://clarily.app/), and tell me what’s dope, what’s trash, or what’s missing. I want it simple but useful.

Why I’m here:

This sub’s all about tools and tricks to get stuff done, so I’m tossing Clarily into the mix. I’ve seen you all hype tools like WillTimeFitApp and deep-dive motivation posts, so I hope this fits. If I’m screwing up the sub’s rules, school me. I’d rather learn than get kicked to the curb.

First things first. I feel a bit let down. By the phrasing that caramelly has on their website.

I had wishlisted the Outin nano from [caramelly.in](http://caramelly.in) a few months ago. Since my travels has become a bit more frequent, I decided to place an order. Visited [caramelly.in](http://caramelly.in) searched for outin and placed an order for the gift set with the outin bag.

It's primarily my mistake. I should have noticed it better. But this is how it shows up when you search for outin on their website. And the case is OutIn. Didn't think twice and placed an order.

Okayish crema. The coffee tasked a bit acidic than my Breville. Definitely very drinkable. Decently hot(forgot to measure the temparature).

Still a bit disappointed that this isn't the outin nano.

I’m going to share the exact process I used to make this happen, it's the same process that’s helped me and others go full-time from our passion.

With 3 things:

1. Getting the right attention
2. Creating real connections
3. Having a clear offer

I thought about it: If someone wanted coffee, they'd go to the coffee store. (so the desire already exist). All I had to do is get the right attention.

With this same concept, that's how I thought about building a community. I created a space where people who already knew what they wanted can hang out.

Then I started building real connections having conversations in the comments, posts, and DMs. Because I was in the right place, getting the right attention became natural.

And since I was solving problems they already had, people were genuinely interested and ended up joining my group.

Finally, I made sure I had a clear message, showing people exactly what they could achieve. That clarity removed friction, built trust, and ultimately grew my group past 200 members.

I started getting messages like ""what are the next steps"". The people who wanted extra attention to achieve that dream outcome would pay.

Ever really thoutht about how we're all just like ants on this great big rock, scurrying around and trying to figure out what the heck we're doing? I read somewhere that even stars like to talk to one another on occasion, whispering across the cosmos. Okay, mybe not literlaly, but isn't it kinda neat to think they might?

Sometimes, I sit with my coffee and just wonder abut connection... how we're all wvoen into this vast network of life, but often miss those threads because we're too caught up in the detaios. Maybe if we stopped for a moment and gazed at the nibht sky more often, we'd noyice just how wonderfully tangled we all are in this cosmic quilt.

So here's a thought for today: what if our purpose is simply to observe and appreciate? To take a step back, breathe, and let go of the need to untangle everything right away. Maybe it's less about finding the right path and more aboout enjoying the detours we take along the way. 🌌

I normally plan my outfits in Indyx during my morning coffee and chill routine but was feeling pretty uninspired so I didn't come up with anything. Instead I decided to freestyle it and let myself be drawn to whatever was calling to me. It started with the orange pants mostly because I haven't worn them in a while and love how comfortable they are. The slouchy fit can look a little sloppy for work if I'm not careful so I went with a simple cami and a black blazer to bring in some seriousness. This felt too serious so I tried on the sheer black top as an added layer. I loved it as an unexpected element and instantly thought of Mysterious' purple and orange combo. To play with the sheerness theme, the sheer purple socks was the right move to tie everything together and bring in more interest and fun. I loved how this turned out and really enjoyed looking down at my socks throughout the day.

The Andes stretched endless and jagged, like the broken teeth of the world. Their jagged crowns rose black against stormlight, while a Douglas DC-6 rattled its way through the passes like a fly in a bottle.

Inside the cabin, the crew wore the faces of the tired and the unwilling. Rudy had taken the controls, tail coiled around the yoke as her claws twitched against the dials. Faraday, strapped into the engineer’s chair, muttered about “magnetic anomalies” and “storm interference,” the words tumbling as nervously as his hands. Minx sharpened her claws against the seat armrest, each scrape a warning of the nerves underneath. Professor Featherstone sipped tea, unflinching, as though no disaster in human—or avian—history had ever been worth missing a sip.

And Mouse Capone? He chewed a cigar he couldn’t light in a cabin that might soon be his coffin.

“I told you,” he growled, smoke-less and bitter. “South American contracts are cursed.”

The mountain answered with a wall of wind and a spear of lightning. The plane screamed as metal met air it was never meant to touch. The ground rushed up like the end of a sentence.

Impact.

---

They woke scattered in the wreckage. The world had become white noise—snow falling, wind wailing, the silence of things broken. The Douglas lay half-buried on a ridge, its fuselage cracked open like a ribcage.

The crew dragged themselves inside, huddled in the torn belly of the plane. Breath fogged the air. Coats and blankets patched the holes. A poker deck was burned for warmth.

Days passed. Rations shrank. Coffee grounds were boiled into black water; a stale loaf of bread was passed like a relic. Minx whispered ghost stories to keep their eyes from the dark. Blue Puppy whimpered at the walls, ears low, nose twitching at something they wouldn’t name.

And Mouse sat silent, watching the horizon.

---

On the fifth day, the talk began.

“We could build an ice condenser,” Faraday stammered, sketching circuits in the frost.
“Could chase alpaca,” Rudy said, her voice low, eyes already measuring the white distance.
“Could eat Professor,” Minx joked, and was met with a growl from Blue Puppy that cut the humor short.

The Professor had been staring into the rear cargo hold, where Syndicate agents lay frozen, dart scars still visible on their necks. He spoke softly, as though reciting a catechism:

“Survival accounts are clear. In the Andes, the cold takes the body, but the living... the living must decide how much of their soul they’ll feed to the snow.”

Nobody spoke. Nobody breathed. The truth had landed.

Mouse lit his cigar at last, flame flickering blue in the dark. He exhaled, and the smoke carried his words like a verdict:

“If it comes to carving, I’ll be the one holding the knife. Nobody else carries that weight.”

---

The storm that night rattled the fuselage. Shadows flickered. Hunger broke through hesitation.

It wasn’t described, not in detail. Just glimpses: Minx’s trembling hand, Rudy’s wrench snapping bone mistaken for timber. The fire’s hiss when fat spat into the flames. Faraday turning away, retching into his sleeve. Blue Puppy whimpering but staying close, as though warmth mattered more than innocence.

The Professor bowed his head in prayer, but the words never carried.

Mouse said nothing, chewing ash, eyes black.

---

The storm broke with morning. Clear skies rang with the drone of engines: search planes, hunting the wreckage.

The crew stumbled into daylight, gaunt-eyed and hollow, but alive. They were hauled into helicopters, wrapped in blankets, carried down from the ridge like ghosts given flesh again.

Weeks later, in Philadelphia, the questions came. Reporters swarmed the safehouse, microphones flashing.

“How did you survive?”
“What kept you alive in the mountains?”
“What did you *eat*?”

Mouse tipped his hat, cigar dangling from his lips, gaze hidden beneath the brim.

“Trade secret,” he said.

And the flashbulbs went off, never knowing what the crew carried in their eyes.

Search engines relied on exact-match terms, so repeating phrases like “best shoes 2009” boosted visibility. Website design, speed, and user experience had little influence at the time. The focus was almost entirely on keyword density. Though simplistic by today’s standards, the method was effective. It also set the groundwork for the more advanced SEO strategies that followed.

Now? Search has evolved into this weird predictive AI machine that doesn’t just *read* words, it tries to *understand* intent. I can type “that one show with the coffee shop and sarcastic people” and it instantly knows I mean *Friends*.

It’s impressive, sure, but also a little unsettling. We went from manipulating Google with caveman tactics to being quietly manipulated by Google’s algorithm. The internet grew up with us, but honestly… it might’ve gotten a little too smart for its own good.",1,1757497390.0,seogrowth,0,1.0,False

Three months ago, I was sitting in traffic, late to a job I didn’t love, staring at brake lights and wondering how I got here. I don’t know what came over me that day, but when I got home, I sat down and started browsing RV listings. I’d never owned one. Never even driven one. But something in me knew I needed a change.

Fast forward to now—I'm writing this from a quiet lakeside spot in Northern Idaho. My little Class C may not be fancy, but it’s mine. I’ve already learned more in 90 days than I have in years: how to manage power and water, where to find the best hidden camping spots, how to make coffee taste just right over a campfire.

Most importantly, I’ve learned how peaceful life can be when you slow down.

To anyone out there feeling stuck or on the fence: that one random Tuesday that made me snap? It might have been the best thing that ever happened to me. Life on the road isn’t perfect, but it’s *real*, and every day feels like it matters now.

1nd9p7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nd9p7k/ghosting_aftermath_a_woman_from_my_past_has/,Ghosting aftermath: A woman from my past has contacted my wife under a disguise,"TL;DR I misled a woman who I have known for years and she has contacted my wife. I have issues with ghosting and communication and that is partially to blame for the mess I am in now.

In 2007, I met a woman, Summer, on a dating site.  We had a casual relationship but I knew she wanted something serious.  For various reasons, I could not/was not ready to commit.  She was childless (like me), gainfully employed, educated, and owned her own condo.  I admired her and enjoyed being with her.  Five years later in 2012, I  ghosted her after she initiated another conversation around our relationship status.  I am sure it was hurtful to her.  I had a history of running from serious conversations with her due to fear of being judged, being uncomfortable.  During this entire time, I lived with my long time male best friend.  I was closer to him than my own brothers.  We were two bachelors in our mid 40s by the time 2016 rolled by.  Also in 2016, my best friend met a woman and after 3 months, married her during a trip to Vegas.  I was shocked and was concerned about how our living situation would change.  My best friend and I had a disagreement related to his quick engagement and I ended up abruptly moving out; our friendship ended.  He was afraid of growing old alone, which partially prompted the quick decision to marry.  I began to live in a new apartment by myself.   In 2017, I met a divorced woman, Rosa,  with two teen girls.  At this point, I was age 44, did not have children, not particularly interested in becoming a step father, but I continued to date their mother who I liked and was attracted to. I saw her every other weekend when she was children-free.  She was sweet and kind, and was interested in a long term relationship.  Rosa had a little bit of baggage: two time divorcee, and her last ex husband was an alcoholic who didn't always visit the children and she had to sue him for child support.  Rosa makes a decent earning and tried her hardest to be a good mother.  Rosa asked if I was seeing anyone else and I said no (I wasn't).  In early 2018, out of nowhere and after not having any contact since 2013, Summer, the woman I initially met and described above texted me a Happy Birthday message.  I was surprised and flattered to hear from her.  I told her I thought about her in the years we did not have contact.  Not knowing I was seeing Rosa, she asked to meet for coffee.  We met and caught up for 2 hours: there were lingering looks, flirting, and I told her she still looked good.   I went out to lunch with Summer and mentioned that I had been dating Rosa for a year and was only seeing her every other weekend.  Summer was disappointed.  Summer, like Rosa,  is kind and sweet.  I am sexually attracted to both. However, Summer is highly educated, travels the world, lives alone in a home she purchased,  has never had children (like me), and we have similar jobs though do not work together.  From 2018 to 2020, Summer and I kept in touch through random texts and I saw her a few more times.   One time I went over to fix something in her bathroom; I was nervous and attracted to her and after I was finished,  I immediately left to prevent anything from happening.   Another time she came to my home and we talked, exchanged lingering looks and flirted but I was able to control myself.  Another time I went over to her home again and we ended up in her bed and engaged in heavy foreplay.  I stopped it, feeling bad because I knew Rosa would be hurt. I  never told Rosa about Summer.  Another time, Summer and I flirted via text and she sent me erotic photos at my request.  I realized I was leading Summer on, so I ghosted Summer despite her many pleas to talk about it.  Meanwhile, Rosa sensed something was jeopardizing our relationship and put pressure on me to move in with her and her teen girls.  I had met the girls several times but did not have a strong relationship with them.  I ended up moving in with Rosa and her girls.  I thought that was the end until six months later, Summer, under a disguise, found Rosa and Rosa's children's social media pages and began to indicate that I had been cheating on Rosa, calling our phones from blocked numbers but not leaving messages, and letting Rosa know she had an intimate relationship with me.  At one point, Summer threatened to post texts/photos/screenshots to prove it, but has not.  Despite questioning me several times, Rosa has no idea who this is and I do not have the guts to tell her.  Some would feel Summer's reaction was warranted given out long history and  my subsequent ghosting.  I can tell Rosa has told her girls about this ""drama"" and her girls are looking at me differently. The oldest now lives with her grandparents in their hometown.  Rosa has begged me to tell her the truth but I say I do not know anything about it. I do not have the guts to contact Summer as I know I was wrong for how I treated her.  Summer did not let up and Rosa began to pressure marriage in 2022.  I agreed to it and we rushed to plan a wedding and married quickly in 2022.  I never contacted Summer after I ghosted her but she continues to find creative ways to let Rosa know she has intimate knowledge of me such as sending Rosa an old photo of me via Instagram.  Rosa feels what this woman is saying has some truth so she pressured me into purchasing a new home last year with her to further solidify, I feel, that I am ""hers.""  Rosa feels I know who is behind the harassing and cryptic messages and has recently threatened to hire a private investigator to reveal who this mystery woman.

1nd9og1,https://i.redd.it/7yi98vyb5bof1.png,Steam wand low/no pressure [Delonghi La Specialista Pregio],"Looking for a bit of advice on what could my issue here. I've tried a few things  but not having much luck.

So the symptoms are the steamer doesn't seem to get up to pressure, and only a very little splutter coming from the steam wand. Everything else seems fine. No problem making an espresso shot

Firstly I have run a descale cycle with descaler and then again with a vinegar water mix, with no improvement. 

So I have started looking into it deeper. One thing I did notice is when the steam wand was going, there was excess water going into the drip tray from the expansion chamber.. When I blocked the release pipe on the expansion chamber with my finger, pressure did actually build up in the steam wand, to the point it was almost working like normal. Until I release my finger that is. 

So that had me thinking it's at least not a blockage, because the steamer will work with pressure 

So tracing the steamer supply tube and drain tube, they meet at what I looks to be the steamer solenoid, ev2. I figured I'd replace that, and job done. Unfortunately made no difference. 

Now I'm reading up again and maybe it's the over pressure valve? I found this part number, 7313286129, but not 100% if it's the right one. And I can't see it in this schematic I have found.

Or maybe the water pump is working enough to make  a coffee shot but not the steam wand.


Anyway I'm at my wits end with this. It's for my mother. I used to be an appliance tech, but never with espresso machines. But in mums eyes I can fix anything.

I am very much sure that this app was probably made by a bunch of people who pretend to be educated about software development but actually have no idea how to build customer facing apps. The app is such a burning pile of shit that it's a miracle it even works.

The only time you can be satisfied with ordering delivery on the app is when you get a rider who goes above and beyond in customer service. 

The app itself 

1. Is extremely slow regardless of your internet connection

2. Is built to be anti-consumer since there is no way to get in touch with an actual customer service agent anywhere on the app. All you will get are bots who keep saying ""We tried doing X but it didn't happen"" over and over until you give up and accept that your money is gone.

3. Has the MOST terrible UX out of any platform I have seen. Even IRCTC probably has better developers. There is no way to access anything on the web except ""#CommunityPosts"". You cannot even change your address on the home screen ffs. It just feels like a giant hoarding has been placed on the app. 

4. Send you at least 10 notifications per day about the most stupid stuff while not actually having the deals to back it up 

5. Talks about deals at INR 9 and such but rarely has anything at a decent price. You almost always end up paying way over the sticker price. 

6. Has by far the worst rider management system, I get assigned riders who have 4 more deliveries for time critical items like cold coffees. The restaurant has the order ready for ages but because of the bad prioritization, I end up with a hot coffee instead.

Hi everyone! 👋

I’m starting a **hobby game project** inspired by *Coffee Talk*, but with a unique twist:

☕ **Game Concept**

* Main character: a **barista who volunteers for a deep sleep experiment**.
* After waking up years later, the world has turned into a **post-apocalyptic setting full of mutated, zombie-like humans**.
* Despite the chaos, a small café still stands. Survivors come in, share their stories, and you serve them drinks that influence the conversations and outcomes.
* **Atmosphere:** a mix of eerie, dark, and unsettling vibes combined with cozy, relaxing moments.
* **Gameplay:**
   * Dialogue choices that affect characters and story paths
   * Drink-making system (coffee, tea, special recipes)
   * Multiple storylines and endings

👥 **Looking for Teammates:**

* **Programmers** (JavaScript / React, or engines like Unity/Godot/Phaser)
* **2D/Pixel Artists** (character portraits, post-apocalyptic café setting, UI elements)
* **Writers / Narrative Designers** (character backstories, dialogues, branching choices)
* **Sound Designers / Composers** (lo-fi, ambient, dark atmospheric tracks)

ℹ️ **About Me**

* I’m a **game designer** who also has some experience in **JavaScript & basic game development**.
* I’m working on this project for fun and learning, and I’d love to build something cool together.
* If you want to gain experience and have fun building a unique game with me, feel free to DM! 🚀

📬 **Contact**

* You can DM me here on Reddit
* Or reach me on Discord: kapqae

 I worked with zGenMedia and came up with this. This isn’t [SD](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1lpe7r1/workflow_share_fluxkontext_portrait_grid/) or platform specific, but it came out of my earlier [workflow](https://pastebin.com/v8aN8MJd) experiments you CAN make this an app on your own device as well. But — now it evolved into a [standalone app](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1U9xDutUGtL6m2z45iI0YWUnnR5l2pTXh) that anyone can use.

If you’re building or training **LoRAs**, you know how time-consuming it can be to get data with enough variation. That’s what this tool is for.

🛠 **What It Does:**

* Spits out a grid of the clothing in one shot. 

⚠️ **Notes:**  
I do not have any restrictions on this. If you find a restriction it is due to the site itself. If you need help with API made a post for that.

This isn’t a final polished release — prompt tuning and pose variety can still be improved. But it’s **ready to use out of the box**, and more importantly, it gives you **consistent training material fast**.

📁 **Download & Previews:**  
👉 \[[App Link](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1U9xDutUGtL6m2z45iI0YWUnnR5l2pTXh)\]

None of this could have been done if I did not meet [zGenMedia](https://ko-fi.com/zgenmedia) and have them help me get this idea made. Thanks to Nano Banana this can be done for anyone.

I’ll post updates here if more features get added. Preview grids are attached below so you can see what the output looks like.

I also added a donation link — no paywall, Not a paid tool or service... the app is open and free to use or modify. If it helps save you time setting up your LoRA datasets, consider buying me a coffee.",4,1757496776.0,StableDiffusion,1,0.84,False

Guanilo: ""Yep, boss, this is a wonderful thing you've drawn.  Such a grand tower.  Beautiful structure, very imposing.  This thing is the crowning jewel that truly Perfects the cityscape.  But, lo and behold, look at the lot.  It's still empty!""

1nd9iw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/brimagine/comments/1nd9iw5/how_to_play/,How To Play,"**Getting Started** Brimagine is played in two teams. Teams can be made of one or two players. Fewer teams means quicker matches, so if there are more than two of you, team up! Teams can have different numbers, i.e., a team of one player can play against a team of two players. Each team chooses one of the starter decks

At the top of your decks are titles, ""Weaver"" and ""Sculpted"". These sections tell you about your Heroes! the main characters of the game. The people whose story you will be telling. Teams of two pick either the Weaver or Sculpted and single player teams get to play as all characters in their deck.

Now that you have met your heroes, let’s place them on the map. Above the Weaver and Sculpted boxes you will find some images of a maps. You only use one team's map per match so choose which team's map you want to use for this match. Once you have chosen a map, the other team gets to place their mini-map anywhere on the map.

In the future I may have maps to download, but for now you must draw your own map from your deck's map description. Once you have your map, you will need to find some game pieces. These can be bits from board games, toys, coins, any tiny object will do. Both teams place their Weaver and Sculpted anywhere you feel like starting. 

**How Do Turns Work?** Each turn, you have two resources called “Action” and “Movement”, or “Act” and “Move” for short.  
Character Movement means to go somewhere, by moving a character’s piece. Going from point A to point B.  
Character Action means to do something, which usually takes place in the players’ collective imaginations. Something that can be done while a character remains in place.  
Each turn, your player character gets only one Action and only one Movement. You can use these in either order. You do not have to use both but you must do something on your turn.  
E.g., You can “Act then Move” or “Move then Act” or “Just Move” or “Just Act”.  
Having a character ""actively wait/do nothing"" does not count as an action.

A turn might look like, “The Alien walks to the cupboard, then eats the giant cookie.”  
You cannot perform your Action while Moving, E.g., “The office worker kicks the coffee machine on the way to his desk,” This is not allowed!

Team members always play their turns one after the other, but they can switch their order.  
E.g., Round 1: Team 1: Sculpted, Weaver. Team 2: Weaver, Sculpted.  
Round 2: Team 1: Weaver, Sculpted. Team 2: Weaver Sculpted. 

**Action Abilities** Action Assets are your character’s special moves! Only their character can use them. They come with all sorts of interesting effects. They are beneath the Weaver and sculpted boxes in your deck. Abilities can get a bit complicated so make sure to read them carefully. You are allowed to read anything from of your opponent’s deck before or during a match. You play Action Assets on your turn by spending your character’s Action. So if you play your action asset, you cannot also do something else. But you can still use your movement. You can only play each Action Asset once per match. 

**Passive Abilities** On your Character’s bio your will find their “Passive Ability”. There are different types of Passive Abilities:   
Type A – Actionless: your character can do this thing on their turn without using an action. But only once per turn.  
Type R – Required: you can this ability can activate on any turn if its two requirements are met.  
Type O – Obligated: This ability is like a Required ability, except if its requirement/s are met on any turn, then you must follow its instructions (even if you do not want to).  
Type P – Permanent: this ability is always active from the beginning till the end of the match.

**Guiding Principles** You will find your character’s Guiding Principles beneath their Passive Abilities. They create a general boundary for what that character will and will not do. E.g. if a character’s Guiding principle is, “Afraid of swimming and obsessed with ice-cream,” then you cannot make that character swim, and if they see ice-cream you should get them the ice-cream. 

**Staples** Staples are a character shared between teammates. You will find them beneath your goals in your deck. They can be played once per round on either the Weaver’s or Sculpted’s turn, but not both. You can choose which character's turn to play them on each round. Staples get their own Action and Movement during the turns they are being used. Staples do not start the match on the map. You must spend an action to put them into play; either the Staples own action, or the action of the character whose turn it is. They can be placed anywhere on the map. Staples do not have Action Abilities but they do have Passive Abilities and Guiding Principles.

**Items** Each team has three items, found at them bottom of your deck. Some items have abilities and others are just simple objects. Items do not need an action to be put into play and they can be placed anywhere on the map. But you can only put your team’s items into play and only on your turns.

Picking up/letting go of items does not use an action. If another character is holding an item (kept anywhere on their person), it cannot be stolen with a normal action. But items can be stolen with abilities, like, ""Steal an item from another character."" Character can also only carry another character with an ability.

Collected Items are items that you can find on the map, such as if you break something or pick something up that is drawn on the map but its not in your deck. Collected Items do not have abilities.  
  
The rule of DOORS: Doors do not require an action to open while walking. Unless, it is stated or shown somewhere that a door is locked or barricaded in some way, in which case you will have to use an action to open the door. 

**Death and Taxes** If a character should die, they will magically respawn at the beginning of their next turn. When they respawn characters do not regain any Action Abilities that have already been played. If it is a Weaver that dies, they do not lose any of the progress they have made towards their goal. If the most compelling version of the story does not include a magical respawn, your character may be replaced by an identical twin, or the long-lost child, who now seeks to avenge their fallen parent or whoever else you can think of. In this case the new character will inherit whatever Action Abilities are left behind, as well as the progress made towards your team's goal.

Items that are destroyed can be put back into play as good as new at any time, unless the item description states otherwise.

Knock out: if a character becomes unconscious, they can be awakened by a tap from a teamed character, with no action cost. If you find yourself paying taxes in my game then you are definitely doing something wrong. 

**Background Characters** It is recommended that you only play with the characters in your decks. But if you really want to, you can add Background characters. They can move and have dialogue but they have no actions! You cannot use them to prop open doors and you cannot build ladders out of them but most importantly, they cannot complete goals! Even if your goal is for someone to fall into your trap, if a background character falls into your trap, the goal does not count. 

**The “No Going Back” Rule** If someone does something that breaks the rules, and no one calls them out for it, once the next player finishes their turn, it does not matter that the rule was broken. However, once a player has realised a rule has been broken, it should be correct for all current and future turns. 

**Side Quests** Recommended to be used by advanced players only: Each individual player (even those on the same team) has the option to create a Side Quest before a match begins. A Side Quest is a goal that is unique to an individual match, something you make up on the spot. Completing a side quest is worth half a goal. So here is what that looks like:  
Team 1, Goal Complete, 1 Side Quest Complete - Team 2, Goal Complete, No Side Quest = Team 1 Wins Team 1, Goal Incomplete, 1 Side Quest Complete - Team 2, Goal Complete, No Side Quest = Team 2 Wins But, if you do not complete your side quest, it takes away half a Goal Point:  
Team 1, Goal Complete, 1 Side Quest Incomplete - Team 2, Goal Complete, No Side Quest = Team 2 Wins Team 1, Goal Complete, 1 Side Quest Incomplete - Team 2, Goal Complete, 2 Side Quests Incomplete = Team 1 Wins 

And that’s it! Everything you need to know about Brimagine. Now go make some teams, plays some actions, activate some abilities and complete some goals! But most importantly… no rolling dice! I HATE DICE! All strategy, no chance.  
If you wanna see what a match looks like, then go watch a YouTube video on the Authilbrim YT channel I’ll posting at in the future. Ok byeeeee… I sure hope no one has the audacity to design their own Brimagine decks.

We only dated a few months, but he was so avoidant in the time when we were seeing each other I was stressed out so badly.  I promised myself I would never put up with another avoidance behavior. So I bit the bullet and I ended it myself. 

I’m proud of myself for ending it, but I never stop thinking about  them. I reached out one time in the winter and they responded politely, but it never went anywhere. Then just recently this person reached out to me just to “catch up”. I suggested we get together for coffee., they agreed, said they would reach out in a couple of weeks, a couple of weeks has come and gone - no follow up from them. 

This is the worst. 

I’m trying to act like a securely attached person so that I will feel like a securely attached person . I guess a securely attached person would  let it go. Right? I certainly don’t feel like letting it go. I am totally preoccupied with it and I wish they would reach out to me so I can ignore them as if that will end the pain so I can get them back in someway. 

For any of those securely attached or just more securely attached than I am …. What do I do? How do I get over this?

Tried different proportions for second one. 10g with 100ml water came out fruity. For phin filter aeropress grind would work nicely for optimum extraction (~5 min) if 10g not enough for someone.

A total waste, and I'm not doing it again. I'm 44 and have been drinking coffee since 15 or so. Last year it's been only tea, but I started drinking more and more, then moved on to energydrinks. Sometimes I stopped for a day because my body needed a break from the knot in my chest, but that's pretty much it.

I tried this once years ago and only lasted a week. I can't even remember why I slipped but I wouldn't be surprised if I just started to feel good and ""forgot"" the reason I quit and had some caffeine again.

I'm an artist and a writer that doesn't paint or write anymore because all I have is that one hour after the first caffeinated drink, and I often just end up procrastinating or gaming during that window. Sometimes I stayed up late to finish projects because I felt more motivated at that time - which is when the effect have LEFT the body... That got me thinking about mood as well. I actually feel ok in the morning before caffeine, and I usually feel pretty good (not productive though) after the afternoon crash. Rest of the time it's just jitters, restlessness, feeling uncomfortable and OCD like behaviour and thoughts.

This puzzle is easy to solve. I know I'm sensitive to caffeine, but just how much will be interesting to find out the coming weeks.

I have a puppy at 6 months here, and I have chores to do, work and driving. It might be a bad time to quit cold turkey (I won't taper), but it's always a bad time! I want to have normal, steady energy. I don't wan't to have to plan my next cup of bug-poison every single day. I know what's wrong and I'm gonna fix it, for once.

Yes, everything is built for people being in constant panic-mode. But I never cared for society anyway. xD

Rent, utilities, internet, random Target and Walmart runs, even just setting up a basic room,it feels like a whole second course on top of my actual courses.

Back home, I watched family get buried in credit card debt, so I’ve always been cautious. Now I’m here trying to keep track of coffees, snacks between lectures, textbooks that cost way more than I thought, groceries, and a new Eversource bill I didn’t even plan for. Living on my own adds up quick, but I wanted the independence.

I’m trying to stay on top of a budget and I know building credit matters, but I don’t want to dig a hole before my first year’s even over. A couple of people mentioned debit cards that build credit, where you’re only spending what you actually have but it still reports to the bureaus. That honestly seems more my speed while I’m figuring things out. Anyone here ever used one, and did it actually help your score? Any fees or downsides I should know?

I’d also love local tips. What’s the best way to keep utilities down once winter hits, because heat bills already scare me? Is there a decent internet option around Amherst that doesn’t suck but isn’t overpriced? For groceries, do most students lean more toward Aldi, Trader Joe’s, or Big Y? And are there any good textbook hacks outside of Amazon and the UMass library reserves?

Right now I’m walking or riding PVTA with my UCard to avoid Uber costs, cooking more instead of hitting up downtown Amherst food spots, and trying to set a weekly cap for “fun” money so I don’t burn through cash by week two. Would love to hear what worked for you guys here at UMass.

First things first. I feel a bit let down. By the phrasing that caramelly has on their website.

I had wishlisted the Outin nano from [caramelly.in](http://caramelly.in) a few months ago. Since my travels has become a bit more frequent, I decided to place an order. Visited [caramelly.in](http://caramelly.in) searched for outin and placed an order for the gift set with the outin bag.

It's primarily my mistake. I should have noticed it better. But this is how it shows up when you search for outin on their website. And the case is OutIn. Didn't think twice and placed an order.

[Water heating.](https://reddit.com/link/1nd9fl1/video/itgojt0h0bof1/player)

Took about 2.5 mins (maid's phone call in the background :')). Manual claims 3-4mins. Like the Outin Nano, the light grows as the heating process progresses.

[Extraction Process](https://reddit.com/link/1nd9fl1/video/ilz1ko1x0bof1/player)

Extraction process is around a min I guess.

**The coffee:**

Okayish crema. The coffee tasked a bit acidic than my Breville. Definitely very drinkable. Decently hot(forgot to measure the temparature).

Overall, The machine seems decent. Definitely good for travelling purpose.

Still a bit disappointed that this isn't the outin nano.

The somatic correlates of the undulating sensation follow thusly: Commencing from the pedal extremtiies ascending to my cranial apex, I assessed a fluctuating intensity, peaking at 7.3 on a subjective scale—where 1 represents baseline inrtness and 10 an unbearable onus—manifeesting in shuddring muscle fibers apparently synchronizing to a pseudo-rhythmic cadence.

The most pronounced somatic signal was localized in my quadriceps and deltoids, presenting with a notable sensation akin to ungoverned vibration, accompanied by a mild lactic acid accumulation distinctively perceptible post-exertion. Temporal duration of this 'vibration' lasted approximately seven minutes. Concurrently, a pervasive, albeit pleasant warmth emerged as a byproduct of metabolic acttivity, chiefly around the thoracic region. My cardiovascular rhythm accelerated to a range of 120 beats per mknute, sustaining for five intervals of sixty seconds each before returning to average baseline leveels.

Seemingly paradoxical yet unexplainably fulfilliing, an ensuing state of menatl satisfaction juxtaposed the trnsient physical fatigue. Perhaps it's the dopamine surge following successful task completion or simply a placebo-like mental approval of self-behavioral compliance, on account of the task’s realization. Either way, it's an intriguing blend of exhaustion scored at 6.5 and a subjective 8.8 of contentment. I guess it's the subtle joys of being a non-athlete engaging in sporadic physical maneuvers...

Into the kitchen to make dunner I stayed in the bedroom for a few minutes and (I'm not proud of this) noticed her journal was under her pillow, I took it to the bathroom and closed the door, I flipped to the end and noticed she's been writing in it today, so I read it and honestly it made me so angry that I felt as though someone had boiled my blood into copper and. Poured it back into my body, the book explicitly detailed her waking up at 7 am (normally she wakes up around 11 am due to the baby) and finding someone in her bed, she thought it was me because we live very far from any family, so she rolled over and it was her uncle and he wasn't wearing anything, she started to scream and he got on top of her and tried to open her legs, she wrote that her abdomen started burning so she stopped struggling for fear of something happening to the baby,and resorted to kicking him instead he finally got off of her and she yelled at him to get out, well, long story short he grabbed her breasts which are now leaking a little bit of blood, and began jerking them around, she jumped up and made her way to the kitchen to try and turn the events into something more civil and her Dad called her, God knows why he called, normally he calls around 11 when she wakes up, but I'm so thankful he did, she stayed on the phone with him for about an hour although she didn't tell him what was happening, I guess him just being on the phone weirded her uncle out and about an hour after her been on the phone he decided to leave but he told her that he got up at 4:00 that morning just so that he could get up here while she was still sleeping and hopefully make her think that it was me crawling into bed with her because it's still dark where we live at 7:00 he said he would have graped her had thing's gone his way, anyway, by the time I was done reading I was shaking really hard, I mean this is my wife. I don't know how he got in the house, I told her that I read her journal and she broke down and started sobbing some with what she feels that was her fault, I told her to stop thinking like that.

To be as unbiased as possible in your evaluation, I leave my dating history, this current situation, and my immediate response/question below. 



Background: I (F,29) have had 3 serious relationships before. I was once engaged to someone for almost 4 years between 20 and 24 years. In this relationship, my ex was consistently messaging me, but it would also quickly turn into harassment messages if we were having arguments/fights. I felt smothered and without any sense of control in my life. In my next relationship of 3 years, I was the person being told that to message once or twice a day was too much so I became aware of people who preferred to message way less. Finally my last relationship was one of unrequited love (him not being interested in me), and we decided to remain friends who message once in a while to catch up. Since getting over this heartbreak, I have met one guy for a casual hookup and we still message occassionally where he mentions he would want to hookup again.

  
Current situation: Met this guy on Tindr, on the Long-Term Relationship side of the app (as I felt ready to move away from the idea of random hookups). We started chatting and at first, it was very rapid back and forth which I felt was normal considering you are trying to quickly get to know someone before then you say ""let's go on a date"" and then you will know more. Within two days of speaking, he said why don't we go for a coffee (I liked the forwardness, not beating around the bush) so I agreed. We ended up having dinner and conversation went on for hours (I also take 2 hours to eat a meal, no joke). He is a very respectful person, showed interest, is a massive Star Wars fan (I am not familiar but happy to learn). 

  
Question: Where my issue lies in that this guys messages me so many times throughtout the day. Even when i haven't responded back for 2 hours, he sometimes send me another one asking how everything is going. But when I do respond, he will message within 20 minutes guarantee. And I feel suffocated. I am someone who is super independent in my day-to-day activities, and have many friends/family that i will catch up with each day. So if I am not going to a specific gym class, I am at an art course, or meeting a friend etc. I have learned how to be more protective over my time because I do feel it is our most valuable resource. I am not someone to message back straight away until I feel I can enjoy messaging someone, and I also tend to expect that from the person I am seeing. I LIKE to see someone being busy doing their own thing, and then to catch up in the evening over a quick audio or slightly longer message instead. It makes me feel they are prioritising their own activities still, and not dropping everything for me. Also feels like I am not under threat by being controlled by a person who has nothing else to do with their time (my first ex). My question is is it unfair for me to be judging someone for messaging so quickly, or have i unintentionally become an avoidant who flinches at the first sign of another person's interest?",1,1757494983.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

1nd93qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1nd93qe/what_would_be_a_good_jobcareer_path_for/,What would be a good job/career path for chronically unlucky people?,"So this might sound a little odd and the last time I (24M) posted this online, all I got was people accusing me of rage bait, which I promise you this is not. I also promise that this is in its entirety real, even though a lot of people insist that I made all of this up:

I'm incredibly unlucky. A few years ago inconvenient and bad things just started happening to me and around me, and it's made it pretty much impossible for me to hold down or usually even get a job in the first place. I've been out of a job for 22 of the last 24 months.

I currently live with my mother and my stepdad, the latter of whom is extremely pissed about my still being there. I thought I'd be able to move out again after a few months but now it's been almost three years and I still haven't been able to keep a job long enough to save up money to move out. About 2 out of every 3 days, either one big thing or multiple smaller things will happen that will basically just make me unable to do any of the things I need to do. I'll give you some examples, and I recognize that these sound outlandish, but it's just the way my cookie crumbles.

I was able to get a job as a remote salesperson. The job had a base pay of minimum wage, plus commission. I've always been pretty subpar at talking to people but also not the very worst I've ever seen, but after about nearly ten weeks of working there, I barely managed to land any sales, and then I got on a zoom call with a client. She was a woman who looked late 30s-early 40s. As soon as she saw my face she confused me for someone that she believed had stalked her in the past, and she didn't believe me when I tried to set the record straight. She called the cops and reported me for stalking her. The police showed up to my house and nearly arrested me before I cleared everything up. However, during that time the woman also reported me to my boss and the boss claimed he believed me but he fired me anyway to ""avoid the drama of it all.""

Another example: two days ago I was going to a job interview. I was instructed to bring a paper copy of my resume, so I printed one out. I took a bus to the place where I was interviewing and as I was approaching the building, a bird swooped down, tore up my resume, pooped right on my head and flew away. I didn't have time to go wash my hair or print a new resume, as the bus had already been late and I was supposed to be there two minutes earlier and my phone had died at 79% battery so I wasn't able to call the manager to ask to reschedule. I went in and they turned me down, probably for having bird shit in my hair and no paper resume.

A third example: On my way home from a different job interview last month I accidentally stepped in a big wad of gum on the sidewalk and it got stuck to my shoe and made walking very uncomfortable so I attempted to wipe it off on a sewer grate, but this caused my shoe to just tumble right off my feet even though it was tied properly and tightly enough and it went into the sewer where I obviously couldn't just go get it. Because I only had one shoe the bus drivers wouldn't let me on (no shoes no shirt no service) and I had to walk home, which was nearly eight miles. On my way home, a passing man tripped and spilled an entire cup of incredibly hot coffee directly on my face. About a quarter mile before I got home, my glasses fell off my face as I was walking right as someone on a bike passed me and ran over my glasses, completely breaking them. The lock on the front door to my house coincidentally stopped working and I couldn't unlock it so I had to wait another four hours for my parents to wake up so they could let me in since they were asleep and couldn't hear their phone ringing and they couldn't hear the doorbell even though it's usually loud as hell.

I could go on and on and on about how stuff like that is constantly happening to me. On average I would say it happens probably about 4-5 times a week. Even just ten minutes ago my power went out right as I was writing this reddit post and I had to start the whole thing over on my phone. It's become basically impossible to find and keep a job and my parents are completely unsympathetic to the situation, and they said if I don't get a steady job with steady payment in the next few months they're going to kick me out and I'll be homeless if that happens. Clearly I can't get a normal job like this, and I can't find any logical way to reduce the amount of coincidental bad things that happen, so my only real option is to find a way to work around it. What would be a steadily paying job where an extremely unlucky person like me could excel in and not lose my job due to bad luck?",2,1757494887.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

Elias’ fingers rattled across his keyboard like a man possessed. Forums, threads, comment chains — he devoured them all, chasing down stories of a desert toll booth that could send people away. At first he laughed it off as another internet myth, the sort of creepypasta born in shadowy corners of Reddit and 4chan. But then the patterns started to emerge.

The missing people weren’t anonymous. You could find their names in old newspapers, trace their photos back to real families. And always, always, there was mention of a man. A tall figure with eyes like faded glass — not grey, not milky, but drained of color, as though the world had run out of paint.

Elias leaned back, the glow of Reddit reflected in his spectacles. He wasn’t anyone remarkable. An accountant by trade, a loner by consequence. His life had been beige — steady, dull, almost invisible. Yet inside, something restless twisted. He yearned for the open seas, the wild road, the adrenaline of chance and danger. His only adventures were pinned to his Pinterest board, embarrassingly titled *Adventures I’ll Have Someday.* 

He clicked over to his Pinterest board.

A pirate ship crested a storm wave, sails straining against the wind. Another image showed a booth half-buried in desert sands, glowing faintly under a red horizon. A misty forest clearing held one more, its wooden frame weathered and leaning beneath skeletal trees. Then a sketch of a crossroads appeared, a lone booth silhouetted against a sky bleeding with sunset, its arm raised like it was waiting. And pinned between them all was a photograph of endless ice: a booth standing solitary on a frozen plain, northern lights bending across the sky above it.

To anyone else, it was just pulp adventure kitsch, a collage of daydreams and half-remembered myths. But to Elias, it was possibility.

Tonight, though, the clippings and threads all converged into one undeniable truth: the Toll Booth was real.

And for the first time in his life, Elias thought: *Why not me?*

The question jolted him. He tore through a drawer until he found an old road atlas, circling the desert highways in red ink. Somewhere out there was the Booth. Somewhere out there was the Man.

Tomorrow, he’d go looking.

Morning broke and Elias woke with a charge he hadn’t felt in years. He filled a thermos with coffee, tossed granola bars into the passenger seat, and slid an old mixtape into the stereo. The case, scrawled in red Sharpie, read *ADVENTURE!* — a college relic from when adventure meant nothing riskier than speeding with the windows down.

The desert unfolded like a painting scorched by the sun. Mile after mile of emptiness shimmered before him, daring him to keep going. Elias gripped the wheel as though the road itself might vanish.

Hours passed. The granola bars were gone, the coffee drained. His enthusiasm began to sag until he spotted a lonely diner on the horizon. He pulled off, hungry and half-ready to abandon the whole thing.

Inside, the air smelled of frying oil and burnt coffee. And there, in the last booth, sat the Man.

At first glance, nothing special: tall, weathered coat, skin etched by sun. But the eyes gave him away — that washed-out not-grey, not-white, that gaze that seemed to peel the world back.

Elias’ breath caught. He blurted, far too loudly, “Do you know where the Toll Booth is?”

The Man studied him with a silence so deep it pressed on Elias’ chest. Finally, in a voice like gravel:

“The desert takes what it pleases.”

Elias opened his mouth, shut it, then forced out, “So…is that a yes?”

The Man slid a small card across the table. Neat handwriting. Directions. Then he turned back to his plate of pancakes, as if Elias no longer existed.

Elias clutched the card like treasure. He had the map. He had his proof. The Toll Booth was real.

The road stretched endlessly, heat rising in shimmering curtains. The stereo blared “I Am the Highway,” the guitar swelling as wide as the horizon. Elias rolled down the windows and screamed the chorus until his throat burned. For a moment, he believed it: this was the start of his story.

Then came the music. Not from the stereo, but drifting across the desert wind. Brass and drums, faint but steady.

As he crested a rise, Elias saw them: a funeral procession, New Orleans–style. Men in black suits and straw hats, women in veils, children with parasols. A brass band led them, playing something mournful yet weirdly jubilant.

Elias slowed to a crawl. His windows rattled with each blast of the trombone. None of the mourners looked at him. They stepped, swayed, danced across the asphalt as though they’d been marching for centuries.  A strange yearning crept upon Elias.  He suddenly felt as though he himself must join the odd funeral procession.  His fingers were on the door latch and he was about to get out when he abruptly came to his senses.  Shaking his head like he was trying to free himself of that odd pull, he instead locked the car doors.

At the end, a boy with a snare drum turned his head. His eyes locked on Elias — not just at him, but *through* him. Straight through bone and marrow. Then the boy snapped back into step, and the whole procession turned onto a side road that wasn’t there.

The desert was empty again. No band. No mourners. Just the hum of his engine.

Elias let out a shaky laugh. “Yeah. Totally normal. Reddit definitely left that part out.”

I own a Bezzera Magica since 8 years. Since the coffee tastes pretty bitter as of late, o decided to open the machine and adjust the pressure (9 bar instead of 12 for extraction and lower the other pressure from 1,5 bar to 1).

While this did help somewhat to reduce the bitterness, I’m still not fully happy. Now I found something inside the machine that worries me a little bit and might have something to do with the bitterness. Pictures are included!

Something seems to be broken at the boiler or whatever the big thing is - sorry lol! You can even see something that Looks Like saw dust inside the machine. And the Origin seems to be one of the screws on the “boiler”!

I get up slowly, as if the weight of my morning rituals might somehow delay the inevitable. My head sinks into my palms, elbows balanced on rickety knees. I sit there for a while, not thinking, not feeling—just stalled.

Finally, I let out a long, slow breath and begin another day. They’re all the same.

Wake up. Hate being awake. Stretch. Empty bowels. Dress. Eat. Get to work.



The drive out is long and hot, even before the sun’s up. No traffic, of course—just empty desert roads lined with dust, ghost signs, and the occasional stubborn cactus trying to look like it still believes in rain.



I pass the diner that never opens, the gas station that’s been boarded since Clinton, and the crooked sign that says “WEL OME” in a way that feels personal.



The booth shows up like a bad memory—squatting alone at the edge of everything. Concrete walls, metal roof, one cracked window. A monument to pointlessness.



I park in the shade it barely casts, unlock the door, and step inside. The air smells like warm vinyl and stale tobacco. Everything’s just as I left it: the stool with the wobble, the DNA Diviner with its soft red light and faded decals, the ledger with no end or beginning.



I sit. The chair creaks like it’s tired too. I clock in.

Like a mirage an old Pontiac slowly lurches forward, unsure if I too am a mirage in this booth.  The Pontiac comes to a halt.  The driver’s a woman, late thirties maybe. Sunglasses, lipstick, funeral-black dress. She rolls down the window and stares straight ahead. She doesn't speak.



I slide open the panel.

“Arm.”



She doesn’t argue. Just shifts in her seat as if rethinking every decision that led her here and slowly stretches out her arm through the window like it’s a toll ticket.



The Diviner hums. One drop of blood, and it begins.



The first screen lights up:

“Venice. March 13th, 2046. Midnight. Balcony.”



The second follows:

“Payment Due: Final memory of her face.”

She doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t even blink. Just nods once, slow and final.

I press the button. A rusty mechanical arm lifts from the ground beside the booth—like an old-fashioned toll gate. No lights. No fireworks. No celestial choir. Just that creaking steel arm rising in the dry wind.

She drives forward without hurry. Her car rolls past the booth and keeps going, engine purring softly. Then, as the road stretches ahead, the heat begins to shimmer. Her silhouette blurs, bends, softens like a mirage.

And just like that—she’s gone.

No tire marks. No sign. Just sunlight on asphalt, and the taste of dust in the air.

I lower the arm, log the toll, and take a drink of coffee that’s already gone cold.  I make a face.  I hate cold coffee.  

The hours between cars stretch like dried sinew—taut, cracking, empty.

Sometimes it’s three hours. Sometimes ten. I’ve gone whole days without seeing a single soul. Just the sound of the wind scraping sand across the asphalt. Just the booth. Just me.

There’s no radio. No internet. Management said signals interfere with the Diviner. I don’t know if that’s true, but I never tested it. I’ve stopped testing things. It’s easier to just sit and rot.

I read the same paperback mystery once a week. It’s missing the last five pages. I like that. I like not knowing how something ends.

I used to count the tumbleweeds. I’d name them, even. Then one day I realized I was doing it unironically, and I stopped. Felt too close to losing the thread.

Sometimes, I wonder if they space the arrivals out on purpose—like it’s part of the price. Not theirs. *Mine.*  I can’t even remember how I got here anymore.

Because in the end, it’s just waiting. For them to show up. For them to leave. For the dust to settle.

Some days I wonder if I’m still alive.  
 Other days, I know I am.  
 That’s worse.

I’ve been tempted over the…years? Months? There are no seasons here to tell…but over the length of time I have thought of escaping this purgatory and going…on.  Somewhere.  Anywhere.  Ideally where the coffee is hot.

Car.  Wait.  Car.  Wait.  New Amsterdam February 29 2188.  First memory  of snow.  Rome March 15, 44 BC.  37 drachmas.  Munich November 8, 1923.  All feelings of hate.  All dates people longed to be at and as they crossed the threshold their future, the past, lay before them.  I wonder if they ever returned.

The desert was unbearably hot.  Oppressive.  It’s late afternoon when the next car arrives. A pickup—sun-bleached, dented, the kind that rattles louder than it drives. The kind I used to drive.

I look up from my half-solved crossword as it rolls to a stop. Nothing about it stands out—until I see the driver’s face.

I freeze.

It's Mason.  
 Goddamn Mason.

1nd90rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nd90rt/aitah_for_trying_to_establish_boundaries_whilst/,AITAH for trying to establish boundaries whilst wanting forever sleep?,"I (29m) have been progressively getting more and more depressed over the last 3 years due to a multitude of factors including: chronic bowel issues (undiagnosed after 3 years) resulting in social isolation, toxic codependency on my cohabitating gf (30f), a late diagnosis of inattentive adhd, sudden onsets of personality changes eg short term gambling addiction (in the clear now after losing my life personal life savings) new found feelings of anger (adhd medication uncovered suppressed anger) and general shifts from toxic tolerance to resistance. 

Relationships been in the brink of collapse for nearly a year.

In July I tried to forever sleep, and ever since every conflict jumps the spiral and goes straight to wanting and even planning the forever sleep. I have at least 10 different plans of how I will do it now. 

I have even in therapy for 2 years and am actively seeking voluntary admission but the NHS are resistant, just waiting to hear back from my works private healthcare. 

 
I am fighting for my life daily, I am trying to build tiny flames, establish independence so I can break this toxic codependency I have on her (she’s happy I’m happy, she’s sad I’m sad energy). 

On Sunday, for the first time in 3 years I met somebody socially for a coffee/catchup and joined a drama company to meet new people. When I returned from my coffee we had a simple “how was your day” type chat and all of a sudden it spiralled into chaos. Instantly felt all of the joy and hope I’ve worked so hard to build vaporise. I jumped straight to wanting forever sleep and cancelled on meeting the drama company (Monday night). Completely extinguished my embers. 

I know the issue here is my codependency, I know the issue is my mental health. But I cannot break this when my trigger is now 99% her? (Used to have multiple but now they’ve all gone) 

I do not feel like I have the capacity to offer her any emotional support whilst I am literally struggling to keep myself alive. I don’t feel like this is abusive short term, whilst I try and stabilise. But she disagrees, and so does her therapist.. she’s even started calling out my freeze responses to conflict/overwhelm  (life long and working on it in therapy which has definitely improved 400% in the two years) as playing games or manipulating? I never freeze up and shut down to hurt/punish/dismiss her. My freeze response is a complete shutdown and paralysis of my mind - my therapist says it’s a form of dissociation which is partially from my list of trauma and partially my inattentive adhd. 


I am seeking voluntary admission but if this doesn’t transpire I will be ending this relationship for both our sakes, so I don’t finally snap and sleep forever and so she doesn’t fall further down this pit with me. 

AITHA - for wanting to tell her that I cannot handle anything emotional from her right now but I can be there physically (hugs/cuddles/sat together)?

1nd8y8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZyptoApp/comments/1nd8y8u/the_complete_guide_to_crypto_cards_in_2025/,The Complete Guide to Crypto Cards in 2025,"Crypto cards aren’t the future, they’re already here. In 2025, millions of people are turning their coins into coffee, their tokens into taxis, and their stablecoins into Saturday nights out.

A [crypto card](https://zypto.com/personal/crypto-cards/) is the bridge between the on-chain world and the checkout counter, and it’s fast becoming the must-have tool for anyone serious about digital assets.

This guide breaks down what crypto cards are, how they work, the different types available, and which are the best crypto cards in 2025. Spoiler: Zypto cards define what the best looks like.

# What Is a Crypto Card?

At its core, a crypto card looks and feels like any other Visa or Mastercard in your wallet. The twist? Instead of being tied to a bank balance, it is fuelled by your crypto. Whether it is Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, or memecoins, a crypto card converts your digital stack into real-world spending power.

Unlike the clunky ‘spend crypto directly’ models of the past, today’s crypto cards handle conversion behind the scenes. Tap at a café, shop online, book flights, the merchant just sees a normal card transaction, while your assets quietly cover the bill.

# How Crypto Cards Work

Generally, crypto cards work like this.

1. Load your card – Transfer crypto from your wallet or app.
2. Conversion at checkout – When you pay, your crypto is automatically converted to local fiat.
3. Use anywhere – Accepted at millions of merchants worldwide, anywhere Visa or Mastercard are welcomed.

That is the category norm. But Zypto cards do things differently, and better. Instead of converting at the moment of payment and leaving you exposed to volatility, Zypto cards convert when you load.

That means you decide when to turn crypto into fiat, lock in profits during a pump, and protect yourself from sudden dips.

Once it is on the card, it is local currency ready to spend – predictable, stable, and under your control.

# Types of Crypto Cards

Not all cards are created equal. Think of them as different tools for different jobs.

* [**Prepaid Crypto Cards**](https://zypto.com/personal/crypto-cards/) Load them once and spend until they are empty. They are more private, often soft-KYC, and great for people who like clean budgeting.
* [**Reloadable Crypto Cards**](https://zypto.com/personal/crypto-cards/) Ongoing use, higher limits, premium features. Perfect for power users who want a crypto card they can actually live on.
* [**Physical Crypto Cards**](https://zypto.com/personal/crypto-cards/) Plastic or metal in your hand, tap or swipe in-store, withdraw at ATMs.
* [**Virtual Crypto Cards**](https://zypto.com/personal/crypto-cards/) Instant issue, app-based, perfect for online shopping and subscriptions. Even better, add them to Apple Pay or Google Pay and pay on the go wherever you are. No waiting for delivery, just spin one up in minutes and start spending.

Like choosing between sneakers, boots, and sandals – they will all get you walking, but the right fit depends on where you are headed.

# Benefits of Using a Crypto Card

Why bother with a crypto card instead of just cashing out? Here is why.

* Global acceptance
* High spending limits
* Low fees
* Instant off-ramps
* Everyday convenience

Crypto cards are not just ‘nice to have’. They are a lifestyle upgrade.

# What to Look for in the Best Crypto Cards

Not all crypto cards deserve space in your wallet. Here is what to look for.

* Fees and FX rates – Low or zero monthly fees are a must.
* Transaction limits – Do they cap you at a coffee, or can you book flights and hotel suites?
* Supported assets – Stablecoins, altcoins, and yes, even your favourite meme tokens.
* Mobile wallet integration – Apple Pay, Google Pay, and app support make daily use simple.
* Security features – 3DS, fraud protection, and flexible PIN options keep you safe.

If a provider cannot deliver on these, you are better off looking elsewhere.

# The Best Crypto Cards in 2025

This is the section everyone jumps to, and fair enough. Here is the roundup.

* [**Zypto Reloadable Physical Card**](https://zypto.com/personal/crypto-cards/) High limits, premium feel, no monthly fees. Designed for serious users who want a real replacement for their traditional card.
* [**Zypto Virtual Card**](https://zypto.com/personal/crypto-cards/) Instant issue, accepted anywhere online, and ready for mobile wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay so you can tap in-store too. Together with the physical, it is the fastest off-ramp around.
* [**Zypto Prepaid Options**](https://zypto.com/personal/crypto-cards/) For lighter, more private spending. Perfect for single-load use, gifts, or budgeting.

And remember, Zypto’s conversion model means you do not get stung by last-minute volatility. You load on your terms, lock in gains when the market is up, and spend with confidence.

Other players exist in the market, but most come with higher fees, lower limits, or restrictive terms. Zypto cards are built for power users, frequent travellers, and anyone who wants their crypto to actually work in the real world.

https://preview.redd.it/j0a1895qwaof1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa2f490bf12a777e595fcc905046d25453832244

# Crypto Cards vs Traditional Cards

Why switch at all? Three words: control, limits, freedom.

* Traditional cards: low limits, fees on fees, and banks still deciding what you can and cannot do.
* Crypto cards: deliver higher limits, fewer fees, global reach, and you stay in charge.

Crypto cards do not just match what banks offer, in many cases, they surpass them.

# The Future of Crypto Cards

2025 is not the end game. Stablecoins are booming, cross-border payments are exploding, and millions of new users are entering crypto every month.

Tomorrow’s crypto cards will only get smarter: broader asset support, even higher limits, and deeper integration with DeFi. If you think this is niche, think again, crypto cards are quietly becoming the new normal.

# Free Your Money

Crypto is not sitting around waiting for the old system to catch up. Neither should you.

[The best crypto cards in 2025](https://zypto.com/personal/crypto-cards/) are already here, and they are stamped with Zypto. Whether you want prepaid privacy, reloadable power, a physical card in your pocket, or a virtual card ready in minutes, Zypto has you covered.

Zypto cards are available in [Zypto App](https://zypto.com/defi-crypto-wallet-app/), and at Zypto.com.

Bypass banks. Bypass slow off-ramps. Go straight to spending with Zypto.

Talking with my therapist she was suggesting I'd give myself a reward after finishing a big task like a big tattoo design I really didn't want to draw for example. I did that once or twice and ot worked but I had to keep this budget friendly so here's what I did.
I got a whiteboard and I write down the main tasks I need to finish. I choose an amount of points like if it's something complicated 5 points, something easy 1 or 2. Not only work stuff sometimes it's just making a phone call (10 points cause I hate it). That way it's easy for me to see what I have to do first and everytime I finish something I get points. And points are basically euros. I have a list on amazon of stupid shit I want to get as a reward and what I do is work and get points and then when I know I have enough to buy something or I need a morale boost I go and choose something with those points. So dumb and simple but Ive been so productive these last few months and I am also keeping in check what I buy cause I don't just buy stuff willy nilly anymore, I wait until I have enough points. It's good cause I got things like a coffee cup or laptop stand so you also get like visual reminders that you finished stuff before. Hope this helps, it really really helped me.

We are trying to do “no screens before three” for this reason, but being flexible for intense travel days, Ms Rachel maybe for special circumstances etc. Ran into a problem because we aren’t sure about this *specific* version of a “screen”….

All the studies we read focus on tablet time (both structured and/or unrestricted) and TV watching. But I really like to have our TV on all day with an ambiance video playing from YouTube. Picture jazz music playing and an AI generated coffee shop. Or Disney area music with an image of Disney World on the screen. Most of these have constant, slow, repetitive movement from little sections of the overall image  (leaves falling, cat moving, tea steaming) but no “cuts” between shots/ images like a regular video. There is no narrative content. 

I am loath to give up my “vibes TV” but husband is very worried this screen time would impact our child.

1nd8ry8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1nd8ry8/water_damaged_pc_testing_components/,Water damaged PC testing components.,"Hi all, so pretty much as the title says, I’m currently working away and cannot get back until tomorrow, my wife just called to tell me that a pretty large cup of iced coffee has entered the chat through the top of my pc (mesh topped case) and has pretty much got on all components. She told me she turned it off by the button then wiped it all clean and tried to turn it back on before calling me.

It won’t turn on.

I know a new pc is most certainly going to be needed here, but is there any way of me figuring out if any components are still good? I don’t want to put anything old into fresh components if it could potentially blow them again. 

When I get home I’ll check fuses etc… clean everything with isopropyl and see if it boots before I order anything but judging by what I was told it’s very unlikely.  Just if I can save anything it would be most ideal!

1nd8reg,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1nd8reg/feel_hopeless/,Feel hopeless,"Guy who graduated college a little while ago and just feels lost as hell. I'm living with a parent, don't have a job, and am tired of feeling like a burden, tired of not being able to afford anything, and tired of the job search. 

I just want to move on with life, to have the money and freedom to have a space and share it with my girlfriend. We've lived together before and don't have the best relationships with our families, even if they try and support us. Financial reasons have driven us both back home. 

I try to apply and make moves for my career, but it's becoming so exhausting. Hundreds of applications for not even a call back. Online they say it's rookie numbers now. Maybe I have to do a thousand. Maybe I need to upskill or work on open source projects. Network.

But I'm so fucking tired. And no matter how much I rest, it doesn't go away. I don't have the fight in me anymore. I used it all up to just survive and graduate. I told myself it would be worth it for a good job and a good future. But now I look back and it all just feels... Hollow. Like a lie. Those sleepless nights finishing projects, the all nighters pulled studying. The nights spent in tears and frustration. 

I can't even pay my student loan dues, and have nothing to my name but my computer and my credit card debt. 

The sad part is I was actually passionate about my major. But the tech field is awful right now, along with everything else. 

So I apply to tech, and apply to whatever shitty retail job is hiring, even if it gnaws at me. Because at this point? I just need to get out of here. I need to start paying SOMETHING off. I want the freedom to just take my gf out for a coffee.

At this point, she's all I have. Her and our pets. They deserve better than this. I know I have to keep trying, for myself and for them, and I am, but not like I used to. I just don't have the fight in me anymore. And every time I do a little, it eats at me because I know Im capable of so much more. 

Getting out of bed is hard. Sending another application to the void is hard. Taking care of myself or cleaning my room is hard. Interacting with anybody and everybody is overstimulating and exhausting. 

I'm not excited to work anymore. I'll be signing my life, 8-5, Monday-friday away to some company that doesn't give a shit about me. Is that life? 

As a young person, I feel like I should be full of hope, but I don't see any. I won't ever own a house. Hell, at this rate probably won't pay off my loans. I dream of a fucking iced coffee and rent that leaves me with enough to afford a video game every few months. 

I don't think I'm alone, but damn do I feel it. I see burnout and depression everywhere. When do we get to do what makes us happy? When do we get the financial freedom to explore our hobbies and do what we are ACTUALLY passionate about? Why are we forced to choose between the time to enjoy those things and the money to actually afford them? 

Why do we introduce ourselves with ""I'm a data engineer at Meta"" instead of ""I like to play adventure RPG's and crochet cute sweaters for my cat."" 

This world is so damn cold... So disappointing. And the people that keep it that way will never have to deal with the consequences of their actions. They will never have to dream of such mundane pleasures as a coffee or coming home from work with no chores to do because they are not held by the same chains as the rest of us. Does the profit they make their shareholders make them worthy of... Living more life? 

Ive never had money, really, and I've always been able to be happy with very little. But this? When the fruits of my labor reap nothing? When I pour my heart and soul into a future that was never there? 

I feel like I'm trapped in a massive pit. I've been building this ladder for as long as I can remember. Everyone told me a ladder is how you get out of a hole, right? 

Hell, I thought it was pretty fun, studying  the manual, getting good at woodworking. And at the end? I made a pretty darn good ladder. It's sturdy and durable.

Yeah, I got a few splinters on the wood, might have a mild concussion from when I dropped it on my head that one time, but it was worth it. It should get me up no problem.

So I take it the edge and prop it up and- what the hell? Some asshole built a wall around the pit.

I look around and see everyone else is building elevators. I didn't get the memo. They tell me I need to build one too. I worked so hard on my ladder...

So I lie on my back with my headache and my splinters. Every here and there I flip through a page of engineering. 

But my head hurts, the words are blurry, and by the time I'm finished? Maybe they'll be building rocketships. ",1,1757493518.0,venting,1,1.0,False

Okay, hear me out! 🤔 Have you noticed all those accounts buzzing with success while never showing a face? It’s wild, right? You can totally grow an audience without throwing your mug all over the internet!

Now, I’m not saying to ditch your selfies forever (because, let's be honest, who doesn't love a good filter?), but there’s a whole world of *faceless* content out there that’s just waiting to be explored. And with AI on the rise, this trend is only going to get bigger. I mean, who doesn’t want to use technology to level up their game? 🚀

**Why Go Faceless? Here’s Why:**

- **Privacy is Cool!** Keeping your personal life under wraps means you can create without worrying about judgment. Want to spill your secrets about how to grow an online presence? Go for it—anonymously! 
- **Focus on the Content!** When you drop the pressure of being the “face” of your brand, you can get super creative. The *content* becomes the star of the show!
- **Less Stress!** Think about it. No need for fancy makeup, perfect lighting, or having the “right"" backdrop. Just you, your ideas, and maybe some fancy AI tools to help out. ✨

**How Can You Start? Here’s a Few Easy Steps:**

1. **Embrace AI Tools!** Use automation tools like **[this helpful guide](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/)** to help you create killer content without lifting a finger.
2. **Use Engaging Graphics**: Create infographics, slideshows, or even captivating animations. Your art can shine through – minus the face!
3. **Content Focused on Value**: Share tips, tricks, and hacks. Provide insane value that makes people think, “Wow, I needed this!”
4. **Engage Authentically**: Don’t be a faceless robot! Ask your audience questions, spark conversations, and share insights. Let them know there’s a human being (or algorithm) behind the curtain.

And just imagine the freedom! You can build a brand, create an audience, and engage with your community all while sipping coffee in your pajamas. ☕️ How great is that?

But…Are you ready to ride this wave? The faceless growth is exploding and, frankly, it’s hard to keep up. The earlier you jump on the train, the better your chances of making a splash.

So, are you in? Or is there a part of you that still thinks the selfie game is where it’s at? Let’s hear your thoughts!",1,1757493222.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

We had a casual relationship but I knew she wanted something serious. For various reasons, I could not/was not ready to commit. She was childless (like me), gainfully employed, educated, and owned her own condo. I admired her and enjoyed being with her. Five years later in 2012, I ghosted her after she initiated another conversation around our relationship status. I am sure it was hurtful to her. I had a history of running from serious conversations with her due to fear of being judged, being uncomfortable. During this entire time, I lived with my long time male best friend. I was closer to him than my own brothers. We were two bachelors in our mid 40s by the time 2016 rolled by. Also in 2016, my best friend met a woman and after 3 months, married her during a trip to Vegas. I was shocked and was concerned about how our living situation would change. My best friend and I had a disagreement related to his quick engagement and I ended up abruptly moving out; our friendship ended. He was afraid of growing old alone, which partially prompted the quick decision to marry. I began to live in a new apartment by myself. In 2017, I met a divorced woman, Rosa, with two teen girls. At this point, I was age 44, did not have children, not particularly interested in becoming a step father, but I continued to date their mother who I liked and was attracted to. I saw her every other weekend when she was children-free. She was sweet and kind, and was interested in a long term relationship. Rosa had a little bit of baggage: two time divorcee, and her last ex husband was an alcoholic who didn't always visit the children and she had to sue him for child support. Rosa asked if I was seeing anyone else and I said no (I wasn't). In early 2018, out of nowhere and after not having any contact since 2013, Summer, the woman I initially met and described above texted me a Happy Birthday message. I was surprised and flattered to hear from her. I told her I thought about her in the years we did not have contact. Not knowing I was seeing Rosa, she asked to meet for coffee. We met and caught up for 2 hours: there were lingering looks, light flirting, and I told her she still looked good. I went out to lunch with Summer and mentioned that I had been dating Rosa for a year and was only seeing her every other weekend. Summer was disappointed. Summer, like Rosa, is kind and sweet. I am sexually attracted to both. However, Summer is highly educated, travels the world, lives alone in a home she purchased, has never had children (like me), and we have similar jobs though do not work together. From 2018 to 2020, Summer and I kept in touch through random texts and I saw her a few more times. One time I went over to fix something in her bathroom; I was nervous and attracted to her and after I was finished, I immediately left to prevent anything from happening. Another time she came to my home and we talked, exchanged lingering looks and flirted but I was able to control myself. Another time I went over to her home again and we ended up in her bed and engaged in heavy foreplay but I stopped it, feeling bad because I knew Rosa would be hurt. I never told Rosa about Summer. Another time, Summer and I flirted via text and she sent me erotic photos at my request. I realized I was leading Summer on, so I ghosted Summer despite her many pleas to talk about it. Meanwhile, Rosa sensed something was jeopardizing our relationship and put pressure on me to move in with her and her teen girls. I had met the girls several times but did not have a strong relationship with them. I ended up moving in with Rosa and her girls. I thought that was the end until six months later, Summer, under a disguise, found Rosa and Rosa's children's social media pages and began to indicate that I had been cheating on Rosa, calling our phones from blocked numbers but not leaving messages, and letting Rosa know she had an intimate relationship with me. At one point, Summer threatened to post texts/photos/screenshots to prove it, but has not. Rosa has no idea who this is and I do not have the guts to tell her. Some would feel Summer's reaction was warranted the interactions we had and my subsequent ghosting. I can tell Rosa has told her girls about this ""drama"" and her girls are looking at me differently. Rosa has begged me to tell her the truth but I continue to say I do not know anything about it. I will not contact Summer as I know I was wrong. Summer did not let up and Rosa began to pressure marriage. I agreed to it and we rushed to plan a wedding. I have not had contact with Summer but she continues to find creative ways to let Rosa know she has intimate knowledge of me such as sending Rosa an old photo of me via Instagram. Rosa loves me and together, especially with my large salary, it afforded us a newly built, big home with a pool and overall financial security. Rosa feels I know who is behind the cryptic yet accurate messages and has threatened to hire a private investigator to reveal who this mystery woman. What should I do at this point?

1nd8mt7,https://i.redd.it/83qpd9nmsaof1.jpeg,Review #47: Wire Works Necessary Evil (English Whisky),"**The Maker**

In recent years it's almost become a cliché to say that England is the most exciting part of the UK whisky industry. Yet in many respects it's well deserved praise with distilleries as varied as the Spirit of Yorkshire and Circumstance in Bristol bringing forward exciting and innovative releases to bolster the sector alongside established names like [Cotswolds](https://tripletipple.wixsite.com/tripletipple/post/cotswolds-madeira-cask-distillery-exclusive) and Bimber.

In any such discussion it isn't long before somebody mentions White Peak Distillery in Derbyshire, or how it's more commonly known: Wire Works.

White Peak Distillery can be found in Ambergate on the edge of the Peak District National Park. I have a natural soft spot for the area as I married into a Derbyshire family based just a few minutes up the road in Ripley. As a result I like to treat White Peak as my second local distillery after [Penderyn](https://tripletipple.wixsite.com/tripletipple/post/penderyn-icons-of-wales-no-7-rhiannon), and have been keenly waiting for its whiskies to mature ever since I first heard production had begun.

That production got underway in 2016 when local couple Max and Claire Vaughan established the distillery at a disused wire factory (hence the name and twisted glass bottle design) on the banks of the river Derwent. In 2022 the first whisky was released and was soon picking up awards from the usual 'pay-to-play' industry heavyweights. 

Yet while the awards themselves might not mean a huge amount, what does is the reception the whisky has had from the online community, with bottlings appearing frequently on several online tastings and reviews channels over the past few years. In the time since White Peak have managed to develop a healthy core range of batch releases that show off various finishes and maturations. 

**The Expression**

Given the local history of great beer the obvious choice to make when looking at the range was the Necessary Evil Stout Finish. This from the second batch and bought in December 2023 (to be precise bottle number 2053/2553) at a strength of 51.3%.

This is a lightly peated spirit that spent the bulk of it's maturation in ex-bourbon barrels from the Heaven Hill distillery in Kentucky. We don't know how long this maturation was (beyond it being at least three years), but we do know it was then transferred into ex-stout barrels from Thornbridge brewery near Bakewell for several additional months. As you'd expect from the name these are the same barrels that Thornbridge has previously used to mature their Necessary Evil stout over a period of 8 months.

What's left is presented in natural colour and without chill-filtration at a price in the region of £65. 

**The Neck Pour**

The stout is instantly present on the nose. If it were possible to smell 'thick and creamy' this would be it. This is followed by plenty of malt powder and the burn of alcohol from the cask strength. Yet these notes are followed by a rich sweetness that's reminiscent of dark cherries and blackcurrant.

On the palate it's much sweeter than I expected. Indeed I'd even go so far as to say that there's a hefty dose of Calpol to it. Maybe even edging toward a blackcurrant throat sweet. Basically it’s got a sweet medicinal quality.

The peat is there but is relatively subtle in following along. The finish in contrast heads towards citrus and burnt tangerine peel. All rather nice and very different to other things I'm drinking from the shelf right now.

**The Body** 

Several months from opening that thick creamy lactose note is all the stronger and still followed by those deep dark sugars notes that approach black forest gateau. Yet that citrus finish has become more present in the form of bitter hops.

The palate is still very sweet but with added cereal notes. There's increasing depth with oxidisation which is all the more impressive from what is fundamentally still a very young spirit from a relatively new distillery. There’s also now a nice dose of char on the finish alongside those bitter hops. Almost smoky. Reminds me a bit of a young [Glen Scotia](https://tripletipple.wixsite.com/tripletipple/post/glen-scotia-victoriana).

**Final Thoughts** 

I'm sad to be coming to the end of this bottle a good 18 months after first opening it. I’ve enjoyed it throughout, yet it’s never been one I’ve reached for first. That's largely down to it being that little bit different via the stout and rarely what I'm after when I fancy whisky rather than beer.

That said, as an example of a stout finish it’s definitely the best I’ve had. That thick creamy texture has continued throughout with the sweetness, and the bitterness which has only built with time. By the end it's all coming together like a rich liquorish and used coffee grains.

My main takeaway from this is that it tastes like a much more mature whisky than it is. It isn't much older than three years, yet it has the depth and integration of flavour that I’d associate with something in its teens. There’s a refinement here you don’t get with lightly peated scotches of a similar age. It’s very impressive and bodes well for the future. English whisky continues to impress.

It is actually much much better now with no sugar drops! I did not know the milk of the coffee could throw my body so out of it. But I feel much better these days, no migraines so far, nothing, so far so good! It has been 2 weeks :)

  
Now, as many of you here, I would like to drop some weight. Just a bit to get back to pre-pregnancies' weight. My healthy weight is 56kg / 123lbs, I am at 58kg / 128lbs, which is not a  lot, but you notice it on the pants, I have pants for when I gain weight and for when I loose. I hate going shopping for clothes, so I love what I have and would like to fit again. 

  
I do not exercise, But I live a very active lifestyle with children. So I am on my feet 6am - 9am when I finally sit at my desk. I am a librarian which also means going often down to the storage and around for the books. Then 4.30pm - 7pm when they finally sleep, with the exception of dinner, I am on my feet (picking them up, shopping, cooking). And I bike to and form work a total of 30 minutes. M,T,T and F, Wed I am off and weekends it depends on what we do. But you can say my normal step count is somewhere in 15K+ per day.

  
My question is, when it comes to exercise, is this activity enough to compensate for no standard workouts? Most people I see here are working out, like a lot more than I am able to with my time. Which makes me feel like I am slacking and I won't see any drop in weight in a year. Sometimes my feet hurt so much I cannot think of possibly squishing in any extra workout.

  
I guess I am just looking for some reassurance... Thanks!",1,1757492975.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

You Can Literally Get Paid to Smash Buttons & Complain About Apps—No Experience Needed! 🤯💸,"Umm, someone needs to explain to me WHY nobody’s talking about how absolutely INSANE beta tester jobs are right now. Like… HOW is “testing apps for cash” a real thing you can just DO? With no experience? Am I missing something here, or did the internet just low-key hand everyone a starter pack to make money from their phone??

So here’s what happened:

I was doom-scrolling, feeling dangerously close to just napping through my productivity goals, when I fell into this rabbit hole: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. 

I mean, they literally connect you with apps begging for humans to give them feedback—feedback you could toss out while you, I don’t know, watch Netflix. Or eat cereal in your pajamas. 

Let me hit you with the facts I pretty much SCREAMED out loud when I found out 😳:

- Experience? HA. Companies DON’T CARE. If you can navigate an app and have an opinion, you’re overqualified.
- Sessions can be 10-30 minutes, and payouts range from “did I just pay off my coffee habit?” to “wait, this is actually making a dent in my bills??”
- New apps are hunting for users to spot bugs, UX fails, confusing stuff, whatever. They WANT FRESH EYES.
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is, no joke, just handing out the signup. Why are we NOT all over this?
- Payments? So many use PayPal, Venmo, even gift cards.
- No résumé, no interviews, no HR lady staring you down about your “greatest weakness.”

And the icing on this absolutely wild cake?

People are getting paid (like, real money) to just BREAK things. Or click random features and go, “Hmm, I think this button is ugly.” Excuse me… since WHEN is ranting about app colors a side hustle?!

Tips for anyone who still thinks this isn’t legit (…it is!):

- Stick to sites that don’t ask you to pay up-front. Legit listings like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** pop their jobs up daily.
- Have a PayPal or Venmo ready—the easier you can get paid, the better.
- Take a screenshot if you find bugs! Some places literally bonus you for it. 
- Write your feedback like you’re talking to a friend—honest, chill, real. That’s what developers want.
- Sign up for notifications so you can grab the newest gigs before the vultures (I say this lovingly to everyone here).

Am I shocked this is a side hustle? Absolutely. Am I hyped to keep testing apps and getting paid to complain? You have no idea.

Anyway, my mind is still blown 🤯

Like... where was THIS opportunity when I was struggling to find anything that paid over minimum wage? 

TLDR: Beta tester jobs? Minimal effort. Free to start. Pretty fun. Maybe a little addictive. Shoot your shot at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and try not to be personally offended that nobody told you sooner. 

Who else is doing this??

The foundation of an effective teeth hygiene routine begins with understanding the basic principles of oral care. Dental professionals recommend a multi-step approach that addresses different aspects of mouth health and prevents potential issues before they develop.

Key Components of an Optimal Teeth Hygiene Routine

1. Brushing Techniques
Proper brushing is the cornerstone of dental care. Here are essential techniques to maximize your oral hygiene:

• Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
• Brush at a 45-degree angle to the gums
• Use gentle, circular motions
• Brush for at least two minutes
• Replace your toothbrush every three to four months

2. Choosing the Right Toothpaste
Not all toothpastes are created equal. Look for options that:

• Contain fluoride
• Address specific dental concerns
• Have ADA (American Dental Association) approval
• Match your specific oral health needs

Advanced Oral Care Strategies

Flossing: The Overlooked Hero of Dental Hygiene
Many people neglect flossing, but it's crucial for removing plaque and food particles between teeth. Statistics show that only 30% of Americans floss daily, leaving the majority vulnerable to dental issues.

Recommended Flossing Techniques:
• Use 18 inches of floss
• Slide gently between teeth
• Curve the floss around each tooth
• Use a clean section of floss for each tooth

Mouthwash and Additional Protection

**Mouthwash isn't just for fresh breath.** It provides additional protection against bacteria and can help:
• Reduce plaque
• Prevent gingivitis
• Strengthen tooth enamel
• Reach areas brushing might miss

Nutrition and Oral Health Connection

Your diet plays a significant role in dental hygiene. Foods and drinks can either support or damage your oral health:

Teeth-Friendly Foods:
• Calcium-rich dairy products
• Crunchy fruits and vegetables
• Green and black teas
• Water

Foods to Limit:
• Sugary snacks
• Acidic beverages
• Sticky candies
• Excessive coffee

Professional Dental Care

Regular dental check-ups are non-negotiable. Dentists recommend:
• Bi-annual professional cleanings
• Annual comprehensive dental exams
• X-rays every 1-2 years
• Immediate attention to any dental discomfort

Special Considerations for Different Age Groups

Dental care needs change throughout life:
• Children: Focus on establishing good habits
• Teenagers: Address orthodontic concerns
• Adults: Prevent wear and decay
• Seniors: Manage specific dental health challenges

Technology and Modern Dental Care

Emerging technologies are revolutionizing dental hygiene:
• Electric toothbrushes with advanced cleaning modes
• Water flossers
• Smartphone apps tracking oral hygiene
• Advanced dental imaging techniques

Common Mistakes to Avoid

• Brushing too hard
• Ignoring your tongue
• Using the wrong toothbrush
• Storing toothbrush improperly
• Neglecting regular dental visits

Final Thoughts on Teeth Hygiene

Developing an exceptional teeth hygiene routine requires commitment, knowledge, and consistent practice. By implementing these strategies, you'll not only improve your oral health but also boost your overall well-",1,1757492926.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

I read 1 book about IF and am starting 1 about prediabetes, but I wanted to hear from real people.

Does anyone have experience with IF and prediabetes or even diabetes? If IF did anything for you in regards to reversing prediabetes or maintaining your health in regards to diabetes and if this is the right lifestyle. 

I've never been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes but I know it's possible I could be since I am at high risk according to my research. I at least think I'm prediabetic but I'm scared to visit a doctor for an official diagnosis. (More on this later)

I do eat a balanced meal sometimes but I still had too much of this or that and a sugary coffee and candies and take out fast food but now I am taking things more seriously. 

I've reduced the amount of processed foods in my home. I'm following portion sizes. I set up an exercise routine. I have more accountability for myself to get those last few habits cleaned up. And decided to take another go at IF

I don't know a lot but my plan is as follows: 

For me to be in an ""average"" weight range for my stats(age, height, sex ps I know these things aren't accurate but it's a start) I need to lose approximately 40-60 lbs 

I will lose 40lbs with balanced whole meals, light to moderate exercise, and Intermittent fasting. 

I don't care for a time frame as this is a lifestyle change and will be more permanent than anything, but if I were to guess I would predict it taking 6 months ????? 
 
I know I should consult with a doctor. I feel fine when I fast just hungry and ... vulnerable? Lol I am hoping when I accomplish these changes and goals I at least won't be as scared to make an appointment I would feel like I stand a chance. 

So I'd love to hear from anyone who can relate thanks : )

I just wanted to share something big - I’ve finally signed a place in London and I’ll be moving at the end of October. Since 18 to 29 I've been forced to be Muslim to appease my family and moved out aged 29 into a new place but still in my hometown where my fam live. I wanted to test the waters and tbh I don't miss them at all (except the nieces/nephews who are innocent) so I am ready to finally move a lot further away. It’s a huge step for me because it means real independence and also cutting off ties with my family, which has been long overdue.

I can’t even explain how relieved and excited I feel to be moving forward with my life after years of pretending, pressure, and being stuck around people who didn’t really support me. I also feel gratitude for this sub for helping me throughout tough times and also feel lucky because I know there are people in worse spots and my heart aches for you <3

I’d love to connect with others in the ex Muslim community once I’m in London! it would be amazing to meet up, share experiences, and build some healthier connections.

If anyone’s around London and up for coffee, a walk, or just hanging out, let me know :)

1nd8jsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/buyforlifetips/comments/1nd8jsv/my_300_boots_have_cost_me_027_per_wear_how_do_you/,My $300 boots have cost me $0.27 per wear - how do you explain BIFL math to skeptics?,"So I was having coffee with my brother yesterday and mentioned I was thinking about getting another pair of Red Wings for rotation. He nearly choked when I said they cost around $350 now. ""You spent THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS on work boots?! I get mine at Walmart for $40!""

This triggered my spreadsheet brain, so I pulled out my phone and did the math right there. I bought my Iron Rangers in January 2021 for $299 (got them on a slight sale). I wear them probably 4 days a week on average - to work, on weekends, pretty much whenever it's not scorching hot. That's roughly 1,100 wears over 3 years, which comes out to $0.27 per wear. And here's the thing - they're not even close to done. The soles have plenty of life left, the leather looks better than when I bought them, and Red Wing will resole them for $100 when the time comes.

Meanwhile, my brother admitted he goes through those $40 Walmart boots about every 4 months. That's $120 per year, or $360 over the same 3 years. His cost per wear is actually higher than mine, PLUS he's had to break in 9 different pairs of boots, dealt with wet feet every time it rains, and his back hurts because they have zero support.

But even with the math right in front of him, he still thinks I'm crazy. The upfront cost is just this huge mental barrier. I tried explaining that it's like buying a car - nobody says ""I can't afford a $20,000 car"" and then goes out and buys a $500 beater every month when it breaks down. But somehow with everything else, the sticker shock wins.

I've had similar conversations about my Darn Tough socks ($20 each but lifetime warranty), my Vitamix ($400 but cheaper than replacing a blender every 2 years), and especially my $1,200 Herman Miller chair that saved me from physical therapy bills. The chair one really gets people riled up.

The frustrating part is watching people I care about waste money on disposable crap while complaining they can't afford quality items. My coworker complains about being broke but has bought four different ""cheap"" office chairs from Amazon this year because they keep breaking. That's $600 on garbage chairs when she could've bought something decent once.

I've tried different approaches:

* Cost per use calculations (what I did with my brother)
* Total cost of ownership over 5-10 years
* The environmental angle about keeping stuff out of landfills
* Quality of life improvements (comfort, reliability, not having to shop for replacements constantly)
* The time value of not having to research and buy the same item repeatedly

Sometimes I feel like the Sam Vimes ""Boots Theory of Economic Injustice"" perfectly explains it, but Terry Pratchett references don't land with everyone.

1nd8hbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nd8hbe/eyeless_jack_the_good_doctor_rewrite/,Eyeless Jack: The Good Doctor [REWRITE],"I can’t remember the last time I slept. Four nights now, he’s been there. He doesn’t move, doesn’t speak—he only stares.
My name is Dr. Jack Martolov, retired surgeon and former professor at Bridgewood Medical School. Twenty-eight years ago, I traded the operating room for the lecture hall, believing I could pass my skills on to the next generation. I’m sixty-three now, near the end of whatever life I have left. But that doesn’t matter anymore, does it?
The encounters began only four nights ago—September 5th, a date etched into me like a scar. The first wasn’t even terrifying, at least not at first. Just a knock at the door, childish almost, a simple ding-dong-ditch. But when I opened the door, there was no one there. Only a single sticky note left on the step.
It read: “I remember your hands.”
The handwriting unsettled me more than the words themselves—sloppy yet deliberate, as if someone tried to print with perfect precision but couldn’t quite hold steady.
The second occurrence happened that very same night. My wife and I had gone to bed, sometime before midnight, the room was swallowed in darkness. What struck me as strange was that I awoke at all—I never do. Something felt wrong, as though a pair of unseen eyes lingered on me from across the room. Yet when I looked, there was nothing.
I sighed, blaming my nerves, when I heard it. A sound I knew instantly didn’t belong. It wasn’t the house settling. It wasn’t the neighbor’s dog. No—it was something else. Something that should not exist.
It sounded like a corpse struggling to remember how to breathe—rasping, broken, labored. The sound came from the only window without a curtain.
A hulking figure stood there, silhouetted against the dim glow of the porch light. His shape blocked out every ray, making it impossible to discern any details—only that he was the source of that unnatural, disgusting sound.
Then, as suddenly as he appeared, he was gone. I couldn’t even comprehend what had just happened before the void where he had been was empty. Heart racing, I sprang from bed and ran to the front door. There, waiting for me, was another sticky note. It read: “I watched you sleep. You flinch too easily.” 
The note was on my side of the front door…inside. I called the police, of course. When they finally arrived, it was two officers. One wore a shirt soaked with sweat, like he’d been baking under the sun all day. The other was tall and lanky, his presence oddly imposing.
The lanky one stepped forward first.
“Evening. I’m Officer Jackson, and this is my partner, Officer Mack.”
“Oh, thank God you’re here! There’s been a break-in and—” I started, words tumbling out fast, panic rising.
Jackson held up a hand, cutting me off gently.
“Woah, woah, slow down. Try again—we can barely understand you.”
My wife stood beside me, her hand pressed gently against my side, obviously roused from sleep by my frantic screaming. She had no idea what had happened, what—or who—had invaded our home…my life, my intimate life. I calmed down before speaking again.
“Someone—or something—broke into my house and left me a note! And… and before that I woke up, and he was outside my bedroom window, just… staring at me!” I proceeded to show them the note I had put it on the coffee table nearby.
The officers stared at the note for a moment, then back at me, their faces blank but clearly confused. My wife kept rubbing my back, murmuring something comforting I barely registered.
“Could you give us a description of the person? Approximate height?” Officer Jackson asked, pulling out a pen and notepad.
I struggled to focus, groggy and shaken, my mind still trying to make sense of what I’d seen. My hands trembled as I spoke.
“He… he had to be over six feet, a heavier-looking guy. I could barely make out what he was wearing… all I know is that it was mostly black.”
The officer scribbled down the details, knowing how little I could give him. He looked back up at me, his gaze sharp, almost surgical.
“With what you’ve told us, the most I can do is send an officer out here for a few nights,” he said. “That’s really all I can do… I’m sorry. Maybe install some cameras in the meantime.”
With that, both officers left, leaving my wife and me alone, defenseless, in the dead of night. Suddenly, the house didn’t feel like home anymore. It felt like a cage, and I was a cornered animal, trapped. Primal fear consumed me.
The next morning, my wife and I drove out and picked up some security cameras. The only ones they had in stock were old, cheap models that barely worked—but at this point, anything was better than living in constant fear.
When we finally got back home, I stepped out of the car and froze. Something felt… wrong. Nothing obvious, nothing I could point to, just a gnawing twist in my gut.
“Stay here. Don’t move, have to check something out”
With that, I stepped out of my car, moving slowly toward the closed garage. My hand trembled as I pressed the button, and the door groaned to life. The screech of metal grinding upward echoed in my ears, too loud, too sharp.
As the darkness inside was revealed, a wave of stench hit me—rancid, suffocating. It was the reek of spoiled meat mixed with the stinging rot of a filthy public restroom. My stomach churned before I even dared to take a step closer.
I stepped inside, cautious, before something brushed against my shoulder. I jerked back, heart racing, and flicked on the light.
What I saw made my stomach lurch.
Hanging from the ceiling was the strung-up carcass of a raccoon, its body slack and grotesque. The stench hit me full force, rotten and suffocating, and I stumbled outside, gagging until bile burned my throat.
When I finally gathered the nerve to return, I stepped back into the garage, my legs unsteady. This time, I forced myself to look closer.
That’s when I realized.
The animal hadn’t been slaughtered randomly. The cuts were deliberate—clean, exact, as if it had been laid out on an operating table. Every organ was missing but the lungs, hollowing its body into a grotesque display. And buried within the cavity, tucked inside the wound, was another sticky note.
It read: “precision is everything..don’t you agree Doctor?”
I knew exactly who had done this. That same man from the night before—he was playing with my mind, pulling me apart piece by piece, making me live in constant fear. He knew my past. He knew me. But I didn’t know him. Not a clue.
After reading the note, I yanked the carcass down and shoved it into the trash bin outside. I couldn’t bring myself to tell my wife; no sense in dragging her into this nightmare.
I walked back to the car and slid into the driver’s seat, pulling it into the garage. As I parked, my wife, sitting quietly beside me, spoke up.
“Are you alright, honey? You don’t look well.” She rested her hand gently on mine.
“I’m fine,” I lied, forcing a small smile. “Just… worked up, that’s all.”
I laced my fingers with hers, leaning over to press a quick kiss against her cheek, trying to convince her—and myself—that everything was normal.
The moment we got inside, I set to work. Every lock was checked, every window shut tight. It took me nearly half an hour, but by the end of it the cameras were up, each one linked through a cheap little app on my phone.
I went down the list, cycling through each feed to make sure they worked. One, two, three—clear enough, even if the quality was grainy. But when I tapped the fourth camera, the screen stayed black. No signal.
I let out a heavy sigh, running a hand over my face. Should’ve gone somewhere else, should’ve bought better ones. Too late for that now. All I could do was pray—pray that whoever was stalking me, stalking us, would finally lose interest and leave us alone.
Night crept in again, heavy and suffocating. I hadn’t slept—hadn’t even napped—since waking past midnight to that unwelcome figure at my window. Exhaustion gnawed at me until, slouched in my office chair, I finally dozed off.
I woke to a sharp crackle of sound. The cameras. Their audio had picked something up.
A low, steady rumble.
I blinked, disoriented, before realizing—it was a car. Somewhere just outside. I cycled through the feeds, heart hammering, but the vehicle was out of view. The only thing I saw was light. Twin beams flooding the driveway. Headlights. Pointed straight at my house.
I crept into the kitchen and peeked through the window, my throat tightening as I swallowed hard. Who the hell would come to my house this late at night?
The clock on the stove read 11:43 PM. Almost midnight.
When I glanced back at the driveway, the car was no longer idling. It had been shut off, swallowed whole by the darkness. The vehicle sat there, still and silent, as if it were watching me.
I froze. My body refused to move. I just stood there, waiting—waiting for the door to open, for someone to step out, for something.
But nothing came.
Minutes dragged like hours. Exactly twelve, I would later learn. And then, just as suddenly, the engine rumbled back to life. The car rolled away slowly, headlights still dark, disappearing into the night as if it had never been there at all.
I let out a shaky sigh, convincing myself that nothing else would happen that night. Finally, I was about to turn in, to crawl into bed and try to forget the terror outside…
Then I heard it.
Footsteps. Slow, deliberate, echoing beneath me. From the basement.
Our basement hadn’t been used in years, a graveyard of forgotten junk, boxes, and furniture long abandoned. It could be accessed from outside, yes—but it was locked. How?
Panic clawed at my chest as I pressed my ear to the floor, listening to the faint thud of movement below. Whoever—or whatever—was down there, they shouldn’t be.
Suddenly, the thuds shifted, quickening. Running. Heavy, relentless, heading straight for the stairwell—the one that led into my house, my safe haven.
I bolted toward it, heart hammering, lungs burning. I threw my weight against the door, bracing myself.
The footsteps stopped.
Silence.
And then…that breathing. God-awful, ragged, unnatural—the same sound I’d heard outside my window only a night ago.
Then it spoke.
A wet, gravelly voice, dripping with malice and hatred. Every syllable seemed to crawl under my skin, freezing me in place.
Fear coiled tight in my chest—and lower. My body betrayed me, trembling uncontrollably as I realized just how close it was.
“Did you miss me, Doctor?” the voice rasped, wet and coarse.
I swallowed hard, unable to answer.
“You thought you were safe…thought you could lock me out,” it continued, each word deliberate, dripping with mockery. “But I always find my way in.”
I took a shaky step back, hands pressed against the door.
“You taught me everything,” it hissed. “And now…you’re my next lesson.”
It let out a cold, hollow laugh, the kind that felt like ice crawling down my spine, a sound that threatened more than it entertained.
“What do you want?! Who are you?! WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US?!” I yelled, my voice breaking.
The thing’s rasping voice answered, dripping with mockery:
“Ohohoh… you’ll find out… in due time.”
With that, I heard him retreat. Footsteps faded, then the unmistakable creak of the cellar door outside opening… and slamming shut.
I had just come face-to-face with my tormentor, and no one would ever believe me.
A low growl rose from my chest, turning into a yell of pure frustration and fear. My fist slammed against the door, splintering wood beneath my knuckles. A crack ran through it, followed by a jagged hole, my anger leaving its mark.
I stayed awake the rest of the night, the thing’s voice echoing in my mind. Even thinking about it made my skin crawl.
By morning, my wife found me at the computer, eyes fixed on the security feed. She slid a gentle hand around my shoulder.
“Honey… you’re up early. Are you alright?” she asked, then glanced toward the damaged door. Her frown deepened.
“I-I’m fine… just wanted to get some work done early,” I lied, my voice tight. The truth would terrify her more than the past few days already had.
Maybe I was being paranoid. Maybe this was all some sick prank. But I couldn’t take any chances. I had to stay and watch. I wasn’t risking it—not for me, not for my safety, but for my wife. Quickly I ran to the cellar door outside and locked it.
Rain pelted the house all day, turning every shadow darker, making the rooms feel colder even with the lights on. Maybe it would deter him, at least for one night.
I was exhausted—two sleepless nights catching up with me. Things kept flickering at the edges of my vision, shapes popping into view only to vanish when I looked directly. My mind raced. Was I seeing things? Or was he already inside?
My wife came up beside me, her voice gentle.
“I’m gonna go run a few errands. I’ll be back in a few hours. Try to get some sleep, okay?” She caressed my cheek, her hand warm and soft against my cold skin.
“I’ll try,” I murmured, holding her hand there for a moment longer before finally letting her go.
I listened as the door shut, the car started, and her tires faded down the street. The silence that followed pressed heavy on me. My eyes grew heavier still. I fought it, but the weight was too much.
Before I knew it, I was asleep.
I woke up what felt like hours later. The clock read 4 PM. I’d gone to sleep around 10 that morning—so why was I still so tired? My body felt heavy, wrong.
I tried to stand, but a sharp pain shot through my side, stealing the breath from my lungs. It wasn’t the sting of a bruise, nor the shallow bite of a cut—it was deeper.
My hand went instinctively to my side. I froze. Hot, wet liquid seeped between my fingers, slow and steady. Blood. My blood.
I looked down and almost gagged.
A line of stitches crawled up my side. Some neat, some sloppy, all horribly precise. Like I’d been opened and sewn shut again by hands that knew exactly what they were doing.
I turned toward my desk and froze. Both monitors were shattered, glass scattered across the floor. My computer was nothing but wreckage. And on the desk—two sticky notes.
The first one read: “Missing something, Doctor?”
The second was worse—a crude drawing of a kidney, jagged and childlike, but unmistakable.
My stomach lurched. That bastard had taken my kidney.
I collapsed forward, retching. Acid and copper burned my throat as bile and blood poured from my mouth. The room spun, vision blurring, until minutes later I was sprawled in a foul, sticky pool of my own vomit, trembling and broken.
Slowly, I forced myself to stand, every movement a struggle. I stumbled to the closet and grabbed the mop bucket, gagging as I cleaned up the mess, the stench clinging to my nostrils.
Once the vomit was gone, I stumbled into the shower, letting the hot water wash away the bile and grime. Dressed and somewhat composed, I grabbed the phone and called the police again.
Officer Jackson arrived, alone this time. I exhaled shakily and stepped forward to meet him.
“Officer Jackson! It’s him again! He took my kidney—and destroyed my computer!”
Jackson’s eyes widened. He exhaled, then pulled out his flashlight, scanning the house methodically before moving forward.
“Stay here, sir. I’ll be back.”
And just like that, he was gone, walking into the trap of a house already torn apart by some meticulous, sick predator—someone who had already taken pieces of me, and might be ready to take more.
My chest tightened. Another piece of me was missing. My wife… where was she? Where had he taken her?
Minutes—or hours, I couldn’t tell—passed in torturous silence before Officer Jackson returned, holding a single sticky note between his fingers. My face darkened instantly.
“I only found this… does it mean anything to you?” he asked, holding it out.
I leaned forward, heart hammering, and read the note. It said;
“I know what you value most…and I have it”
My wife… my wife was in danger, and I had no clue where she was. The woman I had spent half my life with—gone. Missing. Or worse.
“That son of a bitch… he has my wife… HE HAS HER!” I shouted, my voice cracking.
Jackson stepped forward, firm but calm.
“Slow down! Calm down and think!”
I couldn’t think. How could I? This man had torn my life apart in just three days. I was drowning in panic, in helpless rage, unable to breathe.
“IF YOU CAN’T STOP HIM, I WILL”
The officer stepped back, one hand resting lightly on his pistol, ready just in case I snapped. I wouldn’t hurt him—not really. After all, he wasn’t the one who had kidnapped my wife, wasn’t the one doing God knows what to her.
Jackson let out a long sigh.
“I’ll help you. Whatever I can… within my jurisdiction, of course.”
Hours later, after he had left, the house was suffocatingly silent. The stillness pressed in from all sides, filling my ears, my mind. Alone, I sat in the darkness, my thoughts spiraling—my past, my career, where had I gone wrong? How has my life to this?
There was one student I’ll never forget… It was sixteen years ago. His name was Jackie Maidstone. Scrawny, quiet, introverted—but brilliant. One of my best pupils.
That was… until. Until it happened.
Sometime after the first half of the second semester, officers investigated his car. Inside, they found a collection of dead animal carcasses—small ones, large ones—all dissected with meticulous precision. Every organ removed.
Jackie… Jackie… It was him. My star pupil. The one behind the notes. The one who left that raccoon in my garage. The one who kidnapped my wife.
As I wrote, my mind spiraled, searching for where I went wrong… where I could have helped him.
And then I felt it—a gloved hand, cold and firm, wrapping around my throat. Darkness swallowed me.
Jack and Mabel Martolov were later found in their home. Their organs had been removed with surgical precision, leaving only their hearts and lungs intact. The cuts were clean, exact, made with a scalpel or razor. There were no signs of struggle; they had likely been unconscious.
In their own blood, scrawled across the walls, the words read:
“THE GOOD DOCTOR.”

I’m pretty new to specialty coffee—only started messing with pour-overs a few months ago and quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing. Ratios, bloom times, pour patterns… felt like I was drowning in variables.

So, being a dev, I built an app to help me figure it out. It’s called [**Cofy Cat**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cofy-cat/id6751729402).

# What it does

* Step-by-step water animations so I don’t mess up timing
* Recipe tracking with exact ratios so I can actually repeat the good ones
* Taste notes with sliders (still not sure I understand what “body” means)
* Brew summaries that look like receipts (kinda fun)
* Works with V60, Chemex, Aeropress, and probably more as I keep learning

# Learning side

* Logs beans, roaster, origin, processing (I had to Google “anaerobic”)
* History + ratings so I can see if I’m actually improving
* Simple profile stats to keep track of total brews and patterns

Right now it’s iOS only (Android soon). It’s free—I’m more interested in feedback than anything.

So, for those of you who know way more than me:

* What features would actually help you?
* What mistakes do beginners usually make that an app could prevent?
* What am I probably doing wrong without even realizing it?

Would love to hear your thoughts. I’ve already learned a ton just lurking here.

TL;DR: Newbie dev made a free iOS brewing app (Cofy Cat) to stop wasting good beans. Looking for feedback from people who actually know what they’re doing.
