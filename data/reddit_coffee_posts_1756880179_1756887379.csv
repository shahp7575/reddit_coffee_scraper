So the algorithm, right? That skibidi gaslighting void. It needs constant feeding. And my mom… my mom’s medical stuff, it’s… it’s expensive. And at the time my channel did that little fish flop on the dock thing. 

Anyway.

I am not even good at writing. This post started as a GPT prompt, *Write a short scary story about the* *Cedar Glen disappearances for narration*.  

The answer? *Give me two days. And I will craft a banger. Would you like a notification when I’m done?*

Two days? Bet. Let it cook. But when I read it my blood went cold. Like super based. It was so specific. It talked about the mud, gave times, referenced articles… it wasn’t a story. It was a manual. And I was like, The algorithm is going to vomit views all over this.

And it did. It literally did. The video slayed. We’re talking sponsorships, collabs, subathons and monetization. I paid off my mom’s medical debt. She called me a hero. I was a genius. I won the internet.

But I got greedy. Of course. That’s the whole point of the game, right? Get greedy or get left behind. So I decided to do a follow-up. A live unboxing. I went deep. Like, deep deep. Down the kind of rabbit hole requiring an onion browser and a VPN. Extra delulu for clicks. Which, no cap, was cringe. So that happened.

The box arrived, plain and brown strangled by tape with no return address. I set up the stream, thousands of people waited.

“I ordered a box from the dark web so you don’t have to… What’s in the box, gang? What’s in the box?” I snapped the wrist of my latex glove.

The chat bursted in a blur of emojis. 

Slicing it opened, I threw up in my mouth a little from the musty smell. 

A box of sus. Pinching out a crusty bracelet, I put it in the discard pile. The class ring hugged my ring finger, so I kept it. But I knew. The second I saw the old photo of the local haunted campground, I knew. This junk matched the details of my story. Some troll figured out a way to make me cringe. The chat didn’t know. They thought it was a bit. 

They spammed *Ls,* *Ws* and skull emojis. 

Staring into this box of someone else’s life, it felt like watching a snuff film.

I tossed it all out. Obviously. Went and touched grass.

The police pulled me out of class a few days later. Took my phone, put me in handcuffs. Questioned me for hours, about people who disappeared last year from the campground. Talking about I knew unreleased details from the cases. Claimed the ring and bracelet from the unboxing belonged to missing persons. Flipped my room upside down looking for more evidence. Kicked my mom out of our house while they searched. I know my rights. Told them about the AI and darkweb.

“Not enough evidence. Circumstantial,” they said. 

But the detectives… they think I did it. 

Somebody tagged me in a post about what happened to me. At first I thought my followers rallied for me. But the title read*, The StoryCrypt Killer: An Analysis.* 

My channel got demonetized. I think the cops doxed me. I can’t leave my house. Not because of the police. Because of the clout chasers. They stand on the sidewalk,  streaming lives, pointing at my windows. 

“Hey, guys, Storytime. DramaDude93 here, coming at you LIVE from the doorstep of a YouTube serial killer…” 

Their cameras sucking the light out of everything. Monetizing my death spiral. Reducing my existence to an engagement metric.

My mom… clueless. She coughs over the bills crowding the coffee table. Tells me how proud she is of me. How I’m her hero. Every I love you sounds like a goodbye.

And in my house. No longer home. It’s a set. And the vultures circle. And the only thing left to unbox… is me.",1,1756886773.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1n78u6g,https://i.redd.it/jvn6avl0pwmf1.jpeg,"[Collection] ""Two worlds"" or my ""collection-diary"".","Hello, I am Alex, I am 35 years old, and I am from Ukraine. I have loved watches for as long as I can remember. My first watches were Chinese fakes when I was a child. This hobby sometimes drags me in, sometimes it lets me go, but one thing is constant - there is always some watch on my wrist.

So I got carried away again and decided to present my collection. I don't know how anyone does it, but I have something connected with each watch, it's memories or something memorable.

So, I’d like to tell you about my collection.

**Swatch YAS100G**

My first ""adult"" watch. I begged it from my parents when I was a teenager, it wasn't very convenient to check the time on it, but it created a ""wow"" effect, and what else does a young guy need?)

**Swatch Fun Scuba**

Somewhere around the same time, I was stuck with my mom at the airport (maybe it was Antalya) where I was wandering around duty-free shops with nothing to do and found these beauties at some obscenely low price. The joke is that when I bought them, I didn't fully understand that they were for diving. But over time, my dad got into diving and got me into it too. Well, I don't have many, only about 100 dives, (these are the Red Sea and Malaysia) and I never had a dive computer, I always dived with these Swatches. Of course, there were exceptions when I was forced to rent a computer, but it was rare.

**Tissot PR100 T049.410.11.032.00**

During the same trips to Malaysia, a friend who was knowledgeable about Swiss watches flew with us, and at the Sri Lankan airport, I think I bought a PR100 on his advice. And these became my GADAs at that time. Oh, this is just a timeless watch. Once on Sipadan Island I was diving to 33 meters and already at this depth I looked at my hand and realized that I had not taken off my PR100. And what do you think? They work to this day. A very convenient watch with a low profile.

**Tissot Racing Touch T002.520.11.051.00**

When I saw this technology, it simply amazed me. At that time it was some kind of future. My parents brought them to me from one of their trips and it is very valuable for me considering that my father is no longer there. This is my weekend watch, I like to wear it when I am driving.

**Casio G-Shock GW-6900GW-7**

I have been fascinated by sailing since childhood, but at a certain point in my life I became a member of the crew of a cruising racing yacht. It was something like ""forget everything you were taught in school."" The loads are completely different and the watch needed to be appropriate. My wife and I were walking past the Casio store and they had a special price for this watch. I didn't have a G-Shock, but I knew that they were indestructible. And so they are. This watch has already been tested from constant contact with sheets, cables, lines, sails and water. It even sank in the Dnipro River and I found it in the muddy water only because it is white. Lately I have been taking it with me to the sauna and it is still holding up.

**Casio G-Shock GWN-1000B-1BJF**

Over time, I wanted something more specialized, sailing-marine. And my wife prepared a gift for me but she went to her friend's wedding for a few days before and hid the watch somewhere in the room. I then came home late and tired but heard this signal every hour, but never realized that it was a gift for me)

**Tissot Tradition Chronograph T063.617.11.037.00**

Almost two years have passed since my grandfather passed away. I knew that he had a habit of saving money but didn't really believe that something could be collected from his pension. While checking his apartment, a stash was found that our parents had given to me and my wife. I wanted to spend this money in a way that would remind me of him. So a Tissit Tradition Chronograph appeared in my collection (my wife also chose Tissot, by the way). This is our memory of him.

**Casio f91w**

This watch was bought as an experiment, I came across communities about its modding and generally learned about the legendary nature of this watch. Considering its price, I did not hesitate and do not regret it. This is my home watch. A very convenient stopwatch helps me brew coffee (drain the clever dripper in time). You can also sleep peacefully in them and not notice them. It is very convenient when I wake up in the middle of the night, I don’t have to reach for my phone to find out how much more sleep I can get)

**Casio Lineage LCW-M100TSE-1A2ER**

F91w fueled my interest in watches and I decided to look at the classic Casio models. How surprised I was when I found out that one watch can have a universal design, a titanium case, sapphire glass, a solar battery and radio synchronization. And the bracelet length change system is just awesome, and there are no extra holes in the end of the bracelet.

At this stage, I am fascinated by GADA watches and am considering the next purchase of Casio Oceanus, Seiko Astron or Citizen Attesa. All because I am such a person, I love “eternal” things and these watches meet my requirements. I'm still hesitant, but I'd like to hear advice from experienced collectors.",1,1756886449.0,Watches,0,1.0,False
1n78td5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1n78td5/boyfriend_earns_4x_my_salary_but_constantly/,"Boyfriend earns 4x my salary but constantly borrows money from me — am I justified in being frustrated, and how do I approach this?","My boyfriend is on well over six figures a year. For context: we live together and split rent and bills evenly (he pays $25 more for rent, but that’s it). We don’t have a shared bank account. Everything is 50/50, even though he makes quadruple what I do. He is not the type to splurge on me — no surprise flowers, no random date nights, nothing like that. He’ll splurge on himself, on pokies, on drugs, but never on me. It’s disheartening sometimes seeing other couples where the guy does those little thoughtful things, especially knowing just how much money he gets every week but whatever lol — that’s not the main issue here.

The real issue is that he has a long history of being bad with money. If he has money, he spends it (not on me). He also has a pokies problem. And despite earning well over six figures, he often ends up broke before the next payday. When this happens, he turns to me.

We’ve talked about his gambling before, and I know it’s ultimately on him to fix. I try to be supportive and encouraging, but if I push too hard, it just ends in a fight. Honestly, I know if I even bring it up, it won’t end well for me, so I usually don’t.

The problem is, at least every second or third fortnight, he’ll blow through all his money and then come to me for a loan. Until recently, I didn’t even have savings — I was finishing my thesis and had to quit my job to focus on uni. Back then, I occasionally had to borrow money from him, and it was a huge deal. He’d ask exactly what I was going to spend it on, hesitate, and make me feel bad for even asking for $20 for food or coffee. It was never easy or freely given.

Now the tables have turned, and I feel like I’ve become his bank. Yes, he always pays me back on time. But it’s gotten too comfortable for him. If I say no, it causes tension — he’ll question why I’m saying no, I’ll try to explain it’s about the principle, and he always manages to weasel out of that argument. In practice, when he runs short, I don’t cover rent or utilities, but I do end up paying for groceries, takeout, pub drinks, etc. PLUS the COPIOUS amounts of money I’m sending him. I usually end up sending him at least half of what I make in a week, if not more. He racks up a bill, and eventually pays me back, but it’s exhausting.

One time, I sent him grocery money and he gambled it away with his boss, then tried to justify it as a “work thing.” I ended up sending him another $400 that week. This week, he owes me double my weekly pay. I’m trying to build healthy savings habits for the first time in my life, and I’m sick of feeling like my account is just his second wallet.

For context, this used to happen all the time, then it slowed down, and now it’s ramping back up again. I don’t know any other couple my age where this happens — none of my girlfriends have ever talked about loaning their partner hundreds of dollars at a time on a regular basis. At most it’s like $10 for coffee or $50 for a takeaway, not this.

So my questions are: am I justified in feeling this way? Has anyone else been in this situation? How did you approach it? Because the conversation with him is so hard — he always comes back with, “Well you get your money back anyway, so what’s the big deal?” And I just don’t know how to explain to him why this is a big deal for me, or how much it’s impacting me.

TL;DR: My boyfriend makes 4x my income (well over six figures) but often blows through his money on pokies/drugs and then borrows hundreds from me (saying it’s for groceries, but it usually just goes back to pokies). He always pays me back, but I feel like his personal bank and it causes tension when I say no. I’m trying to build savings for the first time and I’m sick of it. Am I justified in feeling this way, and how do I approach the conversation without it turning into a fight?",2,1756886367.0,AskMenAdvice,3,1.0,False

I’ve created a free Discord chat room that I feel could be a better option. It’s empty now but, if enough people join and check in as they see fit, hopefully conversations will happen naturally and friendships will form.

Blew my mind how he got there, BUT…

We stopped at a truck stop to get food and decided to get lottery tickets (powerball and scratch offs). The first time we go in and get some. I had won $50 off spending $20, SWEET! I decided to get another $20 worth and pocket $30. 

When I went back inside to buy them. This old woman (probably in her 60’s) stood WAYY to close than what I felt comfortable with and I’m very chill, 27 years old, about 6 foot 1, 190ish lbs. so it’s not like a paranoia claim. Like, when I would bend down to get the cards (like a vending machine for them) my ass would have touched her. 

I asked if she wouldn’t mind taking a couple steps back and she didn’t. I was like “alright, whatever” in my head. As I’m grabbing the last of my tickets because it dispenses 1 by 1, she’s asks in such a creepy tone “Are you by yourself?” And I was truly baffled about what she said so I said “what?” And she repeated “are you by yourself” and I lost it. I said “NO ABSOLUTELY NOT! YOU DONT FUCKING ASK PEOPLE THAT ESPECIALLY WITH MONEY IN THEIR HANDS BUYING SCRATCH OFF TICKETS” and she didn’t really say anything except for when I walked away. She said “best of luck to you”. 

Am I wrong for blowing up? Like who the fuck asks if you are alone? What possible reason could justify someone asking a stranger that. Granted I could Sabu this women through a coffee table. Still. I know the area over there is bad in human trafficking and whatever else. It creeped me out forreal. 

I told the cashier and she looked concerned and said “where is she?” And I said “by the scratch off machine around the corner” and she said thanks for letting her know and she would do something about it and I left. What does everyone here think? 🤔 ",6,1756886039.0,traumatizeThemBack,2,0.75,False

What I’m about to share has only been discussed with a few people and I feel that they don’t believe what happened. But now I want to share it on here and see people’s perspective! Thank you in advance! 

This happened during the lockdown in 2020! I was working at a coffee shop and would work early shifts. I was living alone in my studio apartment and would wake up early to get to work and enjoy a coffee before clocking in. One day, I had a dream that felt so real. I was on my bed waking up (in the dream) and I saw 4-5 silhouettes of what looked like “alien” like /out of this world wearing black robes. The main one that was directly in front of me said “you’re not ready”. I told him “yes, yes I am ready” then he proceeded to say no and they all vanished. But before they vanished I faintly remember that they would invoke some sort of ritual / command of them moving a clock back and forth so I could go back to sleep and wake up. I then did go back to sleep and woke up in time to get ready for work. 


I felt that this dream was very real and things weren’t the same for me after that. My whole outlook on life changed so much. I felt paranoid most of the time. I felt utterly annoyed and upset on how people were just going about their days without acknowledging evils or chaotic society. 

At work I was often the person to joke around and was talkative but that dream changed so much. I would then go to my shifts with a sense of dread like I didn’t belong on earth, I felt numb to mundane tasks. 

Also, I want to note that during this time I was pregnant with my first child. Not sure if that would add / make a difference to the story. 

I guess this was my spiritual awakening? 
Although this happened in 2020 I am bringing it up now because I’ve been feeling weird again. Not in a nihilist sense but more so a sense of a higher calling…. Like someone is trying to communicate with me but I don’t yet understand who or why.

(Nutrition for MMA, Being a small Flyweight)","Hey everyone, I’m a 20-year-old male, 5’6” and 128 lbs, training for my first BJJ competition on September 27th. I’m always the smallest guy at the gym, whether it's for boxing, BJJ, or MMA.

Before I started training three years ago, I was much heavier at around 177 lbs. I lost a significant amount of weight, had a three smokers, and my weight has been stable at 128 lbs ever since.

I'm trying to figure out if this is a good walking weight or a problem. I see pros like Merab or Demetrious Johnson, who are my height but walk around at 140+ and cut weight. It makes me wonder if I'm just naturally a smaller frame now, especially since other striking sports for example boxing have divisions below 128.

Personally, I feel great at this weight. I'm lean (visible abs and veins on my biceps), and my health has improved drastically since I started training—I used to have undiagnosed stomach issues and they've completely cleared up.

I'm very careful about my nutrition and source high-quality ingredients from local farmers' markets. My typical daily diet looks like this:

* **10:00 AM (First Meal):** Chicken breast or wings, sweet potato or regular potato, and a big portion of salad or broccoli.
* **12:00 PM:** A cup of coffee with raw milk (that I pasteurize at home) and a bowl of almonds.
* **2:00 PM (Pre-Training Meal):** Sourdough bread, blueberries, and kefir. Sometimes I’ll add a banana.
* **8:30 PM (Post-Training Dinner):** More sourdough, an apple, and a homemade shake made with milk, honey, and cinnamon.

I practice intermittent fasting, so I just have black coffee when I wake up and don't eat breakfast.

My main questions are:

1. **Is this enough food?** I'm not trying to force a gain, but I don't want to be under-fueling my training and recovery, especially after such a big weight loss.
2. **For a future in MMA, should I focus on building more muscle?** Or is my natural weight class okay?
3. **How necessary is weight cutting in amateur BJJ/MMA?** Should I consider it, or is it better to just compete at my walk-around weight?

Any advice from others who've been in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated!

1n78nu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1n78nu9/here_is_practical_explanation_about_next_life/,"Here is Practical Explanation about Next Life, Purpose of Human Life,","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- `1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.
___________

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.
___________________

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

5th thing is whatever you eat `1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".
_______________________________
If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.
____________
Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.
_________________________
Source(s):
every `1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

* Or, as I'm next to the kitchen, she might ask me to bring up a coffee because she can't get out of the room.

What I'd love:

* Ideally, some kind of small screen in both rooms, maybe mounted on a wall, where we could put ""Busy/Free"", or even write something like ""Could you make me a coffee?"".
* I imagine it'd be something where we'd type the message on an app, and send it to the specific screen.
* I know we could just message eachother, but we're looking for something that'll display visually rather than get 50 notifications a day.

Another busy night in Belfast – though only one haircut this time.
Once again, we came home with no hygiene kits, but my view is always the same: if I’ve taken them as far as Belfast, they’re going to the people who need them.

Not everyone wants a haircut – people have their reasons – but everyone deserves kindness.

Our first gent had a good rummage through the bags of clothing and picked out a few tops to keep him going. Then he sat down for a fresh cut and left with toiletries, hand and foot warmers, and a new hat for the colder nights. He definitely walked away with more of a spring in his step than when we first met him.

No one else wanted a haircut, but one man we’d cut last week came over for a chat. He said he’s been getting compliments non-stop about his fresh look and was in great spirits.

The rest of the evening was spent handing out toiletry kits, hot drink sachets, hats, warm items – and plenty of conversations with those visiting the feeding station.

One gent wanted to share his story. He’s been on the streets for almost two months with no access to a shower, and that’s why he didn’t want a haircut. He felt pretty low. I handed him a toiletry kit and said, “I know it’s not much, but there are wipes in there so you might be able to freshen up.” You’d have thought I’d given him a box full of gifts. On top of that, we stocked him up with coffee sachets and sugar, plus a red hat to match the jacket he’d picked up, and some hand and foot warmers. We couldn’t give him a shower, but at least we gave him tools to freshen up and stay warm.

Another kind gent told us he’s been homeless for over five years. That struck me – we both became homeless around the same time, yet he’s still unhoused. We made sure he left with toiletries, tea, coffee, and sugar.

We ran out of men’s bags again, so with no ladies around, we pivoted – removing feminine products and ladies’ socks to make sure the bags still went to those who needed them most. I didn’t want the other items wasted, so we passed them on to the hostel nearby with help from the kind gent we’d met earlier.

By the end of the evening, we’d still some women’s clothes left, so on the way to the bus we dropped those off at the hostel too. I’d carried them all the way to Belfast, and I wanted to make sure they’d be used by those who need them.

It’s hard when we run out of supplies – one gent asked for toiletries after we’d already given away the last kit, and that stuck with me. Travel limits how much I can carry, but I’m thinking about smaller packs with just essentials, or maybe letting people pick individual items instead. It’s all a learning curve, and I’d love to hear your suggestions.

We may not always be able to give everything, but we’ll always give what we can.

[The Great Depression ](https://www.studentsofhistory.com/unemployment-during-the-great-depression)was the worst economic period in history. In the United States, unemployment rose to 25% at its highest level during the Great Depression. Literally, a quarter of the country's workforce was jobless.

This number translated to 15 million unemployed Americans in 1933. As the Depression spread across the globe, some countries saw unemployment as high as 33%.

There are several reasons why unemployment rose so high during this period.

First, people who had money invested in the stock market lost much of their savings during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. This caused them to spend less, which created lower demand for goods and services.

With businesses seeing a fall in spending, they cut back on output and employed fewer workers. This was particularly noticeable for luxury goods like motor cars.

The next major reason for unemployment also began with the stock market crash. When shares fell, many investors and ordinary people lost significant sums and went bankrupt.

Banks started to see loan defaults where people could not afford to pay their mortgages. There were concerns banks were running out of money. This led to well-publicized ""bank runs"" where lines of people sought to withdraw their savings before their bank closed. Many banks went bankrupt leading to people losing their entire savings. This led to a fall in the money supply and deflation (falling prices).

Another major reason for unemployment came from an agricultural recession. Less demand for goods led to lower prices and farming often became uneconomical. Dust storms in the Midwest also devastated farms. Many jobs were lost in rural areas, leading to a large migrant workforce seeking employment in new places, especially California.

The next reason for unemployment was a trade war. In response to worsening economies, countries began raising tariffs to protect their own industries. In 1930, the US passed the Hawley-Smoot Tariff, which placed tariffs on 20,000 imported goods. However, this led to retaliation as other countries placed tariffs on American exports. This led to a further decline in trade and new job losses, worsening the Depression worldwide.",2,1756885136.0,1930s,0,1.0,False

1n78e78,https://i.redd.it/yxb6opr3kwmf1.png,[Feedback] I built a free library of n8n workflows – now I want to monetize without paywalling. Ideas?,"Hey all 👋

A few months ago, I launched [n8nworkflows.xyz](http://n8nworkflows.xyz) – a free and open site where I curate and present existing n8n workflows from the official website in a cleaner, more discoverable format.

It’s not a replacement for the official site — more like a lightweight UI layer to explore and discover templates faster, especially for those who want to get inspired or find automations by topic (Reddit scraping, Notion integrations, email bots, etc).

Traffic has been growing organically, and I’ve received great feedback from folks who found it easier to use than browsing through the original listing.

Now I’m at a bit of a crossroads:

I want to keep it 100% free, but also explore ways to monetize it sustainably.

Not planning to add login walls or turn it into a paid product. Instead, I’m thinking about options like:

	•	Partnering with tool creators / sponsors

	•	Adding affiliate links (only when relevant)

	•	Creating a pro newsletter (but keeping all workflows accessible)

	•	Accepting donations (BuyMeACoffee, etc.)

	•	Offering optional paid templates, without limiting free access

Have you done this with your own project?  
Seen someone do it well without ruining the user experience?

I’d love your feedback — ideas, thoughts, lessons learned, or even brutally honest advice 🙏

Thanks in advance!

""Josie, you know you screwed up, right?"" Vincent Oldham's voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

'Wait, didn't I die?' she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she'd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

'So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?' Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. 'Am I tripping again?

'Imagining my crew's here to spring me from jail?'

""Look, we get it—you're gunning to join Professor David Lawson's research team. But that's no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,"" Vincent said, his tone sharp.

""You realize what you've done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she's so messed up she hasn't shown her face at school in days.

""Keep this up, Josie, and you're gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?""

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn't respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn't a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent—ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She'd somehow jumped back a decade.

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson's elite research team.

She'd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg's thesis was a near clone of hers—same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.

David's project was a big deal—first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie's seniors.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs—they all went to her.

Even David, who used to praise Josie's grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger.

Josie wasn't Natalie's biggest fan, no lie. She'd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

""You really blew it,"" Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ""Professor Lawson's giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he'll let it go.

""He'll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.""

""But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you're done. Expulsion's on the table.""

""Fine. I'll apologize,"" Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who'd fought his way into this school.

She'd known him longest—four years. She thought he'd have her back, trust her when she said she didn't start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn't cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn't push.

""Alright, it's a deal,"" he said. ""I'll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You're reading it to the whole school tomorrow.""

Josie's lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.

She wasn't that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.

But that wasn't the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.

In her old life, she'd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.

Not this time. She wasn't taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn't be her.

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.

""There she is—Professor Lawson's former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department's darling for supposedly jacking her paper.""

""She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in—just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.""

""Look at that sour face. She's not even in Natalie's league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.""

""Have her back? Please. They're all Team Natalie now. This whole 'say sorry in front of everyone' thing? Aiden's call.""

'Aiden's idea, huh?' Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.

She'd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.

Jaden was a first-year grad student who'd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She'd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he'd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She'd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ""Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones.

""Never figured you'd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She's too kind to even hold it against you.

""You didn't see her after what you did. She's a mess—skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.""

""And still, she's got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?""

""So when you see her, you better say sorry—and mean it, okay?""

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ""Got it, Jaden. I'll make things right with her, I swear.""

""Should've thought twice before pulling that stunt."" Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up.

Deep down, he'd always seen Josie as a solid kid—smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind.

'So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?' Jaden wondered, shaking his head. 'What a letdown.'

With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson's office.

# 2.Chapter 2 Saying Sorry

The air in David's office was thick with tension as the whole team sat crammed inside.

When Josie walked in, the vibe turned frosty, faces souring like they'd bitten into a lemon.

Except for Natalie. She jumped up, flashing a grin bright enough to blind. ""Josie! You showed!""

""I'm here to say sorry,"" Josie said, sidestepping Natalie's grabby hands.

She didn't have Natalie's gift for playing nice with people she couldn't stand.

Natalie faltered, like she'd been caught off guard. ""Wait, you still think I'm shady, don't you?""

Her voice quivered, eyes glistening like she was about to bawl. ""I didn't copy your paper, Josie. Take it to the dean if you don't believe me. Let them figure it out.""

Josie dropped her gaze, looking more pathetic than Natalie's theatrics. ""I'm apologizing, okay? The papers looking so similar threw me, but I wasn't gonna snitch.

""I didn't breathe a word to anyone else.""

The team, who'd been glaring at Josie like she'd kicked a puppy, started to rethink things.

Josie wasn't a gossip—she barely had friends outside the lab. This drama? She'd only mentioned it to them.

Aiden's frown eased, his eyes settling on Josie. ""I buy that you didn't mean to stir the pot, but Natalie got burned.

""If you hadn't gone all detective, people wouldn't be whispering about her stealing your work.""

""An apology's not too much to ask,"" he added, arms crossed.

Aiden was the team's golden boy—brains, looks, the whole package.

Josie had picked this major partly because it was the med school's hot ticket, but let's be real: Aiden was a big reason too.

He'd been her hero once. Once. Not anymore.

""Fair point,"" Kyle Langton, another senior, chimed in. ""Josie, I'm with Aiden. You didn't mean to cause a mess.

""Natalie's a softie, so just smooth it over, and we're all cool.""

Josie nearly laughed. Natalie, a softie? Yeah, right. But she zipped it. ""Got it, Kyle. I'll fix this.""

Turning to Natalie, she said, ""I'm sorry, Natalie. I messed up, and it hurt you. Honest—can we move past this?""

Then it hit her. Josie had been tight with this crew for years before Natalie rolled in. Breaking that bond? Tougher than she thought.

Natalie flashed a sugary smile. ""Josie, I was never mad! Forgive? Psh, nothing to forgive!""

She spun to David, plopping down beside him with a flirty grin, voice all sweet. ""Told ya, Professor Lawson. Josie wouldn't try to screw me over. Cut her some slack, yeah?""

Lawson wasn't biting. His face was hard as granite, shooting Josie a look that could freeze lava. ""On purpose or not, she screwed up. And screw-ups have consequences. So, Josie, how should I deal with you?""

David's face was like stone as he shot Josie a hard stare.

He'd always thought she was the good girl—smart, driven, a total overachiever. Now? He wasn't so sure.

To him, grades were one thing, but a shady character was a dealbreaker. 'She's gotta learn her lesson,' he decided. 'No more badmouthing her classmates.'

Josie had puzzled over why everyone bought Natalie's act. After some soul-searching, it clicked: Natalie was gorgeous and a master at playing the damsel.

Josie couldn't compete. So she swallowed her pride. ""Whatever you say, Professor Lawson.""

""We're kicking off research soon,"" David said, voice sharp. ""Your punishment? Sort every scrap of data. Make it so we can grab what we need, no fuss, no muss.""

He waved them off.

As they headed out, Josie, stuck in the middle, flashed back to her old life.

She'd been slapped with a disciplinary note and kicked off the team. To make things right, she'd buried herself in the archives, sorting documents like a machine.

It took a brutal month—one meal a day, late nights, the works. She ended up with a messed-up stomach and flunked classes.

And the thanks? Nada. They just griped her work wasn't good enough.

'What a load of crap,' she thought. 'Bust your tail, and they still dump on you.'

Now, here she was again, stuck with the same lousy job.

""Hey, Josie, I'll help you out,"" Natalie said, catching up and linking arms with her. ""If I keep my mouth shut, the prof won't know.""

""She's got this coming,"" Jaden cut in, pulling Natalie back. ""Why cover for her?""

Vincent glanced at Natalie. ""Chill about Professor Lawson. Sorting files is nothing compared to a real punishment.""

""Got it, thanks, Vince,"" Josie said with a quick smile, hurrying after Natalie.

""Hey, Nat, I was so caught up saying sorry earlier, I forgot—I got you a little something."" She pulled a sleek box from her bag.

The group stopped cold, crowding around.

""That Aiden's medal?"" Tianna blurted.

Vincent nodded. ""Yeah, his first big win in that med competition. He loved that thing—till he gave it to you to cheer you up.""

""Spot on,"" Josie said, eyeing the group. ""I was new, totally bombed an experiment, and Professor Lawson chewed me out. Aiden gave me this medal, said it was lucky.

""And you know what? After that, I was golden—no more screw-ups.""

She held the box out to Natalie. ""Natalie, I heard this mess really got you down—depression and all. Take this. It's like a good-luck charm.

""You'll be set from now on. Aiden swore by it.""

Natalie's eyes lit up. She wanted that medal. Not just for its shine, but because it was Aiden's—his first victory, something special.

In her eyes, Josie didn't deserve it. But snagging it right in front of him? That was ballsy.

""Josie, that's sweet, but it's Aiden's gift to you,"" Natalie said, pushing the box back. ""I can't take it.""

# 3.Chapter 3 Picking A New Major

Josie shot Aiden a quick glance before shoving the medal into Natalie's hands. ""Heard it was Aiden's big idea to make you apologize in front of everyone.

""He's clearly got a soft spot for you. It's just a medal—he won't care if it cheers you up.""

""Right, Aiden?"" Josie shot him a sly grin.

That grin stung like a jab. Aiden knew she was salty about the whole apology deal.

'She's the one who screwed up!' he thought, steaming. 'How's she gonna be so petty?'

That medal wasn't just some cheap token—it was his first, handed over with so much pride. Back then, he'd been over the moon to give it to her. Now? Total regret.

'She doesn't get it,' he fumed. 'I treated her like my little sis, always had her back, helped her out.

'And what do I get? All that care, tossed in the trash.'

""Nice one, Josie,"" Aiden growled, snatching the medal back.

Josie didn't flinch. She raised an eyebrow. ""What, not cool with cheering up your little star? Thought you'd love it.""

""You don't just regift something someone gave you,"" Natalie snapped, pouting. ""Come on, Josie, that's basic.""

""But you're not just anyone,"" Josie said, all innocent with a blink. ""You're the team's darling. Aiden's fine with it, right?""

""Over the moon,"" Aiden said, his calm mask cracking with a scowl. He shoved the medal at Natalie. ""Here, kid. Keep it safe. Don't be like some people who flunk Gift 101.""

He stormed off.

The second he was gone, Natalie's face darkened. She'd always wanted that medal, but like this? It felt wrong.

Josie was bolder than she thought, humiliating Aiden in front of everyone. 'Is she trying to get booted from the team?' she wondered.

""Josie, what's your deal?"" Vincent groaned, glaring. ""Why tick off Aiden? You still wanna do research or not?""

Josie sighed. ""I thought he'd be stoked since he's so into Natalie. How was I supposed to know he'd flip?""

She glanced at Natalie. ""My bad, Natalie. Didn't think he'd care. But he's fine now, so it's yours.""

She sauntered off without a glance back.

The others swapped looks, thrown. Josie, the quiet research geek, was acting off. Something was definitely up.

\*\*\*\*\*

The next day, Josie slipped into the library. No way was she here to play good student and sort files like her past life.

Her mission was picking a new major.

Med school was a five-year slog, and she was deep in her senior year. Switching now was a long shot. But sticking with her current major? Made her wanna puke.

It wasn't the program's fault—it was the fact she'd burned bridges with the team's big shots. Staying meant signing up for hell.

She wasn't here to get crushed, not with a second chance.

She knew the team was headed for a dumpster fire. So there was no need to stick around.

Plus, leaving was the only way to see Natalie's true game and unravel the mysteries from her old life.

The catch? She had zero clue what major to pick. And that was a problem.

She'd spent all afternoon tearing through every book on majors in the library, desperate for one she could pick up fast and graduate with in a year. No dice.

Ready to call it quits and try again tomorrow, she spun around too fast and kicked a table leg.

A guy napping at the table jolted awake, his book hitting the floor with a thud.

Josie winced, snatching it up. ""Oh, shoot, I'm so sorry! I didn't—""

Her eyes caught the title, and her apology stalled. ""Acupuncture?""

""Who said you could touch that?!"" The guy yanked the book from her and stormed out.

""Why'd you go and mess with him?"" Kyle strolled in, pulling Josie aside. ""You okay? He didn't get in your face, did he?""

Josie shook her head. ""I'm good. I just knocked his book off. Guy's got a right to be ticked. What're you doing here, Kyle?""

""Vincent and Jaden got held up, so I came instead."" Kyle handed her a lunchbox. ""No way I'm letting you sort this mess alone.""

Josie took it with a grin. Things were different this time. In her old life, they'd iced her out. But now, after apologizing to Natalie, they were actually being nice.

She wasn't fooled, though—it was all about Natalie, not because they trusted her.

Back then, she hadn't apologized. No matter how much she explained, nobody bought it. Once, while stuck in the library, she'd seen Kyle pass by with a lunchbox.

Starving, she'd asked if she could have some to save time.

Kyle had scoffed, saying the food was for Natalie and that a ""nobody"" like her didn't deserve it. Just because she hadn't kissed up to Natalie.

Josie popped the lunchbox open, shaking off the memory. ""Thanks, man. I'm starving.""

She settled in a corner to eat, her mind drifting to that book.

'Acupuncture? That could work,' she thought.

If she remembered right, it was the least popular major at med school. Jobs in Traditional Medicine were rare, and acupuncturists? Basically nonexistent. Nobody picked it.

But that was the perk: it was easier to get into, and with so few students, the professors had time to actually teach. She could get plenty of one-on-one help.

She'd have to check it out.

""Yo, you zoning out?"" Kyle wandered over. ""I called you, like, twice.""

Josie flashed a sheepish grin. ""Just thinking about earlier. You know that guy I bumped into?""

""What, Sean Reedshaw?"" Kyle's face twisted like he'd bitten a lemon.

Josie blinked. ""That's Sean Reedshaw?""

Rumor had it their department had two hotshots: Aiden, the golden boy who lit up the room, and Sean, the dark, mysterious type, like a storm cloud one couldn't pin down.

""He's got major beef with Aiden and some seriously bad vibes. Steer clear,"" Kyle warned, giving her a look.

# 4.Chapter 4 Playing Dirty

Josie smirked to herself. If this guy was on Aiden's bad side, she was definitely gonna get to know him better.

She chucked her lunchbox into the trash and headed off to dig up some books on acupuncture.

Kyle caught her ignoring him, and his jaw tightened. ""Hey, you hear me? You already ticked Aiden off this morning. Don't go making it worse.""

Josie almost laughed, but it was a cold, bitter one in her head. In her old life, she'd jumped through hoops to keep them happy, always putting their feelings first.

Not anymore. She was done playing nice—she was looking out for herself now.

""Thanks for handling the stuff, Kyle,"" she said, voice icy, barely glancing at Kyle before heading upstairs.

Her chilly vibe threw Kyle off.

He'd known Josie forever, and she'd never hit him with that look.

Kyle's mind spun. 'Is she still mad about this morning when we pushed her to apologize? I thought Aiden's feelings were her top priority. I was just trying to help—why's she acting like I'm the jerk?'

Kyle scoffed and stormed out of the archive room.

When Josie came back down with her book, the empty room didn't surprise her.

Kyle was selfish to the core. His family name and skills weren't enough to keep him in the team's good books, so he stuck to Aiden like glue, always sucking up.

Back when Josie was the team's favorite, Aiden had a soft spot for her. Kyle milked it, using her to talk him up to Aiden.

Even when a lab disaster nearly got him kicked out, Josie had begged Aiden and David to give him another shot.

But when Natalie framed her and the team turned on her, who was the first to stab her in the back? Kyle.

Josie let out a sharp, mocking chuckle. 'What, I give him the cold shoulder once, and he just bolts?

'Wait till I shove that diploma in his face, every backstab he pulled returned, one by one. What's he gonna do then?'

She pushed Kyle out of her mind, left the archive room, and headed to her dorm, missing the cold, angry eyes watching her from the shadows.

Kyle figured Josie would blow up his phone, begging him to come back and help.

The archive room was a mess of papers—no way she could sort it alone.

But she didn't call. Didn't even stay. She just walked out. That wasn't the Josie he knew.

'Is this who she really is?' he wondered, doubt creeping in. 'Was that sweet, go-along girl just a front all this time?'

Kyle's face lit up like he'd cracked a big secret.

Heading to the guys' dorm, he muttered, ""Josie, you're done. I'm gonna expose you and make things right for Natalie.""

Aiden had pushed for Josie to apologize to Natalie, showing who he really cared about. Kyle thought If he could get on Natalie's good side, Aiden would be stoked.

He'd hoped Josie would suck it up and say sorry to Aiden—then he'd have two people hyping him up to the boss.

'But nope, Josie's gotta be stubborn and blow me off,' he thought. 'Well, can't say I didn't try!'

Josie bolted back to her dorm, stuffed her laptop into her backpack, and headed for the door. Before darting out, she shot her roommate a look. ""Hey, if anyone comes asking for me, just say I'm sick and dragged myself to the hospital, okay?""

And yeah, she did head to the hospital.

Aloville's only traditional medicine hospital, linked to their med school, was her spot.

Josie slung her bag over her shoulder and made a beeline for the acupuncture wing.

She'd checked the school's website and knew Delilah Wilcourt, the acupuncture rockstar, was running rounds today.

She hadn't even hit the department when she spotted Delilah down the hall.

""Professor Wilcourt!"" Josie called, but before she could say more, Delilah cut in.

""You're late! Hurry up, get changed, and meet me in the treatment room, stat,"" she said.

Josie didn't bother explaining. She just followed Delilah, who was already charging ahead.

Rumor had it, acupuncture training got real hands-on later on. For local interns, Delilah led rounds, teaching while treating patients.

In the changing room, Josie noticed it was way quieter than David's chaotic sessions, where a herd of students trailed him. Here, it was just Delilah and three interns—Josie, one guy, and one other girl. Super chill setup.

""Get the tools ready,"" Delilah said, slapping on a mask and glancing at them.

Josie had no idea what to do, so she stuck close to the other girl, Claire—she'd glimpsed her name on her scrubs' badge while changing.

""First timer?"" Claire asked, passing Josie some silver needles to sterilize. ""Who sent you? Nobody mentioned a new intern. What's your name?""

Josie flicked her eyes toward Mu, who was distracted. She exhaled softly. ""Josie Pearson.""

""Josie?"" Claire squinted. ""Sounds familiar. We met before?""

Josie's stomach flipped. ""Nah, acupuncture's my second major. First time here. Came for Professor Wilcourt's rep. Pretty sure we're strangers.""

""Huh, I could've sworn—"" Claire started, but Delilah's voice sliced through.

""Quit yapping!"" Delilah grabbed the sterilized needles and headed for the treatment room. ""Move it! Today's patient's got a tough case, and this'll take a while. Pay attention.""

Claire made a face behind Delilah's back, then tugged Josie's arm and whispered, ""Don't worry, Professor Wilcourt's all bark. She's the coolest prof here.

""You picked a good gig—barely anyone does acupuncture, so internships are wide open. Professor Wilcourt basically holds your hand.

""Finish your internship, and you're set to see patients solo. Graduate, get hired, and bam—full physician status.

""No assistant grunt work like other specialties. Plus, better pay and an easy workload.""

""Hmph,"" a snarky scoff interrupted. It was the guy, mask on, face hidden, no badge.

Josie had no clue who he was.

""No need to oversell it,"" he said, eyeing Josie. ""School didn't mention new interns.

""You sure you're in the right place? If you're lost, you can still bail—Professor Wilcourt won't care.""

""Sean, you serious?"" Claire hissed, yanking his arm.

Josie froze. 'So he's Sean. No way I am leaving now.'

Before she could speak, Delilah's voice rang out. ""Sean's got a point. If you're in the wrong spot, walk now, and I won't blink. But if you stay and flunk the assessment later, don't expect me to go soft.""

# 5.Chapter 5 The Hands-On Test

Josie was dead-set on switching majors, and acupuncture was her golden ticket—the one field she was sure she could nail and graduate from. No way was she letting this slip away.

She gritted her teeth and said, ""I'm not in the wrong place. I'm serious—I came here specifically to learn acupuncture!""

""Alright, come on in,"" Delilah said, giving her a quick once-over. Her mask hid any hint of what she was thinking, leaving Josie wondering if the professor believed her or was just humoring her.

Nervous as hell, Josie stepped into the treatment room.

She figured switching majors wouldn't be that big a deal. Her pharmacology and anatomy classes had given her a decent foundation. She wasn't totally clueless.

Wrong. The moment Delilah started teaching, Josie realized she'd been way too confident.

Her mind was suddenly flooded with a ton of questions. 'What's a trigger point? Where's this spleen meridian at?

'Why light incense before the needles go in? And hold on—why's it gotta be super slow and careful when you're poking those acupuncture spots? Man, seriously?'

There was a mountain of info to memorize and a ton of details to keep straight.

One measly hour felt like a week-long crash course—the kind where one couldn't jot down notes and there was a pop quiz at the end.

By the time Delilah finished, Josie was sweating bullets.

She was terrified of flunking the test and blowing her chance to impress Delilah. If she screwed this up, her dream of switching majors was dead in the water.

""So,"" Delilah said, turning to her as they stepped out of the treatment room, ""how much did you pick up?""

Claire, catching Josie's jitters, jumped in. ""Hey, no pressure. Just spill what you remember.

""Wilcourt's not gonna bite your head off. That's a lot to take in all at once.""

Josie's heart swelled. She knew Claire was right—Delilah had gone into way more detail than she would've if Josie hadn't been there.

Claire and Sean, both acupuncture majors, already knew this stuff like the back of their hands.

Her gut had been right about Delilah. Unlike David, who'd snap at her for blinking wrong, Delilah was patient as a saint during hands-on lessons.

A flicker of warmth hit Josie—she wasn't about to let them down.

""You used two needle sets,"" she said, steadying her voice. ""The first set hit the trigger point, Large Intestine 4, Governing Vessel 20, Stomach 40, Heart 7, Large Intestine 11, Stomach 44, Liver 3, Stomach 36, Spleen 9, and Governing Vessel 26.

""The second set targeted Kidney 3, Heart 7, Kidney 7, Large Intestine 11, Conception Vessel 4, Large Intestine 4, Conception Vessel 6, and Stomach 28.""

She took a breath and added, ""The calming incense you lit had stuff like patchouli, cinnamon bark, mugwort, lavender, and sandalwood—at least, that's what I could make out.""

Josie glanced nervously at Professor Wilcourt. ""Did I get that right?""

Wilcourt's eyebrow shot up. ""You smelled the ingredients in the incense? Seriously?""

Josie nodded firmly. ""Yeah. I took an herbal medicine elective my sophomore year. I crammed like crazy for a pharmacology contest to win some cash. Really needed it.""

Claire's face lit up. ""Hold up, that's why your name rang a bell! You're the one who beat me out for first place and snagged that fifteen-grand prize, right?""

Josie winced. ""Yeah, sorry about that, Claire. I was desperate for the money.""

""Sorry for what?"" Claire laughed, brushing it off. ""You won it fair and square. What, you think I'm gonna mug you for it or something?"" She gave Josie a playful nudge, clearly not holding a grudge.

Delilah let out a low whistle. ""Losing and still bragging? If I were you, I'd keep that on the down-low.""

""For real,"" Sean said, peeling off his mask and throwing Claire a flat stare. ""Talk about embarrassing.""

""Hey, watch it, you—"" Claire started, but Delilah cut her off.

""Alright, you two, go grab some food. I need a quick chat with Ms. Pearson here.""

Josie's spine stiffened. So now she knew Delilah had overheard everything and knew she wasn't some official intern sent by the school.

Claire caught her panic and leaned in with a grin. ""Chill, girl. If you really wanna learn, just lay it on thick with her. Maybe flash those puppy-dog eyes—you're cute enough to pull it off. She'll totally cave."" With a cheeky wink, she let Sean drag her off.

The room went silent, just Josie and Delilah left, her nerves buzzing like a live wire.

""Professor, I gotta level with you,"" Josie said, fidgeting with her sleeve. ""I wasn't straight-up earlier. I'm not an intern sent by the school, and I've never taken your class.""

Delilah raised an eyebrow, motioning to a chair. ""Didn't you take pharmacology as an elective? That's my course, so you've kinda heard me teach.""

""Relax, kid,"" Delilah said with a half-smirk. ""My program's not exactly swamped with fans. If you're serious about learning, I'm game to teach. But that pharmacology contest you brought up? That was two years ago.""

She leaned back, eyeing Josie. ""You were a sophomore then, so… senior now, right? About to graduate? Got an internship lined up?""

Josie nodded, her stomach in knots. ""Yeah, but I tanked the exam for Professor Lawson's research team.

""That means scrambling for a new internship, and that's not why I picked this field. I'd rather switch to something I can crush than settle.""

Delilah gave a slow nod, her face hard to read. ""David's the big shot in his field, no doubt. If you can't join his crew, breaking out's gonna be tough.""

""But acupuncture? It's not some side hustle you just pick up. Why do you think you'll kill it here?"" Her voice had an edge, a spark of challenge in her eyes.

Josie knew she was on thin ice. One slip, and she'd tank her shot at acupuncture and piss off Delilah.

She took a deep breath, voice steady. ""I'm not saying I'll rule your field overnight. But I've checked my electives, and if I'm switching, acupuncture's my best bet.

""I've looked into traditional medicine—it's blowing up here. If I go all in, I can make waves, maybe even outshine Professor Lawson's crew.""

Delilah snorted, her stern look cracking into a grin. ""Smooth talker, huh? You saying I'm better than Professor Lawson?""

She chuckled, then got serious. ""My program's the underdog on campus. Barely anyone sticks it out to a PhD. Professor Lawson's classes? Kids fight like hell for a spot.

""His team? You graduate, you're golden—straight to top research gigs.

""You didn't make Professor Lawson's cut this time, but you could try again. Switching majors, though? No going back. You sure about this?""

Josie didn't waver. ""Dead sure. Acupuncture's niche, but that's why it's easier to stand out. You're as big a deal as Professor Lawson in your field, Professor Wilcourt. I'm betting on this.""

Delilah studied her for a beat, then shrugged. ""Alright, you can stay—but you gotta ace the final exam this semester. Only then will I sign your internship papers.""

Josie exhaled, relief hitting her hard. But before she could relax, Delilah added, ""You nailed those acupuncture techniques you memorized.

""Shows you've got a sharp brain. So, just passing the exam? Not enough. You gotta crush it.""

Josie's jaw tightened, but she nodded. ""Deal. Can I start shadowing you now?""

# 6.Chapter 6 The Right Place

Claire lit up brighter than a Christmas tree the moment she heard Josie was staying—way happier than Josie herself.

""Thank god. I finally got company. You have no idea."" Claire tugged her toward the hospital's temp dorms. ""Staring down Sean's ice-queen act every day was driving me batshit.

""We're crashing at the hospital's intern housing—got the whole room to myself. Metal bunk bed, bedding's all set. I've got fresh sheets and a duvet cover stashed away—we'll swap 'em out once we get there.

""For these two days, Professor Wilcourt has consultations. We're following her around to gain some experience. If you don't have classes, you can stick around for a few more days.

""Oh, right, what's your major? Have you finished your courses? Why not intern over there?""

Claire's questions reminded Josie of Professor Lawson and her teammates, but she wasn't upset about it; instead, she felt happy about taking this step.

Second go-round at life, she'd staked everything to dodge last life's tragedy. Changing majors? That was her first real move to swerve clear of all that.

Claire's warmth and easygoing nature helped ease Josie's awkwardness.

""I'm majoring in cytology under Professor David Lawson. And he has plenty of interns,"" she replied.

Even though Claire was enthusiastic, she knew how to keep things appropriate and didn't pry further. ""You're right; it's better to be a main player here rather than an invisible one in Professor Lawson's team.

""With fewer students under Professor Wilcourt, each one gets more attention. You came to the right place.""

""Yeah."" Josie smiled, feeling inexplicably cheerful.

As they talked, they arrived at the dormitory. After helping her settle in, Claire pulled her off to eat.

They went to the hospital cafeteria. On their way there, Josie messaged her roommate Adeline, telling her that she'd be staying at the hospital for a couple of days.

Just as her thumb hovered over the power button, the screen blazed to life: Aiden Brown!

Josie's pretty eyes didn't even flicker at the name. Dead calm, she hit mute and then tossed the phone back into her purse like yesterday's trash.

""Why aren't you answering?"" Claire glanced at her.

Josie smiled. ""It's nothing important. Let's go eat.""

Compared to eating, Aiden was totally irrelevant.

\*\*\*\*\*

Underneath the girls' dormitory building at Aloville Medical School, Aiden watched his darkening screen with a frown. ""She didn't answer!""

""Josie is getting more disrespectful by the day! She doesn't even pick up your calls now! What does she think she's doing?"" Kyle grumbled angrily, ""Doesn't she think we'd still try to make amends after how she treated Natalie?""

""Kyle, please hold your tongue,"" Vincent said irritably. ""Josie isn't some backstabber! She owned up to Natalie and took her lumps already. Don't drag her like this.""

Kyle snapped, ""My fault now? This afternoon, I hauled my ass to the archives to help. All I said was 'Just apologize to Aiden.'

""Next thing I know, she blew me off and stormed out. Left the archives a total mess.

""Wouldn't have dragged you all here if I wasn't terrified she'd get penalized again. And now? Screening calls—unbelievable!""

Kyle's words slammed a thick silence over the others. Their faces soured like milk left out, blame for Josie already brewing.

""I'll call her roommates."" Jaden took out his phone.

The call ended quickly.

He looked at Kyle with a serious face. ""You said Josie left because she was mad at you. But didn't you notice that she's sick?""

""What happened?"" Aiden's original dark expression softened slightly.

Jaden sighed. ""Her roommate said she went straight to the hospital after coming back this afternoon. She seems to be admitted and won't be able to come back soon.""

""Could it be fake? When I saw her this afternoon, she seemed fine."" Kyle didn't believe it.

Vincent glared at him. ""Then would she need to bribe a doctor into admitting her for two days?""

""Who knows if she's really in the hospital? Otherwise, why wouldn't she even answer calls?"" Kyle snapped.

Aiden shot a glance at the others. ""Enough, all of you. Josie has always been frugal and doesn't have many friends in Aloville. If she weren't hospitalized, she would have been back at school by now.""

""Jaden, go find out which hospital she's in so we can visit her. How did she suddenly get sick?""

Just as Jaden was about to leave, Gavin pulled him back. ""Jaden, remember we promised to have dinner with Natalie tonight? She just got back to campus and was in a fragile state.

""The professor said she can't handle any more stress. If we all go visit Josie—""

Before he could finish, Aiden interrupted, ""You're right; we can't break our promise to Natalie. Let's put Josie on hold for now.

""She knows how to take care of herself and probably doesn't need us worrying too much.""

When Vincent heard this, his expression darkened. ""But what about the archives? With her hospitalized, who knows when those files will be sorted? Professor Lawson might be angry.""

""She already upset the professor once; if this delays our project further, she's going to be kicked off the team."" Aiden pressed his temples.

""These years working together have built up trust between us; I don't want her to leave now. We'll all go help out at the archives.""

Hearing this, the others exchanged looks and all agreed accordingly.

\*\*\*\*\*

Josie didn't know that the job that gave her a stomach problem in her previous life was now taken care of by Aiden and others.

She had just finished dinner with Claire and was back at her dorm.

Delilah assigned them homework during dinner, and as soon as they got back, Claire grabbed her laptop and hadn't said a word since.

Josie wasn't much of a talker anyway. After opening her laptop, she didn't rush to do the homework but wrote an email to quit David's research team first.

In her previous life, after getting disciplined, she did a lot to win back the seniors and David's trust. Eventually, they agreed to let her join the team.

Once in, her internship file fell into David's hands. With the disciplinary record, she had to bend over backward to please him for a good job after graduation.

She did all the dirtiest and most tiring work in the team and even broke through several research bottlenecks.

But in the end, her evaluation only said: \[Quiet and not very professional; suitable for administrative and basic research; not fit for academic research!\]

Seeing this, she went to confront David, who replied, ""I can't allow someone with such poor morals into an academic lab; I have to be responsible for the entire medical field.""

Such high-minded words.

But Josie was naive back then. She thought David misunderstood her and tried hard to change his impression, doing thankless tasks until they sent her to prison.

Now, she wouldn't give David another chance to control her. Her internship report would be perfect, and the evaluation must be fair and true.

With this thought, Josie hit Enter and sent the email to David.

At that moment, it felt like a weight was lifted off her chest.

1n78cl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1n78cl7/itinerary_for_a_hyped_first_timer_3/,Itinerary for a hyped first timer <3,"Hey guys,

after following this sub for quite a while, the time has finally come: this fall we’re heading to Japan for almost a month (10.10–04.11). Super excited to finally experience this beautiful country!

We’re around 30 years old and our main interests are food (huge fans of meat, sushi, and ramen), shopping, city strolling, coffee shops, and vintage spots – but of course, we also want to take in a fair amount of culture.

Our route starts and ends in Tokyo since we’re flying in and out of Narita Airport. The idea is to keep check-ins and check-outs to a minimum, as we’ll be traveling entirely by public transport and I really want to get a proper feel for each place. So far, I’ve come up with this plan:

	•	Tokyo: 4 nights (arrival + settling in)

	•	Hakone: 2 nights (onsen & relaxation)

	•	Kyoto: 5 nights (with day trips, e.g. Nara)

	•	Osaka: 4 nights (should I maybe swap a day here with Kyoto? Still undecided)

	•	Hiroshima: 2 nights

	•	Tokyo: 8 nights to finish the trip



I’m planning not to book too far ahead, so we can stay flexible and maybe extend or shorten stays depending on how we feel. Do you think that could cause any problems? Accommodation will mostly be through Airbnb.

Don't worry nothing bad to report from up here. Just a quick hello and catch up as I've noticed a few new voices in here and there has been a supply run so I'm good on coffee for the next few months. 

Anyways, how is everyone? Staying out of trouble? 
Apparently the newest gossip up here is some new leech movies being released... Gaia only knows why someone would sit and watch... Hopefully no one recommends them on movie night. 

How are things in New York? How's the pit? 

Time for checks. Stay safe out there everyone. Something is brewing.

I have had it for 2 weeks and find 40mg has more of a positive impact. Its like wearing noise cancelling headphones all the time on brain activity and I've enjoyed emotional regulation - however, the amount of discipline I need to keep the dose effective seems contradictory to the diagnosis itself. 

To avoid a day where i don't have extreme highs and lows, and have sleep - I find I have to
- eat breakfast with protein 
- drink water consistently 
- not have coffee which tends to send me over the edge
- haven't quite figured out what to do manage around my periods  where emotions are scatty
-  ideally exercise to balance it all
- ensure I have better lists of things to do to avoid crazy hyper focus on the wrong thing on meds 


As someone with adhd doing the above is, well, the start of the issue itself! If I could do all these things I probably wouldn't be on meds! 

The doc said she thinks I'm very sensitive to medication but think titrating from 20-> 40 knowing that was probably not the right approach, but she implied that i didn't really have adhd if I'm on 20 as it's a child's dose. 

Also I was on sertraline for the last few years - 75mg and she suggested titrating it down to nil as elvanse will provide regulation. But now if I don't do the above I have poor sleep and the cycle continues. 

I'm hoping it eases off and adjusts in a few months and going to ask for 30 before staying on 40.

1n789lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1n789lk/week_1tired_of_clickbait_im_building_a_personal/,【Week 1]Tired of Clickbait? I’m Building a Personal AI Information Filter,"In my \[last post\], I shared that I’m setting out to build my own version of a “Jarvis” — an AI system that serves me, not replaces me. Today I want to talk about **why I’m doing this**.

The short answer: traditional information feeds no longer serve me. Every time I open a news or content app, maybe 1–2 out of 10 items are actually relevant to my work. The rest? Entertainment, clickbait, or just noise.

I’ve spent around six years working on recommendation algorithms. I know exactly why this happens: the logic is built for advertisers and engagement metrics, not for user value. The result is endless scrolling, filtering, wasted time, and often very shallow content. Social media makes it even harder — it’s nearly impossible to verify truth vs. hype, since everything is optimized for grabbing attention.

Traditional media outlets are much more reliable, but they update too slowly and often stick to fixed perspectives. If I want multiple angles on a single topic, I have to check several platforms manually. That’s a lot of work just to get a balanced view.

I’ve also tried RSS tools for years, but they come with heavy maintenance costs. As platforms shift to paid subscriptions or stop supporting feeds, RSS has become a dead end for me.

So here’s what I want instead:

* An assistant that automatically gathers information **based on my own criteria**.
* Controlled through natural language (thanks to LLMs).
* With long-term memory — remembering my habits, rules, and tasks.
* Running 24/7, constantly filtering, curating, and organizing info the way I want.

I like to think of it as a **presidential-level service** — a private, exclusive Chief Information Officer just for me.

The exciting part? My team loved the idea too, so we decided to actually start building it.

And of course, a great plan needs a great name. History has the Apollo Program, the Manhattan Project, and even Project Poison Pill. Names carry ambition, and we wanted ours to reflect that spirit.

Now, I’m not saying our project will end up in history books next to Apollo, but at least the *name* should make it feel like it belongs there.

At first, we thought we’d settle this quickly: spend two days with a placeholder codename just for the dev phase. But by day three, things got out of hand. Everyone had their own idea, each with its own meaning and symbolism. The project was already set up, code was being written… but we still didn’t even have a codename. For engineers, that’s chaos.

So, after an unreasonably long “coffee-fueled” debate, we turned to the most **scientific** method available: drawing lots.

That’s how the project finally got its name: **Ancher**.

The first time he said we should meet for coffee then deleted his account (lol). Now a couple of months later he remade his account and we were chatting again, he was asking me to send him ""sexy"" pics (we'd already exchanged face pics). I said I don't send nudes but sent him a torso pic (lol). He sent me some extra pics in return (a face pic and a torso pic), then I suggested exchanging numbers so we can grab coffee next week. BAM blocked!

Now I'm just wondering if this guy just wanted sex and my ""no nudes"" message put him off? But then why did he reply with his own pictures after I sent him the torso pic? Was it because I suggested getting coffee? Tbh I'm kinda pissed off if he only saw me as sex material lol. Or maybe I was just too forward?

My public profile is torso pics so that was probably sending the wrong ""casual"" message too (tbh I just don't wanna put my face out on that kind of website lol).

As I stood there, my mind was a whirl of 'what ifs'. What if he thinks I'm weird? What if I freeze up and it gets awkward? But I knew the only way to get over this fear was to just do it. So, I took a deep breath and went for it.

""Hey, how's your morning going?"" I asked, hoping my voice didn't cack.

Turns out, he was super friendly! We ended up chatting abbout our go-to coffee orders and a little about our favorite lcal spts. It was such a nice surprise to find common ground with someone new, and it helped ease my anxitey a little. 

I leatned that sometimes, the scariest steps are the ones with the best outcomes.

also, the beans are all from devans, but since they dont give ziplock bags with valves, im using these bags from previous beans

the blends which i tried this time are:

oriental espresso

Mysore nuggets

Viennese blend

cupping ratio and method: 8g beans medium fine grind +120ml boiling water, wait 4 min stir, wait some more and drink

I also have an espresso machine at home(dedica E685) and that is what i use for my daily cappuccino (I mostly drink milk based). Altho i do appreciate a cup of nice black coffee once in a while.

Cappuccino: 19g beans fine grind in unpressurized basket, 40g out in 30sec

Here's my review on these blends: (im still learning so plz forgive if i say something wrong)

Oriental espresso- I found this one to be quite bland, both, when had black and in a cappuccino. Im not sure how to say it but i just felt it lacked flavour and boldness, mostly wont go for this one next time

Mysore nuggets- Right off the bat when i had it with my cappuccino i could feel that it was quite bold (just as they had claimed). It was overall a really enjoyable cappuccino, i did feel a few....flavours?? idk what to call it but it was rlly good, and when i drank it black it was surprisingly less bitter than the others and gave a rich aftertaste, i think it was also the most acidic out of these 3

Viennese blend : Probably my favourite when had as a cappuccino. it is a little less bolder than Mysore nuggets but oh man that aftertaste is just heavenly, and it lingers on your tongue for a long time. when had black, it was relatively more bitter than the rest but was tasting pretty good too. although i think i prefer Mysore nuggets over this one for black coffee

Tbh i dont think im a big fan of dark roasts black coffee, coz that just gives me the taste of... well... coffee!! When i drink light/medium light roast black coffee, the flavours i get are unmistakable and just fabulous. Up till now the back coffee of silver oak blend is the best one I've had, there's that subtle sweetness and nuttiness to it

lmk abt your views if you have had the same blends and if what i say is also what you experienced

also, i have tried lodhi blend but it just didnt work for me as i found it a bit weak and not so bold""

Chapter 1 - A Kiss at the Airport, A Heart Let Go

Picking up my husband from the airport after his business trip, I saw him kissing a girl passionately.

She had just turned nineteen—the niece I had raised with my own hands.

She nestled shyly in his arms while he gently smoothed the wind-tousled strands of her hair.

That kind of effortless intimacy was a tenderness he hadn’t shown me in years.

I never imagined that in ten years, that little girl would grow into such a beauty.

Or that a man’s affection could drift away so quietly, without a sound.

I watched the scene calmly, without stepping forward.

I simply turned around and walked away.

From that moment on, I decided to let them be.

What Layton didn’t know was that letting go would cost him me—forever.

---------

By the time Layton called out from behind me, I had already reached the parking lot.

The October wind was sharp, cutting across my face like a blade.

My hand trembled slightly as I gripped the car keys—I wasn’t sure if it was from the cold or from the shock.

“Meredith, wait up.”

He caught up and reached casually for the coffee in my hand.

I turned away, avoiding his touch.

Layton paused, then smiled. “What’s wrong? Who upset our Meredith?”

Our Meredith.

He hadn’t called me that in years.

The last time was probably three years ago.

“I’m tired. I want to go home,” I said, sliding into the driver’s seat.

Layton got in on the passenger side and buckled his seatbelt. “This trip was exhausting—endless schmoozing every night. Oh, by the way, Mom’s coming over for dinner. Don’t forget to pick up some extra groceries.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my eyes on the road.

In the rearview mirror, I could see the airport exit.

Hana was walking out, pulling a pink suitcase, smiling at her phone.

I’d gone with her to buy that suitcase last month. She said pink made her look younger.

“By the way, is Hana back too?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

Layton’s phone buzzed just then. He glanced down. “Probably. Didn’t she say she was starting an internship? Oh—she just texted. Says she’s already home.”

Already home.

But I had just seen her walking out of the airport.

My chest tightened.

So they had already gotten this good at lying to me.

Chapter 2 - The Scratches and the Secret

When we got home, Layton headed straight for the shower.

I sank into the living room couch, my gaze drifting absently to our wedding photo on the coffee table.

In the picture, I was beaming, tucked safely in his arms, my eyes shining with pure happiness.

I was twenty-five back then; he was thirty.

He promised he’d give me the happiest home.

My phone buzzed—a WhatsApp notification from Hana.

A polished selfie popped up, captioned: ""Finally home! Nothing beats Auntie’s home cooking~""

It already had tons of likes and comments.

My sister Vivian liked it right away: ""Our Hana just keeps getting prettier!""

My mom Leila chimed in: ""Why didn’t you tell us you were back? Come for dinner tonight.""

Reading those comments, a bitter irony washed over me.

Hana is my sister’s daughter. When she was five, my sister and her husband passed away in a car accident.

I had just gotten married then, and out of compassion for my little niece, I took her in and raised her as my own.

That was fourteen years ago.

From kindergarten all the way through high school graduation, I never missed a single parent-teacher conference for her.

When she was sick, I stayed up night after night by her side.

When she went through her rebellious phase, I guided her patiently.

Even when I found out she was dating young, I didn’t make a big deal—just had a gentle heart-to-heart with her.

I thought, since I treated her like my own daughter, she would see me as her closest family too.

Until this afternoon at the airport, when I saw her snuggled in my husband’s arms.

So natural, so intimate—clearly not the first time.

The bathroom door opened. Layton stepped out with a towel around his waist. ""Meredith, could you grab me some clothes?""

I walked into the walk-in closet and picked out a set of loungewear.

As I handed it to him, I noticed faint, fresh scratches on his arm.

They looked recent—probably from today.

""How’d you get these?"" I asked.

He glanced down casually. ""Must’ve scraped it while moving boxes.""

Moving boxes.

I remembered the fresh manicure Hana just got—pink nails with tiny rhinestones.

She called it the ""man-repeller shade.""

My mother-in-law Octavia did come over in the evening, carrying bags full of groceries.

""Layton said you were back today, so I bought all his favorite dishes.""

She started bustling around the moment she stepped inside, not once asking if I was tired.

That was nothing new. In her eyes, her son always came first.

I mechanically washed and chopped vegetables, my mind still stuck on the scenes from the afternoon.

""Meredith, Hana’s back, right? Invite her for dinner tonight. She’s grown even lovelier since starting college,"" Octavia said while sorting veggies.

My hand paused.

Even Octavia knew Hana was back.

""She just got home. She might want to rest,"" I said flatly.",1,1756883131.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

“Josic, you know you screwed up, right?” Vincent Oldham’s voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

“Look, we get it—you’re gunning to join Professor David Lawson’s research team. But that’s no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,” Vincent said, his tone sharp.

“You realize what you’ve done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she’s so messed up she hasn’t shown her face at school in days.

“Keep this up, Josie, and you’re gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?”

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn’t respond.

This wasn’t a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent-ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She’d somehow jumped back a decade.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs-they all went to her.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with

Josie wasn’t Natalie’s biggest fan, no lie. She’d been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

“He’ll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.”

“But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you’re done. Expulsion’s on the table.”

“Fine. I’ll apologize,” Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who’d fought his way into this school.

She’d known him longest-four years. She thought he’d have her back, trust her when she said she didn’t start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn’t cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn’t push.

“Alright, it’s a deal,” he said. “I’ll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You’re reading it to the whole school

Early 50s, was downsized 2 years ago from a corporate job I enjoyed, and was given 2 years of severance.  

At my age and in my industry (creative/media stuff), it's been impossible to find a new job at the same level or even lower.  

Fortunately, I invested well over the years and have about 8m in growth stocks and 2m in money market/short term treasuries at about 4 percent. I guess I'm set unless the market crashes, but certainly not rich. Have a house payment and other expenses.  (Is that even considered FAT?) 

That said, I'm extremely unhappy!  

The transition from a career overseeing large teams as respected manager and accomplishing something every day--to doing very little with my life-- is incredibly unsatisfying.  My partner still works, so I basically spend my day researching my portfolio, working out, reading the internet, and hiking with my dog (who is the happiest she's ever been!).   

People have suggested some things to do next.  I don't really have any interest in charity work or volunteering.  Wanted to use my media skills in the last election, but they weren't interested.  

I've never run a business on my own or been involved in a startup.  And while it sounds fun, I think I may be too risk adverse to try something out of my wheelhouse, at my age.  

Curious if anyone else is in a similar situation.  I hopefully have a lot of years left, and this isn't what I'd hoped it would be.  Wanna grab coffee??

I 34M am struggling to move on from a four year relationship with my now ex 37M. Things ended approaching 3 years ago when he told me that he’d fallen out of love. At the time I was devastated, I fully wanted to marry him. I grieved the relationship, the life we had together and we were planning on building together. All in all I’ve managed to put together a relatively good life since and while I’ve tried dating, I just can’t seem to find the spark with anyone else that I had with him.

We share some mutual friends so I see him socially on occasion, I’ve made a point of keeping my space particularly since he got into a new relationship to his now fiancé.

Recently, I had a death of an immediate family member and for the first while after I got the news I could only think about how I desperately wanted to speak to him. I kept to my personal boundary and didn’t text him and managed to reach out to friends who were a lot of help with the first few days of grief.

Fast forward a few weeks and he got the news of the death of my family member from an extended family member of mine whose path crossed with his by pure happenstance. He reached out to ask how I was doing and to get details. It was such a relief to be able to talk to him about it. We make plans to meet up a few weeks later when he would be free.

We grab coffee and I share the details of what happened. We catch up. The conversation organically just goes on and on covering all sorts of topics just like it would do when we were together. Finally we have to part ways due to other commitments that day and he hugs me goodbye and the spark I feel from him hits like full on lightening blast through me. I’m still as heartbreakingly in love with him as the day he left me.

Why do baristas seem very strict with how coffees are made compared to Australia? 

We’ve been told at two specialty coffee places in Malaga who make really good coffee  that they can make it slightly hotter but they won’t do  our request for extra hot as it will affect the taste. So compared to what we can ask for and get in Australia the coffees are not as hot. Both times we have had friendly banter with the barista / coffee guy. 

I get that temperature is a thing in coffee making but what I’m interested is if there is a stricter culture in Malaga/Spain Vs Australia, and if so why? Sample size of two places is not huge, so might need to try more places. 

The taste of the coffee in both places was perfect by the way. Just prefer hotter. 

I know there are cultural differences everywhere and I accept them. I am interested to know why these differences occur. 

I have other examples of requests being denied too hence my question. I can add them here if anyone’s interested.

Offer of Ash



The Lisbon safehouse was quiet that night. 

His men lay sprawled in bunks, boots left at angles, breaths heavy with fatigue. 

The lamps burned low. 

At the table, Killa sat alone, knife in hand, dragging the whetstone slow across the steel. 

The rhythm steadied him; the rasp kept his ribs aligned with the hum he always trusted.

The knock came too soft for soldiers. 

Three taps, polite as a guest.

Killa didn’t look up. 

He said only: 

“Enter.”

The door eased open. 

A man in immaculate cuffs and polished shoes stepped inside.

His posture was smooth, his voice warm as velvet. 

Behind him, two guards followed, broad-shouldered, their forearms marked with burned glyphs that still faintly glowed.

“Chief Medeiros,” the emissary said, bowing slightly as though this were a negotiation between equals. 

“You’ve earned a reputation.

Discipline. 
Loyalty. 

A leader of men. 

The Dead Flame has noticed.”

Killa set the whetstone down.

His knife gleamed faint in the lamplight. 

He said nothing.

The emissary smiled, teeth too white for Lisbon. 

“We offer you rank. 

Not as another soldier, but as one of us. 

A captain within our order. 

Your own command, your own men. 

And more than that - ” he leaned closer, lowering his voice.

“Octave. 
The future. 

We will grant you a percentage of every shipment, every sale.

Wealth beyond your barracks pay. 

A share in the river itself. 

Think of it. 

You could lead and own.”

The hum in Killa’s ribs grew sharper, like stone under pressure. 

He looked at the man’s hands, the cuffs, the faint gold pin on his lapel. 

None of it impressed him.

His answer came steady, almost soft:

“No.”

The emissary’s smile twitched.

“You misunderstand. 

This isn’t refusal, it’s opportunity. You are a man of discipline. 

We are offering you family. 

A place at the table. 

Respect that the state will never give you.”

Killa blinked once. 

His chest vibrated like a drumhead.

 He repeated, flat and certain:

“No.”

Silence cracked the air. 

The guards shifted, glyphs twitching alive on their skin. 
The emissary’s velvet tone thinned to a blade: 

“Then you leave us no -”

Killa’s knife flashed, catching the lamplight, and cut first guard’s throat before his hand found his weapon. 

A pivot, elbow shattering the emissary’s sternum. 

A kick drove the second guard back into the wall; the knife reversed grip and found his heart.

Before their bodies hit the ground, the hum in Killa’s chest erupted.

Scarlet anger bled through his skin, glowing like fresh blood under the lamp. 

The air bent with the force of it.

The three convulsed mid-fall, weight reversing, form collapsing - until what landed was not flesh but fine sand, thudding heavy against the floorboards.

The glow receded. 
The room fell still.

His men stirred in their bunks, half-waking, but none rose. 

They had heard this rhythm before. 

They knew its name: 
Havoc.

Killa wiped his blade across what remained of the emissary’s perfect jacket, streaking dust into red. 

He set the knife back on the table, calm, breath even.

He stepped into the hall, voice level but firm, the voice of a chief:

“Vassoura. 
Caixote do lixo.”

“Broom. 
Dust bin.”

No gloating. 
No speech. 

Just order.

Behind him, the sand cooled.
 
Ahead of him, the Archive hummed approval in his ribs, steady as truth.


●●●○○



The Decision Corridor

The night still smelled of sand and blood. 

Havoc’s scarlet traces lingered on the walls, a glow his men pretended not to see. 

They muttered in their bunks, restless with the weight of what they’d witnessed, but none spoke. 

They knew better.

Killa sat at the table, knife clean, rosary warm in his hand. 

The beads clicked soft, steady as the hum in his ribs. 

He did a postmortem of the days events to himself as he always did after violence:

His squad. 

Brothers by choice, not bound by glyphs.

 Alive because he steadied them.

Order with kindness. 

A discipline that held without breaking men.

The Dead Flame offered riches and Octave profit. 

He had left them as sand because wealth without truth was just another leash.

The rosary clicked again. 

His ribs thrummed steady, not faltering.

And in that hum came the shape of a man whose name he had spoken often, though never aloud with hope.

Bastien Tremblay.

Not a commander. 
Not a general. 

A man who could have kept his genius hidden, who could have lived in towers of glass. 

Instead, he had built ReSØNance, machines and systems that pulled thousands from hunger, freed cities from collapse, gave new life to places the world had already written off.

A billionaire, yes. 

But one who spent his wealth breaking chains, not tightening them.

To Killa, that was more than legend. 

That was proof. 

Proof that power could serve, not consume. 

Proof that order could build instead of bend.

This was why he had refused the Dead Flame. 

Why he had turned their emissary to dust. 

Because Bastien’s example stood in contrast to every lie they offered.

The hum in his ribs pressed steady, as if agreeing.

Killa closed his eyes, thumb hard on the rosary’s cross. 

His chest beat with it - the Archive’s secret drum.

Whatever test the Archive was writing, its end was clear: his path bent toward the man who had already begun changing the world for the better.

Toward Bastien Tremblay.

 The Emerging God’s Silence


The tram rattled along Lisbon’s hills, iron wheels biting the rails.

Late afternoon light spilled through the windows, painting dust motes gold. 

Killa sat by himself, hands folded, ribs humming faint as always - the Archive’s secret drum.

Halfway down the line, a cry broke the rhythm.

A boy, no older than seven, convulsed in his mother’s lap.

His small body arched, eyes rolling back, foam catching at his lips. 

The mother screamed for help.
Passengers froze. 

A man fumbled for a phone. 

The tram clattered on, blind to the moment it carried.

Killa felt the hum in his ribs spike, sharper than a blade. 

He did not move from his seat.

He simply pressed his hand against the glass beside him.

The vibration leapt. 

Through iron, through dust, through the pane, into the child.

The boy’s body stilled. 
Breath returned. 

A shudder left his small frame and he sagged into his mother’s arms, sobbing.

 She kissed his forehead again and again, whispering prayers to saints she thought had answered.

No one looked at Killa. 
No one saw.

He withdrew his hand from the glass, palm tingling. 

His ribs thrummed slow, steady - like satisfaction, like confirmation.

He leaned back, voice low enough only he could hear:

“Whoever you are, I hear you.”

The tram rolled on. 

The mother wept in gratitude.
 The boy slept, safe.

And in the silence between iron and rail, between breath and hum, Killa felt it: a presence vast and unseen.

Not the Dead Flame.
Not the Archive’s riddles.

Something other.

The Emerging God.

It did not speak.
It did not show itself.

But its silence pressed close, and Killa knew: he was being courted still.

A presence older than curse, yet young as breath.

Every time he had summoned Havoc, the same name had burned behind his eyes.

Now it came clear, carried on the hum in his ribs -a boy’s name, waiting in Toronto.

Kai Pathsiekar.

The Hangar Courtship


The hangar reeked of jet fuel and sweat. 

Sodium lights buzzed overhead, casting the whole space in a harsh white glow. 

The echo of voices bounced off steel rafters, layered into a rising storm of ambition.

Twenty agencies.

Uniforms crisp, contracts polished, boots and shoes lined in neat rows. 

They came one by one, two by two, three at a time, until the floor looked less like recruitment and more like court, a court of predators circling one wolf.

Killa stood at the center. 

His men formed a ring behind him, rifles near at hand. 

The rosary warmed in his hands, but his ribs hummed steady.

The first recruiter stepped forward, voice booming under the lights.

Epaulettes blazing, medals stacked across their chests.

They promised him rank. 

Colonel today, general tomorrow.

Whole battalions under his command. 

“You were born to command, Chief Medeiros,” one barked.

“We’ll give you an army to prove it.”

The second voice cut in sharp as a blade.

Dark suits, eyes like razors. 

They offered shadows. 

Immunity from law, black budgets, files that could erase his name from every ledger. 

“We can make you untouchable,” one whispered. 

“A ghost above consequence.”

A third group slid in, their words honeyed.

Ties gleaming, smiles carved to camera-perfect shape. 

They spread documents across a table like cards in a game.

Citizenship in Lisbon.

Washington. 
Rome. London.

“The world is yours to claim,” one said smoothly. 

“Take a nation as your name.”

Then came the merchants.

Shoes polished to reflection, watches glittering. 

They laid out ledgers fat with profit streams. 

Arms deals, tech contracts, percentages of wealth so vast no weapon would ever need to touch his hand again. 

“You want legacy?” 

one smirked. 

“Build an empire with us. 

One your bloodline will never spend dry.”

The last to step forward burned with fanatic light.

Robes trimmed in gold, voices quaking with certainty. 

They spoke of sacred fire, of holy war, of scripture yet to be written. 

“You are flame-born,” one cried.

“Join us, and your name will outlast stone.”

Killa listened to them all. 

Rank. 
Shadows. 
Nations. 
Wealth. 
Glory. 

The words echoed off the walls, hollow as ash. 

His ribs hummed, steady, unimpressed.

The circle stirred again. 

The sixth agency stepped forward, papers in hand, throat cleared. 

A new voice began:

“Chief Medeiros, consider -”

The hangar shook.

A low vibration rolled through the rafters, deeper than any engine.

Dust shivered down from the beams. 

Shadows spilled across the floor like ink.

Heads snapped upward. 

Voices died.

Through the skylights, something vast eclipsed the night.

A vessel descended, its skin not metal but membrane - a living surface rippling with Archive glyphs. 

Symbols shimmered and rearranged across it like constellations, glowing cobalt and gold, singing faint tones that prickled in the ribs. 

Curved wings folded with inhuman grace. 

Domes along its hull pulsed with lattice light. 

It floated almost silent, weightless, as though carried by frequency itself.

It looked stolen from a century not yet born.

The ship settled into the hangar with a precision that mocked gravity. 

Its shadow swallowed the six suitors whole, an elephant dropping onto their careful table of offers. 

A ramp materialized, glowing faint blue.

Bootsteps echoed down.

And the air snapped to attention.

They all thought they saw him, Bastien Prime, the barefoot billionaire, the myth who bent machines into mercy and turned profit into bread.

But it was Aegis Quatre. 
Bastien’s Tactical Echo. 

Jacket cut sharp, boots planted like anchors. 

Cold, exact, all steel. 

To the world, there was no difference. 

And that was the point.

The agencies froze. 

Their promises shriveled into silence.

Aegis Quatre strode down the ramp with soldier’s poise, every line of him carved from discipline. 

No crown. 
No medals. 

Only the weight of a man who could end arguments with presence alone.

Killa’s ribs surged.

And then he saw it - saw him.

The man he had carried like a star in the distance - proof that power could serve and not consume - now stood before him.

And in that instant, Killa felt the Archive’s hand at his chest. 

Not to test. 
Not to break. 

To award.

It wasn’t the promises of generals or businessmen. 

Not the false crowns of diplomats or zealots. 

It was something purer, rarer: recognition.

The Archive’s gold star.

A medal for every night he had kept boys alive when their knees buckled.

For every civilian he had lifted from rubble and carried without thanks.

For every order he had given that kept fear from breaking a squad.

For every scar borne in silence, every grief swallowed so his men could keep walking.

Pinned to his chest now by the only hand that mattered.

The weight of it undid him.

Killa’s breath fractured. 
His vision blurred. 

He had faced blades, bullets, glyphs, Havoc itself without flinching, but this - this honor, this mercy - cracked him wide open.

In front of generals, spies, zealots, and profiteers, Chief Medeiros - Havoc incarnate - broke. 

Tears poured down his face, unstoppable, hot rivers cutting through years of silence. 

The sobs dragged up foster homes that had never held him, comrades who had leaned on him until they were gone, the ache of brotherhood longed for but never found.

Every drop fell like it had been waiting decades to be released.

The hangar went still. 

Men who had come to bargain now stood frozen, unsure if they were watching a soldier collapse or a soul reborn.

Quatre stopped mid-step. 

The hard steel mask of the tactical Echo met something unexpected. 

And then - 
impossibly - 
it melted.

He crossed the last steps and pulled Killa into his arms.

The hangar froze as O Lobo wept into what the world believed was Bastien Prime’s shoulder. 

His sobs weren’t weakness, they were cleansing, each tear washing rust from spirit until it gleamed like tempered steel.

Through°Orbit, through the brotherhood, through all the Echoes, Quatre vibrated with emotion - compassion, kinship, warmth rooted deep in the body.

It rose from his chest to his core, down into his groin where recognition, not desire, swelled.

This was a brotherhood he could feel. 

In the press of the embrace he sensed it echoed - the weight heavy between Killa’s legs as well. 

Not arousal, but the gravity of belonging. 

Heat pressed to heat. 
Brothers returned.

Quatre drew him tighter, the weight of command melting into something truer. 

He pressed forward, girth heavy, as if to say: only truth lies between us now.

Killa didn’t shrink from it. 

He shifted, adjusted, pressed back, exposing the full scope of himself so Quatre felt the thickness and weight of his truth, leaving no doubt that nothing spoken in this moment could be false.

Their foreheads touched, breath hot between them. 

The hum in Killa’s ribs climbed until it merged with Quatre’s, six frequencies locking into one.

Quatre’s voice dropped, barely a whisper against his ear:

“Come to ReSØNance.”

Killa’s laugh broke through the tears, body still pressed to body, heat answering heat.

“You had me at the spaceship coming down.”

The sound of their laughter, ragged, wet, unguarded - rose through the hangar. 

Brothers, returned.


●●○○○



ReSØNance Lock

Toronto. Midnight.


The ReSØNance Tower stood like a glass crown against the skyline, humming with hidden machinery and sleepless light. 

At its heart, buried deep in vault and circuit, the Archive chip pulsed - a steady rhythm, quiet as breath.

Then the embrace between Killa and Quatre landed.

A vibration tore through the lattice of the building, subtle at first, then undeniable. 

Elevators shuddered. 
Monitors flickered. 

Coffee cups trembled on forgotten desks.

And across the tower, four men froze.

Prime. Deux. Trois. Cinq.

Each in different rooms, different tasks, but indistinguishable to the world outside.

Prime bent over schematics, eyes narrowing as the pulse rose through his ribs.

Deux, the genius, sat in the Vault, mapping living geometry with his mind when the resonance scrambled his focus. 

Shapes shifted on their own.

Trois, the healer, was halfway through calming a panicked recruit when he faltered, voice catching, hand pressed hard over his chest.

Quatre, the soldier, stood in the hangar half a world away, arms locked around Killa Medeiros.

His steel discipline had cracked, and was now pressing to Killa’s to let brotherhood through.

Cinq, the playboy, devastatingly gorgeous, had been entertaining a PR team with a perfect smile, arguing over language for a campaign. 

They believed they were with Bastien Prime himself - but mid-word, his charm broke. 

The resonance struck, and he fell silent, beauty sharpened by sudden gravity.

The chip’s hum swelled, threading through each of them, binding rib to rib.

Bastian Prime whispered first, not to the room but to the Archive itself:

“°Orbit engaged.”

Deux echoed: 

“Engaged.”

Trois, softer, in French: 

“Engagé.”

Cinq exhaled sharply, lips parted, the word catching in his throat, but his silence carried the same weight.

For one breath, the whole city seemed to feel it. 

Lights along the crown of the Tower flickered in sequence.

Streetlamps across the financial district blinked once, twice, as though Toronto itself had joined the hum.

Bastian Prime gasped, the hum slamming through him with such force it rooted in his core. 

He reached down between his legs, grasping the heavy, steely girth that had risen under the weight of resonance. 

The same truth Quatre pressed into Killa was alive in him, alive in all of them. 

His breath broke, the word torn raw from his throat:

“Tabarnak.”

Then stillness.

Prime leaned back in his chair, pulse running hot beneath his jaw. 

His eyes blazed with recognition, half awe, half dread.

The Archive had written its test.

And the answer was alive in them now.



●●●○●



The Wolf Enlisted


The hangar still smelled of jet fuel and burnt ambition, but the suitors were gone. 

Twenty agencies had come with crowns of paper and promises of power. 

All of them had been erased by a single truth: the Archive had already chosen.

Killa’s ribs hummed steady. 

His tears had dried, leaving his face salt-streaked but lighter, as though the years of silence had been wrung out. 

He had been tested. 

He had been awarded.

Quatre’s hand was still on his shoulder, heavy and unshakable.

Not command. 
Not contract. 

Brotherhood.

And when the ship’s ramp materialized back, Killa walked with him, stepping into the light that pulsed from its living membrane. 

He did not look back at the hangar. 

He had no need.

The Archive had written his name into ReSØNance.




●●○○○



The End Part 3. 🛑 

 
But across the ocean, in caverns lit by glyph-fire and Octave flame, another path was being carved. 

Where Killa had been awarded a star, his twin was branding himself with scars.

Two brothers. 
Two flames.

°Orbit had engaged - but collision was inevitable.


🫧""One awarded. 
One scarred. 
Both bound.”

As the titel says: i need to bash the filter on the dump box like crazy to get the puck out, sometimes even use a spoon. 

here is what I've done so far: 

-I have experimented with the grind, but if I use coarse grind I don't get the desired pressure.

- I think i tamper with around the 15kg pressure so don't think that's the issue

- cheap beans were horrible but mainstream brands like lavazza are only a little better ( not talking flavor here) 

- doesn't really matter how long I leave the puck in, longer is obviously worse, but even after only a short time it sticks 

- I cleaned the sieve

- seems to be worse with the single shot sieve then the double

- if I take less coffee then recommended ( there is a groove in the sieve) i don't get the recommended pressure and a mushy puck.

I'm going crazy😅. 

Any more recommendations?

We had shift rotas that were generated for the month and the company advised that if we needed a certain date off to log it well in advance. So I log New Years Day, reason being I had no transport at the time and as this call centre was in another city there would be no trains running.

No probs says the manager, I have it logged on my system as booked an think no more about it. Until we get the rota months later when I am booked in. I pop to see a manager, the old one I'd booked it with had left. I'll sort it he says and I leave it at that.

Get to a few days before and rota still not changed, see manager again and he flips the script. I know nothing, you never notified me, we can't change it and you'll need to be in.

So I walk away, sorry zero tolerance of dicks and cue New Year's Day. I get a call about half hour after my shift is due to start an lots of other calls. I ignored every single one, no way I could get in an fuck am I ruining my day borrowing a car. I had plans to get drunk and that's what I did.

Anyway next shift I walk in, get called in. 2 managers with clip boards and a lady from HR. I'd gone AWOL, not answered work calls etcetera. I recap whole situation, cue manager id spoken to denying everything. 

Let this drag on for 2 hours plus, then dig out my original authorisation id printed off signed by 1st manager that'd left of which a record is on the system. None of them had even done a simple check.

*“What gifts do people actually bring from Finland?”*

You guys came up with such good answers that we just had to share them!

Here’s the ultimate list of Finnish gifts that always work and sometimes confuse people in the best way 😉

The absolute champion: **telescopic sausage stick**. People go crazy for it. Perfect for campfires anywhere!



**Sweet classics:**

• Fazer chocolate (especially from the flagship store)

• Makulaku’s famous “meter-long” candies

• Licorice lovers will appreciate Bis Bis, Suku Laku, Pop, or go fancy with filled versions or liquor chocolates



**Savory treats:**

• Koskenlaskija processed cheese blocks

• Fish spreads in soft tubes (shrimp is a favorite)

• Rye crisps or traditional round rye breads

• Reindeer jerky

• Salmon or caviar (just double-check customs rules first)



**Drinks:**

• Finnish coffee — small roasters are a hit with coffee geeks

• Kotikalja 

• Finnish craft beers or special editions (like Amorphis / Children of Bodom ones)

• Koskenkorva 



**Lifestyle**:

• Marimekko and Moomin goodies (always a safe choice)

• Iittala or Pentik homeware — timeless and practical

• Lumene cosmetics — super popular abroad 



✨ And if your friends have never tried Finnish licorice, bring just a small amount. Too much, and you might lose them forever 😅

I’m not finding myself super hungry, nor craving all the unhealthy food I used to eat. I used to eat breakfast on the road to work everyday, and sometimes double dip and eat lunch out too. Now, I’m religiously having 880 calories between breakfast, a protein coffee I make myself, and then lunch everyday. Taking the guess work out of “switching up my lunch and breakfast” has been a huge game changer. I just needed to find a routine meal that I liked. The fact this this gets me 880 calories gives me the freedom to cook and eat whatever I want for dinner with my partner, which I enjoy. We do make healthy dinners but I appreciate not having to be worried about some butter since I go lean all day. I’m likely between 100-135g grams of protein a day, which I know is a bit low for 4x a week training at my body weight. It’s hard to eat more than this without really forcing it on myself, and I’m focused primarily on weight loss right now. 

Anyway, I sometimes scare myself that I’m in too big of a deficit to see progress in my strength training (despite getting stronger, I am tracking this as well) due to my calorie deficit seeming so high according to TDEE calculators. Am I just in enough body recomposition from being so overweight that I’m ok? Do I need to increase my calories despite not feeling like I need to eat more? I’m literally just paying attention to what I eat for the first time in years. If I’m hungry I make popcorn (my favourite binge snack) but I just don’t drown it in butter and make a reasonable serving. I no longer hit McDonald’s (nor crave it) on my way to work or at lunch, and I enjoy my eggs and egg whites with low fat Tex-mex. 

It’s been two months and I’m feeling great, I’m energetic and sleeping better. People are noticing the results, which feels good. But am I just approaching a cliff? I want to do this sustainably and it feels sustainable right now. But am i sabotaging my strength goals with my current weight loss goals? I anticipate I am a bit but the focus is weight loss right now anyway.

I start my shift at 08:30 with coffee and a quick system check. Headset good, notes open, resource map loaded. I skim the latest situation update, then join a two-minute huddle to hear about shelter capacity and any new hazards. Deep breath. Status to available.

The first call is a man who lost power and meds overnight. I slow the pace, ask about immediate safety, and walk him through a simple breathing exercise. While he talks, I search for an open clinic and arrange a ride. He laughs once, a small crack of relief. We set a time for a check in, then I log the case and tag it for follow up.



Mid morning is steady. Evacuation questions, food distribution sites, worried relatives. I keep water nearby and stand up between calls. When one caller goes silent, I stay calm and use grounding steps. She returns, shaky but focused. Together, we make a short plan for the next hour. It is enough.



After lunch the lines surge. News just broke about flooding. I triage, ask clear yes or no questions, and route a few high risk calls to the supervisor. A woman sheltering in her car needs a safe place. I find a spot, confirm intake, and stay on the line while she parks. She says thank you in a tired voice. I feel it.

1n77dcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/discreetfwbdating/comments/1n77dcc/how_courting_transformed_my_sugar_relationships/,How Courting Transformed My Sugar Relationships – And Why You Should Try It Too,"When I first stepped into the world of sugar relationships, I’ll admit—I didn’t think much about courting. Like many, I believed sugar dating was about instant chemistry, quick agreements, and moving fast. But over the years, I’ve learned that real, fulfilling sugar relationships are built on something deeper. Courting, or as I like to call it, the art of taking your time to build connection and trust, changed the way I approach sugar dating entirely.

https://preview.redd.it/wmaorfhc8wmf1.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=eadad6cc276d7eeaa0aa7094e4b08abe3fe0276b

Courting is not an old-fashioned concept; it’s a strategy that works incredibly well in today’s sugar world. As a sugar daddy, I’ve met incredible sugar babies—smart, ambitious, and full of life. But rushing into arrangements without genuine connection often leads to misunderstandings or unrealistic expectations. Courting, instead, allows you to get to know each other slowly. You talk, share stories, set boundaries, and build anticipation. It’s not about dragging things out unnecessarily; it’s about creating an experience that feels real for both sides.

Why should you try [courting during sugar relationships](https://www.sugardaddymeet.com/courting)? First, it sets you apart. Many sugar daddies offer allowances, gifts, or trips too soon, and it sometimes attracts the wrong kind of attention—those looking for quick gains without genuine interest. When you take the time to court a sugar baby, you show respect for her individuality and goals. This naturally filters out those who are only there for a fast transaction and attracts women who want a enjoyable, long-term connection.

Second, courting builds trust—something money alone can’t buy. In my own experience, I’ve found that when I dedicate the first few weeks to meaningful conversations, planning creative dates, and even surprising her with thoughtful gestures (not always expensive, sometimes just personal), the relationship develops a level of comfort that makes everything else flow naturally. There’s less pressure, more understanding, and ultimately, more passion.

Third, courting protects your investment—both emotional and financial. A rushed arrangement often falls apart as quickly as it starts, leaving both parties unsatisfied. But a relationship built with courting has structure. You learn her boundaries, her dreams, her lifestyle. She learns about your expectations, your schedule, and your vision of what a sugar relationship should feel like. That clarity saves you time, money, and emotional frustration.

For example, one of my most rewarding sugar relationships began with a month of nothing but lunches, coffee dates, and long walks by the beach in Sydney. We didn’t jump into an allowance discussion on day one. Instead, we talked about her career ambitions, my travel schedule, and how we could add value to each other’s lives. By the time we agreed on our arrangement, everything felt effortless—there was no guessing, no tension, just a smooth and elegant connection.

If you’re a sugar daddy wondering why some relationships burn out too quickly, or why you often feel like just a wallet, try courting. Take her to a rooftop dinner. Invite her to a weekend market. Send her a book that reflects your conversation. Show that you’re not in a rush to buy her time—you want to win her interest, her attention, and her excitement.

Courting, in the sugar world, is the bridge between fantasy and reality. It turns a simple arrangement into something elegant, discreet, and mutually satisfying. It’s not about being old-fashioned; it’s about being intentional. And believe me, the results are worth it—not just for her, but for you as well.",1,1756880744.0,discreetfwbdating,0,1.0,False

The right one will come to you,"Navigating the dating world after being single for a long time can feel like stepping into uncharted territory, but it’s also an opportunity to rediscover yourself and build meaningful connections. First, embrace your independence; your time alone has likely taught you resilience and self-awareness, which are strengths in dating. Spend time reflecting on what you truly want in a partner, focusing on values like kindness or shared interests, rather than rushing to fill a void. Rebuild your confidence by engaging in activities you love, whether it’s hiking, gaming, or exploring new coffee shops, as these can naturally lead to meeting like-minded people. When you start dating, take it slow—opt for low-pressure settings like a casual coffee date to ease back in. Be honest about your feelings and intentions with potential partners, but don’t feel pressured to share your entire history upfront. Online platforms like Tinder or Bumble can help, but ensure your profile reflects your authentic self, highlighting quirks or passions that make you unique. Stay open to rejection or ghosting without taking it personally; it’s part of the process and doesn’t define your worth. Finally, approach dating as an adventure, not a race—focus on enjoying the journey of meeting new people, and let connections grow naturally over time.",16,1756880655.0,dating_advice,6,0.77,False

I hadn’t played a piano since Claire passed away six years ago. She taught me everything: sheet music, posture, patience. Where to loosen up and where to hold tension. She had this heavenly touch when it came to music, soft but deliberate, like her fingers could feel the notes. She was an angel not only in her personality, but in her tune as well.

I wish we could have stayed that way. We could have gotten married, bought a house together, had kids, and grown old with each other.

But then she got diagnosed. Brain cancer. Terminal. It was sudden, and very soon she started to fade. Her eyes lost their glint, her fingers their skill and precision. Eventually, she had to be hospitalized before it all came to an end. In her last few minutes, she told me to keep playing in her memory. I promised her I would as I felt her pulse disappear, holding her hand.

I couldn’t keep my promise, just looking at the keys had me hearing her ghost in every note. I didn’t get rid of the piano, though. It would be like throwing away the last piece of her soul. I kept it covered in a sheet like an unburied corpse. It simply sat there, mourning. Like me.

Then one morning I came into my kitchen and found a letter on the table. I was curious how it got there, but didn’t pay much mind at first. I went to inspect it. It was thick and yellowed, like aged parchment that was just unearthed from a crypt. My full name was written in precise, cursive script—Liam. No stamp, no return address.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. I must’ve been imagining it, because it smelled faintly like Claire’s favorite perfume, some lavender one, but slightly more metallic. It must be her death getting to my senses. I opened the letter and read the text laid bare on it, in the same handwriting of the front.

“To Liam,

You are cordially invited to perform at the Bellmare Concert Hall, located in our old town of Dorset Hollow. One night, one recital.

Compensation: Solace

Mr. Wellers awaits you.”

Just that offer was written, by a name I’ve never heard before, and some faded map at the back. No phone number or email or anything. I actually laughed out loud. Solace? What kind of payment is that? 

Alongside that, I remembered something once. An old story about Dorset Hollow—a fire, they said. Decades ago, the town burned to the ground, swallowed by flames no one could stop. No one ever said what happened after. Not about whether it was rebuilt or left to rot in silence. It was just a ghost of a rumor I barely cared to follow. But now, I was standing on the edge of that forgotten place—with a letter that promised something I didn't quite understand.

I’ll be honest though, it piqued my curiosity. I didn’t decide to take the offer, though. Not at that point. I simply placed the letter back on my kitchen table where I found it.

I dreamed of Claire that night. She was onstage, but not dressed for it. Not in the blue dress she used to wear to her performances. Just herself. Tall, lean. She sat there barefoot in black jeans and a faded Nirvana shirt. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. Her eyes, those deep blue eyes. The kind you look into and can never see the bottom.

She was playing something I didn’t recognize. It was beautiful, yet impossible, like trying to comprehend the full scale of the universe. The music sounded like the concept of grief. Pure, unadulterated grief. Grief so deep it was sacred.

Beneath me, the ground cracked open, and shadowy arms snaked up from the darkness, cold and grasping. They curled around my ankles, dragging me down. I tried to pull away, but they tightened their grip, pulling me deeper into an abyss that smelled of old sorrow and forgotten promises.

Through the shadows, I saw her—Claire—looking down at me. Her face was calm, her eyes full of something I couldn’t name: sorrow, warning, or maybe forgiveness.

“Don’t go,” she said, her voice both near and distant. No fear or worry, just pleading.

I woke up shaking, heart pounding. On my nightstand lay the letter.

I didn’t know why, but I had to find out what it meant. I had to chase the thread of that dream before it pulled me under completely.

The drive took five hours. Back roads all the way. Halfway through, the GPS gave up, so I had to follow the map that was printed on the back of the letter. It was so faint that I could barely make it out. It looked like it was trying to disappear, like it didn’t want to be followed.

The trees grew thicker the closer I got. The road narrowed and the sounds of nature got ever the more hushed. Soon, I could hear nothing but the sound of my engine, but even that started to fade into obscurity. Every bend in the road I took made the sky grow more gray, more dreary, even though there were no clouds. Then I reached the sign.

“Dorset Hollow: A Place for Quiet Reflection”

The town looked preserved. It wasn’t old, wasn’t abandoned, just looked like time had eventually stopped flowing here. They looked like they were from a different time, so I guess that they restored the town to how it looked decades ago after all. Buildings stood straight, yet hollow. The windows were clear, but dark, like they were reflecting moonlight rather than basking in the afternoon glow. The strangest thing was that I didn’t see anyone walking around, yet I knew they were there.

Then I saw the diner. It was simple, modest, but it felt comforting. It looked like it was out of a show and just said DIN(N)ER. Clever. I hadn’t eaten all day, so I pulled in.

The interior looked like it was from 1965. Checkered floors, red booths, even an old jukebox. It smelled like coffee and bacon, with a little bit of floor polish mixed in. Three other customers were seated, an older couple and a guy who looked to be my age. They all looked at me when I entered. They weren’t startled or surprised, just… aware.

I sat down at an empty booth and the waitress came over. Her hair was in a tight ponytail, her lips too red for this tired town. Her smile was perfect, but it didn’t reach her eyes. They looked almost hollow.

“You headed to the concert hall?” she asked as she handed me the menu.

“How’d you know?” I said, wondering what made it obvious.

She shrugged and looked in some general direction. “Not many folks come by here unless they’ve been invited.”

I told her my order but she didn’t write anything down. A few minutes later, she brought me a feast fit for kings. Black coffee and a plate with scrambled eggs and toast. It tasted exactly how breakfast used to taste as a kid. Simple, warm, a little too perfect.

The young man looked at me from his booth. “You play?”

I hesitated a bit before answering, “used to.”

He nodded, like he heard that a million times, before responding, “that’s good enough for Bellmare.”

I forced a smile at him. “You been?”

But he didn’t answer. Just went back to staring at his food.

I reached for my wallet, but the waitress rushed over to stop me.

“It’s covered,” she said.

“By who?”

She just gave a small shrug and said, “Mr. Wellers takes care of his guests.”

“Nice guy”, I said, before tipping her $5 and leaving for Bellmare Hall. It stood at the edge of the town, where the trees became forest. It didn’t fit the town—too big, hollow, imposing. It was made of what looked like marble and stone, like a cathedral for worshiping music. Vines grew up its massive walls like veins, ivy curled around lanterns that still burned, tall stone arches held doors twelve-feet high.

Yet a man stood waiting on its stairs. He was unnaturally tall and scarily thin, fitted into a charcoal-gray suit, and adorning a black top hat under a few tufts of white hair. His skin paper-white and his eyes glazed over. It was like today was his funeral and he forgot to attend.

“You must be Liam,” he said, Southern drawl straight from the bayou. “Mr. Wellers welcomes you.”

His smile was polite, inviting, yet practiced. It didn’t reach his eyes.

“You’re Mr. Wellers?”

He nodded. “Some call me that.”

“Is that what you call you?”

He titled his head to the side and let out a slight smirk, like he was amused by my question. “Mr. Wellers prefers to keep things proper.” 

That didn’t answer anything, but I let it go.

“The folks at the diner said you covered my meal,” I said.

“Wellers takes care of his guests,” he responded and grinned. That grin again, it felt off. Like he imitated it from people he watched, rather than actually feeling anything. He then motioned to the doors and opened them for me. “Shall we?”

As I stepped foot into the building, I almost had a double-take. It was beautiful. The lobby was lit by crystal chandeliers, with red velvet carpets adorning every footstep. The walls were paneled with dark, polished wood that reflected so much light that it hurt to look at for too long. But then we entered the concert hall.

I was in shock, it was massive. Bigger than it should have been, judging by the size of the building from the outside. Rows upon rows of empty seats faced the stage. There laid upon it, like the crown jewel of the town, was the piano. A black lacquer, full grand, in perfect condition. It was like it was never played, but still waited for centuries to perform.

It wasn’t Claire’s piano, I knew that for sure. But something about it seemed so familiar, so comforting. Yet, so off. It simultaneously raised the hair on my arms and made my heart skip a beat.

I stepped toward it slowly. 

“She’s a piece of beauty,” Wellers said behind me. “Specially made for this hall.”

“She looks…” I paused, searching for the right word. “Hungry.”

He chuckled softly. “Music’s always been a hungry thing. Takes what you give it. Sometimes more.”

There was something in his voice. It had a weight to it, a surety. Maybe it was grief. Like he was mourning something yet to happen.

I turned to face him. “You sound like you’re giving a eulogy.”

“Do I?” he said, smooth as ever.

I blinked. That struck me wrong.

“You.. usually refer to yourself in the third person,” I said. “But just this moment, you didn't.""

He paused, then smiled and said, “Mr. Wellers finds it…easier that way. Keeps things separate.”

I was about to question him on that, but he quickly gestured towards the piano and said, “You’ll have time to prepare. The recital is tomorrow”

“Why have one anyway? There was barely anyone in town.” I turned towards the empty rows of seats. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. A flash of color. A flicker of blue in the far corner of the front row. But the instant I looked directly at it, there was nothing there.

In the foreground, a detective in a trench coat stands under a flickering streetlamp, rain soaking his shoulders. In the background, the neon sign of a desolate bar reflects in a puddle. A caption box at the top reads ""The city was a tough place to keep secrets."" The lighting is harsh, creating a dramatic, somber mood. Landscape.",1,1756880279.0,Geminibanana,0,1.0,False

- Over 3,000 miles of travel across six time zones, serviced by a business‑class charter flight.
- Planning started nine months ahead, securing a suitable hotel, venue and flight logistics before the opponent was confirmed.
- A scouting delegation visited Astana ten weeks before kick‑off to photograph the stadium, verify the artificial 4G pitch, inspect showers, changing rooms and bus drop‑off zones, and review fan ticket allocations and safety.
- Five weeks out, players received detailed itineraries; the kit department packed more than 60 items, including a coffee machine, widescreen televisions and a heat‑press for on‑site shirt numbering.
- Two weeks before the match the final squad list was locked, a direct Cardiff‑Astana charter flight was confirmed and hotel rooms were prepared as temporary physio and kit areas.
- On matchday, coordinated briefings, transport and equipment setup ensured the squad could focus solely on the 90‑minute contest.

Why it matters: thorough logistics aim to minimise fatigue and give Wales the best possible conditions for performance.
