I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 2],"[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1nrceud/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/)

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

My name is Tree (they/them).
I’m 27 years old (assuming I use the pitiful Eurocentric Gregorian calendar). I believe in not taking care of myself, and a Dunkin'/Checkers/Popeyes diet and zero exercise routine. 

In the morning, if my underarms aren't hairy enough, I’ll put on a minoxidil cream while doing my ketamine bumps. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the excess minoxidil cream I use a USDA-certified organic aluminum-free deodorant.
In the sh*wer I use a charcoal-activated oat milk cleanser, then a strawberry matcha body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating kombucha scrub. Then I apply a medium-roast French coffee facial masque which I leave on for 30 seconds while I prepare the rest of my routine and avoid doing my dishes. I never use an aftershave lotion, because I don't shave (shaving dries your hair follicles out and makes you look cis). Then unscented moisturizer, then an anti-Gemini eyeshadow followed by a final unscented moisturizing lotion. 

There is an idea of a Tree (they/them). Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can flip my septum ring up when I need to ask my parents for rent money, and you can sense my pheromones and feel my sweat drip onto your flesh, and maybe you can even sense our L Train Vintage hauls are probably comparable, I simply am not there.",0,1759522150.0,Bushwick,0,0.2,False

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

Speech Transcript

Members of the faculty and members of the student body of this great institution of learning; ladies and gentlemen.

Now there are several things that one could talk about before such a large, concerned, and enlightened audience. There are so many problems facing our nation and our world, that one could just take off anywhere. But today I would like to talk mainly about the race problems since I'll have to rush right out and go to New York to talk about Vietnam tomorrow and I've been talking about it a great deal this week and weeks before that.

But I'd like to use a subject from which to speak this afternoon, the Other America.

And I use this subject because there are literally two Americas. One America is beautiful for situation. And, in a sense, this America is overflowing with the milk of prosperity and the honey of opportunity. This America is the habitat of millions of people who have food and material necessities for their bodies; and culture and education for their minds; and freedom and human dignity for their spirits. In this America, millions of people experience every day the opportunity of having life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in all of their dimensions. And in this America millions of young people grow up in the sunlight of opportunity.

But tragically and unfortunately, there is another America. This other America has a daily ugliness about it that constantly transforms the ebulliency of hope into the fatigue of despair. In this America millions of work-starved men walk the streets daily in search for jobs that do not exist. In this America millions of people find themselves living in rat-infested, vermin-filled slums. In this America people are poor by the millions. They find themselves perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.

In a sense, the greatest tragedy of this other America is what it does to little children. Little children in this other America are forced to grow up with clouds of inferiority forming every day in their little mental skies. As we look at this other America, we see it as an arena of blasted hopes and shattered dreams. Many people of various backgrounds live in this other America. Some are Mexican Americans, some are Puerto Ricans, some are Indians, some happen to be from other groups. Millions of them are Appalachian whites. But probably the largest group in this other America in proportion to its size in the population is the American Negro.

The American Negro finds himself living in a triple ghetto. A ghetto of race, a ghetto of poverty, a ghetto of human misery. So what we are seeking to do in the Civil Rights Movement is to deal with this problem. To deal with this problem of the two Americas. We are seeking to make America one nation, Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Now let me say that the struggle for Civil Rights and the struggle to make these two Americas one America, is much more difficult today than it was five or ten years ago. For about a decade or maybe twelve years, we've struggled all across the South in glorious struggles to get rid of legal, overt segregation and all of the humiliation that surrounded that system of segregation.

In a sense this was a struggle for decency; we could not go to a lunch counter in so many instances and get a hamburger or a cup of coffee. We could not make use of public accommodations. Public transportation was segregated, and often we had to sit in the back and within transportation — transportation within cities — we often had to stand over empty seats because sections were reserved for whites only. We did not have the right to vote in so many areas of the South. And the struggle was to deal with these problems.

And certainly they were difficult problems, they were humiliating conditions. By the thousands we protested these conditions. We made it clear that it was ultimately more honorable to accept jail cell experiences than to accept segregation and humiliation. By the thousands students and adults decided to sit in at segregated lunch counters to protest conditions there. When they were sitting at those lunch counters they were in reality standing up for the best in the American dream and seeking to take the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

Many things were gained as a result of these years of struggle. In 1964 the Civil Rights Bill came into being after the Birmingham movement which did a great deal to subpoena the conscience of a large segment of the nation to appear before the judgment seat of morality on the whole question of Civil Rights. After the Selma movement in 1965 we were able to get a Voting Rights Bill. And all of these things represented strides.

But we must see that the struggle today is much more difficult. It's more difficult today because we are struggling now for genuine equality. It's much easier to integrate a lunch counter than it is to guarantee a livable income and a good solid job. It's much easier to guarantee the right to vote than it is to guarantee the right to live in sanitary, decent housing conditions. It is much easier to integrate a public park than it is to make genuine, quality, integrated education a reality. And so today we are struggling for something which says we demand genuine equality.

It's not merely a struggle against extremist behavior toward Negroes. And I'm convinced that many of the very people who supported us in the struggle in the South are not willing to go all the way now. I came to see this in a very difficult and painful way in Chicago the last year where I've lived and worked. Some of the people who came quickly to march with us in Selma and Birmingham weren't active around Chicago. And I came to see that so many people who supported morally and even financially what we were doing in Birmingham and Selma, were really outraged against the extremist behavior of Bull Connor and Jim Clark toward Negroes, rather than believing in genuine equality for Negroes. And I think this is what we've gotta see now, and this is what makes the struggle much more difficult.

So as a result of all of this, we see many problems existing today that are growing more difficult. It's something that is often overlooked, but Negroes generally live in worse slums today than 20 or 25 years ago. In the North schools are more segregated today than they were in 1954 when the Supreme Court's decision on desegregation was rendered. Economically the Negro Is worse off today than he was 15 and 20 years ago. And so the unemployment rate among Whites at one time was about the same as the unemployment rate among Negroes. But today the unemployment rate among Negroes is twice that of Whites. And the average income of the Negro is today 50% less than Whites.

As we look at these problems we see them growing and developing every day. We see the fact that the Negro economically is facing a depression in his everyday life that is more staggering than the depression of the 30's. The unemployment rate of the nation as a whole is about 4%. Statistics would say from the Labor Department that among Negroes it's about 8.4%. But these are the persons who are in the labor market, who still go to employment agencies to seek jobs, and so they can be calculated. The statistics can be gotten because they are still somehow in the labor market.

But there are hundreds of thousands of Negroes who have given up. They've lost hope. They've come to feel that life is a long and desolate corridor for them with no Exit sign, and so they no longer go to look for a job. There are those who would estimate that these persons, who are called the Discouraged Persons, these 6 or 7% in the Negro community, that means that unemployment among Negroes may well be 16%. Among Negro youth in some of our larger urban areas it goes to 30 and 40%. So you can see what I mean when I say that, in the Negro community, there is a major, tragic and staggering depression that we face in our everyday lives.

Now the other thing that we've gotta come to see now that many of us didn't see too well during the last ten years — that is that racism is still alive in American society. And much more wide-spread than we realized. And we must see racism for what it is. It is a myth of the superior and the inferior race. It is the false and tragic notion that one particular group, one particular race is responsible for all of the progress, all of the insights in the total flow of history. And the theory that another group or another race is totally depraved, innately impure, and innately inferior.

In the final analysis, racism is evil because its ultimate logic is genocide. Hitler was a sick and tragic man who carried racism to its logical conclusion. He ended up leading a nation to the point of killing about 6 million Jews. This is the tragedy of racism because its ultimate logic is genocide. If one says that I am not good enough to live next door to him; if one says that I am not good enough to eat at a lunch counter, or to have a good, decent job, or to go to school with him merely because of my race, he is saying consciously or unconsciously that I do not deserve to exist.

To use a philosophical analogy here, racism is not based on some empirical generalization; it is based rather on an ontological affirmation. It is not the assertion that certain people are behind culturally or otherwise because of environmental conditions. It is the affirmation that the very being of a people is inferior. And this is the great tragedy of it.

I submit that however unpleasant it is we must honestly see and admit that racism is still deeply rooted all over America. It is still deeply rooted in the North, and it's still deeply rooted in the South.

And this leads me to say something about another discussion that we hear a great deal, and that is the so-called ""white backlash"". I would like to honestly say to you that the white backlash is merely a new name for an old phenomenon. It's not something that just came into being because of shouts of Black Power, or because Negroes engaged in riots in Watts, for instance. The fact is that the state of California voted a Fair Housing bill out of existence before anybody shouted Black Power, or before anybody rioted in Watts.

It may well be that shouts of Black Power and riots in Watts and the Harlems and the other areas, are the consequences of the white backlash rather than the cause of them. What it is necessary to see is that there has never been a single solid monistic determined commitment on the part of the vast majority of white Americans on the whole question of Civil Rights and on the whole question of racial equality. This is something that truth impels all men of good will to admit.

It is said on the Statue of Liberty that America is a home of exiles. It doesn't take us long to realize that America has been the home of its white exiles from Europe. But it has not evinced the same kind of maternal care and concern for its black exiles from Africa. It is no wonder that in one of his sorrow songs, the Negro could sing out, ""Sometimes I feel like a motherless child."" What great estrangement, what great sense of rejection caused a people to emerge with such a metaphor as they looked over their lives.

What I'm trying to get across is that our nation has constantly taken a positive step forward on the question of racial justice and racial equality. But over and over again at the same time, it made certain backward steps. And this has been the persistence of the so called white backlash.

In 1863 the Negro was freed from the bondage of physical slavery. But at the same time, the nation refused to give him land to make that freedom meaningful. And at that same period America was giving millions of acres of land in the West and the Midwest, which meant that America was willing to undergird its white peasants from Europe with an economic floor that would make it possible to grow and develop, and refused to give that economic floor to its black peasants, so to speak.

This is why Frederick Douglas could say that emancipation for the Negro was freedom to hunger, freedom to the winds and rains of heaven, freedom without roofs to cover their heads. He went on to say that it was freedom without bread to eat, freedom without land to cultivate. It was freedom and famine at the same time. But it does not stop there.

In 1875 the nation passed a Civil Rights Bill and refused to enforce it. In 1964 the nation passed a weaker Civil Rights Bill and even to this day, that bill has not been totally enforced in all of its dimensions. The nation heralded a new day of concern for the poor, for the poverty stricken, for the disadvantaged. And brought into being a Poverty Bill and at the same time it put such little money into the program that it was hardly, and still remains hardly, a good skirmish against poverty. White politicians in suburbs talk eloquently against open housing, and in the same breath contend that they are not racist. And all of this, and all of these things tell us that America has been backlashing on the whole question of basic constitutional and God-given rights for Negroes and other disadvantaged groups for more than 300 years.

So these conditions, existence of widespread poverty, slums, and of tragic conniptions in schools and other areas of life, all of these things have brought about a great deal of despair, and a great deal of desperation. A great deal of disappointment and even bitterness in the Negro communities. And today all of our cities confront huge problems. All of our cities are potentially powder kegs as a result of the continued existence of these conditions. Many in moments of anger, many in moments of deep bitterness engage in riots.

Let me say as I've always said, and I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating. I'm still convinced that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom and justice. I feel that violence will only create more social problems than they will solve. That in a real sense it is impracticable for the Negro to even think of mounting a violent revolution in the United States. So I will continue to condemn riots, and continue to say to my brothers and sisters that this is not the way. And continue to affirm that there is another way.

But at the same time, it is as necessary for me to be as vigorous in condemning the conditions which cause persons to feel that they must engage in riotous activities as it is for me to condemn riots. I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation's summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.

Now let me go on to say that if we are to deal with all of the problems that I've talked about, and if we are to bring America to the point that we have one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, there are certain things that we must do. The job ahead must be massive and positive. We must develop massive action programs all over the United States of America in order to deal with the problems that I have mentioned. Now in order to develop these massive action programs we've got to get rid of one or two false notions that continue to exist in our society. One is the notion that only time can solve the problem of racial injustice. I'm sure you've heard this idea. It is the notion almost that there is something in the very flow of time that will miraculously cure all evils. And I've heard this over and over again. There are those, and they are often sincere people, who say to Negroes and their allies In the white community, that we should slow up and just be nice and patient and continue to pray, and in a hundred or two hundred years the problem will work itself out because only time can solve the problem.

I think there is an answer to that myth. And it is that time is neutral. It can be used either constructively or destructively. And I'm absolutely convinced that the forces of ill-will in our nation, the extreme rightists in our nation, have often used time much more effectively than the forces of good will. And it may well be that we will have to repent in this generation not merely for the vitriolic words of the bad people and the violent actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence and indifference of the good people who sit around and say wait on time. Somewhere we must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated Individuals. And without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of social stagnation. And so we must help time, and we must realize that the time is always right to do right.

Now there's another notion that gets out, it's around everywhere. It's in the South, it's in the North, it's In California, and all over our nation. It's the notion that legislation can't solve the problem, it can't do anything in this area. And those who project this argument contend that you've got to change the heart and that you can't change the heart through legislation. Now I would be the first one to say that there is real need for a lot of heart changing in our country, and I believe in changing the heart. I preach about it. I believe in the need for conversion in many instances, and regeneration, to use theological terms. And I would be the first to say that if the race problem In America is to be solved, the white person must treat the Negro right, not merely because the law says it, but because it's natural, because It's right, and because the Negro is his brother. And so I realize that if we are to have a truly integrated society, men and women will have to rise to the majestic heights of being obedient to the unenforceable.

But after saying this, let me say another thing which gives the other side, and that is that although it may be true that morality cannot be legislated, behavior can be regulated. Even though it may be true that the law cannot change the heart, it can restrain the heartless. Even though it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, it can restrain him from lynching me. And I think that's pretty important also. And so while the law may not change the hearts of men, it can and it does change the habits of men. And when you begin to change the habits of men, pretty soon the attitudes will be changed; pretty soon the hearts will be changed. And I'm convinced that we still need strong civil rights legislation. And there is a bill before Congress right now to have a national or federal Open Housing Bill. A federal law declaring discrimination in housing unconstitutional.

And also a bill to make the administration of justice real all over our country. Now nobody can doubt the need for this. Nobody can doubt the need if he thinks about the fact that since 1963 some 50 Negroes and white Civil Rights workers have been brutally murdered in the state of Mississippi alone, and not a single person has been convicted for these dastardly crimes. There have been some indictments but no one has been convicted. And so there is a need for a federal law dealing with the whole question of the administration of justice.

There is a need for fair housing laws all over our country. And it is tragic indeed that Congress last year allowed this bill to die. And when that bill died in Congress, a bit of democracy died, a bit of our commitment to justice died. If it happens again in this session of Congress, a greater degree of our commitment to democratic principles will die. And I can see no more dangerous trend in our country than the constant developing of predominantly Negro central cities ringed by white suburbs. This is only inviting social disaster. And the only way this problem will be solved is by the nation taking a strong stand, and by state governments taking a strong stand against housing segregation and against discrimination in all of these areas.

Now there's another thing that I'd like to mention as I talk about the massive action program and time will not permit me to go into specific programmatic action to any great degree. But it must be realized now that the Negro cannot solve the problems by himself. There again, there are those who always say to Negroes, ""Why don't you do something for yourself? Why don't you lift yourselves by your own bootstraps?"" And we hear this over and over again.

Now certainly there are many things that we must do for ourselves and that only we can do for ourselves. Certainly we must develop within a sense of dignity and self-respect that nobody else can give us. A sense of manhood, a sense of personhood, a sense of not being ashamed of our heritage, not being ashamed of our color. It was wrong and tragic of the Negro ever to allow himself to be ashamed of the fact that he was black, or ashamed of the fact that his ancestral home was Africa. And so there is a great deal that the Negro can do to develop self respect. There is a great deal that the Negro must do and can do to amass political and economic power within his own community and by using his own resources. And so we must do certain things for ourselves but this must not negate the fact, and cause the nation to overlook the fact, that the Negro cannot solve the problem himself.

A man was on the plane with me some weeks ago and he came up to me and said, ""The problem, Dr. King, that I see with what you all are doing is that every time I see you and other Negroes, you're protesting and you aren't doing anything for yourselves."" And he went on to tell me that he was very poor at one time, and he was able to make by doing something for himself. ""Why don't you teach your people,"" he said, ""to lift themselves by their own bootstraps?"" And then he went on to say other groups faced disadvantages, the Irish, the Italian, and he went down the line.

And I said to him that it does not help the Negro, it only deepens his frustration, upon feeling insensitive people to say to him that other ethnic groups who migrated or were immigrants to this country less than a hundred years or so ago, have gotten beyond him and he came here some 344 years ago. And I went on to remind him that the Negro came to this country involuntarily in chains, while others came voluntarily. I went on to remind him that no other racial group has been a slave on American soil. I went on to remind him that the other problem we have faced over the years is that this society placed a stigma on the color of the Negro, on the color of his skin because he was black. Doors were closed to him that were not closed to other groups.

And I finally said to him that it's a nice thing to say to people that you oughta lift yourself by your own bootstraps, but it is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he oughta lift himself by his own bootstraps. And the fact is that millions of Negroes, as a result of centuries of denial and neglect, have been left bootless. They find themselves impoverished aliens in this affluent society. And there is a great deal that the society can and must do if the Negro is to gain the economic security that he needs.

Now one of the answers it seems to me, is a guaranteed annual income, a guaranteed minimum income for all people, and for our families of our country. It seems to me that the Civil Rights movement must now begin to organize for the guaranteed annual income. Begin to organize people all over our country, and mobilize forces so that we can bring to the attention of our nation this need, and this is something which I believe will go a long long way toward dealing with the Negro's economic problem and the economic problem which many other poor people confront in our nation. Now I said I wasn't going to talk about Vietnam, but I can't make a speech without mentioning some of the problems that we face there because I think this war has diverted attention from civil rights. It has strengthened the forces of reaction in our country and has brought to the forefront the military-industrial complex that even President Eisenhower warned us against at one time. And above all, it is destroying human lives. It's destroying the lives of thousands of the young promising men of our nation. It's destroying the lives of little boys and little girls In Vietnam.

But one of the greatest things that this war is doing to us in Civil Rights is that it is allowing the Great Society to be shot down on the battlefields of Vietnam every day. And I submit this afternoon that we can end poverty in the United States. Our nation has the resources to do it. The National Gross Product of America will rise to the astounding figure of some $780 billion this year. We have the resources: The question is, whether our nation has the will, and I submit that if we can spend $35 billion a year to fight an ill-considered war in Vietnam, and $20 billion to put a man on the moon, our nation can spend billions of dollars to put God's children on their own two feet right here on earth.

Let me say another thing that's more in the realm of the spirit I guess, that is that if we are to go on in the days ahead and make true brotherhood a reality, it is necessary for us to realize more than ever before, that the destinies of the Negro and the white man are tied together. Now there are still a lot of people who don't realize this. The racists still don't realize this. But it is a fact now that Negroes and whites are tied together, and we need each other. The Negro needs the white man to save him from his fear. The white man needs the Negro to save him from his guilt. We are tied together in so many ways, our language, our music, our cultural patterns, our material prosperity, and even our food are an amalgam of black and white.

So there can be no separate black path to power and fulfillment that does not intersect white groups. There can be no separate white path to power and fulfillment short of social disaster. It does not recognize the need of sharing that power with black aspirations for freedom and justice. We must come to see now that integration is not merely a romantic or esthetic something where you merely add color to a still predominantly white power structure. Integration must be seen also in political terms where there is shared power, where black men and white men share power together to build a new and a great nation.

In a real sense, we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. John Donne placed it years ago in graphic terms, ""No man is an island entire of itself. Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."" And he goes on toward the end to say, ""Any man's death diminishes me because I'm Involved in mankind. Therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee."" And so we are all in the same situation: the salvation of the Negro will mean the salvation of the white man. And the destruction of life and of the ongoing progress of the Negro will be the destruction of the ongoing progress of the nation.

Now let me say finally that we have difficulties ahead but I haven't despaired. Somehow I maintain hope in spite of hope. And I've talked about the difficulties and how hard the problems will be as we tackle them. But I want to close by saying this afternoon, that I still have faith in the future. And I still believe that these problems can be solved. And so I will not join anyone who will say that we still can't develop a coalition of conscience.

I realize and understand the discontent and the agony and the disappointment and even the bitterness of those who feel that whites in America cannot be trusted. And I would be the first to say that there are all too many who are still guided by the racist ethos. And I am still convinced that there are still many white persons of good will. And I'm happy to say that I see them every day in the student generation who cherish democratic principles and justice above principle, and who will stick with the cause of justice and the cause of Civil Rights and the cause of peace throughout the days ahead. And so I refuse to despair. I think we're gonna achieve our freedom because however much America strays away from the ideals of justice, the goal of America is freedom.

Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up in the destiny of America. Before the pilgrim fathers landed at Plymouth we were here. Before Jefferson etched across the pages of history the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence, we were here. Before the beautiful words of the Star Spangled Banner were written, we were here. For more than two centuries, our forebearers labored here without wages. They made cotton king. They built the homes of their masters in the midst of the most humiliating and oppressive conditions. And yet out of a bottomless vitality, they continued to grow and develop.

And I say that if the inexpressible cruelties of slavery couldn't stop us, the opposition that we now face, including the so-called white backlash, will surely fail. We're gonna win our freedom because both the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of the Almighty God are embodied in our echoing demands.

And so I can still sing ""We Shall Overcome."" We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward Justice. We shall overcome because Carlyle is right, ""No lie can live forever."" We shall overcome because William Cullen Bryant is right, ""Truth crushed to earth will rise again."" We shall overcome because James Russell Lowell is right, ""Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne — Yet that scaffold sways the future."" With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.

With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discourse of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to speed up the day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and live together as brothers and sisters, all over this great nation. That will be a great day, that will be a great tomorrow. In the words of the Scripture, to speak symbolically, that will be the day when the morning stars will sing together and the sons of God will shout for ",1,1759521799.0,blackamerica,0,1.0,False
1nx9lcz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nx9lcz,"Mahalo nui, Kaua'i","Just got back from a week on Kaua'i and thought I'd share some of the stuff we did and places we ate, since people are always looking for recommendations. We really wanted to distract ourselves from some stuff at home, so I purposely packed this trip fuller than I normally would, and we didn't get too much sit-on-the-beach relaxation time (as evidenced by the length of this post).

Everything was so great, even though it rained torrentially on and off the first couple of days we were there. (Honestly it was pretty cool since we live in SoCal and rain is almost a foreign concept here. Also it's a tropical island? Rain happens, it's fine.) We split our time 50/50 in the North and South so we could see more of the island and all its micro-climates and communities. I had a lot planned, but I took the rain as Mother Nature's way of telling me to chill out: our boat tour (morning Nā Pali coast) and pineapple tour (Sugarloaf) were both cancelled. I thought about trying to reschedule the boat but ultimately decided to save it for another trip. Next time I'm not sure if I'd split the trip the same way, only because it's nice to just check in to one place and not have to worry about moving.

**Lodging**

North: we stayed at the Club Wyndham Bali Hai Villas because I had points and it was free. It's in Princeville, which is a nice community but kind of a pain to get to and from if you're doing a lot of driving around the island, IMO. The units are nice enough, though dated, and we had some ants in the bathroom. Not all units have A/C, and I'd recommend requesting one on the second floor so you don't hear anyone above you. Also the bed suuuuuuuuuucked. Tons of nene and chickens on the property, which *will* start crowing at/before dawn, so download a white noise app if you need it.

South: we splurged on the Grand Hyatt for a few nights through Costco. I HIGHLY recommend booking through them--it ended up being a couple hundred dollars more than if I'd booked through the hotel, but that also included our rental car, hotel breakfast, the resort fee, and a $300 hotel credit (which we used at the spa). The hotel was super nice, had beautiful grounds and an adults-only pool area, and everyone who worked there was friendly. Would stay there again, but only if I could do it on points or if someone else was paying.

**Activities**

\- Kauai Backcountry Adventures tubing: this was SO fun and such a unique experience. Wear a rash guard and be careful if you have *any* back or joint problems. We got spun around and bumped into rocky walls a lot. Would be super fun with kids. There are lots of tunnels, and as a super claustrophobic person who has to take meds to fly or get an MRI, I was totally fine.

\- Kilauea Mini Golf: we did this on a whim when our boat got cancelled. We were in the rain, which I don't really recommend, but otherwise this is such a unique and frankly beautiful mini golf course. It's also a little botanical garden and has lots of information about plants and Hawaiian history throughout, which was cool for a couple of nerds like us. AND it was the first time I beat my husband at mini golf! There's also a farmers market next door on Saturday.

\- Lydgate Chocolate Farm tour: this is pricey, but if you like chocolate and/or like learning things, this is really a must. It's gorgeous, you get to eat raw cacao fruit, and they give you so much chocolate to taste. If you're just interested in the chocolate tasting, stop by their location in Kapa'a. It's free! This was probably both my and my husband's favorite thing we did.

\- Kauai Humane Society: we took a dog out on a field trip for the day (Ms. Snuffy) and had a blast. If you like dogs and want to do something nice for the local community, please do it. We went on a little hike up to the cliff at Shipwrecks, which was pretty cool.

\- Waimea Canyon: we drove up as far as we could go and stopped wherever we could. It's breathtaking. You can hike if you want, or you can just do the drive if you're not super active. There's also a little natural history museum up there that's pretty cool.

\- Kauai Coffee Company: this is a cute self-guided walk through part of the plantation, and there's a free coffee tasting as well. We picked up some whole beans they only sell there ($$$). Shirley at the coffee tasting station was super cool!

\- Farmers markets: there's at least one somewhere on the island every day. Go, try some new stuff, buy things from locals, get some sugar cane juice with lime. Ever heard of eggfruit? I hadn't, and it's delicious!

**Food**

We are food people. We ate a lot. I don't think we had a single bad meal, and I know we missed a lot of stuff. I wanted to get to more of the bakeries, but we just didn't have time or the stomach space. This is everywhere we went (I also have pictures of almost everything, if anyone wants to see anything specific):

\- Aloha Roasters (Lihue): stopped here after landing for coffee, would definitely recommend.

\- Musubi Truck (multiple locations, we went to Kapa'a): so tasty. They have a selection of musubi and some poke, but we both ended up getting Da Bomb and some tater tots. Honestly maybe the best tater tots I've ever had?

\- Foodland: do not sleep on the Foodland hot bar (or deli counter, or poke, or sushi, etc. etc.). Especially if you're in Princeville, where there are like four restaurants nearby in Hanalei that all close at 8:30, Foodland is a great choice. Seriously though, you can get a really solid poke bowl for like $9. It's also a super happening place at night when everyone realizes nothing else is open. The sushi at Kilauea market is the same as Foodland, btw. Also got my requisite butter mochi there (ube) and it did not disappoint.

\- Kilauea Bakery: honestly not everything we had here was *amazing*, but the malasada and Danish were solid. I have a feeling we didn't order the right things.

\- Kilauea Fish Market: by the time we got there, there was only one poke left, but it was good. Mac salad was also pretty solid. Spicy pork was super tasty.

\- Familee Korean Shave Ice (Kapa'a): YO. I will admit I'm an idiot sometimes, but I did not realize these dudes are shaving milk, not ice, and couldn't figure out how it was so fucking good. Less sweet than traditional Hawaiian shave ice, somewhat limited selection, would 1000% go back and try everything.

\- Wake Up Delicious (Hanalei): limited options, but pretty tasty, also huge burritos. Pork with cabbage was great.

\- Holey Grail Donuts (Hanalei, but multiple locations): these are delicious fresh and I would 100% recommend, but leave them for more than an hour and the texture is way off. Get the fruity ones! Also the iced chai latte was great.

\- Bar Acuda (Hanelei): TBH we only ate here because I have a Resy credit with my Amex, and this is the only Resy restaurant on the island. Everything we had was delicious. It's pricey for what it is, but it's also a nice restaurant on Kauai, so it's to be expected.

\- Silver Cloud Eatery (Kilauea): these breakfast burritos were *nuts*, and the couple running the place are some of the nicest people I've ever met. The Kalua pork was delicious, but I liked the Cubano better, and I had them add some breadfruit ""potatoes"" to it. Get them smothered in sauce. You're welcome.

\- Smiley's (Lihue): we heard this was the place to go for a mixed plate. We heard correctly. Also their chicken katsu was fantastic. Their pumpkin crunch was also tasty. Everything was good. They've been around forever; they know what's up.

\- Jojo's Shave Ice (Waimea, but they have other locations): this was by far the best traditional shave ice I've ever had. Maybe had something to do with the mac nut ice cream on the bottom? Syrups aren't overly sweet and are packed with flavor. Seems like a huge portion and I didn't think I'd get through half of it; ate the whole thing and wanted another.

\- Sushi Station (Lihue, across the street from Costco): this is the spot for sushi, my friends. Nigiri, maki, American-style rolls, all of it. The fish is so fresh, the rice is perfect, and the presentation is so nice. Mad that we didn't eat here sooner so we could come back. 100/10.

\- Porky's (Koloa): the Kalua pork, which is their staple, was tasty but too salty. But on the grilled cheese and in the other dishes along with the other elements? Tasty!

\- Koloa Mill Ice Cream & Coffee: really tasty ice cream! I got the Kona mud pie.

\- Hotel food at the Grand Hyatt: it's fine. I've had better breakfast buffets, but it's pretty good. Decent variety, excellent service, and I don't know what they put in the French toast, but I could at that shit all day. Ordered room service once on our last day and it was fine, nothing to write home about. Would definitely opt for off-campus meals next time.

Overall, everyone on the island was SO nice, it was beyond beautiful, and while the humidity ultimately wiped us out, we didn't want to leave. I hope we were good guests, because Kaua'i was an excellent host.",3,1759521766.0,VisitingHawaii,2,1.0,False

I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 2],"[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1nrcbfe/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/)

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

1nx9j1r,https://i.redd.it/yznvs306dysf1.jpeg,Pros and Cons of Investing in Farms for Sale Near Me,"Advantages and Drawbacks of Investing in Rural Land for Sale Near Me\
\
Investing in rural land for sale near your location can present a profitable and fulfilling endeavor. From the pure air to the stunning sceneries, there are several appealing characteristics to land ownership. Nonetheless, like any financial commitment, there are also various potential downsides to keep in mind. In this article, we will delve into the advantages and drawbacks of investing in rural land for sale near you.\
\
Advantages of Investing in Rural Land for Sale Near Me\
\
1. Possibility of High Return on Investment\
Investing in rural land can result in a high return on investment. With the growing demand for organic and locally-produced goods, there is an increasing likelihood for profitability in the agricultural industry. By owning land and cultivating your own crops or livestock, you have the opportunity to take advantage of this demand and generate a substantial income.\
\
2. Land Appreciation\
Land has historically been a reliable investment, and rural land is no different. As the population continues to expand, the demand for cultivable land is also increasing. Over time, the value of rural land tends to appreciate, making it a dependable long-term investment.\
\
3. Diversification\
Investing in rural land offers an opportunity to diversify your investment portfolio. Unlike conventional stocks and bonds, farmland is a tangible asset with intrinsic value. By diversifying your portfolio with rural land, you can mitigate your overall investment risk and potentially enhance your returns.\
\
4. Tax Incentives\
Owning rural land can offer several tax advantages. Landowners may be eligible for tax breaks such as deductions for property taxes, mortgage interest, and depreciation. Additionally, there are special tax incentives for agricultural producers that can further reduce the tax burden on land-related income.\
\
5. Personal Fulfillment\
For many stakeholders, owning land is not just about financial gain. It provides an opportunity to connect with nature and engage in an environmentally sustainable lifestyle. Land ownership can bring a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that goes beyond monetary value.\
\
Drawbacks of Investing in Rural Land for Sale Near Me\
\
1. Significant Initial Expenses\
One of the primary barriers to investing in rural land is the substantial upfront cost. Acquiring rural land requires a significant capital investment, whether you are purchasing property, equipment, or livestock. Additionally, there are ongoing costs associated with land maintenance and operation, such as seed, fertilizer, and labor.\
\
2. Market Fluctuations\
Like any commodity, the agricultural market is subject to price volatility. Fluctuations in crop prices, changes in government policies, and unpredictable weather patterns can all impact the profitability of rural land. As a result, investors in rural land need to be prepared to endure market fluctuations and potential financial losses.\
\
3. Time and Dedication\
Owning rural land requires a considerable amount of time and dedication. Farming is not a passive investment and often necessitates hands-on management and physical labor. Whether it's tending to crops, caring for livestock, or maintaining equipment, landowners need to be prepared to invest their time and energy into the operation.\
\
4. Environmental and Regulatory Variables\
Farming is subject to an extensive array of environmental and regulatory variables that can impact operations. Compliance with environmental regulations, water usage restrictions, and zoning laws can all affect a farm's ability to operate and its profitability. Additionally, changes in government policies related to agriculture can create uncertainty and additional challenges for landowners.\
\
5. Limited Liquidity\
Unlike stocks or bonds, rural land is not a liquid investment. It can be challenging to quickly sell land, especially during economic downturns or when the real estate market is weak. This lack of liquidity can make it difficult for investors to exit their investment if needed.\
\
Conclusion\
\
Investing in rural land for sale near you presents both potential advantages and risks. Before making a decision, it is important to carefully consider both the advantages and drawbacks of land ownership. The potential for a high return on investment, land appreciation, and tax benefits make rural land an attractive investment option. However, the significant initial expenses, market fluctuations, and time commitment required for land ownership are important factors to consider. By weighing these factors and conducting thorough research, investors can make informed decisions about whether investing in rural land is the right choice for them.\

I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 2],"[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nrc81n/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/)

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

I love the outdoors, I hike, camp, backpack, ski tour (split board), mountaineer, climb, I have done some modelling for luxury brands (I do love discovering great textiles), I cycle (both mountain biking xc and road), I love great food (coffee as well), beer, and love being active, I do also collect watches but won't be making my way to geneva this trip. I also do like to check out museums and art too. I do prefer finding small gems (smaller towns where there is more to explore or some outdoor activities).

Dec 4-6: Zurich ( I was also thinking of taking a train to lucerne during one of these days)

Dec 6-8: Zermatt

Dec 8-9: Interlaken

Dec 9-11: Basel and from there I am headed to Hanover in Germany where I will meet up with a friend of mine and explore Hamburg and Bremen.

11-15 I'll be in Germany and then fly out from Switzerland in zurich on the 16th.

Any help would be greatly appreciated as I would want to travel as a local and check out more local spots. If you think I should spend more time in some places then please let me know.

1nx9ic9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1nx9ic9/carl_hiaasen_books_in_order/,Carl Hiaasen Books In Order,"Hey everyone! I just finished a book that's been living rent-free in my head, and I really wanted to share my thoughts with you all. Sometimes you just need to dive into something new, right? Speaking of discovering authors, if you're ever in the mood for some fantastic crime fiction with a satirical twist, you might want to check out [Carl Hiaasen Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/carl-hiaasen-books-in-order/). It's a great resource for getting into his work! But for now, let's talk about my latest read.

### My Latest Page-Turner: *The Silent Echoes* by Eleanor Vance

This time, I picked up *The Silent Echoes* by Eleanor Vance, a book that falls squarely into the psychological thriller category. Without giving anything away, it's the story of a woman who returns to her childhood home after years away, following a family tragedy. As she tries to make sense of the past and present, she uncovers layers of secrets that make her question everything she thought she knew about her family and herself. It’s a compelling journey into memory, grief, and the unsettling things that can hide beneath a calm surface.

### What Stood Out (The Good Parts!)

What truly impressed me about this book was the way Eleanor Vance handled the characters. The main character felt incredibly real and complex. Her internal struggles, her doubts, and her determination were so well-written that I found myself rooting for her, even when she made choices I didn't quite agree with. The supporting characters also had surprising depth; they weren't just props but felt like fully formed individuals with their own hidden motives.

The writing style was another highlight for me. It's descriptive without being flowery, drawing you right into the atmospheric setting of the old house and the small, insular town. The pacing was absolutely brilliant – it started with a slow, creeping tension, then gradually built up to a heart-pounding climax that had me turning pages late into the night. The emotional journey the protagonist goes through is palpable, making you feel her fear, confusion, and growing sense of unease.

### A Small Quibble (Just Being Honest!)

If I had to pick one minor point, there was a moment in the middle where the protagonist seemed to overlook an obvious clue for just a little too long. It didn't break the story for me, but it made me pause and think, ""Wait, why isn't she seeing this?"" However, this was quickly overshadowed by the compelling narrative, and it ultimately didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the book. It’s a very small thing in an otherwise gripping story.

### Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!

Yes, I wholeheartedly recommend *The Silent Echoes*. If you’re a fan of psychological thrillers, mysteries, or even just stories with strong, complex characters and a rich atmosphere, you’ll likely enjoy this one. It's perfect for anyone who loves a book that keeps them guessing, delving into the human mind, and doesn't shy away from uncomfortable truths. It’s a fantastic pick for a weekend read when you want to get lost in a story.

### A Little Nudge for New Readers!

For those of you who might be new to reading or looking to get back into it, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Don't Be Afraid to Explore:** Pick a genre that sounds interesting. If it doesn't click, try another! There's a whole world of stories out there. If you're like me and enjoy switching things up, maybe one week you're deep into a psychological thriller, and the next you're exploring the wild world of satirical crime like you'd find in [Carl Hiaasen Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/carl-hiaasen-books-in-order/), that's totally fine!
2.  **Give It a Chance:** Try to read the first few chapters before deciding if a book isn't for you. Sometimes it takes a little while for a story to really get going.
3.  **It's Okay to Stop:** If a book truly isn't grabbing you, put it down. Life's too short to read books you don't enjoy! There's no shame in moving on to find something that sparks your interest.
4.  **Find Your Reading Spot:** A comfy chair, a quiet corner, or even a bustling coffee shop – find where you feel most relaxed and able to focus.
5.  **Enjoy the Journey:** Reading should be a pleasure, an escape. Don't feel pressured to read certain types of books or a specific number of books. Just enjoy the ride each story takes you on.

So, whether you're just starting your reading adventure or looking for your next great escape, don't forget there are tons of fantastic stories out there, from thrilling mysteries to the unique humor of authors you can discover more about at [Carl Hiaasen Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/carl-hiaasen-books-in-order/).

I initially got my BFA in Theatre and spent my 20s performing (I loved it), working whatever day job would pay me and let me out by 5. I worked at a tech startup for 4 years, first in the call center, then worked my way up to being a Social Media Moderator, then a Content Writer for a year or so. I didn't love the company but it paid the bills.

There were massive layoffs in 2020, so I worked a variety of jobs--cashier at Trader Joe's, then a barista at a cafe. I liked these jobs well enough but they didn't pay nearly enough. I got a tip about a popular coffee roaster that was hiring, and I was hired as a production team member, working with the roasters/marketing/etc to handle packaging, labeling, loading dock deliveries, etc. I eventually was promoted to Team Lead, and I liked it well enough, though the job was increasingly laborious since the company's demand was growing but they refused to hire more team members. I was laid off from this job this year when I contracted Mononucleosis and had to take a month off of work. I can't prove it was because of the Mono, but I know they were looking to make cutbacks.

I enjoyed learning how to maintain the machines while working at the roasterie, so I decided to start this Electronics Engineering Technology program at a community college; it's a 2ish year Associate's Degree. Part of my decision was also due to the fact that I was still very much recovering from having Mono, and didn't feel like I had the stamina/strength to work a full time job.

Now I'm wondering whether I made the right decision. The classes are fine, if a little boring. I'm learning things, but I don't really know what sort of job I can imagine myself in. I enjoy working with people, and have great communication skills, but I don't know if I could do another customer service job, and I don't feel like I have the credentials for anything else. I understand that any job is going to have it's own stressors, I really just want to earn enough to support myself at a job that I don't absolutely hate!",2,1759521459.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

I was respectful of this but when I tentatively agreed I found out that her brother's new partner was allowed to sleep in the room next door to her sister whilst I was delegated a tent in the garden. I asked if I could sleep in the lounge but was told that her family likes to get up at 6am to have coffee. I asked if she could ask them if they could have it later or if they would be willing to just keep it down so I could sleep through them doing it, even if they were willing to have the coffee in the kitchen instead of the lounge. I even offered to go to bed early and get up early with them but the answer was no, I was then told it was ""not my place"" to ask her family to make changes for me, that it's their house and I should not ask them for favours. I was also then banned from her house by her mother for being rude, dragging her family into it and berating them because of the things I asked for. She thinks this is normal, I do not.

I’m 37F, traveled solo, in decent hiking shape (though I live at sea level and was a little worried about altitude), and had a car.

Accommodations: I stayed at an Airbnb in Three Rivers that is part of a 100-year old “resort.” A family bought it 8 months ago and have been fixing up the cabins ever since. I liked having a kitchen since I was too tired to go out to dinner two of the nights. It was about a 10 minute drive to the park entrance. [https://www.airbnb.com/l/ZASkX4RP](https://www.airbnb.com/l/ZASkX4RP)

Goals: I wanted to drive at least to Cedar Grove (ideally to the end of the road but thunderstorms started moving through so I turned around at Cedar Grove) and then spend one day on a longer hike.

Day 1, Saturday: entered the park around 8am, took a photo by the entrance sign (duh), and then started driving without a definitive plan, pulling over at overlooks whenever I felt like it. I ended up driving to the tunnel tree and then Moro Rock (at 9:30ish, the parking lot was already full, just an FYI, but it was a Saturday). Hiked up to Moro Rock. Stopped at the Lodgepole Visitors Center, got gas at Stony Creek (FYI, the pumps are old and it will take a while), then parked at the Kings Canyon Visitors Center and hiked through Grant Grove. It was a nice little break from the car, but I arrived right around lunchtime so it was busy and there were a lot of tour buses. Spent about 2 hours there then got back in the car for more driving and stopping off at vistas. Made it to Cedar Grove around 3:45 and then turned around for the long drive back. Storms had moved through so I carefully navigated the road in the dimming light and downpours but as I got back into Sequoia NP around sunset, this HUGE rainbow appeared.

Day 2, Sunday (Hiked Giant Forest Museum to General Sherman Tree): I entered the part around 7 (there was a ranger there that early collecting fees and giving directions). Parked at the Giant Forest Museum and set out on a meandering hike to the General Sherman Tree. I started with the Big Trees Trail to warm up, crossed over at the parking lot to the Alta Trail, then took the Hazelwood Cutoff up the Hazelwood Trail to Rimrock Trail. NOTE: the Rimrock trail was impassable about .75 of a mile in - big granite rocks + a stream = slipping. So I turned back around and made my way back to the Alta Trail and took it all the way to Congress Grove. The trail itself was well-maintained, not too rugged, and QUIET. I didn’t see a single person until I got to Congress Grove around the late morning. Hiked to the Sherman Tree, which was crowded around this point. Hiked back to the Giant Forest Museum, got my passport stamp, and went back to the car. Including the backtracking on Rimrock, I did 9.5 miles total, though it would be less without the Rimrock attempt and the Big Trees trail, which imo you can skip if you are looking for something more rugged/technical. 1500’ of elevation gain; the altitude didn’t affect me much, I just kept pounding water and electrolytes.

I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 2],"[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nrc5vt/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/)

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

We would stay with him for a weekend once in a blue moon, and when we were around 10/11 or so, there ended up being a complete cut of contact. He was flaky, didn’t follow up, and was just straight up immature. Other than that, I tried to repair my father and I’s relationship in early high school, and he ended up cancelling plans and I didn’t try to reach out again. We would occasionally see him at family gatherings on his mother’s side (our grandmother), but aside from that I didn’t speak to him or have contact. 

The relationship between me and Jane has almost always been good, despite us not talking for a long time when we were younger. When I reached high school Jane reached out to me and we reconnected, there was family drama between her mother and I which led us being caught in the middle, thus not talking. But we ended up reconnecting, and since high school we’ve been pretty close. As time went on and we’ve both individually reached adulthood, we’ve grown apart a little, as expected. I live about an hour or so away, and Jane was attending college up until a year and a half ago 2 hours away, but I even went to visit her and stay a time or two. We always had good times, and always made time to talk to each other no matter what. Recently however, things felt like they were slowly shifting. Jane and I weren’t talking as much, here and there we would shoot each other a text or call, catch up a little. We weren’t on bad terms, just not as close as we once were. We would try and call each other or set up plans to hang out, but they never ended up set in stone, which wasn’t on either of us to blame which wasn’t either of our faults (like I said, adult life can get busy and it wasn’t like either of us were purposely trying to avoid each other, sometimes plans just don’t happen).

About a month ago, I got an unexpected text from my father. He messaged me saying he wanted to reconnect. Initially, I didn’t even think that I wanted to respond, but I screenshotted it and sent a text to Jane. She immediately told me not to respond to him, which I could see as her trying to protect me in a way, she has her own feelings of him as well so I understood that. I thought about it for a few days, and I ended up responding to him, which I never thought I would do. Growing up without a consistent father figure in my life was difficult, and I have a lot anger and emotions towards him that have been unresolved and without closure. Luckily, growing up my uncle stepped in and was that father figure for me, but still, an absent father is an absent father. I’m not really sure what exactly made me respond to him; I wasn’t doing it out of spite toward Jane or anyone else, I think that at this point in my life I want to try and get closure for the things I can and move on. I’m not in contact with my mother, and I’ve dealt with a lot of hardships and trauma growing up, and making closure for yourself is something that is a long and painful journey, as if being in your twenties isn’t already confusing enough.

So I responded to him, and we talked for a while, and even met up for coffee. We had a long talk and he even ended up crying and pouring his heart out to me about the past, about how he’s messed up, etc. Things so far between my father and I are actually going really well, we’ve met up twice more since then and each time feels less awkward and like we’re talking about a lot of things that matter to me. I’ve been clear from the start- I’m not immediately forgiving him or absolving him of accountability for what he’s done. I still have a lot of anger toward him and unanswered questions, and I don’t know exactly how to move forward with our relationship so we’ve been talking here and there and he’s been open and honest with me as far as I can tell. I wasn’t going into this with a lot of hope; like I said he’s let me down time and time again in the past and I didn’t want to come out of this even more hurt. But slowly I have been hoping, because from the talks we’ve had and the times I’ve seen him he does actually seem to have changed. I met his girlfriend and her kids, and he has told me he’s going to therapy and is really trying to fix the mistakes he’s made in the past. He seems different from what I remember him, in a good way, and the talks we’ve had have really helped me. Maybe that’s just the inner child in me, the little girl who wants her father, but it’s just what I’ve observed. Again, none of this is me saying he’s forgiven, or that I’ve forget about what he’s done in the past. I’m the one setting the pace in which we talk and see each other, and I’m taking baby steps and trying to go slowly and see what I need from this. If he were to ever mess up like he did in the past again, or make me feel like this was going nowhere, I have no problem severing that connection. If something doesn’t add value to my life, I’m not going to be a part of it. 

Now here comes the problem. Jane messaged me a few days after I had met my dad for coffee. After her initial reaction to me showing her my dad had reached out, I wasn’t really wanting to upset her by telling her I was reconnecting with him. I figured I was waiting a bit to see how things were before I had said anything to her. Not that I was purposely planning on leaving her out of it, but Jane has a tendency to be overly negative and make things about her, and I didn’t want to have to deal with that when I was already dealing with how I felt about the whole situation. She messaged me and went off, saying how I was hurting her, and how could I make plans with him when I was avoiding her? She continued by saying that I had blown her off numerous times in the past, and it wasn’t fair that I was giving him time when I wasn’t giving her any. 

I told her that texting/calling is a two way street, because I have also reached out to her in the past and it hasn’t led to anything. Like I’ve stated, I know that adult life is busy and sometimes things get pushed to the side, we’ve both done it and I’ve never felt upset with her about it because I know she’s my sister and she’s not doing it intentionally. She’s talked to me through hard times and vice versa, we’ve always been there for each other. 

Then what really shocked me was she accused him of being inappropriate with her when we were younger, being creepy and even calling him a p*******. This is what really surprised me, because before any of this, she had never told me that once. We had talked about our dad numerous times in the past, and never once was I told about any of this. I personally have never felt that way about our father or had that kind of experience with him, but also being a victim of that kind of thing in my adulthood, I 
would never say that “well it hasn’t happened to me, so it must’ve never happened to her.” I don’t want to invalidate her feelings, or call her a liar because I would never victim blame, but I’m honestly so confused by this. I don’t even know what to do, I feel guilty every time I message my dad, and it’s in the back of my head that I’m really messing up by her with reconnecting with him. 

I’m just truly confused and shocked and not sure if I’m in the wrong here, what’s she’s accusing him of is a huge deal and I don’t want to invalidate that. I don’t think it’s possible she’s told me before and I don’t remember, this is something that I would definitely remember talking about. I apologize for the long read, I just don’t know who to talk to about this. 

UPDATE: i completely forgot to mention. About a year ago, my father had actually reached out to Jane, and she made her own attempt to reconnect with him. He visited her, and she told me that she was using him for money, which is her own business. I didn’t comment on it, because part of me understood, he owes the both of us a lot and if she wanted that from him that was her. She didn’t mention any of what she told me to him at this time as well.

1nx9aj7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nx9aj7,Chicken Shchi with Golden Raisins,"I finally got around to writing up a detailed recipe for my chicken shchi with golden raisins and a bonus recipe for the Russian-style sauerkraut I used.  Recipe in the photos.  First pic is the reheated leftovers I had for lunch.

Recipe notes:

1) I used dried tarragon and dill but I would recommend fresh if you have it, at least for the dill.  I’ve never made it with fresh tarragon and I would say to use French tarragon as Russian tarragon is more bitter, but I’d love to play around with both in the future.  I did top it with fresh dill today because I bought some for a tzatziki I made on Wednesday 

2) I use an air-fryer to prep the chicken before adding it but you could also fry it in the Dutch oven and remove it to rest and cut into chunks while you fry the onions

3) I also want to experiment with using tomato paste instead of tomato sauce (especially Cento double-concentrated) and adding it to the onions and chicken before deglazing, getting a little fry on it.  This was actually my first time adding tomato anything but that’s what my old Russian cookbook called for.

4) This version doesn’t have any potatoes or tubers (because I didn’t have any) but I’d also love to play around with adding root vegetables.  I didn’t miss them but some turnips may really elevate it, who knows.  Maybe next time.

5) I just noticed I didn’t put a quantity next to the kraut — I used the whole 1.3kg batch of kraut I made.  The 1950’s recipe I was working from called for equal weights of meat and cabbage but I did me and you can do you.

The cuffs clicked around my wrists. Cold, too tight. They didn’t even bother with John—he was hauled off limp, half-conscious, his bloodied arm wrapped in an old rag. I remember the way it dripped onto the floorboards of the café as they dragged him out, leaving streaks and spatters like some grotesque trail leading back to the window we’d broken in through.

Vince and I didn’t resist. We just followed, silent, our shoes crunching on glass and dirt as Sheriff Callahan’s cronies led us out into the fog. The night air slapped me clean after the suffocating rot inside the café, but it didn’t matter—I could still smell blood. I could still smell salt, too, thick and heavy though the ocean was half a mile away.

They shoved us into the back of a cruiser. The ride to the station wasn’t long. Blackwood wasn’t big enough for any ride to be long. Still, those minutes stretched endlessly. Vince stared at his knees, chewing the inside of his cheek the way he did when he was scared but didn’t want to admit it. I just kept seeing John’s face, slack-jawed and black-eyed, mouthing words that didn’t belong to him. My stomach turned over.

The station sat squat across from the diner, a square brick box with a flagpole out front and a single yellow light burning above the double doors. The light hummed, spitting moths against the glass.

Inside, the air was thick with coffee and cigarettes. The linoleum was cracked, the kind of checkerboard that might’ve been white and green once but had long since faded to piss-yellow and sickly gray. The deputies moved slowly, tired, like this was all routine, just another Friday night scraping kids off the street.

Then Callahan walked in.

The sheriff was a broad man, not tall, but built like he’d been carved out of oak. His hair was iron-gray, buzzed short, his mustache thick and stern. He wore his badge like it was part of his body, gleaming on his chest. His eyes—cold, pale blue—swept over Vince and me like we were nothing worth the effort of looking at.

He planted himself across the desk from us, leaned forward, and folded his hands. The wood creaked under his weight.

“Well,” he said, voice gravelly, steady. “You two sure stirred up some trouble tonight.”

“Sheriff, it wasn’t—” I started.

“Quiet.” He didn’t raise his voice. Didn’t need to. The word landed like a slap. “I don’t want excuses. I want the truth.”

Vince glanced at me. I swallowed. My throat felt raw.

“We weren’t—” I tried again, softer. “It was John. He—he went off. He was cutting himself. We didn’t do anything—”

Callahan’s stare drilled into me, unblinking. “You break into city property?”

I hesitated. My silence was enough.

“You drink inside?”

Another silence.

He sighed, leaned back in his chair, and pinched the bridge of his nose. For a moment, I thought I saw something almost human in him—tiredness, disappointment, maybe even pity. But then it was gone, shuttered away.

“Let me tell you something, son,” he said. “When I was your age, boys got their thrills chopping wood or throwing rocks at tin cans. Not breaking into condemned buildings and desecrating themselves like… that.”

“It wasn’t us,” Vince said quickly, his voice tight. “Sheriff, I swear to God. John just—he wasn’t himself. He was saying things—”

Callahan’s head snapped toward him. “You listen good, Vincent. You keep the Lord’s name out of your mouth unless you’re in church. Understand?”

Vince nodded, his jaw tight.

The sheriff studied us both for a long moment. Then he rose, his chair groaning behind him. He paced to the holding cell, where they’d stashed John. I craned my neck. Through the bars, I could see John slumped on the cot, his head bowed, his arm wrapped in bandages. His lips still moved, whispering, even in sleep—or whatever state he was in.

Callahan turned back. “You two are lucky you’re not the ones bleeding out right now.”

“We didn’t—” I tried again. My voice cracked. “Sheriff, I swear, we didn’t make him do it. He just… snapped.”

For the first time, Callahan’s face softened, but it wasn’t kindness. It was that same look my father gave me when I lied about a broken window: not fooled, not angry—just weary.

“Boys don’t just snap,” he said flatly. “Not unless something puts them up to it. And between the liquor, the trespassing, and the company you keep…” His gaze flicked to me, sharp, accusatory. “…I’d say there’s plenty to answer for.”

He motioned to one of his deputies. “Call the fathers.”

The words sank into me like stones. My stomach knotted. Vince’s face went pale.

I thought about my old man, sitting at the kitchen table, a cigarette glowing in the dark, waiting for the phone to ring.

I thought about the sound his belt made when he slid it through the loops.

The deputy picked up the phone without looking at us, his fingers yellow from nicotine, dialing like he’d done it a thousand times. The sound of each click on the rotary was a countdown. I could already see my father’s face, already feel the shadow of his hand.

Callahan stayed by the desk, arms folded, his pale eyes steady as a nail. Vince stared straight ahead at the wall, jaw clenched. His knee kept bouncing, faster and faster, until Callahan’s gaze snapped to him. Vince froze.

The sheriff didn’t need to shout to fill a room. His voice was low, but it carried like weight. “I told you boys years ago to stay out of that place. Now one of your friends is damn near cut to ribbons and you’re sitting in my station stinking of warm beer like gutter rats.” He leaned closer, elbows on his knees, his stare flicking between me and Vince. “Do you know how this looks?”

“We didn’t make him do it,” I said, but it came out weak.

Callahan’s mouth curled—not a smile, but something that wanted to be. “That’s not what I asked.”

The deputy hung up the phone. “Hank’s on his way,” he muttered.

My heart dropped at the name. Hank. My father.

The sheriff’s expression didn’t change. “Good,” he said. “We’ll let him sort you out.” He straightened, dusting invisible crumbs from his hands. “You boys sit tight. You’re not under arrest. Yet. But you’re not walking out either.”

He turned toward the holding cell. John was still slumped on the cot, his head bowed, lips moving. He looked like a scarecrow left in a field too long—skin gray, blood seeping through the bandage on his arm. His whispering was low, broken, but constant. I couldn’t make out words. Not really. Just sounds. Wet, dragging sounds, like someone trying to speak through water.

“Jesus,” one of the deputies muttered, staring.

“Don’t blaspheme,” Callahan snapped without looking back.

I tore my eyes from John and fixed them on the linoleum. The checkerboard squares were worn smooth where a hundred boots had scuffed them, and each green square faded to a sickly brown. Cigarette burns peppered the floor like little craters. This was the kind of place where kids got dragged for curfew violations, shoplifting, and bar fights. Not whatever this was.

The door banged open.

My father filled the frame.

He wasn’t a big man, not the way Callahan was, but he had a way of taking up a room all the same. Shoulders hunched forward like he’d been bent over a boat his whole life, face lined deep from salt and wind. His shirt was stained, his hands still smelling of diesel and bait. The stink of whiskey hit before his voice.

“What’d he do?” he asked the room, not me.

Callahan stepped forward. “Trespassing. Drinking. He and Vincent were with John Greeley when it happened.”

My father’s head turned slowly, eyes narrowing at me. “What happened?”

Callahan didn’t answer. He just stepped aside so my father could see the cell. John sat there, still whispering, blood dark on the bandage.

For a moment, my father didn’t move. He just stared. Then he exhaled through his nose, long and slow, and turned his eyes on me again.

“You do this?” he asked. His voice wasn’t loud, but it cut sharper than shouting.

“No,” I said quickly. “We didn’t touch him. He came in like that. We tried to stop him.”

“You tried,” he said. “But you still went in there. You still drank.”

“I—” My mouth went dry.

He took two steps forward, close enough that I could smell the ocean on him, the stale liquor. His eyes were bloodshot, dark as wet stone. “You got any idea what kind of fool you made me look like tonight?”

I kept my eyes on the floor. “We didn’t—”

“Look at me.”

I forced my head up. His stare was cold, steady, a net thrown over me.

“You want to act like a man?” he said. “Then you get treated like one.”

Callahan’s voice cut in. “Easy, Hank.”

My father didn’t take his eyes off me. “You keep your station, Sheriff,” he said, his tone polite but flat. “This one’s mine.”

Callahan stepped closer, his boots scraping the tile. “While he’s under my roof, he’s mine. Don’t forget that.”

They stood like that for a heartbeat—Callahan with his hands on his belt, my father with his fists at his sides. Two men built from the same hard stuff, just wearing different uniforms.

Finally, my father exhaled through his nose again. “Fine,” he said. “Let’s go.”

Callahan gestured at the cuffs. One of the deputies stepped forward and unlocked them, the metal biting my wrists as it came off. My hands tingled as the blood returned.

“Thank the sheriff,” my father said.

I muttered, “Thank you,” without looking up.

Callahan didn’t answer. He was already staring back at John, his brow furrowed, like he was trying to puzzle something out.

My father grabbed my arm, not gently, and steered me toward the door. Vince looked at me, eyes wide, but didn’t say a word.

We stepped outside.

The night was thick with fog. The ocean’s roar was distant but steady, the air wet and cold. My father’s grip dug into my arm as he pulled me toward the truck parked under the yellow streetlight. Neither of us spoke.

My stomach churned. My wrists burned where the cuffs had been. John’s blood, John’s whispering, the shapes he carved—they all followed me out into the night.

When my father shoved me into the truck and slammed the door, I realized my hands were still shaking.

He climbed in beside me, the cab reeking of salt, oil, and whiskey. He started the engine, the old motor coughing, and for a long moment we just sat there, the headlights cutting pale beams through the fog.

Then, without looking at me, he said, “You’re gonna tell me exactly what the hell happened in there.”

His voice was low, almost calm, but I knew that tone. That was the tone he used before the belt.

I stared out the window at the moths circling the streetlight and tried to swallow the taste of salt in my mouth.

The truck rumbled out of the lot, the headlights catching the fog like smoke. Blackwood’s streets were near empty at this hour—just a few scattered lamps, yellow pools in the gray, and the occasional shape of a house with its porch light burning. The engine’s groan filled the silence between us. I sat stiff in the passenger seat, my hands in my lap, fingers digging into each other.

“You break into that café.” His voice came flat, like he was reciting facts. Not a question.

“Yes, sir.”

“You drank.”

“Yes, sir.”

He nodded once, eyes never leaving the road. The wheel squeaked when he turned it, his calloused hand wrapped tight.

“And John cut himself up in front of you.”

“Yes, sir.”

The words sounded pitiful in my own mouth. Too clean for what had happened. Like I was reporting to school instead of trying to explain why my friend was lying in a cell, whispering like something hollowed him out.

My father sucked on his teeth. The smell of whiskey came off him strong in the cab’s heat. “You ever think maybe you’re not as clever as you think? You go where you’re told not to, you drink what you’re told not to, and now the whole damn town’s gonna be talking about it. About you. About me.”

“I didn’t—”

“Don’t.” His hand tightened on the wheel. “Don’t try to lie pretty. I can smell it on you.”

We passed the diner. The neon sign hummed and sputtered in the fog, half the letters dead, so it only read *DI\_\_*. A couple of drunks stood outside smoking, their faces pale in the glow. They watched the truck crawl past like buzzards.

“Boy like John,” my father said after a long silence, “he’s a crack in the wall. You can see it coming years before it breaks. You don’t go standing under it, waiting for it to fall on you. You hear me?”

“Yes, sir.”

But my mind wasn’t on John. It was back in that café, on the way, the cuts on his arm had glistened in the dim light, too sharp and deliberate to be random. It was on the sound of his whispering, still carrying even when his eyes had rolled back.

“You’re gonna keep your damn distance from him,” my father said, voice lowering. “You and Vince both. That boy’s a rot. And rot spreads.”

I nodded, though I knew Vince would never let go of John, not really. Vince had that stubborn hope about him, the kind that thought you could drag someone out of the water even if they were already gone under.

The truck climbed the hill out of town, the ocean on one side, the woods on the other. The trees looked wrong in the fog—taller, darker, pressed in close like they were leaning over the road to watch us pass. Every so often, the headlights caught their trunks, pale and slick, like bones standing upright.

My father cracked his window, flicked his cigarette butt out, and lit another. The flare of the lighter briefly lit the lines on his face, carved deep like someone had etched them in salt and anger.

“You’re lucky,” he said finally. “Lucky Callahan didn’t keep you. He’s a mean son of a bitch, but fair. If it were up to me, I’d have left you in that cell overnight. Let you listen to your friend mutter himself hoarse.”

I didn’t answer. My tongue felt thick, as if I spoke the words might twist wrong in the air.

The truck crested the hill, and through the fog I could just barely see the lighthouse out on the point. Its beam cut slow arcs through the night, pale and tired. For a moment, I thought I saw the light catch on something else—something darker, taller than the trees—but then it passed, and there was only fog again.

My father downshifted, the gears grinding. “When we get home,” he said, “you go straight to your room. Tomorrow, you work the nets at dawn. No friends, no excuses. You need reminding of what keeps a man straight, I’ll remind you.”

“Yes, sir,” I muttered.

The words tasted like rust.

The truck rattled down toward the coast road, and I kept my eyes on the lighthouse beam. I told myself it was only the fog, only the tricks of a tired mind. But the longer I watched, the more I felt like something in that café had followed us out. Something sitting just past the reach of the light, waiting.

And though I didn’t dare say it, I was starting to wonder if John hadn’t been the only one whispering that night.",1,1759521056.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

Callahan’s head snapped toward him. “You listen good, Vincent. You keep the Lord’s name out of your mouth unless you’re in church. Understand?”

Vince nodded, his jaw tight.

The sheriff studied us both for a long moment. Then he rose, his chair groaning behind him. He paced to the holding cell, where they’d stashed John. I craned my neck. Through the bars, I could see John slumped on the cot, his head bowed, his arm wrapped in bandages. His lips still moved, whispering, even in sleep—or whatever state he was in.

Callahan turned back. “You two are lucky you’re not the ones bleeding out right now.”

“We didn’t—” I tried again. My voice cracked. “Sheriff, I swear, we didn’t make him do it. He just… snapped.”

For the first time, Callahan’s face softened, but it wasn’t kindness. It was that same look my father gave me when I lied about a broken window: not fooled, not angry—just weary.

“Boys don’t just snap,” he said flatly. “Not unless something puts them up to it. And between the liquor, the trespassing, and the company you keep…” His gaze flicked to me, sharp, accusatory. “…I’d say there’s plenty to answer for.”

He motioned to one of his deputies. “Call the fathers.”

The words sank into me like stones. My stomach knotted. Vince’s face went pale.

I thought about my old man, sitting at the kitchen table, a cigarette glowing in the dark, waiting for the phone to ring.

I thought about the sound his belt made when he slid it through the loops.

The deputy picked up the phone without looking at us, his fingers yellow from nicotine, dialing like he’d done it a thousand times. The sound of each click on the rotary was a countdown. I could already see my father’s face, already feel the shadow of his hand.

Callahan stayed by the desk, arms folded, his pale eyes steady as a nail. Vince stared straight ahead at the wall, jaw clenched. His knee kept bouncing, faster and faster, until Callahan’s gaze snapped to him. Vince froze.

The sheriff didn’t need to shout to fill a room. His voice was low, but it carried like weight. “I told you boys years ago to stay out of that place. Now one of your friends is damn near cut to ribbons and you’re sitting in my station stinking of warm beer like gutter rats.” He leaned closer, elbows on his knees, his stare flicking between me and Vince. “Do you know how this looks?”

“We didn’t make him do it,” I said, but it came out weak.

Callahan’s mouth curled—not a smile, but something that wanted to be. “That’s not what I asked.”

The deputy hung up the phone. “Hank’s on his way,” he muttered.

My heart dropped at the name. Hank. My father.

The sheriff’s expression didn’t change. “Good,” he said. “We’ll let him sort you out.” He straightened, dusting invisible crumbs from his hands. “You boys sit tight. You’re not under arrest. Yet. But you’re not walking out either.”

He turned toward the holding cell. John was still slumped on the cot, his head bowed, lips moving. He looked like a scarecrow left in a field too long—skin gray, blood seeping through the bandage on his arm. His whispering was low, broken, but constant. I couldn’t make out words. Not really. Just sounds. Wet, dragging sounds, like someone trying to speak through water.

“Jesus,” one of the deputies muttered, staring.

“Don’t blaspheme,” Callahan snapped without looking back.

I tore my eyes from John and fixed them on the linoleum. The checkerboard squares were worn smooth where a hundred boots had scuffed them, and each green square faded to a sickly brown. Cigarette burns peppered the floor like little craters. This was the kind of place where kids got dragged for curfew violations, shoplifting, and bar fights. Not whatever this was.

The door banged open.

My father filled the frame.

He wasn’t a big man, not the way Callahan was, but he had a way of taking up a room all the same. Shoulders hunched forward like he’d been bent over a boat his whole life, face lined deep from salt and wind. His shirt was stained, his hands still smelling of diesel and bait. The stink of whiskey hit before his voice.

“What’d he do?” he asked the room, not me.

Callahan stepped forward. “Trespassing. Drinking. He and Vincent were with John Greeley when it happened.”

My father’s head turned slowly, eyes narrowing at me. “What happened?”

Callahan didn’t answer. He just stepped aside so my father could see the cell. John sat there, still whispering, blood dark on the bandage.

For a moment, my father didn’t move. He just stared. Then he exhaled through his nose, long and slow, and turned his eyes on me again.

“You do this?” he asked. His voice wasn’t loud, but it cut sharper than shouting.

“No,” I said quickly. “We didn’t touch him. He came in like that. We tried to stop him.”

“You tried,” he said. “But you still went in there. You still drank.”

“I—” My mouth went dry.

He took two steps forward, close enough that I could smell the ocean on him, the stale liquor. His eyes were bloodshot, dark as wet stone. “You got any idea what kind of fool you made me look like tonight?”

I kept my eyes on the floor. “We didn’t—”

“Look at me.”

I forced my head up. His stare was cold, steady, a net thrown over me.

“You want to act like a man?” he said. “Then you get treated like one.”

Callahan’s voice cut in. “Easy, Hank.”

My father didn’t take his eyes off me. “You keep your station, Sheriff,” he said, his tone polite but flat. “This one’s mine.”

Callahan stepped closer, his boots scraping the tile. “While he’s under my roof, he’s mine. Don’t forget that.”

They stood like that for a heartbeat—Callahan with his hands on his belt, my father with his fists at his sides. Two men built from the same hard stuff, just wearing different uniforms.

Finally, my father exhaled through his nose again. “Fine,” he said. “Let’s go.”

Callahan gestured at the cuffs. One of the deputies stepped forward and unlocked them, the metal biting my wrists as it came off. My hands tingled as the blood returned.

“Thank the sheriff,” my father said.

I muttered, “Thank you,” without looking up.

Callahan didn’t answer. He was already staring back at John, his brow furrowed, like he was trying to puzzle something out.

My father grabbed my arm, not gently, and steered me toward the door. Vince looked at me, eyes wide, but didn’t say a word.

We stepped outside.

The night was thick with fog. The ocean’s roar was distant but steady, the air wet and cold. My father’s grip dug into my arm as he pulled me toward the truck parked under the yellow streetlight. Neither of us spoke.

My stomach churned. My wrists burned where the cuffs had been. John’s blood, John’s whispering, the shapes he carved—they all followed me out into the night.

When my father shoved me into the truck and slammed the door, I realized my hands were still shaking.

He climbed in beside me, the cab reeking of salt, oil, and whiskey. He started the engine, the old motor coughing, and for a long moment we just sat there, the headlights cutting pale beams through the fog.

Then, without looking at me, he said, “You’re gonna tell me exactly what the hell happened in there.”

His voice was low, almost calm, but I knew that tone. That was the tone he used before the belt.

I stared out the window at the moths circling the streetlight and tried to swallow the taste of salt in my mouth.

The truck rumbled out of the lot, the headlights catching the fog like smoke. Blackwood’s streets were near empty at this hour—just a few scattered lamps, yellow pools in the gray, and the occasional shape of a house with its porch light burning. The engine’s groan filled the silence between us. I sat stiff in the passenger seat, my hands in my lap, fingers digging into each other.

“You break into that café.” His voice came flat, like he was reciting facts. Not a question.

“Yes, sir.”

“You drank.”

“Yes, sir.”

He nodded once, eyes never leaving the road. The wheel squeaked when he turned it, his calloused hand wrapped tight.

“And John cut himself up in front of you.”

“Yes, sir.”

The words sounded pitiful in my own mouth. Too clean for what had happened. Like I was reporting to school instead of trying to explain why my friend was lying in a cell, whispering like something hollowed him out.

My father sucked on his teeth. The smell of whiskey came off him strong in the cab’s heat. “You ever think maybe you’re not as clever as you think? You go where you’re told not to, you drink what you’re told not to, and now the whole damn town’s gonna be talking about it. About you. About me.”

“I didn’t—”

“Don’t.” His hand tightened on the wheel. “Don’t try to lie pretty. I can smell it on you.”

We passed the diner. The neon sign hummed and sputtered in the fog, half the letters dead, so it only read *DI\_\_*. A couple of drunks stood outside smoking, their faces pale in the glow. They watched the truck crawl past like buzzards.

“Boy like John,” my father said after a long silence, “he’s a crack in the wall. You can see it coming years before it breaks. You don’t go standing under it, waiting for it to fall on you. You hear me?”

“Yes, sir.”

But my mind wasn’t on John. It was back in that café, on the way, the cuts on his arm had glistened in the dim light, too sharp and deliberate to be random. It was on the sound of his whispering, still carrying even when his eyes had rolled back.

“You’re gonna keep your damn distance from him,” my father said, voice lowering. “You and Vince both. That boy’s a rot. And rot spreads.”

I nodded, though I knew Vince would never let go of John, not really. Vince had that stubborn hope about him, the kind that thought you could drag someone out of the water even if they were already gone under.

The truck climbed the hill out of town, the ocean on one side, the woods on the other. The trees looked wrong in the fog—taller, darker, pressed in close like they were leaning over the road to watch us pass. Every so often, the headlights caught their trunks, pale and slick, like bones standing upright.

My father cracked his window, flicked his cigarette butt out, and lit another. The flare of the lighter briefly lit the lines on his face, carved deep like someone had etched them in salt and anger.

“You’re lucky,” he said finally. “Lucky Callahan didn’t keep you. He’s a mean son of a bitch, but fair. If it were up to me, I’d have left you in that cell overnight. Let you listen to your friend mutter himself hoarse.”

I didn’t answer. My tongue felt thick, as if I spoke the words might twist wrong in the air.

The truck crested the hill, and through the fog I could just barely see the lighthouse out on the point. Its beam cut slow arcs through the night, pale and tired. For a moment, I thought I saw the light catch on something else—something darker, taller than the trees—but then it passed, and there was only fog again.

My father downshifted, the gears grinding. “When we get home,” he said, “you go straight to your room. Tomorrow, you work the nets at dawn. No friends, no excuses. You need reminding of what keeps a man straight, I’ll remind you.”

“Yes, sir,” I muttered.

The words tasted like rust.

The truck rattled down toward the coast road, and I kept my eyes on the lighthouse beam. I told myself it was only the fog, only the tricks of a tired mind. But the longer I watched, the more I felt like something in that café had followed us out. Something sitting just past the reach of the light, waiting.

And though I didn’t dare say it, I was starting to wonder if John hadn’t been the only one whispering that night.",2,1759521010.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1nx97de,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1nx97de/i_want_to_share_some_tips_now_that_im_2_weeks/,I want to share some tips now that I'm 2 weeks post-op,"Two weeks ago I had a laproscopic surgery for a small hiatal hernia and a Dor fundoplication. Now that I've had some time to adjust, I wanted to share some things that I've found helpful. I'm adding the caveat that you should always consult with your medical team, and I'm not a medical professional.

***Before the Surgery***

* **Create a Med Sheet.** I found it helpful to create a med sheet that I kept on my fridge to track all the different meds I was taking. I made my own on Google Docs, but there are a lot of templates online that you can use. This was also helpful for the people in my life who were supporting me right after surgery.
* **Make Sure All Your Old Meds Are Crushable.** There's a potential for some pills (especially larger ones) to get stuck when they go down, which will make your surgery site swell up. When that happens, my med team told me I had to switch back to a thin liquid diet (e.g., broth) for 24 hours until the swelling goes down. So it's worth it to take the extra time to get your meds sorted. Most of my meds could be crushed, but there were a few that weren't. Insurance wouldn't cover it at first, but my psychiatrist was able to submit documentation that it was medically necessary due to my inability to swallow.
* **Meal Prep.** My personal staples have been blended soups, protein drinks, smoothie bowls, and lots of ice cream. Make stuff you're excited to eat, and try to make a variety of options if you can. For me, I mentally tried to get excited for soup season and picked two bisques I was excited to try. In hindsight, I wish I made more varieties of soup because I got bored pretty quickly. I also invested in a silicone soup mold so I could freeze and heat up the soups more easily.
   * *Add extra protein where you can.* Protein is going to help you feel satisfied and prevent muscle atrophy. Personally, I kinda hate protein drinks so I wanted more variety. What I ended up doing was adding nutritional yeast (\~10-15g protein per 100g) and silken tofu (\~8g protein per 100g) to my soups. I'm vegetarian, so I have these things on hand already, and I get that these might gross some people out. Nutritional yeast has a kinda cheesy umami taste that I find pleasant. Silken tofu is literally tasteless, and when you blend it up it becomes a cream that is really easy to mix into anything.
* **Beverage Prep.** This is the time to go all out with fun beverages! You don't need to stick with coffee, broth, water, juice, protein drinks, and soup. Get those fancy (non-carbonated and non-alcoholic) drinks you always look at. Personally I've been enjoying a lot of matcha lemonades, those creamy frappuccino drinks, and other random boujee drinks that I force myself to ignore while grocery shopping.
* **Prep Your Living Space.** With the lifting restriction, make sure that heavy things that you might need are within reach. Also make your living space more accessible where you can. For example, I have a one-year-old who I take care of during the day, and I'm not able to carry her or lift her into her crib. So we ended up unassembling our bedframe so when I'm home alone, she can nap on our bed without me having to pick her up.

***After the Surgery***

* **Take the Diet and Lifting Restrictions Seriously.** I messed up a few times, and it really sucks. It hurts when food gets stuck, and on top of that, it was really demoralizing to have to switch back to a thinner liquid diet every time something got stuck. There was also a time when I lifted my daughter when I wasn't supposed to, and I definitely felt something pull in my diaphragm. I was achey for days afterward. The restrictions are there for a reason.
* **Ask for Help.** From your medical team, from your friends, from your family. Your medical team is there to help you problem-solve and answer questions. Utilize them! And your friends and family probably want to help you too. For me, the biggest help was childcare and food/beverages. Seriously, eating any soup that I didn't make myself felt like such a huge mood booster.
* **Use Your Stool Softeners and Such (If Recommended by Your Med Team).** Narcotics are going to back you up (ouch), and straining isn't good for your surgery site.
* **Take Care of Your Mental Health.** This part I do feel qualified to speak on, seeing as I'm a licensed therapist lol. But emotionally it's really taxing to heal from surgery, to be hungry, to need to ask for help all the time, and to be limited in what you can do in general. At the very least, try to make sure that you're getting enough sleep, taking your medications, and eating/drinking what you can. Those things are going to make the biggest difference. Beyond that, I've found it helpful to go outside (even if it's just standing on the porch), be cozy (e.g., wear soft things, light nice candles, snuggle with my kid), and spend time with people who make me feel like myself. That being said, I've had some hard days, which I think should be expected. Try not to be too hard on yourself.

That's all I can think of right now. Let me know if you have any questions :) I hope this was helpful for someone",1,1759520885.0,HiatalHernia,0,1.0,False

Honey, You Are FIRED!","To test my husband's work abilities, Dad arranged for me to conduct a surprise inspection of the company he manages.  
The moment I walked in, some blonde bimbo in a barely-there dress was staring at the industrial paper shredder like she'd discovered fire.

...  
  
  
Dad sent me to the company to evaluate Jaxon.  
  
  
He said it was routine inspection, told me not to stress about it—just think of it as getting familiar with the business early.  
  
  
I figured it was just going through the motions.  
  
  
So I told the receptionist I was an auditor from corporate, and she respectfully swiped me through with her keycard.  
  
  
But the second I entered the office area, I spotted this woman.  
  
  
She was dressed super innocent—white sundress from Target and everything—crouched in front of the paper shredder, looking totally fascinated.  
  
  
""OMG, this machine is like, totally insane. Can it literally shred anything?""  
  
  
Without thinking, she grabbed a document from the desk next to her.  
  
  
The cover was stamped in red letters: ""MERGER CONTRACT.""  
  
  
She didn't even hesitate—just started shoving the contract toward the shredder.  
  
  
A guy with glasses nearby went absolutely pale.  
  
  
He basically threw himself at her, nearly tackling her to snatch the contract away.  
  
  
""Holy shit, Wren! Weren't you supposed to be gaming in the office?""  
  
  
His voice was shaking with terror.  
  
  
""What are you doing out here? This contract goes to print this afternoon!""  
  
  
The woman got bumped by him but wasn't mad at all—just giggled and waved her empty Dunkin' cup around.  
  
  
""Gaming got boring. I'm literally dying of thirst.""  
  
  
The coworker let out a relieved breath, clutching that contract like his life depended on it.  
  
  
He lowered his voice, practically begging:  
  
  
""Then please, go grab some water and drink it back in the office, okay? Doesn't Jaxon's office have its own Keurig?""  
  
  
The woman pouted.  
  
  
""That coffee tastes nasty. I want some of that good stuff from the break room.""  
  
  
She totally ignored his about-to-cry expression and headed toward the kitchenette.  
  
  
Watching this whole trainwreck, my temples were pounding.  
  
  
I grabbed a young-looking intern nearby.  
  
  
""Who is she?""  
  
  
The intern glanced at me, then quickly looked back at the woman's retreating figure, eyes full of dread.  
  
  
He put his finger to his lips.  
  
  
""Shh, keep it down.""  
  
  
He leaned close to my ear, voice barely a whisper.  
  
  
""That's our boss Jaxon's wife, Wren.""  
  
  
My heart dropped, and suddenly all of Jaxon's weird behavior lately made perfect sense.  
  
  
The intern kept talking.  
  
  
""Word is she actually owns this company, so she's like, the real queen bee around here.""  
  
  
""You just start? You'll get used to it.""  
  
  
He sighed, his face showing the kind of bone-deep exhaustion that only comes from being put through hell.  
  
  
""Usually she just hangs in Jaxon's corner office, gaming and binge-watching Netflix. Doesn't really mess with us.""  
  
  
""Jaxon must be out at client meetings today, so nobody's babysitting her. That's why she's out here wrecking everything.""  
  
  
Listening to him, my head was buzzing.  
  
  
She's the boss's wife.  
  
  
Then what the hell am I?  
  
  
The intern noticed my expression and looked concerned.  
  
  
""You good? You look kinda rough.""  
  
  
I shook my head and forced a smile:  
  
  
""I'm fine, just... wow.""  
  
  
""Can't believe the company has people like that. Real eye-opener.""  
  
  
The intern shrugged with a bitter laugh.  
  
  
""You get used to it. At least she doesn't actually do anything major. We all just deal and pray she gets bored and goes back to her office.""  
  
  
I stayed quiet.  
  
  
Doesn't do anything major?  
  
  
That contract she almost shredded? That would've tanked a billion-dollar deal.  
  
  
Who's gonna eat those losses?  
  
  
I watched Wren bounce out of the kitchenette, literally skipping and humming some Taylor Swift song.  
  
  
I pulled out my phone, about to call Dad.  
  
  
But then I thought better of it and put it away.  
  
  
Just leaving now would let Jaxon off way too easy.  
  
  
Dad sent me here to evaluate his abilities.  
  
  
Looks like his abilities AND his character are completely fucked.  
  
  
I wanted to see just how far this company had gone down the drain under his management.  
  
  
I straightened my blazer and walked to reception.  
  
  
""Hi, I'm Brielle from corporate, here for project auditing.""  
  
  
""Could you set me up with a temporary workstation? Somewhere quiet would be perfect.""  
  
  
""Also, today's inspection is confidential—I'd prefer Mr. Jaxon doesn't know I was here.""  
  
  
The receptionist nodded respectfully.  
  
  
I found a corner desk and sat down, keeping an eye on Wren from across the room.  
  
  
She was studying the fire alarm with her fresh Starbucks, looking like she was seriously considering whether to yank that thing.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Jaxon was MIA all morning.  
  
  
Wren must've gotten bored gaming in the executive suite.  
  
  
She wandered back out like she owned the place.  
  
  
First she'd mess with someone's design mockups they'd been working on all morning.  
  
  
Then she'd randomly hit keys on people's computers, screwing up their spreadsheets.  
  
  
Everyone was pissed but couldn't say shit—they'd just freeze when she got close, then frantically fix whatever she broke after she moved on.  
  
  
Then she drifted over to the water cooler.  
  
  
Probably thirsty again, she grabbed a paper cup to fill up.  
  
  
Whether she's just clumsy AF or doing it on purpose, I couldn't tell.  
  
  
Her hand jerked.  
  
  
A full cup of water went flying in a perfect arc, splashing all over the wall next to the cooler.  
  
  
Right where the main electrical panel was.  
  
  
There was this loud ""POP!"" with sparks shooting everywhere.  
  
  
Every light in the office died.  
  
  
All the computer monitors went black at once.  
  
  
A few seconds later, the whole place erupted with screams and ""WHAT THE FUCK!""  
  
  
""My code! I've been coding all morning! It's not saved!""  
  
  
""My Photoshop files! The client's been blowing up my phone and I was almost done!""  
  
  
""My quarterly reports! They're due at 2! I'm so screwed!""  
  
  
The IT manager came flying out of his office.  
  
  
He saw Wren standing there looking all innocent after causing this disaster, and his face went dark.  
  
  
His mouth opened and closed, fists clenched, but he swallowed whatever he was about to say.  
  
  
Wren actually spoke first, voice all whiny and victimized.  
  
  
""Ugh, what's happening?""  
  
  
""This electrical stuff is like, total garbage. A tiny bit of water and it breaks? Why does our company buy such cheap crap?""  
  
  
The nerve of this chick blaming everyone else was honestly next level.  
  
  
The facilities manager came rushing over.  
  
  
He looked at the smoking, fried electrical panel, then at Wren.  
  
  
Immediately switched to this pathetic ass-kissing mode.  
  
  
""Wren, you're not hurt, are you? Did the sparks scare you?""  
  
  
""This totally isn't your fault—the wiring's probably old. We'll get it fixed ASAP, install a new waterproof system!""  
  
  
""You go chill in the office, we'll handle all this.""  
  
  
Wren pouted, looking unsatisfied, but didn't push it. She headed back to Jaxon's corner office.  
  
  
The facilities guy finally wiped the sweat off his forehead and started barking orders at IT.  
  
  
When he walked past my temporary desk, I stopped him.  
  
  
""Does this kind of thing happen a lot?""  
  
  
The manager looked at me, recognized I was from corporate, and his expression went bitter.  
  
  
He pulled me into the stairwell and lowered his voice.  
  
  
""You're the auditor, right? I probably shouldn't be running my mouth, but after today...""  
  
  
He sighed heavily.  
  
  
""Real talk, she's Jaxon's princess. We can't touch her.""  
  
  
""Today Jaxon's in Chicago for client meetings, so nobody can babysit her.""  
  
  
""When Jaxon's around, at least he keeps her locked in his office playing mobile games...""  
  
  
His face showed pure defeat.  
  
  
""Last month, she had another 'oopsie'—knocked over her Frappuccino.""  
  
  
""It went straight into our main server.""  
  
  
""All our data got corrupted. IT pulled all-nighters for a week trying to recover everything. A whole week of everyone's work, completely trashed!""  
  
  
""What happened then?"" I asked.  
  
  
""Jaxon blamed IT for 'inadequate safety protocols' and docked everyone's quarterly bonuses.""  
  
  
""Said it would 'teach us responsibility.'""  
  
  
My stomach kept dropping.  
  
  
So, this is Jaxon's leadership style?  
  
  
Let some airhead wreck the company while hardworking people pay for her stupidity.  
  
  
Jaxon, you're really something special.  
  
  
Just then, the executive office door opened.  
  
  
Wren poked her head out and called to the dark office.  
  
  
""Ugh, I'm so bored! When's the WiFi coming back?... Oh no! My phone's at like 10%!... Are there any snacks in the break room?""  
  
  
Nobody answered.  
  
  
The entire office was dead silent, thick with frustration.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
IT had just gotten everything back online when Dad called.  
  
  
He needed me to pull some sensitive marketing data.  
  
  
Said the files were needed for this afternoon's board meeting at our Manhattan headquarters, and I had to handle it personally—zero margin for error.  
  
  
I grabbed a USB drive, downloaded the data from the marketing director's computer, and headed to the copy room.  
  
  
I'd just finished printing everything and was organizing it with binder clips when the copy room door swung open.  
  
  
Wren bounced in with a bubble tea from the place downstairs.  
  
  
Hell, she immediately spotted the heavy-duty stapler next to me and her eyes lit up.  
  
  
""Ooh, lemme borrow that real quick—my Hot Cheetos bag totally ripped.""  
  
  
She reached over like it was hers.  
  
  
I instinctively pulled the confidential documents and stapler away from her grabby hands.  
  
  
These files contained seriously classified intel.  
  
  
She whiffed completely, stumbled forward from the momentum, and tripped over the printer cord.  
  
  
Her boba tea went airborne.  
  
  
The brown liquid sailed in a perfect arc and splashed all over my freshly printed documents.  
  
  
A thick stack of corporate secrets instantly turned into a soggy, illegible mess.  
  
  
Staring at the destroyed files, I couldn't keep playing observer anymore.  
  
  
I looked up and locked eyes with her.  
  
  
Yet she had zero guilt on her face—actually looked pissed that I hadn't shared the stapler.  
  
  
My voice was ice cold.  
  
  
""You gonna take responsibility for trashing these documents?""  
  
  
Wren had probably never been called out by a company employee before.  
  
  
She blinked, confused.  
  
  
Then her face flushed red with anger.  
  
  
""Excuse me? How dare you talk to me like that?""  
  
  
""Do you have any idea who I am?""  
  
  
She straightened up, acting all high and mighty:  
  
  
""I'm Jaxon's wife!""  
  
  
Looking at her, I felt absolutely nothing—almost wanted to laugh.  
  
  
""Cool.""  
  
  
I replied flatly.  
  
  
""Does being Jaxon's wife give you license to destroy company property? To completely ignore workplace policies?""  
  
  
My pushback clearly threatened her little power trip.  
  
  
She lost her shit, pointing right in my face:  
  
  
""Um, yeah, it totally does!""  
  
  
""This whole company belongs to Jaxon, which means it's mine! I can do whatever the hell I want!""  
  
  
Her voice went full Karen mode, all screechy and entitled.  
  
  
""Who even are you? Some random new girl trying to school me?""  
  
  
Other employees came running when they heard yelling.  
  
  
Seeing this confrontation, they looked terrified.  
  
  
A few admin assistants kept tugging at my sleeve, silently begging me to apologize and back down.  
  
  
I didn't budge.  
  
  
I just stared her down.  
  
  
When I wouldn't cave, Wren felt humiliated in front of everyone.  
  
  
She whipped out her phone with this smug, vindictive smile.  
  
  
""Okay, wanna act tough? Think I can't handle some nobody?""  
  
  
""I'm FaceTiming Jaxon right now to show you exactly who runs this place!""  
  
  
She hit video call immediately.  
  
  
The call connected within seconds.  
  
  
She flipped the phone toward herself, ready to have her ""husband"" come to her rescue.

1nx9796,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nx9796/just_venting_about_my_job/,Just venting about my job,"Warning: long rant ahead. I feel bad for complaining, this is the best job I've had in my life, but there's definitely some downsides that are heavily weighing on me. I'm not looking for sympathy for getting myself in this situation, I just need a place to type out my thoughts and, as the subreddit says, get it off my chest.

I started this job in December 2024 last year, I was laid off of my old job October 2024, so the fact that I got a new job so quick filled me with so much gratitude; I promised to do whatever it took to stick in this job and perform my best.

My role was to be a receptionist for one of the two new offices this company was opening up in my state; I was hired alongside another girl because she was going to be the receptionist in the other office. The offices we were assigned to weren't open yet when we were hired, so we did WFH for the first two months to be trained and helped with put together the new offices (i.e. ordering supplies, getting to know the building's rules, etc.)

The office that I was not assigned to opened first in March, so I worked there in person alongside the other receptionist. I live in an extremely traffic heavy city, and this first office is located in the heart of the big city, so the commute was abysmal. Me and the other receptionist live in the same general area; and we found out on our first commute to this office, that it would take us 90 minutes to 2 hours (one way) to get to the office.

Now, I knew that this commute was going to be bad, that's why, during the interview process, when they asked me which office I preferred to work in, I picked the other office location because it would take me 30-40 minutes to get there. My coworker was under the impression that it would only take 40 minutes to get to this office, but she was just looking at the miles and not considering how awful.

The other receptionist, realizing this, said she would probably end up moving closer to the city, banking on her rich older boyfriend buying her an apartment in the city (which is ~$2,500 a month rent minimum in that area).

I continued to commute to that office, wasting at least 3 hours of my day in a car going to an office that wasn't assigned to me so I could help set things up and work alongside the other receptionist and one of the salesmen that worked in that office.

We were receptionists on paper, but our task list was a lot more, we were basically the office managers and also worked on special projects and event planning. It was either too much work or no work at all, so it was a funny balance to manage. My receptionist coworker and I managed the workload well together so neither of us felt too bombarded with work for the most part. There were a lot of times where we had downtime in the beginning, and my coworker would complain about the lack of work a lot. In hindsight, it was a pretty funny comment of her to make because she refused to do some of the assignments given to her.

The salesman who worked in the office would sometimes ask us to do personal assignments for him (very infrequently, like maybe once every other month), only if there was no work for us to do, like drop off a package for him. My coworker hated doing this type of work, there was one time where the salesman had made a care package for his family out of state and asked us to drop it off for him because he was swamped with work. We agreed, but my coworker was complaining the whole time about how this wasn't her job, and she shouldn't be doing this, even though we weren't really doing anything before he asked and she was complaining about the lack of things to do anyways.

In the care packages, there was a company branded candle that we have supplied in the office; when we got the post office, she dropped the candle and it broke. My coworker said that oh well, this person is just going to get a broken candle, and I told her no, there's more candles in the office, let's just drive back and replace it. She begrudgingly agreed and we drove back to replace it.

She then told me that there was a closer post office that they could walk to this time instead of the 10-minute drive we did to the first office. So, we walked 15-minutes to the post office only to realize that this ""closer"" post office was actually closed. My coworker got really fussy at this point and complained about how she shouldn't be doing this, and she wants to take her lunch break. I told her to take her lunch break, and I'll go to the post office and deliver the package. At my job before this, I was an administrative assistant who did bi-weekly post office runs, so I guess I'm more used the mail-duty type of work. She agreed to this, and I have the package delivered in about 20-minutes (and partially kicking myself because I thought, if I delivered this package by myself in the first place, it wouldn't have ate up so much time).

I think, because of things like this, the salesman liked me just a little bit more than my coworker and even asked me if I would consider switching office locations to make this one my main office. I didn't like how ""under the table"" he was asking it, and I didn't want to go behind my coworker's back like that; I saw the office I was assigned to me as my ""baby"" that I had to take care of in a way, and I assumed my coworker felt the same way about her main office and I didn't want to take that from her. The salesman understood, but I still think he saw my coworker as ""less willing to do the work"" than me.

Eventually, in about mid-May this year, the office I was assigned to was finished with construction; I saw the light at the end of the tunnel knowing I was almost done with that draining commute. I started going to my office that I was assigned to, even though there was no furniture in it yet sending status reports about the office's state to the executive team. I had a lot of fun getting the supplies for the office and organizing everything. I stopped going to the office that opened up first because my priority was setting up the office that was my responsibility.

Everything was, seemingly, fine, but then my coworker put in her two weeks' notice at the end of May; right after some of our executive members and out supervisor visited the office she was assigned to and sent us both a report on how it was not up to their standards and it needs to be in shape for when the CEO needs to visit it next week.

Now, I was surprised that the executives said that and that my coworker was leaving. I hadn't been to that office in nearly two weeks so I couldn't imagine how bad it could become in that short amount of time.

It turns out, my coworker also hadn't been to that office in two weeks. She was clocking in on her phone at home and doing interviews with other jobs during that time. The last time that that office had a receptionist is when I covered for my coworker because she had to take the day off to take her dog to the vet, which was in the middle of May.

I later went to lunch with my coworker about a month after she left, she told me she couldn't do the commute anymore (extremely understandable) and she wasn't planning on moving closer since her rich older boyfriend and her broke up (idk why).

Needless to say, the office was very neglected, supplies were not organized and all over the place, dust accumulated on surfaces, and the whole place was just, not up to our executive's standards (especially since the executives/our supervisor come from luxury retail, so they're expectations are high to say the least).

In my coworker's two-week notice email, that I was cced on, she said she would be supportive and help out during her last two weeks there; but she got sick and didn't show up in person once during her last two weeks. So, the responsibility of cleaning and organizing that entire office fell on my shoulders.

My executives and supervisor were freaking out because the office was in a messy state, and they thought my coworker was there for the long run. I tried to reassure them, telling them they're stuck with me for the long haul and that I will help as much as I can.

My supervisor was very strict with the standards and made sure to drill it into my head; she said she wanted the office to be ""instagramable"" in little ways that I thought was needless. For example, if we ordered something like sugar packets or highlighters, they couldn't stay in the box they came in, no, they had to be in these transparent containers and stacked neatly inside. All of the miscellaneous office supplies needed to by stored this way: paper, pens, cutlery, sweeteners, sticky notes, etc. Now, because we didn't have a lot of time to clean and set the office up, I couldn't order these containers online because they would arrive after our CEO visited. So, like the dumb loyal peon that I am, I went out to the Container Store and bought all the storage the office needed with my own money. I didn't expense it cause my supervisor kept complaining about how overbudget they were for the office already and I didn't want to throw on hundreds of dollars' worth of receipts on the pile (I am curious though if they think the containers just, came out of nowhere, like in the monthly budget they see the totals and items spent each month so do they just think it appeared out of nowhere when they saw them?? lol)

I've also bought snacks for both the offices because snacks weren't approved in the budget apparently, but people in the office kept complaining that there were no snacks around in the office. So, I spent my own money getting snacks in the office for both the workers and clients to eat; the executives didn't allow for snacks to be bought but don't question and enjoy the snacks present in the office whenever they visit.

Anyways, I spent that time driving that long ass commute to the office every day and organizing and cleaning everything, preparing it for the CEO's visit. The executives also asked me to make a 'Receptionist Guidelines' document for all of our receptionists to follow because they planned on opening offices in other states soon. So, I did that, it's filled with nitty gritty details like dress code, what flowers to keep in the office, what the executives like to drink/eat, how frequently you should serve the CEO coffee, how to serve clients during their visit, etc. 

I did all this before our CEO visited one week later, when he came, he was pleased with the state of the office, and the executive team was happy with the results. So happy, that they wanted this office to be the new standard for all of their offices going forward.

I was relieved that things were finally up to code, and I asked the executives when they think they would hire a new receptionist for the office. They told me they're looking, but they're really looking for someone who is the right fit for the role, until then, they asked me to cover both offices for the mean time.

Now, obviously I cannot be in two places at once, but what I've been doing is spending 3 days of the week in my office I was assigned to and 2 days in the other office. It is so draining having to keep up with the schedule and supplies in two different offices that are so far away from each other (about 70 miles apart). When I think I'm done with tasks in one office, something else pops up in the other I have to deal with. There have been some days where I've had to drive from one office to the other just cause there's something pressing going on, those days are brutal because they're about 2 hours and 30 minutes apart, so you can only imagine how draining the drive is. Not to mention that the actual work and assignments given to me are a lot more to deal with because I don't have another receptionist to help with the workload.

This has been going on since June and is completely destroyed any semblance of work/life balance I had; I am constantly drained, my apartment is a mess, I don't do any of my hobbies or cook anymore, I rarely message my friends back, and recently I've been having trouble with intimate moments between my partner and I cause my head is constantly bombarding with tasks.

The salesman in the other office was a big help, supporting me and covering tasks in the office for me when I was overwhelmed (and still hoping that I would be transferred to the office because we had a good work relationship). But he was let go early September so now I'm the only person covering and taking care of that office. Earlier this week, I drove 2 hours to that office (leaving at 6:50 am getting there at 9:05 am) just because no one was there to water the plants in the office like?? It's ridiculous that I am the only pillar holding these two offices up.

We do have someone hired for the spot soon (first day October 13), however, she isn't going to have the title ""receptionist,"" it's going to be the ""office manager"" for both the offices and I'm going to be reporting to her. Now, I did feel a little off about this because I thought, if anything I should be the office manager because I've taken care of both the offices, and I've proven myself to be loyal and helpful; but I just figured she was more experienced than me (I don't know the specifics of her resume but I know she was a manager at her previous job)

 However, earlier this week, I was asked to create a presentation on how to use PowerPoint and Excel because the new office manager apparently doesn't really know how to use them. One of the many assignments I do is research presentations and creating decks for the executives to present. How is it fair at all that this new person gets the title of office manager, but has the same tasks that I do, and I have train them on the basics they should know about?? I'm not against training new higher ups, there are some company specific things that all new hires, regardless of if they're above or below you on the totem pole, need to be taught. But PowerPoint and Excel??? Those skills are some of the reasons why I got hired, if those weren't on my resume and knew less would I get a better title and people reporting to me?? That just made me mad a bit, but I made the tutorial presentation and will be presenting it next week, so I hope it goes well.

There are so many other things I want to whine about, like my supervisor, I feel bad about complaining cause she's a hard worker and has many wonderful qualities, but she's so shallow it hurts.

For example, when the old receptionist left, my supervisor asked me if I had any friends that could take the role and don't live too far from the office. I had a friend in mind, she's a coworker from my first job that I'm still really close with. My first job was a hellish nightmare that makes my current role look like heaven on earth; and my coworker was still stuck working there and having bad luck interviewing for a new job. I thought she would be perfect fit since she's so kind and hospitable, the type of person you'd want to greet people (and she also knows PowerPoint and Excel lol). My supervisor wanted to see what my friend looked like, so I pulled up a picture of my her, she has thick dark hair and naturally rosy cheeks, she's is a very beautiful woman. However, my supervisor started to laugh and shooed away my photo, telling me she was way ""too big"" for the role, and if they have a not-front-of-house position open, they'll interview her. I was disgusted by this comment and how casually my supervisor said it, but I just had to laugh it off.

She also comments on my body, skin, and what I eat. I was eating a smoothie bowl one day and she said ""are you sure? that's a lot of sugar, you seem so healthy"" which made me feel awful. I've had disordered eating in the past and it's just come back stronger; I either skip or have very low-cal meals now and I definitely try not to eat in front of her.

I also have struggled with acne in the past and don't wear makeup. There was one time where I visited the out-of-state headquarters for a week, and I was so nervous and stressed about it that I started breaking out. It wasn't horrible, but there were some big red spots on my chin. My supervisor and I went to lunch with some of the new hires I was getting to know, and during lunch, she took her nail and did a scratch/wipe over the acne on my chin. I think she thought that it was sauce on my chin, but I just looked at her and told her I was having a bad skin week and breaking out and told her that I was working on it.

She pulled out her phone because she wanted to take a group picture and said, loudly, that ""she'll just use a filter on my face."" It was disheartening to see the photo pop up in the company group chat and seeing everyone else's full features and freckles, while I had a very apparent blur erasing my skin texture.

I'm sure she talks about my appearance behind my back as well, I just have a feeling since there's a lot of ""cliquey"" culture in the office where people gossip about one another. I don't participate, but I have overheard some pretty mean things from these work gossip sessions.

There are other comments that my supervisor has made that bother me a lot like when I had to purchase flowers for the office I was assigned to, they wanted it to look a lot like the flowers in the other office but wanted to spend less because my office is the ""less expensive"" office. I found a local florist who said they'll recreate a look for a fraction of the price, and we purchased their services.

They delivered the flowers, I personally thought they were lovely, my supervisor saw them and kept laughing about how they were the Shien of Temu version of the other office's flowers and even told our Chief of Staff that comment. She asked me next time, when the flowers need replanting, to tell the florist to send up bigger flowers next time, and I said okay but inside I was upset that she was being such a choosy beggar; like, if you want flowers for an affordable price, they're going to be a little bit smaller than the ones we got from the big luxury dealer sorry!!

She also keeps trying to get me to use ChatGPT to do my work for me, but I actually like doing my own work and learning so I pass whenever she tries to turn me on it.

Anyways, that's all for now, there's definetly more things I could mention but I'm just tired and feel like I will never have a personal life ever again. Another salesman called me yesterday and I asked him if he knows anything about if they're hiring a new salesperson for the other office soon. He told me they're taking they're time since they took a chance on the last salesman there. He said they recently interviewed someone, but she mentioned work/life balance in the interview and knew she wasn't going to be a good fit because ""the company culture isn't about that.""

I don't know what to do, I'm secretly jealous of my coworker who left because she valued herself and her time and left and now works at a closer job that lets her WFH on Fridays and has snacks in the office for free. I wish I valued myself instead of this company that's draining me.

I'm burnt out, I'm tired, I go home and I do nothing, I haven't seen my friends in forever, I don't enjoy my old hobbies. I feel like I'm a camel with a countless amount of straw on their back and people keep throwing more straw on there, smiling and saying ""look at how much straw this camel can carry!! their back is never going to break we can just keep piling straw on forever and it'll never break!!"" all the while the knees on the camel buckled out a while ago, but the feet are still flat on the ground and the straw is still being carried, so it doesn't matter.

I'm hoping that things get better after the new office manager comes and I don't have to drive to the other office as often anymore; that's what I'm riding on for now.

I recently discovered a feature in Promova called AI Role Play and wanted to share. It simulates real conversations with an AI partner across 50+ scenarios: ordering coffee, checking into a hotel, even job interviews. You speak out loud, the app responds naturally, and instantly gives tips on pronunciation, fluency, and clarity.

What I found cool:

* More lifelike dialogues than typical chatbots
* You can review and repeat mistakes without feeling embarrassed
* No sense of being “judged” - it feels safe

They’ve processed over 400K voice messages, and many users report a boost in confidence. If you’re curious, check it out here: 

[https://promova.com/press/promova-ai-role-play](https://promova.com/press/promova-ai-role-play)

Has anyone else tried this? How natural does it feel compared to real-life practice or language meetups? Any tips for getting the most out of these role-play sessions?

1nx8yr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/1nx8yr0/new_to_the_subreddit/,New to the Subreddit,"Hi - I've recently moved to Brussels and I've started to learn french. I had some basic stuff from school (an A at GCSE for what its worth) but I now realised how poor my level is.

Work have paid for me to use something called  GOFLuent. Has anyone used this? I'd love to hear thoughts and feedback, and also how best to utilise it? I have 20 hours of lessons with that. I've used 3 hours so far, four 45 minute lessons with the same tutor.

  
I've also done some of the A1 stuff on the learning pages on the same website.

Some other things I'm doing - watching an episode of scrubs a day in French(with french subtitles). They use the word coucher a lot haha.

Listening to Innerfrench on occasion (but not often enough). 

Listening to coffee-break french - but i must admit, I've stopped this since using gofluent and watching more scrubs.

My level is low, at the moment with my teacher we are going over all the different verb groups of present te,se- eg Group 1 ending in er, group 2 ending in ir, group 3 ending in god knows what else. 

I am a bit overwhelmed by it all right now, and i find my ability to speak still very poor. I want to practise speaking more but i simple am not finding i have the confidence, or when i do the belgians will quicly (and helpfully) switch to English when I stumble. And since i havent really got any friends here yet, and certainly no french speaking ones, I'm still finding that getting the opportunity to practise isn't coming that much. 

These are of course excuses, I'm shy and not overly confident, in English my native tongue i dont often strike conversations with strangers or the staff in coffee shops, but now i realise i should probably try to in order to get better at my french.

  
A few other aps i've tried.

  
Jumpspeak - firstly im sick of the adverts for this. It was ok but not worth the money, and the AI chatbot thing doesn't register what you say properly. 

Duolingo - I barely go on this but i do have my brother's account, occasionally I'll kill 5 minutes on there.



My aim - to get to a GOOD a1 level in 4-6 months. ANd then get to A2 level in a year.

My time in Belgium is indefinte. 

  
Also, I can't attend in person classes as they are often weekly and i am a shift worker - unless anyone has any reccomendations for within the city for something a bit different to the commune run classes.",1,1759520321.0,learnfrench,0,1.0,False

1nx8s3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1nx8s3k/what_i_want_from_ai_exactlybrian_collins/,What I want from AI. Exactly—Brian Collins,"Brian Collins wrote this today on LinkedIn comparing the Macintosh moment of the ’80s to what’s happening with AI now. Do you buy it, or is this time different?

# What I want from AI. Exactly.

The future never waits for an invitation. 

It just barges in, dripping wet, asking where the bathroom is. You can either welcome it or turn off the lights, pretending you’re not home. Either way, the door has been blown off its hinges.

I bought my first Macintosh in 1985, straight out of MassArt. That beige brick was my gateway drug. I loved it instantly—not because it was beautiful (it looked like a breadbox from Sears), but because it horrified all the right people. The leading modernist designers and typographers were clutching their pearls. Emigre, the upstart digital type foundry, had just unleashed fonts that looked like punk ransom notes and bad decisions. Massimo Vignelli pronounced the Emigre foundry as a threat to all design ideals. An “aberration of culture.”

To which every young designer replied: “Yes, please. More.”

Back then, getting typography meant sending floppy discs with your designs to a type house and praying each carefully placed line break survived the return trip. I once sent a layout composed entirely in Emigre fonts. The typesetter literally laughed in my face. He patted my Mac like it was a mutt. “How long will this fad last? Serious clients will always need filet mignon, perfectly cooked by master chefs. That machine is a hamburger.”

He was right. It was a hamburger. The thing is, everyone likes hamburgers. And now there was a new market for them. Only a few years later, the Mac was running faster, smarter and new digital fonts were breeding like rabbits. The machine's swift improvement had suddenly put that old filet mignon on the menu – right beside my burgers. And the typesetter’s massive, hand-operated Compugraphic phototypesetting systems were being sold for scrap.

For me, the best part? All of my carefully, passionately crafted, late-night work was now kept perfectly intact on my own Mac. So, if something went screwy, I could fix it myself with a keystroke. No more costly miscommunication or mistranslation at the typesetter's. No more waiting for the next day. The creative half life of my work had been geometrically expanded by this new technology.

What I learned then was this: anyone declaring the future is a joke is usually just tired of trying to keep up.

And now the laughter and hand wringing is back. Only this time it’s about AI. Same sermon, different century. ""Where is the real craft, the real designers, the real typography?” People always want to make new technology sound like a threat to civilization. It’s not. Civilization is a threat to civilization. New technology just gives us more interesting ways to play, work and imagine, while we try to make civilization better.

Here's the thing: AI doesn’t need your hand on its shoulder to produce work. It doesn’t need your guidance to multiply variations by the thousands, to translate your brand guidelines into a hundred languages before you’ve even had your first coffee, to catch the wrong design on a shelf in  Minneapolis before a consumer sees it. Left alone, it will keep iterating—relentless, shameless, and utterly tireless. You don’t have to stand there telling it how to do its job. It already knows. Or it will by Tuesday.

But this is not a “hamburger” moment. This is not the thing that will eventually get good. It already *is* good. Tomorrow it will be obscene. The day after that it will be intolerable. Which is to say: useful.

Building a valued company or a beloved brand using design has always been about executing consistently against a sharp intent. Design is about understanding context and  dynamically shaping that intent. But for the majority of my career, the hardest part has been ensuring that nagging, accurate consistent execution part actually happens. Now, we have technology that will be capable of doing just that – and extending the half life of good design far, far beyond what the Macintosh first promised. Imagine AI systems building, monitoring, adapting and correcting themselves—maintaining the grid while we’re out breaking it. Systems that keep the brand alive in the chaos of TikTok while we’re arguing about Pantone colors back in the studio. Imagine if every deck, doc, and post of yours stays on-brand. Not because you had to police them all to death, but because the brand itself is living and defending its own borders like a benevolent nightclub bouncer. Because if AI helps the scaffolding hold itself up, we get to spend our energy on the big swings—the ideas, the products, the campaigns no one’s ever seen before—while the system keeps the everyday stuff from collapsing into chaos

The dream, the way I saw it, was never to sit in front of a drafting table for three days adjusting kerning by hand. That wasn’t noble. That was carpal tunnel.

The dream for creative people was to have a creative system that keeps running when you’re asleep or sulking. To have a collaborator who has ideas faster than you can write them down, and keeps yours intact from the moment they leave your desk to the minute they appear on a screen, in a store or in someone's home.

Charles Eames warned us, “never delegate your understanding.”

Fine. Don’t.

But now you can delegate everything else and watch it go.



# TL;DR

The Macintosh horrified the establishment, but it gave designers control, speed, and permanence—and changed everything. AI is that moment again, only bigger. It’s not a fad or a “hamburger” waiting to get good; it’s already good, soon to be intolerably good. Let it handle the execution so we can focus on the big swings. Don’t delegate your understanding—delegate everything else.

I arrived at a complicated time in my life, where I came from depression and more than 15 years of not believing in anything, so I met the missionaries who were in the neighborhood at that time, they were very kind to me and since there was still some traces of the pandemic everything was by video calls, but there was something strange in the third call, they told me we scheduled his baptism and I was investigating (which I didn't do well, I accept it) about that church.

Something I told them, no, I'm not ready for that yet, so my first time in the chapel was the last day of those missionaries on their mission, they gave me the book of Mormon and told me, ask the Lord if this is true, which I asked and I didn't have an answer but I said maybe that answer isn't from one day to the next hahaha I continued attending and it was almost Christmas and they invited me to turn on the lights in their temple, the bishop was very kind to me (he always has been, I can't say no) we were there and just like when he baptized me it was a pressure because it seems that they They give commission for each person who does it.

So months later I said ok, I'm baptized, they told me but you have to pay 10% of ALL your income and I eat because, that's what Mr. Ha wants is that he can't drink coffee or black or green tea and I oh damn and then what am I going to drink, well, things that don't alter it and the tea doesn't alter me but ok I did it stupidly.

The next day after the confirmation and that it was already part of the priesthood and I said and what it is I had no idea but I was already a new member, the majority of the neighborhood go and congratulate you as if they really cared, the majority are people hypocritical who is going to wash away his sins there by giving a tithe. I realized that there were many members who did not agree with the Bishop, he had little when I became a member and any decision of his was questioned and judged and I, well, not that here it is all love for others, I was constant in attending but I never paid a full tithe and I never planned to do it if I gave 20 dollars in two and a half years it was a lot but I always noticed something that was an aberration for me, the pressure they give to children and young people to go on a mission, I remember one occasion at a stake meeting there was a girl no older than 3 years old with a plaque that said future missionary and I stayed looking at her parents and how do you know that when she grows up she wants to be one or just because you feel like it.

I had a lot of contact with their missionaries, I appreciate many things and their great faith, but they also told me how difficult it was for them, they really wanted to return but what was their family and the neighborhood going to say so they stayed, I remember seeing them with the broken shoes, their torn suits and I'm damned because the church doesn't take care of those details but they make them believe there you have broken shoes, it is a sign that you are doing great in your mission, please, miserable church that only asks and asks and does not take care of them when they do the dirty work.

I rarely stayed in his priesthood or Sunday school classes, because damn there was no time when the big tithing payers were bothering you and I pay it and I am super blessed, they must pay it, if you don't pay it you are not complying with the Lord, and worshiping a pedophile like Joseph Smith, and his supposed apostles and seer and revelatory prophets, those old people from UTAH have as psychics what I have as an astronaut NOTHING! but since they didn't fit me, I wasn't a good member, always making those who don't follow their rules feel bad, they make you feel guilty and miserable. They gave me the Melchizedek priesthood, strange because I was never a full tithe payer, the stake president told me, but in December he can pay everything and of course you will have it, laughing at him inside me. There was a member who did not have a disability for his income and he went to ask for help, they sent him directly to you know where, there is no money, ask his family, see if the members want him.

In short, what most triggered me to try to flee from that church was when I began to read their doctrines and agreements. Please, how can you believe that bunch of nonsense, justifying their polygamy, that women have no value, and so many things that you already know, and they sent me to the temple course, I remember I arrived and there was no room to take that course, they told us it would be this one and the person in charge of the family history arrived, a despotic guy, to take us out almost shouting, this is my room, look for another one but in such a rude and despotic way that I said what the hell am I doing? here. Not that he is a man of God by his calling or just because he pays tithing. From there I have not returned to that chapel, every month I helped the missionaries with a meal, it was my way of helping them two months ago, magically I am not required.

The missionaries went to my house but there was no one at home, I saw it through the cameras at the entrance, from there no one has looked for me and that gives me peace of mind, when they tell you don't drink coffee but how about Coca Cola in meetings. 1.- It is a church that only wants your money. 2.- Who idolizes pedophiles and polygamists. 3.- That doesn't help in the slightest. 4.- Full of lies that is the church of Jesus Christ. 5.- And most of the people I knew see you in the chapel and greet you, hug you, see them on the street and turn around so as not to. 6.-The pressure on children and young people is horrible and sectarian. 7.- And they are fed up with their blessings for paying a tithe (one day I asked someone and what blessing you have) because I don't lack anything and neither do I and I don't give them my money. I thank God for opening my eyes and I hope to never set foot in one of their places again. Sorry for so much text but I had to express it.",5,1759519765.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

TL;DR: I read that 2018 article about Glitterex’s “mystery customer,” sold everything, moved from Michigan to New Jersey, worked my way inside the company, and discovered the biggest buyer is not toothpaste or makeup but the defense industry using glitter as invisible tracers in covert coatings. This is my full story.

⸻

Throwaway account. This is long. But if you’ve ever wondered about the infamous Glitter Conspiracy, this is it.

⸻

Chapter 1: The Spark (2018)

I was just a guy in central Michigan. Population maybe 4,000. Days in retail at Meijer, nights playing guitar at a dive bar off US-127. Then I read that interview with the Glitterex rep back in 2018.

The journalist asked: “Who’s your biggest customer?”

The rep clammed up. Wouldn’t say. Hinted: “You’d never guess. You’d hate it. They don’t want anyone knowing it’s glitter.”

That quote stuck in my head like a splinter. What could possibly be so bad about glitter?

By the end of 2019, I had decided: I’m going to find out.

⸻

Chapter 2: The Move East

I sold my amp, my record player, my granddad’s old Chevy just to fund a one-way bus ticket to New Jersey. Glitterex’s main plant is in Cranford. That’s where I needed to be.

My first apartment was a one-bedroom near Newark Airport with cracked windows and a landlord who never fixed the heat. Planes rattled the dishes at night.

I couldn’t just walk into Glitterex. So I started at the edges: a plastics supplier in Edison. My job was 12-hour shifts stacking pallets of metallized film. The place smelled like acetone and melted tinsel. My hands were constantly nicked from sharp film edges.

I enrolled at Middlesex County College for a business degree. Days in the warehouse, nights in class, studying on the bus ride home, greasy diner coffee at 2 a.m.

I kept telling myself: one foot inside the glitter machine.

⸻

Chapter 3: Into the Orbit

Two years later, a supervisor named Olivia Chen noticed me. She was sharp, no-nonsense, and saw me staying late learning the inventory system. She recommended me for a job at a partner plant doing film cutting for Glitterex.

That job nearly broke me. Hours of feeding massive rolls of film into slicing machines, your shirt smelling like glue, your hands coated in microscopic flakes that stuck to your skin like static.

By 2022, I transferred to a subcontracted facility down the road from Glitterex HQ. Close enough to smell the same chemical tang in the air.

That’s where I met Marcus Villanueva, a mid-level manager overseeing additive integration. He wasn’t chatty, but one day he mentioned his wife Charlotte was running a charity golf outing in West Orange at Essex County Country Club. I volunteered to help—handing out bottled water, lining up carts.

I spent an hour talking with Charlotte about local charities and how Marcus “worked with some of the weirdest materials no one talks about.” That conversation cracked open the door.

Soon after, Marcus invited me to a backyard cookout in Union County. There I met Kevin Adams, a QC lead from the main plant, and Janine Park, a logistics coordinator who joked she “knew more about where glitter goes than Santa’s elves.” It was the first time I’d been in the same backyard as actual insiders.

⸻

Chapter 4: Crossing the Fence

By 2023, I was offered a position in quality control at one of Glitterex’s satellite buildings. I tested batches for reflectivity, measured flake sizes, logged them into sprawling spreadsheets.

That’s when I saw the client codes. Most were normal — cosmetics, craft suppliers. But a handful were flagged as “Classified Clients.” No names, just strings of letters. Employees explicitly told: “Don’t ask. Don’t talk.”

By early 2024, I finally got clearance for the main facility. That’s where I saw what most people never do:
	•	Biometric doors that scanned your palm before entry.
	•	Rows of cutting machines running in near-vacuum, slicing plastic film into dust-sized flakes.
	•	Shipping crates stamped with vague terms like “substrate coating materials.”
	•	Memos warning: “Client X demands strict non-disclosure. Any leaks will terminate contracts.”
	•	A lab nicknamed “The Silver Room” where they tested microflakes under exotic lasers.

At lunch in the cafeteria, Janine would whisper, “Sometimes I think we’re making fairy dust for dragons.” Kevin would just smirk and say, “You don’t want to know.”

I started noticing patterns: pallets marked for “Desert Systems,” “AeroCore,” “West Range,” all going out at night under private courier.

⸻

Chapter 5: The Discovery

It took months of cross-referencing batch logs, shipping invoices, and destination addresses. They didn’t go to craft stores. They went to desert testing ranges in Nevada, aerospace facilities near Albuquerque, and subcontractors with ties to defense contractors.

It clicked.

The “mystery customer” wasn’t a toothpaste brand or the Mint. It was the defense and surveillance industry.

The glitter wasn’t normal. It was micro-engineered flakes layered with rare compounds. Invisible to the naked eye when embedded in coatings, but under specific laser or infrared scans they reflected in a narrow band.

They use it to:
	•	Detect microcracks in stealth aircraft and ships.
	•	Map debris fields from munitions tests.
	•	Embed “smart surfaces” in aerospace vehicles that can be monitored remotely.
	•	Track stress and pressure on experimental tech without opening it up.

It’s genius. It’s horrifying. It’s not glitter for fun — it’s glitter for war.

I remember standing in the Silver Room watching a technician spray a sample panel, then shine a near-infrared beam on it. The whole thing lit up like a constellation under the scanner but looked blank to the naked eye. That’s when my stomach dropped.

⸻

Chapter 6: The Memo

Last month, a memo went out: “Client X demands purge of unauthorized logs. Increased surveillance of staff. Any suspicion of leaks will result in termination.”

Kevin stopped joking. Janine stopped coming to lunch. Even Marcus looked pale.

That was my breaking point. I realized they were tightening the noose, scrubbing evidence, preparing to bury the truth.

I copied what I could, stored it offsite, and today I’m here writing this.

⸻

The Reveal

So here it is, the truth nobody wanted to say out loud:

The world’s biggest buyer of glitter is the defense industry. They use it in covert military coatings, surveillance tracers, and aerospace monitoring.

It’s not toothpaste.
It’s not fish.
It’s not dollar bills.

It’s war tech.

⸻

Signing Off

I know some of you wanted a funny answer, like “it’s in Oreos” or “your car paint.” The truth is uglier and a hell of a lot less fun.

I’ve already backed everything up and sent it to people who can investigate further. As for me? I’m done. I’ve packed my bags and I’m leaving this life behind.

This is my final post. Believe it or don’t. But at least now, when people talk about the Glitter Conspiracy, you know the real answer.

Did you see the colors today?  How positively beautiful!  The sunlight shining on your face as you rode your bike with all the golden and amber leaves shimmering in the background.  Did you see me take those pictures of you?  I needed to get a shot of how the sun catches your hair!  Beautiful!  A beautiful man -you, you are that beautiful man and a beautiful woman -me, that's me and you better figure it out and soon or there will be consequences!  And a beautiful campus!  Snap! Snap!  That's what I did all day today!  While eating last night Audrey asked me how my pictures are going.  Hee hee she doesn't know!  I said that the camera had limited memory and it's frustrating.  ""How many pictures do you need?""  Brenda asked me.  They don't know what I'm doing and I am.... ""stoked"" that is what they say here.  ""To stoke"" or ""to encourage"" or ""to add fuel"" or maybe estoy tan emocionada or maybe ""avivó"" what a funny language.  I should use ""stoked"" in Fluency class!

They do not know I am stalking and taking pictures of you, Finnian.  Hello Finnian, I am your stalker, Pilar, I know you are pleased to meet me.  [hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz4l9_bzfZM&list=RDBz4l9_bzfZM)  Are you stoked to have such a beautiful stalker like me?  Shall I stoke you or shall you stoke me?  Oh, please do!

Wait until we meet, Love!

So she lent me another card to switch out in my camera so I can take more pictures during the day!  ""I'm not going to use it, I've seen enough of CSU."" - Audrey  Yes, Audrey, you have but I haven't seen enough of him, so I am very stoked to use your card!  Snap Snap in Fluency class, it was a snap. And afterwards... snap! snap! Pictures of Finnian on his way to Biology!  I bet you are a winner in Biology too!  What am I saying?  With over 100% in Chemistry then you are definitely getting high marks in Biology.  My man is so smart.  Snap Snap in Composition  and so my day went!

I was ""stoked"" at work and I was insufferable with Brenda.  Chattering away and so she asked if I could handle the nonexistent line at RamCache so she could go to the bathroom.  She left me with only the noise from the hall and a guy walked in to fill his card.  I smiled as he told me his name and I looked him dead in the eye and typed Finnian's last name.  There are three Kennedys on campus, I selected 'F' for first name and there he was.  I smiled at the no name who cares guy and said ""My computer's down, let me use the other one.""  I finished his transaction and he left.  Thank you for leaving.  There I was with no one there and Finnian's account wide open, the command cursor blinking.  I giggled and took some more notes.

Student ID # 72055-98 with job code #PATH23716ENVSER

Credit Card last 4# 5628

Initial deposit was $500 on August 20th

His balance is $349.18

He has had no deposits since then.  And he spent $125.97 at the CSU bookstore on Sept 10.

Then he spent $3.55 again and again.  Mostly on Friday sometimes on Wednesday!  Friday 11:15am, Friday 11:23am, Friday 11:18am and... a Wednesday 7:22pm, the 23rd....Finnian!  That's IVCF time!  You!  I'm telling, or chisme maybe!

These are mainly Friday and a couple of Wednesdays during IVCF!  -Starbucks-  You have a coffee habit at the 11am hour or 7pm hour.  Honestly this is great but I was hoping for more.  I don't know what I expected.  Ah Finnian, I looked in your account and I am so turned on right now.  I wonder if you knew would you like being stalked like this?  No.  You'd be pissed.  Ok, so I had some fun and I put it away.  No more RamCache stalking.  At least not for a long while.  I'll look up your job code.  Still...I am so taken by you...I know that Starbucks is in view of RamCache.  I will be seeing you!  I loaded an additional 28 pictures of you just so you know.  Lastly, Finnian, I got an 88% on a Psych test!  Now, about the weekends.

Adios, Love

\[At the time digital cameras had limited memory so I was constantly filling the card and uploading the pics to my computer.  Audrey was kind enough to lend me another card.  The word play with ""stoked"" is a reflection that I was learning more American slang.  I was very amped up this day and I was embracing stalking him.  I was hooked on it.  Obviously, I looked into his RamCache account again.  Remember, before posting this I changed the actual revealing information.  I got the job code, which I wanted.  I didn't care about the money but his spending habit keyed me in to watch for him at another location.  This is real stalking, slow and gradual observations that lead to more pieces of the puzzle.  Now I know when he gets coffee and where he may be during IVCF meetings when he is not there.  ""Chisme"" is Spanish style gossip where you can plant a rumor as well as receive a rumor and it acts as a news chain.  It's more than gossip.  I am suggesting that I could use this information to get him to more IVCF meetings or at least meetings with me.  Starbucks was actually across the hall and down a little from RamCache.\]",2,1759519583.0,Obsessive_Love,0,1.0,False

It looked like they were just having coffee talking to themselves. I walk pass them and they don't even look at me. 


I walk towards the platfrom and see another cart almost 40 feet from the other car, there were two younger guys actually looked very sloppy dressed. Like I wouldn't even go to my office dress like them. They were also deep in conversation and laughing, next to them were a group of Amish people. 


I see that my train is delayed so I go to walk over to the station building and use the restroom and inside the main station there was another cart, this time it was two older maybe late 60's ladies sitting down on a bench next to the cart talking to each other. 


I walk right past them and they don't even look up at me, I was ready to say something if they did. 


I have never seen so many carts in one area before, you would think they might split up and go to other stations? 


Eventually my train comes and I see that the two younger guys are packing their cart up. I couldn't see the elderly JW's or the older ladies from my train car.

1nx8ia2,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1nx8ia2/review_the_chedi_el_gouna_red_sea/,"Review: The Chedi, El Gouna Red Sea","My first time posting here, but as I couldn’t find any review on here I thought I’ll share my insights. We just got back from The Chedi El Gouna and overall it’s probably one of the best hotels in Egypt. The design, the calm vibe, and the service culture really set it apart. But since people on here usually appreciate honest reviews – here’s the good and the not-so-good.

⸻

The Good
	•	Breakfast: Probably the best in Egypt. Great variety, excellent quality, and even proper barista coffee (not a given here). Super calm atmosphere – no chaos, no noise.

	•	Service: Staff are very friendly and attentive (sometimes even a little too deferential). The GM was present, waiters remembered our coffee orders from the previous day, some staff remembered us by name and the housekeeping manager was genuinely interested in making us happy. WhatsApp service worked well and requests through the app were answered. 

Something small that really stood out - at night if a golf cart would pass you (driven by hotel staff) the would turn of their head lights, to prevent from blending you. Small details like this add to the hotels LHW label. 

	•	Design & Rooms: Beautifully designed with a very consistent aesthetic. The rooms and public areas are stylish, with great quality linens, pillows, towels, and bathroom fittings. Beds are fantastic. Details like a beach bag, shoe bag, etc. are thoughtful.

	•	Atmosphere: Super peaceful at breakfast, dinner, and the beach. Even though the hotel was busy, it never felt crowded.

	•	Garden & Pool: Immaculately kept gardens. At the pool, staff handed out fruit and cold towels. Sunbeds were prepared for us. The whole setting is really pleasant.

	•	Extras: Free lagoon tour (nice touch). Small boutique vibe – the hotel feels intimate, not a mega-resort.

⸻

The Not-So-Good
	•	Room Wear & Tear: The first room we got had a depressing view and lots of issues (shower fittings falling off, heavy wear and tear). We moved to a much nicer, brighter room – but even there the shower arm was broken. For a “Leading Hotels of the World” property, that level of upkeep isn’t acceptable.

	•	Housekeeping: Very inconsistent. In one room it was meticulous (cables rolled up, everything neat). In another, it felt rushed – turndown only done on one side of the bed, towels folded sloppily, bathroom not properly cleaned. Sometimes housekeeping came as late as 4pm.

	•	Details & Welcome: Our Leaders Club welcome card was left completely blank, and after the room move we even got the wrong welcome letter. Small things, but in this league, details matter. Also: no special welcome amenity for Leaders Club.

	•	Food & Music: Breakfast amazing, dinner decent but rushed – we were pushed through a 4-course meal in under an hour. The bigger issue: the music. German rap in the restaurant, loud pop at the beach club… it kills the vibe. Soft house or jazz would fit so much better.

	•	Beach Experience: Beautiful setting, but two negatives:
	•	Guests having their own music weren’t told to turn it down (not great if you’re paying for peace and quiet).
	•	At this level, you’d expect small complimentary touches like free bottled water along with the cooling towels at your lounger (which were actually provided) – instead you always have to order/pay. Prices are fair, but the gesture would elevate the experience.
	•	Upselling: This was honestly the most annoying part. Constant attempts to sell something: “Golden Menu” at dinner, nudging us for Tripadvisor reviews, aggressively pushing the hair salon (someone even came up to our lounger at the beach with a tacky flyer). The hotel shop also sells obvious fakes, which really doesn’t fit a luxury brand.
	•	Facilities & Extras:
	•	The bikes are ridiculously overpriced and in bad shape (flat tires, broken brakes). Tuk-tuks are cheaper and safer – but then it clashes with El Gouna’s sustainability narrative.
	•	The “Prima Salon” doesn’t match the hotel’s style at all – looks cheap and out of place.
	•	Smoke from the grill drifted into the restaurant in two evenings with BBQ.
	•	Our airport driver randomly stopped for gas on the way. Again, small things, but they add up.
	•	Special Occasions: On my birthday, no staff member (not even our guest ambassador) said anything – which was a bit disappointing. They did decorate the room nicely and arranged the cake I wanted, though.

⸻

Overall

The Chedi El Gouna is hands-down one of the best hotels in Egypt. The vibe is intimate, calm, and stylish, with an incredible breakfast and genuinely caring staff. For that reason alone, it’s worth it.

That said, having stayed at other Leading Hotels of the World, l would agree that it mostly lives up to the standards, but with some regional deviations meaning that there are definitely some areas which need fine tuning - such as the wear and tear, inconsistent service, pushy upselling, and mismatched details.

Still, for Egypt – it’s a fantastic option and probably the best choice in El Gouna. Just go in knowing it’s very good, not yet perfect.",2,1759519253.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

1nx8agf,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1nx8agf/im_creating_ai_prompts_for_procrastination/,I'm creating AI prompts for procrastination (because I struggle too). Would this actually help?,"Hey everyone, 

I need to be honest—I procrastinate constantly. 

I'll have a project due, know exactly what I need to do, and then... I'll reorganize my desk, check social media, make coffee, or do anything except actually START the thing.

 The worst part? The guilt and anxiety while procrastinating are worse than just doing the task. But I still can't seem to START.

I've tried:

\- Pomodoro technique (works sometimes, then I fall off)

\- To-do lists (they just make me feel overwhelmed)

\- ""Just do it for 5 minutes"" (I end up NOT doing it).

Recently I started using ChatGPT to help break through my procrastination blocks, and it's actually been helping. Not perfectly, but better than anything else I've tried.

\*\*So I'm thinking of creating a collection of ChatGPT prompts specifically for procrastination.\*\*

Things like:

\- \*\*""I'm overwhelmed by \[task\]. Break it down into the smallest possible first steps.""\*\*

\- Gets me unstuck when tasks feel too big

\- \*\*""Why am I really avoiding \[task\]? Help me identify the underlying fear or reason.""\*\*

\- Sometimes I'm not procrastinating the task; I'm avoiding something deeper

\- \*\*""Give me a 5-minute version of \[task\] to just get started.""\*\*

\- Makes starting feel less scary

\- \*\*""I'm stuck in perfectionism on \[task\]. Help me define 'good enough.'\*\*

\- I often don't start because it won't be perfect.

\- \*\*""Be my accountability partner. Ask me questions about my progress on \[task\].""\*\*

\- External accountability helps

\- \*\*""I keep getting distracted. Help me refocus on \[task\].""\*\*

\- For when I'm mid-task and losing focus

\*\*My questions for you:\*\*

1. \*\*Would a collection of prompts like these actually help you?\*\* Or is this just something that works for me?

2. \*\*What situations do you procrastinate most?\*\* So I can create prompts for those specific scenarios.

3. \*\*What would you want included\*\* that I haven't thought of?

I'm not trying to sell anything (yet)—I genuinely want to know if this would be useful to others before I spend time organizing it into something more formal.

I feel like a lot of productivity advice comes from people who don't really struggle with procrastination. This would be from someone IN THE TRENCHES with you.

Anyone else using AI/ChatGPT to fight procrastination? What works for you?

Time to Trim Your WP Site,"WordPress loves plugins, but it also loves bloat. Every option you never use is a potential performance hit, a security risk, and an extra line of code you’ll never touch.  
If you’re running the same 30‑option SEO tool, the full WooCommerce suite, or that one analytics plugin with every single setting turned on, your TTFB will rise faster than your coffee cooling down.

Custom snippets are the cleanest way to get the exact functionality you need without the overhead. A few lines in `functions.php` or a tiny isolated plugin can replace dozens of settings and keep your site lean.  
You’ll cut HTTP requests, reduce memory usage, and avoid the endless “update required” notifications that come with bloated packages.

The problem isn’t WordPress itself—it’s the market’s appetite for one‑size‑fits‑all solutions. If you’re a dev or even a semi‑proficient admin, start asking: *Do I really need this feature?* And if the answer is “no,” just drop it or replace it with a snippet.

I thought I was being mature about it. Progressive even. We've been married for eight years and things got boring. I started reconnecting with two guys I dated before him. Just texting at first. Then coffee. Then I realized I missed that excitement.

So I sat my husband down last month and explained it to him. I said I loved him but I needed more. I told him about my exes and how they made me feel alive again. I said we could have an open arrangement where I could see them but still come home to him.

He just stared at me. His face went completely blank.

""You want me to share you with your exes,"" he said.

""It's not like that. I'm not leaving you. I just need this.""

He didn't yell. He didn't argue. He just said okay.

I actually thought he understood. I thought he was evolved enough to handle it. I started seeing both exes regularly. I'd tell my husband I was going out and he'd just nod. He seemed fine with it.

Then two weeks ago he invited them both over for dinner.

I came home from work and they were sitting in our living room. My husband was serving them drinks like we were having a normal gathering. My stomach dropped.

""What's going on?"" I asked.

""Just wanted to meet the guys you've been spending so much time with,"" my husband said. His voice was so calm it scared me.

My first ex looked uncomfortable. My second ex kept glancing at the door. They clearly didn't want to be there.

My husband pulled out his phone. ""I've been documenting everything. Every lie she told me about where she was going. Every time she came home smelling like someone else. Every text message she thought I didn't see.""

He turned to them. ""Did either of you know she's married?""

My first ex stood up immediately. ""Wait, what? You said you were divorced.""

""I told you we were separated,"" I said.

""That's not what you said,"" my second ex snapped. ""You said your divorce was finalized six months ago.""

My husband laughed. It wasn't a happy sound. ""She's been lying to all of us. But here's the thing, I'm not sharing anything. I'm done.""

He handed me an envelope. Divorce papers. Already filed.

""You can have them both now. Or neither. I don't care anymore.""

My first ex grabbed his jacket. ""I'm not getting involved in this mess. This is insane.""

My second ex looked at me like I was a stranger. ""You're actually crazy. I have a girlfriend. I thought you were single and we were just casually dating.""

They both left. Just walked out.

My husband packed a bag that night and went to stay with his brother. The next day his entire family blocked me. My own sister called me selfish when she found out. My parents said they were disappointed.

I tried reaching out to both exes to explain. The first one blocked me immediately. The second one sent me a long message calling me a manipulative psycho who tried to ruin his relationship. He said he told his girlfriend everything and she forgave him but he never wants to hear from me again.

I'm sitting in this house alone now. The divorce is moving forward. My husband won't talk to me except through his lawyer. He told our mutual friends everything and they all sided with him. Even his coworkers who I thought liked me have unfriended me on social media.

I lost my husband. I lost both guys. I lost my friends. My family barely speaks to me.

I thought I was just being honest about my needs. I thought he'd either accept it or we'd figure something out together. I never expected him to blow up my entire life like this.

Was I really that wrong for wanting more?

I’m a 26F who moved countries and found herself in good enough group of people to hang out with. One of them is a 23F, let’s call her Z. I met at the house party of M. I was in a phase of actively trying to make friends, so I was reaching out to people for one-on-one meetups. I asked her, she agreed, and she even followed up a week later. We ended up hanging out the entire day instead of just for coffee. I had a great time and found her to be quirky, lively, and sweet; she reminded me of a friend from back home.

As fellow expats, we bonded over our experiences. We spent a lot of time together, both in group settings with our mutual friends and just the two of us. For a year, things were great, and I was genuinely happy to have found a good friend.

Then, this summer, we decided to go on a girls trip with four of us. That's when the glass shattered for me, and I don’t know if I'm overthinking it, if I should talk to her, or just let it go.

Here’s what happened on the four-day trip:

Unequal Treatment: 
I noticed she acted completely differently around our mutual friend, M. Every joke M made was hilarious, but every joke I made was ""offensive,"" ""cancelable,"" or worse. There were instances where M made the exact same joke the next day, and she found it hilarious.

Dismissiveness and Condescension: 
She would roll her eyes and correct me over mundane things. For example, I suggested taking the LRT to a restaurant, and she rolled her eyes saying, ""Why the fuck would we do that when we can just call a cab?"" 

Disrespect for My Belongings: 
I mentioned my beach sandals were from the dollar store just for the trip. The next day, she asked to wear them. When I asked what I would wear, her excuse was that since I don't swim, I shouldn't care, but since they looked nice with her dress, I should let her wear them. I reluctantly agreed, planning to wear sneakers. When the sandals didn't fit her, I warned her they would hurt her feet and get bent out of shape. She replied, ""I'll give you the four dollars you spent on these."" 

Backhanded Comments: 
Z wanted to wear my white T-shirt, and I said sure. She wore it backwards to make it look good, asked where I got it, and when I said a wholesale store, she replied, ""Oh, that's why it's itchy."" (The tag would itch anyone wearing a shirt the wrong way, but okay.)

""Dibs"" Don't Apply to Me: 
She called dibs on everything, and her dibs were respected. If I called dibs on anything, it meant nothing. Our other friend, P, noticed this and even called her out on it. 

One-Upping and Questionable Ailments: 
It sounds bitchy, but she seems to have every mental and physical health problem anyone else mentions. When M asked how I was dealing with my PCOS (a lifelong, manageable condition), she said, ""Oh, I had that too, but I fixed it."" When another friend mentioned being on disability after an accident, Z suddenly had also been on disability. She claims to have BPD, ADHD, PCOS (which she ""fixed""), and a sunlight allergy—though she had no problem at the beach. The allergy only became a problem when I bought the last sun hat, which she then asked me to give her because of her condition. 
I could go on and on. 

Conversations: 
the entire time the conversation were her looking up guys in hinge/bumble etc and asking us if they are good enough for her, and also talking about her exs and the side pieces - I didn’t even know she had so much boy problem cz we only/mostly talked about life and stuff…men came up but not the extent that it seemed like that was her personality…Also P’s friend had an issue with her too after she hung out with Z and P when brought it up Z said that P’s friend was being just an insecure bitch and needs to heal her self, cz not everyone wants her crusty man… (P’s friend’s man was repeatedly flirting with Z and she explained it out as “that’s how boys are around me” -ik he’s at fault but she is too for entertaining him imo) 

Other Dynamics I Noticed:
Friend M enabled her behavior and then acted innocent. Friend P was visibly annoyed with her and later confided in me that she had noticed this pattern on a previous trip with this girl as well. At the airport at the end of the trip, Z said to me, ""I'm sorry I was a bitch on the trip; I was just overstimulated."" I just said, ""It happens,"" and went home.

I have been avoiding any potential drama, so Iv been playing it cool with the group, and especially Z for two months, however I have avoided seeing her for a month now, making up excuses to not hang out especially for 1-1 hangouts saying I’m busy with chores etc. (however Iv been hanging out with P) 
The last straw for me was when Z put her birthday dinner on my birthday weekend. She said that her birthday weekend was booked with her family celebrating her, so she chose this weekend. I let her know that it was my birthday weekend and I won’t be available to attend her party but she should go ahead and have fun. In response to this she responded “Right”…and proceeded to remove me from insta and snap. I was on a weekend trip with my husband when I realised my snaps were not going through to her, upon checking I saw she had removed me from snap. Later that night she added me back. Removed me again the next day. Added me back 2 days later. This removing and adding back got so much that I had to take a photo from a different phone to see if have proof that this actually happened and I was not just imagining it. At this point I had made up my mind not to give her any reaction as it seemed like she wanted me to confront her so she could become the victim. So far I have played it very casual. 
Then things got a little messy when I asked the group as a whole to come join us for brunch, and because of clash of timings for M and P’s boyfriend couldn’t make it so it got postponed. We took S and her man; another friend of ours, out to our reservation at that restaurant for brunch on the same day and time. (I had posted about us being there with them on snap)
M arrives there 30 mins later with her husband. We’re there with our other friends enjoying brunch. I see M, say hello to her, she’s very dismissive and starts talking to the waiter. I stay with my guests while my husband goes to Ms man and says hello. Things get weird after that; M deletes some text off of snap that she had sent me before I could read it. My husband tells me M snapped at the waiter saying the food looks “sad” and told her man she’ll be on the car waiting. Her man took take out and they left… i dont know what upset her so much? That we went to a reservation they couldn’t go to with a different group of friends? I dont know why it matters. 
Anyways. 
A week goes by, I notice change in M and Zs behaviour. I didn’t want to have a spat or a conflict so text in the group the week before that we should have that postponed brunch this coming weekend; to which Z says “ count me out” while M said “she’s avoiding eating out” - that’s fine I expected nothing much from them anyways. But then instead of responding if they can make it or not P texts in the same sms group that I texted saying “I forgot this group chat even existed” - nothing afterwards. After that point I had moved on from all of these people, while P and I would occasionally talk. 

My birthday rolls around and P texts me that she wants to take me out. Her and her man invite me and my husband to a cafe where we have a really nice time tbh. But 2 things seemed weird to me: P asked me questions about what is going on in my life in a way that felt like she was snooping for something. She repeatedly asked about my friend S and if I had know her for a long time and if she’s a close friend. Which I found really weird. And she was looking at my travelling photos and came across of the photo I took of Z 
Removing and adding me back on snap and then removing me again…(I had forgotten that it was even there tbh) P scrolled past it and didn’t say a word. She gave me a gift and we ended our night

I am invited to P’s birthday party coming weekend, since P and I have stayed in touch and whenever we meet it’s pleasant enough, I have decided to go. However i do not know if that is a wise thing to do or not because Z and M will be there aswell. 
No part of me wants to get into the nitty gritty of why I stoped associating with Z but i dont know if ghosting completely is fair to her either. Should I let her know how I feel? Should I just part ways? I’ve thought about talking to her about her behavior, but she gave me a vibe that she would smear my name.

AITA for dealing with it this way? Should I address it or just quietly exit?",2,1759517842.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1nx7syb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Discussion/comments/1nx7syb/some_of_the_easter_eggs_found_in_the_prophecy/,"Some of the Easter eggs found in ""The Prophecy""","Recently, I finished replaying ""The Prophecy."" And once again, I was amazed by what a masterpiece of a quest it is from every angle.

Besides its many other virtues, it's also full of various allusions. I decided to share some of them.

I've taken screenshots of all the game quotes mentioned below, though they're in my native language. I'll be happy to show them if anyone would like to see.

# - The Easter eggs I'm sure about:

**\*   \*\*You’ll never walk alone.\*\***

A song by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II for the musical ""Carousel."" The anthem for Liverpool Football Club fans.

**\*   \*\*Proxy is watching a movie. The plot: a girl is kidnapped from her wedding by a dragon who can turn into a human. The two fall in love. The dragon is afraid of harming the girl. Meanwhile, she is planning her escape...\*\***

This describes the 2015 Russian fantasy film ""He's a Dragon,"" based on the novel ""Ritual"" by Ukrainian writers Sergey and Marina Dyachenko.

**\*   \*\*In a book, the hero has two fathers. One works for money, the other makes money.\*\***

A reference to Robert T. Kiyosaki's book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad.""

**\*   \*\*You look at the sky and ponder...\*\***

A reference to Volume 1 of Leo Tolstoy's novel ""War and Peace."" Specifically, the episode where Andrei Bolkonsky, wounded at the Battle of Austerlitz, looks at the sky and contemplates a series of philosophical questions.

**\*   \*\*Waterspouts swirl near the islands under dark clouds and stretch upwards...\*\***

Egghead Island from ""One Piece""?

**\*   \*\*Quantum satellites teleport as soon as you look away...\*\***

A description of quantum theory.

**\*   \*\*A black hole is contained within a star's body.\*\***

According to current astrophysical theory, any star is a future black hole.

**\*   \*\*Fortunately, you don't have a mood stat, otherwise it would surely have dropped.\*\***

The developers are joking about themselves and the mood system that was cut from ZZZ.

**\*   \*\*A man is dressed in a suit, dog hair is stuck to his trouser leg. His weapon almost falls from his hands – he is utterly exhausted. Later, he admits that he dreams of going on vacation with his dog and quitting his job altogether.\*\***

John Wick.

**\*   \*\*Pride grips a branch instead of a sword.\*\***

For example, Meliodas from the manga ""The Seven Deadly Sins"" sometimes wields a branch instead of a sword.

**\*   \*\*A young man doesn't stop biting the nail on his thumb.\*\***

L from ""Death Note.""

**\*   \*\*A man dressed in a black turtleneck looks like an existentialist philosopher.\*\***

Steve Jobs.

**\*   \*\*Buridan: ""If I have to choose between one and the other, I prefer not to choose at all.""\*\***

A reference to Jean Buridan's thought experiment ""Buridan's Ass."" An expression denoting an indecisive person who cannot choose between two completely equal options and ends up taking no action.

**\*   \*\*Wrath and Prudence: a woman in red and a woman in blue are fighting.\*\***

In Kabuki theater, the colors blue and red in \*kumadori\* (makeup) are opposites. Blue signifies calmness/coolness; red, among other things, signifies courage and recklessness. In ZZZ, Wrath is in red, and Prudence is in blue.

**\*   \*\*A man in a billowing robe with a blissful smile on his face. Judging by his expression, he is under the influence of some substances.\*\***

Tyler Durden from Fincher's ""Fight Club.""

**\*   \*\*You see a girl in a school uniform with her hair in two pigtails. The girl blushes. And then she declares that she doesn't like the boy who recently transferred to their school one bit.\*\***

This is a reference to the popular anime trope of the \*tsundere\*. They often have two pigtails. Examples include Asuka from ""Evangelion"" and Eri from ""School Rumble.""

**\*   \*\*An utterly unremarkable high school boy, wherever he goes, attracts attention and makes everyone he meets fall in love with him. Even the Ethereals fight over him.\*\***

A parody of the standard manga and anime hero, the romantic comedy protagonist.

**\*   \*\*""Let go of my hand! I'll get pregnant!""\*\***

In the anime fan community, there's a widespread joke that holding hands is an extremely lewd act that can even lead to pregnancy. It's presumed the meme arose due to strange censorship in anime, where even intertwined fingers were pixelated.

**\*   \*\*Lust: ""I will continue to act friendly towards all the cute girls!""\*\***

Rentaro from ""The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You.""

**\*   \*\*The blacksmith Vulcan dreams of creating perfect armor.\*\***

Vulcan is the Roman god of blacksmithing.

**\*   \*\*If you bump heads with another snake, something bad doesn't necessarily have to happen. Try it yourself.\*\***

The developers added hints on how to play the arcade games in ZZZ.

# - I think I have a guess...

**\*   \*\*You want to get home quickly. This gives you strength.\*\***

A common phrase that hardly seems like an Easter egg. However, combined with another reference we'll touch on later, the phrase becomes an Easter egg.

**\*   \*\*Drinking water restores health. However, there's a note: ""Can a hero really save the world by sipping water? Will he manage to save anyone? Don't even hope.""\*\***

I see this as a reference to ""One Piece."" Luffy restored his health and saved himself from the heat with water in the 200s chapters of the manga. And later, as we know, he didn't save everyone...

**\*   \*\*Manga heroes manage to turn stones into smooth spheres. Perhaps one day you will too.\*\***

Possibly a reference to ""Dragon Ball.""

**\*   \*\*There** **is nothing in the Hollow that you could call a hearty meal. So you try to imagine a bowl made of air in your hand - and a table made of air before you.\*\***

The sudden appearance of a table with luxurious dishes might be a reference to the Genie's song from Disney's ""Aladdin."" But I'd like to believe that the visualization of a sumptuous dish materializing out of thin air in virtual reality is a reference to the Strugatsky brothers' ""The Final Circle of Paradise"".

**\*   \*\*You punch quickly, then brew coffee and sit on a rock.\*\***

Seems similar to Master Roshi from ""Dragon Ball.""

**\*   \*\*A young gentleman with a gold-plated tooth. He is dressed in a flashy outfit, and an expensive watch adorns his wrist.\*\***

Aventurine (HSR)! Just kidding. Maybe it's a reference to the villain from ""John Wick"": he has gold teeth, a watch, is expensively dressed, but isn't young. Possibly a reference to rapper culture in general. They get gold teeth, wear flashy clothes and large wristwatches.

**\*   \*\*Someone named Toto, who was absent from the quest's plot and appeared only at the very end, doesn't understand what's happening.\*\***

Probably a reference to L. Frank Baum's ""The Wizard of Oz."" Dorothy's dog was named Toto. They initially don't understand what's happening or where they are. And most importantly, they really wanted to go home. Remember that Easter egg about wanting to get home quickly? Perhaps it and Toto are two parts of a single reference.

# - I actually have no idea...

**\*   \*\*You want to play the game ""Strange Companion,"" but you can't get it to start. Maybe it's a pirated copy. What a strange name for a game.\*\***

Probably a direct reference to some horror story about a computer game called ""Strange Companion,"" where after playing it, the characters are pursued by that very companion. But the closest thing I found is the 2006 film ""Stay Alive."" Anyone who plays the video game is pursued by the ghost of the Blood Countess. In the ZZZ Easter egg, it's mentioned that the game wouldn't start, supposedly because it's a pirated copy. I assume that the fact it's a ""pirated"" copy saved our Proxy from future pursuit by the strange companion.

**\*   \*\*Eos takes off her scarf and tries to use it as a jump rope.\*\***

Most likely, this is a reference to a common trope in wuxia, where heroes can use scarves, long sleeves or shawls as weapons: to deflect arrows or even as whips. However, the only thing that came to my mind was the history of rhythmic gymnastics, where in the early days of the sport, athletes performed with, among other things, a shawl as a prop. The shawl is no longer used in rhythmic gymnastics, but the rope and ribbon are.

**\*   \*\*You're doing parkour in some old ruins and accidentally break a window. It's clean... too clean.\*\***

This episode is obviously a reference to some movie or anime where the characters realize that a seemingly abandoned building is probably inhabited. I don't know any such films. Maybe one of you can remember a suitable one.

**\*   \*\*You open a cached video about good posture and watch it carefully.\*\***

I screenshotted this episode because I thought it was a reference to the webtoon ""Viral Hit"" (""Kenka Dokugaku""). But it seems the martial arts master v-tuber there didn't make a tutorial video specifically about posture.

**\*   \*\*In the middle of a hand-to-hand fight, you suddenly lie down on the ground to rest.\*\***

I thought I'd seen such a move in one of Jackie Chan's movies. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's not an Easter egg at all.

**\*   \*\*Three brothers are great swordsmen. The eldest went into a Hollow and disappeared. The youngest is the epitome of modesty. He has an extremely low opinion of his own abilities, although all enemies fear him. The middle brother (Pride) is a long-haired handsome man – the greatest swordsman. He unsuccessfully searches for a worthy sword and a worthy opponent.** >!**At the end of the quest, they find the remains of the eldest brother, hinting that he is the very First Hero, whom the Prophet previously lured into the Hollow, and he became the Ethereal we fight. Pride picks up his elder brother's sword and delivers the decisive blow, securing victory.\*\***!<

Perhaps this isn't a reference, but the actual quest plot. Perhaps it's a parody of popular tropes in shonen and wuxia. I suppose the whole family situation could be a direct reference to some work. It only reminds me of ""InuYasha."" Where the handsome elder brother is considered the best swordsman and wants to get his younger brother's sword. Eventually, he gets his own.",17,1759517662.0,ZZZ_Discussion,3,1.0,False

1nx7siv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nx7siv/how_i_stumbled_into_a_freelance_gig_that_pays_me/,How I Stumbled Into a Freelance Gig That Pays Me Monthly (n8n Automation for Recruitment),"Alright so this is part success story, part ""how did I get so lucky"" story.

I've been freelancing for about a year doing random automation projects - mostly helping small businesses stop doing repetitive crap manually. Nothing crazy, just a guy with too much time on his hands who learned n8n thru youtube/tutorials.

# How I Found This Client

So I'm at a coffee shop in August, minding my own business, working on my laptop. The guy next to me is literally losing his mind on a phone call. I hear him say something like ""we're spending 4 hours a day just FINDING companies to reach out to, this is insane.""

When he hangs up, I couldn't help myself. I'm like ""Hey man, sorry for eavesdropping, but did you say you're manually searching for leads?"" Turns out he runs a small recruitment agency - him and 3 other people. They were drowning in manual work and had basically zero budget for expensive software.

I told him I might be able to help, we grabbed lunch the next day, and boom - I had a client.

# What They Needed

These guys were stuck in 2015:

* Manually checking job boards multiple times a day
* Copy-pasting company info into spreadsheets
* Sending cold emails one by one
* Forgetting to follow up with warm leads
* Zero automation. Like, none.

The owner (Mike) told me their biggest bottleneck was just FINDING good prospects. By the time they'd contact a company, they'd already hired or gone with another agency.

# What I Built For Them

I pitched him a simple automation system. Nothing fancy, just n8n workflows that would do the grunt work. He was skeptical at first (kept asking if I needed to install software on their computers lol) but I showed him my portfolio and he agreed to a trial.

Here's what the system does:

**Lead Generation Workflow:**

* Scrapes major job boards every 6 hours (Indeed, LinkedIn, some niche tech boards)
* Filters for their target roles (tech & finance, mid-to-senior level)
* Pulls company details and enriches them using Clearbit
* Scores each lead based on company size, number of openings, hiring patterns

**Outreach Automation:**

* Generates personalized email templates (company name, role details, etc.)
* Sends initial outreach emails automatically
* For high-value leads (big companies, multiple openings), sends the team a Slack alert to do manual outreach
* Auto-follows up after 3 days if no response
* Tracks opens and clicks

**CRM Integration:**

* Everything flows into their Airtable (they didn't have a CRM so we just used this)
* Creates tasks when someone replies
* Tracks metrics so they can see what's working

# The Results (And Why They Keep Paying Me)

So initially this was supposed to be a one-time project. Build it, hand it over, peace out. But here's what happened:

**After 6 weeks:**

* They went from \~20 leads per week to 60-70
* Their response rate actually IMPROVED (15% vs 8%) because they were reaching out faster
* They closed 2 new clients that came directly through the system
* Mike and his team were saving like 10-15 hours per week COMBINED

Mike calls me and goes ""dude, I need you to maintain this and keep improving it."" So now I have a monthly retainer where I:

* Monitor the workflows and fix issues
* Adjust filters as their target market changes
* Add new job boards when they enter new sectors
* Optimize the email templates based on response rates

It's only like 5-8 hours of work per month but it's steady income, which is rare in freelancing. Plus they refer me to other agencies now.

# What I Learned From This

**1. Coffee shops are networking goldmines** \- I know everyone says this but seriously, I wasn't even trying to find clients that day.

**2. Small businesses are desperate for automation** \- They don't need fancy AI or complicated systems. They just need to stop doing the same task 100 times a day.

**3. Monthly retainers > one-time projects** \- I used to just build and bail. Now I always pitch ongoing maintenance/optimization. Way better for cash flow.

**4. Make it idiot-proof** \- These guys aren't technical. I built a simple dashboard where they can see what's working and pause workflows if needed. No code touching required.

**5. Start with a pilot** \- I didn't charge them much for the first month. Proved the ROI, then they were happy to pay ongoing.

# The Tech Stack (For Anyone Curious)

* n8n (self-hosted on DigitalOcean, $5/month droplet)
* Airtable for their ""CRM""
* Gmail API for sending emails
* Clearbit for company enrichment (free tier initially, they upgraded later)
* Various HTTP requests for scraping
* Slack for notifications
* Simple password-protected dashboard I built so they can monitor everything

# The Money Part

Since people always ask - I charged them $2k for the initial build (took me about 15-20 hours) and now I get $500/month for maintenance and improvements. Not life-changing money, but it covers my rent and gives me freedom to be picky with other projects.

Plus Mike's referred me to 2 other recruitment agencies. Currently building similar systems for them.

# Advice If You Want to Do Something Similar

* **Find industries stuck in manual hell** \- Recruitment, real estate, staffing, agencies... they're all ripe for this
* **Learn one tool really well** \- I could've used Zapier or Make, but n8n is free and powerful
* **Talk to people IRL** \- I know we're all introverts but my best clients came from random conversations
* **Show, don't tell** \- I built Mike a tiny demo in 2 hours before our second meeting. That's what sold him.
* **Think retainer, not project** \- Systems need maintenance. Position yourself as ongoing support.

Anyway, that's my story. Happy to answer questions about n8n, freelancing, or whatever.

First possible error: I used somewhat OLD oats, not organic. (Bob's Red Mill steel cut, have prepared for oatmeal in the past with no taste issues. These were soaked overnight and rinsed.)

Second possible error: blended too long at 45 seconds.

I also had a quarter cup of cashews in, as I'd seen several recipes that suggested this to make the oat milk nice and creamy. The milk did come out creamy when drunk plain.

I DID use COLD, filtered water.

At any rate, the result, sweetened with a single tablespoon of maple syrup, plus a teaspoon of good vanilla extract, was NOT nice in my cold brew. BITTER tasting. Which isn't the cold brew, as I regularly drink that black with no taste issues. Nor is it the vanilla extract, which I also regularly use in my nut and seed plant milks. The cashews are fine eaten plain and can't be considered a culprit either. 

I added another tablespoon of maple syrup to the prepared oat milk and shook it up really well and tried in a second cup of coffee. STILL *somewhat* bitter. 

So, after that, I tasted a cup of the oat milk BY ITSELF. Oddly, that wasn't bad at all! It does kind of have a chalky texture. But drinkable and tasted fine!

Something about the combo of my cold brew coffee and the oat milk wasn't working.

It could well be the oats themselves that were the issue. I have about a cup left, and will toss them. I'm not invested in perfecting an oat milk recipe, given that my nut and seed milks in the Nama M1 have always come out lovely. But having the oats in the pantry, I thought I'd make the experiment, since Black Friday and sales on the M1 are just around the corner.

MY experience above does NOT, in ANY WAY, mean that you can't make a great oat milk in the M1! 

I'm certain one COULD make a VERY nice oat milk with this machine, but BEFORE purchasing the machine JUST for the purpose of making oat milk, I'd suggest perfecting your oat milk recipe to your liking with a blender FIRST. ",1,1759517617.0,Juicing,1,1.0,False

I've been wanting to visit the garden anyway, so I'm thinking of making a day of it. I'd love to have company and maybe get coffee or something! Now for a little more about myself:

# About Me:

Like Bilbo Baggins, I aspire to a life of tea, books, too much good food, and the occasional adventure. Unlike Bilbo, I also aspire not to die a bachelor.

*My life story so far*: I grew up on a farm in coastal Virginia with my head stuck in books instead of on what was in front of me. I still haven't grown out of that to be honest. After a failed stint as a traveling archaeologist, I moved back home and still live there. Today I work at a little rural library helping elderly people log into their email and abusing my authority to keep renewing the books I have checked out. It's kind of like embezzling except I don't get any money out of it. It's a decent job. I'm not sure if I want to do it forever but it works for now. I'm not really a career-oriented person.

In my free time I read books, watch YouTube documentaries, maintain a pollinator garden, and play video games. I also love to cook, with Moroccan, Indian, and Greek being my favorite cuisines to experiment with. My favorite book so far this year has been *The Stronghold* by Dino Buzzati. Mycenaeans and Hittites, Greeks and Romans, Saxons and Norsemen dance in my head. I think someday I might like to write a novel. I would also like to see a moose.

*Games I play:* The Long Dark, Civilization 6 & 7, Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Age of Mythology, Settlers of Catan; I will also play any board or card game

*Shows I like:* Andor, House of the Dragon, The Sopranos, open to suggestions

*Current mood:* ""Dreams sometimes free us from life. They are the sunshine behind the world. We lie down to sleep at the end of a January evening, the north wind shakes the house, the thin windowpanes tremble, we close our eyes and the sun shines on us.""

[Here's a picture of me](https://i.imgur.com/K69DouD.jpeg) on Mt. Olympus, blissfully unaware that I will soon experience mild altitude sickness

# What I'm looking for:

In the grandest sense a partner and a confidant - someone who redoubles my joy from eating a good meal or seeing the wind in the grass on a rainy day. Life's a journey and I'd like to share the road.

I realize I'm not likely to find that by poasting though, so on a smaller scale I'd also be glad just to make some friends. Do you think playing something absentmindedly and bullshitting about Tolkien or Star Wars or bronze age geopolitics sounds fun? Send me a chat or message!

One last thing - if you support the current US government is any way we won't get along. Family and friends of mine are in the crosshairs of this administration. You either value human dignity or you don't.",1,1759517596.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1nx7rqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nx7rqs/standing_desk_vs_adjustable_chair_which_one_fits/,Standing desk vs adjustable chair: which one fits better?,"Hey everyone! I've been working from home for the past couple of years, and I've noticed a significant increase in back pain and overall discomfort. Like many of you, I spent countless hours researching the best solution for my home office setup. The big question was: should I invest in a standing desk or an ergonomic adjustable chair?

After months of testing both options, I want to share my honest experience with you all.

Let's start with standing desks. I initially bought one from this seller (https://athometouch.com/standing-desk), and it completely changed my work routine. The ability to switch between sitting and standing throughout the day helped improve my posture and energy levels. I found myself being more productive, especially during those afternoon slumps when I'd usually reach for another coffee.

However, standing all day isn't the answer either. That's where the debate with adjustable chairs comes in. A good ergonomic chair provides crucial support during those longer sitting sessions, particularly during intense focus work or video calls.

Here's what I've learned:

Standing Desk Pros:
- Reduces sedentary behavior
- Improves posture and core strength
- Helps with energy levels
- Great for quick meetings and brainstorming
- Can help with back pain

Standing Desk Cons:
- Initial adjustment period
- Can be tiring if used too much
- More expensive than regular desks
- Takes up more space

Adjustable Chair Pros:
- Better for long focus sessions
- More comfortable for most people
- Generally less expensive
- Easier transition from traditional setup

Adjustable Chair Cons:
- Still promotes sitting
- Quality ones can be pricey
- May not help with energy levels

My solution? I actually use both! I got my standing desk from here (https://athometouch.com/standing-desk) and paired it with a decent adjustable chair. This combination gives me the flexibility to switch positions throughout the day based on my tasks and energy levels.

For those wondering about cost vs. benefit, I found that investing in both has actually saved me money in the long run - fewer massage appointments and less need for pain medication. Plus, my productivity has increased significantly.

The key is finding what works for your specific situation. Consider your work style, available space, and budget. If you can only choose one, I'd recommend starting with a standing desk because it gives you the option to use both regular chairs and standing positions.

Remember, the best setup is one that encourages movement and position changes throughout the day. Don't feel pressured to stand all day just because you have a standing desk, or sit all day just because you have an expensive chair.

I just got back from my coffee date with one of the girls from Pi Beta Phi! I went early this morning — the recruitment chair couldn’t make it since she had class, but I still got to sit down and talk with one of the members, which was really nice.

I tried my best to keep the conversation going and answer any questions she had. She shared a lot about the house — how things work, how the rooms are set up, and some fun stuff like Big/Little and having a twin. We also talked about hobbies and just got to know each other a bit, which helped me feel more comfortable as we chatted.

Something that really meant a lot to me she actually paid for my drink, which was so thoughtful! I was really grateful for that small gesture, and it honestly made the experience feel even more welcoming.

Afterward, I texted the recruitment chair to thank her for setting everything up. I let her know I had such a fun time, that everyone has been so sweet, and that I’m really excited to keep getting to know the chapter! :)

As for Delta Zeta, I haven’t heard anything back yet, so I guess it’s the waiting game for now. Still staying hopeful and just trying to enjoy each step of the process.

WARNING VERY LONG.,"Some context for you guys, my(27f) parents (56m/56f) have always had a health marriage with minimal fights, understanding conversations, and no mention of divorce or separation. Until around the initial bomb dropping on their marriage in 2015 i believe. This catastrophic event led to where they’re at currently. 

Lets call my dad D for dad and mom M for mom, easy peasy. 
In 2015(again estimated) M had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Through this time she went through radiation treatment, she stayed in bed a lot of the time because of how terrible she felt, but she still went to work. After her radiation appointments D would bring her a frozen coffee as a little treat to cheer her up every time without fail. 

During this time M and i didnt talk much as she wanted to rest and that’s completely understandable. However, D wanted to talk more about his own struggles through this difficult time. Mind you I was a teenager still in high school. These conversations between me and D got really deep, he insisted on telling me how difficult it was on him emotionally because he feels like she doesn’t love him as much anymore. Reluctantly telling me that they do not engage in intimate things either because of her current illness. Every time were alone together he saw it fit to strike up a conversation venting about M and their current situation, how its straining their marriage etc. 

Fast forward to almost 6-7 months after M’s diagnosis, the reckoning. I arrived home from school like any other day to find D in the dining room with a bag packed crying. As i approached, D stated repeatedly how he fucked up and have to leave. He very loosely stated that he had cheated on M. Before she arrived home for work he was gone. 

When M had arrived it was almost as if nothing happened. We made dinner together, ate, talked, everything was… normal? That was until about 8-9 pm when i heard M crying from her room. I went to her door and knocked asking to come in. She allowed me to come sit and talk with her. We chatted for what seemed to be hours about D’s wrongdoings. In this time i found it was not only once but THREE TIMES total that cheated on her via phone during her radiation treatments. 

I consoled M for about a week or two by myself as I was the only one of her kids consistently there for her. A’s(brother)wife had blocked all contact with M there was no way to reach A. A and W had an extremely toxic decade long marriage mostly due to W’s disorders and several self exit attempts. J(other brother) was getting a stat on his new career and life 9 hours away from home so he was hardly ever available to talk. Through this i was the only (and youngest) person staying with her through it and helping her. The separation lasted about two weeks or so. 

FAST FORWARD TO NOW. After they got back together everything seemed fine and their marriage started to flourish again. Until about 2022 when M developed a new disorder that caused her to be unable to work and really do anything. In 2020 M and D had gotten covid. M got extremely sick when she had covid and now has a different disorder from that. I cant remember the exact name but she has blephrospasms (?) in her face like crazy. She gets botox shots once every three months to help otherwise she cannot keep her eyes open at all. 

A moved back home as his wife officially self exited successfully, it was a very difficult time for our whole family. J started communicating with M less later the be revealed that J’s wife holds animosity towards M. This makes the rest of our family including A think that J is being manipulated and is not talking to M or really any of us due to his wife P. 

The cycle is starting all over again and seems very similar to the one prior. This time D hasn’t done anything as far as anyone knows. Openly admits to his fault and is consistently providing reassurance in any way he can to ensure M he is not cheating. Phone passwords, email passwords, has zero social media. M insists D is cheating because why wouldn’t he this time? 

M traps me into conversations almost nightly about the assumed cheating from D, these conversations lasted about two hours each for an entire year. The house was very tense, the air was thick with resentment from M. It was difficult being my own moms therapist whilst begging her to go talk to a therapist. I find it difficult now to console her as I feel so emotionally worn down now from previous efforts. 

M started going to therapy and suggested marriage counseling to D. He agreed and was happy to go but nothing ever came of it. D is not the smartest but he tries his best. 

This week was it. Allegedly there were screaming matches and heated discussions. I do not know how it was as i am now engaged and in a home of my own with my fiancé. They separated Monday because M stated she “is done”. D packed a bag and headed back to his parents home for a little while. He called me to ask me to write him a resume as he doesn’t believe he is literate enough. D is retired but now needs 4 credits to continue retirement. M is on disability due to her condition and is staying in the home paid for by D. 

D is distraught and upset at himself for what he did in the past. M is feeling lost and confused on what the right decision is for her. I feel tired of being their marriage counselor and also seeing them in this emotional rollercoaster. What can I do to help either one separately or help them to see they need to seek counseling? I know it’s not my place but neither one of them will sit with their feelings long enough to figure anything out leading to two hour long phone calls with me and i cannot handle that again. 

Any and all insight is greatly appreciated thank you, and sorry for such a long post. ",1,1759517259.0,ACOD,1,1.0,False
1nx7mbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1nx7mbk/feeling_starvation_247_despite_more_than_enough/,Feeling Starvation 24/7 Despite More Than Enough Calories,"Hi all! I desperately need nutritional advice because I think something is deeply wrong with me, or at least wrong with the way I eat. I also plan to consult a dietician through my university's wellness services btw, I'm not purely relying on Reddit to fix this issue.

I'm a 21 year old female, petite (5'1"") and weighing 109.0lbs as of this afternoon. I'm asking for advice because I constantly feel insatiable hunger and obsess over food to the point of crying, despite eating **more than enough** calories throughout the day. This summer, I totally let myself go, constantly overeating, gorging on unhealthy foods, never tracking any calories or macros, and enjoying tons of sweets without a care in the world. But this fall, I am LOCKING IN!!! My goals in my fitness/diet journey are:

1. Remove **added** sugar from my diet and enter a ""sugar detox"" ***until*** the incessant cravings for sugar and sweets go away, then I can slowly introduce sugar and enjoy the occasional treat (i.e 1-2 times a week, like a pastry with friends at a coffeeshop) without obsessing over sugar, craving it, crying because I can't have it, and binging it. *Caveats to the sugar detox (which I have been following since September 2nd, i.e. almost a whole month as I'm posting this on October 1st, with only 2 slip-ups (binges)) are:*
   1. I am still eating fruit (attempting to use it to help replace/reduce some of my sugar cravings) and today I ate a protein bar labelled ""no added sugar"" but it apparently had sugar alcohols in it, which I'm also trying to avoid so fuck my life i guess
   2. I am drinking and occasionally eating copious amounts of fake sweeteners (and no, I will not consider cutting these out of my diet)-- Coke Zero, energy drinks, and iced coffee with sugar-free syrup are consumed on an at-least-once (usually 2-3 times per day) basis-- but at least they're low in calories!
2. Focusing on eating healthier by consuming ""whole foods"" rather than highly processed foods. Some examples of (non-sugary, but tend to contain added sugar which means I couldn't have them anyways) foods I am attempting to reduce my intake of (although again- I constantly crave, shed tears over, and overall my life feels incomplete without these foods) are: *Kraft dinner, pretzels, chips, popcorn, tortilla chips, processed carbs (i.e. white bread, bagels, hamburger/hot dog buns, rolls, pastries), french fries, grilled cheese sandwiches, fried foods (like dumplings, spring rolls, etc*), *and many many many more......*
3. I used an online calorie calculator to get a starting point of how many calories I should be eating in a day. It recommended 2,066 calories to maintain my weight and 1,814 to lose 0.5lb per week. My personal goal is really just to not gain weight, and to possibly slim down a little bit. I settled on 1,900 calories as my ""magic number"", which is actually a LOT for someone who's 5'1"" and 100lbs. I input my age, weight, gender, and height correctly and I noted my assumed activity level as “VERY” (moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise 6-7 days a week). I will discuss my workouts later.

My problem is that despite eating to the very edge of my 1,900 calorie limit, I constantly feel hungry to the point of starvation and obsess over food. I feel dissatisfied with my quality of life and the constant hunger and thinking about food is distracting me from my schoolwork (I am in my 4th year at Queen's University in Canada), my sport (I'm on the novice Artistic Swimming team), and impacting my ability to take part in activities that involve food (which creates awkward social interactions). I honestly feel like I ate LESS calories BEFORE I started tracking my calories (at least my day didn't revolve around food and eating, even if the quality of food I was eating was crap).

To figure out where I'm going wrong, here are my last 3 days of eating, and my workouts for the week (to explain me putting my activity level as ""very"" and possibly unlock clues to my obsessive hunger). The 7 days of workouts is from September 21-27. I don't eat breakfast because I'd rather have the calories later in the day.

**WORKOUTS:**  
September 25: Swim workout (synchro practice)  
September 26: Swim workout; Run (5.06km, 5.05min/km, 25min45s)

Beverages- 2 Coke Zero (**0cal**)

I got drunk (on rum with Coke Zero) and binged uncontrollably yesterday (October 2nd) on sugar and processed foods, probably eating over 4000 calories of pure crap-- granola bars, dairy queen, bread with sprinkles, my roommate's frozen cookie dough. This ended a 10 day streak totally sugar free. I feel hopeless, alone, and miserable, but I'm getting back on the bandwagon and tracking again starting today.

Please offer me any advice you may have! I am open to all questions, judgements, and criticisms. I'm honestly desperate for help as my quality of life is rapidly declining.",2,1759517237.0,CICO,14,0.75,False

It is meant as satire and entertainment, not as financial advice, hahaha, enjoy... nor as a factual analysis of Polestar. *Damn, we need to relax during these times when the top 50, or even top 250 lol, are hitting their ATH (all timehigh), and meanwhile PSNY is hitting their ATL (low)!*

Shareholder rage is a thing. If you’ve held PSNY for a while, you probably know the feeling: the stock drops 15% after earnings, another dilution shows up out of nowhere, and suddenly you’re staring at your screen wondering why you didn’t just buy Apple.

https://preview.redd.it/5dc7w54pzxsf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9e02cc118c04574e18d3197ef2ec7f9691c2093

  
But raging doesn’t help the share price, and it definitely doesn’t help your sanity. So here’s my take on how to deal with it ... both in yourself and in other frustrated investors.

  
**Why shareholder rage happens**

It’s not just the red numbers on the screen. It’s the disconnect. Retail investors feel like ghosts most of the time ... invisible, ignored, and powerless. Management is out there talking about design, future models, and “long-term vision,” while your account balance keeps shrinking. Add in daily price swings and scary headlines about cash burn, and it’s no surprise emotions get out of control.

  
**Who gets hit hardest?**

Honestly, anyone can lose it. Traders flip out when they can’t scalp a bounce. Long-term holders (the so-called “diamond hands”) might stay invested, but that doesn’t mean they’re calm ... they just rage quietly. Retail investors usually take it the hardest, especially when analysts predict bankruptcy for the tenth time or when we see dilution right after being told “we’re funded.”

  
How to calm yourself down

A few tricks I’ve learned (or at least tell myself when the red candles show up):

* **Catch it early**: If you’re refreshing Yahoo Finance like it’s Instagram, that’s a red flag. LOL
* **Make excuses**: Instead of thinking “management is clueless,” maybe imagine they’re just buried under too many model launches at once. hmmmm hmmmm
* **Breathe**: When PSNY dips under a dollar, whisper to yourself: *“It’s only a paper loss.”* (Repeat as needed.) LOL
* **Step away**: Shut down the app, go outside, grab a coffee. Better yet, go test drive a Polestar 3 ... trust me, the car looks way better than the stock chart. HaHaHaHa
* **Stop ruminating**: Don’t replay that dilution announcement in your head a thousand times. It won’t change anything.
* **Be decent**: No need to scream “bagholder” or “Scamstar” in forums. We’re all in the same boat anyway.

***At the end of the day, rage doesn’t move the stock. Deliveries do. So until then, ...***

After that I’m open to suggestions haha.

it wasn’t super awkward the conversation flowed and they are like only a few years older then me so we could relate on topics. 

any ways i wasn’t feeling 100% confident as i walked out but i was not feeling like it went badly ifykwim. i just kinda felt neutral about it.

after i left i saw through the window her writing notes on me (im pretty sure) which i know is normal after these chats but thats when i got like scared.

I then send a follow up thank you email and email is just saying thank you for ur time blah blah blah wtv. and i sent this yesterday afternoon and i still haven’t gotten a response and they usually respond pretty fast. 

okay so my question basically is if I didn’t make a great impression how much would a “informal coffee chat that admissions doesn’t use in the admissions process” actually effect my chances of getting in. or am i overthinking this whole thing…",1,1759517042.0,collegeadvice,2,0.67,False

1nx7et9,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1nx7et9/drink_package_vs_purchasing_alcohol_my_experience/,Drink package vs. purchasing alcohol - my experience,"TLDR: We didn't buy the drink package and we spent about half of the cost on booze. YMMV. 

Lots of pre-cruise research here on Reddit and other google searches about the drink package vs. buying drinks at $14.00 plus auto tip (the average cost of a single drink from what I saw). We sailed Sept 19-26 on Navigator to Mexico.   
  
A bit more info. Wife and I are not HUGE drinkers but we do like to imbibe on vacation. Over seven days we had 28 drinks between us. Some were doubles (at double the price) and some were Happy Hour ($6.00 plus tip). We did three excursions in Mexico so we weren't on the ship the entire cruise and we had to be up early'ish and off the ship three days out of the seven. I would have hated to be hungover on any of the excursions so the nights before the excursions we had one or two drinks and called it a night. We don't drink soda unless it is mixed in a drink so that wasn't a consideration. I drink the free drip coffee, wife bought a coffee card. 

The drink package was $79 pp/per day. There may have been better deals, but that was the lowest I saw but I admit I wasn't tracking it. Basically the package would have been $1106. The 28 drinks were $541. So for us, not worth the package.  The average drink cost was $16.52 which was $14.00 plus $2.52 auto tip. We would have needed to drink 67 drinks during the cruise (1106 / 16.52 = 66.90) to make it ""worth it"" for us. That is like five drinks a day each, every day. We did have five drinks on night six when we didn't have anything going on day 7 but the other nights, three was the max. 

My point here is if you are wondering if you should buy the package, think about how much you drink when you go out for an evening with your significant other. Do you have five drinks each on a regular basis? Or when at home, do you typically have five drinks a night for a week? If so, you would benefit from the package. If not, might not be worth it.

1nx7duo,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1nx7duo/feeling_starvation_247_despite_more_than_enough/,Feeling Starvation 24/7 Despite More Than Enough Calories,"Hi all! I desperately need nutritional advice because I think something is deeply wrong with me, or at least wrong with the way I eat. I also plan to consult a dietician through my university's wellness services btw, I'm not purely relying on Reddit to fix this issue.

I'm a 21 year old female, petite (5'1"") and weighing 109.0lbs as of this afternoon. I'm asking for advice because I constantly feel insatiable hunger and obsess over food to the point of crying, despite eating **more than enough** calories throughout the day. This summer, I totally let myself go, constantly overeating, gorging on unhealthy foods, never tracking any calories or macros, and enjoying tons of sweets without a care in the world. But this fall, I am LOCKING IN!!! My goals in my fitness/diet journey are:

1. Remove **added** sugar from my diet and enter a ""sugar detox"" ***until*** the incessant cravings for sugar and sweets go away, then I can slowly introduce sugar and enjoy the occasional treat (i.e 1-2 times a week, like a pastry with friends at a coffeeshop) without obsessing over sugar, craving it, crying because I can't have it, and binging it. *Caveats to the sugar detox (which I have been following since September 2nd, i.e. almost a whole month as I'm posting this on October 1st, with only 2 slip-ups (binges)) are:*
   1. I am still eating fruit (attempting to use it to help replace/reduce some of my sugar cravings) and today I ate a protein bar labelled ""no added sugar"" but it apparently had sugar alcohols in it, which I'm also trying to avoid so fuck my life i guess
   2. I am drinking and occasionally eating copious amounts of fake sweeteners (and no, I will not consider cutting these out of my diet)-- Coke Zero, energy drinks, and iced coffee with sugar-free syrup are consumed on an at-least-once (usually 2-3 times per day) basis-- but at least they're low in calories!
2. Focusing on eating healthier by consuming ""whole foods"" rather than highly processed foods. Some examples of (non-sugary, but tend to contain added sugar which means I couldn't have them anyways) foods I am attempting to reduce my intake of (although again- I constantly crave, shed tears over, and overall my life feels incomplete without these foods) are: *Kraft dinner, pretzels, chips, popcorn, tortilla chips, processed carbs (i.e. white bread, bagels, hamburger/hot dog buns, rolls, pastries), french fries, grilled cheese sandwiches, fried foods (like dumplings, spring rolls, etc*), *and many many many more......*
3. I used an online calorie calculator to get a starting point of how many calories I should be eating in a day. It recommended 2,066 calories to maintain my weight and 1,814 to lose 0.5lb per week. My personal goal is really just to not gain weight, and to possibly slim down a little bit. I settled on 1,900 calories as my ""magic number"", which is actually a LOT for someone who's 5'1"" and 100lbs. I input my age, weight, gender, and height correctly and I noted my assumed activity level as “VERY” (moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise 6-7 days a week). I will discuss my workouts later.

My problem is that despite eating to the very edge of my 1,900 calorie limit, I constantly feel hungry to the point of starvation and obsess over food. I feel dissatisfied with my quality of life and the constant hunger and thinking about food is distracting me from my schoolwork (I am in my 4th year at Queen's University in Canada), my sport (I'm on the novice Artistic Swimming team), and impacting my ability to take part in activities that involve food (which creates awkward social interactions). I honestly feel like I ate LESS calories BEFORE I started tracking my calories (at least my day didn't revolve around food and eating, even if the quality of food I was eating was crap).

To figure out where I'm going wrong, here are my last 3 days of eating, and my workouts for the week (to explain me putting my activity level as ""very"" and possibly unlock clues to my obsessive hunger). The 7 days of workouts is from September 21-27. I don't eat breakfast because I'd rather have the calories later in the day.

**WORKOUTS:**  
September 25: Swim workout (synchro practice)  
September 26: Swim workout; Run (5.06km, 5.05min/km, 25min45s)  
September 27: Rest day  
September 28: Swim workout (synchro practice); Run (5.07km, 5.15min/km, 26min38s)  
September 29: Swim workout (synchro practice)  
September 30: Swim workout  
October 1: Swim workout

I got drunk (on rum with Coke Zero) and binged uncontrollably yesterday (October 2nd) on sugar and processed foods, probably eating over 4000 calories of pure crap-- granola bars, dairy queen, bread with sprinkles, my roommate's frozen cookie dough. This ended a 10 day streak totally sugar free.  I feel hopeless, alone, and miserable, but I'm getting back on the bandwagon and tracking again starting today. 

Please offer me any advice you may have! I am open to all questions, judgements, and criticisms. I'm honestly desperate for help as my quality of life is rapidly declining.",1,1759516699.0,diet,3,1.0,False

But why is your bed still cold when you’ve been lying there for more than fourteen hours? I’m afraid you might catch a chill.
I have never been this vigilant before, sitting here near your door, sketching the scenery of your room into a goodbye note, so you’ll know what I was doing while you slept. I write a few words, then pause, afraid that the scratch of pen against paper will wake you.
But the curtain by your window keeps making this soft tuk, tuk as the wind flows through the cracks in your window. Has it always sounded like this? Or did you hang it just last night? I don’t know, I never noticed before. You were always the one awake, making a hot cup of coffee when I rose.
You were always lost in something. I always wanted to know about your secrets, the kind buried deep in your chest like sutures, washed again and again by your cold blood. I longed to hold just one of them close, so I could know how it feels to be so close to your heart.
Since I am afraid the day has finally arrived when we will sit together on a bench and the wall before us will cast only a single shadow, I want to part ways with you. My mind is filled with so many what ifs. What if you only loved me because of that sleeplessness in your eyes? What if now that you have finally quenched your sleep, you begin to notice my long nose, my small lips, my old scars and realize the world is a softer, brighter place when you’re with someone who carries joy instead of sorrow?

I suppose I can give you everything in this world except happiness, because there is this chronic melancholy running through my blood. So before you wake into chaos, I want you to sleep a little longer. It may be difficult to understand, but hold on to just this: I am leaving because the last image I want to keep of you is at rest, in peace. I cannot bear to watch you surronded by chaos again.

Goodbye, my love.

Selling my vintage Coffee Gaggia espresso machine – a solid, Italian-made classic that’s built like a tank and still makes fantastic espresso.

I recently gave it a full internal service:

Descaled the boiler and internal lines

Replaced all gaskets and seals

Thoroughly cleaned the group head, portafilter, and baskets

This is a pump-driven machine, not a cheap steam toy – it pulls rich, crema-heavy shots with the right grind and tamp. Super simple to use with dedicated switches for power, brewing, and steam. Comes with the original dual filter baskets and portafilter, and even the original manual.

It’s in great working condition and ready to brew. Perfect for someone who loves espresso and appreciates the quality of older machines.

Feel free to message with questions or to come try it out.

\- \[Format\] 3 panels, stacked vertically (4:5 aspect ratio, 1080x1350)

I work with a small team building an app called **Belong**, and we’ve just launched in Mumbai. The whole idea is to make it easier to meet people and feel part of a community here.

On Belong, you can easily:

* **Join or create local events** (coffee meetups, hikes, book clubs, or add existing events so users can join in)
* **Monetize your skills** if you want to host something (like teaching yoga or a skill workshop).

Most profiles are verified, so you know you’re talking to real people.

Belong is already used by over a million people worldwide, with thousands of meetups happening every week, and we’re excited to start building that same energy in Mumbai 🌆

You can check out the app from the link in the comments**,** or find us on Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/belong.app](https://www.instagram.com/belong.app)

No pressure at all, just wanted to introduce Belong to this community.

1nx75yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1nx75yh/investigate_if_the_best_countertop_ice_maker_from/,Investigate if the best countertop ice maker from Euhomy is worth it,"Testing out the EUHOMY Ice Maker Countertop has been an interesting experience, and as someone perpetually on the hunt for the perfect home appliances, I was genuinely curious to see how it performed in a real-world setting. This ice maker, portable and equipped with a carry handle, claims the ability to produce 26.5 lbs of ice per day, and at first glance, its sleek silver finish gives it a polished, modern look. Of course, no product is perfect, and my review is based on honest daily usage, trying out its features thoroughly.

**Portable Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that stood out to me was the compact and portable design. Weighing in at just about 13.38 lbs and measuring 9.25 x 11.54 x 11.61 inches, it's surprisingly easy to carry around, making it great for camping trips, RV journeys, or simply moving it around the kitchen counter. Its handle feels sturdy and well-integrated with the unit, which is a small but important detail. I’ve taken it on a weekend camping trip, and it perfectly fit into the small storage space of the RV. Not to mention, the silver finish fits right into my modern kitchen, blending seamlessly with other appliances.

**Efficient Ice Production**

This ice maker truly shines in its ice-making speed. Other machines often take ages, but this one can produce nine bullet-shaped ice cubes in about six minutes. I found this not only convenient for hosting small gatherings but also a reliable source of ice for my daily smoothies and iced coffee. The bullet-shaped cubes themselves are well-crafted, smooth, and perfect for drinks without sticking together or scratching your mouth. It’s oddly satisfying to see the perfectly rounded edges of each cube, and they melt slower than expected in beverages.

**Key Benefits**

- Produces ice quickly, offering fresh cubes in just six minutes.
- Compact and portable design with a sturdy handle, suitable for various occasions.
- Ultra-quiet operation with a noise level under 45 dB.
- Bullet-shaped design prevents the cubes from sticking or becoming sharp-edged.
- High 1.2L water tank capacity and ability to produce up to 26.5 lbs of ice per day.

**Smart Features and Usability**

The smart design of this ice maker adds a lot to its appeal. It comes with advanced infrared sensors that light up when the ice basket is full or when water needs replenishing. The ""ICE FULL"" and ""ADD WATER"" indicators made it effortless to maintain. Though its control panel is straightforward, requiring just a couple of steps—filling up water and pressing the ""Ice/Clean"" button—I did miss the presence of more advanced settings for customizing the ice-making process. Still, the one-touch auto-cleaning function made cleanup a breeze. Holding down the ""Ice/Clean"" button for three seconds activates a 30-minute cleaning cycle, which feels almost too luxurious for such a compact device.

**Shortcomings**

- Limited customization options for ice size or shape.
- A bit of water tends to collect at the bottom after prolonged use, so occasional drying is necessary.
- The ice maker doesn’t have a freezer compartment, so the ice cubes start melting eventually if not transferred elsewhere.

**Competing Products**

Comparing this device to other countertop ice makers like the Igloo ICEB26HN or the Frigidaire EFIC452, there are pros and cons. Models such as the Igloo might come with slightly larger capacities or additional ice size options, but their price point is often higher, and portability is not as well-executed. The Frigidaire model, while excellent in freezing performance, tends to operate noisier. What sets the EUHOMY apart is its quieter operation and the well-thought-out handle, which seems like a minor detail but makes a big practical difference. While the lack of customizable settings might be a downside for some, it hits the sweet spot for users desiring ease of use and portability.

**Worth Every Penny**

In terms of affordability, this ice maker offers a balanced price-to-quality ratio. While it doesn’t come with premium features like adjustable ice sizes or integrated freezing capabilities, its speed, compactness, and user-friendly operation make it a highly recommended option for small households or portable needs. You won’t feel like you’re overpaying for what it offers, which makes it an excellent bang-for-the-buck option.

1nx74au,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1nx74au/airbnb_unhappiness/,AirBnB unhappiness,"We recently stayed in an Airbnb during a trip to Italy. The place was fine except that the coffee machine didn’t work. We sent a message to the owner letting him know and he was responsive, which was nice, offering to walk us through it by text or to come over and take a look. It was the evening and we were leaving in the morning, so we weren’t particularly concerned about not having coffee the following morning at the apartment as we could just get some at the train station. We didn’t think it was necessary to make him or anyone come over as it was after regular business hours, so we said we could just do it online.  We sent him pictures of the machine so he would know which machine it was. We followed his directions but were unable to get it to work. 
Now, he has accused us of breaking the machine and filed a charge against us through AirBnB of $250+ . He then accused us of other damages when we said that we had absolutely not broken the coffee machine. 
Please note that we pride ourselves on being good guests and leaving every place we stay in the same condition as it looks when we arrive. We have an excellent rating on Airbnb as well as VRBO. The last thing we would do is damage anything!  So, any thoughts on what we should do?",3,1759516098.0,ItalyTravel,10,0.55,False

We had a german roach infestation in our rented 2 story townhome that we noticed downstairs in January of this year. We quickly took the advice in this sub and sprayed with what we could get our hands on (Advion WDG, Tekko Pro for good measure). Saw two roaches upstairs but the main activity was downstairs in the kitchen area behind the fridge and oven. Kept up with glue traps and spraying downstairs every month, did 2 heavy sprays upstairs total, no known upstairs activity since then. 

Fingers crossed we haven’t seen a german roach since February or March if I recall correctly. I have been seeing oriental roaches in the last couple of months outside our front door and our back patio, and usually find one per week in our glue traps inside. Almost always adults, saw 2 juveniles total. 

We bought a home and will be moving soon. How thorough do I need to be with our move? We are getting new couches, fridge, washer dryer, oven, dishwasher, and microwave regardless. Husband wants to keep toaster oven, stand mixer, and coffee maker. Do oriental roaches move with things like these, or bookcases and a dining set? How can I be sure to prevent this from happening again? I will be fully treating the whole house with the advion/tekko spray before bringing a single item inside. Should I quarantine any items in the garage and spray around it? A storage unit/ box truck isn’t really financially feasible for us. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you. ",1,1759515960.0,GermanRoaches,1,1.0,False

The wifey and I like to camp at renaissance festivals and decided to upgrade our cooking game so we're not eating every meal inside the faire at faire prices. I want to be able to make some coffee with a percolator before grilling/griddling eggs, bacon, toast, etc for breakfast. Units like the Camp Chef Explorer style seem overkill when I just want to make coffee and I don't like the idea of dedicated so much van space to the grill and it's accessories so I'm looking more into styles like the Everest 2x. I looked at some Coleman 2-burner and 3-burner units in store locally and they don't seem to be made as well as the Coleman units of old, that and I want something with more BTU's to get a griddle ripping hot for smash burgers, steaks, bacon, etc. We also often have friends who camp with us, so I want the extra cooking surface a griddle provides when feeding 4+ people.

I already plan on getting an adapter hose to use 5lb and 20lb propane tanks with a 2-burner to have plenty of fuel available. When it comes to griddles on 2-burner units like the Everest 2x, Camp Chef makes their own steel griddle and I've seen people on the sub that go with Lodge-style cast iron griddles. Will a steel griddle have fairly even temps across the surface when on top of 2 round burners? I expect a thicker cast iron griddle to even out the heat pretty well, I just don't want two good, hot zones on the sides and the middle of the griddle be dead space.

tl;dr:

The Everest 2x seems to be well loved on the sub, are there other options I should be looking at as well?

What are y'all's go-to griddle options for portable 2-burner stoves?

Also, we're planning on using the stove on a lifetime resin table. I was going to get a welding blanket to put underneath it. Is that a good path to protect the table or should I be looking at something else?

Getting just a very subtle acidity relative to the notes which suggest a very bright and citrusy coffee. Definitely getting the mellow chocolate note, and a bit of spice on the finish and maybe very slight (but barely noticeable) astringency. Overall smooth and pleasant but not getting the brightness/fruit that is suggested.

4 weeks off roast. 1:16 ratio. Brewing at 205F, grind on the finer side of medium. Doing a simple 60s bloom and 2 gentle spiral pours in the V60. TBT around 3:00 for 13g. Third wave water at half strength.

Anyone have real world experience with this one? My priors for an anaerobic process are to go much cooler and coarser but I know everyone always says you gotta push S&W really hard.

They're exceptionally mid but really the only choice for a small business coffee shop in that area however, I've eaten my last overcooked, overpriced waffle from them.

They just fired their manager who was there everyday during the week because he didn't agree with how they run the business. Dude was definitely there for at least two years since I started at Penn. He was super cool, always nice and funny. Will definitely be missed by us regulars! I was told they gave him no notice and fired him by email. Totally fucked up in my opinion, but I know I only have one side of the story.

Today, I was talking to a friend of mine about this and she said a year or so ago, she overheard one of the guys (short chubby guy with black hair, black beard and a consistently bad attitude) say that he ""wishes Hinge had a race filter"" so he could filter out women of color..... On their Insta, he claims to be the owner.

This prompted me to look into them more and turns out the owners of Top Hat are super religious, working at a non denominational Christian mega church. The owner of the church posted this:

""Indescribable. I’m so sorry, Charlie Kirk. Lord have so much grace on the Kirk family. Please pray for \[Turning Point USA\] and all those a part of that community.

1nx6wj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nx6wj6/we_wore_their_faces_without_knowing_it/,We Wore Their Faces Without Knowing It,"My husband and I moved into the farmhouse just three short weeks after our marriage. It was an old building. White with chipped paint, creaky floors, everything was “original” on the inside. But the charm of the place was where it was located. Out in the country. Quiet, rustic and elegant in its own way. 

Everything was perfect in the beginning. Waking up to the sounds of birds chirping, coffee on the front porch, watching the deer run through the fields, and at night the fireflies would twinkle and glimmer in a magical and surreal way. 

I told my husband over and over again that we were living in the middle of a romance novel. He would just laugh and roll his eyes a little bit. 

“Quit watching Hallmark channel babe. It’s a nice place. But it’s just our home.”

That was my husband. No nonsense. Straightforward and steady in everything that he did. He was consistent, he was a constant, and he was my rock. 

Life was simple for a while. No expectations or worries. But it all slowly started to change. Weird things happened without explanation. 

The first time was about 3 months in. 

I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, when I heard a ticking sound from behind the mirror of our medicine cabinet. It was fast and almost animal like. I opened it up thinking maybe it was a rodent or something like that. But everything was normal. Pill bottles were where they should be. Nothing out of place. 

It happened a couple of times that week, and when I told my husband he just laughed it off. 

“Honey. I swear to God. You watch too many movies. There isn’t anything in this place. Maybe some creaky floorboards. But that’s about it.” 

It was true. I watch a lot of movies. Horror movies especially. But something didn’t feel right about it. It wasn’t natural and it didn’t have a pattern. It was like something in the house was mocking me. Playing with my head. 

It was a couple of nights later I woke up to go to the bathroom. Probably around 2 or 3am. I passed the hallway window and I noticed something. It was my husband. He was out in the middle of the field under the moonlight. Just standing silently and facing away from the house. Wasn’t on his phone, no flashlight. Just his silhouette standing out in the open. 

I was confused at first. Maybe he was sleepwalking? But then he tilted his head up towards the sky and I swear to Christ his mouth opened up like he was going to scream. But no sound. Just that awkward position. His jaw gaping open, and his head held upwards. 

I ran downstairs to try and go out to him. But when I opened the door he was gone. I went back to bed, and he was there. Lying down and breathing normal. Just sleeping. 

But me - I didn’t sleep at all for the rest of the night. When I asked him about it, he had no memory of it. Like it never happened. 

I tried not to let it bother me. That is, what I had seen. But it did bother me. There was something odd about it. Something I couldn’t quite wrap my head around. What the hell was he doing? How did he get back to bed so fast? It didn’t make sense. 

Maybe my own thoughts were deceiving me. It HAD been late at night. I had a nightcap before I went to bed. Took some meds. Perhaps I was in some sort of unconscious state. But I knew that wasn’t it. I had seen it. It was eating at me. 

The other thing was my husband. On top of not remembering what had happened, there was something off about him. Things that most people would probably dismiss as minor, but just didn’t seem right to me. 

He had always hummed when he cooked. Always the same song too - “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey. It was dumb - but it was also charming to me in a silly way. I don’t even think he liked Journey. But since that night, he had just stopped. 

He still cooked for me, still washed the dishes and would lean in for a kiss when I passed by. But it didn’t feel natural. It was almost rehearsed. Off by a few seconds. Unnatural in some way. Like he was pretending to be his own self. 

I tried to tell myself that it was the stress of things changing. New marriage, new house, new lifestyle. Things were getting to my head and that made my mind wander. 

But it got weirder. 

Every night I was waking up to the same scene. My husband standing by the bedroom window. His breath fogging up the glass. Just looking out towards the field. Like there was something there. Something waiting to come out. 

I would call him back to bed. Whisper his name. But he wouldn’t move. He just stood there. Eventually he would come back to bed and roll over into the blankets. Laying there silently. 

He had always snored too. But now he didn’t. In fact, I don’t know if he was sleeping at all. Once I woke up in the middle of the night and I could see his eyes opened wide. Staring at me and my body, studying me. Instead of saying something I would just turn over and try to sleep again. But I couldn’t. I didn’t feel like I was sleeping with my husband anymore. I was terrified. But what could I do? Call the cops? They’d think I was nuts. Call my parents? They wouldn’t believe me. 

Then one day I got an answer. I encountered part of the puzzle. 

I had been outside working in the garden when I saw the glint of metal flash from a distance. It was quick and I almost missed it, but something had reflected the sun on to my eyes. 

I walked towards the general area and just about stepped on it. 

Laying there in the grass was a watch. The leather band was torn, and the metal was bent to one side. I didn’t think much of it at first. My husband always wore a watch. Maybe he had dropped it while he was working. 

But when I picked it up my chest tightened. 

It wasn’t just any watch. It was his watch. The exact watch that I had given him as a wedding gift. His initials were engraved on the side. J.R. I could see them still scratched into the metal. 

I slipped it inside my pocket and headed towards the house. 

My husband was there. In the kitchen. Cooking dinner. He was actually humming this time. But it wasn’t “Don’t Stop Believing”. It was just some low buzzing tuneless sound. It didn’t sound much like anything. 

He stopped as soon as he saw me. 

“Hey babe. How’s the garden?”

I looked over and stared right at his wrist. 

The watch was there. Sitting perfectly snug against his wrist. The leather wasn’t torn. There were no scratches or dents. I could see the initials on the side. J.R. 

I froze in that moment. I fumbled for words and stuttered , “You st- still have your watch…don-don’t you?” 

He glanced down, almost as if he had forgotten it was there. “Of course I do, honey. Why?” 

I did my best to force a smile, and I could feel my hands trembling against my sides. I excused myself to the bathroom and locked the door behind me as I pulled the broken watch from my pocket and set it on the counter next to the sink. 

Two of them. The exact same watch, identical right down to the engraving. 

I nervously wrapped the broken watch inside of a towel and hid it in the cabinet under the sink. 

I tried to sleep that night but I couldn’t. I kept thinking about what I had seen. My husband’s broken watch, and a copy that was in pristine condition on his wrist. 

Something was wrong and I couldn’t put my finger on it. Things felt off. Things weren’t right. 

A couple of days went by and things were still strange. I didn’t feel connected to my husband. He felt foreign to me. 

Then the smell started. 

Faint at first, earthen and metallic, sort of like an old penny. I walked around the house and finally caught the scent most strongly by the hallway closet. We had only used that closet for storage since we bought the home. The smell seemed obvious to me, but my husband hadn’t said anything about it. He had been keeping about his daily routine. Walking throughout the house, tending to things here and there. 

That same night, after I heard his breathing become shallow and low while in bed, I got up and followed the smell. It led me right back to the closet. I opened the door and pushed aside some old coats and objects in the way and finally felt a small gap in the back wall. 

I pushed and a crawlspace opened up as the drywall collapsed. 

I was hit with a wave of rotten air. 

Gagging, I reached for my phone and turned on the flashlight. 

There, inside, curled up into a fetal position, was my husband. His eyes opened but cloudy, mouth frozen open in what looked like a scream. His nails were dirty and I could see traces of dried blood over his body. 

I tried to scream but I couldn’t. My throat had locked up and I could barely manage to breathe, let alone make a sound. I stood up, and stumbled backward into the doorframe. 

That’s when I heard the voice behind me. 

“Ahh. I see you’ve found him.”

I spun.

There he was. My husband, standing in the hall, alive and smiling. Only I knew it wasn’t him. The smile was stretched unnaturally wide, the skin tugged tightly at the corners of his mouth. His eyes were black and wide. 

He stepped forward with a crooked and unnatural gait. 

“It’s okay. Don’t cry. I can explain what’s happened.” His voice was strangely layered and reverberated through the hall.  It was my husband’s voice on top of something else. A deep guttural, animal-like sound. 

“Your husband was imperfect. A rough draft. Just a sketch. I am the finished product.” 

I was inching closer towards the wall as he spoke. My heart was beating out of my chest as I felt cold sweat dripping down my neck.

I looked right at him. “What the fuck are you?” 

He titled his head slightly and pursed his lips together. A wry grin etched onto his face. 

“We are the shadows that follow the ones who walk in the light. We live in the cracks and crevices that you cannot see. We wait until the time is right.” 

My mind was a web of terror and fear. I couldn’t comprehend what was happening. I only knew that I was dealing with something far stranger than I was used to. 

“I don’t understa-“

Suddenly his voice hissed and cracked liked thunder. 

“Do think that your life means something? That it belongs to you? It was never yours. It was ours. You are a placeholder. Every breath you take is a lie. Your dreams, your thoughts, your tender moments…they are borrowed.”

The air around him was cold, and his presence brought a weight and dread that I had never felt. 

His eyes were locked tightly on mine. I could sense a wet and palpable hunger in them. 

“Do you understand now?”, he whispered as he titled his head towards his shoulder and licked his lips. “You are only the marrow that exists so we can have the bones.” 

I heard the sound of steps coming down the hall. A second voice joined in. 

Not just any voice. My voice. 

“Hello.”

A second me stepped out of the bedroom. Same clothes, same hair, she even had the same tiny scar on the corner of her lip like I did. She looked right at me, her eyes manic and hungry. 

Then together, they stepped toward me. Not quickly, but steady and determined. 

I bolted towards the stairs. 

I nearly fell down as I reached the doorway at the bottom, and ripped open the front door. The grass was slicing my bare feet as I ran, but I didn’t dare stop. I didn’t look back until I was more than halfway across the hayfield. 

When I finally looked, I realized that they weren’t chasing me. 

They were standing on the porch, side by side. My husband and my double, their mouths curved upward with bliss. Their hands rose together in perfect unison. 

And they waved. 

They stepped back into the house and I saw the glow of the kitchen light turn on. Through the window I could see her, my double, setting the table with two plates. The thing that looked like my husband, taking his seat at the head of the table. 

They were there in our house, living our life. And in that moment I realized something. They weren’t wearing our faces. We had been wearing theirs. ",5,1759515607.0,nosleep,1,0.86,False

I’ve recently got a grinder and now ordering beans for that. I discovered this curious life - Gundikhan as widely recommended for light roast and aeropress purposes.

While reading the reviews, people have highly talked about Gundikhan Natural Lot 272 but here it is mentioned Lot 15 & 57, what’s the difference here?

Secondly, it is written Filter beside the lot, what does that mean?

1nx6swn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nx6swn/explore_best_espresso_machine_gevi_and_is_it/,Explore Best Espresso Machine Gevi and Is It Worth the Hype,"Testing out the Gevi GECME418E-U+GECGI406B-U7 espresso machine has been quite the journey for me. I'm someone who’s deeply passionate about coffee, and I enjoy crafting the perfect cup in my own kitchen. This comprehensive home barista setup has given my mornings a significant upgrade, but it’s certainly not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

The overall aesthetic of the espresso machine is sleek and modern. The ivory beige color blends effortlessly with a variety of kitchen styles, giving it a sophisticated, yet low-key presence on the countertop. Its compact dimensions, measuring 12.28 by 10.31 by 12.4 inches, fit nicely on my somewhat crowded coffee corner. The stainless-steel accents add a professional vibe while ensuring durability. However, the machine does have a bit of heft to it, weighing a little over 17 pounds, making it less ideal for moving around frequently. Stability, however, is not an issue — this thing is solid.

**Performance and Espresso Quality**

This espresso machine is equipped with a 20-bar professional Italian pump, which is its crown jewel. The pressure system does wonders for espresso extraction, producing creamy, rich shots almost every time. It’s hard not to appreciate the fragrant aroma and depth of flavor the machine delivers. The pre-infusion feature ensures a consistent extraction, which I’ve particularly enjoyed while crafting my weekend cappuccinos. Adjusting the shot volume gives me the flexibility to pull single or double shots depending on my mood or caffeine needs.

**Steam Wand Performance**

Milk frothing is another area where this espresso machine excels. The steam wand quickly turns milk into a silky, smooth microfoam that’s perfect for lattes or cappuccinos. As someone who loves experimenting with latte art, I have been impressed with how easy it is to achieve that velvety consistency. The wand’s detachable design makes cleaning straightforward, which is a huge plus because let’s face it—milk residue can be a nightmare.

**Ease of Use**

While the machine does offer a range of customization options, it does have a bit of a learning curve. The included burr grinder features 35 precise grind settings, catering to coffee enthusiasts like me who enjoy tailoring their brew. However, understanding which grind setting pairs best with the desired shot took a little trial and error. The touchscreen interface is intuitive, though I encountered some lag when navigating through options. 

Another convenience is the removable water tank and drip tray. If you’re someone like me who likes to use oversized mugs every now and then, the adjustable drip tray is an incredibly thoughtful touch.

**Advantages**

- Produces rich, aromatic espresso with its 20-bar pressure system
- Versatile 35 grind settings for coffee customization  
- Stylish design with a premium feel  
- Excellent milk frother for professional-grade microfoam 

**Negatives**

- Heavy and not very portable for those with limited counter space
- Slight learning curve, especially for beginners  
- Interface can be somewhat slow at responding  

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this espresso machine to others in the market, I’ve had some experience with Breville and De'Longhi models in a similar price range. Breville machines often boast faster heating time and more premium materials. However, the inclusion of a burr grinder in the Gevi set gives it a competitive edge, as it eliminates the need to buy an external grinder. De’Longhi models, while reliable, often offer fewer grind settings, which is a letdown if you like to experiment. If you’re after a complete coffee setup without breaking the bank, this Gevi model holds its own remarkably well despite some limitations.

**Cost Efficiency**

Given the robust features, including the burr grinder and advanced steam system, this espresso machine feels like a smart investment. The build quality and performance align well with its price point, and the versatility you get with grind settings and drink customization makes it suitable for both novices and intermediate baristas. While it’s not the cheapest available, the added functionalities provide significant value.
