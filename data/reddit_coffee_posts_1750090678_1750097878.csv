It’s not what it looks like. I smile and....","**Chapter 1**  
 Walking into the lobby of the hotel, the warm air hits me in the face. It’s October and I can already tell that winter is going to be rough. The lady behind the counter looks up from her computer with a look of shock on her face. I can’t blame her. I look like I feel which is crap. Oh, honey are you okay?” she asks. I hate that question. I'm fine. ” I try to smile. “I need a room. Something that’s dog friendly, if you have it.  Of course,” she says, looking back down at her computer and typing. “How many nights? Just one.  I lean on the counter, feeling the exhaustion of the last few days catching up to me.  
Room 312 is dog friendly. You just take the elevator to the third floor and take a right. It will be seventy for the night and a fifty dollar deposit for the dog.  I hand over my card. Waiting for her to finish checking us in, I look down at my new companion. I can’t believe that he saved my life.  
 From what I can remember, I was attacked and he came out of nowhere, jumping on the guy attacking me. The cops said that if it wasn’t for him, I probably would have been killed or in a coma. Instead, I just had a concussion, two broken ribs and a sprained wrist.  Beast was the first thing I saw when I woke up in that alley with the smell of garbage and urine all around me. I thought I was dead until I heard whining and felt a warm, wet tongue move across my face. I opened my eyes to see a huge face looking down on me like some kind of doggie angel. He stayed at my side while I gathered my strength to get up. He never, even when I stumbled into the apartment to call the police. He was my own personal guardian through every moment. Here you go, honey,” she says, handing me the room card. “The elevator is right down that hall. ” She points to the left. Thanks,” I mumble, ready to get into bed. I know that it’s none of my business,” she says and I stop to look at her. “I hope that you were able to get in a few licks before you left his ass. It’s not what it looks like. ” I smile and shake my head. Mmm humm, honey. If you say so.   I don’t have it in me to argue with her so I just let it go and smile. “Come on, boy. ” I drag Beast along with me towards the elevator while trying to carry my bag. “You can smell everything in the morning when I'm not so tired,” I say through a yawn while pulling him behind me.  When we finally reach our room, I'm overwhelmed by the smell of dog urine. I wondered why they take fifty dollars if they were obviously not using it to get the smell out of the carpet. I’m too tired at this point to care and just happy to have a bed. We could sleep in my car but with all of my stuff stuffed in it, there’s not a lot of room. I take Beast’s leash off and go to the bathroom, carrying my bag with me.  
  
  After brushing my teeth and washing my face, I look in the mirror and cringe. I look like a cow. My face is black and blue, my green eyes are red and puffy, my upper lip is cut, and I have so many bruises that even my hair hurts. I pull off my jeans, sweater and bra but keep on my tank top and panties then crawl into bed. Leaning over, I turn off the light. Two seconds later, I feel the bed bounce with Beast’s huge body as he curls into me. And then I'm out.  
  
  The sun is shining through the crack in the curtain. I moan and roll over. Beast is lying on his back with his legs straight up in the air, and he’s snoring. He is the strangest dog I’ve ever met. Not that I have a lot of experience with dogs. I’ve always tried to avoid them. When I was four, we went to visit one of my mom’s friends out in the Hamptons. They had a dog that attacked me. I ended up in the hospital with stitches from my eyebrow to the corner of my eye. Ever since then, I’ve had a deep fear of dogs. Including the small ones that everyone thinks are so cute because they look like you could put them in your pocket. My dog, Beast, is not small. I Googled dog photos after I found him and from what I can tell, he’s a Great Dane. He comes up to my waist when he is standing on all fours. I'm five four and when he stands on his back paws, his head is a good four inches above mine. Surprisingly, I'm not afraid of him at all. Actually, I don’t think I would have made it through the last couple days without him.  
  
  “Come on, buddy,” I say as I pat his stomach. He rolls his body to the side, looking at me like I'm crazy. “Yeah, it’s time to wake up and get back on the road if we want to make it to Dad’s by tonight,” I say while getting out of bed. He still doesn’t move.  
  
  “Whatever. I'm going to shower,” I tell him like he cares. Stumbling my way into the bathroom, I start the shower. As steam fills up the small room, I take off my tank top and panties and climb in. Peeling the paper off the cheap hotel soap, I wash my body. After I’ve washed from head to toe, trying to be careful around the cuts on my legs and arms, I find the shampoo but realize there’s no conditioner. I regret not digging through the stuff in the car last night to find all my bathroom supplies. Getting out and drying off, I try to finger comb my hair enough that I won’t look totally crazy when we make our way down to check out. Not that it will matter, I laugh to myself.  
  
  One look at my face and no one will care what my hair looks like. I find a clean bra and panties and sweats. I throw on a hoodie and put my hair up in a messy knot at the top of my head then slide my sunglasses up to rest on my head till we get downstairs. Walking out of the bathroom, Beast is sitting on the bed, looking like he has been waiting for me forever. Typical male.  
  
  “Come on, boy. Let’s roll. ” I pat my leg and he jumps down from the bed to walk over to me. Sitting at my feet, he waits for me to attach his leash. “Okay, sweet boy, I’ll feed you outside,” I say while double-checking the bathroom to make sure I didn’t leave anything. Walking to the elevator, with beast in tow, I slow down so he can smell everything that he missed last night.  
  
  The elevator opens up and the person stepping out almost stumbles at the sight of Beast. I mean, he is big but he is not that scary looking. His fur is dark gray with black spots, his nose is pink with black spots and his eyes are almost blue. He’s actually really beautiful. I give the guy a look and apologize. “Maybe my face is what scared him,” I say to Beast when the elevator door closes. He tilts his head in agreement. Once on the first floor with the elevator door open, there’s enough light to put on my sunglasses so I slide them down my face.  
  
  Walking to the checkout, I notice there is a new desk clerk. I’m praying we don’t have to have another uncomfortable conversation. That’s when I spot a key card drop box and make my way to it without a second look at the front desk.  
  
  Once I drop my key inside, the smell of coffee hits me. My feet move without my command to the source of my weakness. I love coffee. I drink so much coffee every day that my coffee consumption alone could support a small country. Coffee in hand and a bagel hanging out of my mouth, we make our way out to my car. Outside, the cold air hits my lungs and it feels amazing. I walk to my other baby, my light blue convertible VW bug. I pop the trunk and drop my bag inside then dig out Beast's food and water bowl and set them down on the ground. Leaning against my car, I watch Beast scarf down his food while I enjoy mine. Once he’s done, I put his bowls back in the car and take him to the grassy area near the parking lot to take care of his business. I lay down in the cold grass, looking up into the sky and all I can think is in a just few hours, my life is going to be so different.  
  
  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
  Driving is not fun. Okay, let’s be clear, driving in “my” car with a giant beast of a dog, going from New York to Tennessee is not fun. My car is small and with all my stuff packed in the trunk and the back seat, there is no room for Beast. I feel bad for him being stuck up here with no place to lie down. But I have to say, he is pretty inv  
entive. At one point, his butt was on the seat while the upper part of his body was lying on the floor board. It didn’t look comfortable to me, but apparently he didn’t mind because within a few minutes of finding that position, he was snoring. Who knew dogs could snore so loud?  
  
  We’ve been stopping every couple hours to use the rest room and stretch our legs. We still haven’t made it out of Virginia. To be honest, I’m just glad the roads are clear. You never know what kind of weather you’re going to run into during this time of year. October is one of those tricky months. Some days are beautiful and sunny with fall in the air and other days are freezing and all you want to do is go hibernate for the winter.  
  
  I hate the cold. Maybe after I get settled with my dad, I’ll take a trip to a beach somewhere. The only good thing about winter is being able to wear cute sweaters and boots. But I do miss my dresses during the winter. I wear a dress every day during the summer. I’ve taken sewing classes just so I could make my own summer dresses. There’s nothing like getting up in the morning, taking a shower and slipping on a dress and a cute pair of sandals. There’s no work involved. You can add a cute jacket or extra jewelry but you don’t have to. A dress is simple. During the winter, not only do you have to wear pants and boots but you have to make sure that your shoes go with your top and jacket. Yep, I hate the cold.  
  
  My phone blasting Breathe by Anna Nalick startles me out of my daydream about summer and dresses. Looking at the screen, I see it’s Dad calling.  
  
  “Hi, Daddy. ”  
  
  “Hi, baby girl. Just checking to see how far you got. ”  
  
  Looking at my GPS, I say, “We're still in Virginia and have about six hours left. I’ve been stopping a lot for Beast. ”  
  
  ""Oh, yeah. Forgot you’re bringing that thing you call a dog with you. ” He chuckles under his breath. “I hope you know the only reason I'm letting you bring him into my house is because he saved your life. ”  
  
  I sent him a picture of Beast when I told him he was coming with me. Dad was shocked. He told me that girls were supposed to have little cute dogs for pets, not things that looked like they would eat you.  
  
  “I know, Dad, but he’s a really good dog. ” As if he knows we're talking about him, Beast lifts his head and barks. “I know, sweet boy,” I coo at him.  
  
  ""Yeah, I guess it's not such a bad thing that he can help me scare off all the guys who start sniffing around. ""  
  
  “Ha ha, Dad!”  
  
  ""Well, baby girl, I’ll call you in a few hours to check on you. ""  
  
  “Okay, Dad. Talk to you then. ”  
  
  Hanging up with my dad, I have a smile on my face. I wonder how different my life would be if my mom would have left me with him rather than take me with her. I also wonder why she took me to begin with. My mom met my dad at a graduation party when she was eighteen. They had one night of drunken, unprotected sex and I was born nine months later. Two weeks after that, my mom took off with me to live with her cousin in New York. Growing up, my mom wasn’t involved at all. I had a nanny from as far back as I can remember. Her name was Mrs. B. She lived in the apartment next to us. She was the person I always counted on. If something happened, I would go to her. She would bandage me up or tell me that I shouldn’t cry over boys because they were all stupid. She was the only parental figure I’ve ever really known and when she passed away, I felt like my world crumbled around me. My dad found me not long after Mrs. B’s passing.

  
At first, I was angry and refused to reply to any of the letters he sent. Then one day, I received a huge box stuffed full of cards from birthdays, Christmas, Halloween and every holiday in between. Some looked old and some looked new but they all said the same thing. “Dreaming of when we will spend this day together. ” Since then, we talk every day and he has become one of my best friend’s.  
  
  “Okay, boy, were gonna go take a break. What do you say?” Yes, talking to my dog is now becoming a habit. Most likely, a bad one. I need to make sure that no one is around when I do it or Im going to end up looking like one of the crazy people who think their animal is sending them messages from the other side. That would not be a good thing. I have enough problems without adding insanity into the mix.  
  
  I pull off at the next rest stop and park close to the area designated for dogs. I let Beast out and he shakes his coat and stretches his legs in front of him. We walk over to the grass and I hear another vehicle pull in. I turn around to see if the person getting out has a dog as well. I don’t want to break up a dog fight, and I have no idea how Beast will react to other dogs. I notice that the car that pulled in is still running and no one is getting out.  
  
  The car is a silver Ford Edge with New York plates. The windows are tinted so dark that you can’t see anything inside. Something buzzes across my skin. Beast must feel it too because he starts to growl. Trying to act casually, we start walking back towards my car. I see the back passenger-side door on the Edge open. That’s when I run with Beast running right along beside me. I get my door open and he jumps across my seat.  
  
  Im just able to get the door closed when I see a guy walking in my direction. He’s wearing a black hoodie and black jeans. The hoodie is up so I can’t make out any details of his face, but I know he’s white because his hands are resting on his hips. Without a second look, I put my car in reverse and press the gas pedal. Boxes go sliding as I turn my car to get out of the rest area. I slam the car into drive and start speeding away. I don’t see the Ford Edge in my rearview mirror. My heart is going a million miles a minute and I keep checking for any signs of the Edge. Fortunately, it’s nowhere in sight.  
  
  I start thinking about the whole situation and realize that my imagination is going a little crazy after being attacked. I mean, really, what are the chances that someone from New York would follow me just to try and hurt me again. A few hours later, there’s no sign of the Edge when I check my GPS. I have less than two hours until we get to my dad’s. Looking down at my gas gauge, I see that I have to stop soon to fill up. With that thought, my once calm heart starts to speed up again.  
  
  It’s after seven at night and the interstate is quiet with just a few cars traveling but there are lots of semis on the road. The next exit offers every kind of fast food available so Im hoping there will be a lot of people there. No, not just people. Im hoping for the scary trucker type of people. I exit the interstate and pull into the most well lit gas station around. There are a few other cars getting gas so I get out and go inside to pay. There is a Dunkin’ Donuts and, like a parched man in a desert, I find myself standing in front of their counter. After getting my coffee, paying for gas, and getting another bottle of water for Beast, I step out into the parking lot. Looking around, I walk quickly to my car.  
  
  “That’s a beautiful dog you have there. ”  
  
  Screaming and stepping back, I almost fall over the hose that is going from the pump into my car. “Sorry I scared you, honey. I just saw your dog and he’s a beaute. ”  
  
  “Oh, thanks,” I say while holding my chest. Getting a look at the guy, he looks harmless. He’s dressed a lot like Santa Claus, including the suspenders with a red and black plaid shirt tucked into his jeans and black boots. I can’t help the smile that comes to my face. He smiles back.  
  
  “Russ,” he says, sticking out his hand.  
  
  “November,” I say, shaking his back.  
  
  “What kind of dog is he?”  
  
  “Great Dane, I think. Im not sure. I only looked up pictures online after I found him. His name is Beast. ”  
  
  “You found him and named him Beast,” he laughs.  
  
  “Well, actually, it’s a long story but I guess he kind of found me. ”  
  
  “That I believe!” he says with a sad look on his face. “You take care of him and he’ll take care of you, honey. I used to have a dog like that and he traveled everywhere with me. Even took my back a couple times when I got into a jam. They really are man’s best friend. ” He looks so lost talking about his dog that I wanted to say something but didn’t know what. I reach my hand out and squeeze his. He squeezes mine back then I drop mine to my side and gave him a small smile.  
  
  “Welp, gotta hit the road. Have a load to drop off in Nashville. You drive safe. ”  
  
  “You too,” I say as he walks to a semi with the word yellow written on the back and climbs inside. Then, without thinking, I lift my fist up in the air and pull down. With that, he blows his horn and is on his way. I can’t help the smile that hits my face.  
  
  My GPS announces that we have reached our destination as Im driving up a long private road. In the distance, I see large blue house with a white wraparound porch. Sitting in the dark in a rocking chair is my dad. I slow down to take him in. He has his bare feet stretched out in front of him with a cup in his left hand. He’s wearing jeans with a V-neck blue long sleeve T-shirt. His dark hair barely touches the collar of his shirt and is pushed back from his face. His skin looks tan, like he spends a lot of time out in the sun, but around his eyes is lighter. He probably wears sunglasses when he’s out enjoying the sun.  
  
  I pull up as he stands and starts down the stairs. I try to open my door but he’s already there, pulling my door open. Getting out of the car, my hands start to shake and all of the stress and worry from the last few days comes to the surface. I know that now that Im here, my dad will take care of everything. He is my biggest supporter and the person I can always count on to have my back. He pulls me into a giant hug, shaking me around. When he finally sets me in front of him, he looks down at me and his hands go to my face.  
  
  “You look more beautiful than the last time I saw you, baby girl. Even with all the bruises,” he says, holding my face gently in his hands. His face changes and his jaw gets tight. “If I ever see the fucking guy who did this to you, he’s going to wish he was never born. I hope they catch that fucking coward,” he says, letting go of my face and hugging me into his chest while kissing the top of my head. “Welcome home, baby girl. ”  
  
  That was all I needed to hear for my whole body to relax into his. Welcome home. I actually had a home and it felt beautiful. “It feels good to be home,” I say with a smile. Just then, Beast pushes his way between us. Dad bends down to show him some love. He scratches his head and, in return, Beast licks his face. “Hey, now. None of that,” he says while standing. “So, baby girl, are you ready to see your new place and get a lay of the land or do you want to just see your room and pass out?”  
  
  Laughing, I say, “I’ll just see the room and pass out. It was a long drive. ”  
  
  “I know that you wanted to get here quickly but you should have stayed another night in a hotel. ”  
  
  I didn’t tell my dad about the rest stop because I didn’t want him to worry. And I think I was just being paranoid. But after that happened, all I wanted was to get to my dad’s house and put as many miles as I could between me and New York.  
  
  “I know, Dad, but I just wanted to get here. ”  
  
  “Im glad you made it here safely. Let’s get you inside so you can get settled and get some sleep. "" He puts his arm around my shoulder, taking me with him.  
  
  Walking into the house, I was a surprised that everything looked like it was out of a magazine. By the front door was a long, black table with a bowl filled with keys and coins. The wood floors were so dark, they almost looked black. Walking down the hallway, we enter a room with the tallest ceilings I’ve ever seen. The beams going acro  
ss the room were the same color as the wood floors. There was a wall of windows from one side of the room to the other. The kitchen was open to the living room with an island in the center that was as big as a dining table with five stools in front of it. The appliances in the kitchen all looked new and unused. The countertops are a light granite with brown and red streaming through them. In living room, theres a leather couch that looks more like a bed with a low back. The entertainment center is built into the wall and two leather recliners sit on either side of the low couch. The throw pillows and blankets on the back of the couch match the granite in the kitchen. All the colors in the room blend perfectly together. I see caramel, dark brown, and red everywhere I turn.  
  
  “Wow, Dad, this is beautiful. ”  
  
  “Thanks, baby. Your grandmother decorated it. ""  
  
  “Grandmother?” I ask.  
  
  ""Yeah. She cant wait to meet you. I know we havent talked about my family much but they all know about you and are excited to get to know you. ""  
  
  “Awesome,” I whisper, still in shock that my mom took me when I a baby. She never talked about my dad at all. I never even knew who he was until I turned eighteen and he tracked me down. Every time he has come to New York to visit, he never talked about his family and I never asked. I figured his story was the same as my mom’s. Her parents died before I could meet them and she didnt have any brothers or sisters. My mom has always been a loner, unless you have something she wants. Then, she will attach herself to you like a life-sucking parasite.  
  
  ""Everyone will be here for breakfast. They wanted to come tonight but I thought you might get overwhelmed on your first night home. Also, we need to talk about you doing the books for the club. Your degree will help me get the office straightened out. I don’t have a lot of time to manage that part of the business. Lynn moved away with her husband and I haven’t had a chance to replace her. ”  
  
  “When do I start?” I say, smiling.  
  
  “Well, tonight I want you to rest. ” He squeezes my shoulder. “And for the rest of the week, I want you to recover. After you’re feeling up to it, I’ll take you down to the club and show you the office. Hopefully, you can set something up so you can work from home. ”  
  
  “Sounds good to me. ” Walking through the kitchen, there’s a set of stairs going down to the basement. “Wow, Dad, I thought you loved me and now you’re taking me to the dungeon. ”  
  
  Laughing, he shakes his head. “No. There’s a basement apartment. Your grandma and everyone else came over and worked on it all day yesterday. They rushed over as soon as they found out you’d be staying with me. It also has its own entrance so you can have some privacy. ” He flips on the light.  
  
  “Its perfect. ” There’s a small living room and kitchen when you first walk in. He leads me down a short hall and opens a door. The bedroom is huge and there’s also an attached bathroom with a stand-up shower and a pedestal sink. I’m so overwhelmed that I start crying.  
  
  “It’s okay,” Dad says while dragging me into his body for a hug. “We just want you to be happy here.

1ld0ad1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ld0ad1/broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_with_abandonment/,Broke up with my girlfriend with abandonment issues. Don’t know what to do?,"On Friday night I impulsively broke up with girlfriend with abandonment issues. I was dumb, and it caused her to reflect on the whole relationship and honestly, I was not a good boyfriend. And how I didn’t reciprocate her acts of commitment (she a got a tattoo of my name.) And honestly, I was just mean to her and insecure. But I want her back and I will do better. 

We didn’t talk all Saturday but I blew up her phone with texts and calls which were ignored. (This is something she mentioned that she wanted me to do had we ever get to this point). On Sunday I showed up to her house and talked to her. She didn’t want to initially but then she didn’t want me to leave. She was very upset and said I left her and never loved her and was abusive. She looked at me with complete hate. I begged her enough to where we ended up meeting at a coffee shop. We talked for hours— I cried and said sorry multiple times. I didn’t make any excuses, I just know I ducked up. I can’t change the past but I can own it and change it. 

She then had to go to petco for her cats birthday. I’m very close to her cat so I asked her to come. She was reluctant and said it’s not a good idea but I insisted and she said okay but if I drive. At petco I got her cat a few present and she hugged me, wiped some tears off my pathetic face and held my hand. 

Throughout the day she started opening up and holding my hand. She would make jabs like “I’m just a single girl who wish someone would give her a massage” (I would always give massages). “My cats birthday is tomorrow and you could have been her father”. “I got juice at the house for my boyfriend but he broke up with me.” I knew she wanted me to feel shit like she did so I took it on the chin— but part of me felt like these comments had hope in it. She also made comments like “if we did get back together so much would have to change.” 

After the pet store she said she was hungry, which I knew meant she wanted me to come with her. So we went and got food. At dinner, we laughed had a good time. She made a joke that if we did get back together I would have to get her the biggest ring ever. I made a joke about it and she laughed and said “she hated how much she loved me”. In the drive back she also said she wanted me to know she does love me so much. 

When we got back to her car (we carpooled). She didn’t want me to leave. She said she didn’t want to be alone. She didn’t want me to go. She didn’t feel good. She put her head on my shoulder, we hugged. She asked if we could drink and I said sure I have a bottle and we can take a shot and talk outside her house. She said I wasn’t allowed inside her house. But when it came time to go she didn’t want me to and we went inside. Inside I held her, massaged her, hugged her while she sobbed, and she kept prolonging me saying. (She also changed in front of me but said turn around no naked body for you). These comments give me hope. She did not want me to go home. She kept stalling and asking to do stuff. But she didn’t let me stay the night because she said it wasn’t a good idea. Before I left her house she also made comments like “dont mess with other girls” “your instagram following went up”, and “I don’t think you’re gonna wait for me”.  


When I was leaving she gave me the longest hug ever, I kissed her forehead and she kissed my cheeked. That hug didn’t feel like a goodbye but there wasn’t any clarity when she would reach out. She did make a comment about how she needs the week.

This is my dilemma: 

She had asked for space but with someone with abandonment issues, idk if that’s what she really wants. For example, she didn’t want to talk to me but then ended up spending the whole day with me and didn’t want me to leave. She leaves for Houston on Tuesday and comes back Wednesday night. Today is Monday. I was NOT gonna call or text her all day.

1ld08uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ld08uq/i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_with_abandonment/,I broke up with my girlfriend with abandonment issues. What to do?,"On Friday night I impulsively broke up with girlfriend with abandonment issues. I was dumb, and it caused her to reflect on the whole relationship and honestly, I was not a good boyfriend. And how I didn’t reciprocate her acts of commitment (she a got a tattoo of my name.) And honestly, I was just mean to her and insecure. But I want her back and I will do better. 

We didn’t talk all Saturday but I blew up her phone with texts and calls which were ignored. (This is something she mentioned that she wanted me to do had we ever get to this point). On Sunday I showed up to her house and talked to her. She didn’t want to initially but then she didn’t want me to leave. She was very upset and said I left her and never loved her and was abusive. She looked at me with complete hate. I begged her enough to where we ended up meeting at a coffee shop. We talked for hours— I cried and said sorry multiple times. I didn’t make any excuses, I just know I ducked up. I can’t change the past but I can own it and change it. 

She then had to go to petco for her cats birthday. I’m very close to her cat so I asked her to come. She was reluctant and said it’s not a good idea but I insisted and she said okay but if I drive. At petco I got her cat a few present and she hugged me, wiped some tears off my pathetic face and held my hand. 

Throughout the day she started opening up and holding my hand. She would make jabs like “I’m just a single girl who wish someone would give her a massage” (I would always give massages). “My cats birthday is tomorrow and you could have been her father”. “I got juice at the house for my boyfriend but he broke up with me.” I knew she wanted me to feel shit like she did so I took it on the chin— but part of me felt like these comments had hope in it. She also made comments like “if we did get back together so much would have to change.” 

After the pet store she said she was hungry, which I knew meant she wanted me to come with her. So we went and got food. At dinner, we laughed had a good time. She made a joke that if we did get back together I would have to get her the biggest ring ever. I made a joke about it and she laughed and said “she hated how much she loved me”. In the drive back she also said she wanted me to know she does love me so much. 

When we got back to her car (we carpooled). She didn’t want me to leave. She said she didn’t want to be alone. She didn’t want me to go. She didn’t feel good. She put her head on my shoulder, we hugged. She asked if we could drink and I said sure I have a bottle and we can take a shot and talk outside her house. She said I wasn’t allowed inside her house. But when it came time to go she didn’t want me to and we went inside. Inside I held her, massaged her, hugged her while she sobbed, and she kept prolonging me saying. (She also changed in front of me but said turn around no naked body for you). These comments give me hope. She did not want me to go home. She kept stalling and asking to do stuff. But she didn’t let me stay the night because she said it wasn’t a good idea. Before I left her house she also made comments like “dont mess with other girls” “your instagram following went up”, and “I don’t think you’re gonna wait for me”.  


When I was leaving she gave me the longest hug ever, I kissed her forehead and she kissed my cheeked. That hug didn’t feel like a goodbye but there wasn’t any clarity when she would reach out. She did make a comment about how she needs the week.

This is my dilemma: 

She had asked for space but with someone with abandonment issues, idk if that’s what she really wants. For example, she didn’t want to talk to me but then ended up spending the whole day with me and didn’t want me to leave. She leaves for Houston on Tuesday and comes back Wednesday night. Today is Monday. I was NOT gonna call or text her all day. But I was gonna leave her flowers and a note saying I am respecting her space but since idk when I’ll see her next I hope I hear from her soon or when she comes back from Houston. I’ll be waiting to hear from her. Is this a good idea? Or if not, what should I do? Just give her space? ",1,1750097589.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

i gotta say, i feel as if this is as big a leap forward as internet search…. the speed at which we can get information IRL via things like simple photos rather than limited google searches is pretty dramatic. moreover once we do it from smartglasses with HUDs and our AI is persistently live.

i used it for shopping for vitamins the other days. it already knows my full stack, how much of everything i currently take and how much i aim to take. i took 1 photo of the store shelf and it determined which vitamin product best suited my stack and was of best quality. no cumbersome google search. no complex AI query. just a photo and a voice message “which one?” and in seconds it gave an accurate answer.

i think the ‘live query from images’ while out in IRL is really being under-appreciated right now but once it’s more intuitive for average ppl, we’re going have live AI assistants constantly feeding us information…

anyhow, the ChatGPT response below. 

>>>>

You’re spot-on to question the initial assumption — this does not appear to be a typical HVAC unit. Upon closer inspection of the load on the flatbed (and the one being hoisted), here’s what I can confidently deduce:

Observations:
	•	The load is wrapped in clear plastic and placed on pallets.
	•	Inside the wrapping, you can see multiple large cylindrical objects, possibly white or translucent, vertically oriented, and uniformly shaped.
	•	The cylinders seem too numerous and too narrow to be HVAC compressors, condensers, or air handlers.
	•	There appear to be labels or stickers on the cylinders — common for items like building materials.

Likely Identity of the Load:

Given the shape, packaging, and quantity:
	•	These are most likely rolls of insulation, vapor barrier membrane, or roofing underlayment.
	•	Another possibility is ducting or tubing, like PVC or HDPE pipe rolls used in plumbing, electrical conduit, or rooftop mechanical layouts.

Why it’s probably not HVAC:
	•	HVAC units are generally boxy, metallic, and shipped as discrete large rectangular units — not cylindrical rolls.
	•	HVAC gear is usually crated or exposed, not shrink-wrapped in this fashion, because it needs ventilation and inspection access.
	•	No visible electrical panels, louvers, or fans typical of rooftop ACs.

⸻

Conclusion:

The load being hoisted to the rooftop appears to be wrapped building material, likely insulation rolls, vapor barriers, or ducting tubes, not an HVAC unit.
This aligns with rooftop maintenance or construction prep, possibly for installing a membrane roof, waterproofing, or new piping systems.",1,1750097582.0,ChatGPT,2,1.0,False

1ld05ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq9/comments/1ld05ma/evgo_pricing_at_flying_j_pilot/,EVGo Pricing at Flying J / Pilot,"I am planning a trip from STL to NJ very soon and was checking out the prices for chargers along the way. I was excited to see so many Pilot gas stations having EV chargers now, however was appalled at their pricing. I doubt it will do any good but I wrote up the below Email and sent it to their Guest Services, Media Relations, and Sales team.

  
Dear Pilot / Flying J Team,

I’m reaching out today to share some feedback and a suggestion regarding the pricing of EV charging at your locations. As a recent EV owner based in Saint Louis, MO, I’ve been exploring road trip options and was excited to see that Pilot and Flying J stations are expanding their EV charging network. Your locations have always been my preferred stop during long drives; thanks to your fresh coffee, tasty food options, and consistently clean restrooms.

With that in mind, I was especially hopeful to support your network rather than defaulting to Tesla’s Supercharger system. Like many EV owners, I want to encourage broader competition and support companies like yours entering the EV space.

However, when planning a trip to visit family in New Jersey, I was surprised to find that charging at your stations is significantly more expensive than nearby Tesla Superchargers, even without a Tesla membership. Below are a few examples from my research, based on adding 40kWh to my vehicle:

   * **Pilot #1174 – Marshall, IL:** $0.63/kWh Tesla – Effingham, IL (Jack Flash): $0.51/kWh → *$4.80 savings at Tesla*
   * **Pilot #445 – Marengo, OH:** $0.69/kWh Tesla – Ashland, OH (Wingate) & Columbus, OH (Sheetz): $0.47/kWh → *$8.80 savings at Tesla*
   * **Pilot #697 – Hubbard, OH:** $0.67/kWh Tesla – Girard, OH (Shell): $0.47/kWh → *$8.00 savings at Tesla*
   * **Flying J #709 – Mill Hall, PA:** $0.49/kWh Tesla – Mill Hall, PA: $0.52/kWh (*non-member*), $0.38/kWh (*member*) → *Your rate is great here! But Tesla still wins for members.*

While I truly appreciate the effort and investment you’re making to support EV drivers, the current pricing structure unfortunately makes it difficult to justify choosing your chargers over alternatives. And that’s a shame, because I would *much* prefer to stop at a Pilot or Flying J than at a nondescript hotel or basic gas station. In fact, on a recent trip, my family and I stopped at a Casey’s to charge and ended up buying a breakfast pizza, coffee, and sodas. I know EV customers would bring you additional business since we are there so much longer than a typical gas customer.

I share this feedback not as a complaint but as a sincere suggestion. I, and many other EV drivers, would love to support your charging network, especially if your prices were more competitive. If adjustments could be made, I think you’d see increased usage and additional revenue from in-store purchases as well.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and please feel free to share it with others within your organization. I’d be happy to provide additional feedback if it would be helpful.

Warm regards,

sew3521

Needless to say, I think I will be buying a Tesla membership for the drive out there and back. It will more than pay for itself. And that charge time will not be that much more.",1,1750097395.0,Ioniq9,0,1.0,False

Another, who survived the death of her child after a long illness, saved herself from despair by realizing that God was helping her through strangers.*

**Olga Golovina, editor Ksenia Tatarnikova. Miloserdie.ru**

https://preview.redd.it/1sdpset0ub7f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=62910eae21b900fbecf35d39e6a27447976e0748

In Russian, there is an expression, “naivalitsya vsem mirom” (literally, “to pile on with the whole world”), which means to pull someone out of trouble. But in today's individualistic society, it seems outdated—we are urged from all sides to be independent and self-sufficient. Asking for help has become awkward, even humiliating.



The fires that raged across California in January 2025 destroyed the homes of many city dwellers, including that of 50-year-old journalist Megan Daum in Altadena. All her material possessions were reduced to ashes. She lost her favorite works of art and books, manuscripts and archives accumulated throughout her career, all her family photos, and her clothes. She had nowhere to live.



Having lived many years, she faced such a situation for the first time—she was forced to sleep in other people's homes, wear other people's clothes, feed her surviving dog with other people's food, use her friends' email, accept donations of shampoo and soap, and after some time, even agree to an offer to stay in a friend's small guest house “for as long as necessary.”

# Her father would have been horrified: he taught her to be proud and not to beg

It's scary to imagine what her parents would say if they found out about this. Meghan was born into a family where self-sufficiency was considered the highest virtue.



Her father walked several kilometers to the hospital when he had a heart attack, just so he wouldn't be a burden to anyone. He grew up in a very poor family and was raised by a single mother who rented out rooms in her small apartment so she wouldn't have to ask for help.



Megan's mother considered it a crime to ask a classmate's parent to drive her daughter home from school, even though they lived next door. Many years later, when her mother was dying in her small room, a neighbor offered to let her use his spacious bedroom, which happened to be empty. He offered it with the best of intentions, just like that, without asking for anything in return. Her mother was too weak to resist, but she still demanded that Megan repay him financially or refuse. Help was still unacceptable to her.



# A difficult choice on the ashes

[Megan stands on the ashes of her home. Photo: https:\/\/observer.co.uk\/](https://preview.redd.it/8wf6paipub7f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b775d3542c5f8c7901c36f5d223d7c15bc88c172)



Megan herself was sure that she would never ask anyone for anything. After the fires died down, everyone gathered on the ashes—neighbors, friends, those who had lost their homes, and those who had not been affected. It smelled of smoke and disaster. The National Guard blocked the deserted streets—many houses were reduced to nothing but charred chimneys sticking out of the ground. It was painful to look at, the smoke stung her eyes, they began to water, and there was a feeling of endless tears all around.



When she heard that her friends wanted to start a fundraiser for her on a crowdfunding platform, everything inside her rebelled. After all, she was an adult, independent, able-bodied person, and she had no dependents to take care of except her beloved dog. She refused to accept such help, but she needed money desperately, and Megan found a way out: if you want to help, become a paid subscriber to my podcast. But her friends didn't want to pay her for her work; they just wanted to help.



Life seemed to have presented her with a choice: either learn to accept help or perish in the embrace of her pride. Megan saw this as an assault on her values; it seemed to her that people were offering help because it was the done thing, for form's sake. Perhaps they secretly hoped she would refuse?



# Survivor's guilt

[Fire in the city. Photo: https:\/\/observer.co.uk\/](https://preview.redd.it/jr77rzvwub7f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7ca5a6c3572685fc9175e7c2d17f3fdcef42a81)



Megan was struck by the fact that those who were not directly affected seemed more depressed than those who had lost everything—it seemed as if they blamed themselves for being “lucky” to have escaped the dangerous situation unharmed. In psychology, this is called “survivor's guilt,” a type of post-traumatic stress disorder in which a person is haunted by intense feelings of guilt because they survived an extreme event—a natural disaster, epidemic, or war—unharmed, while others died.



Those who lost their homes were unable to fully comprehend what was happening; the shock of the horror they had experienced protected them, and the grief of those who experienced “survivor's guilt” seemed deeper. It was as if they had looked into the abyss and seen the scale of the disaster.



Reaching out to help the victims was a kind of salvation for these people, their only consolation, and they literally begged, “Please let us help. It's as important to us as it is to you.” What Megan was feeling cannot be put into words. Where had her self-sufficiency and pride gone? At that moment, she felt a sense of shared loss, a genuine human connection, a willingness to come to her aid and accept her. Kindness that suddenly became as necessary as air.



She realized that helping others plays by the same rules as love: to give it, you must be willing to receive it. When you accept help, pride gives way to gratitude, and everything changes. How she wished her parents, her unyielding grandmother, would understand this truth and stop tormenting themselves with false shame that they were not rich enough, not successful enough. Their lives could have turned out differently. Life is indeed unfair at times, but that doesn't mean we have to let it get the better of us.



# Never complained to anyone

[Sarah with her family on her daughter Orly's 13th birthday. Photo: houstonpublicmedia.org](https://preview.redd.it/dect6cb9vb7f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=aab25326767d641ff0e4638afcb22ddccdb9e4d5)



Sarah Wildman, journalist and mother of two beautiful daughters, had a similar experience, although her loss was incomparably more tragic: her teenage daughter's terminal cancer and subsequent death forced the woman to rethink her attitude toward help and gratitude.



Like Megan, Sarah never complained to anyone or asked anyone for anything. Her eldest daughter Orly was diagnosed with liver cancer at the age of 10. “How could this happen? I breastfed her,” - Sarah repeated senselessly. Endless IVs, fear, pain, hope, liver transplant surgery, metastases, weekly trips to the hospital. Sarah did not think (and did not realize) how close she was to her breaking point. Living on pure adrenaline had worn her out to the limit; she hardly slept, lost her sense of reality, forgot what it meant to take care of herself or ask for support. Her husband and friends offered help, but she waved them away: “I can do it myself!”



But when her mother suddenly fell ill and her elderly friends spontaneously organized a shift to take care of her in the hospital, Sarah felt a huge sense of relief — she was literally overwhelmed with gratitude. The persistent desire of strangers and friends to help did the trick, and at some point the dam broke — she suddenly realized that she had really wanted to be taken care of for a long time. She was just afraid to admit it even to herself, didn't want to want it. Being vulnerable when your child is suffering so much is dangerous, as if you might break down.



# ""It was as if someone had come up and hugged me""

When Sarah, her husband, and daughters arrived at their friends' beach house to spend a long-awaited vacation between Orly's surgeries and found peaches, coffee, milk, and eggs, as well as a note expressing their friends' joy at being able to help, she burst into tears. It was like a hug.



Sarah felt as if she had awakened, remembered. The salesman offered to deliver the plant she had bought at no extra charge. An actress she barely knew donated her time to teach her daughter acting skills via video. A childhood friend patiently stood in the ocean for hours trying to teach her daughters how to surf. These displays of care and kindness from friends and strangers seemed to open up a new way for her to see and understand the world.



Most of us cannot live cut off from each other — the limits of human self-sufficiency have been demonstrated quite recently by the pandemic. A person is not okay if they are alone in trouble; individualism and pride do not bring the strength and satisfaction they promise. We need other people to support us. In Sarah's circumstances, this became painfully obvious. After another operation, when Orly got a break, the whole family went to the ocean. Once on the beach, Orly rushed into the water, swam, and lay down on a deck chair. “How beautiful,” she said, looking into the distance, then turned to Sarah and asked, “What if this remains the best thing that ever happened in my life?”



# Don't be afraid of those who are going through a disaster

[Sarah with her daughter Orly. Photo: houstonpublicmedia.org](https://preview.redd.it/t2jx7zmovb7f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=268e0d6a079e2d6cf9c0431a96885d92f62e0270)



Three hundred and seventy-six days later, she died. She was 14 years old. It was cruel and terrifying. Orly's illness and death forced Sarah to rethink what God meant to her. Waking up in the morning and praying or asking for something specific no longer worked. Especially since her younger daughter, who loved her older sister dearly, kept asking, “Did this happen because God doesn't love us?” It was difficult for Sarah to answer that question. “I believe that He sends us His love through people, and we must see the divine in those who tried their best to help us and were not afraid of us.” It is very easy to fear a family experiencing a disaster.



The fundamentals of capitalism state that you get what you pay for, that people are fundamentally selfish individualists and seek to derive maximum benefit for themselves from any situation. But society would fall apart if it weren't for those who come to the rescue, whose generosity exceeds all expectations, who recognize that people can be in need, vulnerable, and weak, who care for others without any benefit to themselves, and who are able to accept help without being humiliated by it.

I'm walking at a very casual pace, eating and enjoying the sunshine. He's walking much slower than me but is about five feet behind and I can literally see his shadow beside me. 

Tbh I wasn't really thinking about it at all but if you asked me I would have to say I expected he would come to pace with me in a moment as he was walking at the pace of a literal toddler. Like, I am five feet tall and he is over six feet and I am putting zero effort into walking quickly. Then he starts in with a ""why the hell are you walking so far ahead that's super rude"", to which I replied, ""if anything I think you're walking extremely slow, I'm walking at a super normal pace and I have really short legs"" I wasn't expecting this to be an argument but he goes ""what the hell is your problem, that's rude af and if you ask anyone they would agree with me"" and it literally spun out from there where I was like I really don't understand the issue, and he said I'm just being a bitch and have been a bitch and I said well now I really actually don't want to walk with you and he even said some shitty things about us potentially splitting up when our lease is up. 

Like I am just trying to enjoy a coffee and didn't even consider that I HAVE to match HIS pace for some reason, why not the other way around? Why is it up to me to be at his level when he's walking so slow the pace is actually uncomfortable for me to even match? Like I have to put exaggerated effort to walk as slow as he wanted to and again, why is it on ME?

Like genuinely afraid that Iran might launch ballistic missiles or even nuke my city. But at the same time, I held onto this weird sense of hope—like maybe, *just maybe*, the regime in Iran could fall. Especially after hearing that Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, was rushed to Russia—kind of like how Assad did the same thing in Syria about 6 months back.

And here's the crazy part: that hope started showing up in my dreams. Like, full-blown vivid dreams. Not just one, but a whole series of recurring dreams. And they’re honestly some of the most fun and hopeful dreams I’ve ever had. Here’s how they went down:





# 💤 Dream - June 13, 2025

I’m at Ben Gurion Airport, picking up my passport. Israel and the *new* Iran had just formed an alliance—like pre-1979 revolution vibes. Iran had been overthrown, and things were changing fast.

I grabbed McDonald’s with my family (Chicken Nuggets, McFries, and a bottled Coke Zero—yeah, I remember the details lol). Then we boarded a flight filled with Israelis and tourists from Europe, Japan, South Korea, the US, Thailand—you name it. After a 2-hour-and-23-minute flight, we landed in Tehran.

Except… it wasn’t Imam Khomeini International Airport anymore. It had been renamed *Mohammad Reza Shah Airport* after the overthrow. First stop: the newly reopened McDonald’s (apparently it opened 3 days earlier in the dream). Then we hit up this epic hotel—think water slides, free internet, just pure fun.





# 💤 Dream - June 14, 2025

Woke up in my hotel bed feeling super happy. My whole family woke up too—mom, little bro, little sis, older sister. We had breakfast: Belgian waffles, boiled eggs, and coffee for me.

Then it was back to the water slides—especially one with this crazy loop that made it the best ride ever. Afterward, I visited *Iran Science Park* in Tehran. It was super fun and actually really educational. We wrapped up the day with dinner and sleep. Just an all-around awesome and wholesome day.





# 💤 Dream - June 15, 2025

Same vibe as the day before—woke up feeling good, had the same breakfast (can’t go wrong with waffles and eggs), and hit the slides again.

Then we visited *Eram Zoo Park* in Tehran. Saw so many animals, including a lion. It was honestly such a blast. Another chill dinner and bedtime. Just like June 14th, but with a new twist.





# Overall Thoughts

These dreams were something else. Full of hope, peace, fun, and joy. A world where Iran was free, open, and welcoming. Where people from everywhere could visit. I don’t know if it’ll ever come true—but man, I really hope it does.

Seriously, those dreams felt real. And maybe one day… they will be. 🌍🕊️

**Fic Summary:** Aziraphale was irate when his brother Gabriel gave him a top-of-the-line spin bike for his birthday, but he might have changed his tune once he turned it on and saw a handsome red-headed instructor.

**Chapter Excerpt:** The light breeze ruffled Aziraphale’s curls as he walked down the path where he had arranged to meet Crowley. Right away, his eyes caught on the other man standing behind a short fence and gazing out at the duck pond. He was wearing form-fitting black jeans, not quite as tight as the ones he wore at the club, with a lightweight black jumper. Just like at the coffee shop, he had on a black cap and dark sunglasses.

Crowley’s back was to him, and Aziraphale took a moment to appreciate his slim figure. Aziraphale had known for a long time that he was attracted to men in the abstract, but no one had ever gotten his attention like Crowley. He could chalk it up to the intimate moment they shared at the club, but he’d never before looked at someone’s body and had his palms itch to reach out and touch.

As he waited, Crowley’s head darted from right to left, but he hadn’t spotted Aziraphale yet. Aziraphale continued down the path, and as he approached, he watched Crowley’s shoulders relax and his face soften when he finally saw him.

meanwhile, the banner for free shipping on all EU orders over 60 euros is still up, which is false advertising. who would want to pay 16 euros for shipping for 2 coffees and a matcha???

1lcztld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lkk_life/comments/1lcztld/grief/,Grief,"From some old guy


Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. 

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself.

No explanation. No comment on food, coffee, service. Just that one word.
Filthy.

And I haven’t stopped thinking about it.
Why? Because I remember that exact day.

It was one of those beautifully chaotic days — line out the door, espresso flying, happy customers, kids everywhere. We were on FIRE. Rockstar energy. Full house. Café magic.

Then it happened.

An older woman quietly let us know something had gone horribly wrong in the restroom.
And friends… it wasn’t just a mess.

It was a full-scale biohazard event.
A gastrointestinal apocalypse.
A floor-to-ceiling disaster courtesy of…
💩 The Mad Sh*tter 💩

Sink. Walls. Handicap bar. Paper towel dispenser. Nothing was spared.
I had to close the bathroom immediately. There was no going in and out of that and returning to serve brunch like nothing happened.

So I waited until the café was empty, created a makeshift hazmat suit out of trash bags and broken dreams, and spent the entire night cleaning.

I left in the morning, exhausted but proud. Everything was sanitized, spotless, and safe.

Then I got home… opened my phone…
And saw the review.

“One star. Filthy.”

😵‍💫

Was it the Mad Sh*tter himself?
Was it someone who saw the chaos and said nothing, only to post it online later?
We’ll never know. But what I do know is that we worked our hearts out that day — and every day — to create a space that’s clean, cool, and kind.

So here’s your reminder:
Small business owners do it ALL.
We clean. We serve. We survive chaos with grace (and bleach).
And still smile when we hand you your latte.

To our community: we love you.
To the keyboard bandits: thanks for the material. 💁‍♀️

In this post, I’m going to break down **everything you need to know about Dripshipper** — how it works, who it's for, pros, cons, alternatives, and tips to succeed.

  
Dripshipper is a **private label coffee dropshipping platform** that allows anyone to launch a branded coffee business online without having to:

* Roast their own coffee
* Store inventory
* Ship orders
* Deal with fulfillment

Instead, Dripshipper handles the backend. You focus on **branding, marketing, and sales.**

When someone places an order on your website (usually Shopify), Dripshipper automatically fulfills it: printing your logo on the packaging, roasting the beans fresh, and shipping it to your customer.

# How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ **Create Your Store:**  
You build your store using Shopify and install the Dripshipper app.

2️⃣ **Design Your Brand:**  
Upload your logo, choose your coffee bag designs, create your product listings, set your pricing.

3️⃣ **Add Coffee Products:**  
You can select from a variety of roasts, origins, grind types, and blends that Dripshipper offers.

4️⃣ **Market Your Store:**  
Drive traffic via ads, SEO, social media, influencers, etc.

5️⃣ **Order Processing:**  
When a customer places an order, Dripshipper handles roasting, packaging, and shipping automatically.

# What Makes Dripshipper Different?

* **Fresh roasted to order:** Coffee is roasted after the customer orders it.
* **Private label:** Fully branded packaging with your logo.
* **Fast fulfillment:** Most orders are roasted and shipped within 3-5 business days.
* **Low upfront cost:** You don’t need to buy bulk inventory.
* **Integration:** Seamless Shopify integration.

# Who is Dripshipper best for?

✅ Entrepreneurs starting their first ecommerce business  
✅ Coffee enthusiasts who want to build a personal coffee brand  
✅ Influencers or content creators adding a product to their audience  
✅ Existing stores adding coffee as a product category

# Pricing

Dripshipper charges a **monthly subscription** for access to the platform and fulfillment network. You also pay the wholesale cost for each coffee product sold.

💡 *Pro Tip:* Keep an eye on your product margins. Typically, you’ll see:

* Wholesale coffee cost: \~$8–$12 per bag
* Retail price: $18–$25 per bag
* Profit margin: \~$8–$12 per order (before Shopify fees, ads, etc.)",2,1750096442.0,dropshipUSA,1,1.0,False
1lczp7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/1lczp7q/misconception_about_edwin_in_sotmhe_did_not_just/,"Misconception about Edwin in SOTM(He did not just build stuff others designed, part 2)","I already made a post about this but since this is continuing to be spread around I feel like I should clarify further. Namely, as I didn't include some stuff that is stated in the game.

Its been spread around that the new game reveals Henry and William 'did nothing' and that Edwin did all the work. In response, many fans have been spreading that 'All the designs came from Henry and William, Edwin's job was just to build stuff!'.

I feel like this is basically fighting a misconception with a misconception.

Yes, Edwin was a contractor. But the extent of his job was not just 'He is given designs and he builds them'. Fiona was the one who designed the classics, Edwin said that he and her got the art approved for them. Henry and William did want to alter the designs late in production but Edwin refused.

""Are they insane? The look of these new animatronics is Fiona's design and they're great. First they approve the art. Then they approve the proofs. Now, they change their minds when we're so close to the final. Why would they change them now? Are they pulling my leg? The new concepts are frankly creepy. It doesn't matter... I'm not changing a single bit of her work and they can't make me.""

And in the Secret Ending they heavily imply the core 4 originated from a bedtime story Edwin and Fiona used to tell David.

I brought all of this up in my last post on the subject. But I feel like I should go on with some info I didn't mention last time. In addition to the above, it is stated in the audio that Edwin was the one who came up with his own creations.

(Transcripts here)  
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1glhM3XwLEWbaBjWOudCepz3PwrZsBnlvg6cVXW4X610/edit?tab=t.yig4tusimfos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1glhM3XwLEWbaBjWOudCepz3PwrZsBnlvg6cVXW4X610/edit?tab=t.yig4tusimfos)

""Fiona: ""Ed, you're not going to want to hear this, but there's a lot of grumbling on the work floor.""

Fiona: ""You have a lot of new ideas and new projects coming in, but the staff can't keep up with all your changes.""

Fiona: ""Your creative energy's amazing and I love you for it... but I think you need to step back a little and focus on one project at a time.""

Fiona makes it very clear Edwin is the one making his own stuff. His creative energy caused him to constantly change designs and that's why the staff could not keep up.

I should also point out something about Edwin that a lot of people haven't talked on, he wasn't just a dude William and Henry talked with, he was their friend. Up until their greed ruined that.

""What the hell was that? They treat me like some contractor to crack a whip at. Fiona was right. They don't think of me as a friend anymore. This is the last project I ever do for them.""

That's Edwin's character, he was the 'third guy' in the Henry William Edwin friend trio. The missing puzzle piece that we never knew of until now. He wasn't a third founder but he's close to that, insofar as he is the third 'man behind everything'.

None of this means William and Henry did nothing, mind. Henry still made the classics we know they just would have been based on Edwin's prototypes. And the funtimes to our knowledge were entiirely William's work. But Edwin was definetly made into a major part of the early lore and where a lot of stuff from classic Freddy's originated.

Also it is implied they were straight up stealing stuff from Edwin. Like Edwin has to fire 2 employees for taking his ideas and Edwin mentions someone leaked M2s existence to them. So its implied William and Henry were having employees conspire against Edwin.

Attention traitors, admin wing permissions have been revoked.""

""Edwin: ""And no, you can't clear out your desks! You stole my work.""

Edwin: ""Now your jackets, purses, and coffee mugs, and anything else belongs to me.""

Edwin: ""Maybe I'll go find someone to sell your stuff to. How does that feel?""

Another tape.

""Edwin: ""Project update. I figured it out. There's a leak.""

Edwin: ""Someone told them about M2. Well, they can't have it.""

Edwin: ""Every copy has failed. I don't even know why it worked the first time, but it did. It's just not ready.""

TLDR:People are laser focusing on 'Edwin was a contractor' to say he just built stuff Henry and William came up with but the full game makes it clear it wasn't simple as that. Edwin was a huge part of the classic lore now, that doesn't mean its bad. Just pointing out the truth.>!&#x200B;!<",1,1750096407.0,fivenightsatfreddys,0,1.0,False

Through the pines he saw backlit Manhattan become The Bronx, then yield to suburbs. Deer flinched in the dappled underbrush as he passed. The sun rose faster and swung over his right shoulder to warm his back.

A journalist friend had introduced him to cycling, pulling him out on long rides up this road, and he had grown to love the burn in his legs and lungs as he fought up the hills. The route was the same but the ride changed with the seasons and as his radius extended, from the ranger station, out to the cafe called The Market, to Nyack and eventually Bear Mountain, 50 miles north. 

His journalist friend called the outer reach of his cycling range his ‘blast radius’ and joked about a statistician in a book he’d read who wouldn’t live within the blast radius of a nuclear bomb exploding in New York City, saying the probability and likely scale of a major terrorist attack was always growing. Ten million New Yorkers and then some seemed to disagree with that. ‘How’s that for statistics?’ he’d said. 

Sweat glistened in his beard as he popped out onto 9W, turned right and continued north, stopping at The Market for an early coffee and brownie. Today was a Bear Mountain day and he was half way to the foot of the climb.

Once you got to the bottom of Bear Mountain, four miles of tarmac spiraled gently to the top and he put his head down for the final push. He imagined what his family would think of the sight of him all in Lycra, panting up this hill, his dark brown limbs shining with sweat, his sunglasses a months wages in the town he grew up in. He had left them a world away, coming to New York on his own to make a name for himself, to do the big thing. He was on a mission.

A mile left and the signage for the tower at the top began. He knew where he’d sit, a rock shelf facing south but away from nervy tourists. All around was forest, tinder dry for early summer. From the rock, Manhattan was a notion on the horizon, a tiny bar chart of skyscrapers, a squint. All the noise, ten million and more Americans and all the cars and trains and concrete and steel of the city behind a horizon of forest. 

A dozen people milled around the mountaintop quietly in the mid-morning. He sat and peeled the wrapper off a protein bar. Turning, he snapped a selfie with Manhattan in the background and dropped it in his family WhatsApp group, and then shared it with his journalist friend with the caption ‘blast radius extended 😂’. He was pretty sure he was away for the weekend but couldn’t be sure.

He looked back at Manhattan and then closed his eyes, offering up a prayer of gratitude. Reaching for his phone, he dialled a 917 number. 

50 miles south, a cellphone rang inside a Newark shipping container.

He kept his eyes closed but could feel the flash of light through his eyelids. The sounds of panic surrounded him but quickly moved away from him. He opened his eyes and saw the mushroom cloud rising down the Hudson, the gray bar chart of Manhattan skyscrapers gleaming then disappearing. 

He was safely outside the blast radius. ",1,1750096379.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

Leave a comment ""yes"" and I’ll send it.","My wedding to Ethan Reed was just weeks away. After seven years, I was certain of our perfect future.  
Then, Ethan claimed ""selective amnesia"" from a head injury, forgetting only me. I tried to make him remember, until I overheard his video call. ""Total genius move,"" he boasted to friends. His amnesia was a fake ""hall pass"" to pursue influencer Chloe Vance before our wedding. Heartbroken, I feigned belief. I endured his open fl\*\*ting with Chloe and their taunting selfies. He mocked my distress, prioritizing Chloe's fake emergency. After an accident he caused, he abandoned me, injured, choosing to send Chloe to the hospital first. He even tried to cut me off financially.  
How could my fiancé be this cruel, calculating monster? His betrayal poisoned every memory.  
I felt like a fool for trusting such boundless cruelty. His audacity left me reeling. But I wouldn't be his victim. Instead of breaking, a cold plan formed. I would shed my identity, become Olivia Carter.  
I would disappear, leaving him, my past, and his engagement ring behind forever, claiming my freedom.  
**Chapter 1**  
Ava Miller picked up the tiny, pearl-studded tiara. It was supposed to be her ""something new.""  
Her wedding to Ethan Reed was only three weeks away. Seven years. They had been together for seven long, happy years. Or so she had thought. Now, Ethan didn't remember her.

Not her face, not her name, not a single day of those seven years.

The doctors called it selective amnesia. A minor knock on the head during that stupid ""charity Tough Mudder"" he'd insisted they do. He remembered his parents, his business, even his d\*\*n dog, Buster.

Just not Ava.

""I'm so sorry,"" he'd said, his eyes, usually warm and full of love for her, now held only polite confusion. ""You seem like a nice person, but I... I just don't know you.""

Ava put the tiara down. Her hands were shaking.

She had to make him remember. Their whole life was in boxes, labeled ""Ethan & Ava's Future.""

She spent days turning their apartment into a museum of their love.

Photo albums stacked on the coffee table. His favorite, their trip to Montauk, opened to the page where he'd pretended to propose with a seashell.

She played their song, a soft indie track from a concert they'd stumbled upon in their first year.

He just smiled politely. ""Catchy tune.""

Her best friend, Maya Rodriguez, a paralegal with a b\*llshit detector sharper than any lawyer's, wasn't buying it.

""Ava, honey, this is... convenient,"" Maya had said, stirring her iced coffee, her eyes narrowed. ""Loses memory of just his fiancée weeks before the wedding? What is this, a soap opera?""

""It was a head injury, Maya.""

""A 'minor' head injury,"" Maya corrected. ""Look, I just want you to be careful.""

Ava waved it off. She had to believe. She was researching neurologists, joining online forums for partners of amnesia patients. She was going to fix this. She had to.

She was in Ethan's home office, searching for an old concert ticket stub. Dr. Matthews said familiar objects could be triggers.

The office was messy, Ethan's usual organized chaos.

His laptop was open, a video call still active but minimized. She heard voices.

Ethan's voice. Laughing.

""... total genius move, I'm telling you. Best idea I've ever had.""

Ava froze.

Another voice, one of his old frat brothers, Mark, cackled. ""So, this amnesia thing is legit working? She buys it?""

""Hook, line, and sinker,"" Ethan boasted. Ava could hear the smirk in his voice. ""Another month of freedom, boys. Chloe Vance, that influencer I was telling you about? She's definitely on board for a good time. A little hall pass before I settle down.""

Her breath caught. Chloe Vance? The one with millions of followers and barely-there outfits?

""And then what?"" another friend, Dave, asked. ""You just magically get your memory back?""

""Exactly!"" Ethan's laugh was loud, carefree. ""Right before the wedding. She'll be so relieved, so grateful I ‘remember' her. Forgive and forget any little... confusion during my ‘illness.' Ava always forgives me. She's a keeper that way.""

The concert ticket stub slipped from Ava's fingers. It fluttered to the floor.

The world tilted.

Her father's smiling face, then his strained excuses. Her mother's tears. The slam of a door. The word ‘divorce' hanging in the air like poison.

This was that, all over again. The same sickening betrayal.

Trust didn't just crack; it vaporized.

She backed out of the office, silent. Her heart hammered a painful rhythm against her ribs.

He thought she'd forgive him. He was counting on it.

She walked into their bedroom, the room they were supposed to share as husband and wife.

She looked at the wedding dress hanging on the back of the door, pristine and white.

A lie. It was all a lie.

She wouldn't marry him. She couldn't.

But she couldn't let him know she knew. Not yet.

A tiny, cold seed of a plan began to sprout in the wasteland of her heart.

She would play along. For now.

Chapter 2  
The next morning, Ava acted like nothing happened.

She made Ethan his favorite pancakes, the ones with blueberries.

""These are good,"" he said, still the polite stranger. ""Did I... like these before?""

""Loved them,"" Ava said, her voice carefully neutral.

Inside, she was a storm.

Later that day, she called a lawyer Maya knew. Discretely.

""I want to inquire about a legal name change,"" Ava said, her voice low.

Olivia Carter. Her maternal grandmother's maiden name. A strong name. A new name.

She opened a new bank account under Ava Miller, but it was a temporary holding place. Soon, it would all be Olivia's.

She started taking small freelance graphic design gigs, cash-only or paid to a new, untraceable account. Tiny jobs, logos for bakeries, flyers for yoga studios. She worked late into the night, after Ethan was asleep, the click of her mouse a quiet rebellion.

Portland, Oregon.

The name came to her as she scrolled through articles about cities for creatives, for fresh starts. Far from New York. Far from Ethan. Green, rainy, anonymous.

It sounded like a place someone could disappear.

It sounded like a place Olivia Carter could be born.

She gathered every photo of them together.

Every love note he'd ever written, full of promises that now felt like ash in her mouth.

The silly stuffed bear he'd won for her at Coney Island.

She didn't burn them. That felt too dramatic, too much of a reaction he might notice if he ever truly looked.

Instead, she packed them into a single, plain cardboard box.

She shoved the box into the back of her closet, under old sweaters she never wore.

Out of sight. Not yet out of mind, but a start.

She was detaching, piece by piece.

A week later, Ava was at their usual coffee shop, waiting for Maya.

Ethan walked in.

With Chloe Vance.

Chloe was all long legs, blonde hair, and a bright pink dress that screamed ‘look at me.' She was laughing, her hand on Ethan's arm.

Ethan saw Ava. He hesitated for a split second, then gave her a small, awkward wave, as if she were a distant acquaintance.

Chloe's eyes flicked to Ava, a flicker of something – triumph? – in them.

Ava just sipped her latte, her expression carefully blank.

She felt a strange, cold calm.

Ethan looked... surprised. He probably expected tears, a scene.

He didn't know this Ava. This Ava was already gone.

Chloe detached herself from Ethan and sauntered over to Ava's table.

""Ava, right?"" Chloe's voice was syrupy sweet. ""Ethan talks about... well, he doesn't remember much, but he mentioned a friend was helping him.""

Ava kept her face smooth. ""Yes, that's me.""

""It must be so hard for you,"" Chloe cooed, flipping her hair. ""He's such a great guy. I'm just trying to be there for him, you know? Support him through this awful time. He told me you knew him best before... well, before. Any tips?""

The audacity.

Ava looked directly into Chloe's perfectly made-up eyes.

""No tips,"" Ava said, her voice even. ""I'm sure you'll figure it out.""

Chloe's smile faltered for a microsecond.

She clearly expected Ava to be a weeping mess.

""Well,"" Chloe recovered quickly, ""if you think of anything..."" She turned and glided back to Ethan, linking her arm through his again.

Ava watched them leave, Ethan's arm now around Chloe's waist.

The new Ava, the one who was becoming Olivia, felt nothing but a distant, cold resolve.

Chapter 3  
A few days later, Ethan called Ava, his voice laced with fake panic.

""Ava? It's Chloe. We were at my place, and she... she fell. She hit her head on the coffee table. I think it's bad.""

Ava's heart didn't even jump. It was all part of his show.

""Is she conscious?"" Ava asked, her tone professional, like a paramedic.

""Yeah, but she's dizzy. Says her vision is blurry. I need to take her to the ER.""

""Okay,"" Ava said. ""Do that.""

She knew this was a test, another way to reel her in, to make her jealous or concerned.

It wasn't working.

When Ava arrived at the ER – Ethan had insisted she meet him there, ""for support"" – he was making a huge fuss over Chloe.

Chloe was on a gurney, a perfectly placed ice pack on her forehead, looking pale and fragile. Ethan was hovering, stroking her hair.

""She's been my rock through all this,"" Ethan announced loudly to a nurse, making sure Ava could hear. ""Such a dear friend. I don't know what I'd do without her.""

He shot Ava a look, clearly expecting her to react. To be jealous. To fight for him.

Ava just stood there, arms crossed.

A doctor finally saw Chloe. A mild concussion, they said. Keep an eye on her.

Ethan made a big show of relief, hugging Chloe tightly.

""I was supposed to have a neurology follow-up with you today, Ethan,"" Ava reminded him, her voice flat. ""We had an appointment.""

Ethan looked flustered. ""Oh, right. Well, obviously, this is more important. Chloe needs me."" He turned back to Chloe, all tender concern.

Ava just nodded. ""Right.""

Another piece of his ""devotion"" facade crumbled. He was prioritizing his fake girlfriend's fake emergency over his own ""recovery.""

Later that night, Ava's phone buzzed.

A picture message. From an unknown number.

It was Ethan and Chloe. K\*ssing. A selfie, clearly taken by Chloe, her tongue just visible.

The caption: ""He's feeling much better. ""

Ava deleted it without a second thought.

Then another. Chloe in Ethan's shirt, sprawled on his couch, looking smug.

Delete.

Another. A close-up of their hands, intertwined.

Delete.

The messages kept coming, a barrage of staged intimacy.

Chloe, or Ethan through Chloe, was trying to break her.

They didn't realize Ava was already broken, and rebuilding herself into someone they wouldn't recognize.

Ava sat on her bedroom floor, the one box of their shared past still in the closet.

She remembered Ethan, years ago, when she'd had the flu. He'd stayed with her for three days straight, making her soup, reading to her, holding her hand.

Genuine care. Real love.

Or had that been an act too? Part of a long con?

The thought made her stomach clench.

The Ethan who sent those pictures, who flaunted his fake amnesia and his new girl, was a monster.

The tears she'd been holding back finally came. Not for the Ethan she was losing, but for the Ava who had believed in him for so long.

For the fool she had been.

A week later, Maya dragged Ava to a gallery opening. ""You need to get out. See people who aren't Ethan or his new side piece.""

And of course, Ethan and Chloe were there.

They were the center of a laughing group, Chloe practically draped over Ethan, her hand possessively on his ch\*st.

Maya stiffened beside Ava. ""A\*\*holes.""

Ava just watched them, a strange detachment settling over her. They looked like characters in a poorly written play.

Ethan caught her eye. He smirked, then leaned down and k\*ssed Chloe, a long, deliberate k\*ss. For Ava's benefit.

Ava turned away, heading for the bar.

As she reached for a glass of w\*ne, a hand shot out and covered hers.

Ethan's.

""Don't,"" he said, his voice low, almost a growl. ""You're allergic to red w\*ne, remember?""

Ava froze.

For a split second, his eyes were clear. The old Ethan. The one who knew her.

Then, just as quickly, the fog returned. Or he pulled it back into place.  
He blinked, looking confused. ""Sorry. Did I... say something wrong?"" He stepped back, turning towards Chloe, who was now approaching, her eyes narrowed.

""Everything okay, babe?"" Chloe asked, sliding her arm through Ethan's.

""Yeah, fine,"" Ethan said, shaking his head as if to clear it. ""Just... a weird moment.""

He let Chloe lead him away, not looking back at Ava.

A flicker. A mistake. Or another calculated move?

Ava didn't know. And she was starting not to care.

1lcznbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1lcznbj/discover_the_ultimate_palmolive_ultra_dish_soap/,"Discover the ultimate Palmolive Ultra Dish Soap review for spotless, grease-free dishes!","Dishwashing is a daily chore no one can escape, and I’m always on the lookout for products that make it easier and quicker. Enter the **Palmolive 10035000458848 Ultra Dishwashing Liquid Dish Soap, Oxy Power Degreaser**, which has become a staple in my kitchen over the past few weeks. While it checks plenty of boxes in the dishwashing category, it also has a few quirks worth mentioning, especially if you’re considering adding it to your cleaning arsenal.

**Packaging and Design**  
The product arrives in a durable, no-nonsense 32.5 fl oz bottle, and with a pack of four, it feels like a stock-your-pantry situation. The bottle design is ergonomic, and the nozzle dispenses just the right amount of soap with a light squeeze. I’ve had products that either spill too much at once or require Herculean effort to get anything out, so this was a refreshing change. While the design is functional, it’s not the flashiest on the market—more utilitarian than chic. That’s hardly a deal breaker, though, especially when you’re after performance.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
The standout feature here is the Oxy Power Degreaser. This soap does not mess around when it comes to grease and stubborn stains. I tested it on everything from lasagna-baked pans to coffee-stained mugs, and it delivered every time. The grease practically slides off, and for those really stubborn spots, I just let the soap sit on the surface for a minute or two—it worked like a charm. It’s also phosphate-free and Kosher, which is great if you care about eco-friendliness and dietary considerations.

[Check **Palmolive 10035000458848** price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0744grjbz/)

**Ease of Use**  
What struck me immediately after a few uses was how little of the product is required to get an excellent lather. A single squeeze easily washes multiple dishes, which speaks volumes about its concentration. The scent of the Oxy Power Degreaser is mild and not overwhelming, a welcome change for anyone prone to getting headaches from overly fragrant cleaning products. I could tell this was a well-thought-out feature, especially for families with sensitive noses.

**Key Benefits**  
- Exceptional grease-fighting power.  
- Mild, pleasant scent suitable for most users.  
- Highly concentrated, requiring only small amounts per use.  
- Phosphate-free and eco-friendly.

**Weaknesses**  
While the product shines in multiple areas, a few drawbacks came to light after extended usage. First, the liquid is quite slippery, so if even a little gets on the floor, prepare for an accidental slip if you’re not careful. Additionally, the smaller nozzle, while great at controlling output, clogs occasionally. It’s not a huge inconvenience, just worth mentioning.  

- Slippery texture can make cleanups tricky.  
- Nozzle is prone to occasional clogging.  

**Competing Products**  
Having tried a couple of other dish liquids like Dawn Platinum and Method Dish Soap, I did notice some subtle differences. Dawn Platinum boasts grease-fighting power that’s comparable, but it lacks the eco-friendly phosphate-free formula of this Palmolive one. On the flip side, Method Dish Soap wins on aesthetics and sustainability but doesn’t quite match the heavy-duty cleaning prowess offered here. The tradeoffs you’re willing to accept really depend on what you prioritize—efficiency, design, or eco-friendliness.

**Quality for Price**  
This dish soap feels like a blend of premium cleaning performance with an affordable price tag, especially since it comes in a multi-pack. Some might balk at the upfront cost for a pack of four, but when spread out among months of usage (thanks to its concentrated nature), it turns into a savvy purchase for households. Products in this tier often charge extra for phosphate-free formulations, but Palmolive keeps things reasonable. It’s a win in the financial value department.

[https://www.oxo.com/oxo-brew-oth-pour-over.html](https://www.oxo.com/oxo-brew-oth-pour-over.html)

OXO has had their Melitta style dripper (flat bottom cone? or whatever we want to call it) with water reservoir for a while and then they made a collapsible one. It all packs up into itself and has a nice little round carry bag. I used to use an aeropress for travel but I'd say this is somewhat more compact and even more convenient. It's super easy cleanup using the standard size 2 melitta style filters. It also is super easy to pretty much use anything to heat and pour water into the wide reservoir (so even easier than the narrow aeropress tube). 

I have a little old school metal toolbox that is my coffee travel box and I can fit this with a small scale, my Kingrinder K6, and ceramic no handle mug with a silicon sleeve that I use as a kind of kettle when necessary (can heat water in microwave and still hold it with the silicon sleeve). But also, the water reservoir has markings and it's pretty accurate, so you could pre measure and grind coffee and then forego the scale, grinder, kettle, etc. and just have this little thing.

It's not as precise as my v60 and gooseneck kettle at home but it is VERY VERY easy and convenient and produces a totally acceptable cup. It's my new travel/camping buddy.",2,1750095917.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

## Why listen to this?

Because I have doom-scrolled every GLP-1 thread since 2023 and kept a nerdy Google Sheet on what works, what sucks, and why. If you are tired of medical gobbledygook, grab a coffee and read on.

---

## The elevator pitch

1. You jab a once-weekly pen.  
2. Drug copies a gut hormone called GLP-1, sticks around instead of vanishing in two minutes.  
3. Brain hears “buffet finished, we’re full” all day.  
4. Stomach empties at half speed, pancreas releases insulin only when needed.  
5. Hunger turns into a background hum and the scale drifts down.

*That’s it. The rest is fine print.*

---

## How it **feels** according to real users

- Dinner leftovers finally make it to lunch.  
- Grocery bill drops because chips sit untouched.  
- You catch yourself pushing plates away instead of licking them clean.  
- Side quirks: random burps tasting like last night’s tacos, bathroom slowdowns, an occasional wave of quease if you wolf food too fast.

## Three myths that still pop up

1. **“It melts fat all by itself.”**  
   Nope. It turns down appetite so *you* burn stored energy. No calorie gap, no fat burn.

2. **“You can eat anything on it.”**  
   Grease bombs still trigger nausea. Balanced meals = smoother ride.

3. **“Tirzepatide is just stronger sema.”**  
   Different second receptor means responses vary. Some bodies vibe better with sema.

My spouse (32M) and I (33F) are doing IVF because I have a dominant genetic disorder (50% chance of passing it on) that can cause severe skeletal and cardiac problems. In November, we started probe creation with Juno Genetics, opting to do both PGT-M and PGT-A. I did my baseline testing around that time, when I was still 32. Fairly low AMH for my age at 1.13. TSH was 2.91 and antral follicle count was 15.

I also had a full uterine septum, and while my doctor didn't care if I fixed that issue before or after my egg retrieval, we had an insurance change early 2025 that set our IVF plans back a little, so I did the septum resection while waiting for that to get sorted out. The septum was super thick and ended up requiring two surgeries three weeks apart. I was cleared to start IVF shortly after the second surgery. By this time, I had turned 33.

Full flow period started Saturday, May 3. Went in for initial testing Monday, May 5. There was a complex fluid collection near my right ovary. Throughout the cycle, this continued to be pesky as it was blocking the ultrasound view of that ovary. Estradiol was 51.3; progesterone was .6.

May 5 evening, I started my Provera tablets and 300 units of Follistim, both of which I was supposed to also do Tuesday and Wednesday night. I did the Follistim as instructed but forgot to take my Provera Tuesday and Wednesday. I took one first thing Thursday (May 8) morning, before going to my bloodwork appointment at 7:50 a.m. My estradiol was 65.9 and progesterone was .55.

The next two nights (May 8 and May 9), I went down to 225 units of Follistim and added 150 units of Menopur. Saturday, May 10 estradiol was 236.1 and progesterone was .56. I had four follicles measuring between 9.6 and 11.6mm.

Stuck with the same Follistim and Menopur dosages the next two nights, and on Monday, May 12, my estradiol was 693 and progesterone was .64. Eight follicles measuring between 9.5 and 16.0mm.

Continued with the same Follistim and Menopur dosages. Wednesday, May 14 estradiol was 1,127 and progesterone was .87. Fourteen follicles ranging from 9.0 and 17.3mm. Because two of my follicles were bigger than 16.5, my clinic wanted me back in one day rather than two. Wednesday night, I continued with the 150 Menopur/225 Follistim.

On Thursday, May 15, my estradiol was 1,284 and progesterone was 1.17. Fourteen follicles: 18.4, 18.2, 18.0, 16.9, 16.6, 15.6, 14.9, 14.4, 13.9, 13.8, 11.3, 10.6, 9.6, 8.8

Dual trigger on Thursday night: 1 syringe (250 mcg) Ovidrel, 4mg/80 units Lupron.

My retrieval was in the morning on Saturday, May 17. When I woke up and heard they'd only retrieved nine eggs, I was fairly disappointed. The next day, we got the phone call that only six of the nine were mature and only four of the six fertilized (via ICSI, which my clinic requires for PGT-M). I was *very* disappointed about the attrition. Being down to four and knowing that number was likely to be cut in half *twice* considering blast rates and PGT-M for a dominant condition was super disheartening.

Blastocyst call came Friday, May 23. ALL FOUR MADE IT! This was soooo shocking and thrilling. We ended up with two day-five embryos: a 3AA and a 4BA; and two day-six embryos: a 4BA and a 4BC.

A week later, on May 30, we got the email from Juno that they'd received our biopsies. We returned the payment authorization ($400/embryo) over the weekend and got a confirmation Monday morning (June 2) that testing was starting and would take 2-3 weeks.

Exactly two weeks later, we got the call from our clinic's genetic counselor with these results:

* Day-five 3AA: passed PGT-A and PGT-M
* Day-five 4BA: passed PGT-A and PGT-M
* Day-six 4BA: passed PGT-A but failed PGT-M
* Day-six 4BC: failed PGT-A and PGT-M

We're really, really thrilled with these results! There were lots of times in the last month of waiting that I felt sure we'd wind up without any good embryos, so to say I'm relieved is an understatement. We feel very lucky for these results, and hope that when we implant one in 6ish months, we continue to have good luck.

A little more info: I didn't drink any alcohol for about two months prior to the cycle. Before that, I was usually having 2-3 drinks a week. My spouse stopped drinking once I started stims. Just for a couple weeks before the cycle and during it, we focused on getting more vegetables and fish, but I was still eating chocolate and ice cream and about 1/2 cup coffee a day. I doubt any of this had an impact, but it made me feel some degree of control.

My spouse was in charge of all medication prep, dosage management, and giving injections. I never learned how to prepare an injection and didn't want to. I told him at the beginning that my body was doing the work so his brain could. He just told me when to appear at our shot station, gave me the shots, and then handed me my pill and an ice pack so I could retreat to the couch. That's my biggest stress management tip: if you can, assign thinking tasks to someone else!",8,1750095758.0,IVF,3,1.0,False
1lcze1r,https://i.redd.it/0nbetr57tb7f1.jpeg,24 hours later and I think I… I get it!?,"Okay so whoever saw my post last night knows I started a 5d water fast- I honestly did NOT plan on doing a 5d water fast. It was a somewhat spontaneous idea I had around midnight. I am so fed up of all the bs excuses I tell myself. Oh it’s not that bad, oh we can always start tomorrow, next week, blah. Bullshit.

I started my weightloss journey this year. I started losing weight since last November, though. My starting weight was terrifying 108 kg and I lost 13 kg ever since. Because stuff happened I got busy and didn’t really count my calories or fast anymore, for weeeeks. So my weight has remained the same. 95/96 kg. 
I understand I am not overeating, but I am also not doing enough to actually *lose* weight. At this point I want to say, I have fasted before. My longest fast lasted 3 days, yeaaars ago. I’m not new to fasting, basically.

My life has been….anything but easy. Food was my outlet and comfort and god, do I have a lot of problems I have been carrying with me, my whole life. I understand if I want something to change, *I* need to change. And that was my realisation last night. Because if nothing changes… nothing is going to change. And hell, I am writing this as someone who went through multiple different EDs and unfortunately depression. 
I’ve been on this sub for who knows how many years. Every week or so I see someone uploading their results and I tell myself I could do the same, just not now. Not today. My job is too exhausting, there is this birthday coming up, this trip, whatever. Excuses. 
& I think I just…hit the point where I just- no longer want to harm my body anymore? I don’t aim to become very skinny or supermodel like, but I want to feel comfortable in my body at the very least. I want to be able to wear what I want, hell, I want to know what it’s like to wear a shirt that doesn’t have to cover your butt and belly or other areas. 

——————— so I decided I’d do this, no matter what. (Please don’t ignore the signs of your body, though. Be aware of your own limits, take supplements serious & take good care of yourself during your fasts).

And here is the thing, right.
Yes, I fasted before in the past. But I’d feel hungry pretty quickly… Most often I could not even hit the 1-day mark.

Today, was different. Entirely different. And I’ll tell you why.
I did not feel hungry, and I still do not feel any sort of hunger. My belly has not crumbled. I have not had any food ever since yesterday. I had water, water with flavour but no cal and no sugar, coffee and chewing gum. + Meds as I am still recovering from a cold I had last week.
I worked a 8-6 shift on very little sleep. I did feel tired throughout the day but I’ve always had this issue + I barely got any sleep last night. My head hurt a bit here and there but I made sure I drank enough water so it faded.

I feel incredible! Hell, I never feel like this after work. I am just DONE, I work in the social field so my job is mentally and physically exhausting… but today, I feel this rush. I have so much more energy, even right now. I came home, did some dishes etc. and now once I upload this I will have a shower & afterwards I’ll just unwind and rest :)
My point is, what changed everything for me is **KNOWING** this girl isn’t gonna get any food for the next 5 days. I think this was the issue I had in the past… My approach was different. It was more like “oh let’s see how it goes” kinda thing. B* not this time. 

Not. This. F*ing. Time.
and if I can do this, so can absolutely you. I promise you. I know how hard it is. I couldn’t find any motivation for months and months if not years. But just imagine yourself at your goal weight, or whatever goal you’re aiming for.  You have to feel it. You have to visualise it. Imagine all the clothes you could finally wear, all the odd lil things you are avoiding right now because you don’t feel comfortable enough.

You got this. 🫶🏻
Join me in my fast :) I’ll keep updating you guys on my progress.

1lcz9qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/1lcz9qb/motel_workers_stole_my_stuff_when_i_was_evicted/,Motel workers stole my stuff when I was evicted,"I was staying at a motel/caravan park through Link 2 Home as I was homeless recently. I had been staying for nearly 2 months and was working with Community Housing to help secure more permanent accommodation. I was away for one night due to a family emergency and due to a rule being that I needed to be there every night or I would be at risk of breaching my tenancy, I was evicted without being contacted and the motel workers had entered my cabin packed up my belongings. 
They claimed to have attempted to call me several times however I had no missed calls or texts from them, although 3 days prior they had called regarding a seperate matter, which indicates they had the correct contact details for me.
Without my consent or knowledge, they had entered my cabin and packed my belongings. They had unnecessarily moved stuff from one box and put it into another instead of just packing things into that same box. They touched intimate items of mine including a vibrator that was stored in the bedside table. I am missing several items including a dress that was hanging in the closet between other dresses that were packed, several pairs of shorts, a power board, an extension cord
My partner is currently away at the moment and he left his wallet with me by accident. I had this with me at the cabin stored in a box along with several other items that were going to taken to storage for the time being.
I had a small tin box that was locked with a key that was stashed in the back of my partner’s wallet. The box contained drug paraphernalia that was no longer at use such as a marijuana grinder, rolling papers.
I had a small toolbox that had both mine and my partners names on it. 
When I had gotten a call from Community Housing the day I was evicted, she had advised me that the police were notified as I was in possession of items that were questionable. This would insinuate they had gained unauthorised access to the locked box. I made it clear I will be contacting the police as I have had my privacy completed compromised and upon contacting the caravan park the employee who had packed my belongings had actually answered the phone. She was extremely rude and told me I was not getting my stuff back. I informed them I will be pursuing legal action as they have breached laws and legislations stating that a hospitality worker cannot enter or interact with a guests room or belongings without official consent unless there is practical footage taken of the entire process or a witness is present the entire time. This witness also cannot be a family member as that is a conflict of interest regardless of their working statuses.
I had a call back from a manager who had informed me I was able to come and collect my stuff and it was now sitting at the entrance of the office; under the cameras view and out of the rain. 
When I had arrived to collect my belongings, the first thing I had noticed was a boxed package that was sealed had been opened. I knew I had not opened this myself and I was immediately alarmed. I had called for the head manager (who is also the owner) to attend the office to discuss the situation. She was completely in denial anything had been tampered with although she didn’t witness the packing of my stuff. She also admitted there was no video footage and that the employees who packed my belongings were mother and daughter therefore a conflict of interest to one another and footage would have need to be taken. 
I had informed her I was once an assistant manager of guest relations at a four star resort and I know my rights as a guest and the laws in place that all hospitality employees are required to abide by. 
She attempted to ** me by stating they packed my belongings up as they couldn’t reach me on my mobile and were worried about me. She asked me what would I have done in that situation. I said I would have called the police and informed them of my guest not being contactable etc. to which the agreed and apologised for that not being the case in this situation. 
As soon as I picked up one box to put into my car, she hightailed it out of there and didn’t even answer the phone when I called back.
That evening after I had unpacked everything, I discovered I was missing quite a bit of items. I emailed the caravan park office and notified them of my discoveries and requested all my missing items are returned immediately or I will contact the police for further investigation. 
The owner called me (on the number they couldn’t reach me on the day prior) and informed me she did in fact call the police because she was worried for my welfare and she had also given my partners wallet and our toolbox to the police for further inquiries.
I asked her why on earth she would have done that and where my other items are and she said blatantly that she did not know where they were. I was furious and I told her she needs to sort this mess out immediately as I am not only completely homeless now but also out of pocket for food that I had purchased to get me through the week and personal items that cost me a lot of money. I would now need to inform my partner he needs to get a full wallet of ID replaced simply because someone has gone through my stuff without consent: where is the justice… 
I contacted my local police station and was informed someone would call me back as soon as possible. 
An officer called me back within the hour and was actually quite rude, insinuating I deserved to have this happen to me as I was evicted. I then asked who I speak to in order to put a stolen property report in as that’s what it will come down to and he said nothing was stolen as if he was there. I told him there needed to be footage if no applicable witness was there at the time and he had directly said there is footage and he had seen it himself. I asked where this footage was and he told me to follow up with the caravan park. He was just absolutely disgustingly rude to me. 
They had taken and kept all the grocery items I had bought which I will list below, and as someone who is homeless and on a very low income, I am unable to afford to replace those items.
I want all of my belongings back and I want these people to be charged with theft. 
How do I go about this….

The items that I have been able to gather that a missing are:

Locked tin cash box 
Partner’s wallet containing several forms of ID
Toolbox containing several different tools
Power board
Extension cord
Mortein Mozzie Coils
Torch
2x Pumice Feet Stones
Paco Robanne Pure XS 100mL Perfume

Fast forward to this year and it looks like all the negatives were addressed and then some! My partner's wheelchair is really only any good for razzing around the high street and the rough terrain kills her back and the chair's battery, so to see nice flat surfaces everywhere was very satisfying!  
  
My concerns now are minor niggles; on the main accessibility platform, the seats designated for BSL needs were not particularly well labelled as such, a single piece of laminated A4 was present but there was nothing on it to say ""x amount of seats are saved for"" - accidentally sat there and got moved for our troubles but it could have been avoided with better signage.  
 
Also maybe move a few of the shops in there too, while there were a couple by the sensory centre that could be accessed by a wheelchair and not all the way on the other side of the arena by the second stage, most of them sold jewellery. My partner was quite disappointed that with her mobility issues she couldn't really get to the places she wanted to go, but she was happy she could at least go get a coffee on her own as it was flat and level enough to get to one.

I figure if I understand how the type of bean effects the variables, I can start my dialing in process closer to the ballpark.

I.e. my understanding is that darker beans requires a smaller dose because the beans are lighter/less dense, so less coffee fills up the basket. ?

Likewise I hear you are supposed to tweak your settings as the beans age, so wondering if that means I need to grind finer/coarser etc as I reach the end of the bag.

1lcz1ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTellyTalk/comments/1lcz1ch/haale_dil_3_epi_analysis/,Haale Dil - 3 epi analysis,"The trailer reminded me of Anupama so I wasn't super interested in watching it. But I don't have Netflix at this point so I decided to give it a try. My analysis:
The story is around four characters:
Indu/Anupama
Vivek/Vanraj
Kavya/ Dolly
Kavya's Husband/ Kushal. 

I found Indu's character interesting, she is positive, sees the best in everyone and tries to help everyone. She knows Vivek doesn't love her, she knows she isn't good enough for him. Vivek never tells her, he gaslights, manipulates, I feel like she knows he's gaslighting, manipulating she doesn't think he loves her, she's just waiting to win him over. Her love language is acts of service, she'll try to make coffee he likes, she knows which watch he likes and gets it for him. 
No one is mean to her like in Anupama, her in laws speak to her respectfully, even Vivek puts on an act. He gaslights and refuses to spend time with her but is never upfront and rude and Indu isn't mistaking this for love she knows he's not interested she just is hopeful he will be one day.

 So far Vivek is the least developed character he makes it clear he was compelled to marry her, and is cheating with dolly. He doesn't seem to be committed to her there's no label. 

Dollys character surprised me the most, she's a working women but she's not Kavya. She lives with her husbands family. Kushals family loves her and know that Kushal does not deserve her. She does gaslight him and is cheating on him, but she also makes an effort with him. She's makes an effort with his entire family. The family survives on Kushals dad's pension and dollys salary. Shes not like most ITV bahus who expect the family to be her slaves, she has a good relationship with everyone, is sweet to her SIL, sweet to her useless brother in law, her FIL claims that they don't know why she married Kushal but there so lucky cause they wouldn't survive without her. Shes an active member of the family, an ideal working bahu. Shes also makes an effort with her husband (unless she's cheating) and she defends her husband in front of the man she's cheating on him with.

Kushal is like Akshay Kumar from houseful (Punoti/Bad Luck) and SRK from Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. He's a reporter that's always messing up, he can't get a story, he's broke and his ego won't let him take support from his wife. They didn't show his character much before he suspected her cheating but he was very quick to reach that assumption. 
Seeing how sweet Dolly is to him and his family i am surprised how much quick he was to get to the conclusion- he also accused her of always manipulating and gaslighting him and needed proof before calling her out. 

I don't really see why Dolly is with Kushal? Why she's supporting his family financially, when Kushal is so bleh and quick to assume she's cheating. 

Dolly doesn't seem like she has any intention of leaving him and seems to give him emotional support.

In the first three episodes, they've developed these characters, kushal told Indu there spouses are cheating, she ofc doesn't believe it, and it looks like they'll be going on a road trip to prove their points.

I am happy to say this is definitely Anupama but in a diff direction. I think Indu and Kushal may become a couple but I hope they don't, I hope Kushal learns to be self sufficient, Dolly leaves him but not for Vivek, Indu also learns to live for herself...

That’s the NYC mood today. I run my own company and work from home, which is a dream *most* of the time. But right now? I’m in a boredom spiral.

Remember the “office wife” dynamic? The laughs, the gossip, the “Are we actually working or just vibing?” moments? Yeah, me too. And honestly, I’d give anything for one of those random mid-afternoon snack debates or “Guess what happened last weekend” story sessions.

If you’re also staring at your to-do list and thinking, “Eh, maybe later,” say hi! Let's chat, swap stories, and make the day a little brighter. Who says camaraderie is only an office thing?

I’m Tyler I’m a Utah local, lifelong dog dad, and founder of Willow & Co. Off-Leash Social Club, a dream I’m bringing to life right here in Salt Lake City.

What is it? 
It’s not just a dog park. It’s not just a bar. 
It’s a 21+ indoor/outdoor space where: 
• Dogs roam free, safely and happily 
• Humans kick back with coffee by day or a craft drink by night 
• Local artists, musicians, and makers find a home 
• Community thrives one paw at a time

Think “dog park meets microbrewery meets co-working patio vibes.”

Why I’m here: Building something this unique means funding is a beast and I’m tackling it one step at a time. I’ve officially registered the LLC, identified locations, and started working with local development teams. But now I’m asking for the community’s help to take this from blueprint to backyard.

Please find our Instagram @willowandco.SLC

Every dollar goes toward early costs: legal, permitting, design, and building a clean, safe, and enriching space for dogs and their humans.

If you’ve ever wished dog parks were less chaotic, patios were more dog-friendly, and social spaces were built with real community in mind… I hope this idea makes you smile. And if you’re able to share or chip in, thank you from the bottom of my heart (and paws).

Let’s build something a little wild and a whole lot of fun. 🐶🍺 #UnleashAndUnwind",3,1750094917.0,DevelopmentSLC,6,0.71,False

1lcyvhm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcyvhm,Sharing My Fragrance Journey + Top Picks & Where I'm Headed Next (Suggestions Welcome!),"So this all started back when I was a kid — The kind who'd sneak into his dad’s cupboard and go full bloodhound on his perfumes. I had no clue what I was smelling, but I knew I liked it. That innocent fascination slowly faded over the years, lost somewhere between schoolbooks and growing up.

Fast forward to 2023 — final semester of college. I had just landed my first job/internship, and something rekindled my dormant love for perfumes. It all started with the humble duo: a Nivea body spray and an Old Spice classic. Then came the first salary — and with it, my first scent splurge: Wild Stone Edge, Beardo Mariner, and Beardo Whisky Smoke. To my juvenile nose, they were bottled brilliance.

I still remember spraying Beardo Whisky Smoke all over my shirt before going on a date with my then-girlfriend. I haven’t touched that bottle since — partly because it now smells aggressively synthetic… and partly because, well, we broke up.

Then came my first proper job. A relative gifted me a Titan fragrance set featuring Skinn Verge and Raw. These weren’t just perfumes — they felt like entire moods. Raw, especially, left a mark, and I ended up buying a full bottle. It was my first real fragrance, and it felt like a coming-of-age moment for my scent journey.

Then came the downfall...  
I joined the sub. That’s when things escalated — fast. I bought Lattafa Asad and Khamrah Qahwa, and both completely changed the game for me. They smelled far more refined than anything I had ever experienced. Then came Lattafa Ramz Silver — which, to this day, remains one of my most complimented perfumes.

Fast forward to today, I’ve amassed a collection of nearly 25 full bottles, not counting the decants. What started with a sniff of Dad’s cologne has grown into a full-blown passion.

***My personal Favourite/Most complimented Fragrances:***

* **Reu Broca Theoremme**:  Smells like sipping lemonade in the middle of a spice market. It’s fresh, a bit spicy, and somehow still smooth. Super linear, but sometimes that’s all you need. For a “freshie,” it lasts surprisingly well on my skin

**Smell**: 10/10

**Longevity**: 8.5/10

* **JPG Le male Elixir**: Kingdom introduced me to this DNA, and once I tried the OG, I was hooked. Smells almost identical — just missing the Kingdom's honey note. Strong performance, changing phases, and just beastly overall.

**Smell**: 8.5/10

**Longevity**: 10/10

* **Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa**: ☕ Imagine cold coffee with vanilla ice cream melting into it… and then someone adds rum. The first day I had applied it and went to my female friends PG, all three of her roommates started sniffing me like bloodhounds. Feminine-leaning but insanely long-lasting. 3 sprays MAX or you’re a walking café.

**Smell**: 8/10

**Longevity**: 10/10

* **Azzaro The Most Wanted EDP**: 🍬 Cardamom toffee but still manly. My first designer buy — and still the sexiest thing I own. Has sweetness but isn’t cloying or girly like Khamrah. Perfect date night juice.

**Smell**: 9.5/10

**Longevity:** 8/10

* **Fragrance World Spectre Ghost:** 🍋 Lemon cheesecake meets strong ginger. Coolest bottle in my collection. Very unique scent — might not be for everyone, but definitely stands out in a crowd. Smells like dessert with a punch.

**Smell**: 7.5/10 (10/10 for uniqueness)

**Longevity**: 8/10

* **Lattafa Ramz Silver**: 🍭 Synthetic sweet bomb + vanilla. Used to love this. Now it feels a bit too artificial, but I can’t deny — it’s still my most complimented scent Once, a girl in the bus told me I smelled amazing… right before an old uncle interrupted and took her seat. He gave me the smirk. You know the one. 😑

**Smell**: 6.5/10

**Longevity**: 8/10

* **Titan Skinn Raw**: 🌿 The OG starter pack for Indian noses. This is the fragrance that started it all for me. It smells slightly synthetic but it really works for Indians. 3 of friends purchased it after smelling it on me. I always carry a 20ml travel spray in my backpack like a true addict.

**Smell**: 7.5/10

**Longevity:** 5/10

So after building a decent collection (heavily clone-house powered), I’ve decided to take a little detour — and dip my nose into more designer territory.

🔥 Next on the hitlist:  
**Mancera Cedrat Boisé** and **Versace Eros Flame**

Clone game’s been fun and budget-friendly, but it’s time to slow that roll (before I end up owning 6 versions of Aventus lol). Let’s see how this designer phase goes.

Would love to hear:

* Your thoughts on these two
* Any designer recommendations that punch above their price
* Your own first step into the designer world

I’m hoping to tap into the community’s wisdom to help me discover my next favorite game. I play across PS5, Nintendo Switch, and iPad/Mac (iOS), and I have pretty varied taste, so I’m open to different genres… as long as the vibe is right !

Here’s a breakdown of games I’ve recently loved, organized to make things easier (not in any order or preference, just how I remembered them) :


🎮 PS5 Favorites:

✨ Narrative-Driven Adventures with Action:
	•	Ghost of Tsushima
	•	Uncharted
	•	Forspoken
	•	Spiderman: Miles Morales
	•	Hogwarts Legacy
	•	Split Fiction
	•	It Takes Two
	•	Dreamfall Chapters
	•	Detroit
	•	Red Dead Redemption 2

These all scratched that “explore, fight, and feel something” itch… I love getting immersed in story-rich, cinematic worlds with satisfying combat and a bit of magic or mystery.

🌿 Indie/Chill/Quirky Exploration:
	•	Carto
	•	Stray
	•	Lost Records
	•	Wanderstop
	•	Call of the Sea

I really enjoy smaller, creative titles with a unique tone or art style. Some are emotional, some are just plain cozy, but I appreciate when games try something fresh.

🌊 Offbeat, atmospheric experiences:
	•	Dredge : I loved the mix of cozy and creepy. More of this vibe would be awesome.



📱 iPad/Mac (iOS) Favorites:
	•	Outlanders 1 & 2
	•	Hello Kitty Island Adventure
	•	Townsfolk
	•	Don’t Starve
	•	Coffee Inc 2
	•	Japan Rural
	•	Sasquatch
	•	Twelve Minutes
	•	Cozy Grove 1 & 2
	•	Stardew Valley

Here I lean heavily into cozy management, slice-of-life, quirky sims, and offbeat storytelling. I like games that let me build something over time or immerse me in a strange little world. Some are relaxing, others just charmingly weird, but I’m into both.



🎮 Nintendo Switch:
	•	Disney Dreamlight Valley
Only just started it, but I can already tell I’ll enjoy the relaxed life-sim pace with some nostalgia sprinkled in.



So in short… I like:
	•	Story-driven action/adventure with good worldbuilding (big name games or other)
	•	Cozy sims and slice-of-life games
	•	Wholesome vibes OR eerie but atmospheric
	•	Quirky, creative indies that feel unique
	•	Bonus points for anything that blends genres in interesting ways

If you’ve played something recently that gave you similar feelings, I’d love to hear your recommendations. Whether it’s a hidden gem or a popular game I somehow missed, I’m open to anything that matches the vibes above! In case it’s relevant, I’m 29 years old. 

Thanks so much in advance 💛

* The café is built from steel containers, iron framing, and tempered glass – bringing a solid, raw, and unmistakably industrial feel. 
* The ground floor features a monochrome marble counter, track lighting, and quirky neon signs like “ON AIR” and “hello…” – creating a cozy yet modern urban chill vibe.

* Scattered around are lightweight metal tables and chairs surrounded by potted greenery – blending nature with urban edge. 
* Exposed steel beams, hanging bulbs, and simple lines create a sense of retreat – like stepping out of the noise into a calm, private pocket. 
* A small projecting container pod on the second floor adds a cozy corner for relaxation – turning the café into a hidden urban sanctuary.

1lcynwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1lcynwz/i_need_some_motivation_and_advice/,I need some motivation and advice,"Hello, 

  
I recently finished a short story for the first time in my life ( technically ) 

Id love to hear what you guys think of it and would love some feedback.   
CW: The story involves sex, but it’s lightly implied, as well as an age- gap relationship between an authority person and their student. It’s all vague and implied on purpose

—————————————————————————————————————————————————

His apartment was near campus, not particularly small. Nonetheless, his solitude was obvious in every room.

The bathroom was sparsely furnished. The vanity, with its narrow enamel basin, had seen better days. In several places, the white coating had peeled off, and especially around the faucet, the surface was worn and shabby. 

As I sat there, on the closed toilet lid, legs crossed, my sandals - the soles were *far* too narrow - resting on the floor before me, I found myself wondering if he’d ever had a woman in this apartment.                                                                                                            Nothing even remotely suggested it.

I got up and walked barefoot across to the vanity. Above it, a mirrored cabinet. I opened it - the hinge squeaked - and found only a few items inside, half of which didn’t even belong in a bathroom.

A bottle of mouthwash stood next to a toothbrush; in a glass an old comb, and beside it a notepad, most pages torn out.                                       

On top of it were three pencils, two of which were useless — one had a broken tip, the other was too short. There was also a bottle of his aftershave, the scent of which I could only tolerate in the smallest of doses.

On the grimy shelf at the bottom of the cabinet lay a tarnished wristwatch. I remember raising my eyebrows when I first saw it — it was so *dainty,* so unmistakably *feminine,* but the strap was too short to have belonged to any adult woman. No, it looked like a *child’s* watch, and as I examined it more closely, I recognized the faded design of a Flik Flak: a zigzag pattern with tiny crooked stars and hearts scattered between the lines.

I placed the watch back on the shelf and closed the cabinet with a slight, mildly repulsed deliberation.                                                                                  

I looked at myself in the mirror. Then, I reached into my handbag on the windowsill and pulled out rouge and lipstick, applying both with a kind of relaxed laziness. I looked at myself one last time, then decided not to keep him waiting any longer.

He was sitting on the couch, reading an article from one of the newspapers he’d left on the coffee table. I sat down silently beside him, peering over his shoulder with feigned interest. He lay his hand on my thigh, then took it away. 

“Would you like something to drink?” he asked, and I smiled, first looking into his eyes, then at his nose, then his lips.  
“Maybe a coffee.”

He got up and went to the kitchen, making no sign that I should follow. I rose anyway and trotted after him.

The kitchen was just as sparsely furnished as everything else. On the counter sat a coffee machine, next to it a hook with linen towels, a knife block, and a wooden cutting board.

As the machine hummed, he went to the fridge.  
“Milk? Sugar?”

I normally took mine with lots of milk and three spoons of sugar.  
“Nothing. Just black.”

He nodded solemnly, and when the machine had filled the white cup halfway, he placed it in front of me. Then he sat down across from me at the kitchen table, flanked by three chairs. For a literary man, he had surprisingly good posture - his back wasn’t hunched or slouched. His hands rested flat on the table, his dark hair was neatly combed, and he looked like the cliché of what he was: mysterious, and - at that moment - deeply unsettling. I looked at him, then down at the coffee.

“You know, this kind of situation isn’t all that unusual.”  
“Yeah. I know.”  
“You’re quite pretty, you know that?”

He stood and walked over to the window across from the table. He pulled a cigarette case from his trouser pocket and lit one with a match from the sill. He looked at me. Then his gaze subverted stoically to the  wall.

“Are you a virgin?”

The bluntness of the question hit like a slap to the back of my neck, and I looked back down at the cup. The combination of strong coffee, cigarette smoke, and that unbearable aftershave made me nauseous.

“Yes,” I lied, assuming that was the preferred answer. But I was wrong - for a split second, a flicker of shame or disgust crossed his drawn face before disappearing, replaced by a look of interest.

“Remind me, what was the short story we analyzed last month?”  
“Which one do you mean? The one with the dying cat or—?”  
“No, not *that* one.” He cut me off as he remembered.  
*“For Esmé – with Love and Squalor.”*  
“Right. *For Esmé – with Love and Squalor.*”  
“Did you like it?”  
“Very much. But I already knew it.”

I took a sip of the now lukewarm coffee. It tasted awful, and I masked my revulsion with a dry cough.

‘’Its a very sad story But very pretty. The last sentences, they just *shake* you’’, dragged more pürolonged at the cigarette, until he noticed my coughing fit.

“Should I stop smoking?” he asked, a hint of concern in his voice, and I shook my head.  
“No, its fine, doesn’t bother me.”

He looked at me as if I were an unsolvable paradox.  


“I’m guessing you like Salinger?”  
“In parts. I didn’t like *The Catcher in the Rye*. But I do like his stories about the Glass family.”  
“Yeah? Well, young women usually aren’t very receptive to Salinger. Especially not to *Catcher in the Rye*.”  
“Mhm.”  
“You could tell in the lecture, too. How many of your classmates pulled a face.”  


“Mh-hm,” I nodded and grinned. I *had* seen their faces and I *had* felt a sense of superiority over them. 

“Do you have a favorite story of his?”, I asked, one finger playing with the pearl teardrop of my earring, in an attempt to calm my nervous system through plastic material.

  
He looked at me, walked back to the table, sat down across from me, and kept smoking. I liked looking at him like that much better - I was almost staring - then he took my hand in his.

*“For Esmé.* Or *A Girl I Knew.* Do you have one? A favorite, I mean.”  


“*Teddy* and *Franny*. He writes children *wonderfully*’’.  


""Hm. It fits you, really.”

‘’Does it?’’, I asked and smiled weakly. His hand was warm and I held mine as still as I could without going stiff. I feared he would pull away any second.

He laughed and squeezed my hand a little tighter, traced his thumb over my ring finger. I wore a slim silver ring with a heart-shaped stone inlay. He circled its edges.

“You know, Salinger likes his partners younger. A lot of writers and academics do. I mean,” - he took a drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke beside me, careful not to blow it in my face -  
“- obviously I can’t speak for everyone; but maybe it has to do with innocence. Sometimes -” it seemed like he was searching for the right words.  


“Sometimes it feels like the whole world’s gone completely to hell, and all that’s pure and beautiful has been lost. And then you meet someone,” he squeezed my hand tighter, “who proves the opposite. And maybe she’s younger. But spiritually, she’s on the same level.  
I think that’s the fascination with women like you - one that Salinger and I share.”  


“Mhm.”  


“On that level, Salinger and I are quite similar. He’s also a very reserved man.”

We looked at each other for a brief moment, then I turned my coffee cup in my hands.

  
“But you’re not Salinger,” I said, looking at him intently. Nervousness rose up in me, and I couldn’t suppress it.

He let go of my hand and stubbed his cigarette out in my cup. Then he stood.  
“No. Of course I’m not.”  
He took the half-full cup and let the coffee drain down in the sink. His dreamy manner had shifted into a kind of irritated, manic energy.  


“I’ll tidy up. You can go ahead into the bedroom.”  


I looked at him and listened, but a kind of ressentiment in my head prevented me from standing up. It was as if I was simply glued to the chair.

‘’Should i help?’’

‘’You don't need to. You only drank coffee. My main issue is that I need the *goddamn* smoke out of the room before my housekeeper comes and *berates* me for it again. Just move to the bedroom now, i will be there in a minute’’.

I stood up abruptly, as if his words had been a form of Acetone, and left the kitchen in a slow and sluggish manner. The way to the bedroom was not familiar but as I crossed the bathroom, right next to it was the bedroom door, wide open. 

His bed was neatly made, next to it stood a table and on it several books, a cup and a bright red phone. It was the only thing that gave the room any color, really and as I sat down, I stared towards the bookshelf standing at least 6 feet in the room. At 19, I was slightly nearsighted and couldn't read any of the titles, but they were all bound in leather. 

I unbuttoned the blouse and let it passively slide to the ground. Then I took off the bralette, so embarrassed, I could only continue staring at the wall. As I unclasped, it also fell down to the blouse, and I lay down in the bed. 

I pulled the blanket up to my sides until it covered my chest fully, only stopping at my collarbone. Then I neatly tucked it in.

He stood at the door, merely for a second, and I hadn't noticed him in my tucking endeavor, until he spoke.

‘’Take the blanket down, you're not *five* for god's sake’’

I blinked. He walked over and pulled, yanked the blanket down and revealed my bare upper body. Then his gaze shifted from my face to my chest, and he, still fully dressed, lay beside me. One hand he placed on my stomach,the other behind my head. He leant in for a small, unerotic kiss and then looked at me.But it seems like he didn't really look at me. He just looked at my nose, then back down to my lips and kissed me again, with a form of reverence.

This continued on, the kisses, five by count, becoming more indulgent, until I clearly tasted tobacco and saliva. 

  


And i just couldn't *stand it*

1lcympj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1lcympj/thoughts_on_having_a_work_crush_while_being_in_a/,Thoughts on having a work crush while being in a relationship?,"I have guy best friend at work, who we will call Bro, who is in a long-term committed relationship. I think he’s also planning to propose sa girl friend niya soon. Mahilig lang mangbwiset itong tropa ko na to but I can swear na matino and mabait na tao naman to. Everyone in the team is very comfortable with him and siya talaga madalas na nilalapitan dahil bukod sa one of the top performers siya, mabait naman talaga.

Since last year ang dami nagbago sa team dahil required na ulit kami pumasok twice a week, mas naging close yung team as a whole. Particularly, meron isang girl sa team who I will call Girlypop, na parang na-adopt na namin ni Bro kasi nag-resign na din yung closest friend niya sa team. She’s very introverted and usually nakahiwalay sila ng pwesto nung nandito pa yung closest work friend niya. Ngayon, samin ko na siya pinapatabi, nakakasabay umuwi and nakakasama na din namin siya lumabas.  Ang unexpectedly witty and super funny din kasi ni Girlypop kaya madali and enjoy din talaga siyang kasama.

Recently, nafi-feel ko lang na may hidden crush si Bro kay Girlypop. Hindi ko din siya masisisi kasi ang ideal talaga ni Girlypo. Maganda, matalino, ang likable ng personality, well spoken and one of the top performers in the team. Siya yung lowkey and tahimik lang sa gedli pero ang memorable pa rin ng presence niya. Same lang naman trato niya sa amin na usual asaran ng magtotropa. But one of the things na napapansin ko is lagi niya nababanggit and napupuna si Girlypop regardless kung kasama namin siya or hindi. Even sa GC namin with our work friends na resigned na and hindi naman naging ka-close si Girlypop nababanggit niya pa din. Isa pa sa na-notice ko is lagi siya nagi-insist na isama si Girlypop. For example, if mag-coffee break, meron ako mga workmates na mahilig magpasuyo sa amin na magpabili and Bro would always say sure pero kapag si Girlypop na, he would insist na sumama na lang siya. Another instance is, meron vacancy sa project na hinahandle namin due to resignation and ang agad na ni-recommend ni Bro na pumalit is si Girlypop even though meron kami other very close work friend (mas close pa namin kay Girlypop) who previously expressed interest to join us.

As someone who is also in a long-term relationship, napaisip lang ako how I would feel if  I find out that my fiancé admires someone at his workplace and medyo kumirot ang heart ko. I trust Bro naman and wala naman ako nakikitang mali or inappropriate sa mga actions niya towards Girlypop. It just really got me thinking as someone who is newly engaged 😂

Any thoughts? Tama ba hinala ko? ",0,1750094071.0,CasualPH,0,0.5,False
1lcymnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/hungarian/comments/1lcymnj/looking_for_someone_to_learn_hungarian_with_in/,Looking for someone to learn Hungarian with in Budapest,"Hi,

This is my first Reddit post so please forgive me if my formatting is poor, or if this post belongs in another sub.

I'm in Budapest for the summer to learn Hungarian, but I haven't made as much progress so far as I would've liked. I only have a month left now and I don't want to waste this opportunity to speak in-person with native speakers. I am getting a little bit desperate as I'm only at about 1500 words and I'm conversationally very very poor.

Would anyone that lives in Budapest be willing to meet a few times for some basic conversations? We could do a coffee shop, or some other public area, and I'd be happy to pay for coffee. I'm also happy to meet with any type of person - age, gender, or otherwise (as long as you speak Hungarian well lol).

If this post isn't appropriate here please let me know where I can post instead :)

Thanks!",2,1750094067.0,hungarian,0,1.0,False
1lcymmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lcymmh/i_stole_my_own_identity_and_i_think_my_family_is/,I stole my own identity and I think my family is getting suspicious.,"It was late September when I had returned home. I had just come back from a summer camp that lasted two months. I couldn't tell you much about the camp or its counselors. I know I had a good time, except when I got lost during a group nature hike. When I finally was able to find my way back to camp, it was late, and no one was in camp. 

When I returned home, my parents were surprised to see me.

""M-Max... you're home?"" My mother asked.

 She slowly approached me and looked me up and down. She then dropped to her knees and hugged me. I could see my father standing in the doorway looking at both of us; he swiftly turned and locked himself in the den. 

He must have still been angry with me. Before summer camp, I had broken into his gun cabinet with some friends from school. My friend Benny accidentally pulled the trigger of one of the guns and shot a hole in the wall. No one was hurt, but my friends scattered, leaving me with the smoking gun. When my dad found out what had happened, I got the lecture of a lifetime. 

""Do you have any idea how stupid that was? You're extremely lucky no one was hurt!"" He scolded.

 ""I'd ground you, but I'm just glad you'll be out of my sight for the next two months!"" He then kicked me out of the den and sent me to my room without dinner.

 A knock at my door startled me as I was looking at some magazines Benny had snuck me during class. I opened the door to see my sister, Ryleigh, standing there with a plate of food. 

""Mom said to sneak you a plate."" She said, pushing the plate into my chest.

 She was taller than me, but I would assume her big, colorful hair that reeked of hairspray helped to contribute to her height. I looked her up and down, seeing her wearing her jean jacket vest with her 'Black Sabbath' shirt underneath. Her neck was weighed down by the several necklaces she frequently wore.

 ""Are you going out?"" I had asked. 

""No, twerp, I just dress this way and put on war paint before I go to lala land."" She sneered.

 ""Do Mom and Dad know?"" I asked, chewing through some broccoli.

 ""They don't, and you better not tell them either."" She whispered. ""Or I'll tell Mom about your noody mags, you little perv."" 

She had me dead to rights. I nodded, agreeing to keep my mouth shut. Later that night, after my parents went to bed, I heard the window open from Ryleigh's room. I went back to bed. The next morning, I came down for breakfast: pancakes, eggs, and bacon, a weekend staple for my family. My dad already sat at the table, coffee in front of him, his nose in the paper. He never said a word to anyone until his second cup of coffee, but today, he was extra silent. Must still be angry with me.

 Ryleigh didn't come down for breakfast, normal for nights she sneaks out. 

""Are you excited about going to summer camp, sweetie?"" My mom has asked.

 I nodded as I stuffed my face with bacon.

 ""Will your friend Benny be there with us?"" She asked, putting down a plate of food for my dad. 

""No, he ended up getting summer school."" I said, looking back at my mom. I could hear my father scoff from behind his paper; he never liked Benny, said he was a bad influence.

 It wasn't until the early afternoon when Ryleigh finally came downstairs, still wearing her 'Black Sabbath' shirt from last night, her hair a mess, and her makeup mostly cleaned off with the slightest hint of eyeliner. She shot me a look as she grabbed a plate covered in plastic wrap from inside the microwave; she then sat down next to me on the couch and watched cartoons with me. 

""What time are you supposed to be leaving?"" She asked.

 ""Ummmm, I think 2pm?"" I answered, not entirely sure.

 ""What is the name of the camp?"" She asked. 

""Ummmm, Camp Mannatari I think it's called."" I answered.

 ""Oh, that's it in Sleepy Falls. I remember we went there once on a family vacation; you were like two years old when we went. It was a weird place."" She said.

""Weird how?"" I questioned. 

""I don't know; I just remember something not right about that place. Maybe it was just because I was seven at the time; the world seems a lot bigger and stranger when you're a kid."" She laughed.

""You're still a kid."" I quipped. 

""Yeah, yeah. I graduate next year, and I'll likely be moving away for college. Mom will be devastated. Look out for her, okay?"" She said, ruffling up my brown curls with her fingers. 

I could smell the faint scent of cigarettes stained on her fingers. I tried cigarettes once with Benny; I felt like the inside of my throat was being punched by a fist that was on fire. 

It was about 2:14pm when a bus pulled up to the house with 'Camp Mannatari' written on the side of it. I hugged my sister, and my mom kissed the top of my head. My dad was there to see me off, but he didn't say anything, didn't even shake my hand like he normally would do whenever I went somewhere for a long time.It was about a four-hour drive until we reached the small town of Sleepy Falls. 

The bus weaved through the winding streets of the market district of the town. The townspeople all would come out of the shops to see the bus drive by. None of them waved or smiled; they just looked at us. When we reached the treeline for the forest, it was another 20 minutes until we reached the camp. The counselors greeted us at the bunkhouses and commanded us to gather our belongings and head to our designated bunks. 

The first few days at camp were mostly just a tour of the camp. It had a lake with boats and fishing, various tables for eating and crafts, an archery area, a go-cart track, and a garden. There was a hiking trail that would lead deeper into the forest. By the fourth night, the counselors sat us by a fire to share ghost stories. 

""Ms. Keen, could you tell us about how the camp got its name?"" One kid asked. 

The young counselor known as Ms. Keen was only a few years older than my own sister, with straight red hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. 

""Of course, so the town of Sleepy Falls was founded by European settlers in the 15th century. There was a local legend about a forest guardian known as the Mannatari that would stalk the forest and abduct those who wandered into the woods. No one knows if this legend was brought over by the European settlers or if it was a story created by the local tribes. Some say it's some sort of fae; others say it's a spirit. She explained. 

I raised my hand to gain an answer to the question that began to swell my brain. 

""Yes... Max, was it?"" She said, pointing at me.

""Why would they name the camp after a monster that abducts people?"" I asked.

""I believe it was in honor of the creature's benevolent behavior as a protector of the forest."" She answered. 

""Now, how would you all like to hear the story of the Horseman from Hell?"" She asked. 

The kids cheered, ready for the next scary story. I didn't pay much attention to the rest of the night. When we all turned in for bed, I just thought about how much I already missed home: my mom, Ryleigh, even my dad.

The next couple of months were just regularly scheduled events. A couple of weeks before the end of camp, Ms. Keen became sick. She stayed in her bunkhouse most days, only occasionally being seen from her window, watching us play. Eventually we stopped seeing her. I asked another counselor what had happened to her. 

""Oh, Ms. Keen? We had to send her to the hospital. She was really sick and not getting any better."" He answered. 

""Will she be back before the end of camp?"" I asked.

""N-no...M-maybe next year."" He answered. ""Hey, uh, no more questions; let's get ready for one of our last nature hikes."" He said. 

The hike was like all the others: same trail, same trees, same plants. During the hike, I started to lag behind a bit, daydreaming about what happened to Ms. Keen and thinking about how by the end of the week, I'll be back home. I hope my dad isn't still mad at me. 

""Mah...Mah...Max,"" a voice reached out from behind a tree.

 I stopped in my tracks, looking around, but I didn't see anyone.

 ""Mah-Max."" The voice said again. I recognized that voice, even though I hadn't heard it in three weeks; it was Ms. Keen. 

""Ms. Keen? Is that you?"" I asked.

 ""P-please help me...Y-you don't have to do this."" Ms. Keen said.

""P-please follow me, children."" She called to me.

""Guys! Hey, I found Ms. Keen! I think she's hurt."" I yelled to the group ahead of me, but they didn't hear me.

 I decided to follow the voice to find Ms. Keen; if she was hurt, I could help her using the first aid skills I learned from one of the camp events. I followed the voice further into the forest, farther away from the trail. Before I knew it, I got turned around; I was lost. I never found Ms. Keen. I decided to backtrack the best I could back to the camp. Somehow, someway, I made it back.

I was still being embraced by my mother; she was crying on my shoulder. I could feel her hot breath from her wails against me, her tears slowly dripping into my shirt. From the den, I heard a loud pop sound. It was a similar sound to when Benny accidentally shot the gun in there months ago, just more muffled. I could hear rumbling coming from the stairs as Ryleigh came running down then.

""What the fuck happened?"" She cried. She came and stopped in the doorway as soon as she saw me. 

""R-ryleigh..."" I said as I pulled myself away from my mother's grasp, she collapsed to her hands and knees as she cried even harder into the tile. 

""What the fuck?!"" She screamed as she turned around and ran back upstairs and slammed her bedroom door.

 I walked over to the phone on the wall and picked it up and listened. I could hear Ryleigh's ragged breath, her trying to hold back tears.

 ""911, what is your emergency?"" A voice asked. 

""Hello? Please send help! I'm at 3232 W. Holly Ln."" She said desperately.

""What is happening there?"" The operator asked.

""It's my brother. He's downstairs with my mother. I think my father shot himself."" She cried.

""Your father shot himself, ok, we'll send a cruiser and an ambulance your way."" The operator said.

""No, that's not it; my brother disappeared a month ago at summer camp. They found his body in the woods; we buried him last week. That THING downstairs is not my brother!"" She screamed, her voice finally breaking down in cries of both sadness and fear.

1lcykb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/groupSense/comments/1lcykb2/first_time_noticing_how_mood_shifts_how_people/,First time noticing how mood shifts how people treat service staff,"So, I noticed something interesting while grabbing coffee the other day. The way people treat service staff like baristas seems to really depend on their mood or how important they think they are at that moment. 

I was standing in line, feeling a bit groggy, and couldn't help but eavesdrop on the guy in front of me who was clearly having a rough morning. He was super short with the barista, barely saying thanks. It kinda got me thinking... is it just that when people are stressed or feel low, they take it out on others? Or could it be a status thing, like trying to feel important by bossing others around when you're kinda feeling down—reminds me a bit of displacement or projection I've heard about in psych classes.

Then there's this lady behind him who was all smiles and chatty even before her coffee hit. I swear, treating someone nicely must work like a mood booster... for both sides, tbh. I'm guessing when folks feel good, they spread that good vibe, and when they're stressed, not so much.

I wonder if there's some underlying psychology theory for that, or if it's just my over-caffeinated mind making connections. Anyone else think that how we see ourselves, even day-to-day, affects how we treat folks around us, like waiters and baristas? 🤔",8,1750093924.0,groupSense,0,1.0,False

Hey :) I’m 29, based somewhere in Europe, and currently surviving adulthood with questionable sleep habits and a suspicious amount of coffee. I don’t have it all figured out, but I’ve accepted that maybe nobody does—and that’s kind of comforting, in a chaotic, existential way.

I’m introverted by default, which means I might come off quiet at first. But give me a little time and suddenly I’m sending you voice notes at 1AM explaining why a sad song made me think about the universe (and probably three memes to balance it out). I open up through music, long chats, and shared weirdness.

I have a soft spot for good soundtracks and bad movies. One moment I’m overanalyzing a cinematic masterpiece, the next I’m watching a rom-com so awful it feels like a social experiment. If you enjoy quoting bad dialogue with alarming accuracy, I already like you.

My playlists are all over the place—soft indie, dramatic orchestral stuff, chaotic boss battle energy, then lo-fi to recover from the emotional whiplash. I game a bit too—mostly story-driven stuff that makes me feel things. Occasionally I’ll jump into multiplayer chaos just to see what happens (spoiler: I probably fall off the map).

I read, write, and fall into bizarre YouTube rabbit holes about topics I forget in two days but feel very strongly about in the moment. Creativity is part of my daily life, even if half of it stays in my head or unfinished Google Docs.

Right now I’m just looking to meet someone kind, curious, and open to genuine connection. I don’t have a checklist or expectations carved in stone—just someone who enjoys real conversation, has a good sense of humor, and doesn’t mind diving into the silly or the deep (ideally both). I’m not here with a five-year plan or a relationship ultimatum, but I’m definitely open to where things naturally go. If the universe decides to throw some chemistry our way and it turns into something more, I’m absolutely up for it.

Extra points if you’re into movie nights, music swaps, random voice chats, and existential rambling mixed with sarcasm. If you're the kind of person who can send a meme and then talk about the meaning of time, we’ll get along just fine. And if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel, I’m more than happy to switch platforms.

Why message me? Because you’re tired of ghosters and dry texters. Because you want a real conversation with someone who actually listens and replies with intention. Or because you saw the word “existential” and thought, “Yep, that’s me.”

At worst, we have a fun chat. At best… who knows?
Either way, I’m friendly, I reply, and I probably already have a meme ready for this moment.",2,1750093888.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1lcyjol,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1lcyjol/at_my_wits_end_with_litter_box_problems/,At my wits end with litter box problems,"We recently (less than a year ago) took in a stray cat. She is almost a year old and has been the absolute best cat ever. Super calm, loves scratches, great with our kids and dogs. She has never had any health issues and has always used the litter box just fine up until a few days ago.

Since we have dogs, we have a hooded litter box with a little swinging door. The other morning I woke up and the door had been broken off the litter box. I went and purchased a new litter box. It is the same exact litter box. Like identical down to the color lol. I didn’t even replace the litter box pan or the litter, just the top. She is now refusing to use the litter box.

We got her checked out since I was worried about a UTI, and she is perfectly healthy. She just will not stop peeing and pooping on anything soft that is left on the floor. I have picked up all rugs and mats, all the dog beds, shoes, and put all the throw blankets up in our linen closet so she doesn’t have anything to potty on. She will just hold it until she can’t any longer.

We have a lab who makes a huge mess with water after taking a drink. I used a towel to dry up the water mess, picked up a paper plate off the coffee table, and walked 2 feet away to drop it in the trash can. I turned back around and she was already peeing on the towel that had been on the ground for 15 seconds! HELP! What do I do next?! I just can’t keep cleaning up accidents every day and I have no idea where to go from here! 

TLDR: perfectly healthy almost 1 year old cat stopped using litter box after replacing just the top hooded part and keeping the same pan and littler. ",1,1750093886.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

1lcyj13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1lcyj13/i_was_kidnapped_by_my_dads_drug_dealer/,I was kidnapped by my dads drug dealer,"I won’t lie. As a kid I always wanted to talk about my trauma. I think it always made it feel less real, like I’m telling a story. It was downplayed by my family. The validation of other people being shocked or empathetic is something I sought as a kid. I learned to be careful who I told. As an adult while finally healing I’ve started to feel this again.

This is such a weird story. My memory is missing so many bits due to the adrenaline of it. I remember most of it clear as day. I was maybe 14 when this happened? 

My basement bedroom was next to the tweaker lady my dad had a thing for and moved into our house. This guy, *****, my dad’s friend was loitering around the basement. Our house was always crawling with twacked out people. I opened my door and he was by it and he turned and asked “You still babysit, right?” Weird because I hadn’t know this guy long. I had a babysitting job a few years ago. I chalked all of this up to the usual cracktivities. I told him I did and he said he had a job for me. 

We went upstairs where he finished his business with my parents. He asked if they’d mind if he walked me a couple blocks to the apartment building he owned to speak with a tenant who needed a babysitter. They agreed and we started walking that way. It’s the middle of the night. We start walking a weird way, but still mostly in the right direction. We get about a block and a half away and he starts yelling to get down and hide. I was so scared I listened as we crawled through yards and ran from who knows?? 

We run into an apartment. There’s no one in there and it’s dark. He says the people were moving out. He turned around and locked 6 locks on the door. He told me the people with the babysitting job lived upstairs and he’s waiting on them to get back. 

He showed me the house. It felt like he was trying walk me into a room to block me in. He tried to lure me to the basement, but I followed about halfway down the stairs and saw a cat. I snatched it up and for the rest of the night I clutched this cat and didn’t let go. I ran up the stairs and he followed. 

We sat in an empty room and he started showing me pictures of women in bikinis and painted on clothes. Then there was screaming and banging. I couldn’t what they were saying. He told me to hide in the bedroom. 

He shut me in and I cracked the door to peek out. All of the lights were off, but from the little bit of light peering in I could see him crawling around on the floor. Then I heard the gun cock. He crawled into the room and picked a mattress up and blocked a window with it. 

He called the cops and said “someone is beating on my door and screaming.” He made me lay in the bed with him “in case the cops look in the window it’ll just look like we’re in bed.” The cops came by, knocked, shined lights, and left. 

I watched him send frantic texts to my parents. It was an act. He was sending the messages to a fake number.  His phone kept ringing and he kept ignoring it. It was my dad. He continued the crawling around peeking out windows. 

Then I heard my dad’s truck and screeching tires. Then the yelling. I recognized it, it was my dad. Screaming “Where the fuck is my daughter! Where is she! Where is *****?” I heard him screaming my name and then I heard him kick in the upstairs door. I started losing it telling him I needed to go to my dad. 

This guy shut me in a closet and told me not to come out for 10 minutes. I heard him run out the front door. Keep in mind, I’m still clutching this cat, I have not let the poor thing step away for a second. As soon as I heard the door close I ran out of the closet and out of the bedroom. Fumbling around in this dark house trying to find the door. I had to fiddle with all of the locks. I ran out into the alley to see my mom, dad, aunt, brother, and my mom’s friend. My dad’s got a shotgun chasing this guy down the street. 

My mom walked me home and made me a coffee. Big stuff as I never saw her for more than 5 minutes in a day if at all. My dad finally returned and sat on the floor in front of the couch rocking and crying and apologizing while filling his torch with butane. Idk why that detail pissed me off so much, but it did. 

This cat, still with me, sleeping on my chest. I kept him and I named him dog. My mom told me we could just get rid of him and find another because of the bad attachment. No way. 

Every time I left the house after this I could’ve swore I saw him creeping around in his janky ass red jeep. I imagine partly it was paranoia, but I know for certain a few times it really was him circling my house. 

Fun addition to this. My other brother ended out renting this apartment not knowing that this was where all of this went down. To spend time with him I had to confront the place and eventually ended out spending quite a lot of time there. ",2,1750093843.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

Positive Reviews: Many users report significant improvements in digestion and skin appearance, with fewer digestive issues and clearer skin.

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, “I would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!”

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It’s simply unbelievable!”

Positive Reviews: Many users report significant improvements in digestion and skin appearance, with fewer digestive issues and clearer skin.

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

1lcyh23,https://i.redd.it/whojxoy5nb7f1.jpeg,"Looking for a new game – PS5, iPad/Mac, or Nintendo Switch – help me find my next obsession!","Hi everyone!
I’m hoping to tap into the community’s wisdom to help me discover my next favorite game. I play across PS5, Nintendo Switch, and iPad/Mac (iOS), and I have pretty varied taste, so I’m open to different genres… as long as the vibe is right!

Here’s a breakdown of games I’ve recently loved, organized to make things easier (not in any order or preference, just how I remembered them) :


🎮 PS5 Favorites:

✨ Narrative-Driven Adventures with Action:
	•	Ghost of Tsushima
	•	Uncharted
	•	Forspoken
	•	Spiderman: Miles Morales
	•	Hogwarts Legacy
	•	Split Fiction
	•	It Takes Two
	•	Dreamfall Chapters
	•	Detroit
	•	Red Dead Redemption 2

These all scratched that “explore, fight, and feel something” itch… I love getting immersed in story-rich, cinematic worlds with satisfying combat and a bit of magic or mystery.

🌿 Indie/Chill/Quirky Exploration:
	•	Carto
	•	Stray
	•	Lost Records
	•	Wanderstop
	•	Call of the Sea

I really enjoy smaller, creative titles with a unique tone or art style. Some are emotional, some are just plain cozy, but I appreciate when games try something fresh.

🌊 Offbeat, atmospheric experiences:
	•	Dredge : I loved the mix of cozy and creepy. More of this vibe would be awesome.



📱 iPad/Mac (iOS) Favorites:
	•	Outlanders 1 & 2
	•	Hello Kitty Island Adventure
	•	Townsfolk
	•	Don’t Starve
	•	Coffee Inc 2
	•	Japan Rural
	•	Sasquatch
	•	Twelve Minutes
	•	Cozy Grove 1 & 2
	•	Stardew Valley

Here I lean heavily into cozy management, slice-of-life, quirky sims, and offbeat storytelling. I like games that let me build something over time or immerse me in a strange little world. Some are relaxing, others just charmingly weird, but I’m into both.



🎮 Nintendo Switch:
	•	Disney Dreamlight Valley
Only just started it, but I can already tell I’ll enjoy the relaxed life-sim pace with some nostalgia sprinkled in.



So in short… I like:
	•	Story-driven action/adventure with good worldbuilding (big name games or other)
	•	Cozy sims and slice-of-life games
	•	Wholesome vibes OR eerie but atmospheric
	•	Quirky, creative indies that feel unique
	•	Bonus points for anything that blends genres in interesting ways

If you’ve played something recently that gave you similar feelings, I’d love to hear your recommendations. Whether it’s a hidden gem or a popular game I somehow missed, I’m open to anything that matches the vibes above!

(I added a little pic to help my post reach you wonderful people ❤️)

Thanks so much in advance 💛

 Just putting this to test waters. and before anyone comments. yes i have literal brain damage which makes grammar hard for me lol.  its not the full chapter, alittle under half. as i am only aiming for 2-3 k per chapter.

Chapter one - The Twin of the Boy who lived.



“Harry, it's time to get up.” a woman’s voice called from the doorway. The woman smiled as she heard the boy grumble. and then she looked down at the small girl at her feet.” Go ahead.” Lily smiled as she watched her daughter pad in to wake her big brother, and moved to walk down the stairs to check on Charles and start breakfast.	 



The sound of the door being opened and young feet padding in was what should have woken up Harry even more, His younger sister was able to pounce on the side of his bed before he woke, causing it to rock and wake her older brother. 



“Harry.! Mom sent me to wake you up”  



Elizabeth giggled as she ducked out of the way of her brother throwing a Pillow at her even the eight-year-old ducked out laughing knowing she had gotten her brother up, hearing Harry grumbling as he sat up.



Harry sat up as he heard his sister run off and down the Stairs, most likely towards the kitchen for breakfast.  Getting up and moving to brush his teeth and wash up he moved down the stairs to see what was for breakfast, becoming more excited as he practically ran down the stairs remembering what today was. 



“ Mom! Why did you let me sleep in!” he called upset as today was the Day he and Charles were going shopping for their school supplies.



Rounding the Corner he saw a display that was common in their household but made the young man go a little green at the gills.” Dad! Mom.! “ he said catching his parents kissing and giving each other small whispers outside the kitchen.



Like any child his age, he didnt want to think about or realize his parents did. Or could be doing. He moved in to find his Siblings already at the table eating even as he left his parents laughing behind him and breaking the kiss to whisper more.



Charles was already there and eating. That made sense as his bedroom was near the kitchen and on the first floor.  Charle's cane was leaning on the table beside him. He smiled up seeing his twin. The two looked very similar except he had deep brown hair and eyes like his father. And of course, his forehead did not have the scar that Harry had.



“ You’re looking well. “ Harry moved over to wrap an arm over his sickly brother giving him a quick hug as before he made his own plate. Charles was thinner than him, having been unable to go out and play as much. But Harry looked out for his less healthy twin at school so no one said anything to him about it.



 James jr looked up from his plate, a healthy boy of seven. He was the spitting image of his father at that age, except he had bright blue eyes he had gotten from one of his maternal grandparents. His dad had joked they had two sets of twins, as Elizabeth and James were ‘Irish twins’. Though Elizabeth or Lizzy as she was known looked more like her mom with short red hair except soft warm brown eyes.



A moment later James came in laughing about something as he moved to ruffle Harry's untamable hair, the other children laughed at their dad as Harry gave him a Look.



"" One Day. you'll understand why i like girls."" He teased his son even as he moved to Make himself a Coffee, Lily just moved to sit down by the younger two. "" We were invited to Dudley's Party today.  "" The kids all gave her a look of horror. "" But, since we were already busy. I told her we couldn't Make it, and we sent gifts from us all "", Which caused all four kids to almost look relieved. 



James shook his head as he made both his and Lil's coffee, he never understood how Lily and Petunia had made up and now were even friendly, But He would rather go to one of those muggle doctors and get his teeth drilled than spend time with Vernon willingly. At least with Severus it made more sense.



"" I talked Uncle Moony into watching the business without me today."" He said as he moved to sit by Lily handing her a coffee and getting a kiss on the cheek for it. "" So i could come help your mom with shopping."" 



"" Thank God, Marcey was going to meet me to help too as she just has Lavender,  We both got off, Darcy has the recruits covering the shifts for us,"" Lily said before taking a sip of her drink. "" She was also going meet to help."" She didn't add more as she didn't need to. Everyone at the table knew of the one son's health issues . Lily's eyes darted to the bag, which she had double checked was packed this morning, three times. the bag with Charles medicines and emergency supplies.

"" I am getting better Mom."" Charles said as he looked up from his food.  He was, he could walk alot more now, and actually only needed the one cane to be careful. Part of why the parents were letting him go to Hogwarts.



"" Though I am sure Both would love to still meet up with us, And have lunch with you to help carry our Bags."" She teased her husband, as she once took him out to the muggle world also making him help carry the bags, and not allowing him to shrink them as she did. 



James gave her a small look, a smirk given as he shook his head. Then smiled at her in a way that caused her to just pause and then smile back knowing the two of them would be dealing with that little comment later away from the kids. "" So who's watching James and Lizzy?""



He watched the four children just eat and joke around.. as his wife answered. "" Janet from down the street, i have the house ready for a Muggle to watch them, and the kids promise to be good."" she looked over to the youngest two who just grinned back in a way that showed they would, even if it meant bribing later.

James shook his head, once again wondering how Lily had convinced him to live in a muggle neighborhood, though he was sure it had to do with that smile and what it suggested just a moment ago. He would admit though, it was calmer and his kids got to see a broader world. even if they hid their magic from their friends and the neighborhood. ",6,1750093676.0,HPfanfiction,0,1.0,False
1lcyg65,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcyg65,"Renaissance Del Monte Lodge by Rochester, New York","The Renaissance Del Monte Lodge is probably the best chain option in Rochester, New York. The location itself is about 15 minutes by car from downtown Rochester and is in a small village on the banks of the Erie Canal.

Renaissance, like other Marriott brands, is a bit lost and confused. However, in concept, Renaissance is supposed to be an upscale, 4-star hotel that’s more boutique-like than Marriott’s flagship Marriott brand.

But, if I’m being honest, the Renaissance Del Monte Lodge is just a Fairfield or Courtyard with a considerably better restaurant, a fancy spa, and better décor. The hotel’s AAA rating confirmed my impression. AAA has given it a 3-diamond rating, which is below what you would expect. The Renaissance Del Monte Lodge should have a four-diamond rating from AAA.

Here are some of the issues that I experienced:

No pre-arrival email or welcome letter at check-in.

There is no doorman or bellman to assist with luggage, etc. The front desk offered no assistance.

There appears to be a hotel car, a Cadillac SUV. But no information was given at check-in about its availability, etc. This is why a hotel should do a pre-arrival email or at least provide a welcome letter at check-in.

Similarly, there’s a spa, but you wouldn’t know this as a guest because it’s not promoted and you receive no information about it at check-in. This is another reason for a welcome letter or pre-arrival email.

Speaking of the spa, there’s no pool. I found it somewhat strange that a full-service hotel with a spa doesn’t have a pool. A half-indoor, half-outdoor pool would be fantastic, especially given the pleasant summer weather.

Renaissance properties are supposed to have a “navigator” (what the brand calls a concierge). I didn’t see a concierge desk or any employee other than the front desk clerk.

No newspapers. I didn’t even see a Rochester tourism magazine.

There is no pantry market. So, if you want a Pepsi and the restaurant is closed, your only option is to leave the hotel and go to the nearby gas station.

The in-room amenities are basic. The generic hotel coffeemaker with cheap hotel coffee was provided. In a suite, you would expect maybe an espresso maker. Even in a suite, there wasn’t a stocked mini-bar, wine glasses, or corkscrew.

With one exception, Bonvoy recognition was mediocre to poor.

I booked a king room. Before my arrival, I confirmed a king room on the highest floor with the hotel. At check-in, I was downgraded to a 2-queen room. After complaining to the front desk and invoking the Marriott compensation guarantee, I was “upgraded” to a suite with no apology for the initial downgrade.

I received an unaddressed and unsigned card in my original room that thanked me for staying. There was an F&B amenity consisting of macaroons and Diet Pepsi. While kind, the macaroons are something I don’t eat. I’m a Diet Pepsi addict. I appreciated the Diet Pepsi. My Bonvoy ambassador account has my F&B preferences. Just like downgrading my room, the hotel didn’t try at all. Zero effort. Zero attention to detail. Is it that difficult to provide an in-room F&B amenity based on my preferences? What’s the point of Marriott asking ambassadors for their preferences if they aren’t consulted? I would have rather had extra Diet Pepsi than the macaroons.

My original room and the suite I later received were superficially clean. I say superficially because everything looked clean. **But when you looked a little closer, you started to see things. Hair on furniture. Multiple stains on furniture, like white stains on upholstery. Dirty floors. Mold or mildew in the shower. Scratched, scuffed, cracked, and otherwise damaged flooring, countertops, furniture, etc. Peeling wallpaper.**

The one Bonvoy benefit the hotel delivers well is the breakfast benefit. Platinum and higher can order ANYTHING off the menu. The hotel’s restaurant, the Erie Grill, is a legitimate restaurant, and the food, both for breakfast and dinner, is very good to excellent. The wine list, in particular, is spectacular for a hotel restaurant in the suburbs of Rochester. 

Speaking of the restaurant, the only issue with the restaurant is its size. It is a very small space. Reservations for dinner and Sunday brunch are highly recommended. However, guests wouldn’t know this because there’s no welcome letter or pre-arrival email. I was also surprised by the lack of outdoor seating. The restaurant faces the Erie Canal. There’s a nice pathway out there with lots of foot traffic. Four or five outdoor tables would be a nice addition.

All things considered, the Renaissance Del Monte Lodge is trying to be an upscale hotel but comes considerably short of what you expect. Especially given the prices. The night I stayed, the suite I received as an upgrade was almost $700 per night. That’s a lot of money for a suite, given the cleanliness and maintenance issues, the lack of services, and the overall lack of amenities.  ",2,1750093668.0,marriott,0,1.0,False
1lcyfro,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcyfro,Anyone knows why this happens?,"I’ve been using the aeroccino with no issue since January, and it used to create this beautiful, silky, creamy foam (second picture) on the hot setting I use for my parents’ coffee, but now it comes looking bubbly and thin 🥲 (first picture).

I’m using the same whole milk brand which I always use out of the fridge, the aeroccino is perfectly clean, the temperature comes as hot/warm as it was before, but the foam is nowhere to be found!

That being said, with my lactose free milk it still creates foam in both cold and hot setting.

The only difference is the weather, in January and early spring it used to be 20°- 30°, and now it’s sooo hot, currently 35° in the morning and goes up to 45°. Could that be the reason why it isn’t foaming the way it used to?",2,1750093645.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False

1lcydqc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcydqc,Would you keep reading (First Chapter blues),"Hi friends! 

I finished my first novel and started querying a few months ago. Although I've received a couple of requests for partials/fulls, I've also gotten many rejections. Some of them say the book is ""not right for their list"", which is completely understandable.  However, others have mentioned they love the premise but don't connect with the sample pages (I've typically sent them the first chapter). Although I know those are mostly form rejections, I'm still worried.

For context, English is my second language and also the second language of all of my beta readers. I'm not sure if there is something off putting in the first chapter that simple sounds very weird for native English speakers, and that is just flying over my head.

My second problem is just the first chapter in general. It's the bane of my existence. I love every other chapter in the manuscript except for this one, which is the most ""mundane"" of all (from the second chapter on, the Sci-Fi bits begin). It's the MC's call to adventure, but my gut tells me it is a little info-dumpy towards the middle. I've re-wrote this damn chapter maybe twelve times and I'm considering re-writing it before I send more queries.

Track your Biohacking Protocols & Supplements with the [Biohackr IOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/biohackr-health-optimization/id6745122843)


Ever feel like your brain is running a marathon, but you're stuck on the couch? You know that gnawing feeling when deadlines loom, your to-do list stretches for miles, and your phone just won't stop buzzing? We've all been there - caught in the relentless grip of stress. It's not just a feeling; it's a very real physiological response, one that can hijack your focus, steal your sleep, and generally make life feel a lot less enjoyable.

Now, when you hear ""biohacking,"" you might think of advanced tech or complicated supplements. And yes, some biohacks do get pretty sophisticated. But here's the thing: true biohacking is about understanding your body and mind, then making intentional choices to optimize your performance and well-being. And what's more fundamental to well-being than managing your stress response? This post isn't about eliminating stress - that's probably impossible - but about **hacking your reaction to it**, so you can tap into inner calm and razor-sharp focus, even when life gets hectic.

## Understanding Your Stress Superpower (and Its Downside)

Your stress response is actually a pretty incredible survival mechanism. Think about our ancestors facing a saber-toothed tiger - their bodies flooded with adrenaline and cortisol, sharpening senses, boosting strength, and preparing them to either fight or flee. That's your ""fight or flight"" system, the sympathetic nervous system, kicking in.

The problem? Most of us aren't outrunning tigers anymore. Instead, our ""tigers"" are traffic jams, overflowing inboxes, and social media pressures. And our bodies react the same way, staying in a prolonged state of high alert. This chronic activation can lead to burnout, anxiety, poor sleep, and a general feeling of being overwhelmed. It's like having your foot on the gas pedal all the time.

The good news is you have another system - your ""rest and digest"" or parasympathetic nervous system - that acts like the brakes. Mindful biohacking is all about consciously engaging those brakes, shifting from constant reactivity to intentional response.

## Mindful Biohacks for Taming the Tiger

Ready to take back control? These aren't complicated, expensive tricks. They're simple, powerful practices you can integrate into your daily life to downregulate your stress response and cultivate calm.

### 1. Breathwork: Your Instant Calm Button

This is probably the most underrated biohack out there. Your breath is directly linked to your nervous system. Deep, slow breathing signals safety to your brain, activating the vagus nerve - a superhighway for parasympathetic activity.

* **Box Breathing:** I've found this one incredibly effective. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat for 5-10 minutes. You'll be amazed how quickly it shifts your state.
* **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** Focus on breathing into your belly, not just your chest. Place a hand on your stomach and feel it rise. This deep breathing encourages full oxygen exchange and calms your system.

### 2. Mindful Movement: Move Your Stress Away

You don't need to hit the gym for an hour. Even short bursts of mindful movement can work wonders. Physical activity helps metabolize stress hormones and signals to your body that it's safe to relax.

* **Walking Meditation:** Step outside, leave your phone behind (if you can!), and just walk. Pay attention to your feet hitting the ground, the sounds around you, the feeling of the air. It's a moving meditation.
* **Gentle Stretching or Yoga:** A few minutes of stretching can release physical tension, which often holds emotional stress. Think cat-cow stretches or a simple child's pose.

### 3. Cold Exposure (The Quick Reset)

Now, this one might sound a little intense, but bear with me. Brief, controlled exposure to cold water can be a powerful way to train your stress response. It's a controlled stressor that, when overcome, helps build resilience.

* **Cold Shower Finish:** After your warm shower, switch to cold for 30-60 seconds. Focus on deep breathing. You're teaching your body to stay calm in a stressful situation. It's actually pretty invigorating once you get used to it!

### 4. Digital Detoxes: Reclaim Your Attention

Our screens are constant sources of information, notifications, and often, low-grade stress. Giving your brain a break from the digital onslaught can significantly reduce mental clutter and reactivity.

* **""No Phone"" Zones:** Designate areas in your home (like the bedroom or dining table) where phones are off-limits.
* **Scheduled Breaks:** Try an hour or two each day where you intentionally put your phone away and engage with something else - a book, nature, a conversation.

### 5. Gratitude and Reframing: Shift Your Perspective

Your mindset plays a huge role in how you perceive and react to stress. Cultivating gratitude isn't just a feel-good exercise; it actively shifts your brain's focus from threat to appreciation.

* **Gratitude Journaling:** Every morning or evening, jot down 3-5 things you're genuinely grateful for. Even small things - a good cup of coffee, sunshine, a comfortable chair.
* **Reframing Challenges:** When faced with a stressful situation, ask yourself: ""What can I learn from this?"" or ""How can this challenge help me grow?"" It doesn't negate the difficulty, but it changes your relationship to it.

## Your Journey to Inner Calm

Mindful biohacking isn't about perfection; it's about progress. You don't need to do all of these every day. Start small. Pick one or two techniques that resonate with you and commit to them for a week. Notice how you feel. I've found that consistency, even in small doses, is far more impactful than sporadic grand gestures.

Remember, you have the power to influence your internal state. By intentionally engaging these simple, yet profound, biohacks, you're not just reacting to life - you're actively shaping your experience, finding your inner calm, and sharpening your focus, no matter what the world throws your way.

1lcy5rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1lcy5rv/real_question_does_lying_continue_even_after_a/,Real question: Does lying continue even after a spouse leaves? Is the MFMC to blame?,"I’ve seen several posts concerning lying to spouses after one has left the church. If not lying directly, then lying by omission. Deceit. Deflecting. Whatever you want to call it.  

And I’m struggling with this concept because it mirrors the MFMC’s own pattern. The MFMC lied, hid, deflected, then ultimately gaslit their entire membership, all in the name of “love.” They wanted to keep us for very selfish reasons that directly benefitted the organization they set up, so they purposefully buried information, withheld informed consent, and made our decisions for us. Their outcome was the “right” outcome, therefore they were willing to do whatever it took to get all parties there, consequences of hurt and betrayal in the event they were exposed be damned. 

Porn and masturbation. Finances. Sabbath day observance. WOW choices. Becoming PIMO without saying a word. The MFMC lied, set up the formula, and now couples are doing this, too? Hiding because they’re worried their partners (especially if those partners are still TBM) can’t/won’t handle the information in a way they (the withholding party) want? 

Please don’t mistake me—these situations are terrifying and rightly so. Families have been lost over a spouse’s faith; reputations have been vilified over the use of porn; the occasional cup of coffee has led to custody battles and visitation rights. But at the end of the day . . . isn’t it a spouse’s right to know? Or, at the very least, isn’t it their right to *have* the option be given, to make that decision for themselves? To either know in totality, or to make the choice to have that information withheld from them, knowing it’s always available if they change their mind.

When I think of the church’s inner dialogue regarding those who’ve left, this is often how I imagine it:

“I’ve known about this [14-year-old wives, BoA mistruth, Ensign Peak investment fraud] for a really long time and you know what? I’ve had the time and space to confront it and I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s really not a big deal. I don’t know why you’re upset, even though you’re literally hearing about this for the very first time, ever. God, this is why I didn’t tell you. I knew you’d act like this. You’re really going to throw EVERYTHING away, just because of a little bit of hiding? Is it really worth it? To do that to yourself? Can’t you see these were the RIGHT choices? You didn’t need to know! I did this FOR you. I made your choices FOR you so you could be HAPPY, goddammit!”

Is it so different for marriages to do the same? To hide porn use from a spouse who’s never been exposed to healthy sexual teachings and then berate them for a lack of immediate acceptance and understanding of a (honestly, pretty historically recent) societal norm because THEY weren’t the ones guilted and shamed and taught to hide it all in the first place? To fudge the numbers on whether or not tithing is being paid when one party isn’t participatory in the workforce and thus doesn’t always see the flow of expenses? To stash coffee cups in outdoor trash bins and under car seats and bury them beneath a mound of paper towels and cardboard boxes, all in the name of keeping the peace? 

To those who HAVE tried to offer up information only to have been immediately shut down—fuck the MFMC for everything they ever set up to contribute to spouses who refuse to acknowledge anything contrary to their faith. You tried. So many of you are STILL trying. You want to be heard, you want to be seen, and you want to be understood. You want an honest, open, communicative relationship with the one person you love more than anything else in this world. And you deserve that. You deserve fucking all of that. 

In the end, the best I can come up with is this: Hurt people hurt people. We’re hurting. Our spouses are hurting. Sometimes it’s our fault, sometimes it’s not, and often the ideal of reaching a compromise that works for both parties seems as much a fantasy as the MFMC being true. So, you know, fuck them [the MFMC] again. Fuck them for lying, fuck them for teaching us to lie, and fuck them for all they’ve created and all the families they’ve destroyed.

Denon 570 and classic series. I had the unit do the auto set up and everything needed for set up. 
Here's the issues I'm having. 

1. If the dialogue is low and on purpose like character talking to themselves or whispers to each other is so low I can't hear it. Then the action is loud. Kinda frustrating. 

2. The volume changes are way to small of changes. 0 to 100 with a .5 change. 30 is fine for alone listening and 50 is great for movies but having to push volume up 40 times is a lot (yes I know I can hold it). I don't need this much fine tuning. Any way to change this?

3. If I change from tv to my Xbox oh boy get ready. The volume difference is massive and always leads to spilled coffee. Any way to match these two? I will say this isn't new to my surround sound. The TV has always been louder than the console but now it's easily double.

I work for a company in Georgetown and stay there during the week. On weekends, I head to a friend’s place in Dallas. It’s about a two-hour drive. I usually leave on Friday afternoons and come back early Monday morning. Really early. I need to be on the road by 3 a.m. to make it in by 6:30.



The routine’s simple: coffee, maybe an energy drink, podcast or music to keep me alert. But today, none of it was working.



Every so often on these late drives, I get this feeling—like something’s behind me. Not a noise, not a movement. Just a presence. Something watching. I usually say a quick prayer and glance back just to settle my nerves.



Tonight felt different.



Forty-five minutes into the drive, my body already felt like it was shutting down. One energy drink was gone, and it hadn’t even touched the exhaustion setting in. My limbs were heavy. My eyes burned. I told myself I’d stop at the next gas station for coffee, but the road ahead was empty—no lights, no signs, nothing.



Eventually, I spotted one of those old roadside stations—weathered sign, flickering bulbs, the kind you wouldn’t stop at unless you had to. But I had to.



Inside, it was silent. Just the hum of aging lights and the faint whir of a cooler in the back. I grabbed a coffee and approached the counter. The man behind the register looked like he hadn’t slept in years.



“Long night?” he asked.



“No, early morning,” I replied.



He leaned forward slightly, voice low and strained. “Caffeine won’t help once he finds you.”



I stared at him, unsure if I misheard. “Who?”



“He waits for people like you. Exhausted. Alone. He encourages it. Wants you calm. Wants you to relax. That’s how he gets close.”



“What the hell are you talking about?”



“They say if you look into his eyes, that’s it. No one knows what happens after. The ones who talk about him… they never saw him directly.”



“So it’s just a story?”



He didn’t answer. Just handed me my change.



I left without another word. Back on the road, the coffee was weak, bitter, and didn’t help. I kept going, but the heaviness in my body only grew. The road blurred into monotony—lines, trees, darkness.



That’s when it came back. That feeling.



Not fear. Not quite. Just a slow, crawling certainty that I wasn’t alone. That something was behind me.



I didn’t turn around. I couldn’t. I adjusted the rearview mirror.



Two bright lights stared back.



They weren’t headlights. They were inside the truck. Twin circles of cold, steady light—watching.



And then, movement. A hand. Thin, long, impossibly dark—reaching toward me from the backseat.



I froze. Muscles locked. The only sound was my own breathing.



Then a voice spoke—low, calm, familiar.



“Hey,” it said. “You’re tired. Let me drive.”



It was Jacob’s voice. My friend. But he wasn’t here.



“What… what are you?” I asked.



“It’s me. You need rest. I’ve got the wheel.”



No. This wasn’t real. This was something else.



Then another voice joined in. Softer. Familiar in a different way.



“You’re okay,” it said. “Just close your eyes. I’ll take care of you.”



“Samantha?”



My girlfriend. Studying abroad. Thousands of miles away.



“Yeah. It’s me. I don’t want you to crash. Just close your eyes.”



Fingers touched my shoulders. Gentle at first. Cold. They began to massage my neck. A slow rhythm. Meant to lull me deeper.



I couldn’t stop it. My body ignored every warning. My eyelids grew heavier with every blink. The road disappeared into a haze.



Maybe just a few seconds, I thought. Just to rest.



I closed my eyes.



And it felt warm. Quiet. Like slipping beneath the surface of still water.



But then something pulled at the edge of my awareness again. A wrongness I couldn’t name.



I opened my eyes.



It was daylight.



The dashboard read 4:23 AM.



The light outside didn’t match anything I’d ever seen. Pale, golden, washed-out. No sunrise looks like that. The road stretched ahead, unchanged. The trees were still. Motionless. The shadows bent toward the light.



Something was wrong.



I couldn’t remember how long I’d been driving. Couldn’t remember the last turn I took. Couldn’t remember leaving the gas station.



The clock still read 4:23 AM.



I blinked.



4:23 AM.



I tried to listen for the engine. Nothing. No tires. No hum of the road. Just silence.



And that voice again, calm as ever:



“That’s better. Just let go.”



The mirror was glowing now. Not reflecting—glowing. A white, searing light that filled the cabin. The shape in the backseat wasn’t human anymore. It had no form. No edges. It was just there.



And I knew—this wasn’t a vehicle anymore. It was something else. Like I’d crossed into the mouth of something vast. Something waiting to finish what it started.



I whispered, “Am I dreaming?”



And from behind me, the voice said:



“No. You’re still drifting.”



The radio clicked on. Nothing but static. But beneath it, a whisper, clear as breath:

1lcy0jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1lcy0jt/exsd_came_back_during_a_vulnerable_time_and_now_i/,Ex-SD came back during a vulnerable time and now I feel financially trapped.,"I've been in and out of the bowl for almost 10 years. While I sacrificed traditional relationships, I had a good run. Some SDs helped put me through school and gave me experiences I never would’ve had otherwise. I had a turning point at the beginning of the year. I'm in my 30s now, and I realized sugaring no longer aligns with what I want: a serious, committed relationship with a real future. My libido and emotional needs have changed too. For the first time in a decade, sex to me is tied to emotional connection, and I can no longer offer myself up like I've been doing for a decade. I'm still in touch with some of my past SDs, a rare few who still gave me financial assistance even with intimacy off the table. I started looking for a vanilla job to transition out, but I’ve been struggling to break into my field and it's taking much longer than I anticipated. This is the most vulnerable I’ve felt in years. I’m unemployed, cash-poor, and my family can’t help.

During this low point, an ex-SD from 4 years ago reappeared at the most opportune moment. Maybe the universe was trying to tell me something, because the timing couldn't have been more peculiar. Our SR had been long, emotionally intense, and started feeling more like an affair (he’s married). I ended it years ago because it became too complicated and I wanted to move on. I never expected to hear from him again. But he tracked me down a number of months ago and instantly started love-bombing, saying he never got over me, I’m his soulmate, he didn't meet anyone else who compared to me, etc etc.

Since reconnecting, he’s been excessively generous. He gives me large 4-figure lump sums regularly, sometimes just “because.” He covers all of my bills, put me on multiple auto-pays with his credit cards, and even gave me my own high-limit credit card just for everyday spending. He surprises me with multi-thousand expensive gifts and practically gives me whatever I ask for, and more. I'm not into luxury goods, so his gifts are practical things like electronics, things I need around my house, equipment, etc. He’s basically taken full financial responsibility for me without blinking. I've seen other SBs complain about salt daddies or awful cheap exploitative man, and even two years ago, this setup would’ve felt like a dream and was what I thought I wanted all along. But now, it actually makes me feel sick.

Before I walked away the first time many years ago, it was very clearly understood what this arrangement was all about, and like every married SD, he was using a SB to help him stay married. It worked until it didn't. The worst part is that he **knows** I left sugaring to pursue a real future, and now he's promising divorce, commitment, a future. I never asked him for that, he volunteered it. It just feels **cruel**. Cruel because he’s dangling the fantasy of everything I want, knowing he’s still married, knowing this isn't sustainable for me.

Despite having a high-powered, demanding job, he somehow finds time to constantly text, call, and try to see me. I don't know *how* he finds time. It’s nonstop barrage. He wants to see me multiple times a week, even for small things like coffee, to go for a walk, or just to say hello. He was texting from morning to night and admitted he thinks about me **all day**, stalks my social media, re-reads old messages, and just want to be in ongoing contact. He tells me I’m his greatest regret and that no one compares to me, and he suffered greatly during the 4 years in between. The obsession is suffocating. My last failed vanilla relationship was in 2024 with someone who emotionally neglected me, so I think I was especially susceptible to this kind of intensity, as it was what I had wanted from my ex-partner. But now, I feel like I’m living in a golden cage.

Every time I try to pull away or create distance, he ramps up the money, gifts, and emotional pleas. I’ve encouraged him to start moving on and try to find someone else, so we can phase out of this, but he refuses and just latches on tighter. I’ve planned my exit multiple times, but I freeze when I think of the financial reality. I’m frugal and trying to save, but I’m scared of how long I can keep doing this.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do you break free from someone who gives you everything you thought you wanted *but* what you truly need? I used to have a way bigger backbone, but it's easy to have a backbone when you're financially affluent and have many other options like I used to, but this is no longer the case for me.

EDIT: In case it wasn't clear... I'm not poor, just cash-poor. I did build assets from my years in the bowl, but it is money I am not currently able to access, it's my cash flow that is doing very poorly right now.",2,1750092721.0,sugarlifestyleforum,5,0.67,False

1lcxzzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crowdfunding/comments/1lcxzzf/assisting_on_crowdfunding_techniques/,Assisting on crowdfunding techniques,"Hi Reddit,

I’m Tyler I’m a Utah local, lifelong dog dad, and founder of Willow & Co. Off-Leash Social Club, a dream I’m bringing to life right here in Salt Lake City.
  
Ideally, I’m looking for crowdfunding resources and techniques that would allow me to raise funds rapidly 


What is it?
It’s not just a dog park. It’s not just a bar.
It’s a 21+ indoor/outdoor space where:
	•	Dogs roam free, safely and happily
	•	Humans kick back with coffee by day or a craft drink by night
	•	Local artists, musicians, and makers find a home
	•	Community thrives one paw at a time

Think “dog park meets microbrewery meets co-working patio vibes.”

Why I’m here:
Building something this unique means funding is a beast and I’m tackling it one step at a time. I’ve officially registered the LLC, identified locations, and started working with local development teams. But now I’m asking for the community’s help to take this from blueprint to backyard.

Please find our Instagram @willowandco.SLC

Every dollar goes toward early costs: legal, permitting, design, and building a clean, safe, and enriching space for dogs and their humans.

If you’ve ever wished dog parks were less chaotic, patios were more dog-friendly, and social spaces were built with real community in mind… I hope this idea makes you smile. And if you’re able to share or chip in, thank you from the bottom of my heart (and paws).

Let’s build something a little wild and a whole lot of fun.

1lcxz1g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcxz1g,A (long overdue) Cheval Blanc Randheli Review & AMA,"**Where we went**: Cheval Blanc Randheli

**When we went**: Late February/early March 2025, which is considered the dry/peak season. We made our booking in July 2024 with the help of Alex (u/alex\_travels). Thank you for all of your help Alex!! There is a 150 USD F&B credit with Virtuoso bookings FYI. 

**Who went**: We’re an American couple in our early 30s with no children who are relatively new to the chubby/FATtravel scene. We’ve mostly stayed at Marriott properties in the past and our previous stays have included The Gritti Palace, The St. Regis Florence and New York, The Edition New York, The Royal Hawaiian, The Ritz Carlton Kapalua, and Mystique Santorini. Outside of Marriott hotels, we have stayed at the Castello di Casole (Belmond). Ultimately, we did not think our previous stays provided adequate comparison and considered our stay at the Cheval Blanc Randheli to be our first vacation in this category.

**Who this property is for & pros/cons:**

* Couples and families with children of all ages. Better for relaxing and lounging than doing tons of activities, though the staff is more than happy to make arrangements for you.
* We did 7 nights, but a 5-6 night stay might be the sweet spot. 
* Skip the overwater villa and spring for an island villa if you can.
* Pros: Incredible villas and spa.  
* Cons: House reef is not strong (not a place you can snorkel directly from your villa and expect to see a lot), and a fair amount of overhead seaplane traffic so not a place of true isolation and seclusion.

**Things to Note:**

* The island is in a different time zone, one hour ahead of Male. Apparently this is common but we had not been to the Maldives before and were a bit surprised by this.
* We had read posts about a dress code here, which somewhat deterred us. However, it did not appear like a dress code was actually enforced and we saw plenty of guests dressed very casually (e.g. T-shirt and shorts) in flip-flops or even barefoot at breakfast. Even at the fine dining restaurant, Le 1947, there was a guest in a polo, sneakers, and a bomber jacket. 
* I tested multiple weather apps including the standard iPhone weather app, Accuweather, [Windy.com](http://Windy.com), and Weather & Radar. While they were all somewhat helpful in giving a general sense of the weather, none of them provided enough accuracy for planning, i.e., there was at least some rain/wind on the days where it was predicted but the duration, intensity, and time of onset were not reliable even when adjusting for our specific atoll/region in the Maldives. On the bright side, the predictions tended to err on the side of worse weather so you are likely to be pleasantly surprised.

**Property Overview**:

* The Cheval Blanc Randheli opened in 2013 and is the second outpost of the luxury hotel brand of the LVMH family. 
* Located in the Noonu Atoll, it’s about a 45-minute seaplane ride north from the capital, Male
* There are 46 villas spread over three connecting islands (the first/main island is natural and the other two are man-made)
* In addition to these three main islands, there is a separate spa island, the private island with the owner’s villa, and a third island housing several tennis/padel courts and an outdoor gym  

**Pre-Arrival & Departure:**

* We were contacted by a hotel concierge (called Alchemists) several months before our reservation and were able to make dining and activity reservations in Nov/Dec (though probably not necessary to make a ton of reservations and we ended up changing many of our plans after arrival). 
* We arrived in Male the night before our reservation and were greeted in the arrivals terminal by representatives from both the JEN (our hotel for the night in Male) and from the Cheval Blanc, who confirmed the timing/logistics of our seaplane departure the next day. 
* If you need to stay in Male on arrival/departure, we would recommend the JEN Male (a Shangri-La property). There’s a complimentary shuttle to/from the airport and they coordinated well with the Cheval Blanc.  
* When we were dropped off at the seaplane terminal the next morning we were greeted by the same representative as well as the JEN hotel manager, who saw us off. We were ushered through the seaplane terminal, which is definitely a must as it was really hot and chaotic. The main airport terminal and seaplane terminal are on different parts of the island so we were transported by private car service to the Cheval Blanc lounge in the seaplane terminal. We were offered refreshments and all check-in was done in the lounge, which was really convenient. The lounge is nice and has quiet napping rooms, a kid’s play room, and showers. 
* We booked the shared Cheval Blanc seaplane (seats up to 8 guests), which is operated by Trans-Maldivian Airways, though we saw other guests arriving/departing by TMA. We were quoted 1,910 USD per person round trip, while the non-branded sea plane was 1,190 USD. The main advantage is that the CB seaplane offers a direct flight to the property, while the regular sea plane may make stops at other resorts on the way. There is also an option to charter a private seaplane.
* On the day of departure we were given of the use of the day villa #31 (two bedroom garden water villa) until 4:00 PM. Since we had a very late flight that night, after our arrival back in Male they very kindly let us use the seaplane lounge again until check-in for our flight opened. 
* We got CIP for departure since we had read horror stories about people passing out in line in the airport. Given how late our flight was it may not have been really necessary, but the main perk was getting a ride directly to where our plane was parked on the tarmac rather than taking the bus.

**Property**: 9

* The property is stunning, and our pictures don’t do it justice.
* We thought the islands were beautifully landscaped and maintained. If we hadn’t known that some of the islands were man-made, we would not have noticed. Some more observant guests might be able to discern differences (i.e. we’ve seen comments of the sand being a little rougher on the man-made islands). 
* The three main islands are accessible by walking/biking/buggy ride, and it is about a 20 minute walk from the furthest villa (#47) to the arrival jetty. We really enjoyed walking along the paths, particularly at night. There is adequate shade and protection from the sun, and you are only really exposed when walking on the bridges/boardwalks connecting the islands. There are phone boxes in case of emergency and umbrellas available on the way. Large puddles can form on the sand path after rain, but there are staff who work hard to fill in these puddles with sand. 
* The main communal buildings are on the first (natural) island, along with the island villas, which is the highest villa class. 
   * All of the main property restaurants are here (White Bar/Restaurant, Le Diptyque, Le 1947)--more on this below. 
   * There is a large pool next to the White Bar, which we never used. We did see a few couples/families using it but it never felt crowded. There are several cabanas lining the pool and there always seemed to be some available for walk-up use.
   * There is also the gym (actually two, one main gym with Technogym equipment and a spinning room, and Le Petit Gym with rowing equipment), watersports center, surf simulator, and kid’s club.
   * There is an open-air lobby staffed by concierge and a concept store with luxury-branded clothing, jewelry, accessories, shoes, and watches.  
   * Further out on the jetty there is Deelani, the dive center (which also sells various equipment), and a small air-conditioned waiting room.
   * There is also a medical clinic on this main island. 
* Beaches
   * The main beach surrounds the first island, with each island villa getting a section of the beach for their use. We were informed that we were free to walk along the beach so these are technically not entirely private to the island villas, but it seemed awkward to use those portions of the beach.
   * There is a section of the beach facing White Bar/Restaurant that is definitely communal and a great place for viewing the sunset.  
   * There is a smaller beach called Ranveli beach on the second island facing the lagoon. This is explicitly for communal use, and we were the only people we ever saw use it during our week-long stay. There were four cabanas stocked with plenty of towels and a nearby air-conditioned restroom/shower facility with ice-cold bottled water.
   * There is also a small beach on the spa island with several cabanas, so even if the main beach didn’t feel super accessible, between the Ranveli beach and the spa island it was very easy to get private beach time even if you didn’t stay in an island villa.
* Lagoon, Reef, and Wildlife
   * We loved the lagoon! It was a very comfortable swimming experience.
   * The main drawback of this property is the lack of a well established house reef. Nevertheless we enjoyed snorkeling off of the main islands as well as guided excursions to other nearby islands (more on this below). 
   * We snorkeled off the jetty near the dive shop, off of our villas, and on a small reef next to the spa island. 
      * Off the jetty we saw marine wildlife including a porcupine stingray, several nurse sharks, and even a spotted eagle ray.
      * There is limited marine wildlife directly off of the villas but you are still able to see various fish (e.g. parrot fish, moorish idols, and surgeonfish)
      * We were told that the spa island reef was the best on property, but the quality of the reef isn’t very good and paled in comparison to our excursion sites. Much of the reef appeared bleached, though we were still able to see trevally, triggerfish, and snappers in addition to what can be seen off the villas.
   * We wanted to give a shout-out to the other wildlife on the island. Though the house reef is not a strength, we found that there was still much to appreciate if you slowed down. We loved seeing the resident gray heron hunting and sunbathing along the beach in tow with a smaller striated heron. There were schools of small fish swimming in the lagoon with juvenile black-tipped reef sharks chasing them. One particularly magical moment was seeing the schools of fish leaping in the air while terns swooped among them. We enjoyed seeing the flying foxes/fruit bats fly around the palm trees and pool at night. And we even saw a green sea turtle swimming near our villa during one particularly high tide. 
* The resort seemed very family-friendly and we saw several families with infants/children of all ages while we were there. The kid’s club was recently renovated and has been praised by other families. Though we cannot speak personally to the experience for kids/families, everyone seemed to be having a good time.
* One note:
   * Aside from the house reef, the other main drawback of the property is that there can be some overhead traffic from arriving/departing/passing seaplanes. There are a good number of properties in the Noonu Atoll, including nearby Soneva Jani and Siyam World, which is the largest resort in the Maldives. I was awoken one morning by a sea plane flying overhead at 7:40 AM, and there would regularly be air traffic by 8 AM going until 4-5 PM.  

**Rooms**: 9.5

* The villas are amazing and a highlight of this property.
* We stayed in two different villas, villa 45 (overwater villa) and villa 19 (garden water villa). While we did not receive an upgrade, our two complimentary nights (as part of our Stay 7/Pay 5 rate) were taken from the higher category room. We were also able to check into our garden water villa one night early. 
* The villas are large (around 2,300 square feet). The rooms flow from one to the other with rotating panels separating them and the high ceilings give the interior an expansive feel. The layout of each villa is more or less the same, with the main difference between categories being the amount and layout of outdoor space.
* Though these villas are now over 10 years old, they have been well-maintained. We did notice small signs of wear and tear (e.g. staining and rusting on the blinds) that didn’t detract from the overall experience. In our first villa there was one tray that was lopsided and broken, and housekeeping must have noticed this because as part of their routine it would be moved to various locations around the bedroom, but it was never fixed or replaced.
* Bedding was comfortable and the beds were quite large. When the bed felt harder after moving to our second villa, housekeeping was able to add an extra mattress topper to make it feel more comfortable.
* There is an iPad in each villa that controls the blinds, lights, and AC, and this functioned quite well, though there were occasional delays in the blinds opening/closing. The AC was very powerful, and you were able to set the temperature in each of the main rooms. Note that the blinds do not offer a perfect blackout experience due to gaps between the panels (the main flaw of the villa imo).
* Each villa comes with a large 40-foot pool, which we preferred to swim in rather than the main communal pool.
* The welcome gift/amenity included a complimentary bottle of champagne and pastries/chocolates. Each evening with turndown new sweet treats were set out. 
* Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks in the minibar are included in the room charge. We loved the paprika potato chips and the bottled mango juice. These were replenished daily. Plenty of complimentary water was provided in the room.
* There was a kitchenette with a microwave, a full-sized fridge, and a coffee maker which we did not use much.
* A few notes:
   * We wanted to stay in an overwater villa as part of our first trip to the Maldives, but would likely not stay in this room category again. During high tides the waves would splash up against the villa stilts and create a booming sound, and during our windiest night the villa shook with each wave. Though logically we knew that the villa was safe, this was still discomforting and made it hard to fall asleep.
   * All villas have a view of the surrounding water. If you are particular about your view, you might prefer a lagoon villa as non-lagoon villas will have views of the sea wall. We were told that villas 30 and 32 have the best views of the water/sunset and that villa 47 has the best chance of seeing dolphins. 
   * There is a bright light emanating from the thermostat in the bedroom that we did not notice in our first villa as it had been covered but was left uncovered in our new villa. We used post-it notes to cover it during our first night and housekeeping subsequently covered it when servicing the room.
   * We overall saw very few bugs, though after moving to the garden water villa we did see two dead cockroaches in the bathroom one morning. You will encounter more bugs as well as lizards in the island/garden villas rather than the OWV. 
   * Our villas felt private, though we could see that certain locations would definitely offer more privacy than others. The island villas probably offer the most privacy, particularly villa numbers 8-16 as they are on the opposite side of the main island facing away from the arrival jetty.
   * Upon checking every crevice to ensure we packed all our belongings on check-out, I noticed some pistachios under the couch from a previous guest. I understand this is very nitpicky but thought it was notable given how flawless the rest of the experience was.

**Food**: 8

* Food was overall varied and good quality, particularly considering the location. For the 7 nights we were there we never got tired of the food. In general the Maldivian/Indian food was the best, though we also enjoyed the Italian cuisine as well.
* Breakfast is included in the room rate and is served at The White Restaurant from 7 to 11 AM. We were told that no matter how late we slept in we could order breakfast anytime, though we did not take advantage of this. We were generally there between 8 to 9 AM and at that time there were only a handful of other guests there. We enjoyed sitting outside, though there is also the option to sit in an air conditioned room. 
   * There is a small buffet of fruit, cereal, yogurt/milk, breads, and pastries that is supplemented by a large a la carte menu of various Western/Maldivian/other Asian options. You can order as much as you want. 
   * The menu was extensive and incorporated multiple cuisines. Our personal favorites were the daily rotating pastry, hazelnut iced chocolate, avocado toast (the star being the sourdough bread it was served on), dosa, and dim sum. Upon asking for chili oil, I was offered two varieties and on subsequent meals it was provided to me without me having to ask for it. 
   * I had been looking forward to the fruits and freshly squeezed juices but was rather disappointed by this (a lot of it was tart). It’s understandable given that most everything has to be imported. I had the most mouth-puckering orange juice ever. Another small thing was that the hollandaise sauce was quite congealed when it was served so I wouldn't recommend the eggs benedict.
   * We were presented with a traditional Maldivian breakfast on our last morning after we had already ordered our food. This ended up being quite a lot of food, so keep this in mind when planning your last breakfast. 
* White Bar/Restaurant for lunch/dinner
   * Our go-to restaurant with a large, diverse menu. Overall the food is executed well. Our personal favorites were the Maldivian chicken curry, deep-fried summer rolls with duck, club sandwich and fries, and the ice cream and sorbets. The roasted banana sorbet was SO GOOD.
   * On several nights of the week there are special themed dinners:
      * Indian Ocean Night is currently on Thursday night and features a set menu of small bites/appetizers, a selection of curries, and rice and bread service. There was also some live music and local singing/dancing. It was fun trying different curries and we would really recommend this.
      * Santorini Night is on Saturday night and similarly features a set menu of Greek-inspired food. We found the execution/quality of this to be not as good, and the portion sizes were disproportionately large for a tasting menu, and we found it difficult to finish the food. Would not recommend this, or if you are really interested consider splitting one order of the tasting menu. 
* Other specialty restaurants:
   * Le Diptyque
      * Features a Japanese restaurant plus teppanyaki bar which requires its own reservation. We had seen really good reviews of this but were let down. The rolls were okay. The best dish was the Chilean seabass. The miso black cod, which we have had at other restaurants, was quite sweet. The sakura gyoza dessert was very bitter and bad enough that we ended up sending it back (very unlike us). We had booked dinner at the teppanyaki bar a few nights later but were so disappointed with our meal here that we ended up canceling this.  
   * Deelani
      * Italian restaurant and one of our favorite restaurants on property. The bread service included some of the best focaccia we’ve ever had. We loved our arancini, pasta, and risotto, though it was pretty salty (and we love salty foods). Had one of my favorite panna cottas here. 
      * Side note: DO NOT eat at this restaurant during lunchtime. It is located on the jetty and is directly in the line of fire of arriving/departing seaplanes. The noise/wind/gasoline smells were really strong during this time.  
   * Le 1947
      * The property’s fine dining restaurant, featuring a tasting menu of French fine dining and named after Chateau Cheval Blanc’s legendary vintage (two bottles are currently in their possession). It has a sister location at the Cheval Blanc Courchevel, which has earned three Michelin stars. 
      * We are somewhat familiar with French fine dining, having eaten at Alléno at Pavillon Ledoyen, Guy Savoy in Paris, and Le Bernardin. Accordingly, while we were very excited for this meal, we did not find that it met those same standards. However, being that we were in the middle of the Indian Ocean, the food was still quite good. Some standouts were the fideuà and wagyu tenderloin. Unfortunately, we found some of the other dishes to be a bit disappointing and ended up being split on our opinion of the restaurant. We accordingly recommend tempering expectations.
      * The acoustics were not great and at one point when the dining room was full, it got to be quite loud, which was not the vibe we were looking for.
   * The Spa Bar
      * A surprise hit. We ordered spring rolls, a cold soba noodle salad, and panna cotta after our spa treatment and enjoyed it a lot. They also serve an amazing complimentary hot/iced ginger tea. 

**Service**: 8.5

* Service was attentive from beginning to end. It felt high-touch without being overbearing. We felt very looked after. 
* Our impression was that the staff was majority Maldivian with other staff coming from India/Bangladesh, Southeast Asia, and France/other European nationalities. We were touched by the pride the staff had in the property and the Maldives overall, as we hadn’t come across this in other destinations/properties we stayed in previously. The locals in particular were very proud of their Maldivian heritage and happy to share their culture (from the etymology of menu items to sharing a local chili condiment when mentioning our love of spicy food). Everyone was professional, friendly, helpful, and extremely hard-working.  
* All communication is done with your villa butler (“majordome”) via WhatsApp. Our butler was very responsive and typically replied within minutes. The butler is responsible for 3-4 villas at a time, but we felt that we were well attended to.
* Buggy service is prompt and it was easy to arrange for pick-up. If our butler was not personally available, another butler would come to pick us up. 
* Boat service to/from the spa island and tennis island was also prompt and easy to request.
* Your butler coordinates with housekeeping to ensure that service/turn-down is done while you are out of the villa during breakfast/morning activities and dinner in the evening. There was one instance where our morning plans changed and we returned to our villa still being serviced, but otherwise this was coordinated seamlessly. 
* The staff knew us/our villa number, so there was no constant asking for our room number.
* The GM, Laurent, was very visible and made daily rounds speaking to all of the guests. (He was also coincidentally on our seaplane for the ride back to Male and gave us a very warm farewell lol)
* FYI that a 10% service charge was automatically included with most meals and excursions and there was no line on our bill for tips (we chose to tip in cash intermittently and as an added charge to our bill upon check-out).
* We never ordered room service so can’t speak to that.
* A few notes:
   * Samy, the White Bar/Restaurant manager, was the standout. He was so personable and welcoming. 
   * There were a few times at breakfast where food items we had ordered were forgotten and we had to ask for them again.
   * A note on why we rated service a bit lower: It pains us a bit to be rating this a little bit lower because it felt like everyone we met was working hard and trying to provide a great experience. However, we have been at other properties where the service felt a little bit warmer or more personal. There are times where service goes above and beyond what you expect to the point where you are a little bit touched (i.e. personalized notes/gifts based on an excursion you may have had that day or remembering that we liked a certain snack and leaving extra in our room). We did not experience that here though we saw some nice gestures for other guests (i.e. a guest commenting that they liked the hazelnut spread and being gifted a can to take home). So while the service was definitely top notch, we felt like it didn’t hit those highs that we have experienced in the past.  

**Extras & activities**: 8.5

* While the resort is probably best suited for people who love to lounge and beach, there are still plenty of activities to engage you. We aren’t really people who can hang out by the pool with a book. A few times from day 5 onward one of us felt a bit bored every now and then, though we were able to figure out things to do every day.  
* We are type-A people (surprise surprise) who planned our itinerary months prior to arrival, though in retrospect this was probably not necessary for most activities. Through our butler it was very easy to cancel, rearrange, and make new plans within minutes. 
* Watersports/snorkeling/diving
   * Our water-based adventures were easily the highlight of our trip
   * Dive shop crew was very friendly and approachable
   * Snorkel gear was easily available from the dive shop, and they have prescription snorkels available though these had to be kept at the dive centre. The snorkel gear was ScubaPro and we really enjoyed using them. This was complimentary with the room rate.
   * I believe that at least some of the water sports center equipment, like kayaks and SUP, is included in the room rate, though we did not take advantage of this. We did see someone use a wind foil so there are definitely some fun toys.
   * We did not personally try this but we saw people having fun on the surf simulator, which is available at an additional charge.
   * We arranged for a private snorkel charter. We were taken about 20 minutes away to a reef drop-off at Kuredu Island Resort. This was our favorite snorkeling so far (our other point of reference is Maui). It was like snorkeling in an aquarium and we saw multiple green sea turtles, white-tipped reef sharks, a cowtail stingray, and huge schools of fish.  
   * While we don’t dive, there is the option to get certified and charter diving expeditions through the dive shop.
* Scheduled group activities (also available for booking as a private excursion):
   * Traditional Sunset Fishing: Two-hour excursion where you are taken to multiple nearby spots. No fishing experience required as staff help you set up and teach you the basics. You have the option of having the fish you caught prepared and cooked for you for the next day which we really enjoyed. 
   * Snorkel Splash: 90-minute excursion where we were taken 5-10 minutes away to a reef drop-off at Raafushi. We enjoyed this spot, though it was not as good as Kuredu. What was really nice about this was that though there was an advertised 4-person minimum for all group activities, they still took the two of us out without canceling the excursion.
   * Sunset Dolphin Cruise: This was one of our favorites. It was straight out of a movie where spinner dolphins were leaping and jumping around the bow of the boat. It was truly magical. There was some friendly competition between boats from Soneva Jani and Siyam World sightseeing in the same area, though each boat was able to get good glimpses of the dolphins.  
* Spa Island
   * In comparison to other spas we’ve been to, there aren’t any communal spa facilities here (we and the staff were both confused when we asked for a tour of the spa facilities). Rather, there are several private spa villas with a steam room, sauna, and cold plunge pool. Each villa has multiple lockers/dressing areas, which suggests it may have been planned as a communal space previously, but it is currently entirely private. We recommend reserving this with your butler in advance, but the amazing thing is that this is included with your room rate. 
   * We booked a couples massage. One of us really enjoyed it, the other thought it was fine. The massage room was quite nice and it would have been nice to linger more.
   * There is a nice infinity pool here with the aforementioned Spa Bar. 
   * We didn’t use this but there is a yoga pavilion here too.
* Tennis
   * The island this is located on is about a 10 to 15 minute boat ride away. There is a hardcourt, an artificial grass court, and padel courts. Tennis rackets and balls are part of the reservation. We didn’t realize until afterward that they actually have a large variety of rackets, so if you don’t like the racket that is set out for you you can go to the nearby clubhouse and switch it out for a different one. 
   * There is a tennis pro you can set up lessons/clinics with if you want. 
   * The vibe on this island was kind of weird tbh. We had read somewhere that there were trails you could explore and were expecting some freedom to just wander around, but we were escorted around the whole time we weren’t playing.

1lcxyr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1lcxyr7/preeclampsia_without_high_bp_or_other_symptoms/,Preeclampsia without high BP or other symptoms?,"36w today. Has anyone been diagnosed without high BP, swelling, right rib pain, etc?  I’ve had the worst headache for the past day that tylenol hasn’t helped so I called the nurse on call line yesterday because that’s what my OB has always said to do. They sent me to L&D but I was quickly sent home because I didn’t have high BP. They didn’t test protein levels in my urine or do bloodwork while I was there, and when I asked why not they said I didn’t have enough symptoms for them to be concerned about preeclampsia. I was told to rest and take extra strength tylenol instead, and surprise! It didn’t work. 

I called the nurse line again this morning and was told to have a cup of coffee and take excedrin, then if that doesn’t work to go back to L&D. So far no relief. I’ve had a few headaches this pregnancy but they’ve always went away within an hour or so after taking tylenol. ",1,1750092611.0,BabyBumps,0,1.0,False
1lcxykz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1lcxykz/i_feel_like_such_as_an_asshole_and_resentment/,I feel like such as an asshole and resentment toward my Grandmother in Law. And she is the nicest person around with hardly any symptoms,"My wife and I's journey began into this back in March of this year. To make the summary really short, she had what appeared to be a panic attack. She wanted to go into the hospital. Ended up having extremely bad hospital delirium and her potassium was low. She hasn't been diagnosed with dementia. But according to my wife's aunt, this doctor on the floor told her he was absolutely sure she had dementia and can not live on her own. The doctor also said other stuff that was crazy. Grandma's doctor pretty much said that doctor at the hospital was clueless.   
  
 And just to add my wife's aunt is extremely toxic. She yells at grandma for not having her hearing aids on and make it sound like grandma can't do anything. For the longest time, she wanted to put grandma into a home. But I know for sure that even if grandma sells her house and what's left, we may have 4-5 years of money for the avg price of assisted living. So she pushes us to move into Grandma's house. And for context our house is 10 minutes away and her aunt lives around the corner. Oh and the aunt has come over here probably 2 times since we moved in her back in March.

After the delirium, Grandma appears to be doing pretty well. She is pretty independent like she was prior to us moving in. No ADL help. But we take care of her meds and I pay the bills. I always told grandma that I would do anything to prevent her from being in a home and to look after her. Especially after her toxic daughter tries to push her in a home. I think she has an ulterior motive of putting grandma in a home so that she feels she can be done and move out of state to be around her kids and grandkids. 

I only been here for 3 months, but I feel like my world is flipped upside down as we are away from our home. And I miss our home even though I see it once a week. It's a home that I paid off and spent a lot of money on. I miss my home office. Right now I'm 42 and grandma is 85. I'm pretty confident she will at least make it to 90. And even make it to 100. If she makes it to 100, I will be 57. It depresses me. Like I said Grandma is very independent. But it's the little small things that just make me so angry. First example is I like to make coffee in the kitchen. But Grandma gets behind me and gets in my way. She is trying to make dinner early in the morning getting it all prepared. And I can't make my coffee. I end up storming out of the house and going somewhere to get it.  And there are little things like she tries to help with laundry. But somehow she lost a pair of pants I had and my wife's pajama bottoms.

I totally get it. This is extremely minor stuff. I hear all of your stories on here and mine is absolutely nothing compared to this. But now I'm just so angry with not feeling I have a home. And then the wife's aunt is in the way. She is handling all the phone calls for per physical therapy. And then she calls my wife to put it on the calendar. She constantly controls things. And it gets to my wife and I. In December of 2024, we written a letter and gave my wife's aunt a key. We were clear in that we no longer want to communicate with her again unless it has something to do with Grandma. There was an incident over Christmas to where she ruined a gift I worked so hard for grandma.  And those three months felt so liberating.

We just feel dumped into the situation and honestly I do wonder if Grandma has dementia. She always had age related memory issues according to her primary doctor. And I heard the doctor was going to see if he could diagnose her for dementia as she would be in a primary setting. But he never diagnosed it. Grandma is supposed to go to a neurologist when we are away on vacation. But I feel like I need to see the report as I caught my wife's aunt from lying before. And she will be with the neurologist. And Grandma has an appointment with the doctor in September.

I'm sorry for rambling, but I just feel angry towards so many people. And I feel 100% selfish over it. I'm angry that her aunt doesn't take care of grandma. She claims it's because of her ""health issues"". And if we say ""fuck it"" and leave, then I'm confident my wife's aunt will put her in a home. And it shocks me too as the aunt is only interested in Grandma's money. There will be no money if we sell her home and use her investments for assisted living.  And I really do believe grandma can be independent. I been analyzing [alarm.com](http://alarm.com) wellness solution. I can have bed sensors, chair sensors, a pendant that can detect falls. Plus an amazon echo device to drop in. Plus I feel like we can drop by her house twice a day for AM and PM meds (plus dinner after work) And I think we can link up to her Freestyle Libre to get the alerts. But try to tell the wife's aunt that and she would just be a bitch about it.

I'm just now at the point I am just so angry at Grandma and like I said she is the nicest person. After work, I stick around in my home office after dinner and read in my lounge chair until she goes to bed. And I'm up before she gets up. I just feel like I don't want to see her and I feel trapped. I feel like my only way out of this is either grandma passes away on her own or her aunt passes away.

I’m a 22-year-old guy based in London, looking to build real, long-term friendships — the kind that ideally involves meeting up in person eventually. I find it hard to build genuine bonds without shared experiences beyond a screen.

If you're just messaging out of boredom or tend to ghost after a day, feel free to skip — I’m here for meaningful connections, not quick chats.

Who I’m hoping to connect with:

Aged 18–25 (ideally, but I’m open to slightly older if you’re genuinely looking for friendship)

Based in the UK (even better if you’re in London or nearby)

Open to eventually meeting in person — for coffee, gigs, or just to hang out


A bit about me:

⚽ Football fan — I play weekly

🤘 Big into rock & metal — always up for gigs (would be great to have people to go with!)

🎮 Gamer — mostly into single-player games across genres

🎬 Into Marvel and all things nerdy

🏎️ Love go-karting and theme parks (always looking for fellow thrill seekers)

🧠 Neurodivergent — emotionally aware, open-minded, and a good listener

What I’m not looking for:

One-word replies

Inconsistent or low-effort conversations

Surface-level chats with no real intention of building something


What I am looking for:

People who want real connection and are willing to put in effort

Comfortable with regular chatting, gaming, or voice calls

Open to meeting up or hanging out down the line


If you message me, please include your age, gender, location, and a bit about yourself so I know you’ve actually read this and are serious about connecting.

Wanted to share my notes from Rhonda's new episode all about the the longevity benefits of coffee. She really brought the heat with this one. Highly recommend. Timestamps linked below. Here it is in full: [https://youtu.be/vgrV9rjqQyA](https://youtu.be/vgrV9rjqQyA)

Turns out, coffee is actually VERY good for you. But a few caveats related to how you brew it and when you consume it. My notes:

1. Each daily cup of coffee consumed correlates with a **reduction in your epigenetic age by 0.7 to 1 full year**, with three cups reducing accelerated aging risk **by nearly 40%.** So pretty darn good for longevity. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=84s))
2. Drinking dark roast coffee daily correlates with a reduction in **severe DNA double-strand breaks by 23%** (the same genetic damage caused by radiation), significantly reducing cancer risk. I think a pretty common misconception is that coffee increase cancer risk. Not the case. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=84s))
3. **Drinking unfiltered coffee like French press or espresso raises LDL cholesterol by up to 30 mg/dL within weeks.** Filtered brewing methods (including paper-drip, instant, or cold brew) remove this risk. Probably the most IMPORTANT part of the episode. Man... I had no idea. Espresso too. Something about these molecules called diterpenes that don't get filtered out. They raise LDL-C. I think another way to think about this.... there's just no reason your morning coffee should be raising your LDL-C. I think she mentions she uses instant coffee ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=961s))
4. Drinking three or more cups of caffeinated coffee daily **reduces Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s risk by 34–37%**. So when it comes to the brain... caffeinated is superior to decaf, by FAR. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=1720s))
5. Drinking **2–4 cups of coffee daily boosts gut production of short-chain fatty acids**. Ok... so here's why that's important. This tightens the gut barrier, reducing inflammation. Also enhances insulin sensitivity. So turns out coffee is actually amazing for your gut. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=819s))
6. **Adding dairy to coffee reduces immediate antioxidant absorption by 20–30%.** This significantly blunts coffee’s rapid cognitive benefits. Best to drink it black if you want the brain boost. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2526s))
7. Combining **100–200 mg L-theanine with coffee significantly enhances sustained attention, improves accuracy, and speeds reaction times** through increased GABA and glycine signaling. I think most people know l-theanine calms the caffeine's jitters, but I did NOT know how it kind of amplifies coffee's cognitive benefits. Good stuff. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2719s))
8. Drinking 2-3 cups of coffee daily **reduces diabetes risk by up to 60%** through AMPK activation. So coffee is elite for metabolic health. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=481s))
9. Each daily cup of coffee you drink is associated with **roughly a 15 to 20% reduction in liver cancer risk, and about a 10% lower risk of endometrial cancer**, with maximum benefits seen around 4-5 cups per day. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=1240s))
10. **95% of coffee samples globally contain mold toxins far below safety limits**—and roasting beans further reduces levels by 70–90%. Oh man... this one is for you Dave Asprey. Guy made a living on freaking people out about mold in coffee. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2363s))

I've had my coffee. Mostly. Still a little over half full, this cup. And then also there's this from the sidebar:

> This subreddit explores spiritual awakening: the path to awakening, awakening itself, **and living from the awakened reality**.

Everybody who is woke is ""living from the awakened reality"" in their own way. Not everybody eats pizza with a knife and fork. Something like that. 

All these disclaimers up front. Why? I'll get to that at the end of the post, if I remember.

*clears throat.*

For years I was...well actually, let's start back when I was a toddler, practicing tai chi with my oldest brother in the basement of Grandmom's house. There I am, three or four, and he says something something, ""Mind over matter.""

And it stuck. Always resting at the back of my head, a curiosity to wield the **powah of mind over mattah!** *a flashbang, sparks and smoke.*

Fast forward to late twenties and I'm swimming in a months-long afterglow from acid. Declared myself a wizard, because, through the lens of acid, it's an adventure. Anything is possible.

Neville Goddard got dropped in there at one point. Somebody gave me the book *The Power of Awareness* before walking away. That night, read the thing cover to cover. So drank in all of that content, distilled: **It's all Consciousness. If you can imagine it, and more important, feel it as Reality, then it becomes so.** Sometimes. More on this later, if I remember.

So fast forward again and I stumble across the Gallery of Magick. Some outfit with a series of books all about *practical magick*. 

I play with it. And it works. Ho-lee-sit. 

My thrust for whatever reason is less about material goodies and more about internal whatever. I've seen things manifest, all by themselves, or with little effort or desire.

So **things aren't as important as States** of Consciousness. There was somebody who said that if you can change a state at will, this is more valuable than manifesting a car or a love of your life (for a few months until you get bored with them or discover something new about yourself and get over the idea of needing anybody to fulfill an imaginary need...).

That said, I used magick primarily for shadow work. The Gallery of Magick (GOM) has this book, *72 Sigils of Power* which is excellent for shadow work. It allows you to target specific personal hiccups and transmute the thing.

**Emotional Alchemy.**

In fact, I'd wager almost all of GOM's material is emotional alchemy, or **changing one State of Consciousness into another.**

(so not necessarily temporary, surface emotions like, idk, grumpy because i haven't had coffee.)

Then once a change in Consciousness occurs, because it's all Consciousness, Reality (or experience) reflects the change.

You literally live in a different state. Like California versus Alabama. 

Wealth is a State, for instance. But there are layers (cities?) to that. There's overall wealth, but then wealth in relationships, as an example. What would that feel like? *72 Sigils of Power* targets these little layers.

So line by line all these tense areas are exposed and transmuted (shadow work). And through this one becomes **more conscious of the way of things** relative to your unique view of it all.

Alright. What do Angels have to do with this? This is the fun part.

It's all Consciousness. Bet. Solid idea. Let's relate it to the body. There's one body. Bet. That body has a head, a left arm, right foot, left pinky and toenail. One body, many parts. 

Angels are different parts of Consciousness. Gabriel, as an example, is known for Intuition. Whether or not an actual being named Gabe exists is irrelevant. It represents intuition. Intuition is an aspect of Consciousness. 

So when I work with Gabriel, I am working with my intuition. Developing a relationship with Gabriel is developing an awareness of my intuition. Back to the body: lifting weights.

One body, many parts, and one part is the left bicep. The more I work it with hammer curls, stronger it becomes. 

Magick is like spiritual weightlifting. lol. so stupid.

*clears throat.*

Magick allows me to become aware of and engage all these different aspects of Myself, Consciousness. Which is all there is.

Alright, phew. What a sloppy mess of ideas. Any meat in all that? Now what was I supposed to remember? Oh yeah.

**When That wakes up beyond the idea of some personal self, or any idea of any thing at all, it does what it does absent the tension to take anything serious.**

My coffee is cold now. Son of a. 

Oh, and then the other thing about it (magick, or manifestation a la Neville Goddard) not working all the time. That which is beyond ideas doing everything. And sometimes what you think is wanted isn't wanted by That.

So there we have themes of surrender, let go, or, my favorite: don't take it serious.

In fact the less serious one is about any of it, the more it works. Almost like attachment is the root of suffering. huehue.

I just got back into the routine of going to the gym consistently after a few years of a mix of being ill, and having too much anxiety to start back up. Safe to say the consistency is back on, slowly but surely. This follows with a lot of re learning my body and how it reacts and responds to physical activity. I have the early phases of dizziness, excessive weakness and other symptoms that are sorta normal when starting back up. I decided to try creatine for the first time and the first day wasn’t so bad! I took about 2.5g, felt super great, pumped, definitely pushed myself. Took the other 2.5g at the end of my workout, felt fine, peed a LOT! The following workout day (1 gap day in between) I took the full 5g, and immediately felt off. I had a tightness in my throat area, chest bloating, felt like I couldn’t breathe properly (I could, I just felt like I was gasping for air even though I wasn’t…) and I noticed I was extremely disassociated and anxious. I had to cut my workout super short because I didn’t know what it was. Finished my workout at home, I got super dizzy and confused but again, I didn’t know what it was but started to think it was the creatine. I got a concussion that same night, was out of the gym for 4 days (this past week), I went again yesterday after said 4 days and being fully recovered, took 5g of creatine again just to see what would happen. I felt good for the first 15 mins at the gym, peed a LOT! Then, it started again. Onset dizziness, felt like I couldn’t breathe (this was almost immediate again), gasping for air, but this time I felt like I could hold more air in my lungs than normal, if that makes sense. I could breathe deeper but it made me dizzy to do so. I had extreme anxiety throughout the rest of the day to the point where I had an anxiety attack at night. Woke up this morning and felt fine. I’ve kinda declared it’s the creatine, skipped coffee this morning just to be sure and I haven’t had any of the symptoms I’ve been having. I’m either thinking, stick to 2.5g, or try to keep going as normal without supplements. 

Has anyone else had odd side effects? I’ve read up on some people having similar side effects and it definitely affects everyone differently, but the confusion and gasping for air has been pretty consistent with it. I also just feel extremely disassociated on it, I plan on consulting my doctor when I see them in August about it. ",0,1750091417.0,Supplements,6,0.5,False

This is a memory from, god, 9 years ago, but it's been stuck in my head like a catchy song this past week 🙃

It was just before Christmas. I had already relapsed in my mind. I just hadn’t done it yet. I was in Philly, standing on the edge of one of the most notorious neighborhoods in the country: Kensington.

If you’ve never been there, don’t bother Googling. Just picture open-air drug deals, people nodding out like slow-motion ghosts, and the kind of silence that feels like it’s watching you.

I didn’t know the exact block.
So I just… asked.
Like a tourist looking for a goddamn Starbucks.

“Hey, uh, do you know where I can get dope?”

People gave me directions like I was asking for the nearest Wendy’s.

“Yeah, just go two blocks down, hang a right after the guy with the shopping cart full of scrap, and you’ll see a dude with a neck tattoo and a pitbull. He got you.”

I was about to follow one of those breadcrumb trails when I saw an older Black man sitting at a busted bus stop bench, nursing a coffee.
He looked like someone’s uncle. Not threatening. Just tired.

I walked up to him, sheepish but desperate. “Do you know where I can get some dope?”

He looked me up and down (white girl, skinny, pale, twitchy) and said,
“Sweetheart… you do not wanna go down there.”

Then, after a pause, with the kind of tired kindness that belongs to people who’ve seen it all:
“Drop me off at my house. I’ll make a call. Get you what you need.”

And somehow, I said yes.

We got in my car. He directed me like we were heading to brunch. We pulled up to this small, crumbling row home with a tiny porch and a dented screen door.

Inside, it was quiet. Smelled like old furniture and strong coffee.
He offered me a cup, like a goddamn host.
Then he made a call like he was ordering Chinese.

While we waited, i pet his dog.
Big, dopey mutt. Wagged its tail like I was a long-lost friend, not a girl one bad choice away from oblivion.

We sat there for a while.
Talked about nothing.
Sipped coffee.
Waited for the guy to bring the dope.

And when it came, he handed it to me like it was a favor. Like I was someone worth being gentle with, even if i was also burning my life down.

I got the bun.
Said thank you.
Left.

He didn’t ask for money.
He didn’t try anything.
He didn’t moralize.

He just gave me coffee, made a call, and let me pet his dog before I ruined myself for a little while.


And for some reason… I never forgot him.

Not because he saved me.
But because he didn’t treat me like trash.
He didn’t try to fix me or exploit me.
He just saw me. in the most mundane, weirdly sacred way.

And sometimes?
That’s what gets you through the next few days.
Not a rehab. Not a lecture.
Just a man at a bus stop who said,
“You don’t wanna go down there. Come with me instead.”",2,1750091403.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.76,False
1lcxfrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1lcxfrn/my_afib_hacks/,My aFib Hacks,"I’ve been dealing with aFib for IDK almost 8 years now, diagnosed initially as PACs, later as aFib. I would have episodes sometimes frequently, sometimes not for a week or so at a time lasting from a few minutes to many hours. I was prescribed Flecainide and Metoprolol but not very stoked about getting on the daily medication train quite yet, especially when my doctor was not interested in figuring out WHY this was happening. I’m 60 now, have no other health problems and am very fit, exercise and lift weights, BP and labs are all good, don’t drink or smoke, don’t eat much sugar, and am mostly vegetarian. However, I do have moderate sleep apnea. After many experiments with this or that, taking supplements, eating or not eating this or that, I’ve finally been aFib free and off the meds for about 6 months (I gradually tapered off to see what would happen, but admittedly wasn't the best at taking them regularly anyway). I just want to share what seems to be working for me, for what it’s worth. I started taking a CoQ10 supplement (a good quality one), along with magnesium and zinc. I also turn off the WiFi at night and unplug my wireless printer (I found that if I woke up in the middle of the night with aFib I had invariably forgotten to unplug the printer, believe it or not). Coffee doesn’t affect me, but a big gluten bomb might trigger it (not always, though), andmaybe dark chocolate, sadly. I also started TRT about 4 months ago but I’m not sure if this has had an effect either way. I feel like maybe the CoQ10 has had the biggest impact. I read about an alternate Flecainide use where instead of a daily pill you can take a larger dose when needed which I'm going to ask my doctor about this just to have something in my back pocket in case the monster returns. I recently ordered a Circular Ring that can detect aFib just to keep tabs on it (it hasn’t arrived yet), but fingers crossed that whatever I’m doing now continues to work. Keep up the fight, aFib warriors!

I don’t have a steady schedule of waking/sleeping. I usually wake and take my medication and then get right in breakfast so my meds don’t kick in and make me not hungry before I eat. Then I have coffee after breakfast. At night I often snack a bit late. 

Iron is meant to be taken away from caffeine and on an empty stomach, and with vitamin c if possible (which I’ve been advised to avoid with my adhd medication). 

It feels hard to make a habit because I would have to take it mid day in between eating and I am working from home right now varried hours so this “in between” is at different times each day. In response to the complications I haven’t taken it for months :(

I’m Tyler I’m an Utah local, lifelong dog dad, and founder of Willow & Co. Off-Leash Social Club, a dream I’m bringing to life right here in Salt Lake City.

What is it?
It’s not just a dog park. It’s not just a bar.
It’s a 21+ indoor/outdoor space where:
	•	Dogs roam free, safely and happily
	•	Humans kick back with coffee by day or a craft drink by night
	•	Local artists, musicians, and makers find a home
	•	Community thrives—one paw at a time

Think “dog park meets microbrewery meets co-working patio vibes.” 

Why I’m here:
Building something this unique means funding is a beast and I’m tackling it one step at a time. I’ve officially registered the LLC, identified locations, and started working with local development teams. But now I’m asking for the community’s help to take this from blueprint to backyard.

Please check out our Instagram @willowandco.SLC

Every dollar goes toward early costs: legal, permitting, design, and building a clean, safe, and enriching space for dogs and their humans.

If you’ve ever wished dog parks were less chaotic, patios were more dog-friendly, and social spaces were built with real community in mind… I hope this idea makes you smile. And if you’re able to share or chip in, thank you from the bottom of my heart (and paws).

Let’s build something a little wild and a whole lot of fun.

Hang in there, it’s a very LONG read.","I'm (30F) supposed to be going to a concert with my friend I haven't seen in over 6 years (28F). The concert is next week and my husband (30M) just blew up last night saying that he's very uncomfortable with me going. 
Long Backstory: ever since having our first child, he has been more controlling over where I go, how long I'm out and how often I'm communicating with him. Like if I don't text him that I'm going to target after I went to a coffee shop he thinks that I'm not communicating and his excuse is that he just worries about me if something could happen he just wants to know where I am. I have had this conversation with him more than I'd like to admit, and it has caused me to not make plans, not go out of state or travel without him. Constantly asking me when I'll be home and how much longer will I be etc. 
I don't go anywhere. Let me just say that. I'm a stay at home mom, living across the country from my whole family and all of my friends. I don't have friends here except maybe one or two acquaintances that I rarely ever see. So I'm in my house all day long cleaning, cooking, doing online college full time, scheduling my kids appointments, sports practices and games, taking care of our animals, making sure bills are paid and our finances are right. 
The only ""alone"" time I have by myself is going to the grocery store or maybe going to the thrift store for an hour. Other than that, he's always making comments when I say I'm going to the store. ""This isn't one of your going to the store but stopping at 5 other places kind of trip is it?😅"" and that immediately gets me irritated because I never go anywhere. Legit. No where.
I've been on a couple of trips to California where we are from and everytime I go there without him, there's always some type of issue.
Ex: if I say I'm meeting my friends for lunch at a restaurant at 1 PM but we end up meeting at 11:30 PM to walk around a bit before lunch, and I casually tell him ""hey, just got here! We are walking around a bit before lunch visiting shops and what not!"" He automatically says, ""you never mentioned going to walk around before hand? I'm just finding this out? A little communication would've been nice. If I don't know where you are and something happens blah blah blah."" or if I say I'm going to be back at my parents house (I stay here when I go back to cali) around 5 while I'm hanging out with friends and I get home at 6:30, He gets so irritated saying that I never get home when I say I will be and I don't let him know that I'm running behind and I'm just not telling him things because it's not on my priority list..."" This has been an ongoing issue for years now and we always end up having a huge fight and then it's all good until the next time it happens.
I tell him that most times I'm caught up in hanging out and catching up with my friends/family and texting him every hour isn't on the top of my list of priorities. He just doesn't seem to understand that.
Anyways, back to the original post😅
I had talked to him about going to this concert after she had mentioned it to me about four months ago and how I really wanted to go and he said that would be fun! Flash forward two months when presale tickets were available, I had saved up money from my job to pay for a ticket. She had been able to get tickets for pre-sale before me so she just bought me mine and I paid her for it. My husband knew the concert was in another state and my girlfriend lives 2 1/2 hours from where the concert is. So he knew that we had to drive a long ways to get to the concert from her house. Assuming he knew that, which clearly was my fault that I assumed so he says, we obviously had to get a hotel room for the night because the concert ended super late and we didn't want to drive back at 1am. So I had mentioned to him that we were looking to get a hotel and he said oh OK. He also was on the phone with someone so I'm not sure if he remembers responding to me after telling him that. My friend also has two young kids and doesn't get to hang out with people or do fun things as well, so we were saying that we should probably drive up the evening before so we didn't have to rush the morning of the concert and we could maybe walk downtown at the huge farmers market. I mentioned to him that I needed to save up a little bit more money to pay for the hotel for those two nights and for necessities or whatever while I'm down there. He then responds,""You never told me you were staying at a hotel for two nights."" so I had to have another long conversation/argument with him about the same thing we normally fight about. I basically told him that I'm just sick of him trying to be so controlling over the things I do. He constantly reminds me that he does trust me, but he doesn't trust the people around me and it worries him. That's his argument every time. Well, we settled that with him basically saying that he won't bring it up and that he's fine with it. 
The real issue was last night. He had asked if her husband was going to the concert as well, and I said I think so. She had told me that he wanted to go because his friend would be at the concert. He said are they sitting with you? And I said I don't know, but she had told me she got tickets in the same section. So obviously I didn't know if it was next to us or 10 rows in front of us. He got quiet and said you never told me that her husband was going with a friend. I don't know this friend and neither do you.
I got confused as to why he was getting irritated... so I said you look uncomfortable?
He then said, ""yes, you're right I'm very effing uncomfortable. We don't know these people anymore, we haven't seen them in over six years so I don't really know what goes on with them and their friends. You didn't tell me this because you were trying to keep it from me. You knew it would make me uncomfortable."" he also said that he won't be texting me at all while I'm over there only to check in every now and again. He said that if he text me while I was over there that it would just drive him crazy...which is weird. So I woke up this morning and I was thinking about just canceling my trip as a whole. Telling my friend that she can sell my ticket and I can get a partial refund on my flight and we didn't pay for the hotel yet, so that's not an issue. I don't know if I should do that or just keep my plans the way they are. I just know that he will be pissed off the entire time that I'm gone & possibly turn it into another situation when I get back. I honestly just wanna avoid all of that unnecessary stress and tension, because it will just ruin my whole trip. Am I wrong for being irritated or just feeling defeated? I don't know what to do, and my trip is literally 10 days away. ",2,1750091181.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

New year, new me.

That’s what I keep telling myself as I stand before the mirror, trying to believe the girl staring back is someone worth becoming. It’s barely 6 a.m.—the sky outside still bruised with morning darkness—but I’m already dressed for the first day of school, the soft cotton of my baby-pink T-shirt hugging my frame, paired with classic denim shorts that show off the golden tan I worked for under the summer sun. The color—once too cheerful for the shadow I’d been living in—feels bold today, like a flag raised high. A quiet rebellion. I haven’t worn anything this light in over a year. But this year... I’m reclaiming pieces of myself. My hair, long and dark blonde, is pulled into neat French braids I practiced on countless boring evenings this past summer. Boring because, well, what else is it when you spend every day working and not a single person calls you up to hang out? A swipe of highlighter on my cheekbones, a coat of mascara, and a soft gloss on my lips—just enough to feel like I tried. I strike a few poses in the mirror, throwing myself a smirk. Let’s be real—I look damn good. With a burst of confidence, I swing my backpack over my shoulder and jog downstairs. The scent of bacon leads me into the kitchen, where Dad and Callum are already at the table. Dad’s nose is buried in the newspaper, a mug of coffee cradled in his hand. We share the same sandy blonde hair and green eyes, almost like copy and paste. Callum, my little brother, is a balanced mix of both our parents, his hair darker, more chestnut, but those same eyes—sharp and knowing. Good morning, honey,"" Mom sings from behind the stove. ""Morning, Momma,"" I reply, sliding onto a stool at the kitchen island.

She places a plate of bacon and eggs in front of me, and I flash her a grin. There’s something comforting in her small kindnesses—the way she hums while cooking, the messy bun that always sits slightly off-center, her pajama pants still wrinkled from sleep. She doesn’t work; Dad’s job as a project engineer covers everything. Still, she works harder than any of us keeping this house and all of us inside it running.

""Excited for your first day back?"" she asks, her brown eyes shining.

I swallow hard. If only she knew.

She doesn’t, of course. All she knows is that Jace and I broke up. That’s the version I gave her when she noticed the dark cloud hanging over me last year. She didn’t push. Just said she’d be there if I ever needed to talk. I wanted to—God, I wanted to—but shame has a way of sealing your mouth shut.

""Yeah,"" I say. ""I’ve got all AP classes this year. Time to start on college applications.""

Mom sighs playfully and rolls her eyes. ""Always the overachiever. Just like your father.""

""Not a bad thing,"" Dad mumbles behind the paper.

Mom’s the kind of woman who thinks kids should make memories by breaking a few rules—sneaking out, partying, the typical rebellion arc. Me? Even before everything imploded, that was never my thing. I enjoyed being with friends, sure, but I was focused—ambition kept me tethered. I’ve always dreamed of studying marine biology. It matters to me—maybe too much.

Thankfully, I don’t have to worry about paying for college. My parents can cover tuition, which is a blessing, but I still need to get accepted. And I’d like to stay nearby. As much as the past year broke me, this is still home. My family is still home.

I turn to Callum. ""Shouldn’t we be asking if Callum’s excited?""

He groans and shoots me a look. ""Second year. Nothing new.""

""But this is your year—varsity football,"" I say with mock enthusiasm. ""You’ve been training all summer.""

His mouth curves into a cocky grin. ""I’m going to be the best player out there.""

I narrow my eyes. ""Cocky little thing.""

He chuckles, shaking his head, and then the blare of a car horn cuts through our banter. Callum grabs his bag and bolts to his feet.

""That’s my ride. See ya!""

Dad looks up just long enough to call out, ""Why not take your sister too?""

""You coming, Bel?"" Callum asks, though we both know the answer.

He’s always offered. And while he doesn’t care what people say about me, his friends do. I get it. Still, he’s the only one at school who hasn’t treated me like a disease. He’s fought for me—literally. I don’t think I would’ve survived last year without him.

""Nah, I’ll walk. I like the fresh air,"" I say with a smile.

He nods. ""See you at lunch?""

""Of course.""

Once he’s gone, I finish my breakfast, ignoring the knot in my stomach. I try to help Mom clean up, but she shoos me away. I kiss Dad’s head, hug Mom tightly, and step outside, earbuds in and playlist ready. I scroll until I find something upbeat—something that doesn’t remind me of anything at all.

There’s a little spring in my step.

This year’s going to be different. I’m going to be different. Maybe—just maybe—everyone’s forgotten what happened.

Right?

I should probably back up and tell you what ""what happened"" actually was.

It might not sound catastrophic, but it wrecked me. It felt like everything I knew about my life shattered in a single breath.

Violet had been my best friend since we could walk. We were inseparable—sisters in everything but blood. As we got older, our worlds pulled in different directions, but we always made time. Her cheerleading, my studying—we made it work. Her new friends didn’t like me, but Violet never cared.

Or so I thought.

It started with a party she begged me to attend at the start of sophomore year. I’d never been to one. She dressed me up, did my makeup. I remember feeling... beautiful. New.

She ditched me the moment we arrived.

While she disappeared with her latest hookup, I ended up outside with a plastic cup of water I pretended was vodka. That’s when I met Jace.

He had the same fed-up look as me—trying to escape the noise. We talked. We laughed. And just like that, we were a couple.

Jace picked me up every morning in that sleek car of his. He held my hand in the hallway, took me to his games, made me feel like I mattered. I thought I’d found my fairytale.

Then junior year started, and everything crashed.

We went to another party. I didn’t even want to go, but Jace insisted. That night, I let him have my virginity. I thought I was ready. I thought it meant something.

He dumped me right after.

I was still lying in bed, naked, trying to catch my breath when he pulled his clothes back on and told me it was over. He said he got what he wanted.

I cried for days. Violet, at first, was there. She hugged me, brought snacks, played old movies. Then one morning, everything changed.

I walked into school and people were whispering, looking at me like I had grown horns.

At my locker, Violet waited—with backup. Three cheerleaders flanking her like guards. She made a scene, and I watched my world crumble.

She said she’d been sleeping with Jace for months. That I ""stole him"" from her first. That he tried to break up with me repeatedly but I begged him to stay.

All lies.

Then came the real dagger: she admitted our friendship had been a lie. That she pitied me. That I was her charity case. And when I ""stole"" Jace, she stayed close just to ruin me.

It shattered me.

Worse than the breakup. Worse than anything.

The school turned on me overnight. I was nobody before—quiet, average. But now, I was infamous.

People wrote ""slut"" and ""whore"" on my locker daily. Girls pushed me, threw things at me. Boys made crude jokes. Jace told everyone we’d had sex, and the rumors only multiplied.

That night ruined me.

By spring, I was draped in black hoodies, hiding from the world. You’d think people would move on, but some never did—especially Violet and her clique. They made sure I never forgot.

But that was last year.

This year will be different.

**Chapter 2 New Resolve**

It all felt so absurd, really. I hadn’t done anything wrong. But betrayal had a way of making even the most senseless things feel painfully sharp. The two people I trusted most—my boyfriend and my best friend—had turned on me like I was disposable. Jace and Violet. The ones who once swore they’d always have my back. Now they paraded their new relationship like a prize they’d won at my expense.

My family, at least, hadn’t abandoned me. That thought kept me tethered.

Still, this was my life now. Jace and Violet were a couple, and they flaunted it without shame. They made sure the world knew. Every hallway glance, every cafeteria kiss—it was deliberate. It was a show, and I was the forgotten audience.

The cafeteria had become a war zone. If I dared to show up, I’d be jeered at, pelted with food, or have my lunch stolen. So I started eating alone, beneath the branches of an old tree that offered no real protection, only distance. But even there, I wasn’t safe—not until Callum began sitting with me.

Everyone else kept their distance. I couldn’t fault them. Fear makes cowards of most, and high school was nothing if not survival of the most popular.

Callum figured things out on his own. We were two grades apart, but he wasn’t blind. After one especially awful day, he cornered me at home and demanded the truth. After that, he got into more fights than I could count.

It reached a point where I had to beg him to stop. I didn’t want him expelled over me. So, we struck a deal—he’d stop throwing punches, and I’d stop feeding him details. Eventually, the storm settled. By year’s end, things had calmed—well, enough.

This year would be different. I hadn’t heard from anyone all summer. Even working at the only movie theater in town hadn’t forced me into contact with them. The most I got was the occasional sneer or rolled eyes from old tormentors. I could handle that. Better a sneer than a slap.

Maybe they’d finally moved on.

I walked to school with a quiet kind of hope. Even as the grey building came into view, I felt oddly good. No one cared about last year anymore. Why would they?

They had to be over it by now.

With my schedule in hand, I slipped through the front doors and made a beeline for my locker—number 367. Conveniently placed near all my classes except one. Head down, I moved fast.

So far, so good. No one had noticed me. Just the way I wanted.

As I was unpacking my bag, two girls approached. I tensed, breath caught. Then one of them turned and opened the locker two spaces over. Relief washed through me.

They weren’t part of the inner circle that loathed me, but I remembered them. Especially the blonde—pretty sure she tripped me once.

""Did you hear?"" the blonde chirped.

""Hear what?"" her friend asked, inspecting her nails with disinterest.

""Jace and Violet broke up. For real this time. Not one of their fake breakups.""

Her friend scoffed. ""Sure they did.""

""No, I swear. Like a month into summer.""

Then her friend said it—the question that turned my blood cold.

""You think it’s because of that ex? The one who used to be friends with Violet?""

I froze.

The blonde laughed. ""Oh, please. That girl was pathetic for Jace. He’d never go back to her. She’s plain. And remember how she started dressing last year? Total goth.""

She shuddered, as if my old wardrobe choices had personally offended her.

""No, he’s moving on—to me,"" she said smugly.

Her friend snorted. ""Right. Like Jace Maddox would go for someone like you.""

Ouch. Besties, huh?

The blonde slammed her locker and glared. ""Jealousy’s not a good look, Haven.""

She stormed off. Unfortunately, Haven noticed me watching. Our eyes met. My face flushed as she scanned me from head to toe.

""Glad to see you’re not goth anymore,"" she said, smiling before turning away.

Weird, but... not hostile. That was a win. So far, only one person had even acknowledged me, and she wasn’t cruel. I could work with that.

Today was going to be normal. Just me, my books, and a whole lot of silence. College essays and AP classes waited.

I grabbed my supplies and made my way to AP English. The teacher was already there, scribbling something at his desk. I took a seat in the front row, farthest from the door. Ten minutes early. Just enough time to brainstorm essay topics.

As I jotted ideas into my notebook, the room filled. I silently hoped the AP classes would be free of the popular crowd. My hope shattered when Mireya walked in. Violet’s closest ally. Her eyes found mine. She didn’t speak—just glared, then took a seat in the opposite corner.

Fine. I could survive glares. It was the bullying I wouldn’t stomach.

I didn’t want to hide anymore. I didn’t want to be the girl with trash in her locker and bruises on her arms. I just wanted peace. It was strange how cruel girls my age could be.

After class, I lingered to ask Mr. Desmond if he’d review my essay draft when I finished. He agreed without hesitation. Not many students cared like I did. He seemed pleased to help.

AP Biology came next—my favorite. Mrs. Greer, a kind woman in her forties, lit up when she saw me.

""Good morning, Maddie. I’ve been looking forward to seeing you,"" she greeted warmly.

""Good morning, Mrs. Greer,"" I replied, returning her smile.

She’d taken me under her wing last year, when she learned I wanted to be a marine biologist. She’d guided me, mentored me, even promised to write my recommendation letter.

I claimed a front-row seat again and pulled out my notebook. While waiting for class to start, I drafted more notes.

When the bell rang, I looked up. The room was full—except my desk. Two seats to a table, but no one beside me. Mrs. Greer’s gaze lingered for a second, something like sympathy flickering before she turned away.

She never asked about what had happened to me. But I think she knew. Most teachers did. Still, she chose not to pry. Instead, she offered gentle encouragement and her time—things I clung to.

The class passed quickly. I didn’t want it to end. Mrs. Greer waved me off with a fond smile as I left.

AP Calculus came next—my most dreaded subject. I wasn’t bad at math, but I didn’t love it either. Still, I followed my pattern: front corner seat, notebook open, eyes down.

The rest of the day blurred. When the lunch bell rang, I found Callum waiting at my locker.

I beamed and ran to him. ""How’d you know this was mine?""

Callum gave me a look.

""Janitor’s coming to clean it off. Principal says it’ll be gone after lunch,"" he said quietly.

My stomach dropped. ""Move.""

""Just bring your stuff with you. I’ll carry it,"" he offered.

I stomped my foot. He was taller than me by a mile—unfair, considering I was the older sibling.

He crossed his arms, ready for a fight. Too bad, so was I.

Eventually, he sighed and stepped aside.

I gasped. White paint scrawled across the dark locker: Fat Pig.

Tears sprang to my eyes. First day. No one had even said anything. I blinked rapidly, willing them away. Then I opened the locker, shoved my books inside, and turned to my brother.

""Ready for lunch?"" I asked, walking away before he could answer.

""You sure? We could head to the library,"" Callum offered.

We used to do that—hide when things got bad. But not anymore.

""Nope. Not happening,"" I said.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him smile.

""New year, new you, huh?""

That’s right.

The rest of the day passed uneventfully. No comments, no stares. Maybe Callum had found the locker message before anyone else could.

My AP classes were smooth. Calculus remained shaky, but I wasn’t quitting. A full AP schedule looked good for college. I’d tough it out.

My second-to-last hour was an elective—a mentorship program for juniors and seniors. Last year, no one wanted my help. I spent the time studying alone. This year, I was determined to change that.

And it worked. I helped a group of freshmen navigate their science syllabus. They thanked me as the bell rang, and I assured them I was always around if they needed support.

My final period was a free hour—silent study. I chose the library and dove into my essay.

When the last bell rang, I stayed behind, working until nearly 4:30. The halls were empty by the time I returned to my locker.

The cruel message was gone.

I slipped my books away and pulled on my backpack. AirPods in, music on.

Today was a good day. A strong start.

Whatever they threw at me next—I’d be ready.

**Chapter 3 Worst Birthday Gift**

Two weeks had passed without major incident, just as I’d hoped. The only hiccup? A fresh insult scrawled across my locker this morning in bold black marker: ""Happy Birthday, Fat Whore.""

Yes—today was my birthday.

I barely blinked when I saw it. Rolling my eyes, I uncapped the white eraser marker I had tucked into my bag for just such an occasion and scrawled, ""Thanks a ton!"" right beneath it. I didn’t bother reporting it.

What would be the point?

Strangely, I was in good spirits. Words—cruel and ugly as they could be—didn’t hold the same weight anymore. Not when they came from strangers. The ones that cut deepest had come from the people I once loved. But I didn’t love them anymore, and that meant their power over me had waned. As for whoever was leaving these little valentines of venom? I had no idea.

Shouldering my backpack, I made my way to first period, slipping into my usual seat. Mr. Desmond, head bowed over a stack of papers, glanced up when I entered. One of the few teachers I respected. Kind. Steady. Fair.

""Good morning, Maddie. And happy birthday,"" he said, offering a soft smile.

""Thanks,"" I replied, my grin genuine.

""Teacher’s pet,"" someone muttered from across the room.

Of course. Mireya. And of course, she was early.

Mr. Desmond scowled, but I met his gaze with a calm smile. He moved on without comment, announcing he needed to fetch something from the lounge.

The moment the door shut behind him, Mireya abandoned her usual seat to slide in beside me.

""Heard it was your birthday today, whore,"" she chirped.

I said nothing.

""Or should I have said ’fat whore’?"" she added with a giggle.

I turned to look at her. Her platinum hair was scraped back into a ponytail that swung behind her like a blade. Blue eyes rimmed with perfect black wings. Already in her cheer uniform.

""Was that your handiwork on my locker this morning?"" I asked sweetly.

Her smirk faltered. She wasn’t used to me pushing back. Not like this.

""Lovely, huh? Being called fat isn’t exactly a compliment.""

I shrugged and returned to my notes.

""Not sure if you heard, but Jace and I are dating now,"" she said.

""Congratulations,"" I muttered without looking up.

""Just thought I’d mention it, you know, so there’s no tension.""

I snorted.

""Oh, there’s tension, all right,"" I said, lifting my eyes to hers. ""But it has nothing to do with Jace. Honestly, I hope you two are deliriously happy. It does make me wonder about your loyalty as a friend, though.""

Her face contorted into a sneer.

""What the hell does that mean?""

I tilted my head.

""I doubt Violet’s thrilled about your new romance,"" I said.

She rolled her eyes. ""And like you didn’t do the same thing.""

I hadn’t. But let her believe whatever made her sleep at night.

""And look how that turned out for me,"" I replied, watching as her complexion paled.

Mr. Desmond returned just then, saving her from further embarrassment. Mireya had to endure the rest of class from the seat beside me. She attempted to pass me notes throughout the hour, and I enjoyed dramatically tossing each one into the trash can in front of us.

I won’t pretend it wasn’t satisfying—because it was. Deeply. But I wasn’t interested in starting a war. I didn’t go looking for trouble. If she had left me alone, I wouldn’t have said a word.

When the bell rang and she tried to corner me, I breezed past her.

""Happy birthday, Maddie!"" Mrs. Greer called out as I stepped into the next classroom.

Two cheerful balloons bobbed over my seat, a small teddy bear nestled in my chair. My face lit up involuntarily.

""Thank you so much,"" I said, hugging the bear tightly and giving her a quick embrace.

""Want to pop the balloons before the others arrive?"" she asked.

I gave her a puzzled look. ""Why would I do that?""

She shrugged lightly. ""Teenagers can be cruel. I thought it might spare you some teasing.""

I offered her a flat stare.

""So, you saw my locker this morning?""

She nodded. ""I spoke with the janitor. Then the principal.""

I placed my book on the desk.

""And how did that go?""

She gave a dramatic huff. ""Does he even care? He barely listened.""

""Principal Maddox? Jace’s granddad? He never cared. I didn’t report anything last year either, so he just dismissed it. Callum calls him useless. I agree.""

""That still doesn’t make it okay,"" Mrs. Greer replied, her voice tight with frustration.

I glanced up. ""It doesn’t. But it made me stronger. And honestly? These gifts make me happy. Let them talk. It’s not their birthday.""

She seemed about to argue, but the classroom door creaked open as the first students trickled in.

""I’ll leave them up,"" I whispered.

She nodded and backed off. A few students muttered predictable comments about me being the teacher’s favorite. I let them roll off. Even a couple of ""happy birthday"" wishes floated my way. Polite. Casual.

Better than last year.

No illusions—I wasn’t expecting new friends. But at least the knives were sheathed.

By lunch, I’d practically forgotten the locker incident. Callum hadn’t. He was still fuming as we sat beneath my favorite tree, chewing our way through the usual cardboard-flavored pizza.

""Can you stop sulking already?"" I groaned. ""It was my locker. I should be more upset than you.""

""Doesn’t it bother you even a little? It’s not even true. Yeah, you slept with that asshole and got betrayed by your best friend. Isn’t that punishment enough? Can’t they just leave you alone?""

I blinked at him. ""Were you trying to bring it all up again?""

""Sorry,"" he muttered. ""But doesn’t it piss you off?""

I took a bite of my greasy pizza.

""I think I skipped over mad. I cried too much last year. I’m done crying. This year, I want peace. Even if they keep being dicks, I’m going to ignore it. I want a good senior year. Or as close as I can get.""

Callum shook his head, a reluctant smile tugging at his lips. ""I envy that. The way you don’t care.""

I grinned. ""So, how’s football? Big night tonight.""

""Yeah. First varsity game,"" he said, nerves threading through his voice.

I gave his leg a quick pat. ""You’ll kill it. You’re too good not to.""

He straightened, flashing a cocky grin. ""Damn right. I’m hella good.""

I laughed. ""Exactly.""

His smirk faded. ""There’s a new guy. Just joined. He starts Monday. A senior. Apparently, he’s amazing. Might cost me playtime.""

I frowned. ""Didn’t know we had any new students.""

""Barely arrived. But yeah, he’s kind of insane on the field.""

""You’ll still get your shot.""

""Hope so. You coming tonight?""

""Do you want me there?""

He scratched the back of his neck, suddenly shy. ""Mom and Dad are coming. It’d mean a lot if you came too. But no pressure.""

Jace would be there. Mireya. Violet. All of them.

""Oh, I’m coming,"" I said. ""No more hiding.""

The rest of the day didn’t go quite as smoothly. I walked into AP History and nearly did a double take. Jace. I don’t think he’d been in this class before. Or maybe I’d just never noticed. I didn’t exactly scan the room for him.

He sat next to me. I ignored him.

""Happy birthday, Maddie Bear,"" he said.

My muscles locked.

""Fuck off, Jace,"" I muttered, eyes fixed on my notebook.

""Is that how you treat someone who got you a present?""

A present?

I glanced at him warily.

""It’s a bracelet. I got it as an apology,"" he said, almost hopeful.

""Oh, Jace,"" I said sweetly. His face brightened. ""You can take that apology and shove it up your ass.""

His smile faded.

""Come on, Bel. What do I have to do for you to forgive me?""

I stared at him.

Forgive? He hadn’t even said he was sorry.

""You know what, Jace? I forgive you,"" I said, turning back to my page.

He exhaled in relief. ""Great! So, I’ll pick you up after the game tonight?""

""Mhmm.""

Wait. What?

""No,"" I said quickly. ""Just because I forgave you doesn’t mean I’m going out with you.""

""Why not? We were great together. You were always my good luck charm.""

I gagged, audibly.

He scowled.

""Don’t be a bitch, Maddie. I’m trying to be nice.""

I looked up, eyebrows raised.

""You know who might appreciate that effort? Literally anyone else. Like, I don’t know—Mireya. I hear you two are dating.""

I turned back to my notebook. The bell rang. The teacher walked in.

I didn’t wait around.

Let Jace call after me.

What a fucking jerk.

**Chapter 4 Birthday Scars**

Relief swept through me the second I stepped into my next class, the door closing behind me like a barrier between myself and everything unraveling outside.

Jace fucking Cooper. Unbelievable. The nerve of that asshole—like I’d ever crawl back to him after what he did. And people used to say I was the one out of touch with reality.

Midway through class, as I bent over a worksheet to help a nervous freshman boy navigate his algebra, the intercom crackled to life overhead.

""Would Miss Madison Harrison please report to the principal’s office. Thank you.""

The teacher glanced up and gave me a subtle nod. I murmured an apology to the boy, gathered my things, and slipped out of the classroom.

At the front office, Mrs. Olivia greeted me with a smile so tight it could cut glass.

She was everything you’d expect from someone who got off on wielding minor authority: rail-thin, always dressed like she was auditioning for some sexy noir film. Today’s ensemble? A navy blouse stretched over her chest, tucked into a black pencil skirt that clung to her hips like a second skin. Lips painted a venomous red, her graying hair scraped back into a severe bun. Honestly, someone should investigate her. Rumors weren’t just rumors in this place.

""Miss Harrison,"" she said, her tone oozing disdain, like I’d tracked mud onto her pristine marble floors. ""Principal Maddox will see you now.""

Even though he’d obviously summoned me, I knocked before entering. His gruff ""Come in"" didn’t make the tension in my gut ease.

Maddox was stationed behind his desk like some bored, overfed troll. Arms folded across his rounded belly, light brown eyes—the same shade as Jace’s, unfortunately—fixed on me from beneath a shiny bald dome and wisps of white hair. But it wasn’t him who rattled me.

It was Violet. Slumped in the chair across from him, tears streaking her cheeks, mascara bleeding down in twin rivers of black. Her bottom lip trembled as she shot me a bitter look.

Okay, what the hell is this?

""Miss Harrison,"" Maddox said with that practiced gravitas. ""Take a seat.""

I sat carefully beside Violet, lowering my backpack to the floor, eyes darting between them.

""Can someone tell me what this is about?""

""Miss Erickson has come forward with claims that you’ve been harassing her.""

My eyes went wide.

""Excuse me?"" I laughed, the sound sharp. ""Are you serious?""

Maddox’s gaze hardened. ""Is this amusing to you, Miss Harrison?""

""No, sir. I’m just... confused. You’re telling me I’m here because I’ve been bullying her?""

Violet turned to me, her voice laced with venom. ""Don’t act clueless. You’ve been cruel to me for weeks—since before the year even started. Just because Jace and I are together.""

Wow. So Jace is juggling her and Mireya while also trying to ""make amends"" with me? That’s rich.

""We have a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, Miss Harrison,"" Maddox said, voice stiff with self-righteousness.

Violet gave a dramatic sigh, like a tragic actress in some daytime soap. ""We used to be best friends, Maddie. I know I hurt you, but Jace and I love each other. You need to move on so we can make up.""

Yeah, sure. Jace loves you, and every other warm body he can get his hands on. Does she really not know what her ""best friend"" Mireya’s been doing?

""Well?"" Maddox barked. ""What do you have to say for yourself?""

I arched a brow.

""Honestly, I’m baffled. I haven’t done anything to Violet. And I think deep down, you know that, sir.""

I’d been anticipating something like this. Once the locker bullshit stopped getting a reaction out of me, it was only a matter of time before they tried a new tactic.

""Excuse me?""

""No disrespect intended, sir,"" I said smoothly. ""But I’ve got receipts. Witnesses too. Plenty of photos of the crap they’ve scrawled all over my locker.""

I didn’t. But I said it like I did.

""All of which you’ve ignored. My brother’s brought it up to you more than once, and every time, you brushed it aside. So maybe it’s time my dad’s legal connections take a closer look. I’m sure they’d be interested in how you’ve handled student safety.""

Maddox’s face turned beet red, his silence loud. Violet stared at me, slack-jawed. I wasn’t the kind of girl who pushed back. But there’s a limit to how long you let yourself be trampled.

""Are you threatening me?""

""Not at all. Just pointing out what might happen.""

I sighed. ""I’m not here to stir up trouble. I just want to finish senior year in peace. Focus on my classes, nothing more.""

He cleared his throat and gave a stiff nod.

""Very well. You’re dismissed, Miss Harrison.""

I stood, slinging my backpack over one shoulder.

""You’re just going to let her go?"" Violet shrieked.

Oh, someone’s plans just backfired.

""You’re dismissed too, Miss Erickson.""

""But—""

""I said go.""

Mrs. Olivia didn’t say a word as I passed, and I didn’t spare her a glance. It always stunned me how some adults could treat teenagers with less dignity than they’d give a stray dog. If my parents ever really saw what happened here, they’d scorch the place to the ground.

Okay, so I didn’t have actual photos, and realistically, Callum and maybe Mrs. Greer were my only real witnesses. But my dad did have influential friends. A couple had just moved here to open a firm. If push came to shove, I had backup.

There were times last year I ended up in the nurse’s office with bloody lips and chunks of hair torn out. I always found some excuse. But my parents should’ve noticed. Maddox had done nothing. If he got burned now, he’d deserve it.

""Maddie, wait!"" Violet called.

I stopped, crossed my arms.

""What?""

""Don’t take that tone with me.""

She flipped her red curls over one shoulder and gave me a too-sweet smile.

""I just wanted to talk. Like old times.""

I snorted. ""Oh, you mean those times when you pretended to like me while mocking me behind my back?""

""Come on, don’t be like that. I miss you.""

She sounded sincere. Almost. But I knew better. I’d already fallen for this once—when she lured me to that party just to ditch me in the woods. Three hours I walked to get home. Three fucking hours.

""What do you want, Violet?""

The mask slipped. Her smile fell. ""Are you and Jace together again?""

I blinked, stunned.

""Because if you are,"" she continued, ""just know he was with me last night. He doesn’t love you. And if this is revenge—""

My laughter interrupted her. I doubled over, laughing so hard my stomach hurt.

""It’s not fucking funny, you bitch! You already stole him from me once. Just let me have him!""

Pathetic. I finally stopped laughing.

""I didn’t steal anyone. He was my boyfriend. He cheated on me—with you.""

She scoffed.

""You should be grateful he even wanted you.""

My brows shot up.

""Oh yeah. I should definitely feel lucky that someone pretended to love me just to take my virginity and leave me in pieces.""

Her face faltered.

""He took your virginity?""

I nodded, voice flat. ""Told the whole school, too.""

Her gaze dropped.

""I thought he made that up.""

""Yeah, well. Believe what you want.""

I turned away, heading toward the library. I didn’t care what lies he’d fed her. He was toxic. And I was done.

""Wait, Maddie!""

She grabbed my wrist. I whirled around.

""What now?""

""You’re really not with him?""

""No. I’d never let him touch me again. But he did give me a gift today. Said he wanted to apologize.""

Did I tell her that just to twist the knife? Maybe. Did I want her to remember it was my birthday? Definitely. Did I hope she’d think twice before crawling back to him? Also yes.

Violet’s face softened. ""Your birthday... I forgot.""

I shrugged. ""We’re not friends. Don’t beat yourself up.""

""Right,"" she murmured.

""Anything else? Or can I go now?""

She rolled her eyes. ""Whatever, nerd. You should be glad I didn’t hit you like I used to last year.""

I watched her stalk away, red curls bouncing.

I shook my head.

Same old Violet.

1lcxa9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1lcxa9t/filler_made_from_sawdust_mixed_with_pva_too_dark/,Filler made from sawdust mixed with PVA too dark.,"Hey all.

I've recently sanded an Oak kitchen worktop down as close as I could get it given there was a fair bit of damgae.

Previous owners of the house presumably didn't upkeep this and there was a fair bit of damage (some surface, other sections quite deep around the taps).

Last sand was 180 grit as this seemed to be the consensus for finishing with Osmo top oil.

Applied a thin layer with a microfibre cloth (rather than paintbrush) and gave this two coats.

Wanted a lighter finish than what was originally laid down (\*think it was Danish Oil as I found a tin of this under the sink).

Next to the sink where the pots go to drain the wood had badly split (almost beginning to rot/mould) and the gap on one end where it had split was around 8mm).

I decided to mix the sanded dust with PVA and fill that way but as you can see, it's ended up rather dark.

It's still indented so there's room to add filler on top (unfortunately I'd already applied the Osmo) but I'm not sure how best to do this.

This will sit under a draining board (that drains directly into the sink btw) so won't be on show.  
But as the rest of the worktop came up better than I'd expected it would be nice to finish this better than it is.

Also, how long would you expect to leave the kitchen items (kettle/coffee machine/chopping board etc) until this is fully cured?   Two weeks or is that more for keeping water away as miuch as possible?

You're the best thing that's ever been mine.""




I have seen a lot.

I have met so many people,

I have experienced a lot,

But apart from everything, you've been my best shot.


You've been heavenly.

You have been way too lovely.

You have made my whole being shine,

'Cause, baby, you're the best thing that's ever been mine.


I never wanted to disappoint you.

I never wanted to make you sad,

But sweetheart, I have always loved you,

More than anyone else could've ever had.


I wish you saw me for what I am to you.

I wish you saw right through my walls.

I never meant to be defensive with you,

I wish you never ignored my calls.


I have so much to say,

But you don't want to hear.

I can't even describe the pain,

'Cause it would be too graphic to hear.


But just to paint a rough picture,

I feel like someone stabbed me,

Cut my heart and gave it a million punctures,

And gnawed my brain out of me.

It's not even accurate,

This description lacks substance,

But what hurt the most, is your hate-

Your lack of care, and your sheer resistance.



I hope you realize your mistake,

I hope you see what we have built doesn't need to fall apart.

I pray I will see you someday at any rate,

In that bookstore we talked about.



I accidentally run into you,

You recognise me,

Ask me how I have been, if anything's new,

While you fervidly look at me.


We head out together,

Catching up, smiling,

And I suggest us getting coffee together,

Thanking my fortune for this perfect timing.


I watch you sipping your coffee, looking so good,

You haven't changed at all, babygirl,

I recognise that awkward smile, as I should,

And I lean in to whisper in your ear, ""You never fail to make my heart swirl""


Ah, such is a man's mind,

Adept at creativity,

Creating situations best of their kind,

Without lacking the sensitivity.


I will be okay-

Time heals everything,

But if you ever need me, just send a ""hey!"",

And I'd be there for you, don't doubt a thing!

That’s just a made up example but yeah, I don’t want inflict my society on people or be overly intense but because of that I tend to find I hang back and wait for them to take the initiative / escalate the friendship which likely comes across as anti-social and standoffish which likely discourages them from doing so.

From Rhonda Patrick's new episode about the longevity benefits of coffee. [**Here is the timestamp.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2719s)

I think a lot of people know about how l-theanine calms the caffeine jitters, but it seems to actually amplify coffee's cognitive benefits as well 

From her [**show notes**](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/coffee)**:**

>On its own, L-theanine can induce relaxation, improve focus, and promote sleep. But the real power comes when it's combined with coffee (caffeine)—which appears to alter the pharmacological profile of coffee and influence its effects on cognition and the nervous system. This combo is a popular combination among those who are sensitive to caffeine or those who want focus without the jitters.

>Adding L-theanine to coffee has been demonstrated to:

>**Enhance focus:** It [improves attention, speed, and accuracy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18681988/#:%7E:text=in%2027%20participants,performance%20on%20cognitively%20demanding%20tasks) and reduces distractions and mind-wandering during cognitively demanding tasks.

>**Lower anxiety:** On its own, L-theanine has anxiolytic effects. When combined with caffeine, it reduces anxiety and tension, particularly during stressful scenarios like test taking.

>**Reduce ""jitters"":** It mitigates side effects of caffeine [including blood pressure spikes and the ""wired"" feeling](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25761837/#:%7E:text=,interaction%20between%20these%20substances) that caffeine can cause in some people—providing a relaxed yet focused state.

>The mechanism behind the L-theanine and caffeine synergy is that L-theanine seems to balance caffeine-induced stimulation by calming the brain—notably by increasing the activity of alpha waves ([an effect that occurs within 45 minutes of taking L-theanine](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301051107001573)). Because L-theanine increases the inhibitory, calming neurotransmitter known as GABA as well as dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, it *reduces* excitation and provides a relaxing but not sedating effect. Importantly, taking L-theanine with caffeine doesn't alter the *metabolism* of caffeine—only its subjective and physiological effects. That means you still need to be cautious about not drinking coffee too close to bedtime.

>Practically, here's the recommendation if you're interested in maximizing the cognitive benefits of your coffee:

>\- Pair about one cup of coffee (100–150 mg caffeine) with 100–200 mg L-theanine for a 1:2 or a 2:1 ratio of L-theanine:caffeine  
\- Take them at the same time—they have similar absorption kinetics, so simultaneous intake works best.  
\-You can easily find L-Theanine as a powder or capsule; it dissolves directly into coffee and has minimal taste (and isn't degraded by heat).  
\- This combination is safe, well-studied, and low-risk at these doses.
