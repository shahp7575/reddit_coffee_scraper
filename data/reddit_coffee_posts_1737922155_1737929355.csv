This book was free on Apple Books and I read it when I was 9 on my iPad mini. The book was amazing series but I only read the first book and it ended in a cliff hanger 

From what I remember, the girl is left with the guilt of leaving her best friend behind and I remember his name being like Elliot or smth. So after she gets let go by the kidnappers she goes to this woman‚Äôs house who calls the cops for her. Then it makes huge headlines and she‚Äôs constantly being interviewed by the police and the press. She ends up moving a lot and it‚Äôs known in the book that she‚Äôs really pretty. Because of the guilt she has a therapist who encourages her to do gym and drink coffee?? She works out like a lot. I remember the mom being really distant and she had a boyfriend, the dad is gone I think? 

She ends up meeting this guy at a library or smth and he‚Äôs described to be so handsome and every girl wants to date him. She goes to dinner with this guy and she‚Äôs also like not ur ‚Äútypical girl‚Äù and wears sweatpants to this fancy dinner place where he takes her. The guy pays in lots of cash and she finds it strange. Then they get close I think and she finds out he‚Äôs a pick pocketer, hence the big wads of cash. Then at the end she realised that this guy is her childhood best friend who got kidnapped in the beginning of the book. I remember some fight scene at the end??  At the end he tells her to come with him to go somewhere but I honestly can‚Äôt remember. 

If anyone thinks they know the book please let me know!! I‚Äôve been trying to figure out the name of the book for ages!! ",1,1737929126.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False

1iaru1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1iaru1q/the_doctor_of_dallas_part_3_final_part/,The Doctor of Dallas Part 3 (Final part),"From the desk of Dr. Richard Cephalo.

I could see why Sam had described it as a warehouse. From a distance, that's exactly what it looked like. It was a large, concrete building that bore the unmistakable brutalist architecture that almost all commercial property had in the area. It was only when I drove up to the chain-linked fence surrounding the area that I could see the sign over the entrance that read ‚ÄúWellwood Sanitarium.‚Äù

On the list of things that I would not want to be doing at half past four in the morning, exploring an abandoned mental asylum in an attempt to discover the dumping grounds of a murderer was at the very top of it. If I hadn't been picturing the faces of Erica and my wife, I would have gotten back into my car and drove away, but desperation compelled me where courage failed.

I thought about calling the police for the hundreth time since I saw the location on Google, but once again thought about how useless they've been for the past year. I imagined them driving by the building, looking once at it, and then driving on. I wondered what I could tell them that would actually get them to go into the building. The more I thought about what I would tell them, the less sane it all sounded to me.

‚ÄúYes, I heard from some crazy homeless people that a guy called the Doctor is taking people off the street and doing... something to them. I was then assured by a lady high on black tar heroin that this place was somehow connected. Could you please waste your time and resources to enter this building and check it out?‚Äù

If I could bring them some kind of evidence, maybe then they'd actually open an investigation that wasn't just for the sake appearances. I was hoping to provide them a body since I still wasn't allowing myself the luxury of hoping they were alive.

As I hopped over the fence and started making my way to the entrance of the building, I once again reminded myself that this was to get justice for my wife, for Erica, for the others. I wasn't going to let myself entertain delusions of a rescue mission. It would be too painful when I found their rotting bodies. If I found them.

The doors of the building had been boarded up at one point, but I could see that one of the boards had been pried off of the structure and a window smashed in. The thought of the police entered my mind for the hundred and first time. I finally decided I would compromise with myself and pulled out my cell phone. I punched in nine, one, one and didn't call. I'd keep it ready to call out at a moment's notice though.

I stepped through the makeshift hole into the building, hearing the crunch of broken glass under my feet like some kind of industrial facsimile of snow, the sound echoing around the darkened corridors and making my heart race. The first strange thing I noticed was the lack of graffiti. In a city where even the inhabited structures would be marked with street art, this building had none of it. I thought back to how Sam, the homeless man from earlier in the night, had said no one goes in here, and felt sick to my stomach.

I turned on the flashlight on my phone, casting the glare up and down the hallways as I walked. Near the entrance, there was a glass case with a series of photos in it. They seemed to be different medical personnel that had worked in the hospital, names and titles printed beneath each image. I spared it a glance and continued on, not exactly sure what I was looking for.

After a few minutes, I came to a stairwell, leading both up and down. I ended up deciding I'd check upstairs first, climbing each step carefully and trying my hardest to listen to the stillness over the thumping of my heart in my ears.

When I graced the top of the stairs, I thought I was on the set of a horror movie. It was a grid like series of hallways lined with doors that were so close together, there was no doubt that they were cells. I glanced through the little glass window of one door and saw they were padded rooms. I couldn't help but think of being stuck in one of these cells, thrashing away with no one to listen to my panicked screams. I pushed the thought out of my mind and continued on, finding nothing but more of the same. I knew at this point I was putting off what I dreaded the most: going downstairs to the basement area.

I retraced my steps back to the stairwell and began making my way downwards. Each descending step I took were like the days ticking down to Armageddon, the end of days waiting in the looming darkness of the underground. When I reached the end, I saw two doors propped open and felt my heart jump into my throat. Someone had kept these doors open for a reason, and it was the first evidence of humanity I've found in this place. At least, I hoped it was humanity, feeling that it could just as well of been a demonic presence that seen fit to fix these heavy wooden doors open.

I passed the threshold and the baleful light of my phone struggled to illuminate the wide space I was in. The floor was dirty, covered in so much dust that it was almost like walking on dirt. I figured if I was going to find a body, it would surely be in here. Before I could venture too deep into this realm of nightmares, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. I turned off the light on my phone, crouching behind a gurney I was near. I could see a beam come from the stairs, looking like a searchlight hovering back and forth in the basement. It revealed more of the room to me, and I could see that it was full of discarded wheelchairs, crash carts and other derelict medical equipment.

I was certain I was about to be killed. I held my breath as I watched a silhouette wielding the light began walking up and down the breadth of the place. My eyes began to play tricks on me in high contrast of light and darkness, and I could of sworn I saw figures moving just outside the light and huddling in the corners of the room. The imposing figure with the flashlight suddenly spoke.

‚ÄúYou can't be down here, come on! It isn't safe and you're trespassing!‚Äù

As he stepped forward in front of me, I could make out the uniform of a security guard in the gloom. My heart began to settle down, just as my hiding space was illuminated and I stood up and raised up my hands to show I was no danger.

‚ÄúSorry, I'll leave right away, sir,‚Äù I heard my panicked voice say, echoing off of the walls and sounding much too loud in this empty place.

‚ÄúBuddy, why would you want to be down here anyways? Come on back upstairs, I'll walk you to the door.‚Äù

Now that I could see the security guard a little better, I could see he was a middle aged man with salt and pepper hair, and a mustache sprouting from beneath a long nose. I almost chuckled, thinking he looked like a cartoonist's rendition of a security guard.

‚ÄúSorry, I was looking around here because I thought it looked cool,‚Äù was only excuse I could come up with, and it sounded stupid as hell to my own ears. However, the security guard seemed to agree.

‚ÄúHey, you don't 'have to tell me. There's just something about abandoned places that draw people into it. Still, I can't have the property owners being liable for someone falling through a dilapidated floor and breaking their neck.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I get it. I'm sorry, I didn't think about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Stanley, by the way,‚Äù the guard said reaching out to shake my hand, which I took and replied by introducing myself as well.

‚ÄúI'm Robert, good to meet you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, Robert, let's grab a cup of coffee from my office real quick, and you can tell me what you were actually doing here.‚Äù

I immediately liked Stanley, and if there was anything going on in this creepy place, he would be an invaluable resource of information. He led me back towards the entrance, stopping just short of it and opening what I had taken for a maintenance closet. Inside, he flipped a switch and a light came on, illuminating a desk, a few chairs and a coffee maker that sat in the corner. He sat down his flashlight and began pouring grounds into the coffee maker followed by water from a gallon jug he kept under the desk.

‚ÄúSo why in the world would you come to an abandoned insane asylum at this time of night anyways?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it's going to sound crazy...‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, you're in the right place for that,‚Äù Stanley said with a deep laugh.

‚ÄúMaybe I am. My wife went missing a year ago and I heard this place could be connected to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat seems like a bit of stretch, Robert. Where did you get that idea?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom some homeless people, they had been convinced there was someone hurting people and that I'd find something here.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like an urban legend to me. Sorry to hear about your wife though, that's pretty rough. I lost my brother and sister a when I was a kid, so I know how something like that can hit you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm sorry to hear that, what happened?‚Äù

Stanley sat a coffee cup in front of me and I took a long sip as he sat down across the desk from me and leaned back with a heavy sigh.

‚ÄúIt was a long time ago. I think I was ten years old. My little brother went missing and my older sister went out to find him. Never found out what had happened to them, just that they found their bodies out in a park a few weeks later. There's monsters out there, buddy. Monsters who don't think twice about killing women and children. I couldn't imagine what kind of sick thoughts run through their mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what you mean. I see a lot of that kind of stuff in my business.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, what do you do Robert?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm a psychologist. Usually, my job is just talking and listening to people to get them to think through what's bothering them, but I also volunteer at prisons, and there's some real horror shows out there. Still, it's not the ones behind bars that scare me...‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's the ones who aren't,‚Äù he finished for me.

‚ÄúYea... Knowing they exist is scary. Like a sheep seeing the wolves that circle them.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike the guy the homeless people told you about?‚Äù

‚ÄúYea, they call him the Doctor. They even have a creepy rhyme about him.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like a hell of a ghost story if I ever heard one,‚Äù he said with another small laugh.

‚ÄúYea, they say he targets red headed young boys and blonde haired women.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, my little brother had red hair and my sister was a blonde... maybe that's why I do it?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù I asked, suddenly confused and feeling all the warmth being sucked out of the room as a shiver ran down my spine.

‚ÄúOh, you know, Robert. Fix people. I don't like the Doctor name though. Doctors diagnose you. Now surgeons, they're the ones who work on you. They're the ones that do the fixing.‚Äù

I felt sick and tried to stand up, but my legs crumpled and I fell down against the floor, hard. The coffee cup I had been drinking from fell and crashed to the floor in front of me, my mind catching up to what had just happened.

‚ÄúDon't fight it, Robert. It's okay, It's just a little something to keep you from moving too much,‚Äù he said with another short laugh, sounding genuinely comforting despite the sinister implications he was speaking of.

‚ÄúIt's true what I said earlier, Robert. I couldn't imagine what those sick fucks who kill women and children think about. I've never killed anyone. No, I don't hurt people, I fix them. And I'm going to fix you too, Robert.‚Äù

He stood up and reached under his desk, coming up with a black leather bag, like the ones old Doctors would carry when they made house calls. I fought to push myself upright, but my muscles weren't cooperating.

‚ÄúIt's a shame about Sam. He was just here, by the way. I was just prepping him for surgery when I heard you stumbling around in here. Now, you're gonna have to wait your turn but it shouldn't take long,‚Äù he said, digging around in the bag and coming up with a a bottle and a rag.

‚ÄúFamilies get torn apart, Robert. They get torn apart by time, by tragedy, by monsters. I'm not tearing families apart, I'm putting one together. And you're gonna love being part of that family. Do you understand, Robert?‚Äù

I didn't like the way he kept saying my name, as if he was trying to get used to it, tasting it on his tongue and developing a pallet for it. He kept repeating it, each time making my stomach churn.

He started dousing the rag with the bottle, continuing to speak.

‚ÄúI used to work here back in the day, Robert. I was an orderly. I was the one that would come in and subdue patients that got out of hand. They called it 'booty juice,' that shit we'd stick them with. We'd shoot them up through the ass, which is where it got its nickname. They'd go limp and calm down immediately, until it wore off and they freaked out again. You see, psychologists like yourself are going about it all wrong. The problem is in the brain, not the mouth and ears, Robert.‚Äù

He bent down with the rag, close enough that I could smell his cologne. Roses, lemons and cloves. He had a comforting smile, and I almost felt myself relaxing as he placed a hand on my shoulder. Almost.

‚ÄúDon't do this, Stanley. Please don't do this...‚Äù I pleaded as my lips became harder and harder to maneuver against the effects of whatever he had slipped me. While I talked, I managed to dig one of my hands into my pocket, trying to get to my phone.

‚ÄúDon't worry, Robert. I know you're scared, but like I said, I don't hurt people. I fix them.‚Äù

The rag was shoved over my mouth and nose. I held my breath and kept concentrating on my phone that gave a little buzz as the fingerprint reader acknowledged me and it opened. I pressed what I hoped was the call out button and then could fight it no longer. I inhaled and my vision began to darken at the corners.

‚ÄúGo to sleep, Robert. Sleep and dream of your wife. Dream of freedom. Dream of your new family.‚Äù

My vision flickered, threatening to dissolve as my lungs demanded that I breath in. I could feel Stanley's large hand forcing the rag against my face. I also heard the faint sound of a busy tone, realizing I must of punched in some extra numbers by mistake when I went to call out. The police weren't coming.

Suddenly, the door was thrown open and I saw Sam rush into view. He was wearing a hospital gown and had blood streaming down his wrists. He barreled into Stanley, punching and kicking wildly. I began crawling out of the door, hearing a commotion of meaty thuds behind me, but not bothering to look back to see who was winning. I scrambled out into the hallway, my legs and arms barely working. I heard a mighty crash and splintering wood and silently prayed Sam was winning his fight.

My prayers went unanswered as Stanley grabbed me from behind and forced the rag back over my face. As my vision begin to vanish entirely, I could see a faint silvery glow coming from the entrance of the building. The morning sun was just outside my reach. I almost made it.

Then, darkness.

When I woke up, I was strapped to a gurney. I was back in the basement and I could see a bright light shining from the center of the room. There was another figure on a gurney there, and as the face turned towards me, I could see it was Sam.

‚ÄúSorry, mister,‚Äù he whispered.

Stanley walked in front of him, severing my view of his face. He was wearing a surgeon's gown and had the doctor bag in his left hand. He sat it down on a surgical cart next to him and begin to rummage around inside it while humming.

I saw something move in the shadows and slowly became aware of people lining the darkness. They barely moved at all, but I could see them there.

‚ÄúNow, Sam, you have a very important decision to make. I need you to choose. Will it be the eye or the nose?‚Äù

I tried to wrap my head around what Stanley was doing, but all I could see was his back.

‚ÄúI choose for you to go fuck yourself,‚Äù came Sam's calm voice.

I wasn't nearly as brave, so I started struggling against the binds that were securing me, my heart thumping hard as one of the figures in the dark started making its way towards me.

‚ÄúSam... it's time to choose. Will it be your nose or your eye?‚Äù

The figure closed in on me and I almost screamed. It was Becca. It was my wife.

‚ÄúOkay, Sam, eye it is. Don't worry, it sounds worse than it is,‚Äù came Stanley's voice across the room.

Becca looked like some sort of ghost, he hair knotted and tangled, covered in grease. She had a vacant look in her eyes. I had been prepared for a dead body, I had been prepared for bones, but I hadn't been prepared for this. She said nothing as she began to undo my straps.

I could hear Sam screaming. I've never heard a human scream like that, high pitched and full of agony. I could hear a pinging sound, metal on metal. The first strap was pulled free and Becca stared at me with unseeing eyes, a little drool pooling at the corner of her mouth. I pulled the other strap free as quietly as I could and began working on my feet.

Sam's scream had changed. As the pinging sound continued, he began to sound more like a wounded animal than a person. It was becoming less a scream and more of a loud groaning sound.

Ping. Ping. Ping.

I freed my legs and quietly crept over the side of my gurney, feeling all my fear turn into white hot hatred. Stanley had told me that he couldn't fathom what went through the minds of those who killed people, but in that moment, I understood perfectly.

I silently walked over to Stanley who was too intent on his ‚Äúsurgery‚Äù to notice me. Sam had gone completely quiet now, the sound of his moans drowned out by the ringing of the hammer on the metal pin that was shoved into the side of his eye.

The doctor bag was on the cart just behind him, and I reached in, retrieving the rag and bottle from before. I tried not to even breath as I worked, dousing the rag in chloroform.

‚ÄúSee, Sam, nothing to be scared of. You're all better now,‚Äù I heard Stanley saying. He started to turn to the gurney I had woken up on.

‚ÄúAlright Robert, it's your-‚Äù he stopped seeing me standing just behind him.

I screamed out, all my fear evolving into a rage I hadn't felt before and pressed the rag over his face while punching him repeatedly in the ear. He stumbled backwards, knocking over the gurney with Sam on it and giving out a muffled cry as I kept the rag against his face.

‚ÄúGo to sleep, Stan! Just go to sleep and have nightmares of the hell I'm about to send you to!‚Äù I heard myself screaming in fury.

Stanley was a big man, but I had caught him off guard. My rage and adrenaline lent me strength I hadn't known I possessed as I battered him. His struggles became weaker and weaker.

When he stopped moving, I looked over at Sam. A trickle of blood was coming from his eye where Stanley had shoved the needle during his lobotomy. I felt tears welling up in my eyes, but they weren't tears of sadness. They were tears of anger.

When Stanley finally awoke, he was strapped to the same gurney that he had put Sam on earlier. He struggled against the straps and looked up at me.

‚ÄúDon't kill me, Robert! I helped them! I fixed them!‚Äù

I didn't respond, I was too angry to. Instead, I grabbed a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the doctor bag and began dousing Stanley's struggling form with it.

‚ÄúRobert, I helped them! I helped them!‚Äù

I pulled out my cigarettes, the same pack I had earlier that day when I gave one of the cigarettes to the crazy old lady outside the bar. I lit one and took a deep drag off it.

‚ÄúYou know, my wife wanted me to quit smoking. I always told her I would, but never got around to it. Especially after she went missing,‚Äù I whispered, glancing at my wife sitting in the corner among the other dozen or so victims crowding the edges of the basement. I could see her face catch the light very slightly, looking completely vacant, though I thought I saw the corners of her mouth turn up very slightly as I spoke.

‚ÄúRobert, let me go. I'll turn myself in. You can call the cops. Just don't do this,‚Äù said Stanley quietly, though I wasn't listening. I was too busy staring at the face of the woman I loved. The woman he had kidnapped, lobotomized and held for a year.

‚ÄúI think your little brother ran away from you because he hated you,‚Äù I said absentmindedly.

Stanley stopped thrashing and went still, his mouth opening and closing as he tried to form words.

‚ÄúYou know, I kept wondering how come I didn't call the police when I came here. I kept telling myself it was because I was worried about them not doing their jobs, just dismissing my call or something, but that wasn't it. I didn't call them because you'd end up in prison. I've seen what it's like for the people there, and believe it or not, they all acclimate to it.‚Äù

I resumed pouring the rubbing alcohol over Stanley's bound form, emptying the bottle and pulling out my lighter.

‚ÄúI don't know if you'll acclimate to fire or not. Maybe you'll get used to it after a while, when you're burning in hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúRobert, don't. Don't!‚Äù

I sparked the lighter and stood back, the fire spreading quickly as it ate the fumes from the alcohol. Stanley screamed as it consumed him, but I wasn't looking. I had seen all I had come to see.

There's forgotten places in the world, places where predators discard the bones of their prey. They leave them to rot into dust like offerings to the world so that their crimes would be forgotten. That was Stanley now, the notorious Doctor of Dallas. He was a burning sacrament to those he had ‚Äúfixed.‚Äù

I led his victims outside to the early morning sun and called the authorities. I didn't tell them that I had lit Stanley on fire and they never found a body, so I guess I'm not going to go to prison for murder.

I didn't see Erica reunite with her mother, though I can imagine how hard that must have been for Mrs. Watkins. I hear that Sam is making a recovery at a long term facility in Houston. He's able to speak, at least. He's getting better every day.

As for Becca, I've been looking after her. She's home now, and the photos of her that used to look at me so accusingly have softened. She's getting better, though I know she'll never be the same. It's been a couple months and she's starting to talk now and again. It's small phrases, usually one word, though she said she loved me last night and I've never felt such hope in all my life.

I thought I'd put all of this behind me and keep living my life one day at a time. Yet, every time I go to the store, I find myself looking at the wall of missing people, and last week noticed something familiar. Blonde women and red headed children have started going missing again. Stanley's body was never recovered, so he could still be out there, ‚Äúfixing‚Äù people with his obscene style of medicine. It keeps me up at night, but having Becca home is enough for me.

I mostly managed to move on, though I had a disturbing experience when I went down to the homeless encampment in Arlington. I was bringing them clothes, blankets and food since I found a new appreciation for the horrors they face. I saw the crazy cart lady again, and I gave her a whole carton of cigarettes for being the catalyst that led to me finding my wife again. I offered to get her more help, but she told me she prefers to live among her people.

I didn't push the issue, instead I just started walking back to my car where Becca waited in the passenger seat and smiled blissfully at nothing. As I was getting into the car, I saw a young homeless woman sitting by herself on the edge of the encampment, her sing song voice carrying to my ears...

‚ÄúThe doctor carries his doctor bag

He makes you sleepy with his doctor rag

He thumps away with his doctor hammer

Until he makes you yammer and stammer

He dresses you up in his doctor clothes

He smells of roses, lemon, and cloves

He'll fix you from your head to your shin

And the last thing you see is his doctor grin

The doctor is in, the doctor is in

And the last thing you see is his doctor grin!‚Äù",1,1737928977.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Forgive me father but I have sinned, it's been a while since I've acknowledged the traditional owners of this land (at least 30 minutes), past, present and emerging. 

My identity is 41yo F binary hetro with 3 kids and am separated from my husband for around 1 year now.

Basically, I'm looking to sell the house or donate it to first nations people.

My ex legally paid down the mortgage balance on this $1.6mil 4 bed, 2 bath, 2 garage and handed the title over to me. He also pays child support which I'm looking to redirect to first nations people.

I also bought a Tesla which I'm not fond of anymore and I've listed it on car sales. 

2 of my kids are working now so they are producing money, the other is only 2 years old and is a future NDIS service client and probably no help just yet 

All in all, if I sell the house, the Tesla, maybe redirected my husbands child support money and sold the contents of the home, I think theres enough of a donation there.

My 89yo cis white hetro F grandmah can look after the kids until I find a place to rent  - she still works 4 days a week packing coffee beans god bless her.

Does all this sound ok? Or am I being irrational? Maybe I should keep the house. I just don't know anymore.

1iarj24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EIU/comments/1iarj24/eiu_eastern_illinois_university_for_international/,EIU (Eastern Illinois University) for International Students,"Hi everyone, I am an international student studying at EIU, doing my undergraduate degree here. I decided to write a short review for international students who are debating whether to choose this university or not.

Overall, the university itself is known for having a relatively high acceptance rate, a safe campus, and affordable costs. For 2024-2025, I‚Äôve paid around $26-27k, which includes book rental, health insurance, international tuition, fees, housing, and dining. The university is popular for its teaching program‚Äîa lot of people here do their English or Education major. Most of the international students do their master‚Äôs degree here because it‚Äôs relatively easy to get into/complete. I can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs easy to find a job after graduating, but I feel like it‚Äôs the current job market situation in US.

Location:
First of all, if you‚Äôre from a big city, be prepared for Charleston, because it‚Äôs really in the middle of nowhere. So, obviously, there‚Äôs basically NOTHING to do outside. The ‚Äúwow, small town, so quaint‚Äù thing lasts for a couple of weeks, and then you realize that you have to spend your 2 or 4 years of studying here.

The city itself is very safe. I‚Äôve never heard of any crimes happening here, except for small ones like bike thefts. The campus is safe too‚Äîmost of the time Charleston Police are patrolling, and there are many emergency stations throughout the campus. The townies are mostly old people and some meth millennials, but they never approach you.

The city doesn‚Äôt have much, just small local restaurants with Thai, Mexican, or fast food. The only supermarkets here are Walmart, Aldi, and County Market‚Ä¶ and that is all‚Ä¶ absolutely nothing to do. 

Professors and Class Sizes:
What I love the most here is the nice professors. Most of them have PhDs, are true professionals, and really know what they‚Äôre doing. A lot of my professors genuinely care, sharing their knowledge and personal life experiences. Some of them can even become your closest friends.

Relatively speaking, about half of the professors are American and half are international, but the teaching quality is good overall. Most of the time, there are no TA/GAs teaching, so you have a chance to interact with your professor directly. Class sizes are great too‚Äîusually around 20-25 people or fewer. Most students like the small class sizes because it‚Äôs easier to explain your thoughts without feeling judged.

People:
A lot of creeps‚Ä¶ so be aware of your surroundings and don‚Äôt trust everyone, no matter if they‚Äôre local or international. But overall, people here are really nice and respectful‚Äîprofessors, university staff, and students included. The city has a lot of churches, so people here are generally safe. There‚Äôs also a big Indian community, African community, and even a Muslim association. Most of the international students are more than welcome to help you.

Studying Overall:
Some professors are really chill, and some of them are strict‚Äîit really depends. But I wouldn‚Äôt say this school is particularly strong academically. It all depends on you and what you make of your classes. From my experience, studying here is pretty easy. MOST professors are chill, but they are very strict about academic honesty.

It feels like some (most) of local people don‚Äôt study that much or hard, so it‚Äôs pretty easy to excel academically here. Plus, university provides a looot of resources and events/department help: careers center, advisors and free tutors/mentors, honors society, that are there to help you plan your academic path.

Dining Options:
There are only 3-4 dining options, and I suggest getting the basic meal plan, which gives you 7 meal swipes per week. Every hall has a decent kitchen where you can cook because dining hall food is just terrible.

Currently, only two dining halls are actually operating, plus one small convenience store with a very limited selection of products (mostly snacks), and one dining facility with Chick-fil-A, sushi, and Mexican food. The dining hall food is mostly trashy. They don‚Äôt change the menu often, so most of the options repeat week after week. Be prepared for oily, fast-food-like meals. It‚Äôs much better to cook for yourself than to eat there all the time. Plus, during fall, spring, and summer breaks, the dining halls don‚Äôt even operate, so you‚Äôll need to figure out food on your own.

Housing Options:
All freshmen are required to live on campus and have a meal plan. Some of the residence halls aren‚Äôt operational, but they still have a lot of good options. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs bad‚Äîthe buildings and furniture are old, but at least they‚Äôre clean.

Every floor has common bathrooms, toilets, and a laundry room. The bathrooms are cleaned 3-4 times a week. Each floor also has an RA who can help with housing, academic, or personal problems. Plus, every hall organizes a lot of activities, which is something I really like.

However, be prepared for additional charges, because they always seem to want to make extra money off international students. For example, during short 1-week breaks, you‚Äôll have to pay $125 per week just to stay in your dorm‚Äîand that doesn‚Äôt include food.

To live outside of campus is the best option you can do, because you will save a lot of money. I can‚Äôt say that dining and housing contract is worth it‚Äîdef better to stay on your own. If you‚Äôll do your research, you can find many places/apartments to stay.

University Activities:
The university tries to organize multiple events and activities to help you grow connections, excel academically, or just spend your time. They even host separate events for international students. You can check their website or Instagram for updates‚Äîthey share most events there. They also provide lots of goodies and free food at these events.

Transportation:
The university provides Panther Shuttle buses that operate 7 days a week throughout Charleston, so you can get to Walmart for free. But other than that, it‚Äôs almost impossible to get to other places‚Äîyou HAVE to get a car here.

It‚Äôs a 3-4 hour drive to Chicago, but they charge you $100 to get to or from Chicago. The international office sometimes provides free transportation the week before classes start, usually for the fall semester. They also offer free transportation to bigger cities for food shopping, but if you want to go to Chicago, you‚Äôll need to find someone to take you to the nearest Amtrak station (in Mattoon) and then head to your destination. You really can‚Äôt do anything here without a car.

Jobs and Scholarships:
You‚Äôre only allowed to work on campus for up to 20 hours a week. The university pays a minimum wage of $15/hour, but job options are very limited. Most departments, like the library, coffee shop, or even dining, have long waitlists.

The easiest job to get is in dining, where you‚Äôll actually get around 20 hours a week, but you‚Äôll probably have to wait a whole semester to get hired. The library alone has a waitlist of 300-500 people. Unless you have good connections in a department, finding a job is tough. And working off-campus illegally isn‚Äôt an option‚Äîthis town is so small that even locals struggle to find jobs.

Scholarships for international students are also very hard to get.

International Office / University Support: 
I can‚Äôt say people here had an ideal or positive experience with the international office. In the most of the departments, the staff is really slow or lazy, and solving your problems requires a lot of patience. 

Overall:
I would not recommend this university for international undergrads. A lot of students transfer each semester, and most international undergrads want to transfer too. The only thing keeping them here is the cost‚Äîit‚Äôs relatively cheap compared to other universities. My experience here is a 5/10. My advice for you‚Äîto make a research on your university! Don‚Äôt rely just on the good reputation, price or program. I hope this review will help you, and this is just my opinion.",1,1737928192.0,EIU,0,1.0,False

I'm a massive fan of your videos Charlotte, they are highlight of my day. I'm so excited for you both and for your upcoming wedding. üííüë∞ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇüíç

To the story, I'm not sure if this fits in petty revenge, divorce drama, AITA? or something else. So here goes, this maybe a bit of a long one so grab your tea/coffee and some delicious snacks...... ‚òïÔ∏èüçµüç°

Ok a bit of the back story, this is important to understand, so you understand why my petty revenge and divorce drama was so perfect: 

(I'm dyslexic so please excuse spelling and grammar mistakes). 

I met my ex Husband (34M) (let's call him Dickie because W@nker will be flagged), He was a 6ft, average build, ugly man, nothing special, average man all over (4/10), I was an 18F I was better than average but nothing special looks wise, pretty with high cheekbones and amazing skin, I did have a wonderful hourglass figure, slim waist, nice hips, long legs and big boobs, 5ft 4 (6/10) I've definitely got better looking with age. I was still at 6th form college doing my A-levels. I was definitely out of his league. No one understood why I was with him because we didn‚Äôt look right together. Not just because of the 16 year age gap. He quite often got called my father. ü§£ü§£ü§£

I was  bought up by a narcissist father who love bombed and gas lighted me, physically, emotionally, and mentally abused me and made me question my own sanity, plus loads more. I was the scapegoat of the 3 siblings. So this was the only type of love I understood and life that I knew. So as you can imagine I had no self esteem or self worth at this.point in my life and definitely not life experiences. So I was an easy target of abusers. 

Anyway we ended up in a relationship, he was extremely charming, treated me like a princess, nothing was ever too much. The beautiful gifts and meals out, holidays, etc. I truly believed I had found my forever soul mate, young, dumb and naive at the time. I had never received this type of love before in my life. ü•∞

Fuck me sideways and hit me with a bus, how wrong was I!!!. ü§¨

We were together for 14 years, 10 years as GF/BF and married for 4 years and had 2 gorgeous children together, and yet he treated me so badly. It happened so slowly that I didn't see it happening and then I was trapped aged 20 living with him. There was DV, emotional, physical, financial and mental abuse. I thought I was going crazy from the gas lighting, and completely lost my own sense of reality. It got extremely depressed and suffered with major anxiety. I was isolated from friends and family. I lost all my support network. I was working full time so he could stay at home. The children were at school so he didn't have to look after them. I was then expected to cook, clean and wash when I got home after my full 8 hours at work and do all the food shopping, I was just the slave living there. Computer games were so much more important than his kids and wife. I also found out, that out of the 14 years we were together he had been having an affair for 12 of those years with let's called her Star, and he fathered a child with her too. Star was also married. üë∂

This is where being AITA comes in. I met a new guy at work (let's call him Dave, we all know a Dave), the job Dickie forced me to get so I could earn more money to put in his bank account. I was working 2 jobs at this point. I started seeing Dave, we didn't actually  have sex or anything. Anyway after 14 years I'd had enough so with the support of my bestie bitch, and a promise made to my Grandma on her deathbed (who passed away 2 months before), and Dave, I finally said enough is enough and I walked out of the relationship. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçü•∞

He filed for a divorce putting adultery as the reason. I just wanted a quick divorce so I was fine with that. Anyway as he was a controlling narcissist he decided that he was going to slow the divorce process down so he could get my inheritance that he knew I would be getting from my Grandma. However my solicitor wrote to him giving him 6 weeks to respond, if he didn't then it would be changed to me divorcing him for adultery. The 6 weeks passed, so I took charge and it went to the courts. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

This is where the best petty revenge and Karma comes in.
As addresses hadn't been changed at the inheritance solicitors the letter went to my old address, Dickie‚Äôs address. Take note of this and the following dates.
Monday - The letter arrived to my old address for me.
Wednesday - My Decree Nisi and his were delivered (this means anything received after this date he had no claim on)
Thursday - He hands me the letter. 
So in panic I rung my solicitor, explained everything and she said leave it with me and send her a photo of the envelope. Moving in the shadows she wrote to Dickies solicitors and sent a photo of the unopened envelope and asked for Dickie to sign and confirm he handed it to me on the Thursday and not Monday or Tuesday. Dickie signed it thinking nothing of it. 
He completely shot himself in the foot!!!! Revenge is sweet. Had he handed me that letter on the Monday or Tuesday he would have been entitled to half of my inheritance. Instead he couldn't claim a penny of it and to make it sweeter it was a large sum of money. ü§£ü§£ü§£

Then the petty Karma tank fully armoured hit him again a year later when he was showing his brother his divorce papers and his brother points out that I divorced him for adultery. He rung me fuming, screaming and shouting at me. He didn't realise it had been switched round. ü§£ü§£ü§£

Am I sorry, FUCK NO, 
Did I deserve the treatment he gave me, FUCK NO. 
Am I now living my best life with my children and new hubby, HELL YES.
Is he still single, bitter and twisted towards me, HELL YES.
Karma hits them in the arse hard in the end.

If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don't hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be redeemed.
Still, life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes something happens better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don't be afraid of its plenty.

Everything was taken from me and for 11 years (now 30 yo) I lived for vengence. But the more I read the bible, I was able to transform my life's philosophy into something that caused me less pain.

I don't know if I should share my full testimony of coming to Christianity because it's a little bit intense, but the main reason was that I had a dream in which a hooded man asked me to ""be reborn"". I posted on Reddit on the same day (10 days before I visited the local church) about ""how to be reborn?"". I was wondering about how to be reborn for months before that because how else do you fix a torn soul? Eventually when I visited the local church the pastor told me to read John and meet him for coffee that day.

I am trying to find better employment, but it is very difficult in this weird area that I live in (Georgia, USA,) so let‚Äôs say getting a better job isn‚Äôt possible right now. 
   The APR on all my cards ranges, but generally run from 26-28%. I made a big choice to move from New York to Georgia to be with my fianc√©, and it‚Äôs been, a struggle, but I‚Äôm getting into a better place where I‚Äôm keeping a closer eye on my finances. We own our home. I‚Äôm not on the deed, as my credit wasn‚Äôt good enough when we first purchased, so I don‚Äôt have a mortgage. 
   We cut down on a lot already. We rarely eat out, we do a lot of home cooking. We don‚Äôt have subscription services because I uh, acquire a lot of my own media. This is a nuclear option for me. I don‚Äôt know how else to proceed with getting drowned in interest every month. I can try to consolidate my debt with a lower interest rate which would help.

Also, my bills are very, small in scope compared to my fianc√©. I pay electricity, ($150-200/month), and water (~$50/month), and my cards. If I get rid of my debt I can help with a lot more around the home, and maybe do things to get some equity in it and move out of Georgia.

Especially for someone who likes to connect on levels that are experiential, spiritual, and intimate. Someone who doesn't mind building a connection slowly over time (as opposed to a casual, one-time thing, or expecting to go straight to the physical), along with trust and communication.

Please - if you do respond, be someone who wants an IRL connection (not just texting, but meeting in person). Also please send an imgur.com link with a picture (I prefer non-smiling - smiles tend to conceal). And write to me about you - the more personal the better, and rambling is fine. I will send a pic with my response. I will also let you know whether I think there is potential for attraction (at least on my part).

Does that sound like something you might be interested in exploring? If so, I look forward to hearing from you. If we're both feeling it, we can meet for a walk/chat/coffee/tea and see what the vibe is. Again, I don't do one-time casual and I don't go straight to the physical. A mental and emotional connection first creates attraction for me.

Btw, I'm attractive enough (nothing earth-shattering, but I look good, esp for a mature woman). I'm kind of short, blondish/brown wavy hair, green eyes, relatively fit build.

I tend to be attracted to the mental and emotional aspects of a person and like men who are intelligent, gentle and thoughtful (nerds, introverts and overthinkers welcome). No cheaters please, and no 'older woman' fetishists - the connection is about who we are as people, not some category we happen to be in.

Sending good vibes to whoever reads this. I wish you blessings and only good things on your journey in life - the right connection is not easy to find and the path can be lonely at times.

We've had ups and downs throughout as any relationship however stuck it through (this is includes going through two short break-ups throughout the years). The past year hasn't been the greatest: tones of arguments and bickering at one another over the smallest of things, however we've always moved past them (in most him cases he moves on quicker than I do). As a result, since the end of the summer last of 2024, I've been having doubts about the relationship and questioning if it's time to leave. My biggest is issue is the lack of passion on my part towards him, and that spark and chemistry being gone for a long time. I would always look forward to any time alone, or even travelling alone. I struggle very much to answer the question of whether I love him or not but part of that could be due to a misrepresented definition I have of what love is. Despite that, we still do a lot of things together mostly because ""it's just the way it always has been"".

Things got even more complicated in the Fall when I started chatting with a guy at my gym who I've hit it off well with. We've gone out for coffee once and we were both astonished at how much we have in common: similar family conflicts, both dealing with a parent with dementia, and for those who care we happened to be the exact same psychological sign which includes sun, moon and rising - again take what you will from that. We also discovered we have similar challenges in day-to-day life with things such as work conflict resolution, and just generally shared some similar opinions. I don't know for sure how he feels towards me, there have been mixed signals and to be fair he is the one who approached me at the gym to say hey. At the same time, I can tell he is trying to protect him self by limiting how often he will reach out since he knows I'm in a relationship. I get butterflies thinking about him and I can easily envision doing things I don't have the desire to do with my partner such as being very affectionate with him including in public. I feel like the only way I can do this with my partner is if we almost reconstruct many aspects of our relationship from scratch but my struggle is the lack of motivation to do this.

My issue is I find myself in such a confusing situation now where it's hard to focus on one thing (the relationship) or the crush (intense infatuation, and obsessing over them reaching out to me). I'm worried it will cause confusion in my decision on how to handle the relationship. My mind is already viewing the crush as a form of salvation and reward I get to have if I leave the relationship - but this is insane because as much as I connect with this person, there is still so much I do not know about him and it's still possible we may not be a match.

My biggest worry is I end the relationship because of my silly but intense crush rather than because of core issues that I've deemed cannot be solved because we have grown apart too much (I have a therapist helping me with this bit and he is also aware of the crush).

What are some healthy methods to 1. deal with this impending feeling of limerence/obsession for this other guy who occupies my mind the whole day, and 2. ensure the former doesn't have any direct or indirect influence on the decision of how to proceed with the relationship?

My friends prank called me three times at 1am and really scared me.,"I have no plans to end our friendship over this. However, i‚Äôm a really paranoid person and it really left a sour taste in my mouth.

Last night around 12:40 i got a call from no caller ID. I didn‚Äôt answer, and got a voicemail from a girl saying i left her my phone number on a receipt in a local coffee shop and she wanted to be my friend. Very harmless except I‚Äôve only been to that coffee shop once years ago so i knew it wasn‚Äôt true. At first i thought it was a scam, but my area code doesn‚Äôt match the area i live in. I texted my gc of friends saying how odd it was. 

Then the no caller ID called again at 1am. I again didn‚Äôt pick up, and it was a second voicemail from the same girl saying reiterating the last message. At this point i‚Äôm a little freaked bc who in their right mind calls a stranger twice at 1am? I texted my gc of friends again telling them i was getting a little scared and they agreed it was creepy. 

Then i get a third call from no caller ID around 1:20am. This time the voice is obviously AI, a man‚Äôs voice saying they have a secret crush on me and have seen me walking around my town and love my hair and the way i laugh etc. (it also said he‚Äôs not a fan of how i walk lmao) I consume a lot of true crime and horror content so this point i‚Äôm thinking i either have a stalker or my phone number has been leaked somewhere. I texted my friends again saying i was really scared. I called my partner and told them how freaked out I was, and they agreed it‚Äôs really creepy and said they‚Äôd stay on the phone while i go to sleep. I really struggled to sleep bc i built up the scenarios in my head and was basically convinced someone would break into my house and k word me lol. 

When I up this morning my friend confessed in the gc that she and another friend of mine had been prank calling me last night and expected me to pick up at least one of the calls so they could explain. She said she didn‚Äôt understand how i couldn‚Äôt hear laughing in the background of the voicemails. I didn‚Äôt hear anything. She apologized very plainly over text, but she‚Äôs the type of person to not get anxious about anything so i really don‚Äôt think she understands how much it affected me. 

I‚Äôm frustrated she didn‚Äôt just text last night to tell me it was a prank because it really fucked up my night. She knew i was scared because i kept texting about it in the gc. Again I don‚Äôt plan to do anything about this and I understand she was just trying to have fun but I just need to know if my frustration is justified. In the light of day i feel silly for being so scared but i cried for an hour after she confessed. It just feels like they were making a joke out of my paranoia.

My partner is pissed on my behalf but they‚Äôre overprotective so i need an opinion that is unbiased. My other friends in the gc think it‚Äôs funny. Don‚Äôt get me wrong i totally think prank calls can be funny but it‚Äôs the fact that they dragged it out knowing i was scared and waited until the next morning to say anything that makes me upset.

1iar0hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1iar0hz/why_do_guys_feel_comfortable_to_shoot_their_shot/,Why do guys feel comfortable to shoot their shot over social media but not in person?,"So I (23F) have been struggling with this for a while. 

I‚Äòm not a big party girl so I basically just meet guys at work, college, the gym or through friends I already have. I also don‚Äòt use dating apps.

I am pretty extroverted myself and regularly start basic conversations with random people (like about an exercise at the gym, some random topic at work, stuff like that). I always seem to have great conversations with women and there have been a few friendships formed out of it. Older men (like 50+) are also great at conversing and it never seems awkward, I feel like they‚Äòre just happy to talk and share some wisdom about the topic in question.

However, what I have been noticing in general is that younger guys (like my age range up to 30/35) either don‚Äòt know how to communicate in person and/or are only comfortable flirting/shooting their shot via social media. 


What usually happens is one of the following:
- You get stared at but not talked to in person but then messaged on Instagram afterwards (asking for a date, giving compliments etc.) sometimes you don‚Äòt even know how they found your profile, had guys especially at the gym rather go through 5k followers on the gym account to find and message me rather than just starting a conversation in person
- You smalltalk to a guy in person, they are super perplexed and don‚Äòt seem very interested in a conversation but then message on Instagram afterwards to ask for a date
- You smalltalk to a guy, they seem nice/normal but not flirty at all but then message you after on Instagram to ask for a date

I can count the times I have been asked out in person on one hand and it always had a nice touch to it, one of those times turned into a serious relationship as well. It seems as though what I have described above is the new ‚Äönorm‚Äò of asking someone out. I get being shy and not wanting to push anything sraight away or being afraid of rejection, I really do. What I don‚Äòt get is people not being able to get out a straight sentence in person but then acting like they are the most confident alpha male to ever exist on instagram right afterwards.

Why is that? Why can‚Äòt they just have a few nice conversations and then suggest to maybe get a coffee sometime? If they are so scared of rejection, why is that the case only in person and not online? ",0,1737926959.0,dating_advice,14,0.45,False
1iar0g6,https://i.redd.it/e0eq33f4pefe1.jpeg,"PLM: Rewatch 2025, S3E8: Amoxicillin","Description: Josh agrees to visit Ben in hospital before his brain surgery, but keeps it a secret from Arnold. Tom discovers he has chlamydia and goes to ridiculous lengths to try and treat Ella without losing her.

Notes:
- Creepy Ben returns, now in the hospital on his possible death bed. I suppose why not shoot your shot but.. ugghhh. 

- ‚Äúhere we go!‚Äù Here WE go!‚Äù Heeere weeee goooo!‚Äù Tom popping up to instantly say he has chlamydia always has me laughing 

- Yay coffee cart 

- Again, the ability for them to run a whole storyline about Alan and Mae in the background who are now back to trying. Amazing. And more Josh/Mae time being adorable is always welcome. Love those crazy kids‚Ä¶ and Alan and Mae too

- Would chlamydia meds be effective if crushed up in good? Especially something with high acid content? I‚Äôve never drugged a person before so‚Ä¶

- How does Claire not immediately suggest Josh got worms from Ben? 

- How is Arnold the only one who thinks to google. And why does everyone else have a base knowledge about having worms?

- I feel Josh was premature with making up the story about worms 

- Rose and Hannah clearly not working out.

- It‚Äôs funny that Josh doesn‚Äôt want Arnold to realize he‚Äôs lying, only for Arnold to later feel bothered by the fact he lied to him. Wasn‚Äôt it Arnold last season who was asked if he was lying to Josh and said ‚Äúless and less‚Äù?

- For real, you could take the Rose scenes, run way different music underneath it, and it‚Äôs a horror film. Manic episodes, home full of dirty dishes and rotting food due to depression, and now an aggressive stalking mental ex

-  I‚Äôm with Ella, Tom should have gotten a little tr
eat.
 
- ‚ÄúThere are no worms, Tom has chlamydia‚Äù ‚Äúagain‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDoes he always lie? I thought he never lies, maybe that‚Äôs the biggest lie all along‚Äù

- Alan and Mae are funny. She laughingly turns down his proposal, they stay together. But then she admits she cheated when she was pregnant and prior to said proposal. Now Alan‚Äôs at a loss, but they stay together, then SHE breaks up with him- but then plans a special night to win him back‚Ä¶ which is odd because she broke up with him.

- ‚ÄúOnly the dead have seen the end of war- it‚Äôs a Plato quote‚Äù love that Ella moment.

- Alan freezing up when Stewart comes out, but Mae ready to battle.

- one dumb thing about the scene where Alan drives off with Stuart that I always hate. And you‚Äôd have to actually watch yourself. Is the music. Cuz they go to a standard clip from their repertoire, but it‚Äôs like a proud march. And I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ a mentally ill man threatening an ex being driven off on the hood of a car‚Ä¶ again, maybe not a fun lighthearted moment. Is it just me?

- Another bit of cognitive dissonance, the whole ‚Äúsex time!‚Äù With Ella and Tom. Because how fucked up is it that your gf resorts to breaking your shit for turning down sex? How does that not come off as coercion? Then she‚Äôs blas√© about the STI, until she‚Äôs reminded how much of a betrayal that was. ‚ÄúNow I have to get angry at you‚Ä¶as a way of respecting myself‚Äù

- ‚ÄúHey Josh, can you feel my possibly contagious vagina against your homosexual thigh?‚Äù

- Alright, this is a conflicting episode because I somehow love it (I love farces, see Frasier) but it‚Äôs also the most fucked up episode for all the above reasons. On one hand I appreciate an adult conversation about the matter and not treating a treatable sti like death, BUT it only came after lying about an sti and testing to have unprotected sex, not coming forward with your diagnosis, attempting to secretly drug your girlfriend, the conspiring with others to do so, then borderline abusive behaviour to coerce sex. Like maybe people SHOULD go to jail here. AM",3,1737926956.0,PleaseLikeMe,0,1.0,False
1iar07y,https://i.redd.it/hhjioqu2pefe1.jpeg,Messed up stain cure time for a tabletop. What to do next?,"I need advice on a piece I made that‚Äôs still off gassing more than I expected. I cut and stained a new top piece (and bottom shelf) to replace the original worn out particle board for this coffee table from a box store. After sanding it down I stained it with two coats of oil based Varathane (applying and then wiping off the excess). It then sat in my open air garage for 3 or 4 days in 40ish degree weather. After that it felt dry (enough) so I sprayed it with two coats of Zinder spray shellac and I brought it inside to install. I didn‚Äôt get around to doing that until today, another 2 or 3 weeks later. 

At first it seemed all good in the living room as we watched tv but after an hour or so my partner who is more sensitive to fumes and smells complained they could smell it still and it was giving them a headache. It‚Äôs back outside now but I‚Äôm wondering what I should do now to make sure it‚Äôs fully dried/cured/not hazardous to have indoors again. 

I now know what I should do next time: use a water based stain and/or wait 30 days for the stain to fully cure (in warmer conditions ideally). But is there anything I can/should do now to get this piece safe and usable? Will the shellac prevent it from ever fully curing? Could I apply some water based polycrylic to seal it more properly? Would a heater next to the wood outside help it cure faster? Thank you for any advice you can provide",1,1737926942.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,2,1.0,False

**Meteora:** *From the Inside: Linkin Park‚Äôs Meteora* (192-pages coffee table book), and the 40-page book from the 20th Anniversary Box Set

**Minutes to Midnight:** a 68-page art book from the Super Deluxe Tour Edition, and the booklet that came with the book-like Deluxe Edition, which also included a CD and DVD.

**A Thousand Suns:** A hardcover art book included with the Deluxe Fan Edition.

**THP:** I wasn‚Äôt sure if this should count, but I know there‚Äôs a CD Deluxe Edition that came with a 36-page art book featuring lyrics.

**OML:** I‚Äôm not sure if this even exists, but I found photos on Frank Maddocks‚Äô personal page that appear to be from an art book related to OML.

1iaqwt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1iaqwt0/egan_education/,Egan Education,"To start off, I don't currently homeschool. There are no schools in my area that I think are fantastic, though my younger children are enrolled in the local Steiner school. Below are my thoughts for a school that I would actually like to send my kids to. I was hoping to get feedback from those of you who are in the place of ""I wish there was a school for my kid"". I know that many of you would homeschool regardless of the schooling options. If this type of post is not allowed, please let me know and I'll delete it.   


In late 2023 I read Brandon Hendrickson‚Äôs book review of Kieran Egan‚Äôs book *The Educated Mind* on ACX. I‚Äôm a teacher and it lit a fire in me. I spent 2024 cycling with my young family and while I kept reading some Egan-related things, I didn‚Äôt really ‚Äúwork on it‚Äù. At some point in that year I decided to dedicate a bunch of 2025 time (around 20 hours a week) to understanding Egan‚Äôs ideas and determine what I should do with them.



I‚Äôm posting because I would like to get feedback on what people think about my school and my education ideas. To this end, I welcome any comments. Please be polite, but pull no punches. If you have any ideas of your own that you think should be included in any good school, let me know them too. If you‚Äôd like to leave feedback anonymously, use this [link](https://www.admonymous.co/chris_wintergreen).



**The problem:** I think of it as *soft edges*, which I mean as ‚Äúthere are things that you‚Äôre literally allowed to change about education, but because people (teachers, students, parents) are set in their ways, these changes happen in a small way at best, so progress is slow/nonexistent‚Äù. Which is to say that I don‚Äôt think anyone is doing anything wrong - teachers, school execs, students, parents, The Department, the curriculum folks.



**My solution:** tell people ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing a different thing over here so if you want to work/attend/send your spawn at/to this school, you‚Äôll do it this way‚Äù. This will snap them out of their local inadequate equilibrium and we can explore the landscape of educational possibilities a bit. At the end of the day I want more variety, ie. actual options for parents. Remember, this is just an idea, not something I want to be forcing upon every school, just an option for those who want it.



The differences to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù school:¬†

1. **Every lesson is Eganised.** Imaginative education is in the middle of everything. This doesn‚Äôt mean not having explicit instruction or anything like that. If you don‚Äôt know who Egan is, that‚Äôs no big deal.
2. **Subjects aren‚Äôt Maths/English/HASS/Science.** The world isn‚Äôt broken into those categories, so why would learning best be thought of that way? Thinking certainly isn‚Äôt. Instead we have fun things like Defence Against the Dark Arts (of manipulation, eg. sportsbetting, marketing), Reality Levels 1, 2, etc. (think like material science for things we interact with and physics/chem/bio come into it that way), Tool Use (think Conrad Wolfram‚Äôs maths curriculum that focuses less on the Calculate step of solving problems mathematically and more on the preceding Define and Abstract steps and the following Interpret step), Thinking (rationality, probably a bunch of stuff based on LW posts), Progress (Kinda progress studies, but also goes into the past, something something, grokking the arc of history and realising we‚Äôre living in it), Money (financial literacy), Food (with the goal of people having a healthy relationship with food and being able to easily cook at least 7 cheap, delicious, healthy meals that they personally enjoy). There will also be subjects like Math Appreciation (probably compulsory) and Math Theory for people that like and want to do maths. And yes, I do kinda think that going to school should feel like going to Hogwarts - if kids learnt how things actually work in the real world, it would basically feel like magic anyway!
3. **TECH!** LLMs are a crazy tool to have access to! Each kid will be taught to be good at using them. They will have a context document and train their own LLM on their interests, their way of understanding so that every explanation is tailored to them. Assessment might be they use Sonnet/4o/r1 to learn about a topic (1 hour) then have a 10 minute teacher/class discussion about it, teaching the ‚Äúteacher‚Äù (I like to think of us as ‚Äúfacilitators‚Äù). They will know how to make the LLM use Egan‚Äôs tools/Socratic Method to tell them stories and ask them (the student) questions to give them understanding, not information.
4. **There is (limited) self-directed inquiry (SDI).** This is less ‚Äústudy what you want‚Äù more ‚ÄúI will make you explore the world‚Äù. Super smart and wise kids I know have done free-for-all SDI (eg. Big Picture) and said it was mostly a waste of time because they couldn‚Äôt predict what they would be interested in even six months hence, let alone in a few years time. So for us, each project will be a term in duration. They will concurrently do things in a few categories:
   1. **Skill junkie:** you will end up with a box ticked on a report and maybe something on your resume after each of these. Think touch typing, make the perfect barista coffee, video editing, three-plate carry, quick sketching, spreadsheets.
   2. **What you want:** go deep on anything you want.¬†
   3. **Interesting part of a category.** Imagine a non-music person being forced to find the most interesting thing to them in music production and spending 30 hours working on it or a nerd doing woodwork. We make them do it because it‚Äôll be good for them to be broad, not because it‚Äôs necessarily what they would choose to do right now. We will spend time getting them on board with this plan by explaining it rather than holding a whip.¬†
   4. **Exploration:** I‚Äôm into spending 90% of learning time going deep and 10% exploring, so they must explore.
5. **‚ÄúAfter school program‚Äù.** The idea here is that from an early finish time (between 2pm and 2:30pm) until about 5pm there are things to do at school. At the start of that time they‚Äôd tend to be more organised and towards the end they‚Äôd be more ‚Äúhang out‚Äù. This is not school because I want this to be a relatively independent time for the kids, kind of like forcing them to hang out in person rather than be on their phones the whole time. Also, it means parents can work a full day. Also, I don‚Äôt know how this fits with school buses - maybe cheaper because it‚Äôs off peak times, probably more expensive because it‚Äôs later and nobody else is doing it then.¬†
6. **Mentorship.** I haven‚Äôt thought about this one a lot yet because I know there are hundreds of successful mentorship programs in the world and I figure I can learn from them. I think everyone has and is a student mentor and the oldest kids have an external mentor, but we‚Äôll see how it plays out.
7. **PE** isn‚Äôt about *learning sports,* it‚Äôs about learning how your body works, being in the right zone throughout the school day and having good habits when you leave school (eg. actually enjoying sport and therefore playing it, playing with friends, etc.)
8. **The kids coming out are functional humans.** For example, they should all be able to cook at least seven cheap, healthy, delicious meals. They have money skills. When they need to apply for a job/business number/university course they know how to use a language model to optimise that process and will five minute rule/more dakka until things get done. They will have *good habits*. (This is the goal anyway, shit will hit the fan as soon as kids get involved, it always does).



Let me know what you think about any of these ideas that you like/dislike. If you don‚Äôt think the world needs another school, you can let me know that too, but please be polite: I‚Äôm a human too.¬†

1iaqseg,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1iaqseg/waiting/,Waiting,"I‚Äôm waiting for you

Hey C. I think about you day and night. Our last conversation we had felt like I had so much more to say and I hate how angry I was and I hate that we stopped communicating. I know we both said we‚Äôve give each other space to figure everything out but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever changed my mind. It‚Äôs you, it‚Äôs always been you. I love you more than you‚Äôll ever know and I hope that the universe brings us together again the right way. 

How are you doing? Are you thinking about me the way I think about you? Do you still feel the same way about me? Do you still want an us? I told you I need to let you go and in hopes that you‚Äôll return to me, that you‚Äôll come for me. I try to tell myself everyday that you won‚Äôt, that I need to get over you and live my life but it‚Äôs so damn hard. A small part of me dreams and hopes that you‚Äôll show up at my door. You‚Äôre no longer blocked, I think because I hope that you‚Äôll message me and spill it all. I check my messages and social media everyday hoping, praying for a message from you telling me you‚Äôre going to give us a chance. I know it would be hard for the both of us but it would be so worth it. If going through the trenches would lead me to you, I‚Äôd do it over and over again. 

I listen to your music every single day. I know what we had was real, I love you for who you are and not what you can give or provide or your potential. I‚Äôve never felt so safe and accepted by someone. I wish I had known the last time I got to be near you, kiss you, touch you, was the last I would‚Äôve made the best of it. I hope you do open your coffee business and find your happiness even if it‚Äôs not with me and I‚Äôve always meant that. I love you so much, you always wondered how I could and I never understood how you couldn‚Äôt see it. I know I always teased you, but I had nothing but love for you. I want to crawl and live in your skin is how in love with you I am and I‚Äôve never felt or have said that to anyone but you. You are home, you are warmth, you are my happiness. 

I visit our coffee shop any chance I get and sit there and think about us and how maybe one day we‚Äôll have coffee again, wondering why it took us so long to be together. I still think about the trips we planned, about going to the beach together. About you seeing my favorite artist with me even though you don‚Äôt understand them. I bought tickets to their concert that is 7 months from now and dear god I wanted to message you and tell you so badly. I bought your birthday present before we ended things so abruptly and I‚Äôve thought about dropping it off at your office when you‚Äôre not there. I‚Äôve also thought about holding onto it because I know we‚Äôll be together again or maybe it‚Äôs just hope. I hope you still have the cologne I bought for you. I hope you still have the coaster I made for you.  

I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll ever be together, I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll ever be an us or if I‚Äôll ever hear from you again. Every time I hear or see your name being said by someone else my heart flutters. I want you to know I‚Äôm always thinking about you, I want the best for you. I want you to be happy. To see how much you deserve happiness and everything you want in life. Even though I said I wouldn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm waiting for you. I hope you see this. I hope you reach out. For now I‚Äôm letting the universe, the god(s), fate, whomever decide. Te amo, mi amor. ",1,1737926459.0,letters,1,1.0,False

1iaqlkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/trypanophobia/comments/1iaqlkm/my_routine_for_getting_through_a_blood_draw/,My routine for getting through a blood draw,"Just got through another one successfully. I faint every time I get a blood draw, vaccine, or any injection. Unfortunately I have a chronic illness that requires regular blood draws, so here are the things I've done over the years to get through it:

* In the weeks leading up to the blood draw, do exposure therapy. I did this with the guidance of my therapist and it significantly improved my fear. First I start looking at pictures of blood draw needles until looking at them no longer makes me scared, then I start looking at pictures of people getting blood draws until it no longer phases me, then I look at phlebotomy instructional videos on YouTube that show people getting the shot until I get bored of it. I watch the videos like 30x each and it helps blunt that anxiety reaction because you start to associate needles with making you bored. 
* Drink a ton of water the entire week beforehand. No alcohol. Minimal coffee. And no coffee the day you go in. I have bad tiny veins so this one is important for me. It's the only way to get your veins juicy so they don't miss. Pee should be almost clear when you go in.
* I take .25mg Klonopin the morning of to make me less stressed going in. I'm small so that's what I need to be chill but not drowsy, you may need more, ymmv.
* At least an hour before the draw, I put 4% CVS brand lidocaine on the area where they'll be taking it (I only have one vein that can be accessed easily, so I always tell them to use that one) and I cover it with gauze. The numbing effect helps me significantly because I can't feel the needle going in. 
* On the way there, I drink more water. I have a giant water bottle. I also stuff my pockets with hi-chews. 
* Chug two cups of water immediately before they take the blood. This is a tip I read about in a paper on vasovagal syncope -- chugging two cups of water can be enough to stop the vasovagal response in many people. 
* I ask them to let me lie down. If you're lying down, you won't faint.
* I tell the nurse openly that I faint every time I have my blood drawn. It's better to tell them so they can be gentle with you, lol. 
* While they perform the procedure, do not look. And do not look at the vials of blood afterward. Just keep staring at the wall. I still feel some pressure despite the lidocaine during the procedure. I try to sing a song in my head for the minute it takes them to do it. Or I go over my to-do list for the rest of the day. Something boring. Sometimes I'll try to chat the nurse up about their day. 
* While they perform the procedure, there are muscle exercises you can do to prevent yourself from feinting. Anything isometric that raises your blood pressure, right when the needle goes in. Look up Applied Tension Technique, that one works best for me. Another tip I read about in a paper is squeezing an extremely hard round object with your right hand. 
* After they finish, I ask them if I can keep lying down for 5-10 minutes. I usually still feel somewhat faint and lightheaded, so this helps me. 
* After those initial 5-10 minutes, I usually end up sitting down in the lobby for another 15 minutes or so until I feel stable enough to walk. ",4,1737926039.0,trypanophobia,0,1.0,False

As the title suggests, I am looking into how to modify my ""Popper is a coffee Roaster"" from Sweet Maria's to work with Artisan and control roasts digitally. I'm a bit of a nerd so the data collection and being able to setup a curve is really intriguing to me/

I have seen a ton of tutorials to do the same with a basic popper, but not one specifically for my popper. Frankly the name of the thing makes it pretty hard to search lol

I'm thinking it may be a bit simpler given that the electronics are already in the device to control heat/fan speed. I'm guessing I might need some of the same components but can likely skip some things like the external power supply.

Ideally I could get a circuit diagram of the roaster, to know better how to mod it, but guessing that the Fan Speed could be controlled by Relays or MOSFET (depending on AC or DC) and possibly a DPOT for the temperature control.

Of course this is all a bit speculative since I don't have the circuit diagram. I'll tear it open next to take a look inside. At the absolute minimum I'll add a thermocouple and maybe can figure out a way to manually follow a roast curve...

Any thoughts? or should I just sell this thing and get something different?",1,1737926011.0,roasting,0,1.0,False
1iaql1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iaql1c/sf_the_watchers/,[SF] The Watchers,"Chapter 1: Ordinary Days

The morning began like any other. Elliot woke to the hum of his phone vibrating on the nightstand, the alarm‚Äôs soft chime persistent but noninvasive‚Äîjust the way he liked it. He stared at the ceiling for a moment, letting the soft light of dawn creep in through the cracks of the blinds.

He brewed coffee, black, no sugar, and flipped through a few emails on his tablet. Spam. Promotions. A reminder about the staff meeting scheduled for 2 PM. The mundane threads of routine. Outside, the world stirred as it always did: garbage trucks groaned down the street, car engines revved, and the distant laughter of children heading to school floated in through the open window. It was the sound of life moving forward, oblivious to anything beyond the here and now.

By 9 AM, Elliot was in his car, navigating the usual morning traffic. A news anchor‚Äôs voice crackled through the radio, recounting the latest political drama and an unusually high number of flight cancellations across the country. The anchor shifted to a story about a heatwave breaking records in Europe. He turned the volume down, preferring the silence of his own thoughts.

At 10:42 AM, the first siren blared.

Elliot was sitting in his small office at the community college, grading essays on dystopian literature. The siren came without warning, a low, mournful wail that reverberated through the building. It wasn‚Äôt the familiar fire alarm; this sound carried weight, an urgency that made him freeze mid-sentence.

He stood, instinctively walking toward the window. Outside, students and faculty had stopped in their tracks, craning their necks toward the sky. For a moment, there was no visible reason for the siren, no smoke, no planes overhead‚Äîjust an eerie stillness. Then the second siren began, louder and deeper, like the earth itself was groaning in protest.

The first explosion shattered the calm.

Elliot flinched as a deafening roar tore through the air. He whipped his head toward the source of the sound, a plume of smoke rising from somewhere near the city center. Another explosion followed moments later, farther away but no less violent. A flicker of motion caught his eye‚Äîa plane, a commercial airliner, spiraling downward in a fiery descent.

It hit the ground miles away, but the shockwave was strong enough to rattle the windows.

Panic erupted. Students screamed, some running toward the parking lot, others crouching low as if the ground might protect them. Elliot grabbed his bag and followed the surge of bodies pouring into the hallway.

The air outside was thick with tension, the smell of smoke faint but growing stronger. Elliot‚Äôs phone buzzed incessantly with emergency alerts. National Emergency Declared. Stay Indoors. Do Not Engage with Unknown Phenomena.

He scanned the crowd, searching for a familiar face, but the sea of panic-stricken strangers offered no comfort. That was when he saw the lights.

Thin streaks of glowing energy danced across the sky like searchlights, their movements impossibly smooth and deliberate. They weren‚Äôt planes or drones; they were something else entirely. Something alive.

Elliot watched, transfixed, as one of the lights hovered above the crowd. It shimmered faintly, its glow intensifying, and then shot downward. The light struck a man standing a few feet away, piercing him like a bolt of lightning. The man froze mid-scream, his body rigid, as a ripple of energy passed through him.

And then, he was gone.

There was no body, no ash‚Äîjust a pile of fine black dust where he had stood moments before. In the center of the dust, a sapling sprouted, its delicate leaves unfurling as if to greet the chaos around it.

Elliot stumbled backward, his breath catching in his throat. Around him, people screamed and scattered, their terror mirrored in the haunting silence of the Watchers above.

Chapter 2: Fractured Silence

The night passed in tense, fitful silence. Elliot lay on his couch, unable to bring himself to sleep upstairs, his eyes fixed on the faintly glowing orb that hovered by the living room door. Every so often, it pulsed, as though adjusting itself, and Elliot would feel his heart stutter in response. Each pulse carried the same unspoken threat: I‚Äôm here, and I am waiting.

But waiting for what?

The Watchers weren‚Äôt human, that much was obvious. They didn‚Äôt have faces or bodies, only a faint glow that hinted at some kind of sentience‚Äîor perhaps something far removed from what humans would call intelligence. Elliot found himself wondering if the Watchers even noticed the people they hovered over. Were they observing, calculating, deciding? Or were they simply following some primal instinct, as thoughtless and mechanical as bacteria multiplying in a petri dish?

And if they were intelligent, what did that mean for the people they chose to take? Did the Watchers know something humans didn‚Äôt? Did they see some flaw, some unspoken limit in humanity‚Äôs nature that made this reset necessary? Or were they simply playing out a script, one written long before the first human opened its eyes to the world?

Elliot tried to shake the thoughts from his mind, but they lingered, heavy and insistent. What did it mean to be human, anyway? If a person could simply be reduced to dust and replaced by a plant, was their existence ever more than the sum of their biology? And if their essence truly remained in the saplings‚Äîas some people had begun to whisper‚Äîwas that enough to call it life? Or was it something else entirely?

Chapter 3: The New Silence

The city grew quieter with each passing day.

Elliot ventured outside sparingly, driven less by curiosity and more by the need to see if anyone else was still alive. Most of his neighbors had vanished. Their houses stood dark and silent, doors left ajar, cars still parked in their driveways. Where he once might have seen families unloading groceries or children playing in the yard, there were now only saplings, their delicate branches swaying in an unfelt breeze.

He passed one house where a sapling grew tall and straight in the middle of a driveway. Its leaves shimmered faintly in the sunlight, their edges tinged with an unnatural green. He paused, staring at it. The thought struck him unbidden: What if that was me? What if someday soon, someone else would walk past his house and see a sapling growing where he had once stood? Would they wonder who he had been? Or would they simply keep walking, unaware that anything had been lost?

As the days stretched into a week, Elliot found himself growing obsessed with the saplings. He couldn‚Äôt help but touch their leaves, feeling the strange warmth that radiated from them. At first, he dismissed it as a trick of his imagination, but the more he touched them, the more he was convinced: the saplings weren‚Äôt just alive. They were aware.

And that awareness terrified him.

Chapter 4: Patterns in the Chaos

Malcolm was the first person Elliot had spoken to in days.

They met on the edge of the neighborhood, Malcolm standing in the middle of the street and staring at a particularly large sapling. He turned as Elliot approached, his face lined with exhaustion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been watching them,‚Äù he said without preamble. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not random.‚Äù

Elliot frowned. ‚ÄúThe Watchers?‚Äù

Malcolm shook his head. ‚ÄúThe saplings. Look.‚Äù He gestured to a map he had spread out on the hood of a car. It was marked with dozens of red dots, each one representing a sapling. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre forming a pattern. A grid.‚Äù

Elliot leaned over the map, his stomach sinking. The pattern was undeniable. The saplings weren‚Äôt growing haphazardly. They were part of something larger, something deliberate.

‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù Elliot asked. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù

Malcolm didn‚Äôt answer right away. Instead, he stared at the map, his fingers tracing the lines between the dots. Finally, he said, ‚ÄúWhat if we‚Äôre not the ones asking the question? What if we‚Äôre the answer?‚Äù

Elliot stared at him, confused. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Malcolm looked up, his eyes dark and serious. ‚ÄúThink about it. Every species on this planet exists for a reason. Bees pollinate flowers. Wolves cull the weak. Even the bacteria in our guts keep us alive. But humans? What do we do? What purpose do we serve?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe think. We create. We‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDo we?‚Äù Malcolm interrupted. ‚ÄúOr do we just take? Maybe the Watchers are here to fix that. Maybe they‚Äôre repurposing us. Turning us into something that actually matters.‚Äù

Elliot didn‚Äôt respond. He couldn‚Äôt. Because deep down, he knew Malcolm might be right.

Chapter 5: The Network

The saplings grew faster than anyone could have predicted. By the end of the second week, they were no longer just saplings‚Äîthey were trees. Their branches stretched high into the sky, their leaves shimmering with an unnatural light. And as they grew, the hum in the air grew louder.

Elliot began to notice it more and more. It wasn‚Äôt just a sound; it was a presence, a vibration that seemed to resonate in his bones. He couldn‚Äôt explain it, but he felt certain the saplings were communicating‚Äînot just with each other, but with the Watchers.

One night, unable to sleep, he ventured out to the largest tree in the neighborhood. It stood in the center of a park, its trunk wide enough to wrap his arms around. He placed his hand on the bark, and the hum grew louder, more insistent. And then, for the briefest moment, he felt something.

A whisper. A thought. A memory.

It wasn‚Äôt his own.

Chapter 6: Becoming

Elliot and Malcolm spent days trying to decipher the saplings‚Äô purpose. They mapped their growth, recorded their hums, and even attempted to measure the strange warmth that radiated from their trunks. But the more they learned, the less they understood.

And then, one evening, it all became clear.

The Watchers began to leave.

One by one, they vanished, their glowing forms fading into the night. Elliot‚Äôs watcher lingered longer than most, its light dimming but never disappearing. He wondered if it was waiting for him to make a choice.

In the end, he made it willingly. He walked to the massive tree in the park, placed his hand on its trunk, and closed his eyes. The light consumed him, and for a moment, he felt himself dissolving, his body unraveling into particles of energy. But he wasn‚Äôt afraid. He was at peace.

Epilogue: The Answer

The world was quiet now, its cities overtaken by forests of glowing trees. The air was clean, the skies clear. The Watchers were gone, their task complete. And in the whispers of the wind, the voices of humanity could still be heard, telling their stories to the Earth they had become.

1iaqidn,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1iaqidn/why_driving_an_ice_car_feels_like_using_a_flip/,Why Driving an ICE Car Feels Like Using a Flip Phone in 2025,"Well my friends, I wrote this at 2am after having some drinks with our parent friends that hate EV‚Äôs. Their arguments really bothered me and galvanized me to write this. Our kids did a sleepover at their house so I was freed up to write this ü§£üëäü´∂

If you‚Äôve ever driven an EV, you know this isn‚Äôt a debate anymore. EVs are better than ICE vehicles‚Äîfull stop. That‚Äôs not some marketing pitch or feel-good sentiment; it‚Äôs a conclusion rooted in hard facts, lived experience, and real-world practicality. I‚Äôm not writing this to convince anyone here‚Äîwe‚Äôre all enthusiasts who know what‚Äôs up‚Äîbut to hammer home just how rock-solid the case for EVs really is, no matter what angle you approach it from. Efficiency, cost, driving experience, reliability‚Äîit‚Äôs not just that EVs win on these fronts; it‚Äôs that ICE vehicles don‚Äôt even come close. And no, this has nothing to do with politics or climate change. This is about why EVs make sense in every way that matters. Period.

Let‚Äôs start with the foundation of why cars exist: moving people efficiently. The internal combustion engine was an incredible innovation for its time, but it‚Äôs inherently inefficient. A gas-powered engine converts about 20-30% of its energy into motion. The rest? Lost as heat, noise, and vibration. Think about that: every time you fill up at the pump, the majority of that energy is just being thrown away. An EV, on the other hand, operates at around 85-90% efficiency. That‚Äôs not a small improvement; that‚Äôs a complete reimagining of how energy gets translated into motion. It‚Äôs the difference between using a laser to cut steel versus a blunt axe. One is precise, effective, and purposeful. The other is crude, wasteful, and outdated.

And that efficiency isn‚Äôt just theoretical; it‚Äôs something you feel the first time you drive an EV. The instant torque, the seamless acceleration, the sense that the car is responding directly to you without hesitation‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt marketing hype. It‚Äôs physics. An ICE car has to spool up RPMs, shift gears, and work its way through a hundred mechanical processes just to give you forward motion. An EV? It just goes. Whether you‚Äôre merging onto a highway, passing a semi, or just enjoying a quiet backroad, an EV delivers power exactly when you need it, without delay, without drama, and without waste.

Of course, skeptics like to talk about range and charging as if they‚Äôre these insurmountable barriers. But let‚Äôs get real. Charging at home fundamentally changes the way you interact with your vehicle. You‚Äôre not stopping at gas stations anymore‚Äîyou‚Äôre starting every day with a full ‚Äútank.‚Äù For most people, that‚Äôs 90% of their driving covered without a second thought. And on the road? Fast charging is already here, and it‚Äôs only getting better. Yes, it takes longer than filling up with gas, but let‚Äôs put that in perspective: how often are you driving 300+ miles in one shot without a break? Most fast chargers can add significant range in the time it takes to grab a coffee or stretch your legs. And while you‚Äôre stretching, consider this: the infrastructure for EVs is improving at a rapid pace, while gas stations are a static, declining relic of the past. The trajectory here isn‚Äôt hard to see.

Then there‚Äôs the ‚Äúreliability‚Äù argument, which, frankly, has become laughable. ICE vehicles are incredibly complex machines with hundreds of moving parts‚Äîall of which can fail. Pistons, timing belts, crankshafts, transmissions‚Äîthe list goes on. An EV doesn‚Äôt need any of that. No oil changes. No spark plugs. No exhaust system. No transmission to fail. Fewer parts mean fewer points of failure, and fewer points of failure mean fewer repair bills. Even the brakes last longer thanks to regenerative braking, which also adds efficiency to every stop. EVs are simpler, and simplicity wins every time when it comes to reliability.

But let‚Äôs not just talk about what doesn‚Äôt break‚Äîlet‚Äôs talk about what improves. An EV doesn‚Äôt stay static the day you buy it. Over-the-air updates allow your car to get smarter, faster, and even more efficient over time. One day you wake up, and your range has increased. Or your car has new features you didn‚Äôt even know you wanted. This is something ICE vehicles will never, ever offer. Once you drive off the lot with a gas car, that‚Äôs it‚Äîit‚Äôs downhill from there. With an EV, it‚Äôs the opposite. You‚Äôre driving a car that evolves with you.

Cost is another favorite sticking point for skeptics, and it‚Äôs another area where EVs crush ICE vehicles. Sure, the upfront cost can be higher in some cases, but let‚Äôs talk total cost of ownership. No oil changes. Minimal maintenance. No gas bills. And battery longevity? Modern EV batteries are engineered to last far beyond what most people expect‚Äîoften outlasting the vehicle itself. Warranty coverage for EV batteries typically stretches 8-10 years or 100,000+ miles, and real-world data shows minimal degradation even after that. Add in the fact that electricity is cheaper and more stable in price than gasoline, and the financial argument tilts heavily in favor of EVs. It‚Äôs not just cheaper to own‚Äîit‚Äôs smarter to own.

And let‚Äôs not ignore the elephant in the room: driving an ICE vehicle feels old. Nostalgia only gets you so far. That ‚Äúengine growl‚Äù some people cling to? It‚Äôs just noise once you‚Äôve experienced the serene, almost meditative quiet of an EV. That constant vibration and clunkiness of gears shifting in a gas car? It feels clunky and archaic when you‚Äôre used to the smooth, effortless operation of an EV. I get it‚Äîsome people love their traditions. But clinging to tradition at the expense of progress has never been a good argument for anything.

For anyone worried about road trips, towing, or edge cases, let‚Äôs be honest: we‚Äôre not there yet for 100% of drivers. But for 99% of use cases, EVs are already more practical, more reliable, and more enjoyable. The outliers‚Äîpeople towing heavy loads in remote areas‚Äîwill have their solutions as technology continues to improve. It‚Äôs not a matter of if; it‚Äôs when. And in the meantime, EVs dominate every other aspect of daily driving.

So no, this isn‚Äôt a pitch to anyone here. You already know this. You‚Äôve felt it. You‚Äôve seen how EVs make ICE vehicles feel like relics of a less efficient, less thoughtful era. We don‚Äôt need to convince ourselves of this, but we should recognize just how inevitable this transition is. ICE vehicles aren‚Äôt being ‚Äúphased out‚Äù because someone decided they should be. They‚Äôre fading because they can‚Äôt keep up. EVs aren‚Äôt the future‚Äîthey‚Äôre the present, and every drive is a reminder of just how much better the present has become. The longer people cling to gas engines, the longer they‚Äôre denying themselves something better. And honestly, once they make the leap, they‚Äôll wonder why they waited so long.

1iaqep2,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1iaqep2/roommate_is_the_reason_i_dislike_dogs_now/,Roommate is the reason I dislike dogs now.,"Backstory TLDR; roommate came home with a large-breed high-energy puppy, no heads-up, never owned a dog and doesn't know wtf they're doing, has been expecting me to ""help"" care for it while also ignoring advice or requests on dog training and not paying me for 2 years now. Dog has turned into a menace, and they view me as a free caretaker and trainer. Any training I do gets reversed because they instigate and praise bad behavior. 

My family owned and trained dogs my entire life. I have a lot of experience, over 20 years worth. My roommate has 0 experience, but doesn't listen to me at all.

The dog is large, loud, highly-reactive, and goes ballistic over every little noise or movement. I tell them they need to train it, they don't and instead praise it for ""guarding the house."" The dog is scared of everything to the point it snaps, tried to attack my mom and tried to kill my cat, they don't socialize it. The dog has so much pent up energy it nuisance barks and acts crazy, they don't play with or exercise it. The dog shits in the house because it's in the negatives outside and they don't let it out enough, they don't get it a sweater and they still don't let it out enough. And they blame me for the accidents inside.

When I'm not at work, I'm at home, I don't have any hobbies that take me out of the house. Since I'm home a lot, they expect me to care for the dog, for free, even when they're home. I'm currently typing this out because I've been up since 10am, the dog has been begging at their bedroom door to go out since before I got up, it is now currently 3pm and they're just now taking it out. I'd have taken it out, but whenever I do something it becomes an expectation, again without compensation. 

Roommate keeps saying for the last 2 years ""thanks for helping with the dog, I promise I'll pay you for it."" But when I asked for $50 to be knocked off rent a few months ago they said no, literally last night I asked them to grab me a $5 coffee on their way home and they made me pay them even though I was actively caring for their dog. I've been caring for the dog for free for the 2 years since they brought it home and haven't been compensated a penny for it. 

I don't even like dogs that much, especially this one because of it's owners, but I feel bad ignoring the dog and it's not the dog's fault they're like this. This morning was rough because I heard her crying at their door for 5 hours, but we got into an argument recently where they said the dog going potty inside was my fault for not taking it out enough, and I told them the dog is not my responsibility especially when they are home. They can get up off their ass and take their own dog out instead of staying in bed and ignoring it and then blaming me. 

On top of all of this, the dog going crazy at night and them not doing anything about it even when they're in the same room, wakes me up every. single. night. I already struggle with falling and staying asleep, and the dog makes it nearly impossible.

	1.	Can handle traditional Italian-style espresso with smaller doses.
	2.	Has reliable steam capability, as I‚Äôd like to steam milk for cappuccinos and lattes occasionally.

I know specialty coffee often leans towards larger doses and lighter roasts, but I‚Äôm focused on replicating the rich, bold, classic flavor I‚Äôm used to.

I watched some guides from youtube, geared up and used Edgeville lever to get to Wilderness, and started hunting.

It was pretty exciting, my hands were literally shaking since pulling the lever. It was peak hours, and I was running through all the activity hotspots. 45 minutes. Nothing. I didn't see a single player during whole time. I stopped to kill a couple of Chaos Elementals to help with my building frustration. Then back to searching.

As I ran past Mage Arena bank towards west, I was ready to give up for the day, but then I saw it. Competition. Some other PKer was flexing with his Graceful set near the pirates hideout at level 52 wilderness. I thought that guy had to be good, I mean, who in his right mind would go to wilderness with his graceful set? Even though he was safeing a bit, being pretty close to the mage arena bank, I knew instantly that I was up for a good challenge with a real experienced PKer.

I was hit by a total panic attack. My hands were shaking when I pulled the lever? Well, now I was almost trembling in stress and panic. It was chaotic. I was trying to use the f-keys to quickly switch to prayer tab, to turn on the prayers, but instead I accidently pressed f1 and opened the equipment tab. I also pushed my full 0,7l coffee mug that spilled all over the keyboard, ""Sh*t!!!"" I screamed. Keyboard was instantly out of order. I was hanging in there only with my mouse left to fight.

The guy was just standing there with his amulet of ghostspeak. I have watched enough movies to know, that soon was going to happen. Like they say, it's always silence before the storm. I needed to collect myself back together, before he would 1-hit me with all of his spec gear, that he was going to 1-tick swap at the strategically right moment. 

I tried to switch to my dragon claws to drop a spec on him, but because my hands were shaking so much, I accidently switched to ancient staff. And I attacked him. Smack. Of course I didn't have autocast on. I was hitting the guy with the staff while wearing my black dhides. I moved the cursor back to my inventory, but I kept clicking on my sharks and potions, like omg give me a break! I grab my right hand that controls the mouse with my left hand and. Very. Carefully. Move. The. Cursor. On. The. Claws. 

Click.

I got the claws on! Great! I 2-handedly move the cursor on the attack style tab, ready to spec the guy right back to lumby! Finally! 

Here we go now.

My chair falls under me, while I stand up in excitement. I move the cursor. It's on spec bar. I click it. Nothing.

...


Nothing happens. Nothing happens...?? I move my eyes from the spec bar at the attack type tab to the game screen. My character stands next to a pile of bones while my spec bar is still loaded and ready at 100%.

Did I beat the guy? Can he teleport somehow and still leave bones behind? I was so stressed out that I forgot to check the chat, before I quickly logged out. I guess I just got my first PK kc? Yeah... I'm pretty sure that I just got my first PK kc!

I opened the window of my bedroom and yelled out of the window as loud as possible. Then I got on my bicycle and cycled as fast as possible to my friends house next door, and asked to use his computer to post this tribute of my first PK kc.

This is the beginning of a new chapter on my OSRS journey. The story of one of the most dangerous PKers ever lived is about to be born.

Cheers.

P.S. Oh, and I almost forgot - what a noob that guy was, I mean, who goes flexing in wildy with full graceful set if you can't even win everybody? I hope his wife atleast shames him a bit, if he has one, while he goes back to running the laps for another graceful.

Originally from Quebec City they moved there back in 2018. I visited Montreal some years back to see them and by the second night I almost cried because I had to leave in the coming days. I had went to Toronto before then and it couldn't compare to the beauty of Montreal. It reminded me of my hometown (which I don't live anymore) and there were so many similarities. 

The food, people, architecture, and climate were what made me fall in love with it. The pizza in Montreal isn't better than what I have in my hometown but it's damn near close. The apartments with the swirling stairs and balconies caught my eye most of all. Toronto had similar architecture to my hometown but Montreal had a more unique style. The city feels so cozy and welcoming to people like me. I went in November so there was fall foliage all around and it clashed wonderfully with the buildings. 

The parks and public spaces were nice and relaxing, people were actually enjoying themselves in the parks, people from all walks of life. In America, sometimes parks can be sketchy, unless you're in central park in NYC but even then there's exceptions. My friend wanted to walk to the store at like 2 am and I thought it was a little weird but they assured me it was safe. Where I'm from that's a no-no. I felt safe most places we went there. I even met someone and got a little more friendly with them until I had to leave. 

One day I told my friend I wanted to explore on my own and I ended up taking the metro across town and got a bagel at this restaurant I saw online and a coffee. In that moment I wanted to give up my life in America and stay there. Thinking of it now makes me want to cry because I wish I could afford to just pack up everything and move there. I wish I could snap my fingers and have a new life there. I wish I could be well established there and have a social circle who I could just be me with.

Tldr - A 50% Tariff Would Barely Affect the USA  but Devastate the Columbian economy. 

Impact on Colombia:

	‚Ä¢	A tariff this high would make Colombian goods too expensive, effectively cutting them off from their largest market.

	‚Ä¢	Key industries like agriculture and textiles would collapse, causing mass unemployment and driving millions into poverty.
	
‚Ä¢	The resulting economic shock could push Colombia into a deep recession and trigger widespread political instability.

Impact on the U.S.:

	‚Ä¢	The economic impact would be minimal. Colombian goods account for less than 1% of total imports, so replacing them wouldn‚Äôt be a challenge.

	‚Ä¢	Prices for items like coffee or bananas might rise slightly, but other suppliers like Brazil or Ecuador could fill the gap with ease.

The trade relationship between us :

	‚Ä¢	About 30-40% of Colombia‚Äôs exports go to the U.S., making us their largest trading partner.

	‚Ä¢	Industries like coffee, flowers and crude oil rely almost entirely on American demand to stay afloat.

	‚Ä¢	Without access to the U.S. market, they lack viable alternatives, which would leave their economy in shambles.

	‚Ä¢	Colombia represents less than 1% of total U.S. imports, making their contribution to our economy negligible.

The coffee is pricier than typical Taipei cafe prices; I went with their flight which included a pastry. I think it ran me about 1200 NTD which is about 36 USD.

We‚Äôre experienced hikers who have completed the Catskills 3500 in summer and other treks like Everest Base Camp and Colorado 14ers. However, we‚Äôre not experienced winter hikers. We‚Äôve used microspikes and snowshoes a handful of times, but none of those were in the Catskills during winter.

As we think about winter hiking in the Catskills, some mountains‚Äîespecially on The Devil‚Äôs Path (looking at you, Twin Mountain)‚Äîcome to mind with scrambles and sections where slipping or falling would be a big concern. For our first winter hike, we‚Äôre looking for something more moderate, where we can build confidence and gain experience safely.

We‚Äôve got the essentials: proper layering (down, synthetic, shell, wool), boots, microspikes, snowshoes, poles with baskets, emergency bivvy sack, Jetboil (gotta have that trail coffee!), first aid, a Garmin inReach, two iPhones with Gaia maps downloaded, paper maps, and more. But as we know, gear isn‚Äôt a substitute for experience, so we want to start cautiously.

Does anyone have recommendations for a good beginner winter hike in the Catskills? We‚Äôre thinking of something like Windham High Peak. A summit with a view would be a bonus, but it‚Äôs not essential. We‚Äôre also fine with turning around if the conditions get challenging‚Äîwe want to treat this as a learning experience.

1iaq3jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/intoxalock/comments/1iaq3jq/intoxalock_how_to_survive_intoxalock/,Intoxalock: how to survive Intoxalock,"I got my 3rd Dwi back in October of 2023 and here are tips to survive Intoxalock for people who are struggling. First I live in the state of MN so when you originally get Intoxalock call them and let them know you live in a cold state I‚Äôm not sure which states allow this but Minnesota does you are able to unscrew the head unit. The thing you blow into and bring it inside this will save you in the winter from the device freezing because if it freezes you are going to have a very bad day. Make sure before you disconnect the unit you hold the center button until it goes into power saving mode. It will display that on the screen. DO NO DISCONNECT THE DEVICE DURING A COUNTDOWN. This will result in a violation and a lockout 75$ fee and possible extension on how long you have to have this. In my case 3 Years. Tip number 2 this is the expensive part you are going to have to Invest in a trickle charger especially for those cold days which in Minnesota is damn near 8 months out of the year. The device will kill your battery even if you drive daily I recommend getting a main battery and a secondary battery that you keep on the charger just incase. Third tip if you have a cancellation IPS license and you decide to go out drinking DO NOT BLOW INTO YOUR DEVICE FOR ATLEAST 24hrs!‚Ä¶.If you do and you fail it will be an automatic cancellation of your drivers license and you will have to restart the program all over meaning if you had 1 week left on a 3yr sentence and you fail guess what now you restart the program over this is where people get confused this is only for people who have a cancellation on their drivers license. revoked and cancellation are two very different things. On a revoked license if you fail a breath test you will receive an additional 180 days and it will double for every fail I recommend not drinking at all but I‚Äôm in recovery and I know how it goes. 4th tip learn to Use the maintenance category on the Intoxalock app. If you disconnect the battery for any reason for example you‚Äôre changing the battery because yours doesn‚Äôt have enough juice to start your car make sure you put that request in before you even touch the battery it will save you 100$ of dollars in Lockout fees. This applies to any maintenance that is done on the vehicle that requires the battery to be disconnected. 5th tip if it is very cold outside and you want to warm up your vehicle before you get in it first start the vehicle then hang the device from the mirror facing out so you can see it this requires you to stand by the door while the vehicle is in your driveway the reason you do this is because you will most likely have a retest before you vehicle is fully warmed up so you need to be able to see the device when it turns on. Mine normally takes about 5 minutes after the first start up. ONLY DO THIS IF YOU CAN SEE THE DEVICE FROM INSIDE. Don‚Äôt start the car then run upstairs and take a shower you will miss your retest and that will be a violation/Lockout. TIP#6 energy drinks depending on how many you drink and coffee with creamer will trigger a false negative if this happens and you are asked to Blow again DO IT! as this will save your ass in the long run because they will be able to tell if your levels have dropped in the 5 minute retest period. AS long as you haven‚Äôt been drinking you will pass the second test and it will not be a violation. The last tip and I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Do not get a portable breathalyzer off Amazon to try and beat the system the Intoxalock is calibrated to pick up on anything over 0.02 again people get confused here thinking as long as they are under the legal limit they can drive say you have 2 beers and go to blow into the device this will be an automatic Fail even if you are under the legal limit. And for those with a cancelled license. In Big bold letters it will say On the interlock programs website that ‚ÄúTHIS IS AN Abstinent program meaning you are not allowed to blow anything. Again this is the biggest issue I see in my state If you are going to drink then you have to sacrifice being able to drive your vehicle for a day possibly two which will result most likely in the device draining the battery so remember that. I‚Äôve had to learn all of these lessons the hard way and my solution was just quit drinking but for some people it is not that easy and I understand that.

I asked her if she wanted to go on a coffee date and she agreed. We both had a busy weekend so we agreed to meet early morning for about an hour and the date went extremely well. What was supposed to be an hour turned into about four (we both cancelled other plans with friends to keep talking). As the date ended we even agreed upon a date and time to go on our next date (disc golf as we both play). She was the one who brought up scheduling another date first. 

About an hour after the date I texted her saying that I had a great time and that I was looking forward to playing disc golf later in the week.

I got a message back saying that she didn't appreciate that I was being ""clingy"" with the message and that she was no longer interested in continuing to go on dates. Which, obviously, is her decision so I just thanked her for her time and wished her well. No response to that.

This was my first, first date in a couple of years, so I get that I'm probably out of the loop with what's common today. Kinda took myself out of the dating pool while I was trying to stabilize myself and my life post college, so not too sure on what proper etiquette is going forwards.

If you're looking to upgrade from a manual or have more budget for your first grinder the Eureka Mignon Zero is awesome!

I tentatively dipped my toe into the home espresso world around 18 months ago. I made a rookie error of buying really cheap blade grinder (a.k.a bean basher) and realized pretty quickly (speaking to a friend and watching a couple of James Hoffman vids) that really wasn't the way to go if I wanted to produce anything half decent.

FYI: We mainly drink espresso or espresso based coffee, personally love a Cortado or strong cappuccino.

After looking into it a bit more and seeing the prices of the decent electric grinders I was pretty scared of spending $400+ so I started looking at manual grinders.

After much research I opted for the KINgrinder K6 manual hand grinder. I loved this grinder and felt it was a great way to achieve a good quality grind without breaking the bank. Would highly recommend to anyone not wanting to go head first $$$ wise into their first grinder but still looking for decent quality. The only downside was the amount of complaining from GF having to manually grind the beans.

We used that grinder for I'd say around 12-14 months and have absolutely no complaints with it, other than the manual effort in grinding...

Upgrade time... Finally pulled the trigger on an electric grinder at went for the Eureka Mignon Zero. With taxes and delivery it came out around $500. It is a single dose grinder to I also bought a set of 12 tubes that we can pre-weigh and store beans into. With this combination of pre-weighed beans and electric grinder it's shaved a decent amount of time off prep time each morning (all about that efficiency lol).

The Zero is easy to use and easy to dial in. Took a little bit of figuring out on grind setting at first and had a few crappy pulls (to be expected) but now really happy and even when switching beans feel like I can get it dialed easily. It's pretty quiet which is nice and bellows seem to work very well with around 4-5 pushes to clear everything through.

Just thought I'd share this little journey in case it helps anyone else on their home espresso journey!",7,1737924387.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I hope to meet as many people in the community and to work with you to make the city a reflection of what we want. 

I am providing two videos. One is on a community garden, (something that numerous people have spoken to me about) this can be trying to partner with the city or if anyone has private land close to downtown. I've also spoken to a local business that shared they had thoughts of donating equipment for a community garden. The other video is on the importance of community.

Doing a weekly ‚Äúplanning date‚Äù with my partner is the best.,"I see so many posts on here about the negatives of wedding planning so I just wanted to throw a positive post in here! 

My partner and I do weekly planning dates on Sunday. We brew up some coffee, light up a candle, get all snuggled up, and go through our wedding planning book. (Or we get dressed and head out to a caf√©!) We use the ‚ÄúBudget-Savvy Wedding Planning and Organizer‚Äù by Jessica Bishop. 

We then spend about 1-2 hours going through different aspects of the book, discussing our likes and dislikes, our must-haves vs wants. We build Pinterest boards together - we have one for our wedding party outfits, one for decor, one for food, etc. We listen to music that means something to our relationship and pick where it would fit in during the day - is it a ceremony song, a dance song, a getting ready song, etc. Today, we worked on building our wedding website together and writing out the ‚ÄúOur Story‚Äù section was so fun and nostalgic. We‚Äôve been together almost 6 years and reliving our first date through his eyes felt so beautiful to me. 

I love that we started doing this about 1.5 years before our wedding because it‚Äôs made the whole process feel like we can take it slow and be really intentional with our choices. We already booked our venue and photographer and our #1 choice caterer said she‚Äôll have a quote and menu for us by Wednesday. 

Anyway, every Sunday my heart feels so full and so excited. I love that we‚Äôre able to follow the structure of the book to help guide us, while also building our own vision along the way. There‚Äôs been no fights, no hills to die on, no issues, and it‚Äôs just lovely. 

For those who haven‚Äôt yet tried ‚Äúplanning dates‚Äù, I highly suggest it. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a long date or fancy or expensive - just cozy and sweet and together. It helps put into perspective that this event really is a celebration of love and family. ",29,1737924293.0,weddingplanning,8,0.92,False

The only other requirement is that it be near a gym that I already pay a membership too. I‚Äôve attached the locations the gym has in Boston. ",0,1737924088.0,boston,48,0.5,False

**I am especially curious to hear from the other lgbt+ people who moved from America to Canada.**

*Before you comment, let me specify a few things...*

1. I understand no place is ""perfect"" but Canada *has* to be better than the US at this point.

2. Tell me all the good, bad and mid of living in Canada as a gay woman -- This includes healthcare system, taxes, which areas are best or worst, etc.

3. I understand it's a long process to move there and I am already doing my research for it.

\~\~\~

*QUESTIONS*

1. AREA & HOUSING

I am curious about an area that has the outdoor life & is relatively sunny throughout the year. I can deal with the cold if I know there will be a warmer and nicer summer/spring season.

I would like to live somewhere that is more safer for the lgbt+ than not. I understand Canada as a whole is safe but know there are some more anti-places still.

Someplace that is middle of the housing income -- don't need nor want super expensive, but would like a place with some culture. I am curious about living in a cottage.

I have family in Seattle and it would be nice to be relatively close to that area IF possible.



2. HEALTHCARE & RIGHTS

What is healthcare like for you? Really.

What are the women's right to choose like?

I am looking to marry and adopt in the next 4-5 years -- what does that look like in Canada?



3. ENTREPRENEUR

I am doing final touches on launching my coffee business in Colorado -- what would that process look like for coming over to Canada?

Getting good grades in her studies, a good-paying internship, and a cozy apartment that she shared with her perfect boyfriend. She couldn't imagine her life being any different, but of course, something had to go wrong.

Y/c was about to open the door to their apartment, but before she could twist the handle, it opened. Y/c‚Äôs boyfriend stood there. His eyes were red and his cheeks were wet. ‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù He said before walking past Y/c. ‚ÄúYou have changed too much.‚Äù He whispered as the two passed each other. 

That was the last thing Y/c heard or saw from her boyfriend. He was gone, just like that. Y/c couldn't afford the apartment alone, and reluctantly she agreed to rent the spare bedroom in her best friend's apartment. 

Elias Webb, is the newest recruit at the local NHL team, Wildshore Wolfs. At the age of 24, Elias is used to live fast- on the ice and in life. He is running from a past, littered with fights, bad press, and broken promises. Determined to prove that he is more than his reputation as a hot-headed wing. When he moves into town as a fresh start, his only focus is hockey.

That was until he met y/c. 

Their first meeting was anything but romantic. Elias accidentally bumps into Y/c at a caf√©, spilling her coffee all over her. Y/c glared daggers at him. There is something about her fire, her refusal to fall at his feet like everyone else, that pulls him in. Y/c on the other end wants nothing to do with this cocky hockey player, who seemed to have fallen out of a rom-com. 

Or at least that was what she thought. 

Y/c and her friend sat watching television. There was nothing on that night, so to Y/c‚Äôs disappointment, the two ended up watching the game. Y/c telling her friend all about how the cocky player spilled her coffee. He didn't even ask to buy her a new one. 

Suddenly he was on the tv. An interviewer asked him about himself. Suddenly he got a question about what he thought about the women in town. The hockey player smirked. Revealed a missing tooth. He chuckled. ‚ÄúActually, I met one today. Pretty fierce.‚Äù He admitted. The interviewer was clearly invested. ‚ÄúThis is a long shot, but if you are watching. Call the team number. Let me buy you another coffee.‚Äù He gave a wink to the camera before walking off. 

Y/c shook her head. No way. She was not going to give in to that cocky player. However, her friend had another idea. Y/c blamed all the books her friend read. After a long discussion between the two girls, she finally gave in. Called the number and explained what had happened, to prove it was her. 

Despite their differences, they can‚Äôt seem to stay away from each other. Their connection is electric, raw, and undeniable, but it‚Äôs also messy and volatile. Elias‚Äôs temper and Y/c‚Äôs guarded heart clash in explosive arguments that always seem to end in disagreement. Their love is a whirlwind of passion and pain, marked by moments of tender vulnerability‚Äîlike Elias showing Y/c how to skate under the stars or Y/c patching him up after a brutal game fight.",3,1737923663.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

""President Trump on Sunday announced ‚Äúemergency‚Äù tariffs on imports from Colombia, an early signal of how he might enact trade policy in the early days of his second term.¬†

Trump on his Truth Social platform said he would place 25% tariffs on ‚Äúall goods coming into the United States,‚Äù saying that would be lifted to 50% in one week.1¬†The trigger, Trump said, was Colombia‚Äôs refusal to let two repatriation flights from the U.S. land in Colombia. Colombian President Gustavo Petro acknowledged declining to receive the flights on social media.2

In addition to the tariffs, Trump announced a range of measures targeting Colombian officials, including a travel ban. ‚ÄúThese measures are just the beginning,‚Äù he wrote.¬†

Sunday‚Äôs announcement offers a degree of insight into how Trump‚Äôs¬†trade policy might unfurl¬†in the days and weeks immediately following his inauguration. He has declared an intention to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, but has yet to make formal announcements about those actions.¬†Economists generally believe the widespread use of tariffs could increase the prices paid for imported goods, though there is less ultimate effect of such tariffs.¬†

The U.S. had a $3.9 billion trade surplus with Colombia in 2022, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative, with total goods and services trade topping $53 billion.3¬†Top imports from Colombia include crude oil, coffee and flowers, according to the State Department, while top exports include oil, corn, and electrical equipment and parts.4""

1iapcmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisEtherWrites/comments/1iapcmc/my_wifes_cold_was_something_much_worse/,My wife's cold was something much worse,"For twenty-five years, I was in a rigid routine. I‚Äôd work in the mornings, come home to my wife later in the afternoons, and we‚Äôd spend our evenings together eating her home cooked meals and watching TV until night came and we would go to bed. Then we would do it all over again. Sometimes I would doubt our life together. A nagging voice in the back of my head told me I didn‚Äôt do enough for her. That we should want for more. But then I‚Äôd wake up, and hear her singing softly as she cooked our breakfast, and any doubts I had would fade away. We could have kept going like that forever, but we never got the chance.

I‚Äôm sat here alone now in our bedroom, huddled up in a blanket, typing on my laptop, and eating some awful fast food. I can‚Äôt bear to leave this room. I know that if I open that door and walk down that hall, I‚Äôll pass what used to be our kitchen. What remains is just an open, lifeless room. The cabinets had to be torn out and the floor ripped up from the damage. I arranged for some good men from the church to take the stove one day. I couldn‚Äôt bear to be there when they took it. I left the front door unlocked and hid like a coward, until I heard them leave.

I already burned through my bereavement leave, but I haven‚Äôt gone back to work. I just sit in our room and listen. I keep hoping to hear her voice again. Instead, all I hear is silence. The house is so quiet. So still. And in those endless spans of silence my mind fills in the void with harsh memories. The thoughts eat away at me like acid. Sometimes its questions, about what I could have done differently. Other times its like a film on repeat, the scenes playing out relentlessly. On the worst days, in the cold silence, the thing that consumes my mind are those final moments I had with her.

A week before it happened, she told me what was wrong. It was a warm Monday afternoon and I had just gotten home from work. She was in her usual place, cooking over the stove. The sound of sizzling pan-seared steak filled my ears. The room was slightly smoky and it smelt heavenly throughout the house. I could feel the heat as I walked into the kitchen to greet her.

She was wearing some jeans and that tan cardigan she liked over her blouse. I hugged her, head over her shoulder, and asked how she was doing today, like I did every day. I expected her to say something sweet in her usual way. Instead, she surprised me when she said,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm cold‚Äù.

I laughed at her. I thought it was a joke. I mean, it was a nice 84 degrees outside, and it was noticeably hotter in the kitchen. I genuinely thought she was just pulling my leg but no. She didn‚Äôt laugh back. Didn‚Äôt even smile. She rolled up her sleeve and showed me her goosebumps with a look of tentative concern.

We figured she had a weird fever. She didn‚Äôt feel particularly warm, but we decided to treat it like a fever anyways and I put her to bed after dinner, skipping our TV shows that night. She got under the covers, despite me telling her not to, but I let it slide. As I was leaving the room to let her rest, I remember how she grabbed my hand and she asked me if I would stay for a prayer. Church had always been more of her thing than mine, but I didn‚Äôt mind. I thought she might feel better if she did, so I closed my eyes and let her pray:

‚ÄúDear Heavenly Father, Hallowed be thy name. You are the Father of health and wellness and Satan is the father of sickness and suffering. I pray that this sickness will leave my body and I will feel your warmth once again. In your name I pray, amen.‚Äù

She seemed satisfied and I wanted to give her space so I left and tended to the house. I washed the dishes, cleaned up the kitchen, and watched some of our shows without her. I remember feeling lonely that night. Her absence felt like a tear in a winter coat. When I came to bed, I was relieved to have her by my side again. I was sure that in a day or two this fever would pass and she‚Äôd be right by my side again. But this wasn‚Äôt a fever.

Our routine was disrupted into something new. Something worse. Now, I‚Äôd come home, and go straight to our bedroom to see her. She insisted on turning off the fans and keeping the door shut. When I opened the door, my glasses fogged. I‚Äôd find her, kept under more blankets than I remembered giving her, usually sleeping. I‚Äôd sit by her, and ask her how she was feeling. Each day she gave the same one-word answer, each more disheartened than the last. ¬†

‚ÄúCold.‚Äù

The task of cooking fell on me, and I thought I couldn‚Äôt go wrong with some chicken noodle soup. It was supposed to help, but I‚Äôm no cook. There was always missing something. Something I couldn‚Äôt give it. But we ate it all the same. I learned I had to let it cool before I gave it to her, otherwise she‚Äôd scald her mouth, not that she seemed to mind.

After dinner, I would clean up, watch some shows alone while she went back to sleep, then I‚Äôd join her in bed. I‚Äôd try to snuggle up to her. To give her some of my body heat. I tried to take the cold from her. But after a time, I gave up. She was too cold to hold on to for any long period of time. I wish I held her anyways.

Sometimes, I would press my hand against her cheek. Then her forehead. Sometimes, she pressed back against my hand. This sickness had affected her physically, but under those blankets, behind the shivering, somewhere beyond the cold, the woman I loved was in there, fighting.

The earliest doctor‚Äôs appointment we could get was Thursday morning. I took some time off work in order to make the appointment. That morning was a relaxing 75 degrees, but looking at her, you wouldn‚Äôt know it. She wore a heavy coat and sweat pants with long johns underneath. A scarf and beanie hid her face from the world. Hidden behind the layers, her eyes looked tired.¬†

She got looks from the staff and patients alike in the clinic. I checked her in and she did her best not to chatter her teeth as I filled out the forms. In short, the clinic was a bust. They took her back there, and did a standard checkup. Nothing was out of the ordinary according to them. They chalked it up to poor circulation, wrote a prescription, and they sent us away without any other consideration. I made sure she took the medicine, but it didn‚Äôt help her. ¬†

I took a full day off work that Friday, and did what I could. I came back from the store that morning and began to haul in what should‚Äôve helped. I set up a space heater, draped a thick winter blanket over her, and assured her that I had been looking up recipes for some better soups. Despite all this, I heard her shivering as I closed the door.

She laid in there all day, only getting up to use the restroom, but that was getting less frequent. I would sit in there for ten minutes or so at a time, before having to leave again. The room was too hot now, and I couldn‚Äôt stand to be in there for any longer than I was. I checked on her often. Sat when I could. And when I was out, I would call the doctor again and explain that she was getting worse. She was getting colder. There was nothing they could or would do. Friday night came and went. More soup. More tea. More dishes. I had to take to sleeping on the couch, as our room was far too hot for me. Every couple hours I woke up alone, and when I did, I would walk over to the door, and listen for her. Once I heard her shivering. Another time she was snoring. Another, she was crying.

Saturday morning, I woke up later than normal. I began the new routine. Start the coffee, start the tea, start breakfast. It was quiet that morning. Lifeless. I could never cook like her. She had an aura about her that filled the house with energy when she cooked. Most mornings she‚Äôd be cooking, humming along to some song I never knew, without a care in the world. She was happy. Maybe that‚Äôs what my dishes were missing. Everything I cooked was made with worry.

I put it all on a tray and took it to our room. After a night without her I was determined to bear the heat and sit with her for longer. When I opened the door, I found our bed empty, seven blankets strewn about the room, thrown off without care, leading to our bathroom.

The shower was running. Steam billowed out of the bathroom and bled into our bedroom from behind the closed door. I put down the tray and knocked. Then again. Then with more urgency. Each time I got no answer. I had begun to sweat. The heat from the room was bad enough, but the steam from the bathroom felt scalding. I tried the door, but it was locked. I had to think but the heat was starting to take its toll on me. I felt sapped. Exhausted. How could she stand this horrible room? I yelled for her. And when I heard no answer, I used what strength I could muster, and kicked the door. Once. Then twice. Then the door gave way. The heat hit me like an oven, and inside, was my wife.

I found her in the shower, burned and shivering. She was sat on the shower floor with the water hitting her back. There was a big red circle where the water had burned her. Soft chunks of skin flowed off her back and toward the drain. I learned that she had turned the temperature on our water heater as high as it would go, and then turned the shower on and sat. She didn‚Äôt know how long she was in there. Or how long she would have stayed if I didn‚Äôt get her. All that she knew is that she was cold.

I got her out of the shower. She fought me till I mentioned the blankets, then she let me guide her back to bed. I dressed her wound the best I could with what we had and turned the water heater back down, cooler than before.

She got really low after that. She refused to go to the clinic again. Or anywhere for that matter. The heater and blankets were at home, and that‚Äôs where she demanded to stay.

That night, I sat with her. Sweat stained my clothes, but I paid it no mind. My wife needed me. I was at a loss, and I felt desperately powerless to help her. I prayed with her. I thought it‚Äôs what she needed, and it‚Äôs all I had left to try. I prayed like she had. I asked God for forgiveness and healing and warmth. I prayed with conviction. I nearly believed it. Maybe I just needed to believe in something. I knew that she believed in it, and if nothing else, I hoped that she would feel comfort in the prayer. When I stopped praying, she began her own prayer.

What she prayed, I can‚Äôt repeat. What I can say is that the cold had reached her heart and corrupted her faith. She said things I never thought I‚Äôd hear from a good Christian woman like her. She denied God, and His forgiveness. She promised her soul to the devil, as long as Satan promised that the fires of Hell were warm. Any enthusiasm, any hope she had was gone. The cold had taken it away.

I slept on the couch that night.

That Sunday morning, I woke up groggy. The couch had not been treating me well, and the anxiety had treated me worse. I got up anyways, and headed to the kitchen. It was time for the routine to start again. She needed me. More coffee, more tea, more breakfast that doesn't quite taste right.¬†

When I got to the kitchen, I heard that familiar humming. That comforting sound of cabinets and drawers opening and shutting. She was back, and she was cooking up something heavenly. It smelt like a ham steak, and I remember thinking that was a strange choice for breakfast, but I was just happy that she was feeling like herself again. She was wearing shorts and a tank top. She was reaching on her tip toes for something deep in the cabinet, when I walked in to greet her.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs for breakfast, dear?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt acknowledge me. She just kept looking in the cabinet above the stove. I looked at the stove top, and saw that the burner was on. As she was reaching further back into that cabinet, she had placed her hand on the burning cast iron pan, and it was sizzling.

The adrenaline hit my blood like cement. She found what she was looking for. Before I could comprehend what was happening, she had doused herself in cooking oil. She turned to face me. In her mangled hand she held a matchbox. In her good hand she held a match.

In an instant she and the kitchen were engulfed in flames. She didn't scream. She didn't flail around. She sat on the ground, arms hugging her knees to her chest. Among the crackling of the fire, I heard her teeth chatter. She shivered while she burned.

My wife is gone. My life is gone. I have nothing but the memories and this feeling I can‚Äôt shake.

¬†Dear Agent‚Äôs Name,

(Here I try to include a personal reference such as a book on a wishlist)

I am seeking representation for my 105,000-word adult fantasy novel FRAYMOON.

Even before she opens her eyes, Amihan knows her baby Hintua is gone. There is a faint metal smell, a bitter thread, in her sweetest thing. This a false-Hintua, a perfect doll. She nurses the hateful thing, and thinks. Others failed because they were weak. Amihan will go to the Fell Mountain, where the kindly neighbors surely have her child. She will have to travel the world, scale the peak, a blade rearing through the sky into airless black‚Äîfor all she has never been away from her village.

Robbing her in-laws of the makings of magic, and her great-uncle of his tools for fighting monsters‚Äîfor he was a tiavaram-hunter in his day‚Äîshe sets off, hiding in the jungle. She is attacked by a blood-tiavaram, Leofsige, a beautiful thing, and compels him to her service. They are joined by her childhood best friend, Liantaika, who has escaped his brutal master with endless charms, including the atsar bombs that can break the world.

¬†With their help she traverses cursed millet fields and bamboo cities lashed to the sides of ancient spanbridges. She avenges difficult ghosts, and finds, in an entombed restaurant, true treasure: music older than any can say.

¬†Throughout, they must defend against ever more violent attacks by the Academic Wizards, desperate to regain the charms Liantaika stole. These are both terrifying and sometimes comical, as charms are strange; Amihan comes near death being scalded in coffee with condensed milk. Amihan can see that Liantaika‚Äôs love is only deepening, but she has never returned his affections. She is at war with herself as to whether Leofsige is even a thing one could love. Eventually they find the Mountain is something impossibly different than they imagined.

¬†Readers of Hannah Kind, particularly *White Cat, Black Dog* will appreciate the fairy-tale elements made radically anew, while Fraymoon shares with T. Kingfisher‚Äôs *Nettle and Bone* the vein of absurdism running through the dangers faced by the characters. Reaching into classic fantasy, this is the world of Gene Wolfe and Jack Vance‚Äôs *Dying Earth*.

¬†I am a late-in-life first time author, a Savannah native who has lived half my life in Singapore after studying classics, linguistics, and philosophy at Columbia and Berkeley. I have published some flash fiction and a coming story, but I lavished my care here. There are a bare minimum of invented words based on Malayo-Polynesian. No songs in Elvish, just enough to create a sense of the home Amihan leaves behind. Fraymoon can be read alone but has strong series potential.

Thanks for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you,

Yours,

Xxxxx xxxxxx

¬†

As you can see from my first attempt the criticism was from the angle of cultural appropriation in my having the MCs be from Pangasinan rather than the query letter per se. I took this to heart and created a Malayo-Polynesian conlang. Only a small number of words appear (maybe 20?), it's not tiresome, meant to create a sense of place from the start. Pangasinan-specific elements were removed also. Amihan's name remains because I'm attached to it, but if readers thought every vestige of the Phillipines should be shaved off its ok. I mention it in the query because the language I use could well seem real to a reader and then the agent would imagine I was doing the same thing over again. But it may not be needed. I also tried to respond to the letter-specific suggestions and I think it is improved. Thanks for your consideration and time.",0,1737923219.0,PubTips,4,0.5,False

1iapbjo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iapbjo,I flew Club World from LHR to DFW,"Last Saturday I upgraded from WT to CW on the spur of the moment (I made a post about it here https://www.reddit.com/r/BritishAirways/s/dH6LWLTQy5). I promised someone a bit of a write up so here I am, I'll break it down for you. I appreciate some people will travel CW frequently but this is for those wondering if it's worth spending the extra if offered a cheaper upgrade. In my case just under ¬£900.

Check in/Security - obviously check in was way faster. The WT queue was halfway across T5. Security was super quick and I was in departures in a couple of minutes.

Lounge - I was flying to DFW and knew I'd be leaving from a C gate, I also knew of the lounge at the B gates even though it isn't particularly well signposted. Got in and found a nice place to sit and helped myself to breakfast, coffee etc. I was about to leave when I got a text from BA that the flight was delayed so I sat tight and had another coffee.

Boarding - Group 3 so pretty early on to the plane. Plane info - A380 XLEE so has the older style CW seats, not the suite. I was in seat 10A which is lower deck, first CW row in the middle. I was expecting someone to be next to be but incredibly I ended up having both seats to myself so I had plenty of room to stretch out, it also came in handy for landing (more info later). Champagne on boarding, then a G&T and snack once airborne. I've attached a copy of the food menu.

First food service arrived around 1hr in, I started with smoked salmon, beef fillet for main, and the chocolate thing for dessert. Accompanied with another G&T and a glass of red.

After that I watched a film and with the aid of the fully flat bed managed a couple of hours sleep. Woke up with around 3hrs remaining so watched some The Cleaner S3.

Afternoon Tea was served around 2hrs before landing and was very good. Coffee was leagues ahead of the brown water you get in WT. Had another G&T after this because why not.

Landing - nice and quick off the plane due to.beimg at the front so that helped with the usual queues at border control.

Overall: was it worth it? In this very specific case yes, if I'd been sharing the 'cuddle' seat with a stranger I'd be inclined to say no. If I'd got the Club Suite upgrade at the same price then 100% yes. The whole experience from start to finish is just so much more comfortable and less stressful. I arrived feeling well rested and not at all like I'd just done a 10.5hr flight.

I‚Äôm helping my grandma go through my late grandfathers coin collection. I‚Äôm more of an amateur silver bug than a coin collector and typically stick to new eagles and keep my eye out for pre-64 coins. I‚Äôm the only grandchild interested in silver coins so my grandmother has already been gifting me and my sons some of these coins for birthdays and Christmas. 

I‚Äôve offered to buy them at fair market value but wasn‚Äôt sure what to offer and wanted to get some opinions. We have about 10 coffee cans of coins to go through including a lot of non-silver ‚Äúnew‚Äù coins that I‚Äôm not interested in. In our first coffee cans, this is what we found thus far in regards to silver:
- 4 - Morgan‚Äôs see photos for years
- 52.5 oz of walking liberty coins - various years, well circulated 
-  14.5 oz of Franklin half dollars - mixed year and condition 
-original Nixon-Agnew pin dates this coffee can back to 1968
-entire coffee cans of 1943 steel Pennies 

I‚Äôm expecting around 200 ounces total of silver quarters, dimes and nickels.  

Any help on what a fair price per ounce or price per coin would be is appreciated. I offered my grandma 90% of spot price and she said that was too much. We also may also check out a couple local coin shops to see what they will offer but I feel like that will be on the low end of the spectrum. Thanks in advance! ",1,1737923090.0,coins,2,1.0,False

My go to right now is the brazen for everyday drip with pre-ground coffee and creamer. Then my roasted beans on the weekend in the aeropress with just a hint of sugar.

Anyways, I've been considering the following:
Bambino ($300 amazon)
Bambino Plus ($500 amazon)
Hibrew H10a ($260 amazon)
Gemilai G3007L ($430 with amazon coupon)

I'm leaning mostly towards the Gemiai. I like to tinker and mess around with most things to get the best out of something cheaper. I do like the instand hot water/brewing of the Bambinos. The Hibrew seems interesting at its price point.

For grinders, I've mostly been considering the following:
DF54 ($230 pre-order ship early march)
DF64 v2 ($320 on aliexpresss shipping from Us)

My guess is that I will mostly do espresso/Americanos and my wife flavored milk drinks. I used to really like light roasted Ethiopia beans black but have fallen in the cheapness/convenience of preground with creamer since that's what my wife also enjoys.
