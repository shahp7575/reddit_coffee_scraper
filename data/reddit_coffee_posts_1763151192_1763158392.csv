My name is Sergei — I live in Boston and work here as a UI architect.
In my free time I’ve been developing a theoretical model that grew into something larger than I expected, and I’m now preparing a first paper submission to arXiv.

I’m looking for help with two things:

1. arXiv endorsement

I need someone who already has posting rights in either general physics, general relativity & quantum cosmology, statistical mechanics, or (maybe) mathematical physics, depending on the final category.
If you’re an arXiv author and don’t mind helping with a straightforward endorsement, I’d really appreciate it.
It’s literally a one-click action and does not imply agreement with or responsibility for the content.

2. Feedback / validation from local physicists or mathematicians

I’m developing a framework tentatively called Matrix Field Theory — a fully discrete, local, bit-level computational model where spacetime, causality, particles, and interactions emerge from simple flip rules on a 3D lattice.
It sits somewhere between lattice statistical mechanics, discrete QFT intuitions, and causal graph models.

My background is in applied mathematics, but I haven’t done serious math for about 10 years (I work in software), so I’m very open to feedback, criticism, and reality checks from people who actually do this every day.

If you’re local and have a background in:
	•	mathematical physics
	•	GR / cosmology
	•	particle physics / field theory
	•	lattice models
	•	statistical mechanics
	•	dynamical systems
	•	theoretical CS
	•	or just enjoy dissecting unconventional models

…I’d love to meet for coffee, chat online, or share the current draft.

I’m not looking for blind agreement — I genuinely want knowledgeable people to help stress-test the ideas or point out where things break.

If you also know any better subreddits to post this in (Boston-related or academic), please let me know.

Thanks!

1ox9qw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreshroastSR800/comments/1ox9qw3/home_roasting/,Home Roasting,"I have been obsessing over the possibility of home roasting this past week. So glad to have found this group.

I have been receiving  
Peets coffee direct from the roastery the past couple years. I have gotten to  
try lots, and I have discovered natural process beans are my favorites.  
Especially their Arabian Mocha Sanani, and the Ethiopian Super Natural (when  
available). The Sanani has a sort of long red wine finish I like (I don't know  
the proper syntax). Peets describes the Sanani as more than half way from Light  
to Dark. Still, it is not the oily bean you would find in a really dark roast.  
I don’t think Peets sells any that dark. Body is 3/4 of the way from Light to  
Full. Brightness is about 1/3 of the way from Low to High. Is it possible to  
roast like this with the SR800?

I have been quite  
enjoying these beans, but I do notice the flavors are not as vibrant as time  
passes. I do take care to store the beans in 2 oz mason jars, in the dark, and  
generally around 59 degrees. 

I don’t expect to be able  
to roast as good as Peets, but during my last Peets shipment, first cup was 8  
days after roast. I figure a one lb bag from Peets will last 17.8 days. The  
last brew will be about 25 days after roast  
*if* I don’t alternate with another bean *(which I prefer)*. Realistically, how many batches will I trial before getting  
something good enough to approach a Peets Sanani which is well stored, but 20  
days after roast? I don’t mind paying the Peets price – but will my home  
roasted coffee taste better?  

Thanks,

**SINGER:** *Scooby-Dooby-Doo, Where Are You!* *We got some work to do now.* *Scooby-Dooby-Doo, Where Are You!* *We need some help from you now.*

*Come on, Scooby-Doo, I see you...* *pretending you got a sliver!* *You're not foolin' me, 'cause I can see,* *the way you shake and shiver!*

**\[HARD CUT\]**

**THE MYSTERY MACHINE, PLOWING THROUGH A MUDDY JUNGLE ROAD.** **LOCATION: CAPIZ, PHILIPPINES.**

The van hits a massive pothole, sending Shaggy and Scooby flying into the air.

""Zoinks!"" Shaggy yelped, landing in a pile of ropes. ""Like, Fred, are you sure this is the right way to the 'All-You-Can-Eat' *Lechon* festival?""

Fred, gripping the wheel, checked the map. ""I'm sure, Shaggy. We got an official invitation from the *barangay* elder. He says there's a mystery here that's scaring everyone.""

Velma pushed her glasses up, reading from a thick book. ""Jinkies. This is fascinating. The region is a hotbed for what anthropologists call 'sociological possession.' They have a local cryptid, an 'Aswang,' which is a shape-shifting, vampiric ghoul.""

""R-R-R-ASWANG?!"" Scooby gulped, leaping into Shaggy's arms.

""Like, that sounds... *un-groovy*,"" Shaggy shivered. ""That sounds, like, the *opposite* of *lechon*!""

Daphne fanned herself. ""Oh, but isn't it *exotic*? A real Filipino mystery! I just hope this humidity doesn't ruin my hair.""

The Mystery Machine rolled into the *barangay* clearing. The villagers stared, silent. The elder, Mang Berto, walked out of his hut, his face a mask of profound, bone-deep *exhaustion*.

He looked at the garishly painted van. He looked at the tall blonde, the one in the ascot, the one in the orange sweater, the beautiful redhead, and the giant, trembling dog.

Mang Berto sighed, rubbing his temples.

""Ah, *puta*,"" he muttered, loud enough for them to hear. ""The Americans. *Again*.""

Fred stepped out, all confidence. ""Sir! Fred Jones, from Mystery Incorporated. We're here to help you catch your... *'Ass-Wang'*?""

""It's *Aswang*,"" Velma corrected. ""Sir, we're here to investigate the mass hysteria that's gripped your village.""

Mang Berto just stared at Fred, then at Scooby. ""...Does... does the dog *talk*?""

""Ruh-roh!"" Scooby said, hiding behind Shaggy.

Mang Berto just nodded, completely unfazed. ""Okay. A talking dog. Why not. It's not the weirdest thing that's happened this... *e-hem*... this 'thousand-year-old' curse.""

He pointed to the jungle. ""It lives there. Sometimes it's a giant bat. Sometimes a black dog. Sometimes... a green one. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have... *paperwork*.""

The elder walked back into his hut, leaving the gang standing alone.

""Well,"" said Daphne. ""He seemed... *busy*.""

""Jinkies,"" Velma said, tapping her chin. ""He's not acting like a typical 'spooked local.' He's not scared... he's... *annoyed*.""

""Gang,"" Fred said, ""this is a real mystery. There's only one thing to do. Let's split up and look for clues!""

**TEAM 1: THE JUNGLE**

""Like, why do *we* always get the *creepy-haunted-jungle* part of the plan?"" Shaggy whimpered, holding a flashlight.

""Reah!"" Scooby agreed, his tail between his legs. ""R(h)creepy!""

""The only thing I'm hunting for is a snack! I'm so hungry I could eat... I don't know... a *Jollibee*!""

Scooby's nose went up. ""R(h)Jollibee?"" He sniffed the air. He padded over to a large *balete* tree. Hidden in the roots was a small pile of... wrappers.

Shaggy picked one up. ""Hey! It *is*! A *Jolly Spaghetti* container! And... Choco-Mallows! And... like... a *receipt*?""

Suddenly, a terrifying roar echoed from the trees. ""RRAAAAAARGH!"" A massive, horse-headed creature—a *Tikbalang*—crashed through the bamboo.

""**YIKES!**"" ""**ZOINKS!**"" ""**R-R-R-TIKBALANG!**""

Shaggy and Scooby took off, the *Tikbalang* chasing them. It was a classic chase scene, set to a bubblegum-pop song. They ran through hollow logs, swung on vines, and ended up disguised as *lechon* on a spit-roast. The *Tikbalang* just roared, ""I'M... GONNA... *GET* YOU!""

**TEAM 2: THE VILLAGE**

""Fred,"" Daphne said, holding up a cast. ""I found a footprint near the hut the monster attacked.""

Fred looked at it. ""This is... a *huge* footprint. But... it's not a paw. Or a hoof. It... it looks like... a *Nike Air Jordan, Size 10*.""

Velma, meanwhile, was analyzing the ""Jollibee"" receipt. ""This is our monster, all right. And he's got... a *loyalty card*? This isn't a ghost, gang. This is just some... *kid* with a *really* big appetite.""

""RAGGY!"" ""RAAARGH!""

Shaggy and Scooby burst into the clearing, the *Tikbalang* right behind them.

""Jeepers!"" Daphne screamed. ""Fred, now!"" Velma yelled.

""Okay, gang! The trap!"" Fred shouted. They pulled a rope. A giant net, woven from *rattan* and *coconut husks*, fell from a tree... and landed *perfectly* on the *Tikbalang*.

The creature struggled for a second, then just... stopped. It sighed. A long, exasperated, *teenage* sigh.

""Aw, *man*!"" a voice groaned from under the net. ""A *net*? Seriously? You guys are *so* old-school. Do you know how long this snout took me to get right? This is, like, my *masterpiece*!""

The *Tikbalang* shimmered... its shape collapsing. The horse-head shrank, the fur receded, and the huge body compressed...

...into a very annoyed, green-skinned teenager in a black-and-purple uniform.

""BEAST BOY?!"" the whole gang yelled in unison.

Beast Boy ripped the net off. ""Hey, guys! What are *you* doing here? This is *my* gig!""

**THE UNMASKING**

Mang Berto walked back out of his hut, holding a coffee mug. ""The green one. You are back. And you brought... hippies. *Puta*. You know what? I don't even care.""

Fred pointed. ""So, *you're* the 'Aswang' that's been terrorizing this village!""

""Like, *he's* the 'Ass-Wang'?"" Shaggy said, emerging from a clay pot.

Beast Boy dusted himself off. ""I wasn't *terrorizing*! I was *performing*! I... I kinda ran away from the Titans. They don't *appreciate* my art. Robin said my *Manananggal* form was 'aerodynamically inefficient.'""

Velma put it all together. ""Jinkies! Of *course*! The 'shape-shifter'... the different forms... the *Jollibee* wrappers... It was *you* all along!""

Beast Boy looked proud. ""Yeah! This village is *great*! Back home, I'm just 'the comic relief.' Here... I'm a *god*! They were gonna build a statue of me! ...Well, a statue to *run away* from, but still! It's *respect*!""

Fred crossed his arms. ""Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. The 'Aswang' of Capiz... was just a very insecure, meta-human teenager.""

Shaggy walked over, patting Beast Boy on the back. ""Like, I get it, man. Sometimes you just wanna be taken seriously. Right, Scoob?""

""Reah! R(h)taken... seriously... with R(h)Jollibee!"" Scooby said, eyeing the receipt.

Beast Boy's stomach growled. ""You guys want some? I know where a *Kapre* (tree giant) hid a box of *Choco-Pies*...""

""Like, you're speaking my language!"" Shaggy said.

I have been getting pretty decent shots in general, but there’s something bugging me: once I dial in my shot, using the exact same grind setting, the following shot will brew way faster.

E.g. I just dialed in my (18gr in, 36 out) shot with a grind setting of 3J on my Forté: a delicious 20sec shot. Next shot was 11 seconds, taste was ok, a lot more crema.

I’m lazy so I don’t temp surf, but I’m very consistent with my procedure. Turn it on, wait 15 minutes, 3 sec flow before loading the portafilter, then brew.

This happens anytime I dial in, either it’s my 1st and 2nd shot or if it’s 4th and 5th (with the exception of the crema I observed today).

A few questions,"I've owned several Fellow accessories throughout my coffee journey, but a few months ago, I switched from the Breville Precision Brewer to the Fellow Aiden and fell in love. Even better, my wife fell in love. So I ended up expanding my collection to the Stagg Pro and, as of today, the Ode Gen 2. I just had a few questions.

1. Does the front facia always feel loose? The square piece with the dial indicator numbers feels incredibly loose, and if I nudge the grinder, I can hear it move. Not a dealbreaker, didn't know if that was within QC tolerance.

2. Do the Fellow drops ever come with recommended grind settings for their grinders?

3. I drink anything from extremely light to mildly dark medium roasts. Mainly in the V60, although the Aiden is getting a lot of use lately, and typically as a batch brew. I'm curious to know whether the SSP burrs are a worthwhile upgrade. I have the room in the budget (I was willing to spend around $750 on the grinder total), just not sure if they'd make _that_ much of a difference.",1,1763156698.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False

I broke up with my girlfriend for 3 years because she lied to me, there has been countless times I am certain she did but I just simply ignore or choose not confront here but last night was different.

Context: last Thursday she took her passport with her friends and they decided to go to a coffee shop which is not part of their usual plan so my gf here asked me for permission which is for me all goods since she barely have the time to go out and enjoy her life due to academic reasons, but I actually didn't give her any permission since I was asleep, (due to headache) her last update to me was around 1:30 stating that they will go out to have some coffee (no info where or how long they will stay) so for 5 hrs there's no update, I messaged her around 4 pm no reply, so I am worried since Idk where the hell she is since she didn't update me if she's already in the coffee shop or what, so again I messaged her around 6 then she replied around 7:30 saying that her phone was lowbatt and that she messaged me before she turned it off, (she's implying that it must've been some error in messenger) which is for me stupid, since she had a lot of time to update me, so we had an argument, tbh, I don't mind her going out with her friends, what offends me is that she thinks that I'm choking her, that I always starts an argument whenever she go out (which is wrong, because I'm just simply mad because there's no update, and I'm worried) then to cut the chase last night, I checked her battery graph it showed that her phone still has power and she didn't really turned off (she just simply ignored me) and when I confronted her about it, she keeps denying it until I provide the evidence then now she's admitted it and saying that she's jusst afraid that I wouldn't let her go out with her friends which is stupid for me bcz her friends are much more important than me, and she's willing to make a fool out of me just to protect herself so I ended things up between us, 

Idk, guys but I really feel empty—it sucks that I'm right yet she's still making me look like the bad guy and there's not even a hint of regret in her eyes she just simply justified her wrong doings, idk, I was looking forward to continue our relationship but I don't really know if we would be able to recover froom this,",3,1763156693.0,adviceph,3,1.0,False

What’s your morning routine like? I usually wake up, make coffee and then sit on the couch and doom scroll while contemplating life. Wondering if it’s all really work it. And then I get up and go to work 🤣

I have two doggos, they’re basically the main character of my life at this point. So if you come for the dog tax, I got you covered! 

I started getting back into gaming, so I play for an hour or two each night. I play a bit of everything but always looking for recommendations and people to game with! 

I’m an outdoors person, I’m usually out camping, hunting, hiking, backpacking, off-roading or at the beach with the dogs. I work basically 24/7, well I’m on call all hours of the day when I’m not actually at work. So that’s a thing.

“Carryall prepping, will hold launch until you’re clear,” Savvie said with a sigh.

“A bit premature, Savvie.  Let me win first,” Jacob chuckled.

Jacob had dodged to the undamaged side of the Crab, silently grinning as it struggled to turn to follow him.  The other Ritter pilots weren’t having any trouble tracking him; they were a good hundred and fifty metres away, and they slowly turned to bring their batteries to bear on the Snapdragon.  When they were in position, it was unlikely that they’d miss.  At least he’d bought some life for the remaining squishies.

He lashed out with his left leg, jets firing on both calves, while bringing his ablative shield up across his torso and the delicate sensor arrays mounted in the head section of the Ritter.  The badly damaged legs on the other side of the Crab buckled as its full weight, combined with the force from Jacob’s overheating jumpjets that empowered his kick, flicked all of its mass onto the damaged limbs.  His real foot ached at the impact.

Beams flicked past him as the Lance brought its right arm in line with Jacob and wasted its first shot.  The insectile mech twitched as the green and blue streaks ionised the air around Jacob but failed to connect.  That was unprofessional of the pilot; he should have held his shot for when the Snapdragon landed, and he might have gotten a solid hit.  

The Crab slammed down on its side, crushing half its legs, and Jacob cancelled his jets, dropping down behind the upturned mech, crouching, and using it as cover.  The undamaged legs waggled futilely in the air over Jacob’s head as its pilot tried to right itself for a moment, then it cut power and deactivated.  One down and surrendered.

He patched into the feed from the Wasp, which was busy dodging some ineffective anti-air fire from the Magco squishies, and linked to the stream from the cameras focused on the remaining enemy Ritters.  They launched a volley of green and blue lines from their focusing arrays into the back of their disabled ally, melting holes into the light upper armour and slagging its internals.  *Friends like these, eh?  Fucking corpos,* Jacob mentally sneered.

He raised his right hand over the lip of his improvised barricade and unleashed a controlled burst at the Lance.  It was the more dangerous of the pair, slightly outclassing his own Snapdragon and far superior to the outdated Crab design.  He laid his shield against the underside of his first victim and braced.  Two hundred and twenty rounds left for his only long-range weapon, and the lance had only taken superficial damage.

Pistons screamed, and structural warning lights went off in his mind as he shoved the Crab ten metres towards his next victims, keeping low and pumping the mech's legs to try and keep the light Ritter sliding along the dusty ground.  The stabilising field generators built into his feet struggled to prevent him from digging his legs into the dirt.  The actuator in his left hip flared with heat, and he dumped cryoliquid on it, praying the sudden temperature change didn’t do more damage.

The first volley of magcannon rounds had knocked the Lance back, twisting it to one side.  Its left arm was still pointed in his general vicinity, and the harsh glare of more lasers cut into the downed Crab’s carapace.

The second Crab was scuttling closer, both claws locked on Jacob’s position, but holding fire.  Jacob hated going up against a competent enemy.  The Lance fired, trying to track the beams onto Jacob’s exposed arm, still poking above his improvised protection and pouring EFP rounds at the taller Ritter.

Jacob snatched his arm back and considered his options.  The Lance pilot was scared, lobbing inaccurate fire at an obviously jacked pilot was pure desperation.  But the Crab pilot was holding an alpha strike, a full salvo from all its weapons, coming a little closer, but circling round to flank Jacob from the north.  Checking his map, Jacob saw elements of the Magco squishies moving up to support the Crab.  In addition to trigger discipline, the pilot had the rank needed to boss around squadrons of tanks.  The Crab was the real threat.

He would need to time this very carefully.  Jacob watched from the Wasp as the Crab crept closer, swinging wide and getting dangerously close to the gantry that housed the mission-critical elevator.  That structure was vital, so he quickly worked out his plans, focusing on balancing the risk of it getting damaged against his own survival.

A barrage of tank fire from Upton’s troopers slammed into the Crab's left claw, the lucky strike forcing the limb slightly to one side but doing no real damage.  Sending a prayer of gratitude to the squishies, Jacob broke into a sprint, steam hissing from the Snapdragon’s left hip as the cryoliquid evaporated away.  His right arm was aimed at the Lance, putting down half-second bursts to keep the pilot off balance, while his left shielded his torso from the beam weapons of the second Crab.

Emerald lasers slammed into his shield, making his real arm burn within the core, and his head exploded in agony as his sensor pod took a hit.  His systems glitched, and he frantically cut out the damaged sections, relying on the feed from the Wasp and his secondary sensors as he lunged towards the crafty mech.  Pain was normal.  He shunted it aside, pushing through it and finding a familiar clarity waiting for him.  He could feel it later, but for now, he had more important things to do.

The hit must have made the enemy pilot bold.  On a normal Ritter, that kind of damage would be catastrophic in terms of the pilot's awareness of the battlefield; on a jacked pilot, it could send them into seizures if they were unlucky.  Jacob didn’t have to fake a few blasts from his magcannon going wide to fuel the possible delusion as he searched for a solution.  The Crab scuttled closer to him, rebuilding charge for another alpha strike.

With his sensor pod totalled, the head section of the Snapdragon was just a jagged wound sending spikes of agony into his temples.  He switched his perspective back to the Wasp, which was floating half a mile to the north. It was awkward for precision work like aiming, but he was able to guide his charging mech as close as he dared before making his move.  Jacob had cut west a little as he sprinted, making sure the elevator wouldn’t be directly behind the Crab when he opened fire.

His shield swung down to reveal the Snapdragon’s all-important torso section, and he unleashed both of his remaining rocket salvos into the Crab, one after the other, before the enemy mech could cycle its beam weapons again.  At less than fifty metres, the projectiles dispersed a little, but the grouping was still tight for an unguided weapon.  Lances of magma, molten metal from the penetrator heads, eviscerated the Crab, carving a glowing crevice into its armour and killing the pilot outright.  One of them must have hit a battery as the resulting discharge turned the world white, arcs of lightning snapping away from the Ritter to slam into the dirt and, unfortunately, the elevator.

Jacob ignored it; he wasn’t blinded because the wasp was far enough away that the flash was just a moment's glare, not the overwhelming lightshow it would have been if he’d been using his own sensor pod.  He pivoted to bring his shield between himself and the Lance as more beams flashed past him.  One stuck his right thigh, the pain intense, but he dumped the last of his cryofluid out of the internal vents in the limb and swung his magcannon back on target.

He was dependent on Resilience.  In some ways, he always was, but now he was forced to rely on the algorithms and programs in a way that left him feeling like a passenger rather than a pilot.  He couldn’t calculate the angles based on the images from the Wasp.  *Trust the core.*  His father's words from some long-ago training sim that had ended in disaster echoed in his mind as he fought down his instinct to seize control of the Snapdragon.  The programming of Resilience wasn’t AI, but it was as close as was legally permitted in the Protectorate.  Trust the machine.

More tank rounds slammed out from his supports, and the Lance actually baulked.  The pings of squishy fire were par for the course to a Ritter, something to be ignored or punished, not feared.  Jacob wondered how green the pilot must be, using the thought to distract himself from his urge to take back control of his right arm.

The magcannon roared, and the rounds flew true as he stopped firing, stitching a line across the angled plates of the Lance's torso that blew glowing craters in the armour.  The mech sagged, the arms going limp and knees bending.  Another surrender.  Victory.  

***Synchonisation Increased!*** 

***Snapdragon 23%->25%***

From the Wasp’s eye view that he was currently limited to, Jacob took a moment to reflect sadly on the line of burning hulks the Hansa reserves had left behind them as they played bait to cover his approach.

“Savvie, drop the Carryall.”  His voice was flat and dead, the end of battle stealing some of his normal bravado as the world slowed down and became mundane once again.  Jacob switched back to the local net.  “Upton.  Push up.  Their Ritters are down.  I’m calling salvage rights on the Archon, the Lance and the Crab that’s on its side. We have a Carryall inbound, do not tag it or I will be pissed.”

“Ain’t much you can do about it if my sensors are right.  You’re pretty beat up,” Upton chuckled grimly.  

“Betrayal would be a really dumb move about now, Commander.  If I have to, I’ll call in an orbital strike.”

“That would destroy a priceless archaeological site and void our contract.”

“It’s better than dying.”

“Don’t worry, Ritter, the League keeps its contracts, no matter how much of a bastard the merc might be.  The elevator is intact; thankfully, the discharge just blew its electronics.  Upton out”

Jacob knew it wasn’t worth talking to the man anymore, and the fact that the mission-critical asset had survived in satisfactory condition was a boon.  It had also been the right call to use the reinforcements as bait, despite the murky feeling in his guts.  The Lance had been shit-tier, but that second Crab… its pilot would have cooked him before he made it halfway if it hadn’t been turned at an off angle when he charged.

“Acknowledged.”  His voice was cold.

***Status…***

***Snapdragon chassis: Armour 63% Internal 71%***

***Power levels: 89%***  

***Combat time available: 8 days, 4 hours, 20 minutes.***

***Equipment:***

***Holosinth Corporation Light Rocket Pod: empty***

***Browning Industries Jaeger Magcannon: Fire rate 120 rounds a minute, 42 rounds onboard.***

***Twinned IAP 120mm Mortars: empty***

***Galtech Plasma Cutter.  High energy drain.***

***Norwes Professional Ablative Shield.***

***Jumpjets: 73kg reaction mass.***

The Snapdragon had taken more of a beating than he’d hoped.  The aches and pains from the damage feeding back along his link to Resilience were the least of his worries.  His components had survived, thankfully, but the shield would need re-plating, and armour wasn’t cheap.  It would burn most of the stocks he had aboard Humility to patch Snappie back up.  The life of a merc was always filled with ever-increasing expense.

He tracked the Carryall down via the Wasp.  A huge, flattened brick of a craft, it was designed to drop a full fist of six heavy Ritters to the surface, or recover them back to orbit.  Savvie rather pointedly insisted on collecting the Archon and the Lance before extending the mag tethers to pick up Jacob, so he was left observing as the Hansa tanks and APCs crawled past him, driving the retreating Magco forces before them.  As Jacob rose back into orbit, he lost his connection to the Wasp and switched to the Carryall’s cameras.  

Approaching the starship always filled him with a sense of dread and awe.  Humility was a vast ovoid of silvery metal, creeping closer as they left the atmosphere behind.  With her weapon ports sealed and thrust nascelles irised shut, she looked like a kilometre-long lozenge of stainless steel.  The outer shell was a far more complex alloy of metasteel and ceramics than it appeared to be at first glance.  The old ship had fought in the Larkon Resolution two hundred and fifty years ago under the command of Jacob’s great-to-the-Nth-degree grandmother, and dozens of fleet actions since then, but despite her sleek appearance and glorious history, she was a shadow of her former self.

The Carryall slid into the docking bay and settled into its housing.  The metasteel cables lowered the three mechs down to the machinist’s floor and retracted, snapping off as atmosphere flooded the compartment.  Jacob reached out and reconnected with the Humility’s systems, initiating the core removal process.

\*\*\*

“So what are you thinking?” asked Harkon as he sipped at his glass of water.  A celebration had been ordered in the lounge of the Humility, and all the crew had been asked to gather to celebrate the successful mission.

“What *was* he thinking when he delayed his chute release is the better question,” grumbled Savvie as she reached for her own glass.  She pushed her short platinum hair back over her right ear, her eyes focused on Jacob, the contrasting blue and red irises giving her a demonic glare.

Jacob shared a broad smile with the pair.  “Well, for the latter, I wanted to make an entrance; a dramatic arrival is a good way to throw off the enemy.  It saved on ammo as well.  As to the former… I don’t know.  We’ll be without a functioning Ritter for a couple of weeks, whatever we do.  But stripping Snappie for parts?  It feels like the right choice, but it also feels wrong.”

“You aren’t ready to move into a medium chassis.  Simon left you the Snapdragon for a reason.  Your dad knew what he was doing, Jay,” Savvie said firmly.  She sipped at her white Russian and sighed.  “Humility, ambient jazz, volume two.”  The music began being piped in from the nearby speakers, the smooth, rhythmic noise helping to settle Savvie’s temper.

Jacob’s father had sold off the heavier Ritters he had owned to pay for his son's neurojacking.  Along with pretty much every other asset he’d had beyond the family core and Humility.  Jacob wished he’d rated higher in his father's esteem and been left a heavier chassis, but it was what it was.  He shoved his feelings aside in the same way he’d been trained to ignore the pain of damage to his Ritter.

“I want the Archon made ready.  We can stop at Bayl Station to partially refuel and trade off the beam weapons from the Crab and the Lance.  Then we head to Killie for a proper top-up, so we won’t need to drop for at least a month,”  Jacob said firmly, ignoring the look Savvie shot him.

“A full refuel?  Oh, you’re the best, Jay!” squealed a voice as the hatch opened.  The slender woman rushed across the lounge and threw herself into Jacob’s arms.  “The Burning God will be so happy!” she said as she hugged him tightly.

“Alright, Singing, good to see you too.  It needed doing.  We haven’t fully fueled since…” Jacob began strong and petered out as he tried to avoid the logical conclusion to his sentence.

“Since your father passed the company to you.  Still, it’s fantastic news!  The Reactor will be pleased! There’s a Kindling cathedral on Killie, we should go visit it while we’re there!”  The girl hopped out of Jacob’s lap and went over to the nearby bar to pour herself a glass of wine.  Singing Fury was irrepressible, a whirlwind of positive vibes whenever she was away from her beloved reactor.  However, while tending to her god, she fell into the devoted piety of a member of the Cult of the Burning God.

Her long grey hair swayed as she turned and headed back to the table, taking a seat opposite Jacob.  He winked at her as she took a sip, and she blushed faintly.

“Still a long way from getting my jump drive back,” came a rumbling voice as Coop joined the party.  His face was a dusky red, the bioplastic skin flexing as he grimaced at Jacob.  He had a left arm that ended in a massive three-pronged claw, more forklift than human limb. From it swung a demijohn of his homebrewed moonshine.  

“It will be at least three weeks before the Archon can be considered functional, adn it is unlikely the Protectorate will fit Humility with a jump drive unless Jacob Asgar chooses to sign up with them,” said Harkon as he politely refused an offer of the demijohn with a wave of a blue hand.  Coop shrugged and set the jar on the table.

“I will not be signing up,” Jacob said emphatically.  “I like being my own boss.”

“I can help with the refit, a bit.  Not much else to do until we can afford to refit the old girl,” Coop offered to Harkon.  His right hand, which at a distance would conform to the normal human standard, split apart at the elbow as the cyborg's micromanipulators whirred and danced.  They reformed into something resembling a hand as he caressed the table, sweeping away tiny smears of dirt.  Every part of his beloved ship was worthy of love and respect in Coop’s mind.

“Now that we’re all gathered together, I’d like to propose a toast!  To paydays yet to come!” Jacob had risen to his feet, and he lifted his glass before taking a long pull of his ale and slamming the glass back on the table as he sat back down.  Singing giggled as she took a sip of wine, but Coop scowled at the disrespect to the table.

The lounge was a large room; the bar, located along one side, opened out onto an array of tables and benches intended to accommodate the full crew of a Helen-class assault transport.  That would normally include dozens of technicians and flight teams, plus a marine detachment of a couple of hundred soldiers.  The rest of the space was lost in darkness, the lights only activated over the table occupied by Jacob’s skeleton crew and the bar.

“Jay, we’ve got some time.  This payday will cover us for a few months at normal operating levels, on top of a refuel and refit.”  What Savvie meant was that the Humility wouldn’t be running at a fraction of her potential, as the ship had been for the last two months, and they’d still be wealthy, for a time.  “The next job needs to be right.  I don’t want you rushing into anything, riding the high of a win that wasn’t as clear-cut as you seem to think it was.”

“Ooh, we should go shopping on Bayl.  They’ve got some of the best haberdashers in the system.  It’s been so long since I got a new outfit other than reactor ritual robes.”  Singing adjusted her silky dress, unsubtly highlighting how it clung to her body as she smiled at Jacob.  Savvie snorted, earning a pout from the beautiful young woman.

“If we’re shopping, Humility could do with a new set of secondary power buses.  The shunts we’ve got at the moment are well past their prime.  That’s more important than clothes,” grouched Coop as the Demijohn rose to his artificial mouth, and he took a gurgle that would constitute suicide-by-alcohol in a baseline human.

“There will be some profit from the beam weaponry we have salvaged from Jacob’s fallen foes.  I suggest we keep the Vargo Industries heavy red.  That can be accommodated in the Archon’s left shoulder mount to provide a long-range strike as he closes, but the rest is unsuitable for Jacob Asgar’s combat style,” Harkon said thoughtfully.

“He needs to diversify his skillset,” Savvie added quickly, earning an angry glance from Jacob.  “Charging in to slice away with a cutter is all well and good, but if that fist had been together in one place, or that Lance pilot had known what he was doing, this would be a wake, not a party.”

“I’m not one of those lumbering unjacked idiots, Savvie.  What's the point of plinking away at range when I can close and chop them up?” Jacob slashed a hand through the air a couple of times to mimic his cutter.  “They can’t even fight back once I’m in their face.”

“The point, boy, is one I’m damn sure your old man drilled into that thick skull of yours.  You’ll be better than them at range as well, and not getting close means you won’t get fried if they get an alpha strike off on you.  I watched the logs.  That Crab would have cooked you if he’d gotten a second volley off.   The pilot was good,” Coop snapped.

“I know you served with Dad for a long time, Coop–”

“Thirty-five bloody years, Jacob.  I’ve known you since you were this tall!”  Coop's right forearm split apart as he brought it up, and the various sub-limbs and digits formed a gap about a foot wide.  “I changed your diapers, lad.  You’re good, but you’re not that good, and it’s dangerous work.  I don’t need to cremate you as well before my parts give out.”

“Don’t worry, Coop, I’ve programmed the scutters to salvage all the valuable bits from your body before we cremate you, which will happen long before it’s my turn!” Jacob quipped back, earning a savage smile from the old cyborg.  “How much of you is even human anymore?”

“Just my brain and my danglies, boy.  Feel free to burn those when the time comes.”

Singing Fury rose to her feet with a scowl.  “I’m going to check the tertiary magnetic shield on the core.  If we’re going back to full power soon, it needs to be fiery.  Good evening.”  She turned and strode out through the hatch. 

“Something you said?” Savvie quirked an eyebrow at Jacob as the hatch hissed closed behind Singing Fury.  

He shrugged and drained his ale, wiping the froth from his nose as he put the glass back down.  He couldn’t hide the guilt in his eyes.

“It’s blasphemy to burn a human to her,” Coop chuckled.  “Odd, considering her god is all about fire.”

“‘Only heavy hydrogen is worthy of the flame.’  The Cult is curiously similar to my own pacifist beliefs in that regard,” Harkon offered gently. 

Jacob shifted uncomfortably.  “I’ll have a word with her before we reach Bayl and apologise, I should have known better.  In the meantime… despite how much fun that landing was, I don’t think I’ll try it again.  Slammed that prick into the ground like a tent peg, but damn near broke my ankles,”  He brought his hand down on the table like a hammer hitting a nail.

“You also wrecked twenty grands worth of heatsinks at the same time,” Savvie replied with a sweet smile that made her burn scar writhe on her cheek.  “We shouldn’t go to Bayl.  We can skip the refuel there if we slingshot around Nastor and use Lastor to course correct.  We can be at Killie in two weeks if we burn hard on the decel.  Singing can go without a new outfit till we reach the Protectorate station.”

“I need sugar,” Coop objected.

“You’ve got enough hooch laid in to last you to Killie,” Harkon said.  “I estimate at least thirty litres of one hundred and sixty proof liquor is stored in your cabin.”

“Waa!” Coop gasped.  “You get paid to spy on Jacob, blueboy!”

“I do not get paid to spy on Jacob at all.  I am contractually bound to Resilience and its linked pilot, as were my previous iterations.  That does not mean I am blind to the supply usage aboard this vessel, Gregory Cooper.”

“I still need sugar.  For coffee, if nothing else,” grumbled the cyborg.

“We’ve got enough for a couple of weeks.  Jacob, here’s the astropathing.”  Savvie tapped at her wristpad and sent the file she’d prepared to Jacob’s HUD.  He mentally clicked the icon and tracked the trajectory, noting the fuel expenditure.

“Seven per cent left after decel.  That’s a bit tight?” he queried, raising an eyebrow at the blond woman.

“Well within the margin of error, you know that,” Savvie replied amicably.  ”It’s the right call.” Jacob controlled his wince as her words echoed his thoughts from earlier in the day.  “We’ll get better prices for the salvage there, and we won’t get fucked about by Vargo’s traffic control and admin fees.  They’re probably a mite pissed at us after we stymied their ally’s invasion.”

“They should be called before a tribunal,” said Coop.  “Having the rights to the tethers means they *have* to be neutral in other corpo squabbles.  Something is off there.”

“Maybe they’re xenophiles?  The allure of alien ruins has led many a powerful organisation to rack and ruin in the past.  The site at Patheno in the Harlequin system was the proximal cause of the Galtech-IAP war of 2982,” Harkon said.

“I remember that one.  Proper fucking shit show.  I was serving on the Decadence at the time, an old rust bucket of a Glory-class destroyer.  Captain was a right shit bag too, got half his crew killed when we vented after a railgun salvo got predictably lucky.  Bad days,” Coop muttered.

“You aren’t that old, Coop.  The oldest borg is only a hundred and fifty!” Jacob objected.

“I keep my files clean.  Far as the Proccies are concerned, I’m ninety-seven.”  His red skin twitched into a smirk, the bioplastic wrinkling around the corners of his eyes and mouth.  “They don’t like it known how long some of us cyborgs can linger.”  He lifted the demijohn and took another slug that would have killed his liver if it was still attached.

“How do you even get drunk?” Jacob wondered, asking a question he’d carried since he was a teenager.  “If your only living bits are your brains and your balls… how, and more importantly, why do you insist on making that paint thinner?”

Coop gave him a level look, then winked.  “One of the things you might want to salvage when I finally go is my onboard dialysis machines.  Some of the catalysts I bought when I got them modded are pretty valuable.”  He smirked at Jacob.

“I’ll add them to the insurance policy for the Humility under ‘valuable parts’.” Jacob grinned back at Coop.  “So, do we skip Bayl and head straight to Killie?”

1ox9bf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/1ox9bf0/my_take_on_a2ngp_leader_help/,My Take on A2N/GP Leader. Help.,"As a long-term A2N/Gracepoint member and college ministry staff, I’ve experienced the church’s “leader” culture firsthand. I want to share some thoughts and questions here because inside the church it often feels like an echo chamber, and I obviously can’t discuss any of this with my leader because this is about my relationship with her.

In A2N/GP, everyone has a leader, regardless of age or ministry title. Even a 45 year old pastor with kids reports to a leader above them (and eventually to P Ed/Kelly). The leader is always the same gender and has significant authority over your life. She can comment on or control things like what you wear, who you date or spend time with, where you live or work, and she expects to know what you’re doing at all times. She discourages sharing certain church issues with family members (like my parents) and makes you feel guilty for spending time with people outside of A2N/Gracepoint. She’s also supposed to be your closest friend, yet she gives you labels like “self-absorbed,” “greedy,” or “lazy.” She might take you out for coffee, but she can also slam the table in anger during conversations. I feel constantly anxious around her, like I’m always walking on eggshells, yet she tells me she cares for me, has a vision for my life, and wants to help me grow.

We meet weekly for 1-on-1s to talk about ministry updates, sin struggles, relational conflicts, finances, health, career, marriage, parenting... basically every area of life. I see her every morning for devotions at her house at 7AM, plus multiple times during the week for evening meetings, ministry events, lifegroup fellowship. Outside of that, she texts and emails me throughout the day, sometimes as a friend, sometimes as a mentor, and sometimes as a church leader like, “are you free for a quick chat?” which usually means I’m in trouble. I feel dread whenever I see her name on my phone, because it often means I’m being corrected or given last-minute tasks that I can’t say no to without consequences.

My leader feels like a strange combination of mother, best friend, spiritual authority, and life coach. I respect her because she’s older and supposedly wiser, but I also feel stressed, anxious, and unsettled around her. Her reactions are unpredictable. Sometimes I want to leave the church to escape this, but I feel guilty even thinking about it. When I try to bring up past hurtful comments from her, she claims she doesn’t remember or insists that I was actually the problem. It’s confusing... I don’t know if I love or resent her. She can be caring, but she can also be frightening. A part of me feels like I must be the issue, like my immaturity and incompetency somehow causes her to act this way.

She encourages me to share my deepest secrets, sins, and marriage struggles with her, while discouraging me from sharing those things with my husband. She says talking to him too much would “burden him” and ""slow him down in ministry"". She even warns us about praying too much or just spending time at home together as a married couple. I’m struggling to understand whether this is biblical. Isn’t my spouse supposed to be my closest partner in life? How exactly does my leader fit into my marriage, especially when my husband also has a leader?

In college ministry, we’ve stopped using the term “leader” because it sounds strange to students, so we call ourselves “mentors” or “life coaches.” But the behavior and expectations are the same. As a mentor, I’m already texting college students constantly, weekly check-ins, inviting them to events, asking them to volunteer for events… and I know it only intensifies over time. They have no idea what this dynamic eventually becomes.

My question is: Is this kind of relationship with a church leader normal or healthy? Does this happen in churches outside of A2N/GP? Do your church leaders interact with you this way?",4,1763156166.0,GracepointChurch,5,1.0,False

1ox9ang,https://i.redd.it/oqcmat6dka1g1.jpeg,17 Pro Max 26.1 battery (disappointment?),"Hi all,

I wanted to share with you with my iPhone battery paranoia story. Take a tea or coffee, sit down comfortably and read what my experience is.

I started to pay attention to the battery performance when I got iPhone 14 Pro a few years back. But at the time I assumed that a low performance is caused by the way I use my phone. 

Last year I’ve got 16 Pro. After first month I realized that my battery performance was much lower than other users here or people around me. I’ve been seeing 7-9h SoT screenshots with 20-30% battery left. My battery performance was at around 4-6h SoT.  Never more. At some point this year I realized that there is no way I could not recharge my phone over the day. 

What did I do? I replaced the 16 Pro unit 2-3 times during the first month of using. I even had 16 Pro Max for week or two - my SoT was 6-7h at the best. And my 16 Pro Mas was from T-Mobile and all 16 Pro units directly from Apple.com.  

I live in Poland so the only way to contact Apple is via phone or Authorized Service Points. I had several conversations with them. They performed diagnostics on my 2 units (remotely and the first unit when I bought the phone for the first time and the second unit after the replacement via the seller - new sealed device). No issues found. Ok I accepted that. Two weeks ago I sent my phone to Apple (official service in Prague) and the next day they returned my device stating that no issues were found. Ok. Accepted it again. And then I decided to switch to 17 Pro Max. 

I configured my 17PM on 2.11 (today is 14.11 so 12 full days) and the best battery performance was one week ago: 7h SoT and 25% battery left. 

But what I am observing, my battery can offer me realistically 4h SoT with 50% battery left. 2 days scenario would be an extremely uncomfortable option. 

So I went the the authorized service nearby and they conducted all tests claiming that everything is ok. No errors, no faulty parts. Apple support told me via phone the same. 

Here are my settings:

- Always on Display: off
- 5G: off 
- LTE: low mode
- Apple Intelligence: off (not available in Poland)
- Hey Siri: off
- press button to activate Siri: off
- background apps refresh: off
- rise to wake up: off
- auto brightens: on
- the same problem was with iOS 18 and 26.1. I tested reduced transparency - no benefits of this change. 

Each time I configured the phone as a new one without restoring from a backup (logged in via iCloud, installed all apps manually). In case of 16 Pro I have even installed iOS 18.x from DFU mode. Nothing helped. 

So what I did today was I turned off the cellular signal (airplane mode + WiFi) because despite the fact that I live in the city center (literally) my cellular signal is 1 bar or sometimes 0, sometimes 2 bars. 

And you know what? 

I have almost 5h SoT and 67% battery left. Great! But…

I see many screenshots here where people have such great battery performance with 1-2 cellular bars and sometimes using phone with LTE only. I am asking: how? 

What I am doing wrong or what other setting may causing such worse battery performance than presented by some users here? 

I am not a heavy user. I mostly use TikTok, Apple Music and Podcasts (and AirPods), instagram, Google App or safari. I am avoiding camera or CapCut just to keep stats clear during the testing period. 

Attached screen shows my battery yesterday: I spent 8h at home with WiFi and very weak cellular signal plus I was outside for 2h with LTE only. 

It is not possible to have 3-4 units, produced during a different periods, different models and blame hardware. It must be something in the software or with the signal strength. What do you think?",1,1763156117.0,iPhoneBatteryParanoia,2,0.67,False

I assume surviving vegans have all come across accommodating chains such as Your Pie, Taco Bell, and Mellow Mushroom so I won't mention them.  
  
**Downtown Macon/Ingleside Village:**  
Tropical Flava - 2396 Ingleside Ave, Macon, GA 31204  
Caribbean vegan dishes like their Jerk Tofu are amazing. Nice owners.  
  
Macon Bagels - 470 3rd St, Macon, GA 31201  
This is a weekly stop by for us during our morning walks. Their staple vegan sandwich is the Captain Planet, which is vegan sausage, vegan cheese, avocado, and sundried tomato/garlic spread. They also have vegan cold brew slushies and vegan focaccia bread on occasion. Can't recommend enough.  
  
Piedmont Brewery and Kitchen - 450-B 3rd St, Macon, GA 31201  
I'm a simple man , and I can appreciate when a simple beyond burger is done right. If you need a quick downtown meal before an event in the area. You can't go wrong here.  
  
Village Coffee - 2391 Ingleside Ave, Macon, GA 31204  
Favorite coffee shop in town, and we have a lot of coffee options as Maconites. Good coffee and vegan pastries last time we went.  
  
Gangnam Grill - 575 Mulberry St Ln, Macon, GA 31201  
A personalized BiBimBap with perfect tasting tofu alongside their vegan ponzu sauce and the rest of the fixings. So good.  
  
La Bella Morelia - 524 Mulberry St, Macon, GA 31201  
Best authentic Mexican in town. Outside of the obvious dishes that you can imagine can be made vegan, there are Tortas that can be made vegan that are delicious.  
  
Hello Boba Cafe - 359 3rd St, Macon, GA 31201  
Listen. It is good boba, and the owners are nice and accommodating. A little jarring if you are not an anime fan, but it is worth it, I promise.  
  
**South Macon/Byron:**  
Hong Kong Garden - 3045 Hartley Bridge Rd # E, Macon, GA 31216  
Everyone has their favorite Chinese pick up place and this is ours. Fantastic owners, great flavor, and very generous portion sizes.  
  
Crooklyn Roots - 100 Hamilton Pointe Dr #155, Byron, GA 31008  
We admittedly have not tried them under this new name, but vegan Jamaican food is hard to come by around here. try em.  
  
Verus Vine Plant Based Kitchen - 100 Hamilton Pointe Dr Unit 145, Byron, GA 31008  
COMPLETELY VEGAN - THIS IS NOT A DRILL. Guys. It is so important to support businesses like this with our cause in particular. It also happens to be incredibly delicious.  
  
Sweet Rain Vegan Bake Shop - 6717 Hawkinsville Rd Macon, Ga 31216 (Inside Smiley's Flea Market)  
COMPLETELY VEGAN - THIS IS ALSO NOT A DRILL. These owners are the real deal, guys. Passionate vegans that also have a knack for baking insanely good cakes and other baked goods. If you ain't picking up some soon, you are doing yourself a disservice.  
  
**North Macon:**  
Medi's Mediterranean Fusion Restaurant - 1687 Bass Road, 103 PINNACLE POINT, Macon, GA 31210  
Owners are very nice. They have vegan falafel wraps and desserts like baklava.  
  
Pho Saigon - 3076 Riverside Dr, Macon, GA 31210  
Tofu spring rolls and tofu banh mi are amazing. Pho is good as well.  
  
Chico and Chang - 3850 Riverside Dr, Macon, GA 31210  
Asian-Mexican fusion with vegan substitutions for most meals.  
  
**West Macon:**  
Guitarras Mexican Express - 5577 Thomaston Rd #500, Macon, GA 31220  
Giant burrito that can be made vegan called the Big Veggie. Nuff said.  
  
Bombay Curry - 3892 Bloomfield Village Dr, Macon, GA 31206  
I know most Indian places can accommodate us, but the flavor of these dishes compared to other Indian restaurants in the area is unmatched. We recommend the Vegetable Hakka Noodles and Chana Masala.  
  
**Warner Robins/Forsyth:**  
Bonzu Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi - 22 W Main St, Forsyth, GA 31029  
Creamy Vegan Ramen....   
  
Zaaps - 670 Lake Joy Rd, Kathleen, GA 31047  
Are there other Thai restaurants in Warner Robins that are accommodating to vegans? yes. Are they Zaaps? no, unfortunately. Listen, just take a bite and realize this is the best Thai place in Middle Georgia. Specifically, we get the Garlic Chives Dumplings, Pad Cody's, and Spicy Zaap's Fried Rice.  
  
Chois - 423 N Commercial Cir, Warner Robins, GA 31093  
No, not a restaurant. It's an Asian grocery store that has most of the ingredients you would need for any Asian vegan dish you would make at home.  
  
Cinnaholic - 810 SR 96 Ste 1100, Warner Robins, GA 31088  
Completely vegan bakery known for their loaded cinnamon rolls. Yes, its a chain, but it is the only one anywhere near Middle Georgia. While my wife and I have had mixed experiences with them at this location, it is good to know it exists. \*Psst\* I'd say go to Sweet Rain Vegan Bake Shop instead for your vegan bake fix.  
  
If you somehow made it all the way through this, lemme know any hidden gems you may have found or any good experiences you have had at any of these places if ya got em. In a world and area that is primarily comprised of omnivores, it is good to recognize those who would have and support us even indirectly.",7,1763155883.0,macon,1,1.0,False

If you’re 18+ and friendly, let’s keep it low-pressure: public meetup, coffee, park walk, or browsing a bookstore. I’m flexible around Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Akron, or Toledo and can do daytime or evenings. Comment age, city, two things you’d like to do, and weekend availability.

They called me a wife. But treated me like a ghost.
I cooked. I cleaned. I stayed silent.
For years, I folded myself small just to fit into their perfect little world.
Until one dinner shattered it all.
A child’s innocent wish. A cruel accusation.
And a betrayal so deep, it cracked something in me that would never heal.
When the man who vowed to protect me raised his hand instead…
I knew—I had to go.
So I took the card he tossed at me like a bone thrown to a dog…
And I vanished.
Now his calls won’t stop.
But I know why.
It’s not love he misses.
It’s his maid. His cleaner. His obedient, broken doll.
Too late, Ethan.
I’m not yours anymore.
I've been married to Ethan for seven years. Seven years of waking early to pack his lunches, ironing his shirts, making sure dinner was always hot when he came home. I forgot who I was before I became his wife. His mother's maid and his daughter's ghost.
Today I made a mistake.
I thought to myself, it was finally time to feel alive and feel truly married. So I turned to Ethan and asked him about our anniversary.
 
I asked him if we could celebrate our anniversary with a small dinner. Just us.
“Dinner?” He didn’t look up from his laptop. “What for?”
I paused, uncertain. “It’s been seven  years. I just thought—maybe somewhere quiet. I already checked the menu at—”
He waved a hand. “Enough. You think we have money for that kind of nonsense? You want me to waste cash so you can pretend you're someone else for one night?”
I opened my mouth, but the words sat like stones on my tongue.
“You don’t even contribute,” he said, shaking his head. “You sit in this house all day. The least you could do is not spend what little I bring in.”
""I didn’t mean—""
He slammed the laptop shut. ""You never do. But here we are.""
My hands trembled, but I forced myself to smile. “I can cook. Maybe just something special tonight?” The tears formed in my eyes as I spoke, wishing he could at least give my idea a chance, but his next words broke my heart further.
He scoffed. “Special? Since when do you make anything special? Every day it’s the same bland food. I only eat it because I’m too tired to complain.”
The door creaked open behind us.
“I heard shouting,” his mother’s voice sliced through the hallway. “What has she done this time?”
“She wants a fancy dinner for our anniversary,” Ethan said dryly. “Like we’re in some fairytale.”
His mother clicked her tongue as she stepped into the room. “Are you serious, Avery? Have you looked in the mirror lately? You want a dinner? How about you lose some weight first?”
I shrank back, but she wasn’t finished.
“My son would have married that girl from his college. The one with the business degree. Remember her, Ethan? Anna. Pretty. Sharp. Her parents owned a chain of clinics. You chose... this.”
Ethan chuckled.
“I was young,” he said. “Didn’t think straight.”
I stood up, feeling the sting creep behind my eyes. “I was just trying to do something nice. For us.” I whimpered, wishing I never said anything in the first place.
His mother scoffed. “Nice? Then clean this place properly. There’s dust on the hallway shelf. That’s what you’re good for.”
I clenched my fists. “I clean every day.” 
“Clearly not well enough,” she snapped. “And look at your clothes. Who wears that kind of thing at home? You should be embarrassed.”
I backed away, heart pounding.
What else did I have to wear? If not for this same rag she was talking about. Her son made sure I lived like a maid in my own matrimonial home and now I'm being blamed, when I was not being taken care of.  I knocked over the vase near the table. It shattered on the floor, pieces skittering across the tiles.
Ethan swore under his breath. “Are you serious, Avery?”
“I—I didn’t mean to—”
“Of course you didn’t. You never mean to. But you still ruin everything.”
I dropped to my knees, hands fumbling to pick up the shards. One piece cut into my finger, drawing blood. I didn’t stop. I kept collecting.
Neither of them moved.
“Maybe if Anna had been your wife,” his mother said coldly, “she wouldn’t be crawling on the floor like a dog right now.”
I bit my lip so hard I tasted iron. My vision blurred, but I blinked fast. I wouldn’t give them tears.
Later, I made dinner in silence. His favorite—stir-fried prawns with garlic rice. I served it quietly, setting the plate before him like always. Waiting patiently for his reaction. I stood like a murderer about to be hanged to death, I stood like I was just a mere servant standing before the king.
He took one bite and pushed it away.
“Tastes like cardboard.”

Chapter 2

I stood there, watching Ethan push the plate away like it was something filthy.
“You didn’t even try,” he said. “This is the worst garlic rice I’ve ever had. Are you punishing me or just lazy?”
I swallowed hard. My hands gripped the edge of the table. Why does Ethan have to be so hard? Why does he treat me this way? 
“I—I’ll make something else,” I said quickly, trying to lift the plate.
He slammed his fork down. “Don’t bother. You’ve been in the kitchen all day and this is what you made? You had one job, Avery. One.”
The tears welled up in my eyes.
Not the grocery lists. Not the scrubbing. Not the hours spent packing his lunches just right or hemming the clothes his mother said were “too cheap.” Not the years I gave up my own dreams to raise a daughter who now barely calls me mom. One job. Like I was born to serve and still couldn’t get that right.
I blinked fast as my vision blurred. I didn’t want them to see. I didn’t want to cry—not again.
“I’ll fix it,” I whispered. “I just forgot the salt.”
My mother-in-law suddenly barged in, a sweet feminine smell that made my stomach churned followed her. 
Then I saw her– Anna, the perfect one that has always been compared to me. The one that was supposed to be Ethan's choice, his perfect choice walking behind her triumphantly.
The golden one.
The one their mother always said was “how a woman should be.” The one who acted and looked rich, had two nannies, and showed up only when it was convenient—usually to show me how much more she was.
“Hello everyone!” She waved her hand and I saw the expensive bracelet she wore. The exact type I had told Ethan, a few days ago, that I wanted. Instead, he had gotten it for her, and even made her wear it to spite me the more.
“I just dropped off the gift for Mom’s retirement,” she said, flashing a Rolls Royce car key in my face. “Mom deserves just the best.”
Their mother perked up immediately. “Oh, Anna, you shouldn’t have! Let me see it!”
“It’s just a Rolls Royce,” she said with a little laugh. “But I thought it was time she drove something real.”
Ethan chuckled and stood to greet her. “You’re spoiling her.”
I stayed where I was, holding the ruined dinner in my hands, watching the scene unfold before me with blurry eyes.
Anna’s eyes landed on me. “Avery, you okay?”
Before I could answer, their mother sighed loudly. “She messed up dinner again. We were just about to order out.”
Anna didn’t miss a beat. “Great! I’ve been craving that new Italian place anyway. My treat. To celebrate Mom.”
Ethan nodded. “That sounds perfect. Let’s go. I’ll drive.”
Then he turned toward me and said it so casually, it nearly knocked the air from my lungs: “You stay here. You can finish this if you want.”
I blinked. “I—”
“She doesn’t like eating out,” his mother cut in. “Too noisy, too expensive. Isn’t that right, Avery?”
I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. The cruelty had left me speechless and I just stood there.
They were already heading to the door. Ethan didn’t even glance back.
They left laughing, voices trailing into the night.
I stood alone in the dining room, holding a plate no one would eat. The food was still warm, but everything inside me felt cold.
I sat down, picked up a fork, and forced myself to chew.
It was bland.
Too much garlic, not enough heart.
But that wasn’t why I couldn’t taste anything.
I looked around this house I’ve cleaned a thousand times. The curtains I sewed. The chairs I polished. The birthdays I hosted with handmade decorations. The nights I stayed awake waiting for Ethan to come home, pretending not to smell the perfume on his collar.
But what did it amount to?
I wasn’t a wife. Not really. I never was.
I was a fixture. A mute background. Their plaything.
The tears came quietly this time. No drama. Just soft, endless drops falling onto my untouched plate.
I washed the dishes. I swept the floor. I folded the napkins just the way his mother liked them.
Then I went upstairs and stood in front of the mirror.
I stared at the woman looking back—tired eyes, stained apron, a smear of sauce on her sleeve.
I whispered to her, “You used to be someone.”
And maybe—just maybe—she still was.

Chapter 3

I woke up to the soft creak of the door.
Not the front one—this one came from the study. I sat up, heart thudding. Ethan had returned late last night, but I hadn’t heard him come to bed. I tiptoed across the hallway and peered in.
There he was. Standing close to Anna, her laugh low and warm like a song only he could hear.
She held one of the ties I had ironed yesterday, sliding it gently around his neck. He didn’t pull away. He leaned in.
They didn’t see me.
I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I just stood there, like a ghost in my own home, while my husband let another woman wrap his tie like it was hers to fix.
It had been folded neatly on my side of the closet. I had planned to wear it today since the foreign investors in Ethan's company  were coming and I needed to create a great impression. It was the last thing I bought before Ethan stopped giving me ""personal"" expenses.
I walked into the kitchen where Anna stood by the sink, sipping coffee from the mug with the rose print. My mug.
And there she was, laughing, swirling a spoon in her coffee, radiant in it. The fabric clung to her perfectly, clinched at the waist, just as I had imagined it on myself.
The one I had hidden in the back of the closet. The one I bought with the last of my flower money—the money I saved over three years without touching a cent from Ethan. It was my dress. My secret splurge. I had never worn it, not even once.
My breath caught in my throat. I stepped forward. “Anna,” I said, voice tighter than I intended, “where did you get that dress?”
She turned, smiling like she hadn’t heard the tension. “Oh, this?” She looked down at herself with a little twirl. “It was just hanging there. I thought it was new and… unworn. Ethan said I could take it.”
My heart dropped. “He gave it to you?”
“Yeah.” She shrugged. “He said it didn’t look like something you’d wear anyway.”
The corners of her lips lifted. Not in apology. In amusement.
“Oh,” she added, gesturing to the table, “Ethan said to make sure you prepared something nice for tonight. He’s hosting the investors here. We want the place to look perfect. You understand.”
We.
I nodded.
I didn’t respond. I turned and walked away, locking myself in the laundry room.
Inside, I pressed my palms against the washer’s cold surface, steadying my breath.
That dress was mine.
I’d watered those damn marigolds in the sun, clipped roses with blistered hands, braided tiny bouquets with twine and ribbon, and sold them at the corner market in the summer heat. Three years of saving. For one moment. One thing that was just for me.
And now… now she wore it like a trophy.
____
You know you weren’t supposed to do that, right?” I stormed into the study, the rage choking in my throat. Ethan looked up, startled.
He was adjusting his collar, fingers brushing where Anna’s hands had just been.
“What are you talking about?” he said, voice calm, too calm.
“The dress,” I snapped. “The crimson one I kept in the back of the closet. You told her she could wear it?”
His brows knit together in mock confusion. “It was just a dress, Avery.”
“No. It was mine. I bought it with my own money. You knew that.”
“Your money?” He scoffed, stepping away like the conversation was beneath him. “Don’t start this again.”
I clenched my fists. “It was the last thing I bought before you cut off my allowance, Ethan. You think I didn’t notice when you started ‘reallocating’ funds? When you said I didn’t need extras? That everything should go toward the household?”
“You don’t work, Avery,” he said flatly. “Everything in this house is bought with my money. You act like I owe you luxuries when you contribute nothing.”
Nothing.
The word hit me like a slap.
I had raised his daughter. Cooked his meals. Smiled in front of his family. Nursed his sick mother. I had spent seven years holding this family together, and now I was ‘nothing.’
He adjusted his watch, already done with the conversation. “Don’t make a scene,” he muttered. “We have the investor event today. Just stay upstairs if you’re upset.”
Investor event.
Right. The one I had helped prepare for all week. The guest list, the table settings, the menus. He had handed it all to Anna last night without a word, acting like it had always been her show to run.
That evening, the house buzzed with unfamiliar voices. Suits. Champagne. Laughter echoing through the hall.
I stayed back, like he asked. Watched from the staircase as Anna floated through the crowd, graceful and smiling.
That night, I cooked the dishes I knew they loved. Set the table with the china I was only allowed to use on special occasions. Dressed in a plain blouse, the closest thing I could find to decent after the one I had prepared was destroyed.
Ethan didn’t notice.
He came home with a dozen guests trailing behind him, Anna clinging to his side like the hostess of this house. Everyone greeted her warmly, laughed at her jokes, complimented her earrings.
No one saw me.
I poured the wine. Served the food. Smiled like a waitress trying to earn tips.
At the end of the night, one of the guests, a kind-eyed older man, turned to me and said, “You must be the maid. You’re quite good at this.”
Before I could respond, Anna chuckled and leaned in. “Oh, she’s more than that. Avery takes care of everything here. She’s like… family.”
That word. Family. As if it was supposed to comfort me. As if it didn’t burn.
And then I heard it.
From the far end of the room, Ethan raised his glass and said, “I want to thank everyone here for believing in our vision. And I’d like to take a moment to recognize someone very special.”
He turned, extending a hand.
My heart raced in excitement. This is finally my moment, I muttered to myself as I took a step forward, waiting for my name to be called. I wiped my hand over my apron excitedly, stretching my neck to have a closer look at Ethan who didn't smile at my direction. 
“To the woman who’s helped me through every challenge, who’s stood by me during the darkest times. My partner in every way—Anna.”
Partner.
Anna stepped forward, cheeks flushed with pride. There was a pause. A smile. Then he added, “And as of this week, my fiancée.”
I didn’t hear the applause.
I didn’t hear the cheers or the clinking glasses.
Just the sound of my own breath catching in my throat.
Fiancée.
My vision blurred, but I couldn’t look away. I squeezed the ends of my apron as hot tears formed behind my eyes. Why Ethan? Why?
He hadn’t just erased me. He had rewritten me—as if I never existed. As if I was just a caretaker who had outlived her use.
I backed away from the stair rail, hands trembling. Upstairs, everything felt too loud. The music. The laughter. The betrayal.
I allowed the tears to fall, soaking my chest. In front of everyone, Ethan denied me. Placed Anna above me like he'd always done. Made a fool out of me. 
I sat on the bed and opened my drawer. Inside was the folder I had hidden months ago—divorce papers I never signed.
Until now.

Chapter 4

“Avery, my beautiful moon,” he had said, the night before we had the low-key wedding which had just his family and a few friends. “Your face radiating like the full moon. You're such wife material and I'm so glad you finally choose to accept me and my daughter. I'll treat you right and never leave your side. You're such a great woman and I'm glad you came into my life.” 
I trusted his words—blindly, foolishly. I agreed to our marriage being made official with nothing more than his family, a few friends and his daughter—Mayisha. No wedding ring, no guests, no celebration. Just a cold signature and a vow I clung to like gospel. I was deeply, hopelessly in love. But now I understand—he never truly picked me. I wasn’t his first choice. I was simply the backup plan, the convenient option when Anna refused to be there for him.
The next day, despite my tiredness and shattered heart, And after making breakfast and lunch, it was finally evening and the whole family was around.
Dinner was served in polished silence, broken only by the soft clinking of cutlery against the plates. I sat at the far end of the table, the rejected cornerstone, my hands folded neatly in my lap, my gaze trained on the little girl across from me—Mayisha, my stepdaughter. The girl giggled as I spooned rice onto her plate, tucking a stray curl behind her ear like I was already used to mothering her.
Ethan watched with a soft smile, pride flickering in his eyes. Not for me. Never for me. 
Mayisha looked up, eyes bright and innocent, her voice cutting through the tense quiet dining area like a knife.
""Daddy, I wish Miss Anna was your wife. She's so pretty and fun. She smells like cake."" 
I froze. Ethan blinked. 
I waited for him to say something, to say those words I've been dying to hear. To reprimand her and say I was his wife, but instead, he kept mute.
He said nothing.
Anna laughed, high and melodic. ""Oh, sweetheart, that's such a sweet thing to say.""
There was a pause. Then Ethan's mother leaned forward, her smile tight. ""Children say the darndest things, don't they? But they also speak from the heart."" Her voice dripped with malice and mockery.
My throat tightened. My spoon clattered softly against the plate as I reached for the water I didn't need.
""You know,"" Madam Elsa, Ethan's mother continued, turning her gaze towards me, ""Anna would've been the perfect wife for Ethan. Such poise. Such charm. But not everyone is strong enough to step into a ready-made family, right?""
I swallowed my hurt like glass. ""I tried—"" I began softly.
""You tried,"" she interrupted, waving a dismissive hand. ""Trying isn't always enough, dear. Ethan needed someone who could shine beside him.""
And as if on cue, Ethan reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a velvet box.
I stilled.
Anna's smile widened.
""I saw this and thought of you,"" he said, opening it with a flourish. A diamond bracelet shimmered in the candlelight, catching the glow just right. ""You've always said you love diamonds. I hope this matches your taste.""
He got up, walked past me without a glance , and gently clasped the bracelet, which must have cost a fortune  around Anna's wrist.
I looked away, my chest rising and falling with quiet betrayal. The same kind of betrayal that never roared— just bled silently.
Anna cooed, admiring the sparkle. ""It's beautiful. Thank you, Ethan.""
Mayisha clapped. ""It's like a princess bracelet. Miss Anna, will you be my mummy?""
I pushed my chair back. The scraping sound drew eyes, but no concern. 
I walked into the kitchen, the hum of the dishwasher the only noise in the silence I carried. My fingers curled around the edge of the sink as memory crashed in— unwelcome, uninvited.
That night. The investor party.
I'd worn the soft blue silk dress Ethan never noticed. Had styled my hair for once, even put on a touch of lipstick. I had hoped—stupidly hoped—that maybe, he'd see me.
But it was Anna on his arm. And when one of the guests raised a glass to toast ""The happy couple,"" Ethan didn't correct them. Not even when I had confronted him after introducing her as his fiancée.
He smiled.
""Ethan,"" I'd whispered afterward, pulling him aside near the hallway, trembling. ""Did you... Did you just let them think she's your fiance?""
He didn't flinch. ""It's just for the investors. Avery. They like her image. She fits what they expect.""
""But I'm your wife.""
""On paper,"" he said coolly. ""I needed someone they'd respect. Someone who looks the party. Don't start being paranoid and dramatic. You know what this was.""
I stood there, staring at him like he was a stranger.
He had never chosen me. I was just the caretaker— the one that looked after his daughter when her mother died during her birth. The same girl now rejects me and wishes someone else was her mother. 
I grilled the edge of the counter, eyes burning. 
They were laughing in the dining room again.
Anna's voice rang out, mayisha'e giggle followed. My family. My husband. My stepdaughter. All woven around a woman who was never willing to love them until it was convenient.
The bracelet sparkles on Anna's wrist. The same wrist that once pushed me aside at the party, the same one that now wore Ethan's affection like a crown.
I looked down at my bare hand. The one without a ring. He'd never given me one.
A sob clawed up my throat, raw and stifled. I pressed my fist to my lips.
Not because I wanted luxury. Not because I wanted diamonds .
But because I had poured everything into this home—love, time, care— and all of it had vanished, swallowed by shadows.
And the worst part? No one even noticed I was breaking.
I swallowed the burning lump in my throat and forced a smile, pretending the words hadn't just scraped my heart raw.
Back there, when I stood up, my appetite was long gone, so I had to excuse myself to the kitchen. My legs moved fast, like they were trying to outrun the sting in my chest. I grabbed the sink for balance, my knuckles turning white as memories flood in—nights rocking a crying baby, fevered foreheads wiped with cool clothes, bedtime lullabies sung through exhaustion. 
Yet, all Mayisha wants is Anna.
Tears blurred my vision as I opened the cabinet for water, but before I could calm myself, Ethan stormed in.

Chapter 5

He slammed the door behind him. ""What the hell was that?""
I flinched. ""What... What are you talking about?""
""There was a pin in the food, Avery. A damn pin!"" His voice rose, venom laced in each word.
""It could've hurt Anna. Were you trying to poison her?""
My mouths parted in disbelief. ""What? No— Ethan, I didn't— ""
""Save it,"" he snaps. ""Don't let your jealousy turn you into a killer.""
The slap landed before I could process the rage in his eyes. My face whipped to the side. The sting burned instantly.
I gasped, stumbling slightly, my cheek throbbing. ""I would never hurt anyone."" 
""You'd better not,"" he grows. ""Because if something happens to Anna because of you, I won't be this merciful.""
He stormed out, leaving me in the cold echo of the kitchen.
I held my cheeks, trembling. The tears won't fall. Not yet. I grabbed the counter, trying to breathe. My heart was heavy, but my eyes remained dry. Numbness began to settle in place of pain.
___
Later, I wiped the floor,quiet and robotic when Anna walked in— heels clicking like applause.
""Oh dear,"" she said with a mock-pity smile. ""You're still cleaning?""
I didn't respond 
Anna kneeled slightly, voice laced with sweetness.
""Sorry about earlier. I told Ethan not to be too harsh, but you know how he gets when he's worried about me.""
I did not look up.
""I mean... A pin in the food? That's dangerous, don't you think?"" Anna tilted her head, smirking. ""You should really be more careful.""
I clenched the rag tighter. My hands ached. My knees burned. My pride? Long buried.
""Such drama over a small mistake,"" Ethan's mother chimed in, entering the room. ""Back in my day, women knew how to cook without injuring the guests. Maybe if you weren't so distracted, you'd do your job properly.""
Still, I said nothing. I kept on scrubbing. 
They left me there—like they always do— basking in their casual cruelty.
Then came the sound of hurried feet.""Anna?"" Ethan's mother yelled. ""Are you okay?""
A gag echoes from the bathroom.
I stood still.
They all rushed in, hovering, fussing.
I am alone again.
I turned to wipe the counter and noticed Anna's purse lying there, wide open. Something white and plastic poked out.
I shouldn't look
But I did.
My fingers pulled it free: a positive pregnancy test. Underneath it, a folded clinic result.
Pregnant. Eight weeks.
My hands shook.
I pulled out Anna's phone— unlocked. My stomach twisted as I scrolled.
Ethan: ""I'm so happy, love. This baby... It's everything. You're everything. Unlike Avery— just a placeholder. You? You're my future.""
I swallowed a cry. My throat tightened.
So this is what he meant. Why he had turned cold. Why he slapped me? Anna was carrying his child— and  I am disposable now.
The pin in the food. The slap. The cruel silence. It all made sense now. I'd been working non-stop, preparing everything, and they still found a way to blame me.
And he never wanted a child with me. He'd said it once. Casually. Like a joke.
""You? You're not the kind of woman I see myself raising kids with.""
My fingers tremble as I tuck everything back into the purse before they return.
I smoothen the counter like nothing ever happened.
But something had.
Something inside me had cracked wide open.
___
By morning, they were all dressed to leave for a family function. I watched as Anna beamed as Ethan helped her down the stairs 
He walked up to me, tossing a card in my direction. ""Buy yourself something nice. But don't be ridiculous with it.""
The card fell to the floor near my feet.
I stared at it.
Not at him.
Slowly, I bent, picked it up with trembling hands. Not from fear— but from the weight of realization.
I nodded, my expression unreadable. ""Of course.""
Ethan turned, already distracted by Anna's glow.
I walked back inside. The card clenched tightly in my hand.
I don't cry.
I don't feel rage.
I just stared at the silver shine of the card, a ghost smile forming in my lips.
Not because I was grateful.
But because I had a plan.
And this time, it wasn't for them.

Chapter 6

The house had gone quiet after the chaos of their departure. But silence didn't mean peace.
I sat on the edge of the bed, my eyes distant. The memory played on loop: Anna giggling as she walked out of the master bedroom that morning, wearing Ethan's shirt, her hair tousled, her skin glowing.
Our bed.
The same bed Ethan and forbidden me from entering four years ago, saying he needed space, that my presence suffocated him.
I remembered how I used to curl up on the couch in the guest room, clutching my pillow while listening to his footsteps fade away upstairs. And now— Anna walked those same steps, slept on those same sheets, untouched by shame.
My fingers curled around the black card he'd thrown at me like it was a bone for a starving dog. His voice echoed cruelly in my ears: ""Get anything you want. But don't go crazy.""
That was it.
Hurt me, and after that try to get me things that I have been starved for just to compensate me, or what?
My grip tightened.
Enough!!!
I rose, walked to the bathroom and turned on the shower. Steam fogged the mirror as I stepped in, letting the water wash away the filth of years— of rejection, of pain, of pretending.
When I stepped out, I was no longer the same Avery.
I dressed in a soft crimson body con dress that hugged my gentle curves like it was made just for me. My waist, once hidden behind loose aprons and faded sweaters, now defined like sculpture. I applied a foundation that melted into my skin, a glow radiating from high cheekbones he once told me were ""too sharp."" My almond eyes were lined in gold, my lips painted a deep, confident red. My long black hair cascaded over my shoulders in soft waves— thick, luxurious, gleaming. Ethan had once told me to stop using my ""cheap"" hair oil— it smelled ""too local."" Not, I smelled of roses, musk, and liberation.
This was the version of Avery he had tried to bury, but today, I exhumed myself.
I stepped into the garage, selected one of Ethan's sleek cars— silver, clean, powerful. The kind he said wasn't ""safe"" for me to drive. I slipped into the driver's seat and turned on the ignition without hesitation.
Before I backed out, I turned off my phone.
I didn't need interruptions. Not today.
The shopping mall glistened under the noon sun, its glass walls reflecting a world of luxury— one I'd only ever watched from afar.
But today, I entered.
From boutique to boutique, I didn't hesitate. I walked past the ""Sake"" section and straight into the heart of the stores. 
I tried on flowing silk dresses, fitted suits, leather jackets, designer heels that clicked proudly against polished floors. I bought perfumes in crystal bottles, bags with gold-etched logos, lingerie that whispered elegance.
I had lived in rags while Ethan pampered Anna in pearls.
No more.
My arms were full of shopping bags by the time I finished, my steps light. I didn't glance at the debit alerts Ethan must be getting — I imagined his phone buzzing incessantly, his face tightening in panic.
At the family function, Ethan's phone vibrated again and again.
Debit Alert: -$5999
Debit Alert: -$987
Debit Alert: -$10000
""What the hell..."" He muttered, his face paling.
Anna leaned over. ""Everything okay?""
He stood abruptly, dialing Avery's number. 
Straight to voicemail. Again. Again.
""Where the hell is she?"" He growled.
Back at the house, I returned home like a storm.
I dumped the old rags in a trash bag. The clothes that once made me ashamed to leave the house, the torn slippers, the faded apron— gone. Replaced with silks and satins, with shoes that made me feel like I had roots and wings at the same time.
I walked into the master bedroom— his room and placed the black card on his pillow.
And then I reached under the drawer. The documents were still there.
The divorce papers.
The ones he'd use to threaten me countless times. ""One wrong step, and I'll make you sign it. You'll be nothing.""
Not today.
I picked up the pen and signed my name.
With a steady and.
I folded the papers and placed them neatly beside the card on the bed.
I gathered my new things, zipped my suitcase, and dragged it down the steps..my heart didn't pound. My body didn't tremble. I was calm.
At the door, I paused.
I pulled out my phone, turned it on.
34 missed calls. Ethan.
""What a jerk!"" I scoffed and stepped outside 
A cab waited at the curb. I placed my bag in the truck and slipped into the back seat.
“Rose Villa,"" I said quietly.
What Ethan didn't know even after cutting off my expenses was that I was secretly writing, freelancing and earning money which I was saving for moments like this.
The vacation I had always wanted, I was going for it.
The new area buzzed with strangers. 
I stood by the large window near the estate gate, my phone held steady.
One final photo.
My head held high, my lips curved in a gentle smile. Behind me, the estate board blinked with lights and directions to new homes, new lives.
I added a caption.
""Cheers to a new life.""
And posted it.
Then I turned.
And walked towards the gate without looking back.

“Joppie Runs for President!”

A vibrant, cinematic photorealistic picture with vibrant colours of a campaign rally in a fictional universe.

At the center stands Joppie, the cute fat pink piglet with bright blue eyes, white mohawk crest, multiple silver earrings, white pacifier, and his diaper with “JOPPIE” printed on it. He stands confidently behind a glowing futuristic podium, as if running for president.

In the cheering crowd in front of him:

– humans of all ages smiling and waving;

– anthropomorphic pig-people (pigmen and pigwomen) holding campaign badges;

– a few colorful Muppet-style puppets inspired by the classic Hanson puppets, with fuzzy textures and googly eyes.

Crowd signs and posters include:

– a dramatic giant silver fork poster with the slogan “Against Censorship!”

– funny protest signs like “No More Eating Pork!”

– bright campaign signs reading “Vote Joppie!”

An old skinny man stand in a corner, with long white hair almost dreadlocks and a bewildered look in his bright blue eyes, clad in white rags and sipping from a Starbucks coffee.

The scene is lit with cinematic golden-hour light and vibrant rally spotlights. Confetti floats in the air. Holographic banners hover above the stage showing Joppie’s smiling face.

Color palette: bold, saturated, cheerful.

Composition: wide-angle shot focused on Joppie at the podium with the excited crowd filling the foreground.

1ox8rya,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1ox8rya/romance_and_rats_fantasy_romance_short_story/,Romance and Rats | [Fantasy] [Romance] [Short Story] [Finished],"Clare stood atop a step ladder, tiptoeing to reach the upper shelf to stash a book away.

Life of a bookshop owner was a calm one, but also full of challenges-which books to order, how many to have, whom to accept and whom to deny.

Her shirt got caught on a hook of the bookshelf, tugging at her as she desperately tried to reach the top.

In the moment of this hardship, she wished her beloved, her protector, would come to her rescue.  *‘Damsel in distress,’* she thought to herself and chuckled softly, *‘how cliché.’*

As the faith would have it, her beloved heard her thoughts, or perhaps it was the universe that heard her thoughts and delivered, but not quite in the way she wished for. He came crushing through the door, stumbling in like a drunkard after a night out, a very long night.

He could barely keep his balance and hold his weight. A rough groan escaped his parched throat as he stumbled past the desk, tossed a half-burned scroll on it. Clare could smell the stench coming off of him-sulfur, smoke, and something else, something gentle--perfume.

She shot an angry glance at him right as he threw his entire weight against the step ladder upon which she stood, throwing her off balance.

Clare, almost falling off, thanked the very hook that previously troubled her, as it caught her mid-fall. She dangled there, by her shirt, like a fish on a hook.

A faint creak of fabric alerted the rogue--the presumed savior of hers or so she hoped, but he, the hero to be, clearly had a rough night.

He tried desperately to peel himself off of the step ladder against which he was leaning--to come to her rescue, but the efforts were futile.

The fabric gave way, tearing at last, sending her plummeting straight to the floor.

She waited and waited for her hero, her savior to come to her rescue, but he was far too attached to his own new hero to actually do so.

She whispered something midfall--the wind broke her fall and slowly lowered her to the ground.

She shot another glare at him.

“Really, Caden?” she hissed at him, “Barge in smelling like a freshly grilled chicken, assault me with your stench, and then let the gravity finish me off?”

He blinked at her, his cheek firmly pressed against the wood of the step ladder. He tried to swallow but there was nothing to swallow. His voice was deep and raspy, as if someone who hadn’t had a drop of water in a week, smoke still curled off of his cape. His gaze darted to the burned scroll on the table

“I got it, don’t thank me.”

His demonic voice sent a shiver through her body. As she got up and dusted off she sighed, “The only thing worth thanking you for is your miserable attempt at murder. Weren’t you supposed to be a professional at that?”

He peeled himself off the ladder at last and staggered toward her, arms wide out, a pitiful attempt at a hug that she easily dodged, sending him plummeting to the floor.

“So, what is this?” she picked up the half-burned scroll by the edge with two fingers, it stank.

“Coffee,” he uttered, crawling like a living dead toward a cup of iced-coffee sitting on the chair in front of him.

“I doubt that,” she remarked, examining the scroll while covering her mouth and nose with a sleeve to make the stench durable.

“What kind of hell-hole did you find this in?”

There was silence, that, a moment later, was broken by a loud gulp, and then another. A clank of porcelain was followed by a relieved sigh, “Gahhhh, I am alive.”

“About not to be, that was to be my first cup of the day,” Clare growled, letting go of the scroll, ignoring it as it fluttered to her desk.

Caden swallowed audibly, his gaze darted to the scroll that lay as if an abandoned puppy on the table. He smiled, “Uhm, so, about that,” he stuttered. She squinted at him, “You DRANK! MY! COFFEE!”

Caden smiled nervously and raised his finger up, “Correction, I rescued your coffee from the cruel fate of abandonment. You would’ve forgotten about it anyway.”

Clare’s gaze was cold, and he could feel the mana gathering around her, “It was my cup,” she spoke slowly, emphasizing every word. Caden sneezed-a plum of smoke shot out of his lungs like an erupting volcano, followed by a spark of magic that he couldn’t have possessed. As smoke shrouded her vision, she glanced away, waving it off as if it was a persistent fly.

As the smoke thinned and slowly dissipated, she coughed slightly-the stench irritated her but not enough to prove worthy of her using magic to remove it any faster; in fact, she appreciated the visual break from someone she was about to turn into a frog for his wrongdoings. She turned her head back toward Caden, just to realize he wasn’t there anymore.

“Ha-ha, very funny mister ‘oh I’m the coolest rogue in town I work for the grand library,’” she mocked, glancing around.

He was nowhere to be found, and then her attention was caught by a faint meow. She scanned her little bookshop for anything that was out of place, and sure enough, she spotted a white and black cat sitting on the rug where Caden had previously stood. It had a black pattern on its face that resembled a rogue’s mask.

She froze for a moment, her mind racing through the possibilities, and then she burst out into maniacal laughter, “Hahaha, a cat? Either you have learned a new trick during your most recent excursion, or I lost control over my magic.”

The cat stared at her with concern in its eyes.

“Meow?”

Caden tried, his voice-squeaky and feline.

Clare knelt beside him, reaching over to his head.

“Well, well, finally a version of you that’d actually be able to land on your feet, and probably be better at sneaking around. An upgrade, I dare say. And you are quite cute, definitely an upgrade.”

Caden tilted his head, concern growing in his eyes, as did the meows--slowly turning into incoherent cat noises as he began rolling around and examining himself. Clare could only imagine the things he was trying to say, and the more she imagined, the more it made her chuckle.

“Yyyap, definitely my Caden,” she sneered, “Short, furred and have no dignity whatsoever.”

Caden paused, glaring up at her with a hint of resentment.

“What? Awhhh don’t be so angry, you’re purr-fect as you are my darling. In fact, you’re better than ever before, think about it-you no longer need to be careful on your missions, you have whole 9 lives, and I don’t need to worry about you anymore.”

Caden sat down angrily and looked away. An annoyed half-hiss-half-meow escaped his lips.

“Dawhh, fine fine my little prince, let me quickly undo that charm.”

She stood back up and held her hands out in front of herself, gathering mana in the palms of her hands. She focused, remembered his human shape well-the stubble, the faint scar on his cheek.

She whispered a chant in a tongue Caden never quite learned, something that sounded like the singing of birds in the spring, combined with the eldritch horrors from his darkest nightmares. The cat sneezed-another plume of smoke erupted from him like a raging volcano, shrouding him once more. When it settled this time, Clare saw Caden on all fours, staring up at her.

“Adorable,” she mocked him.

Caden jumped up, straightened out, and cleared his throat before speaking, “Clare? What was that? Did you see that? I was a cat just now, a cat! With whiskers and all,” his eyes were bewildered, and his breath was ragged and disorientated.

She nodded smugly, “So it wasn’t a new trick you picked up? Amusing.”

She folded her arms and scanned him up and down, “And here I thought you finally learned to be better at grooming,” she mocked.

“So, who’d you piss off this time? An archwizard?”

Caden patted himself down, “No? God, that was awful, AWFUL! I had a tail, and it was just doing things. Ugh, never aga-chooo” she sneezed again.

Clare impatiently snapped her fingers while whispering a chant. A mighty gust of wind fluttered some books open and swiftly removed the smoke’s veil, revealing a squeaking rat where Caden stood. It had a fur pattern in the shape of a bandit’s mask on its eyes.

“Not quite the trash-panda I was hoping to see, but this’ll do.”

Though her words were those of mockery, her expression showed concern and distress.

Caden ran a circle, examined his body, and then proceeded to angrily squeak incoherent rat-noises. She watched with a bemused expression before grabbing him by the tip of his tail. Caden squeaked angrily, gesturing with his tiny paws like a lawyer presenting a bulletproof defense for his client. Clare chuckled, “What was that? Wanna make some soup? Adorable.”

The rat went silent at last, folding up its tiny paws. Clare glanced at the door through which he stumbled, “Whatever happened to you, I clearly don’t have the power to undo it. Congratulations, you’ve been cursed! How exciting,” she squealed happily before flinging him through the door, on the other side of which was a dark, dungeon-looking room.

She stepped through the door behind him, snapping her finger before closing the door, to change the bookstore’s sign to ‘closed’.

The room was dark, the air was stale, and it smelled of mildew. An ancient dungeon that hadn’t seen the day of light or proper air circulation in probably centuries. At the table just a few meters away sat a young-looking couple, each reading a book despite the darkness.

The rat landed with a soft ‘plop’ right atop the head of a pale-skinned, elegantly dressed man who sat at the table.

Caden froze.

He could smell the blood thirst, the murder intent from these creatures. ‘Vampires’ he thought to himself as his tiny claws dug into the man’s hair while he pretended to be a banana peel, or something equally as harmless.

“Lu? What’s that?” the female asked curiously while glancing over her book.

Lucien rolled his eyes up, “That? Must be the wind or something,” he replied with the elegance of an ancient duke, ignoring the presence on his head.

“Yea? And here I thought it was a new fashion accessory,” she remarked.

“Kira, my darling, you know well that my sense of fashion does not include fur; it is so unclassy.”

They each returned their attention to the books. Lucien did not so much as blink when he heard Clare’s soft steps approaching the table.

“Clare,” he spoke softly in a half-threatening, half-welcoming tone. His voice was smooth like an aged wine, riddled with mystery.

“To what do we owe the pleasure?” Kira spoke up, her voice almost opposite of his-brimming with genuine excitement and curiosity.

Clare briefly explained the situation to them. Kira, leaning on her hand on the table nodded at every word with the excitement of a puppy who finally got to see something new after days of mundaneness.

“Oh my, your darling is cursed? How exciting is that? Last time mine got cursed, he roamed the nights and assaulted innocent people, though, now that I think about it-that’s just his normal evening when he’s not with me.”

Clare glanced at her, then at Lucien, and then chuckled, “Well, good thing most of his nights are spent studying and not hunting. Now then, what do you make of it?”

Lucien rolled his eyes up, “My dear new hat, hang on tight as it might get a little shaky up there.”

Caden’s eyes shot open as he grasped with his tiny paws onto the black-as-the-shadows-in-the-night-hair of the vampire. Lucien got up, snapped his fingers, conjuring several bottles on the table and a shaker.

Then proceeded to pour various amounts of different liquids into the shaker. Clare sat down, watching him work his magic.

“Hmm, not sure if he’s making me a cocktail, or brewing Caden a potion of transmutation?”

Kira chuckled softly, “Why not both? He has been practicing, what he calls potion-tending, mixing his bartending hobbies with potion brewery, the wizards are most excited about it.”

She bobbed her head in the direction of a dark corner where a bar counter stood, with a few men laying around in the most uncomfortable poses imaginable to mankind, one was twisted like a pretzel, with his pointy hat resting on his butt, and the other-hung off a chandelier by his legs.

Clare smiled nervously, “I see, I uh, I think I’ll pass. Caden on the other hand was telling me how parched his throat was.”

Caden-a frightened rat who was hanging on for his dear life on the vampire’s head, squealed out of protest, but Clare dismissed his concerned squeals, “It’s okay dear, I’m sure-Lucien would do you no harm.”

The potiontail was done. Lucien poured it into a glass, threw in a straw, a slice of lemon, and a tiny little umbrella.

“Go on then, this should undo most enchantments of this type.”

Clare watched curiously, “My magic couldn’t, wonder if yours will.”

Lucien sneered, “Well, I am a few centuries older, I’ve picked up a thing or two about these in my time.”

Caden licked the potion, the strong minty-citrus taste tickled his nostrils just the right way to make him sneeze. The same plume of smoke, and then a crash as he fell off the table.

“Gah! Hah! I’m human, I’m me! Yes!”

The three watched a bewildered rogue excitedly jump up to his feet and pat himself down, “Gods, I really really really don’t like having tails.”

Clare scuffed, “Awh, and here I thought the rat was quite the suitable shape for you-sly and cheeky.”

Caden sighed, “Aren’t I damn handsome as I am?”

Clare shrugged, “Nawhh, you were the cutest pocket-sized rogue around for a while, and what’s best? You couldn’t finish my cup of coffee in that shape, you thief.”

Caden opened his mouth to protest, but as fate would have it-his nose itched.

“I-I-achoo.”

Clare laughed out loud, “Oh, what is it this time? Be a snake!”

Lucien squinted at the cloud of black smoke that erupted from the rogue, enshrouding his transformation.

“Interesting,” he remarked.

Kira leaned against Clare, her hand on Clare’s shoulder, her soft voice whispering, “I think a bunny would be cute to have.”

Clare chuckled, “Oh my god yes.”

And a bunny he was. A black furred bunny who twitched his nose, sniffing the air, and then stomped angrily on the floor.

“Dawhhh, he’s adorable. Can we keep him if you don’t want him?” Kira whispered cheekily.

“No, he’s mine, even if he is a thieving asshole,” Clare shot back.

“Dawhh,” Kira mocked, sitting back down.

“And now?” Lucien queried.

“Well, we could cook him,” Kira suggested.

“Or we look through your archives. You two are in charge of the curses and hexes section for a reason.”

“Is it because we’re immortal?” Lucien sighed.

“Probably,” Clare admitted, already walking down the dark aisle of books. The bunny continued to angrily stomp around, but his presence was largely ignored.

Hours passed as they studied and researched the hex. Well, the three of them did anyhow, the rabbit--he just nibbled on the corners of the ancient tomes as though they were fresh hay. The hex was an unusual one, it had a purpose, and as they had now realized, the power of it came from emotions, not magic. Generally, such hexes were placed out of jealousy, but this one seemed different.

“Back we go,” Clare called out after hours of studying.

“No need to trouble you two any further,” she excused herself, reaching up to pick up her hus-bun to be from below Kira’s gentle touch, as she spent those hours stroking the bunny’s soft fur.

“Dawh, he was so soft, stay a while longer,” Kira protested but Clare wasn’t having it.

“No reason to, you both are busy, and the drunk-zards are awaking,” she shot a glance at the drunk wizards who were starting to awaken.

“Do come back soon,” Lucien sneered.

“Not if I can help it,” Clare shot back as she walked through a door that led back to her bookstore.

As soon as they returned, Clare caught a glimpse of someone who was seemingly staring through the window, but upon noticing them-tried to sneak away. She stormed to the store’s front, threw the door open and yelled out, “HEY THERE! Wanna come in?”

A humbled, frightened shriek was the response to her sudden shout. A cloaked figured shook its head, “Uh, n-no it’s quite alright.”

Clare stepped out, placed her hand on the figure’s shoulder and squeezed gently, “Dawh, don’t be shy now. I saw you lurking around. Were you waiting for our return?”

The figure turned around slowly. Beneath the cloak and hood was a young woman, perhaps in her early twenties, or late teens. She looked at the bunny, which Clare was holding in her arms.

“Awh, cute,” she whispered.

Clare glanced down at Caden, who seemed quite comfy-being cradled in his darling’s arms. He stretched and yawned, cozying up.

“Uh, my new erhm, pet. He’s an absolute asshole, even if he looks cute. Can I help you?”

The girl looked up at Clare hesitantly, mumbling just barely audibly under her breath, “I don’t think he is.”

“Huh?” Clare queried.

“N-nothing,” the girl stammered.

“I, I’ll come back another day,” she hesitated, turning and hurrying away.

Clare tried to reach out to her again, but her hand phased through the girl’s shoulder this time, she disappeared a moment later, leaving behind nought but the faintest trace of magic. Clare could feel the magic tingle her skin.

“Huh,” she pondered, turning to leave. As she returned her hand to Caden to stroke his soft fur, she felt a similar trace of magic on his fur.

Upon returning back to the store, Clare sat the bunny down and tapped her finger impatiently against her other arm.

“You know her?” she queried. Caden shook his head.

“Hmm, she seemed to know you at least.”

Caden jumped and twisted his body in the best attempt to shrug, or express himself shrugging.

“Uhuh,” Clare got on all fours and leaned down, sniffing him.

“When you stumbled out of whatever hell-hole you were in, you carried on you a stench of sulfur, smoke, ash, and perfume,” she continued.

Caden nervously backed away, “Don’t worry. You might be an idiot, but you wouldn’t cheat, I know that much.”

He nodded.

“But why the perfume?” he shrugged again.

“Her magic,” Clare’s fingers dug through Caden’s fur, feeling for the traces of magic.

“Yeah, it’s hers.”

Caden glared at the window, there was nobody there.

“Amusing. Let’s go find her.”

Caden’s body shook with fright as he pictured the most gruesome outcome imagine while Clare carried him through the city’s streets. Clare was lovely. She was sweet, caring, stubborn, cheeky, quick to insult him, but she was also protective of what was hers. Caden saw her turn a werewolf into a little chihuahua once, when he got growled at while she was annoyed.

There was a gentle knock, followed by an impatient one, and then loud banging, as Clare hammered on the door as if it owed her lunch money. He almost felt bad for the door; fortunately, it was an ordinary door, and not a living, sentient creature, or perhaps-this particular door liked it rough.

The door creaked with the labor of antiqued hinges that hadn’t had the pleasure of being lubricated in decades. On the other side stood the young woman from before. She glanced instantly at the bunny, then at Clare’s furious face.

“Uhm, hi?” she hesitated. Clare stepped through the door despite not being invited, fury burning in her gaze.

“Why?” she asked without giving the girl even the faintest chance to defend herself.

The girl stepped back, frightened. Her back pressed against the wall, as if hoping to fall through it so she wouldn’t have to see Clare’s furious gaze anymore.

“Why?”

Clare repeated herself; her voice was sharper and snappier this time.

“B-b-because I him, I he-he he SAVED ME!” she stuttered, and then shot out her reason as if held at a gun point. It was almost anticlimactic, almost, but effective. The fury in Clare’s eyes faded, replaced by a startled confusion as she recoiled ever so slightly from the sudden shout.

“He saved you? From what, a library fine for a delayed book-return?”

The girl sniffled, tears running down her cheeks as she began to spew out the story, “That too but no well, so, I was out on a field-trip with the class, to the Grand Library, and it was overwhelming, truly. It’s so big, clouds, flying tomes, wizards in walls, talking benches, so much was happening and there he was-cool, calm, collected, professional.”

“Clumsy idiot who had caused more troubles than he solved,” Clare mocked her.

“W-well so, we were in the dimensional section, one of the dictionaries toppled and fell off the shelf when someone bumped into it, I-I did… The book fluttered open as it was falling, baring its fangs at the excitement of consuming a young, innocent mage apprentice. He happened to be there.”

She paused and then continued.

“A single gentle shove to push me out of the way. He caught the book, whispered something roguishly to it, tamed its fury in an instant, and replaced it on the shelf, just to vanish without a trace a moment later. To him-it was nothing, an ordinary day. But to m-me, it was, everything-” her voice trailed off.

Clare blinked in disbelief, “You, have got to be kidding me.”

The girl sobbed softly, “I, I thought if I could, I wanted him to notice me. It was supposed to be a love-spell, not a morph hex, b-but while brewing my hands were shaking and-and-” she stammered.

“You messed up the ingredients,” Clare sighed.

Clare glanced down at Caden, “See what happens when you save damsels, you idiot? She tried to cast ‘love me forever’ and landed on a ‘turn into a petting zoo every time you sneeze.’ Excellent work, both of you.”

Clare set the bunny down and crossed her arms, tapping her foot impatiently. The girl sobbed again.

“Okay, first of all-relax, you didn’t kill him at least, thanks for that. Secondly-show me the original potion, I’ll have the alchemists reverse-engineer it.”

The girl wiped the tears and snot with the sleeve of her robes, “Y-yes of course.”

She turned to guide the way. Clare followed. As they walked down the dark staircase to her basement, Clare whispered, “And if you curse him ever again, I’ll turn you into a hamster and set you into a wheel to run endlessly in the window of my shop.”

“U-understood,” the girl gulped.

Somewhere amidst the darkness of the hexes and curses archives, a voice whispered softly, while enjoying a little entertainment in the crystal ball, “Shame, he made a very cute bunny.”

A menacing chuckle echoed through the darkness, “Then perhaps, next time you’ll be more convincing to leave him with us?”

Caden returned to his normal self, and to this day-continues to apologize to Clare every time he so much as glances at her coffee.

Life of a bookshop owner was a calm one, but also full of challenges-which books to order, how many to have, whom to accept and whom to deny.

Her shirt got caught on a hook of the bookshelf, tugging at her as she desperately tried to reach the top.

In the moment of this hardship, she wished her beloved, her protector, would come to her rescue.  *‘Damsel in distress,’* she thought to herself and chuckled softly, *‘how cliché.’*

As the faith would have it, her beloved heard her thoughts, or perhaps it was the universe that heard her thoughts and delivered, but not quite in the way she wished for. He came crushing through the door, stumbling in like a drunkard after a night out, a very long night.

He could barely keep his balance and hold his weight. A rough groan escaped his parched throat as he stumbled past the desk, tossed a half-burned scroll on it. Clare could smell the stench coming off of him-sulfur, smoke, and something else, something gentle--perfume.

She shot an angry glance at him right as he threw his entire weight against the step ladder upon which she stood, throwing her off balance.

Clare, almost falling off, thanked the very hook that previously troubled her, as it caught her mid-fall. She dangled there, by her shirt, like a fish on a hook.

A faint creak of fabric alerted the rogue--the presumed savior of hers or so she hoped, but he, the hero to be, clearly had a rough night.

He tried desperately to peel himself off of the step ladder against which he was leaning--to come to her rescue, but the efforts were futile.

The fabric gave way, tearing at last, sending her plummeting straight to the floor.

She waited and waited for her hero, her savior to come to her rescue, but he was far too attached to his own new hero to actually do so.

She whispered something midfall--the wind broke her fall and slowly lowered her to the ground.

She shot another glare at him.

“Really, Caden?” she hissed at him, “Barge in smelling like a freshly grilled chicken, assault me with your stench, and then let the gravity finish me off?”

He blinked at her, his cheek firmly pressed against the wood of the step ladder. He tried to swallow but there was nothing to swallow. His voice was deep and raspy, as if someone who hadn’t had a drop of water in a week, smoke still curled off of his cape. His gaze darted to the burned scroll on the table

“I got it, don’t thank me.”

His demonic voice sent a shiver through her body. As she got up and dusted off she sighed, “The only thing worth thanking you for is your miserable attempt at murder. Weren’t you supposed to be a professional at that?”

He peeled himself off the ladder at last and staggered toward her, arms wide out, a pitiful attempt at a hug that she easily dodged, sending him plummeting to the floor.

“So, what is this?” she picked up the half-burned scroll by the edge with two fingers, it stank.

“Coffee,” he uttered, crawling like a living dead toward a cup of iced-coffee sitting on the chair in front of him.

“I doubt that,” she remarked, examining the scroll while covering her mouth and nose with a sleeve to make the stench durable.

“What kind of hell-hole did you find this in?”

There was silence, that, a moment later, was broken by a loud gulp, and then another. A clank of porcelain was followed by a relieved sigh, “Gahhhh, I am alive.”

“About not to be, that was to be my first cup of the day,” Clare growled, letting go of the scroll, ignoring it as it fluttered to her desk.

Caden swallowed audibly, his gaze darted to the scroll that lay as if an abandoned puppy on the table. He smiled, “Uhm, so, about that,” he stuttered. She squinted at him, “You DRANK! MY! COFFEE!”

Caden smiled nervously and raised his finger up, “Correction, I rescued your coffee from the cruel fate of abandonment. You would’ve forgotten about it anyway.”

Clare’s gaze was cold, and he could feel the mana gathering around her, “It was my cup,” she spoke slowly, emphasizing every word. Caden sneezed-a plum of smoke shot out of his lungs like an erupting volcano, followed by a spark of magic that he couldn’t have possessed. As smoke shrouded her vision, she glanced away, waving it off as if it was a persistent fly.

Caden’s eyes shot open as he grasped with his tiny paws onto the black-as-the-shadows-in-the-night-hair of the vampire. Lucien got up, snapped his fingers, conjuring several bottles on the table and a shaker.

Then proceeded to pour various amounts of different liquids into the shaker. Clare sat down, watching him work his magic.

“Hmm, not sure if he’s making me a cocktail, or brewing Caden a potion of transmutation?”

Kira chuckled softly, “Why not both? He has been practicing, what he calls potion-tending, mixing his bartending hobbies with potion brewery, the wizards are most excited about it.”

She bobbed her head in the direction of a dark corner where a bar counter stood, with a few men laying around in the most uncomfortable poses imaginable to mankind, one was twisted like a pretzel, with his pointy hat resting on his butt, and the other-hung off a chandelier by his legs.

Clare smiled nervously, “I see, I uh, I think I’ll pass. Caden on the other hand was telling me how parched his throat was.”

“Gah! Hah! I’m human, I’m me! Yes!”

The three watched a bewildered rogue excitedly jump up to his feet and pat himself down, “Gods, I really really really don’t like having tails.”

Clare scuffed, “Awh, and here I thought the rat was quite the suitable shape for you-sly and cheeky.”

Caden sighed, “Aren’t I damn handsome as I am?”

Clare shrugged, “Nawhh, you were the cutest pocket-sized rogue around for a while, and what’s best? You couldn’t finish my cup of coffee in that shape, you thief.”

“Well, we could cook him,” Kira suggested.

“Or we look through your archives. You two are in charge of the curses and hexes section for a reason.”

“Is it because we’re immortal?” Lucien sighed.

“Probably,” Clare admitted, already walking down the dark aisle of books. The bunny continued to angrily stomp around, but his presence was largely ignored.

Hours passed as they studied and researched the hex. Well, the three of them did anyhow, the rabbit--he just nibbled on the corners of the ancient tomes as though they were fresh hay. The hex was an unusual one, it had a purpose, and as they had now realized, the power of it came from emotions, not magic. Generally, such hexes were placed out of jealousy, but this one seemed different.

“Back we go,” Clare called out after hours of studying.

“No need to trouble you two any further,” she excused herself, reaching up to pick up her hus-bun to be from below Kira’s gentle touch, as she spent those hours stroking the bunny’s soft fur.

“Dawh, he was so soft, stay a while longer,” Kira protested but Clare wasn’t having it.

“No reason to, you both are busy, and the drunk-zards are awaking,” she shot a glance at the drunk wizards who were starting to awaken.

“Do come back soon,” Lucien sneered.

“Not if I can help it,” Clare shot back as she walked through a door that led back to her bookstore.

As soon as they returned, Clare caught a glimpse of someone who was seemingly staring through the window, but upon noticing them-tried to sneak away. She stormed to the store’s front, threw the door open and yelled out, “HEY THERE! Wanna come in?”

A humbled, frightened shriek was the response to her sudden shout. A cloaked figured shook its head, “Uh, n-no it’s quite alright.”

Clare stepped out, placed her hand on the figure’s shoulder and squeezed gently, “Dawh, don’t be shy now. I saw you lurking around. Were you waiting for our return?”

The figure turned around slowly. Beneath the cloak and hood was a young woman, perhaps in her early twenties, or late teens. She looked at the bunny, which Clare was holding in her arms.

“Awh, cute,” she whispered.

Clare glanced down at Caden, who seemed quite comfy-being cradled in his darling’s arms. He stretched and yawned, cozying up.

“Uh, my new erhm, pet. He’s an absolute asshole, even if he looks cute. Can I help you?”

The girl looked up at Clare hesitantly, mumbling just barely audibly under her breath, “I don’t think he is.”

“Huh?” Clare queried.

“N-nothing,” the girl stammered.

“I, I’ll come back another day,” she hesitated, turning and hurrying away.

Clare tried to reach out to her again, but her hand phased through the girl’s shoulder this time, she disappeared a moment later, leaving behind nought but the faintest trace of magic. Clare could feel the magic tingle her skin.

“Huh,” she pondered, turning to leave. As she returned her hand to Caden to stroke his soft fur, she felt a similar trace of magic on his fur.

Upon returning back to the store, Clare sat the bunny down and tapped her finger impatiently against her other arm.

“You know her?” she queried. Caden shook his head.

“Hmm, she seemed to know you at least.”

Caden jumped and twisted his body in the best attempt to shrug, or express himself shrugging.

“Uhuh,” Clare got on all fours and leaned down, sniffing him.

“When you stumbled out of whatever hell-hole you were in, you carried on you a stench of sulfur, smoke, ash, and perfume,” she continued.

Caden nervously backed away, “Don’t worry. You might be an idiot, but you wouldn’t cheat, I know that much.”

He nodded.

“But why the perfume?” he shrugged again.

“Her magic,” Clare’s fingers dug through Caden’s fur, feeling for the traces of magic.

“Yeah, it’s hers.”

Caden glared at the window, there was nobody there.

“Amusing. Let’s go find her.”

Caden’s body shook with fright as he pictured the most gruesome outcome imagine while Clare carried him through the city’s streets. Clare was lovely. She was sweet, caring, stubborn, cheeky, quick to insult him, but she was also protective of what was hers. Caden saw her turn a werewolf into a little chihuahua once, when he got growled at while she was annoyed.

There was a gentle knock, followed by an impatient one, and then loud banging, as Clare hammered on the door as if it owed her lunch money. He almost felt bad for the door; fortunately, it was an ordinary door, and not a living, sentient creature, or perhaps-this particular door liked it rough.

The door creaked with the labor of antiqued hinges that hadn’t had the pleasure of being lubricated in decades. On the other side stood the young woman from before. She glanced instantly at the bunny, then at Clare’s furious face.

“Uhm, hi?” she hesitated. Clare stepped through the door despite not being invited, fury burning in her gaze.

“Why?” she asked without giving the girl even the faintest chance to defend herself.

The girl stepped back, frightened. Her back pressed against the wall, as if hoping to fall through it so she wouldn’t have to see Clare’s furious gaze anymore.

“Why?”

Clare repeated herself; her voice was sharper and snappier this time.

“B-b-because I him, I he-he he SAVED ME!” she stuttered, and then shot out her reason as if held at a gun point. It was almost anticlimactic, almost, but effective. The fury in Clare’s eyes faded, replaced by a startled confusion as she recoiled ever so slightly from the sudden shout.

“He saved you? From what, a library fine for a delayed book-return?”

The girl sniffled, tears running down her cheeks as she began to spew out the story, “That too but no well, so, I was out on a field-trip with the class, to the Grand Library, and it was overwhelming, truly. It’s so big, clouds, flying tomes, wizards in walls, talking benches, so much was happening and there he was-cool, calm, collected, professional.”

“Clumsy idiot who had caused more troubles than he solved,” Clare mocked her.

“W-well so, we were in the dimensional section, one of the dictionaries toppled and fell off the shelf when someone bumped into it, I-I did… The book fluttered open as it was falling, baring its fangs at the excitement of consuming a young, innocent mage apprentice. He happened to be there.”

She paused and then continued.

“A single gentle shove to push me out of the way. He caught the book, whispered something roguishly to it, tamed its fury in an instant, and replaced it on the shelf, just to vanish without a trace a moment later. To him-it was nothing, an ordinary day. But to m-me, it was, everything-” her voice trailed off.

Clare blinked in disbelief, “You, have got to be kidding me.”

The girl sobbed softly, “I, I thought if I could, I wanted him to notice me. It was supposed to be a love-spell, not a morph hex, b-but while brewing my hands were shaking and-and-” she stammered.

“You messed up the ingredients,” Clare sighed.

Clare glanced down at Caden, “See what happens when you save damsels, you idiot? She tried to cast ‘love me forever’ and landed on a ‘turn into a petting zoo every time you sneeze.’ Excellent work, both of you.”

Clare set the bunny down and crossed her arms, tapping her foot impatiently. The girl sobbed again.

“Okay, first of all-relax, you didn’t kill him at least, thanks for that. Secondly-show me the original potion, I’ll have the alchemists reverse-engineer it.”

The girl wiped the tears and snot with the sleeve of her robes, “Y-yes of course.”

She turned to guide the way. Clare followed. As they walked down the dark staircase to her basement, Clare whispered, “And if you curse him ever again, I’ll turn you into a hamster and set you into a wheel to run endlessly in the window of my shop.”

“U-understood,” the girl gulped.

Somewhere amidst the darkness of the hexes and curses archives, a voice whispered softly, while enjoying a little entertainment in the crystal ball, “Shame, he made a very cute bunny.”

A menacing chuckle echoed through the darkness, “Then perhaps, next time you’ll be more convincing to leave him with us?”

Caden returned to his normal self, and to this day-continues to apologize to Clare every time he so much as glances at her coffee.

1ox8qdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ox8qdm/romance_and_rats_fantasy_romance_short_story/,Romance and Rats [Fantasy] [Romance] [Short Story] [Finished],"Clare stood atop a step ladder, tiptoeing to reach the upper shelf to stash a book away.

Life of a bookshop owner was a calm one, but also full of challenges-which books to order, how many to have, whom to accept and whom to deny.

Her shirt got caught on a hook of the bookshelf, tugging at her as she desperately tried to reach the top.

In the moment of this hardship, she wished her beloved, her protector, would come to her rescue.  *‘Damsel in distress,’* she thought to herself and chuckled softly, *‘how cliché.’*

As the faith would have it, her beloved heard her thoughts, or perhaps it was the universe that heard her thoughts and delivered, but not quite in the way she wished for. He came crushing through the door, stumbling in like a drunkard after a night out, a very long night.

He could barely keep his balance and hold his weight. A rough groan escaped his parched throat as he stumbled past the desk, tossed a half-burned scroll on it. Clare could smell the stench coming off of him-sulfur, smoke, and something else, something gentle--perfume.

She shot an angry glance at him right as he threw his entire weight against the step ladder upon which she stood, throwing her off balance.

Clare, almost falling off, thanked the very hook that previously troubled her, as it caught her mid-fall. She dangled there, by her shirt, like a fish on a hook.

A faint creak of fabric alerted the rogue--the presumed savior of hers or so she hoped, but he, the hero to be, clearly had a rough night.

He tried desperately to peel himself off of the step ladder against which he was leaning--to come to her rescue, but the efforts were futile.

The fabric gave way, tearing at last, sending her plummeting straight to the floor.

She waited and waited for her hero, her savior to come to her rescue, but he was far too attached to his own new hero to actually do so.

She whispered something midfall--the wind broke her fall and slowly lowered her to the ground.

She shot another glare at him.

“Really, Caden?” she hissed at him, “Barge in smelling like a freshly grilled chicken, assault me with your stench, and then let the gravity finish me off?”

He blinked at her, his cheek firmly pressed against the wood of the step ladder. He tried to swallow but there was nothing to swallow. His voice was deep and raspy, as if someone who hadn’t had a drop of water in a week, smoke still curled off of his cape. His gaze darted to the burned scroll on the table

“I got it, don’t thank me.”

His demonic voice sent a shiver through her body. As she got up and dusted off she sighed, “The only thing worth thanking you for is your miserable attempt at murder. Weren’t you supposed to be a professional at that?”

He peeled himself off the ladder at last and staggered toward her, arms wide out, a pitiful attempt at a hug that she easily dodged, sending him plummeting to the floor.

“So, what is this?” she picked up the half-burned scroll by the edge with two fingers, it stank.

“Coffee,” he uttered, crawling like a living dead toward a cup of iced-coffee sitting on the chair in front of him.

“I doubt that,” she remarked, examining the scroll while covering her mouth and nose with a sleeve to make the stench durable.

“What kind of hell-hole did you find this in?”

There was silence, that, a moment later, was broken by a loud gulp, and then another. A clank of porcelain was followed by a relieved sigh, “Gahhhh, I am alive.”

“About not to be, that was to be my first cup of the day,” Clare growled, letting go of the scroll, ignoring it as it fluttered to her desk.

Caden swallowed audibly, his gaze darted to the scroll that lay as if an abandoned puppy on the table. He smiled, “Uhm, so, about that,” he stuttered. She squinted at him, “You DRANK! MY! COFFEE!”

Caden smiled nervously and raised his finger up, “Correction, I rescued your coffee from the cruel fate of abandonment. You would’ve forgotten about it anyway.”

Clare’s gaze was cold, and he could feel the mana gathering around her, “It was my cup,” she spoke slowly, emphasizing every word. Caden sneezed-a plum of smoke shot out of his lungs like an erupting volcano, followed by a spark of magic that he couldn’t have possessed. As smoke shrouded her vision, she glanced away, waving it off as if it was a persistent fly.



\#



As the smoke thinned and slowly dissipated, she coughed slightly-the stench irritated her but not enough to prove worthy of her using magic to remove it any faster; in fact, she appreciated the visual break from someone she was about to turn into a frog for his wrongdoings. She turned her head back toward Caden, just to realize he wasn’t there anymore.

“Ha-ha, very funny mister ‘oh I’m the coolest rogue in town I work for the grand library,’” she mocked, glancing around.

He was nowhere to be found, and then her attention was caught by a faint meow. She scanned her little bookshop for anything that was out of place, and sure enough, she spotted a white and black cat sitting on the rug where Caden had previously stood. It had a black pattern on its face that resembled a rogue’s mask.

She froze for a moment, her mind racing through the possibilities, and then she burst out into maniacal laughter, “Hahaha, a cat? Either you have learned a new trick during your most recent excursion, or I lost control over my magic.”

The cat stared at her with concern in its eyes.

“Meow?”

Caden tried, his voice-squeaky and feline.

Clare knelt beside him, reaching over to his head.

“Well, well, finally a version of you that’d actually be able to land on your feet, and probably be better at sneaking around. An upgrade, I dare say. And you are quite cute, definitely an upgrade.”

Caden tilted his head, concern growing in his eyes, as did the meows--slowly turning into incoherent cat noises as he began rolling around and examining himself. Clare could only imagine the things he was trying to say, and the more she imagined, the more it made her chuckle.

“Yyyap, definitely my Caden,” she sneered, “Short, furred and have no dignity whatsoever.”

Caden paused, glaring up at her with a hint of resentment.

“What? Awhhh don’t be so angry, you’re purr-fect as you are my darling. In fact, you’re better than ever before, think about it-you no longer need to be careful on your missions, you have whole 9 lives, and I don’t need to worry about you anymore.”

Caden sat down angrily and looked away. An annoyed half-hiss-half-meow escaped his lips.

“Dawhh, fine fine my little prince, let me quickly undo that charm.”

She stood back up and held her hands out in front of herself, gathering mana in the palms of her hands. She focused, remembered his human shape well-the stubble, the faint scar on his cheek.

She whispered a chant in a tongue Caden never quite learned, something that sounded like the singing of birds in the spring, combined with the eldritch horrors from his darkest nightmares. The cat sneezed-another plume of smoke erupted from him like a raging volcano, shrouding him once more. When it settled this time, Clare saw Caden on all fours, staring up at her.

“Adorable,” she mocked him.

Caden jumped up, straightened out, and cleared his throat before speaking, “Clare? What was that? Did you see that? I was a cat just now, a cat! With whiskers and all,” his eyes were bewildered, and his breath was ragged and disorientated.

She nodded smugly, “So it wasn’t a new trick you picked up? Amusing.”

She folded her arms and scanned him up and down, “And here I thought you finally learned to be better at grooming,” she mocked.

“So, who’d you piss off this time? An archwizard?”

Caden patted himself down, “No? God, that was awful, AWFUL! I had a tail, and it was just doing things. Ugh, never aga-chooo” she sneezed again.

Clare impatiently snapped her fingers while whispering a chant. A mighty gust of wind fluttered some books open and swiftly removed the smoke’s veil, revealing a squeaking rat where Caden stood. It had a fur pattern in the shape of a bandit’s mask on its eyes.

“Not quite the trash-panda I was hoping to see, but this’ll do.”

Though her words were those of mockery, her expression showed concern and distress.

Caden ran a circle, examined his body, and then proceeded to angrily squeak incoherent rat-noises. She watched with a bemused expression before grabbing him by the tip of his tail. Caden squeaked angrily, gesturing with his tiny paws like a lawyer presenting a bulletproof defense for his client. Clare chuckled, “What was that? Wanna make some soup? Adorable.”

The rat went silent at last, folding up its tiny paws. Clare glanced at the door through which he stumbled, “Whatever happened to you, I clearly don’t have the power to undo it. Congratulations, you’ve been cursed! How exciting,” she squealed happily before flinging him through the door, on the other side of which was a dark, dungeon-looking room.

She stepped through the door behind him, snapping her finger before closing the door, to change the bookstore’s sign to ‘closed’.

The room was dark, the air was stale, and it smelled of mildew. An ancient dungeon that hadn’t seen the day of light or proper air circulation in probably centuries. At the table just a few meters away sat a young-looking couple, each reading a book despite the darkness.

The rat landed with a soft ‘plop’ right atop the head of a pale-skinned, elegantly dressed man who sat at the table.

Caden froze.

He could smell the blood thirst, the murder intent from these creatures. ‘Vampires’ he thought to himself as his tiny claws dug into the man’s hair while he pretended to be a banana peel, or something equally as harmless.

“Lu? What’s that?” the female asked curiously while glancing over her book.

Lucien rolled his eyes up, “That? Must be the wind or something,” he replied with the elegance of an ancient duke, ignoring the presence on his head.

“Yea? And here I thought it was a new fashion accessory,” she remarked.

“Kira, my darling, you know well that my sense of fashion does not include fur; it is so unclassy.”

They each returned their attention to the books. Lucien did not so much as blink when he heard Clare’s soft steps approaching the table.

“Clare,” he spoke softly in a half-threatening, half-welcoming tone. His voice was smooth like an aged wine, riddled with mystery.

“To what do we owe the pleasure?” Kira spoke up, her voice almost opposite of his-brimming with genuine excitement and curiosity.

Clare briefly explained the situation to them. Kira, leaning on her hand on the table nodded at every word with the excitement of a puppy who finally got to see something new after days of mundaneness.

“Oh my, your darling is cursed? How exciting is that? Last time mine got cursed, he roamed the nights and assaulted innocent people, though, now that I think about it-that’s just his normal evening when he’s not with me.”

Clare glanced at her, then at Lucien, and then chuckled, “Well, good thing most of his nights are spent studying and not hunting. Now then, what do you make of it?”

Lucien rolled his eyes up, “My dear new hat, hang on tight as it might get a little shaky up there.”

Caden’s eyes shot open as he grasped with his tiny paws onto the black-as-the-shadows-in-the-night-hair of the vampire. Lucien got up, snapped his fingers, conjuring several bottles on the table and a shaker.

Then proceeded to pour various amounts of different liquids into the shaker. Clare sat down, watching him work his magic.

“Hmm, not sure if he’s making me a cocktail, or brewing Caden a potion of transmutation?”

Kira chuckled softly, “Why not both? He has been practicing, what he calls potion-tending, mixing his bartending hobbies with potion brewery, the wizards are most excited about it.”

She bobbed her head in the direction of a dark corner where a bar counter stood, with a few men laying around in the most uncomfortable poses imaginable to mankind, one was twisted like a pretzel, with his pointy hat resting on his butt, and the other-hung off a chandelier by his legs.

Clare smiled nervously, “I see, I uh, I think I’ll pass. Caden on the other hand was telling me how parched his throat was.”

Caden-a frightened rat who was hanging on for his dear life on the vampire’s head, squealed out of protest, but Clare dismissed his concerned squeals, “It’s okay dear, I’m sure-Lucien would do you no harm.”

The potiontail was done. Lucien poured it into a glass, threw in a straw, a slice of lemon, and a tiny little umbrella.

“Go on then, this should undo most enchantments of this type.”

Clare watched curiously, “My magic couldn’t, wonder if yours will.”

Lucien sneered, “Well, I am a few centuries older, I’ve picked up a thing or two about these in my time.”

Caden licked the potion, the strong minty-citrus taste tickled his nostrils just the right way to make him sneeze. The same plume of smoke, and then a crash as he fell off the table.

“Gah! Hah! I’m human, I’m me! Yes!”

The three watched a bewildered rogue excitedly jump up to his feet and pat himself down, “Gods, I really really really don’t like having tails.”

Clare scuffed, “Awh, and here I thought the rat was quite the suitable shape for you-sly and cheeky.”

Caden sighed, “Aren’t I damn handsome as I am?”

Clare shrugged, “Nawhh, you were the cutest pocket-sized rogue around for a while, and what’s best? You couldn’t finish my cup of coffee in that shape, you thief.”

Caden opened his mouth to protest, but as fate would have it-his nose itched.

“I-I-achoo.”

Clare laughed out loud, “Oh, what is it this time? Be a snake!”

Lucien squinted at the cloud of black smoke that erupted from the rogue, enshrouding his transformation.

“Interesting,” he remarked.

Kira leaned against Clare, her hand on Clare’s shoulder, her soft voice whispering, “I think a bunny would be cute to have.”

Clare chuckled, “Oh my god yes.”

And a bunny he was. A black furred bunny who twitched his nose, sniffing the air, and then stomped angrily on the floor.

“Dawhhh, he’s adorable. Can we keep him if you don’t want him?” Kira whispered cheekily.

“No, he’s mine, even if he is a thieving asshole,” Clare shot back.

“Dawhh,” Kira mocked, sitting back down.

“And now?” Lucien queried.

“Well, we could cook him,” Kira suggested.

“Or we look through your archives. You two are in charge of the curses and hexes section for a reason.”

“Is it because we’re immortal?” Lucien sighed.

“Probably,” Clare admitted, already walking down the dark aisle of books. The bunny continued to angrily stomp around, but his presence was largely ignored.

“No need to trouble you two any further,” she excused herself, reaching up to pick up her hus-bun to be from below Kira’s gentle touch, as she spent those hours stroking the bunny’s soft fur.

“Dawh, he was so soft, stay a while longer,” Kira protested but Clare wasn’t having it.

“No reason to, you both are busy, and the drunk-zards are awaking,” she shot a glance at the drunk wizards who were starting to awaken.

“Do come back soon,” Lucien sneered.

“Not if I can help it,” Clare shot back as she walked through a door that led back to her bookstore.

1ox8q8v,https://i.redd.it/k1z1w2dyda1g1.jpeg,Journaling Regularly with a Hocoro Dip Pen,"I started using my Hocoro dip nib more regularly for journaling to use up more problematic inks (Diamine Forever Tiger Lily pictured here).

My pouch here is all I need for self-contained portable dip pen writing: a small glass container filled with water for rinsing, a rag for wiping/cleaning, a few ""dinky dip inkwells"" filled with a few inks, a couple cotton swaps in case I need to scrub pigment particles out.

All packed, it's not that much more space than say, a large pen case.

Pros:

\+ You can carry a variety of colors and switch quickly without having to carry around a bunch of pens.

\+ Laughs at pigment and staining inks. Everything is exposed for scrubbing and cleaning.

\+ If you misplace the pouch, at least the materials are relatively inexpensive to replace.

  
Cons:

\- You need some table space for your setup, no writing in tight spaces or on the move.

1ox8pm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/newproductsamazon/comments/1ox8pm7/when_is_the_best_time_to_purchase_a_puzzle_board/,When is the best time to purchase a puzzle board?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting asked this question a lot lately - when's actually the best time to buy a puzzle board? I figured I'd share what I've learned after doing way too much research on this.

**The Short Answer: Right Now (Seriously)**

Look, I'm gonna be honest with you. The best time to grab a puzzle board is whenever you need one, but if you're trying to save money, there are definitely some sweet spots throughout the year.

**Black Friday and Cyber Monday are obvious winners.** I've seen puzzle boards drop like 30-40% during these sales. But here's the thing - the good ones sell out FAST. Like, we're talking within hours sometimes.

**After the holidays** (think January through February) is another solid window. Stores are clearing out inventory and making room for new stuff. Plus, everyone just got puzzles as gifts and realizes they need somewhere to actually work on them.

**Amazon Prime Day** in July is sneaky good too. A lot of people don't think about puzzle accessories during summer, but that's exactly why the deals pop up then.

**Here's What I Actually Did:**

I stopped waiting for the ""perfect"" sale and just got mine when I was ready to start puzzling seriously. I found a great selection at [this puzzle board collection](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board) and honestly, having it sooner meant I actually used it more. The longer I waited, the more my half-finished puzzles took over my dining table.

**Things to Consider Besides Timing:**

The price difference between waiting 3 months for a sale versus buying now might only be like 15 bucks. Meanwhile, you're either not doing puzzles or you're destroying your back hunched over a coffee table. Not worth it, in my opinion.

Also, puzzle board availability can be weird. The specific size or style you want might not be in stock during sale periods. I've seen people wait for Black Friday only to find out their preferred jigsaw puzzle board sold out in October.

**My Recommendation:**

If there's a major sale coming up in the next 2-3 weeks, sure, wait it out. But if you're reading this in like March or August? Just grab one. Your neck and your dining table will thank you.

Check out [the options here](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board) and see what fits your puzzle size and space. Most are pretty affordable year-round anyway, especially when you think about how much use you'll actually get out of them.

The way I see it, the best time to buy a puzzle board is when you'll actually use it. A good deal doesn't matter if your puzzle pieces are still scattered across three rooms because you kept waiting.

Happy puzzling!",1,1763154742.0,newproductsamazon,0,1.0,False

I’ve now storyboarded **70 full frames** from the surviving footage and photos — including the infamous **ape-on-fire beach sequence**, the dodgy-guy masturbation and f-rape sequence moment, ape attacks, and a bunch of cursed production stills I didn’t think still existed.

The layout is starting to fall into place:

Obviously times are hard, costs are high, but I've been pretty surprised recently how many people I talk to are really trying to tip the LEAST amount they feel like they can get away with socially. I'm not talking about feeling ambushed into tipping on a coffee order, I'm talking about people who are going out and paying $150/person and then busting out a calculator to not give one dime over 20%.

I usually just kinda round it up to somewhere around 25%, 30ish if the service was great. I don't make that much money, but I just see it as part of making sure the restaurant ecosystem stays healthy and if my account is struggling, there's no shortage of amazing cheap eats around here.

1ox8jt6,https://i.redd.it/0oxksdj09a1g1.jpeg,My wife wrote a HaremLit book... It's a contemporary slice-of-life HaremLit called Breakwater Bound!,"Yep. You read that right, boys.

Earlier this year, my wife ( u/KayleeWestWrites ) lost her job to a layoff. And, it turns out, so have a lot of people. It's rough out there. While searching for a replacement, she joined my editing team full-time and started helping me make my books a lot better.

Then she decided she liked the books so much she wrote one on her own.

Breakwater Bound is a contemporary HaremLit series taking place in the real world (although it's a fake town) out on the Oregon coast. Here's some details:

* This is HaremLit, not erotica. Three hundred plus pages (about 100k words). Plot, romance, the works. Just real life.
* No FF, but will have threesomes. This isn't poly. And the MC is very clear about that.
* LIs are all 29 years old or older. One of them is a MILF, too.
* There's two LIs by the end of the first book, with two more planned.
* This series is low on internal drama. No cheating (obviously) but also no jealousy or infighting. Just some good, clean (but explicit) HaremLit fun.

The book is up for preorder now, and will be coming out November 24th!

Huge thanks to Rick for giving me the thumbs up on sharing this on Kaylee's behalf.

\*\*\*

**In a town that remembers everything, he's building something they'll never forget.**  
  
Luke Adams escaped Breakwater Bay, Oregon, twelve years ago to avoid **choosing between love and freedom**. Now his mother's stroke drags him home to find his family's legacy—Adams Marina—weeks from permanent closure.  
  
He's got days to fix the marina up so it can pass inspection. Tens of thousands in debt with no available funding. Environmental red tape that could stall him for months.  
  
The smart move is selling to developers and walking away clean.  
  
But there are **people worth staying for**. Faith fuels his mornings with coffee and fierce loyalty. Sav rallies the entire town behind his fight. Tessa teaches him to work with the system instead of against it. Even Claire, the ex who has every reason to hate him, is willing to give him a second chance.  
  
Luke is done choosing between people. He wants **all of them**, and he's building a life that doesn't force him to pick.

I wanted something that does more than just capture tasks. I wanted something that actually talks with me, helps me organize, schedule and plan inside TickTick when my brain is all over the place. So I have been building a small mobile app that does exactly that, with ADHD in mind.

Sharing it here in case it is useful for someone else.

# TL;DR

* You talk, it helps you organize, schedule and create tasks in TickTick
* Built for ADHD, task paralysis and scattered mind
* Mobile app, voice first, assistant, works with your system, not creating a new one
* Has different flows (Unstuck, Organize, Wind Down, Reflection) depending on how your brain feels
* Currently free while it is in Beta, transparent pricing later

# How it works with TickTick

* You connect your TickTick account once
* The app can:
   * Read your existing tasks, for example what is due today or this week
   * Help you prioritize and schedule them in a short conversation
   * Create new tasks when you remember things mid ramble
* You stay in TickTick for your normal day to day, this just adds a voice layer on top when your brain needs help

[Flows and settings](https://preview.redd.it/psjjxpu3ea1g1.png?width=5000&format=png&auto=webp&s=193e824278bb44220eae614fc2572a6690ff161e)

# Example: talk, then see it in TickTick

A typical moment for me:

* I say something like: “Tomorrow, get a haircut in the city center at 1 PM, vocal lesson at 6.”
* The app:
   * Gets to work immediately without double checking if it is clear
   * Asks clarifying questions to make it super easy to start working on the task when time comes if unclear
   * Creates the tasks directly in TickTick
      * `Get haircut in city center, 1:00 PM`
      * `Attend vocal lesson, 6:00 PM`

[BrightMind in actions - creating tasks in TickTick](https://preview.redd.it/1qhgydz6ea1g1.png?width=5000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f44a33b46517129caa6fe4aea68488e3d56b8e52)

# What this app actually is

It is called **BrightMind**, a small voice based ADHD co pilot that sits next to TickTick.

* **Mission**: help people with ADHD go from overwhelmed to in motion quickly
* **Voice first**: you talk like you would to a friend, it asks a few questions and turns that into a simple plan
* **Integrations**: works with TickTick (and Todoist)

# Flows designed for ADHD brains

Instead of one big do-everything mode, it has short flows you can start depending on what you need:

* **Unstuck**, quick mental reset to start one small thing in the next 2 minutes
* **Organize**, turn a messy brain dump and existing tasks into a realistic plan for today or for a project
* **Wind Down**, gentle evening or bedtime check in and getting you to sleep
* **Reflection**, short end of day review, what went well, what you want to tweak, what tomorrow you will thank you for

The idea is tiny steps, low friction, no judgment, just enough structure to help an ADHD brain move.

# Scheduled calls for accountability

If external structure helps:

* You can set scheduled calls like “call me at 9 PM to plan tomorrow”
* At that time, the app calls you, walks you through a quick flow and updates your tasks in TickTick accordingly

# Beta and link

BrightMind is in Beta right now and is free to use while in Beta.

I would really love feedback from other ADHD plus TickTick folks, what works for you, what feels off, what flows you wish existed.

showing up for people, caring about their lives, making thoughtful gifts for them, being proactive about spending quality time together — for me, it doesn’t even cross my mind NOT to do that for my friends, and yet it feels like I have to pull teeth to get someone else to care about me the same way. I practically have to beg people to come to events that are important to me, and even then they dip early. if I don’t reach out I think they would flat out just let the friendship disappear

I struggle to think of even a single friend in recent memory who’s cared about me to the same extent as I cared about them. communicating my feelings doesn’t work; the most I get is a vague apology and promise to do better (which never actually happens)

it’s happened so often at this point that I’m just… so tired. I know I care too much and I know I need to invest less in other people, but community is so important to me as someone who’s grown up friendless for the vast majority of her life. It never seems like anyone else struggles to get their friends to care about them, to think of them when they’re feeling down, to openly desire to spend time with them. I don’t know how they do it. I’m incredibly jealous of all those people surrounded by loved ones who plan thoughtful things for them. I’m not even looking for that. is it that agonizing to show up to even one of like… two things I plan all year? Maybe reach out to get a coffee? Follow up on those plans you keep flaking on? Show up to support me in something that’s deeply important to me? Idfk. Apparently it is or it wouldn’t keep happening!

before anyone says it: I do enjoy my own company, I have plenty of hobbies and go outside frequently, I speak to people all the time (I have two client-facing jobs). I have no trouble talking to people, my issue is actually getting anyone to give a shit. I shouldn’t have to beg someone to be a good friend",13,1763153839.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False
1ox8bpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ox8bpg/every_full_moon_my_roommates_eat_me_alive_and_it/,"Every full moon, my roommates EAT ME ALIVE and it IS my fault.","My roommates are no longer human. 

And neither am I. 

I thought they were embarrassed by their moon-drunk selves, but no. 

They were playing Silent Hill with my emaciated body. 

The moon's influence has moved past sending them into a trance-like state and acting moon-drunk. This was a whole other level of side effect. One they were trying and failing to hide with smiles and nonchalant faces. And I couldn’t stand it.

I was going to go fucking crazy.

Especially when the three of them were acting like the night before never happened. 

I needed answers.

Why we were replicating—and the numbers carved into mine and Rowan’s necks supposedly marking our copies.

Were Immie and Kaz the same?

I wasn’t going to find them staying in that house. Not in my state of mind, anyway. 

Paranoia had taken over like a virus, like a parasite leeching onto my brain. 

Conversations with them turned into a game of cat and mouse. 

Kaz cornered me in the kitchen to lecture me about leaving the refrigerator door open, and I felt… trapped. 

Like he was going to lunge at me any second, like he could sense my smell, the taste of fresh flesh on my bones ready for him to tear off. 

He looked normal enough, talking like usual, with a brow raised and the slight curve of a smirk on his lips. 

But I didn’t see intense hunger in his eyes. I didn’t see anything predatory. 

Kaz seemed like himself, like the guy I’d been living with for almost two years. 

And somehow, that made it worse. 

That made them good actors. Rowan and Immie were exactly the same, becoming the perfect mimics of the people I had grown to love. 

It was around midnight when I dragged myself down the stairs, shouldering a backpack with everything I could pack on such short notice. Yanking open the door and stepping over the threshold, I sucked in the cool night air. Before I could step out, however, a chuckle startled me.

Rowan. Standing in his robe, dark brown curls sticking up everywhere, he regarded me with dark eyes—and just for a moment, I wondered if he was going to drop the act.

Out of the three of them, Rowan was the one who struggled most with the façade.

I hadn’t forgotten the look of resentment and hatred he’d given me on the night of the full moon. The real him. 

Relief flooded me at the thought of him giving in and finally ripping off the mask. Instead, though, he folded his arms across his chest and took a step forward, still with that smile, a smile I knew was a grimace.

Rowan really wasn’t trying to hide his disdain for me.

Instinctively, I took a step back.

And like clockwork, he took another step forward, and another, until I could smell the coffee on his breath.

“It’s almost midnight,” Rowan said. If he noticed my panicked steps back, he didn’t say anything. “Where are you going?”

“The store,” I replied smoothly. “I need some fresh air.”

Rowan cocked his head, his lip curling. “At midnight?”

The door slammed shut in my face, and I resisted the urge to shriek.

“Yeah,” I hissed out. “I’m gonna get some food.”

“Hungry?” He gestured behind him. “Dude, Kaz just made veggie lasagna. Don’t you want that?”

“No,” I said. “I’m not hungry.”

“Uh-huh.” His lip curled. “So, what are you going to the store for?”

The gleam in his eye was driving me crazy. His whole expression, every contortion in his face, was challenging me to make more excuses.

The conversation was going nowhere, and somehow I could tell he was loving it; he was loving the fact that I was trembling, trying to stay calm, trying to stabilize my body. “Candy,” I said through my teeth. “I’m going to get some candy.”

Rowan hummed, an almost genuine smile pricking. I might have fallen for it if it wasn’t for how close he was standing to me, how he was cornering me. 

“Sweet. Get me some, would ya? There’s something about those gummy snakes that seriously slap.” 

He offered his hand for a high five, his gaze flicking to my backpack. He knew.

I knew he knew, and yet he wasn’t saying anything. He was playing with me. 

Rowan’s smile widened. “Hurry back, all right? There are some freaks out there, Nin. We don’t want you getting hurt now, do we?”

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine, and I forced a smile back.

Every instinct inside me told me to run. I had to get out. Away from him. From his coffee breath turning my gut, his erratic movements like he was ready to tear out my throat at any moment. I felt my body moving, my legs starting to work.

One step—and then another. I turned away from him. It took one single breath to reach the door, and another to remember how to grab the handle and twist it.

He was coming after me, I thought, my mind going into overdrive. 

I imagined his footsteps, heavy breath as he wrapped his hand around my arm and yanked me back inside, his teeth grazing the back of my neck. 

I forced my legs further until I was halfway down the path, reveling in the cool night air grazing my arms. 

When I pushed open the rickety gate which squealed under pressure, I risked turning back, my heart in my throat. 

In my head, Rowan was a monster bleeding back into the dark.

Turning around to face the house, though, there was nobody there. 

The door was still open, the hallway lit up in all-too-familiar golden light. 

But Rowan was gone. 

When I squinted, I could just about glimpse his figure moving back up the stairs in slow, almost defeated strides.

Something held me there for a second, staring at the house I always saw as a home and the people I saw as family. 

Before I turned and finally catapulted myself into a run. 

It’s not like I could go back to my parents' house.

They live across the state, and it was the middle of the night.

I had a friend from class. Sam. We used to be close, but a while ago he started to distance himself, only smiling at me in passing. 

We went from hanging out almost every day to barely talking, and I figured it was just natural for a friendship to crumble, even if I didn’t want it to. Sam got new friends, and I moved out of my dorms.

I could either turn up at his door and make a fool out of myself, or go back to my cannibal roommates. 

Making a fool out of myself, it was.

Sam lived in a large building with ivy crawling up red-brick. The house was old and crumbling, but cozy. 

I remembered freshman days, sitting under the late glow of the sun, the two of us spread out on a worn picnic blanket watching the July 4th fireworks in the sky. Before I could hesitate, I knocked three times. 

The windows were dark, so that wasn’t exactly comforting. 

Sam used to leave the door open so I could slip in whenever I wanted. Seeing it locked made my stomach twist.

Sure, it was midnight. Why *wouldn't* he lock it? 

I was frowning at a decaying dandelion when the door opened, and a pixie redhead stuck her head out. I recognized her automatically. Poppy. Sam’s roomie.

I had grown used to her over-the-top smiles and obsession with mini cacti, but this girl seemed like a different person. 

There was something else. Something I couldn’t put my finger on. 

The girl was fully dressed in a leather jacket over jeans and shirt, her collar glistening from the downpour I’d managed to miss. 

Half lidded eyes drank me in for a moment like she was in a daze before she seemingly snapped out of it, yanking the door open. 

“Nin?” Poppy’s gaze snapped to my feet. 

“Why are you barefoot?” She folded her arms. “Don't tell me you've got a weird fetish.”

I stared down at my feet, and she was right. I didn’t even put on shoes. The worst part is I barely felt the rough gravel between my toes and bare soles. 

I was numb on adrenaline. I shook my head with what I hoped was a smile. “Is Sam in?”

Something flashed across her face, and it was so fast I could barely read it. Poppy was quick to hide it with a smile. 

“Uhh, he's kind of busy right now.” Her attention went back to my feet. “More importantly, why are you running around with no shoes on?”

Before I could choke some kind of answer, the girl gestured me inside. “Get inside! Jesus, Nin, your feet!”

I managed a smile, stepping into the hallway. The house was exactly how I remembered it. Homely. Safe.

“Thanks.”

“What do you need Sam for?” Poppy asked, shutting and locking the door.

I shrugged, shivering. I didn’t realize how cold I was until I stepped into warmth. “Just to talk to him! You know, catch up.”

Poppy laughed. “About? You ran across campus to talk?” Her smile was teasing, and I’d missed it. “Nin, have you heard of texting?”

“I’m kind of locked out.”

Poppy’s smile faded. “Ah.” She cleared her throat, stepping aside. 

“Well, you know you’ve always got a home here if you’re ever in trouble.” she gestured over her shoulder. “Sammy is in the lounge.” 

Poppy led me into their kitchen and plonked a can of soda on the table. It was just like the old days. Poppy and I would hang in the kitchen drinking while Sam took a millennia to get ready. “You drink that. I'll drag Sam away from his game.” 

I nursed the can between my hands, rolling it around. *”Game?”*

Poppy rolled her eyes, yanking open the refrigerator with a little *too much* gusto and pulling out a beer. She cracked it open and took a sip through a  groan. 

“Urgh. They're in the middle of a tournament, or whatever. It started last night, and it’s still going. You’d think grown adults would do something more interesting with their time, but alas, I digress.” Poppy set the can down. “I’ve been trying to sleep for the last few hours, but they’re pretty loud. I just block them out with whatever’s on Netflix.”

Cracking open my soda, I downed half of it. God, there was nothing better than a frosty Coke. Rowan and I used down bottles of them for our failed Tik-Tok account. We stopped doing it when he had to get his stomach pumped.

“Tournament?” I said through a mouthful. 

I couldn’t help noticing her attire, and her claim about not being able to sleep suddenly seemed dubious. What, had she been sleeping fully dressed?

Poppy smirked and perched herself on the edge of the table. ""Just a nerd game,"" she said dismissively. ""Sam’s friends are quite… odd.""

I glanced at her jacket, still glistening. ""Have you been outside?""

""Outside?"" Her expression crumpled before she realized what I meant. 

""Oh. Oh, yeah. I went for a walk."" She grabbed her beer. ""Hey, why don’t we head into the lounge instead, huh? I’m sure Sam wouldn’t mind us interrupting him.""

With a mischievous glint in her eyes, she spun around and grabbed my arm. ""Besides! Sammy’s friends have been here long enough.""

As she pulled me into the lounge, I caught a fleeting glimpse of... something.

I didn’t see much, just enough to know it wasn’t some typical Dungeons and Dragons game.

Papers were strewn across the table. A group of people, including Sam, was gathered around, one of them marking something on the paper.

Sam’s other housemates were conspicuously absent. When Poppy walked in, dragging me along, the group quickly turned to block my view, hurriedly clearing papers and shutting laptops. 

It felt like I’d just walked into something I wasn’t supposed to see. Poppy, however, seemed delighted by their reaction. 

""Oh, Saaaammmyy,"" she sang, leaning against the door with a smile. ""You have a visitor.""

Sam looked different, though I couldn’t put my finger on why. 

His light sandy hair was tied into its usual clumsy ponytail, but the look on his face was one I’d never seen before. 

Flustered, his cartoonishly wide eyes blinking at me like I was a hallucination. 

Like Poppy, he was fully dressed. Sam murmured something to the group, and they quickly gathered stained coffee mugs and bits of paper, clearing the table.

Poppy, now slumped into a beanbag, shot me a grin. ""And then there were three!” 

She stretched out like a cat and squealed when Sam threw a cushion at her. ""We finally have our house back!""

""You know I have the lounge until two,"" he retorted, continuing to tidy up.

Poppy mimicked his voice, her body melting into the beanbag. *""You know I have the lounge until two.""*

""What did I tell you about mimicking me?"" Sam shot her a glare, exasperated.

The girl chuckled. ""Hey, it’s fun.""

""It’s not fun when you sound absolutely nothing like me.”

“Cry about it, Sammy.”

Their back and forth reminded me of my own roommates.

His lip curled into the slightest of smiles, and he picked up another cushion to throw. “Poppy.”

“Sam.” She shot back in a mocking exaggeration of his accent.

Sam’s accent never failed to take me by surprise. Hard Aussie. When I first met him I could barely understand him.

It didn’t help that upon first meeting him, he talked like he’d been fast forwarded.

Originally from Victoria, Sam Fuller was my first friend. 

That’s how we became close, actually. His amusement at my failure to understand him. Poppy folded her arms, her gaze trailing after the group filing out of the room. They were mixed ages, though none of them were Sam’s. 

They all looked to be middle aged to ancient. I glimpsed a woman who looked to be at least 70 stride to the door. “Don’t give me that look.” Poppy said.

“Your weird friends can find another meeting place for your games. I want to sleep. Allie and Tom have locked themselves in their rooms since you decided to invite half of the neighborhood.”

“They’re not weird games. We’re saving the town.” Sam shooed Poppy out of the room. “Don’t you have work to do?” 

“Maybe.” Poppy nodded at me. “I’ll make you another drink.” Her gaze fell on Sam. “Beer?”

He grinned. “That’d be great.""

“Awesome!” Poppy playfully hit him. “Get one yourself. You’re a big boy, aren’t cha? I’ll be in my room!”

Ignoring Poppy slamming the door behind her, Sam’s attention flicked to me. “Nin, what are you doing here?”

I couldn’t help it, the words slipping out before I could stop them. “Who were they?”

Sam dragged his hands through his hair. “Just friends.” His expression softened, and the knot in my gut loosened.

“You look like shit, Nin. What happened?”

I figured telling him a diluted version of the night of the full moon was better so I didn’t sound out of my mind.  

By the time I was finished explaining, the two of us were curled up on his bed in front of his laptop playing YouTube videos on low. Poppy had lent me some clothes to sleep in, and I was ready to pass out. Sam sat in front of me, his arms wrapped around his knees. 

“So, your roomies got you freaked?” He frowned, his sleepy eyes on me. “What did they do?”

Cannibalise my body. I thought dizzily.

No, worse. They weren’t just eating me.

They were replicating me, so they could eat me again, and again, and again, and—

“They were just acting weird.” I said.

“Weird *how*?”

Hours later, when I was falling asleep, and Sam was watching YouTube, he nudged me.

“Nin?”

“Mm?” I mumbled into his pillow.

“Where do you live now? Like, which house?”

“It’s just down the road from here.”

He hummed. “And those roommates…who are they again?”

I didn’t answer him.

I mean, I couldn’t.

Their names were entangled on my tongue whenever I tried.

Sam asked me the same question every day, and the words tangled in my throat. 

I told him it was a prank gone wrong, and that seemed to appease him.

But his expression never seemed to believe me, forcing a smile and nodding. 

Like a parent reassuring a child everything was going to be okay. 

A week flew by in a confusing blur, and I went to class as usual, staying at Sam’s until I could find a more permanent place. 

Much to Poppy’s delight, Sam didn’t invite his friends over again. Instead, he insisted on video games and takeout every night.

It was like freshman year again, and I found myself drowning out the thoughts and questions still haunting me with alcohol and drunk games of Risk.

Classes were more or less the same, but they were a good distraction.

I got texts and missed calls from Immie, and Kaz and Rowan were blowing up the group chat with “?????” messages. 

I muted it and ignored my phone. There would be a point when I’d go back, I thought. After all, I had to know what was wrong with them, why the moon afflicted that kind of behavior, and just what exactly they had done to me. 

But it wouldn’t be yet. 

I can’t remember what day it was when I fully came to reality, badly hungover and feeling sick to my stomach.

Class was ending, and as usual, I filed out of the hall, heading to where Sam usually met me before we went to his house. My head was spinning, a striking pain rattling my skull.

I’d suffered from hangover headaches before, but this was something new. Swallowing two Tylenol with the cold coffee I’d had in my backpack all day wasn’t a good idea. 

Slumping down on the stairs leading to the main reception, I fought against a cry. The pain was like nothing I’d felt before, like someone had plunged a lead pipe through my brain and stirred my brain into a soupy mess. 

Luckily, Sam joined me quickly, his smile dampening when he saw my expression. 

“Oh, man.” He felt my forehead. “You look like you’re going to barf everywhere.”

Despite the pain, I managed a smile. “Do I look like a zombie?”

I could practically hear the cogs in his head turning. Sam dragged a hand through his hair. “Will you hit me if I say yes?”

I shooed him away when he held up his hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

“Fifteen.” I rolled my eyes. I meant to say that we should head down the stairs because I was feeling progressively sicker by the second and felt like I was going to faint, the world around me becoming a blur of colors and faint noises I could barely decipher. 

A sudden loud slam, however, pricked my ears. It didn’t seem to alert the crowd of students, merely a whisper in a room full of loud chatter and laughter. 

To me though, it was a sound I knew all too well. 

Lifting my head, I scanned the crowd enveloping the hallway. 

Sam was speaking behind me, but his voice collapsed into a low buzz of white noise bleeding into my muddled brain. 

I knew that sound. The sound of skin hitting glass, or wood, sometimes plastic. The sound of slipping on a rug, or tripping on literal *air.*  There was nobody else it  would be but my chronically clumsy roommate. 

Which meant he was on campus, and I had zero idea how to confront him about the *cannibalism* thing. 

He wasn't what you'd expect a monster to look like—especially not one you knew had already killed and eaten you multiple times. It was all about perspective. 

To a passerby, he seemed like an ordinary college student, a dishevelled one who had just stumbled headlong into an automatic door, leaving a glaring red bruise in the center of his forehead. 

But to me, Rowan Beck was a monster surrounded by fresh meat. 

The students pushing past him were a blur to me, but to *him*, I caught his gaze drinking each one in, his nose flaring when a guy sauntered past him. 

From a distance, my roommate appeared unchanged, wearing a faded, threadbare t-shirt bearing a logo that had long since peeled away, a pair of well-worn jeans with frayed edges and a patch over one knee.  So much for his *pretentious phase.* 

The glasses were a *choice*.

His dark brown curls were tousled and unkempt, partially hidden under a baseball cap that looked like it had seen better days. But as he drew nearer, I could see his mask slowly starting to crumble. 

His wide smile faltering, twitching into a grimace. 

His cheeks looked hollow, gaunt even. Like something was sucking the life from him. 

Closing in on me, his penetrating gaze hidden behind a pair of raybans, my mediocre lunch crept up my throat. 

I stepped back, scanning for am exit.

And like he had read my mind, his steps quickened. 

He was still wearing that disguise. Still mimicking my best friend. 

Hiding whatever spell he was under.

Rowan oozed broke college student who hadn’t showered in days. 

In his hand was a to-go cup of hot cocoa--which was my favorite. 

Rowan knew that. It had been my  coffee order every time we studied there as a four.  

“Yooo, Nin! Sup!"" Rowan was attracting stares as he sort of danced towards me, tripping over his feet, only for him to steady himself with a grin. 

His words were slurred slightly when he handed me the drink, and he stumbled, managing to right himself. He wasn’t moon-drunk, I thought.

Actually drunk.

“Hey.” Sam nudged me. I noticed he’d stiffened up. “That's your roommate? Rowan Beck?"" 

I didn’t get a chance to reply, with Rowan situating himself right in front of me, swaying a little.

“Now call me craaaaazy!” My roommate said in a slurred giggle. 

He stumbled again, and this time my hand shot out to steady him on impulse. I caught the flash of disgust on his face. 

Still wearing that smile, he swiped my hand off of his shoulder. 

“But I’m getting the vibe you’re avoiding us! Which is like, sooo rude. You could have just sent us a text, but noooo, you decided to be cool and mys-te-ri-ous.""

I took the drink hesitantly. “Are you drunk?” 

Rowan cocked his head. He had that stupid smile again. The one he pulled during a full moon. Outside though, it was daylight, the sun shining in the sky.  

“Drunk? You think I can get drunk? Nah man, I just feel kinda shit. He shrugged. “I haven’t been eating great the last few days. Not eating can fuck a guy up. Right Nin?”

Every word penetrated like a knife, and suddenly it was hard to fucking breathe.

My roommate turned to Sam. “Ooh, I know you!"" He spread out his arms, a choked laugh escaping his lips. ""You’re the guy who wrote that fucking article about us!” 

Rowan was causing a scene and he didn't give a shit. I couldn't tell if he was moon drunk, or just more insane than usual. 

He jumped in front of Sam, with the kind of manic energy which was still him, and yet cranked to 100. 


“Loved it, Fuller! You're a literary genius! Especially when you called us ‘evil body snatching demons’ who should be burned at the stake. A truly riveting read.""  

Sam’s expression stayed stoic. “Rowan.” He said my roommate's name like poison. “Where’s Kaz?”

“Playing COD, probably.” Rowan’s lips curled into a smirk. He leaned close to the guy, raising an eyebrow, his words more of a breathy laugh. “Why? Do you want me to pass a message to him?”

Sam stepped back. “Nin, I gotta go."" He said, pulling out his phone. “I’ll speak to you later.”

“Right.” I panicked. “Am I still okay to stay?”

“I’m… I’m busy.” Sam nodded at me, ignoring Rowan, before stumbling back into the crowd. “Come by later, all right?”

He was gone before I could open my mouth.

“Aww, noooo. Don't gooooo.” Rowan mocked a pout, turning to me. 

“Damn. Did he seem… offended? By my presence?"" He waved Sam away with a grin. ""Anyway! Imogen is making dinner tonight. She’s bought all the ingredients for something she saw on Pinterest, so I’m not holding my breath that it’ll be good—or even edible.” 

I didn’t fight back when he slipped his hand in mine, pulling me down the stairs. 

His tone was already puppeteering my limbs. 

My roommate twisted around, shooting me a sheepish smile. 

“Okayyyy, you got me! I should probably apologize for the other night.”

I was already backing away, pulling away from him.

“I don’t care what you have to say.” I said in a breath. “I’m staying with my parents.”

“You mean halfway across the state?” Rowan’s hand tightened around my arm. ""Come on. We just want to talk.”

“Talk?”

That got my attention. Following him to his car parked out front, I slipped into the passenger seat.

I was aware I was following the big bad wolf into the forest, every horror movie cliché.

But what other choice did I have?

I needed answers. Maybe he was finally going to tell me what the fuck was going on. Rowan was still my roommate. 

I had lived with him for two years. I needed to know what was going with them. Why were they like this? And why, according to him, this was my fault. 

Rowan jumped into the drivers seat and started the car, dragging his hand through his hair. “Yeah.” He said. “I mean, once again we left you on a full moon and I bet it sucked. But hey,” He chuckled. 

“At least you didn’t see us moon-drunk again.” My housemate sent me a mocking look, “Wait, did you? Oh, man, what did I do this time? The last thing I remember is playing Monopoly, and I think at some point I cuffed you to your bed.”

Twisting around to face him, my heart slithered into my throat. The bastard was still playing his games.

“You’re still saying that?” I hissed. “Moon drunk?”

Rowan’s gaze didn’t leave the road. “I mean, yeah.” He murmured, “You said we freak you out, so we keep our distance.”

Rowan didn’t speak for most of the ride, and I spent the majority of it trying to find out how to jump out of a moving car without seriously injuring myself. 

My phone vibrated and I pulled it out, glimpsing a text heading my notifications bar.

Sam: Sent: 4:05PM.

“That thing is NOT Rowan Beck. Get out of that house.”

Another message:

Sam: Sent: 4:06PM: “GET OUT, NIN. GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE.”

Instinctively, I grabbed for the handle, pawing for a way out. 

I felt like I was on fire, my body moving closer to the door, leaning into it, as if it would magically fucking open for me. 

“You okay?” Rowan murmured. He slipped off his raybans and turned to me. 

That same gleam was in his eyes, that sliver of moonlight. 

He looked worse without the raybans, bloodshot eyes, a mixture of burst blood vessels and moonlight haloing his iris. 

My roommate looked beautiful and horrifying at the same time, a mixture of human and inhuman; the shell of the guy I thought I knew filled with her. But there was something else, something I didn’t understand. His skin looked… cracked. 

Like it was splintering apart. 

And in those cracks was what I imagined pins and needles to look like. Static. 

There was static leaking from the cracks, spider webbing across his pasty skin. 

Rowan sighed when I couldn’t bring myself to answer. 

“You know,” he said, his hands tapping the steering wheel. ""Eating makes me feel better. It... “ He took a long breath, tapping out a tune. “Well, it takes the memories away, you know? Makes me feel so fucking good.” He tipped his head back, eyes rolling back, like he was in euphoria.

“Rowan.” I managed to get out. 

His eyes flickered shut at a red light. “You would not believe how good the human skull tastes when mixed with intestines. Oh my god, the crunch! It's fucking *insane*. Your skin is my favorite part.""

He tapped a beat with his shoe. ""Damn, you taste good. Like chicken! But a little sour.”

When I grabbed for the door handle, one arm whipped out, pinning me to the seat, the other straying on the wheel. 

He was unsurprisingly strong, his heavy weight restraining me against cool leather. “The flesh under Kaz’s bed is good. I mean, it’s a little soggy and gross on the outside. It’s not peak meat, but it’s tolerable. If you ask me honestly, I’d say I prefer you refrigerated.” 

His lips split into a grin. “And we’re saving those for a good game of Smash.”

“Rowan.” I heard myself say his name again, straining against his arm.

“You said we should talk.” He deadpanned. 

Outside, the world went by as normal, the evening rush hour flying by in a blur of vivid reds and oranges. “So, that’s what we’re going to do.” He whistled. “Talk.”

Words appeared in my throat, but they wouldn’t form on my tongue. 

He surprised me with a laugh. And with that laugh, his façade was shattered. 

He’d finally ripped off his mask. “Why did you have to come downstairs?” 

Rowan finally twisted to me, his lips curled into a grin, his eyes telling a different story. So many emotions. Past emotions. Emotions from a time ripped from my memory. Hatred and pain, anger and something else entirely I couldn’t read. 

“All you had to do was stay in your fucking room, and we wouldn’t have to… have to remember. We could go on living together. You, me, Kaz and Immie. And yeah, when I’m agitated or it’s nearing totality, I start to remember pieces of it.” His voice broke, which was so unlike him.

So haunted, so hollow and wrong. “Why I… why I fucking despise you, Nin.” He was trembling, and when I dared look, his skin was slowly coming apart, a cocktail of moonlight and static pouring out. 

I was frozen. I couldn’t fucking move. Rowan grabbed the wheel with both hands, his knuckles turning white. 

He’d let me go, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. Not when he’d said that. 

Not when his words had stirred something in me. Still though, he kept speaking—like him—the real him—had been silenced for so long, and here he was, letting it all out. 

“She takes all the bad away,” he whispered, a dreamy smile spreading across his lips. 

“As long as we eat, I don’t feel anything at all. I don’t have to fucking think or breathe, and I can look at you with rose-tinted glasses and a foggy brain. It’s fucking bliss. Like I’m….drowning.” Rowan sighed, dragging his hand through his hair. 

“Not now,” he said. “Now, she’s punishing me because I haven’t eaten.”

The car swerved around a truck, and I fought against my own body, fighting to grab the wheel. But I was frozen. 

“Now, I remember.” His tone was poison spitting from his tongue. 

“She made us remember, and it’s… it’s fucking there in my head,” His voice strained, and he stabbed at his left temple. “Right here! It’s right fucking here, Nin, and I can’t… I can’t stop it. I can’t stop her. She’s in my... my head.”

Rowan didn’t look at me. In fact, he was actively avoiding making eye contact.

Tears were welling in his eyes, hysterical tears leaking that same buzzing black and white static. “She’s in my head. Always in my head. Singing, man. Singing at the top of her voice.”

“What did I do?” I didn’t mean to say it. 

The car swerved again, and I braced myself against the seat. “Rowan, you keep telling me I did something.” I managed. “Why can’t you tell me?”

My roommate turned to me, his eyes filled with that unearthly light I knew he’d been trying to avoid for months.

His smile was suddenly maniacal. Not his. Someone else's. “Because it’s fun!”

This time I did grab for the wheel, trying to shove him from his seat. “Stop the fucking car.”

Rowan easily got the upper hand, grasping it. “No. Like I said, we’re going home. And.. and we’re going to talk.”

It was me who laughed this time. “Talk?” I spluttered. “You mean eat me. Copy me. Whatever you do.”

I couldn’t control my emotions. I laughed. It felt good. ""You suck at being a serial killer."" 

I managed to take him off guard for a moment. He blinked before regaining control. “It’s not… like that. Jesus fucking Christ.”

""Then what is it?” I spat back, days of repressed emotions rushing to the surface. 

“I catch you eating me, and what am I supposed to think? Did you guys seriously think I’d just go along with whatever this is? Are you trying to shield me, is that it?” 

I was laughing, and I couldn’t stop. 

And at that moment I realized we were both under her spell. Both of us were screaming at each other. 

Rowan, leaking her light, and me, bathing in it. 

It hit me, then, that I was as inhuman as him. 

Whatever the moon had done, it was affecting both of us. 

I just didn’t have the cannibalistic tendencies he had. 

“I caught you chewing on what I presume was my *twenty sixth* body! What the fuck do you think you can shield me from?” 

Rowan surprised me with a scoff. “I’m sorry, *shield* you?” He turned to me fully, and I realized, my stomach creeping into my throat, that he wasn’t looking at the road. 

“Are you fucking *kidding* me?” My roommate choked out. “I want you to remember!” He yelled. “Do you think I like looking at you, knowing that you’re completely oblivious about what you… about what you did to us? No, it fucking hurts! You think I *want* to play happy families with you?” Rowan was cracking. 

I wasn't sure if that was good or bad. 

I noticed him inching away from me. 

“That's why I *eat*, Nin. That’s why we eat. She numbs those feelings. Those thoughts. She only makes us think about the good.”

When his hands slammed into the steering wheel, I finally caught a sliver of humanity coming back to fruition on his face.

My hand slipped from the handle, and I heard myself speak. “What did I *do*?”

But Rowan’s eyes were on the road again. He squinted, and reality seeped in. “What the fuck is *that*?”

No longer on the main road, we were heading into darkness, an empty stretch of oblivion I didn’t recognise. There were no signs of cars. I swallowed. “What did you see?""

Rowan shook his head, blinking rapidly. “Nothing.” He said. “I think I’m… seeing things—”

Whatever Rowan was about to say was cut off suddenly, followed by a blinding flash which felt and sounded like the world had been ripped apart in front of us.

Something was there, blinding me, searing my eyes from my skull. 

But I had no time to scream, no time to think or breathe. 

Before I could, my mind was working, and dizzying thoughts were hitting me. 

Our car had hit something, and that something was powerful enough to propel me into the air, my roommate's car shredded apart. The world was shattering around me, my body caught in a whirlwind. 

The sensations were too real, too real to be feeling them. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel this. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel my body being ripped apart, and still be self-aware enough to screech into nothing, a nothing which existed when my head had been ripped from my torso. I wasn't supposed to– 

Exist. 

I waited to die. 

Without a brain, without a body, I waited for the dark. And yet somehow, I didn’t fall fully. Instead of plunging into the dark, my body was still mine. It still had a head.

A torso.

It was still mine when it hit something with a sickening crack.

Concrete.

Dying kind of feels like melting. I was aware my eyes were snapping open for a moment, something wet and warm spreading around me and trickling from my lips. 

I could taste rust, and I couldn't stop it. My vision was blurry, too blurry to make sense of anything. I watched my eyelids flickering, like they were unsure what to do.

The sky was pretty. I think I tried to name a star, before everything just kind of… melted. 

It was the 28th time I’d died, and this was the first time I really felt it. 

Melting. 

I melted into the ground, my body and thoughts fragmenting. 

Before whatever had taken me choked me back out. 

Death had rejected me. 

After a disorienting moment of *nothing*, trapped between nothing and something, awareness came back to me in splinters, reality bleeding back into focus. I could feel the breeze tickling my back. 

I had…moved.

I was no longer where I’d landed on my back after being propelled from the car in the crash.

Now I was lying on my stomach. 

Something tickled my face. 

Grass. 

I was lying face down on the side of the road.  

I can’t describe the sensation it was to awaken only being part real. 

When I sat up, I felt real. 

I felt like I was part of this universe. 

But looking down at myself, I resembled a ghost, both see-through and not. Prodding at my skin, that same static bleeding from Rowan’s face worked effortlessly, carving my outline and stitching me back together. 

My body was a brand new copy of the me before the crash. 

I even saw the coffee stain on my shirt. The smear of pen I’d drawn on the back of my hand when I was bored in class.

I felt nothing. Like I was made of stars. 

Hollow.

Something was missing, though, a cavern in my mind beginning its purge.

Do you know when you wake up from a dream, and it slips away as you regain consciousness?

That’s what it felt like. Like everything which had happened, the crash, everything Rowan said—was a dream.

Once I felt more like myself, and when my fingertips could touch real objects, wet gravel and grass, my own skin, I shakily got to my feet. I found my old body at the side of the road. I’d bled out, just like I thought. My eyes were still wide open, still struggling to name that constellation. 

When I crawled over to it, I couldn’t resist, grasping hold of her hand, only to get a flash. Like I was seeing her POV. 

She was my old body’s memories. I saw Rowan’s expression, his skin splintering apart, his eyes filled with moonlight. 

I saw him struggling with the wheel, and then the crash. Letting go of her ice-cold hand, I let out a sharp breath, her memories flashing out of existence. 

I didn’t have time to think about what I’d seen—about the questions piling in my skull, taking over my thoughts. 

Rowan was still in the car, his body twisted like a pretzel, my roommate’s head smashed against the wheel spattered with gore, his brain leaking from his ears. 

“Rowan.”

I stopped shaking him when I realized his spine had snapped, his body more liquid than solid. 

When I felt for a pulse, it was still there, but faint, as sharp red pooled around him, sticking to his hair and drenching his skin and clothes. His head lolled to the side, and I saw and *felt* that final breath escape his lips. When I crawled out of the wreck of his car, I dropped onto my knees. 

There it was again. 

This time it was louder, completely unmistakable. The sound of a photograph being taken.

When that light filled my eyes once again, I turned away from the car wreck, blinking through intense light. 

It was at the back-end of that sound, the sound of a photo snapping reality and stealing away a moment, when I glimpsed the body seemingly bleeding into existence right in front of me. Like a polaroid coming to life. 

Stumbling over to him, I found Rowan curled into himself, and like me, he was made up of static, which became flesh, which became skin, spreading across him, making a perfect copy, an exact replica of the dead guy in the wreck. 

He was beautiful, like a shadow coming to life, a sketch bleeding into a human. 

Hesitantly, I reached out and brushed dark curls out of the way, hair which was still shadows and shapes seeping into  contorted reality. This time the number 3 was carved into his skin—and by the look of it, the number was fresh, only just coming into existence. 

Did my asshole roommate just *respawn*? 

After a moment of just… watching him, watching my roommate be brought to life, his chest rising and falling, eyelids flickering, lips parting, I got a hold of myself and tried to grab him. 

But when I was sure my hands had made contact with him, flesh with flesh, something smashed into the back of my head, and stars filled my vision. 

I hit the ground, barely physical. Which made me easier to capture. 

I was being dragged, my bare arms burning across rough concrete, before a shadow was looming over me, something cold suffocating my nose and mouth. 

In the corner of my eye, I glimpsed an adult figure lifting  Rowan into their arms, his body still flickering in and out of existence. 

Before I could cry out, I was forced to inhale, choking on what smelled like lemons. 

Before my body went limp, and I allowed myself to be dragged into the pitch dark.",3,1763153831.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1ox8a5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ox8a5o/machine_produces_awful_coffee_sage_oracle_jet/,Machine produces awful coffee [Sage Oracle Jet],"Hi all,

I’ve been using the Sage Oracle Jet since July and I’m honestly not sure if I’ve got a faulty unit or if this is just how it performs.

I’ve tried everything I can think of — fresh beans from solid UK roasters (Origin, etc.), filtered water, different milks, adjusting grind size, dose, shot times… the lot. But I’m still getting wildly inconsistent results. One shot pulls 7ml, the next 40ml, same beans, same settings. Pucks range from nice dry discs to straight-up soup. Every now and then I’ll get a half-decent espresso, but I can’t seem to recreate it reliably.

A few other issues:

Espresso is often lukewarm (~57°C straight after pulling)

Sometimes it just hums and nothing comes out

Occasionally only works after switching off and on again — and then only for one shot


I’ve followed Sage’s troubleshooting guide and done the full descale (including the 5-hour one), but none of it seems to fix the problems.

So now I’m wondering:
Would a different Sage machine (up to £1500) actually be more reliable, or should I be looking at other brands entirely?

I’m fine with a bit of tinkering — I’m not expecting a push-button miracle — but I also don’t want to feel like I need a lab coat every morning just to make a half-decent coffee. Just want a decent espresso!!!

Would love to hear from anyone with experience or suggestions. Cheers!",1,1763153725.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I have a trainee who is temporarily running one of my stores, while the tenured manager does some pet projects to give her that development time period.

There’s a full timer in the store that I wasn’t aware had a deal worked out with the store manager that he works 4 days a week, no more than 32 hours. The trainee was also not aware of this, so she scheduled him extra hours per the deal, but approx. 40 hour weeks per being FT.

He went to her the other day and said he was going to put in his 2 weeks because he felt overworked. She obviously got taken aback, spoke to him about how the regular manager is coming back soon because she’s about to leave training, and apologized pretty thoroughly.

I ended up pulling him into the office to check behind what’s going on since an out of the blue resignation was not on my radar for this FTer. I told him that if he ever has concerns that aren’t being met that I’d like to know and it’s an important part of my job that he feels heard if something isn’t being addressed. I asked him to describe his availability and asked if the trainee was aware of it. He said she was, and told me he needs Tuesday’s and Thursdays off, which was happening. I asked if there were any other classes or obligations we’re scheduling over, and he said he has recitation on Friday evenings, which he did have shifts for. I told him while I don’t make the schedule personally, I will touch base with the trainee and ensure things are more similar to what he’s used to in the store. He ended up saying it’s okay because he knows it’s difficult to get coverage that soon and I said we’d make it happen.

I communicated to the trainee I’d like to prioritize getting him that Friday evening off to ensure he felt heard by us and like his other responsibilities do matter to us, even though he had told me he doesn’t technically need the Friday evening. I had a pretty lengthy coaching discussion about scheduling, hours budgeting, and how most of my store managers typically work with that process.

Today, I saw the FTer was on the schedule for Friday evening. The trainee ended up telling me that she coordinated a shift swap and went to tell him. He then said he doesn’t need Friday off because he doesn’t go to recitation anyways. She said, “Oh, I thought you had a conversation with \[my name\].” He said, “Well, it wasn’t much of a conversation as her talking at me.” Bless her heart, the trainee said she found it weird because it sounded really unlike me, but she also does speak to me more regularly, so her impression is going to be very different.

Here’s my question: What would you have done about this situation? I’m not sure what would’ve helped alleviate his concerns. I’m not that annoyed about the comment itself, but more wondering if anyone can give insight into his headspace. I used to work significant hours at a coffee shop when I was a student, and had a schedule that he may be surprised is extremely similar to what he’s doing. So while I relate to his needs, I’m surprised he felt so unheard, as that’s how I would’ve wanted my manager to react when I felt like my scheduling wasn’t being performed properly (which is a situation I encountered). I would’ve just skipped the class and stayed at home if I was set on skipping class, which trust me, I had done plenty of times before.

I come from a family of vampire hunters, but they’re all bad at their job (parts 1-5) I’m almost done with the story! If you like this please show it some love. This is my first story I’ve ever written, I take constructive criticisms 

Post 1: 

Hi, my name is John Helsing. And you’re probably thinking, “Helsing? Like Van Helsing, the vampire hunter?” 
And well, kinda 
The truth is, no one knows if a direct descendant of Van Helsing is even alive. 
No, in my case, my great great great great (not sure how many greats) grandfather, Wendel Stumpf, was an aspiring vampire hunter. But he had no reputation, and definitely not the skill to build his own. So he simply started calling himself a Helsing, the actual Helsing bloodline was coated in so much secrecy that no one opposed him. Our whole bloodline has since dedicated themselves to upholding their “sacred order”, but historically they haven’t done too well. 
My great grandfather died at the ripe age of 26. He had shot a silver bullet at his target vampire, missed and hit a particularly hearty boulder, which then ricocheted into his own skull. In another instant, a Helsing from the great era of cowboys and banditos, snagged his weapon on his suspenders when he went for the draw. The “hunted” vampire had drained him like a raisin before he even cleared leather. So no, I’m not interested in upholding our family’s long standing tradition. 
Even when I was inducted into the order at the age of 7, I didn’t want anything to do with this shit. My immediate family, my mother, father, and older brother, however, are devout zealots. See their issue is that they actually DO kill vampires, if they always failed I’m sure they would’ve quit. But just because they  manage to kill 1 out of every 10 they hunt, it’s enough to justify their foolish crusade. 
But now everything’s changed. Because just this morning, the volcano that sits on the outside of our small little mountain town, has erupted, and clouds of ash are blocking out the sun. 

Post 2: 

It’s been a day now, since shit hit the fan. When I heard the volcano erupt I was still in bed, drooling puddles in my pillow. It was loud (obviously) but it was also long. It started like a cannon, then waves of horrendous thunder, followed by crackling. like someone was crushing and ripping pieces of tinfoil right beside your ear, over and over and over. This continued for several minutes before the sound dwindled into a low gurgle. I hesitated to go outside, at the time I wasn’t sure what had happened, if it was even safe to go outside. But I could see from my window, plumes of ash covering the sky like a layer of dense fog. Thick enough to block out the sun. With the town now in complete darkness, a deep red and orange glow was visible emanating from behind the lining mountains. The glow crept slowly along the mountains, until it had fully surrounded the town. Many townsfolk had proclaimed it a miracle that no erupted lava had come plummeting into town. But I’m wondering now if that fate would have met us better. 

In the following half hour, townsfolk began exiting their homes and workplaces cautiously investigating the situation. Ash poured down like rain, and laid like snow. Thick heaps of ash littered roofs and soot covered every visible inch of the town. Everything lit by a harsh, angry red. 

I left my bedroom and entered the living room, where I found my family gearing up. My older brother had strapped so many bottles of holy water to his chest that he drooped forward slightly. My mother placed a foot on the coffee table and slid a silver dagger into her boot sheath. Once my dad was finished covering himself in more armor than three knights combined, he grabbed The Cruciphalanx that leaned against the lazy boy. 
 “My son” he growled 
“War is not coming soon, no! War is upon us now. It is here. You must prepare yourself, there is no option. “
He handed me The Cruciphalanx. A large two handed weapon, similar to that of a greataxe, doubled sided in the shape of a large cross. It glistened in the low light of the candles.  
“You are of Helsing blood, my son. From now forth denial will only lead to a hollow death” 
I always hate when he speaks like that, his day job is a cashier at the local general store. 
Then the first scream came, piercing through the walls and echoing throughout the house. My mother  spoke up and placed a hand on my shoulder 
“ the people of this town are our friends, and our neighbors. But they are also our family. Whatever happens out there, I’m proud of you John, and I love you very much.” 

Post 3: 

I know my last entry ended rather abruptly, and maybe that upset you guys. But I don’t give a shit. Because as I was typing away, a ghastly fiend had snuck up on me and yanked me to the ground. It was pulling my collar down and opening its jaws in anticipation, long and dirty thumbnails digging into my neck. I managed to reach an arm under its neck and gripped tightly against their temple. I gouged that fuckers eye out with my thumb, It screeched like a cheetah and writhed in pain. No killing blow but it was enough for it to loosen its grip on me. I arched by back and fumbled for my knife in its scout carry position. Once it was loose I quickly plunged it in the back of its bald and wrinkly head. The wrinkles looked like sagging skin, but they gripped my knife so tight it stuck. But yeah, maybe next time I’m attacked I’ll type “ARGHHHHHHHHHHJAOFGBEOQIAHEK” so you know something happened to me. Anyway, back to yesterday morning.

My family hurried to get outside, my dad sounding like 50 pots and pans, and my brother clanking around like a backpack full of mason jars. My mother was the first to reach the door. She was the only sensible one, carrying only what she needed. She was light and agile, the only one of the family to have successfully slain a beast. Watching them rush, I found myself clumsily jogging towards the door as well. My mother was right , this town is our home and these people are our family. 

Upon reaching the neighborhood street, we saw a small crowd of townsfolk huddled up about 50 feet away. We hurried close to investigate. The crowd was gathered in a circle and opened up when we approached. A man, the bank teller Nathan, disbanded himself from the crowd and looked to my father. In a quiet and shaken voice he spoke, 
     “ it’s Agatha… she, she’s hurt real bad. I mean, god… worse than bad, I mean she’s d-d-dead. We heard her scream and found her here pale as a ghost. She’s all shriveled up… her fingers are bent backwards and her arms and legs are stretched and contorted something awful….” 
Tears rolled down his face, they shined red in the light. Nathan was on the verge of a complete breakdown.  He was shaking like a stray dog, damp and cold, hiding underneath a park bench and whimpering in the deafening rain. And of course he was, Agatha was his aunt, and WAS the only family he had left. 

My father’s boss glanced towards us and did a quick double take. 
 “Leroy? What the actual fuck are you wearing?” 
   “ Mr. Braylon,” he spoke respectfully 
“This is my family’s secret. A heritage as old as horse buggies and black powder guns. We are vampire hunters! Alas, amidst this natural disaster, the foul beasts have already begun taking advantage of our unfortunate situation.” 
Mr. Braylon scoffed quietly. He was pretending to be skeptical, but Agatha’s disfigured corpse had clearly convinced him of the supernatural. My mother bent down and gently brushed a hand across Agatha’s neck. 
“ believe me or not, this body is far from their normal levels of mutilation. The beast was quick, cautious. This is not a full frontal attack, they’re still testing the waters.” 
 My brother swept his moppy hair off his eyes,  
“Do you think miss Agatha needs some holy water, Admiral mom!?” He piped with a salute 
“I mean… Admiral Helsing, sir!” 
My brother had spent his whole life trying to be someone he couldn’t be, and consequently failed at becoming someone he could. 
“No, private. But prepare your sling with holy water, it may be needed soon” 
My father puffed up his chest and waved his hands as he began to speak to the crowd,
“We must gather all our neighbors and brethren and warn them of the coming tide. We shall set defenses in the library and make it our fortress. There we will continue with plans of action! “ 
Then from the west came shouting. Then from the east came screaming. Then from the north and from the south, a chorus of terror exploded and filled the towns air. The sound of agony stuck in the throat like the ash that fell. I could tell that many of the voices were replaced over time with new ones. I hoped they were sounds one makes when they flee, not when cut down. 

The chorus of screams dwindled until the last voice went silent. The small group we encountered just stood motionless, paralyzed with fear. They didn’t even dare to make a sound. Nathan, who was once sniffling and whimpering, stood wide eyed and quiet as snot dripped over his lips. My father saw the state of us. He saw my brother softly trembling. a slow quiet clink of bottles was heard as he shook. Sure he wasn’t a great vampire hunter, but my father was a great man. He spoke gently, just above a whisper,
“ please, we need to make our way to the library. I know you are all afraid, and I am too. But I promise to each and every one of you———

  he looked onwards at the small group. 

Nathan, the bank teller. Serving this town for 15 years, always gave an honest loan.

Mr.Braylon, owner of “Joe’s General Goods”. The towns solitude convenience store, passed down from his father and his father before him. 

Nancy Braylon, wife of Mr.Braylon and hairstylist at the “Snowy Cap Clips” . She’ll get you looking “spiffy in a jiffy!”

Laurie Spengler, undefeated Catan champion, and the kindest woman you’ll ever meet. 

Richard Spengler, a hilarious guy and a wonderful teacher. 

Daniel Gutierrez. Loving husband, father, and grandfather. 

   May they rest in peace 


——— I will protect you with my life” 


Post 4: 


I have a confession to make. I lied on my last post. I wanted to make myself look badass, like some great monster slayer. But that’s not what this story is about, is it? My family are vampire hunters, but they are all bad at their job. Why would I be the exception? That night I really was pulled away from typing. And I was pinned to the ground. But I cried as it bore its wild fangs. The old man, Henry Herlander, who walked with a cane and could barely bathe himself. But was once a champion boxer in his prime. He wore sterling silver rings on each finger and beat that vampire to a bloody damn pulp. And he died saving me.

 I wanted to pretend that I was posting this online for everyone to see, because I was documenting our heroic deeds. Telling the tale of the underdogs who overcame adversity and saved the day. But that’s not the case at all. The reason I'm writing this, is because I want people to know what happened here today. All the lives that were terrorized. All the people who fought courageously to the very end. And how I cowered. 


We continued on, huddled together like water balloons in a bucket. We were moving at a crawling pace, each step felt like a milestone. I wasn't sure that the group believed us. And I wasn't sure if they trusted us either. But they followed us anyway. Maybe it was some primal survival instinct we had, like a herd of zebras evading stalking lions. 

I assumed the lava began to cool off, because it soon got much, much darker. There was barely any light at all. I looked to my wrist watch and pressed the illuminate button.  

10:00am
 
I wasn't sure if I was just paranoid, but I often saw eyes glistening red in the voids of light. Glistens in the alleyways,  in the middle of the street, on the rooftops, along the edges of ash heaps. Sometimes I saw so many red spots peering from the darkness, it was as if we were stalked by large spiders. But what frightened me the most was that I could FEEL them watching.  

We continued to the library because that is where my uncle, my mother’s brother, worked full time. He was a veteran honored with many medals. But the war had taken his legs and he fell into a deep state of depression. There in the library he found a passion for books. Over time he rediscovered lost hobbies that he had abandoned. Hobbies, like gun-smithing. To my mother’s request, my uncle had been discreetly smelting silver bullets, and assembling them into high-caliber rounds. The library was the designated rendezvous during a vampiric emergency because my uncle was simply a very immobile man, and would most likely already be at the library during a catastrophe. However, the group did not know this and questioned,

 “why we would travel such a distance to the library, instead of bunkering down in a home? “  whispered Daniel. 

The Spenglers nodded in agreement. My father solemnly waved a hand to dismiss them. He could not tell them, because he knew the monsters were always listening. The group accepted his dismissal with slight grimaces, but continued to look ahead.  I caught them often fixating longingly at the buildings we passed. 

When the volcano erupted I saw many people exit their buildings to witness the spectacle. And then later we all heard the screams. But there was not a single corpse seen in these streets. I hoped that the townspeople were simply hiding in their homes, as quiet as mice. Maybe huddled together in their closets or their bathrooms, with a gun pointed vigilantly at the door. But then came the thought my mother had clearly realized earlier. In their gluttony the monsters had consumed their victims whole. 

I awakened from my trance when I had bumped into Ms. Braylon. The group had stopped, and before us were the tall cathedral doors of the library. I rubbed my hand across the soot covered walls. Some sort of masonry, and it felt particularly hearty. 


Post 5: 


The library was a large cathedral, ancient and built like a castle. For centuries townsfolk had made this their place of worship. But over time the congregation consisted of merely one family, who felt far too selfish using the cavernous space for just themselves. So pews became towering shelves, and the alter became a reception desk. 

I looked up at the long column of hinges that rose towards the sky. Hand-forged by blacksmiths long dead. I wondered if I would leave anything for future civilizations to remember me. 

Ash had breached their high tolerances and clogged them like Bigfoot’s shower drain. We took turns pulling with all our might. We tugged and tugged, each pull sounding a grinding screech from the hinges. The doors opened only just enough for us to be able to squeeze through one by one. 

But all parties hesitated. Because beyond the doorway was a complete absence of light. It was not like an infinite void of darkness, this was depthless, like an opaque portal that gave no hint of the other side. 

We knew the street lights were on a timer, so it was not odd that they were off. But the library opens at 8:00am. Why were the lights off now? 

Richard spoke up 

“Mr. Turner is probably just sick for the day. Didn’t get a chance to— 

Mr. Braylon interrupted him.
“Then why is the door unlocked?” 
He said it plainly. Cold, but with no ill intent. 

“U-u-uncle…Flynn….”
My brother mumbled quietly to himself, 

“This is most likely an improvisation on his part. My brother is not a man deserving of worry. “ 

She turned to face my father.
“ Leroy, my dear husband, will you please take lead? “

He nodded gently at her. 

“Theodore. John. Melissa. Please join me in an embrace. Let it be our motivation and lest our last.”
 We all hugged each other tightly with tears in our eyes. My father was an overly-dramatic man, but I would let him have his moment. 

He embarked onward, silver pauldrons scraping against the shallow opening. After a few clanking thuds from his footsteps descended in volume, his voice cried out in an echo. 
“There is a room lit by candlelight in the far left corner! Follow the center aisle until you see the light!” 

We all looked at each other as if saying, “I’m not going in there” 

“It will be okay. Just stay close to each other, they won’t attack us while we’re in a group. “ My mother said. 

“And what about the rest of the town!?” 
Daniel nearly shouted,
“ how is it that we were the only ones to form a group??” 

Nancy Braylon agreed, 
“ The Smith’s is a family of eight. Do you think they are doing fine?” 

“Yeah but six of that family are just kids” cut Mr. Braylon.
Mr. Spengler shuddered. 

“Maybe they’re all held up in their homes like we should’ve done” said Laurie. 

Even Nathan spoke up,
“ The only strange thing I’ve seen is you and your family dressed up like fools!” 
Shy nods of approval came from the crowd. 

The discourse was cut by a loud rumble and shake of the earth. The red glow on the horizon grew brighter. I turned around and saw over 50 silhouettes, in several rows, forming a crescent shape around us. It wasn’t just their eyes glistening now, blood soaked mouths and wild toothy fangs. They crouched low, all eyes pointing on us. 

And they were only 15 feet away.

1ox86mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ox86mi/which_machine_should_i_choose_with_specific/,Which machine should I choose (with specific requirements)?,"My birthday is next week, and I'm looking to treat myself to a nice coffee machine. We currently use a Nespresso, and I'm just tired of sourcing the pods, the prices of the pods, and the waste overall. I generally also don't love the quality of the espresso from most pods, and steaming the milk is annoying. 

I would not call myself a connoisseur whatsoever, but I do enjoy good coffee (hence why I'm looking superauto -- I'm not going to put in the work to grind, tamp, tweak, etc, but I still want it to be delicious). My drink of choice is a latte, though I also like an americano and filter coffee from time to time and want to expand into new drinks. I'm not picky with milk foam and honestly probably wouldn't notice the temperature of the milk.  

Here are some requirements that are making my selection difficult:

\- My wife is big on design and wants one in WHITE to match our kitchen

\- She also generally drinks iced lattes, and given she's already rolling her eyes at spending on a new machine, I'd like one that she can enjoy as well with the cold drink options. This is probably not a deal breaker though as she already just brews a shot early, puts it in the fridge, and comes back later. She wouldn't even know there are options out there with cold drinks. 

\- We primarily drink decaf, but that's not exactly a popular choice when we have guests. I'd like to be able to easily swap beans when needed.

\- It needs to be relatively easy to clean. 

\- We have small kids, and I wake up much earlier than them, so I'd like it to be quiet.  

My wife works at a big retailer that carries many brands, and she get's 40% off anything they sell. They carry the Jura Z10, bringing the price to $2500 brand new. Price isn't a blocker, but I just wonder if I'll get the value out of the price tag since I'm not going to be analyzing every note of caramel and chocolate, or checking the texture of the milk foam. I've also seen that it's not the easiest to clean, and the beans aren't easy to swap. The Jura J8 Twin feels like a more affordable (relative term) alternative but doesn't do cold drinks. 

What would you recommend based on the above requirements?",1,1763153488.0,superautomatic,5,1.0,False
1ox85yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1ox85yn/what_smart_plugs_work_well_for_energy_monitoring/,What smart plugs work well for energy monitoring?,"Look, I've been using smart plugs for about two years now, and I can tell you straight up - not all of them are created equal, especially when it comes to energy monitoring.

So here's the deal. I used to leave stuff plugged in all the time without thinking about it. My electric bill was crazy high, and I had no clue what was causing it. That's when I started looking into smart plugs with energy monitoring features.

The best ones I've found actually show you real-time power consumption right in the app. You can see exactly how many watts your coffee maker uses, or how much that old mini fridge in your garage is costing you every month. It's honestly kind of eye-opening when you realize your gaming console is sucking power even when it's ""off.""

What makes a good energy monitoring smart plug? First off, the app needs to be simple and actually work. I've tried some cheap ones where the app was total garbage - constantly disconnecting or showing wrong data. Second, you want accurate readings. Some plugs give you rough estimates, but the good ones track everything down to the kilowatt-hour.

The plugs that work best usually connect through WiFi and don't need a separate hub. They should track daily, weekly, and monthly usage so you can spot patterns. Some even send you alerts when something's using too much power.

If you're serious about cutting down your electricity costs, I'd recommend checking out [these smart plugs with energy monitoring](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs). They've got solid reviews and the tracking features actually help you save money.

Here's my practical advice - start with one or two plugs on your biggest energy hogs. For me, that was an old space heater and my entertainment center. After a month of monitoring, I realized the heater was costing me like $40 extra per month. Switched to a newer model and boom, problem solved.

The scheduling feature is clutch too. You can set things to automatically turn off when you don't need them. My phone charger now shuts off at night, and my living room lamps turn off at 11 PM even if I forget.

You don't need to go crazy and put them on every outlet in your house. Just focus on appliances that run a lot or things you suspect might be wasting energy. Window AC units, space heaters, older TVs, and kitchen appliances are usually the biggest culprits.

If you want to get started, [grab a couple smart plugs here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) and test them out on different devices. Track the data for a few weeks, then decide where you can make changes.

Bottom line - smart plugs with energy monitoring are worth it if you actually use the data. They pay for themselves pretty quick when you catch those energy vampires draining your wallet every month.",1,1763153442.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

The Garden of Bleeding Roses. This is a place of love, a place of hate. This is a place of heaven, a place of hell. This is a place of healing, a place of bloodshed. It’s a place of whatever you want it to be, whatever you *need* it to be. A place where you can find the meaning of life, as long as you can find the meaning of your death. It’s a place that knows your desires and trauma and uses it against you. There are three rules you must follow.

1. You cannot come without a Roman flatbread and wine, as it represents flesh and blood.
2. You must not call or pray to your gods, no matter what happens, as they cannot hear you.
3. You must bring a bunch of grapes as your only meal, as once you enter, you are considered royalty.

Follow these rules and you will come out alive and if you disobey, what comes out will not be what you used to be. 



His hand shook over the mouse. Looking at the screen, he read over and over. He knew the Garden of Bleeding Roses wasn't a real place… but what if it was? His nostrils were filled with the smell of copper. He smelled the blood of the roses. He read it again and felt less intrigued. In the place of the curiosity he felt before was this sinking dread. There was a new sentence that he hadn't noticed before… no, it hadn't been there before.

“This is a place of life, a place of death.”

Jack was sure that hadn't been there before, it stuck out like a thorn on a rose. It had been added when he wasn't looking, which was impossible because he was looking at an image. 

He left the room. He was too confused and scared by what just happened. As he went downstairs, he felt his cat brush up on his leg. He knelt down and started petting his cat, his fur feeling of cotton and cloth.

“Hey Nugget, you want some food?”

Nugget purred and pawed at him.

“K, let's go get you some food.”

As he walked down the stairs, holding Nugget, he couldn't stop thinking about that last line.

“This is a place of life, a place of death.”



He fed his cat and turned on the TV but when he turned it on, all that was showing was static. Prickly, sharp static. He tried changing the station, but nothing worked. 

He saw his cat looking at the TV, back arched. He tried calming down his cat by petting him, but the second he touched him, his blood ran cold as a flower petal on a harsh winter night. He felt something prick his skin. He looked at his finger and a trail of crimson ran down. Looking back at his cat, he saw something that made bile climb up his throat. A rose bush was making its way around his cat. He went to stand up and grab his cat, but couldn't move his legs. He looked down and saw a rose bush rapidly climbing up his legs. He looked back at the TV and it was no longer showing static. What he saw made him throw up. It was that image. 

That God forsaken, evil image of The Garden of Bleeding Roses. He got snapped out of looking at the image by a crunching sound followed by a cat screeching. He looked over and saw the rose bushes had completely consumed his cat. The screeching continued and he couldn't stand it. He went through his pockets to find anything that could cut the rose bush off his cat. Finally, he grabbed a pocket knife. He leaned as close as he could and cut the rose bush. 

The pricks of the thorns were agony, but his cat was in hell and he couldn't stand it. Eventually, he got the cat unstuck. Nugget ran out the cat door. He thought he could get himself out too, but a bush grabbed his arm and pulled him down. He felt his bones cracking and knew it was too late. The Garden of Bleeding Roses had consumed him.



# Chapter 1: Nugget

Cameron looked at the cat, heartbroken. Someone had found a cat with broken bones and brought it to the animal shelter where Cameron worked. What sick monster would break their cat’s bones. Cameron checked the collar of the cat.

“Nugget, you poor thing. I'm so sorry you were abused like that. You're safe here though, don't worry little guy.”

Nugget laid there, being prepped for an amputation. His back left leg was crushed so badly that his leg flopped around like a dying flower. 

“Listen Nugget, once you leave surgery, you will not have a leg anymore. I love you little guy.”

Nugget meowed at Cameron, as if he understood what he was saying.

He stroked Nugget’s head, careful not to touch the mangled leg. 

“You’re going to be okay… we’ll get through this together. I'm sorry your owner hurt you. I'm going to take you home Nugget-”

Nugget hissed at Cameron, not out of anger but seeming to be of sadness. No, not sadness but… loneliness.



The amputation of Nuggets leg was successful. Cameron entered the room to bring Nugget home. Entering the surgery room, he couldn’t help but notice the sterile smell of it all. This clean, almost bleachy smell made him almost break down in tears. His previous cat, Peter, had died in his arms in this exact same room. The exact same smell was in the room. Despite Cameron being glad Nugget was alive, he couldn’t help but ask why it couldn’t have been Peter too. Why couldn’t Nugget *and* Peter be alive? Why couldn’t he have two loveable cats living life with him? He remembered Peter’s chest rising once, then never again. He remembered hearing Peter's heart beat in sync with his before slowly becoming slower and slower until… it wasn't there with Camerons anymore. Cameron had let Peter outside a few days before he would die. Peter ran into Cameron’s rose bushes. Something must’ve bitten Peter, because he was bleeding when he came in and over the next few days, he became frail and weak before he would die in Cameron’s arms. 



“Cameron, are you here to pick up Nugget?”

Cameron was snapped out of his thoughts and looked at Jane.

“Oh, hey Jane. Yeah, I’m here to grab Nugget, and I'm gonna take him home.”

“Okay, sounds good. Oh, also on your way home could you bring this to Jeff?”

Jane grabbed a box with rats in it. Jane continued what she was saying.

“Just some dead rats for his snake.”

“Oh yeah, of course. I’ll eat dinner at his place while I’m at it.”



Cameron's car didn't have Bluetooth. This didn't bother Cameron though, due to the fact he had a very specific hobby. He collected CD's. Rock, rap, pop, doesn't matter. He has a CD of whatever he wants. Today he was feeling in the mood for rap, so he grabbed the first rap cd in his bag, that being Cherry Bomb by Tyler, The Creator. The CD felt rough and used. He could feel every crack and imperfection on the case. It bugged Cameron. He put the CD back and grabbed his most recent CD he purchased, some experimental horror ambient album. He looked at the name. It was called “Compositions Arranged in The Garden of Bleeding Roses.” It sounded pretentious, like something someone who actually watches movies like Hereditary or Midsommar would listen to.

He looked at the tracklist. The names were as fancy and pretentious as the name of the album.

1. Blood on The Roses (8:41)
2. Crimson Petals (9:57)
3. Gore Tulips (2:53)
4. The Light Has Diminished (15:25)
5. A Place of Life, A Place Of Death (11:11)
6. Deadly Improvisations \[Bonus Track\] (5:23)

This is fifty-three minutes and thirty seconds. It's definitely some avant garde pretentious album. Cameron was snapped out of his annoyance when he heard Nugget meow.

“Oh, hey little guy.”

Nugget meowed again.

“Sorry for sitting here so long, let me just pop in this CD and I'll get going.”

Nugget laid down after Cameron said that. He grabbed the CD, which was a dark red on the front but somehow shinier than usual on the back, and popped it in. The second the music started though, Nugget started hissing. Nuggets back was arched and he started screeching and trying to attack the CD case. Cameron immediately popped out the CD, put it back in its case, although, when he put the CD back in the case it felt… sticky. He grabbed Call Me If You Get Lost, perfect. He popped it in, comforted Nugget, and drove away.



As the song JUGGERNAUT started playing, he pulled into Jeff's driveway. Jeff was already outside, smoking. When he saw Cameron pull up, he got out of his chair and ran up to the car and banged on the window.

“Ay Cameron, get out here man! The new Carti album dropped!”

Cameron slowly grabbed Nugget and rolled his eyes. Jeff always cared about Playboi Carti too much.

Cameron walked up to Jeff and said, “I know Jeff. I listened to it and it was mid. Had three government mandated Travis Scott features that weren't even that good and even though Kendrick was on it, it didn't improve it in any way. Making us wait five years for the most subpar Carti album yet.”

Jeff looked at Cameron like he just saw a murder.

“Nah man, you trippin’ homie. That was a generational album. Carti killed it.”

“Whatever you say Jeff the Killer.”

“Man, shut up. I had that creepypasta phase when I was 14, get over it.”

Cameron laughed. Cameron and Jane came up with the nickname Jeff the Killer back in middle school because of Jeff's obsession with creepypasta.

“Anyways, I got the rats for your snake. They stunk up the car on the way here, so you're giving me some air freshener.

Jeff looked at Cameron pissed. Jeff handed Cameron an air freshener. 

“It's getting late Cameron, you should get home.”

Cameron thought for a moment and asked “Could I crash at your place tonight? My place is an hour away and I am starved.”

Jeff looked at Cameron, half excited, half annoyed.

“Fine, come inside. My girlfriend's making dinner tonight, so you know we're about to eat good.”

Jeff's girlfriend, Mia, was an amazing cook. He was excited. 

He walked into the house and Mia looked over and smiled.

“Cameron! Nice to see you. Are you just staying for dinner or are you staying overnight?”

“I'm staying overnight, if you don't mind at least.”

“Why would I mind? You're always welcome here- oh hello little guy! Who's the precious kitty in the cage?”

Nugget meowed at Mia.

“Oh, that's Nugget. I'm taking him in, he just got his leg amputated unfortunately.”

Mia looked shocked when Cameron said the last part.

“Oh no, what happened to his leg?”

Cameron took a deep breath and replied “Someone found him limping on the side of the road. When they brought him in, it turned out his bones were broken. We assume that he was abused by his previous owner, we got police checking the house on his old collar tomorrow.”

Mia looked at Nugget, teary eyed.

“You poor creature. How could anyone hurt an innocent animal like you? Don't worry, you're safe here.”

Cameron let Nugget out of the cage and Nugget limped over to Mia and brushed up against her. Mia sat down and pet Nugget slowly and carefully.



Mia made a creamy butternut squash soup, with basil and rosemary. She had made some fish for Nugget, due to the fact they only had dog food. Nugget had warmed up to everyone quickly. Looking over, he saw that Jeff and Mia's dog was finally coming out. He was an old dog, twelve years old. Cameron took the final sip of his soup before walking over to the sink, about to wash his bowl.

“Cameron, what are you doing? Just put it in the dishwasher.” Mia said, confused.

“Oh crap, sorry. Force of habit.” Cameron replied, embarrassed.

Once Cameron put his bowl in the dishwasher, he went over to Marshall, their dog, and started petting him. Marshall's fur was dry and scratchy, it had been a while since it was soft. Cameron remembered when Jeff got Marshall, he was graduating high school and his parents got it for him as a gift. Cameron looked at Marshall. He knew that within the next six months, he would be in the vet office with Jane, Jeff, and Mia. Marshall was an old dog and would pass away very soon.

“Cameron, you’ve been petting Marshall and staring into space for almost ten minutes, you okay dude?” Jeff asked, pulling Cameron out of his daze. 

“Oh, yeah. I’m okay, just… tired. I think I’m gonna go to bed, goodnight dude.”

Jeff responded, but Cameron walked to the guest room with Nugget.



Cameron was driving to the animal shelter. When he woke up, Nugget was already in the living room with Jeff and Mia, being fed more fish. Cameron had eaten, had a coffee, quickly said goodbye and left all in 45 minutes. Nugget was sleeping in his cage and Cameron was listening to The Eminem Show. As he arrived at work, he saw police standing outside with Jane with them, looking worried. He pulled in and grabbed Nugget. Cameron walked up to the officers, tense. One of the officers started to speak. 

“Hello. You’re Cameron, the one who’s taking in Nugget, right?’

“Yeah, why? Is something wrong?”

“Well, we checked the house that the back of Nuggets collar listed and inside… someone was dead inside. Bones crushed, like Nuggets. We assume it’s a homicide case, but we will need to check more into the case. The person we found dead was Jack Farston.”

Cameron looked down at Nugget, who seemed to almost be… crying.



Cameron was tired. It was only 12:27 in the afternoon, but Cameron needed a drink. He reached into his bag and grabbed a preworkout, some iced tea flavor. He opened the pouch and poured it into his water bottle. He smelled the pouch and started coughing, this crap could be used as a damn alternative for smelling salts. He threw the pouch away and shook his bottle and chugged the iced tea. It took about five minutes, but suddenly, Cameron was energized.



As the caffeine started to wear off, he checked the time. It was 3:07 in the afternoon, he would be off work in about an hour.

I'm so amazed how this stuff really works??? the essay sounds more mature and detailed. It explains ideas more clearly and uses more specific words, so it feels more organized. It makes me think the humanized one should be flagged, right?

Teachers usually like our essays to look like you put more effort into it. The humanized sentences are longer, the voicabulary is stronger, and the explanations are deeper. It feels like it's really trying to inform readers instead of just giving basic ideas. It also shows stronger reasoning, it makes the writing look more ai generated imo, but no, it has a lower score from gptzero. 

Im so confused yet I know that I have to be more competetive to become better, I mean there's easier way, simply use a undetectable ai humanizer or use it as a reference to learn and avoid sounding too robotic to bypass ai detectors lol.

Anyone here have the same experience? what is your opinion on someone like me leaning on learning AI to get a small push like how coffee does to start our day but in a sense of writing, would you recommend it?

1ox7zdb,https://v.redd.it/ga83nfj1ba1g1,Enchantment (and some of Mii Amo) Sedona Review,"So here’s part 2 of our Sedona adventure! After Ambiente (reviewed yesterday), I was sure we’d experienced the best of Sedona but I was excited to go and recreate Enchantment’s famous red rock view from the pool.
 
**Location/Room**: Wow. The location right in nature is the attraction here, and this is 95% of what you are paying for. I’d seen photos, but to be that surrounded by the red rocks, to see them towering over every perspective, to walk by and touch them, and walk from your room into a hike—well, that’s something that took my breath away. The resort is pretty massive and it was fully booked when we were there so there was lots of hustle and bustle, and we explored both Enchantment and Mii amo (which is feels like a part of Enchantment even if it has a different sign). The views from the pools (Enchantment and Mii Amo) are just gorgeous and each one has a hot tub. There are vegetable gardens, coffee markets, park areas with benches, desert zen gardens, tennis courts (or possibly pickleball), etc. The landscaping feels lush.
 
The room was a bit meh to be honest. It was clean and comfortable and the pillows were nice, but not anything extremely memorable. Honestly, we had a group in the room next to us one night and could actually hear their conversation, so the walls are a bit thin. Our neighbors were quiet the rest of the time so it didn’t really bother me too much. They did have standards like slippers and robes, and housekeeping was excellent. Our terrace view was really nice (could see the red rocks), but it also overlooked the parking lot, but we had activities or were exploring most of the time anyway.
 
**Service**: This is pretty great, but due to the size and occupancy of the resort, it’s not really possible to get truly personalized attention (not as much as at Ambiente anyway). They did have an attendant bring us a bottle of champagne, which my boyfriend always loves (but this was more due to @alex_travels being awesome than the hotel, per se), and the attendant was absolutely lovely. We also received nonalcoholic welcome drinks when we pulled up and the check in location is really cute (cobblestone-y vibes with a beautiful outdoor archway wrapped in ivy).
 
I will say that I do love a text-based concierge, which Ambiente has and Enchantment doesn’t, but Enchantment also answers their emails and Ambiente doesn’t, so it’s a bit of a wash there.
 
**Food**: They have a coffee shop in the market (that actually makes a really good pumpkin spice latte with real cinnamon sticks—I identify as basic, don’t come for me), and 2 restaurants with insane views and floor to ceiling windows (Che Ah Chi and Tii Gavo). Mii Amo also has a restaurant called Hummingbird. You can walk in for lunch but they require reservations for dinner (asked 2 days ahead for Hummingbird reservations and the earliest we could get was 8:15, so book early if you’re staying here). We went to Che Ah Chi at 5:30 the first night we were there so it wasn’t too crowded and the service was great, but we went to Tii Gavo the next night at 7:30 and they were really understaffed (ie., no one refilled my water the entire time after taking a bite of a spicy appetizer so I had to steal my boyfriend’s water). I heard a guest trying to get a reservation and making a complaint that the general public could get in, and they were annoyed that they couldn’t. We had dinner at Hummingbird our final night there, and that was my favorite of the 3 even if the views of the other two are breathtaking. The smoothie bar outside of Hummingbird is also really awesome and unique.
 
**Activities**: This is very resort-y where you have the daily activities displayed in the main building in the lobby every day. They also have an adorable “Enchantment newspaper” with tons of activities printed and ready for you in your room. We did the stargazing, which was so awesome! I definitely recommend it. Just FYI—many resorts offer a private stargazing experience with the same NASA astronomer (I believe the cheapest is $300pp), but he does a free group event on Saturdays and Tuesdays at Enchantment. While it’s also great getting the extra cost savings, we mainly liked being able to come and go as we pleased, and we ended up staying about 45 minutes of the 2 hour event. If you do this, you can also ask him if you can do some astrophotography (apparently he does not always do this at the free events) and he helps you set up your phone in front of the telescope to capture a picture of what you have seen (see mine with the moon). We also did a hike to Devil’s Bridge on our own, but you can do plenty of guided hikes, and almost any activity you can think of; I think it would also be great for families.
 
**Spa**: I am a spa person, and (shockingly lol) I absolutely loved Mii Amo. There’s massive doors to enter, zen gardens, outdoor pool and hot tub, indoor hot tubs, beige markets full of cloud-like clothes, zen salt room with a giant crystal, a spa waiting area with chocolate raspberries and chili pistachios, and all kinds of good stuff. The relaxation area looks like Barbie discovered cloud couches and includes a view of the red rocks (it’s inside but adjacent to the Mii Amo outdoor pool). When we booked our massages, we got an email saying that we could use the facilities (pools, etc) the day of the service, but when I went to check in, they said we can only use them for 1 hour before the service, so we were welcome to explore the zen garden, but not the pools, until we were within that time frame. So we enjoyed an American Girl sized smoothie and wandered around for an hour, and then checked in. I was a bit bummed that the indoor hot tubs were separated by gender but the one outside ended up being great too.
 
Someone had mentioned in a review a while back that something smelled like chlorine during their massage, and a few other people mentioned ambient noise, but that wasn’t our experience. The massages were excellent, and we had no issues at all.
 
**Overall impression**: I definitely see why Enchantment is often reviewed as the reigning place to stay in Sedona. While the room aesthetic isn’t as impressive as Ambiente, the scenery and the experience certainly are. Overall, I’m glad we went to both Ambiente and Enchantment, but I think spending the majority of our time at Enchantment was the way to go. It was really inspiring to experience what unique designs humans can build, but after all, it’s natural wonder that made Sedona famous.",3,1763152997.0,chubbytravel,15,0.67,False

I’ve been exploring the idea of opening a little coffee shop someday, but everyone I know has *wildly* different needs:

* My nurse friend says **no drive-thru = instant dealbreaker**.
* My grad-school friend won’t even LOOK at a place unless it has a comfy patio and a power outlet.
* Another friend picks based on whether his dog “approves” the seating.
* And one dude swears he’ll melt and die if he sits outside in June.

1ox7xks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ox7xks/a_water_recipe_for_switzerland/,A water recipe for Switzerland,"Switzerland has excellent tap water. However, it is quite hard in many places and certainly not ideal for coffee. The same goes for bottled water from Swiss sources: they are often high in minerals. Furthermore, I found it almost impossible to get food safe distilled water at a reasonable price. The mineral-free water sold in supermarkets is ""distilled equivalent"", meaning that ions have been changed but the water has not been purifiend and has not been handled with food safety in mind.

Enter Lidl. Lidl in Switzerland (and Germany, perhaps also other European countries) is selling an extremely soft bottled water as ""Saskia"", which you can use almost as distilled water and as a starting point for your water recipe. Be aware that the water comes from very different sources. The only good source is Saskia from Kirkel source. Currently, the 1.5l bottles in Switzerland contain water from this source. The 0.5l Saskia bottles have water from a very different source that is much harder. Saskia Kirkel has a total hardness of .66 °dH=11.7ppm and alkalinity of .66 °dH

I then used this [post from Barista Hustle](https://www.baristahustle.com/diy-water-recipes-redux/) to make two solutions from Saskia water:

* the hardness source with MgSO4 (Epsom salt), 2.45g per litre
   * available at a drug store (Drogerie) or pharmacy; if you ask at the counter they should be able to fill a sachet for you. I paid CHF 4 for 100g
* the buffer with NaHCO3 (Soda), 1.68g per litre
   * you can get it at Coop or Migros in the bakery aisle. I paid CHF 1.50 for 50g.
   * do not confuse with Backpulver/lévure chimique/lievito chimico which has NaHCO3 mixed with an acid

Then use the [water calculator](https://www.baristahustle.com/app-archive-main/the-water-calculator/)'s ""remineraliser"" tool to calculate how much alkalinity, buffer and untreated Saskia water you have to mix to get your desired water recipe. For 1 litre of the BH recipe the formula with Saskia is 80g of hardness with 40g buffer and 880g of Saskia.

I don't have a .01g scale and am not extremely precise in mixing the solutions (±5 ml). It works, however. The aquarium titration tests for total hardness and carbonate hardness indicate that my final water is within the desired range.

In some places you can use your tap water to create your water, but you need to know your water's total hardness and alkalinity. In my house the landlord installed a salt based ion changer for the whole house. It reduces hardness (by changing Calcium for Sodium) but leaves alkalinity untouched. Unfortunately, this water is very difficult to mix with mineral-less water like Saskia.

In my case mineralising bottled water is the most practical solution. I'm suspicious of water filters because of bacteria and other issues. 1.5l of Saskia is 0.30 CHF, so very affordable, food grade and cheaper than any distilled water.

I'm leaving this here for others, since I found it difficult how to get to a working solution and little practical information.

I asked a girl out to drink some coffee and have a walk around the university campus after final exams, somehow the topic of religion came into place, because we were talking about philosophy and I mentioned her about my process of being raised protestant, but practically being agnostic my entire life, a crisis of identity, and my return to the Faith chossing Catholicism as the only way valid, according to reason, about the need for Objective and Universal Truth in a world filled with the wickedness of relativism and the utter chaos and confusion that liberalism has brought to, I talked to her about St Pius X, Fulton Sheen, Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Ratzinger, it was a very intimate and enjoyable moment, as I don't tend to have this enriching conversations so often, I replied to each of her objections with humility and charity, she was surprisingly very interested in talking more about it. I wanted this not to be a regular date, but to give meaning and purpose to each word. 

But she had to go, I accompanied her to the bus station, and then we said goodbye, when I was returning to university, I took another street and ended up in a parish, there was no Mass, but I was tired of walking and the weather was hot, I prayed the rosary in a chapel and then for some reason I didn't toom the street I take to return to my university but took another path, I saw a bus, and somehow had the impulse to run to enter the bus and go to Mass, I went to Mass, somehow the priest's sermon was related to the topics I talked to her, about humans admiring the creature but refusing to recognize the Createor. 

After Mass I told the priest about the history, about my emptiness of somehow having such engaging experience sharing the Faith and doing the Lord's work of telling the Gospel, but at the same time empty because I didn't really new God besides books, I could talk hours and hours but I've never met him, and I've been very inconsistent with my prayer life and have fallen into sin over and over. 

He told me to ask for intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, after Mass I ate at a nearby restaurant, and then returned to the campus to wait for the evening test. 

This is without a doubt a very interesting day, one to be remembered, a reminder of strengthening my Faith. 

Although I'm attracted to her as we have a lot in common, somehow I feel glad that I'm learning by little to love like Christ did, to be mlre humble and to be more charitable. 

Somehow I feel as if God is calling me, in this utter silence, for some reason I cannot explain some kind of peace, some kind of silence and fulfilment that I had not experienced long ago.

1ox7pkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brightonco/comments/1ox7pkn/coffee_places/,Coffee places,"Just a couple years ago, Brighton was a one-coffee house town with only Starbucks.  We have really stepped up our game in the last couple years with several new coffee places to choose from.

Here's my list along with my personal rating and notes.  I'm a big coffee fan and purest who typically orders just plain cold brew.  Feedback welcome, especially those I haven't tried!

  
**Willow & Fern** \- 8/10 - Great coffee (Huckleberry Roaster's beans) made right, nice freshly made pastries, Bonfire burritos, and other savory items.  Very nice dog-friendly patio out back.

**Wolf and Honey** \- 4/10 - Coffee and cocktails.  Also serves pastry items (frozen from La Belle rather than fresh baked), and lunch sandwiches.  Only had the coffee.  Worst cold brew I've had on a while.  Tasted strongly metallic and almost chemical tasting, overpriced, and sadly undrinkable. 

**7AM Somewhere**  \- n/a - Not yet visited, but on the list.

**Pine Grove Coffee Bar** \- n/a - Not yet visited.  Kind of inside a girly looking store of some sort, and pics of drinks all look girly too.  I just like good coffee, probably won't try this one.

**Ziggi's** \- 6/10 - Best of the chains and nice snacks.

**Dutch Bros** \- 5.5/10 - Not too bad and two convenient Brighton locations.

**Starbucks** \- 5/10 - The McDonalds of coffee.  Not great but predictable and consistent.

**History**

31F (turned 31 the day before the marathon). No formal running or track background, unless you count six weeks of indoor track my freshman year of high school, but I grew up playing a lot of sports. This was my 7^(th) marathon and my second with a coach.

I’ve always been too shy to post a race report because I know how knowledgeable and fast this sub is, but I constantly search for detailed reports from women, so I figured I should contribute one and take up some space :)

Marathon history below. Until this year I never maintained more than about 15 to 20 miles a week outside of 16 to 18 week training blocks. I didn’t have a real base until this year between London and Indy, though I usually ran two to three times a week socially and stayed active.

2017 NYM 3:35 (20–40 mpw, all easy)

2018 NYM 3:27 (30–40 mpw, all easy)

2022 NYM 3:21 (30–50 mpw, started running with a group, bought a watch, extremely hot and humid year)

2023 Chicago 3:08 (35–50 mpw, surprising PR while recovering from surgery and a blood transfusion)

2024 Boston 3:12 (40–60 mpw, added speedwork, warm year again, really wanted sub 3)

2025 London 2:57 (50–65 mpw, hit 70 once, took most of the year off after Boston and did mostly Pilates, hired a coach in December, ran easy runs truly easy, learned to fuel, had so much fun with training, another warm race)

2025 Indy 2:48 (50–70 mpw)

**Training**

I’ve spent the last ten months working with an incredible coach. I literally attribute all my progress to him. I basically didn’t run more than about 15 to 20 miles a week from April to November 2024, so I really started back from scratch with him. My training is usually five days of running, one day of very easy bike recovery (my heart rate stays below 130), and one day completely off. If I’m restless I’ll add some core, Pilates, or yoga on my off day.

I don’t strength train right now, even though I’ve spent many years lifting and doing HIIT. I have a demanding job that has me traveling every week, so it’s hard to fit in much besides my runs and that one bike day. I never doubled. My coach did lactate testing with me over the summer, which was really interesting and genuinely helpful.

My usual structure is recovery 1hr bike on Monday. Easy run around ten miles on Tuesday, sometimes with strides or short hill sprints. Speedwork on Wednesday. Another easy ten miles on Thursday. Off day on Friday. Saturday is a long run with pace work or speed work, usually 16 to 21 miles. Sunday is a longish run of 12 to 16 miles. Almost all my easy runs are true Z1, not Z2.

My speedwork tends to be more on the fast, short side with lots of 1, 2, and 3 minute intervals. Long run pace work often includes short sprints before or after getting into pace miles, usually a touch faster than marathon pace. For example, two minutes fast straight into two miles at around 6:15. I only had one workout where I held 6:30 or faster for more than four consecutive miles, though I had a few workouts where the recovery miles in longer blocks were in the 6:45 to 7 range. I always finish both weekend runs with a 30 minute sauna session for heat adaptation.

I was in a strange mix of 30 to 55 mile weeks in July and August until I decided to actually choose a fall race. I signed up for Indy the first week of September, and the real training block ended up being pretty condensed. I had eight weeks of 65 to 70 miles a week.

I don’t do much for recovery beyond eating enough protein and carbs and trying to sleep about seven hours a night. I’m lucky that running doesn’t have a huge negative impact on my body or life other than occasionally being tired, since I often have to wake up before 5 am to run.

**Race**

Truly cannot recommend Indy enough. The weekend was seamless from start to finish. Easy, inexpensive flight from NYC, plenty of affordable hotels walkable to the start and expo. I ate ~450–500g of carbs the two days before the race. Race morning: 2 Maurten solids, a few graham crackers, coffee, beet juice. I jogged about half a mile to warm up and hopped into the A corral 15 minutes before the start — incredibly easy logistics.

I went in with almost no nerves. I knew I was fit enough to run a strong race and planned to start around 6:30 pace and adjust. The first ~7 miles overlap with the half, so it was a bit crowded but nowhere near major-marathon congestion, and I didn’t have to weave. My first 5K was my slowest at 6:32, though my watch showed ~6:25, so I didn’t realize it in the moment.

The early miles flew by. Effort felt controlled, almost surprisingly easy. I monitored HR to avoid drifting toward threshold (around 184 for me) and stayed in the 170–173 range, so I held back from pushing into the 6:20s too early since I hadn’t trained much at that pace. Around mile 8 I felt the start of my usual right-side stitch but was able to breathe through it and stay calm. The course was beautiful, and I was relaxed enough to take it in and even chat a bit with other runners — very out of character for me.

I started to feel the usual late-race fatigue around mile 20 but nothing unmanageable. I began moving toward 6:20 pace around that point and didn’t fully press until the last ~1.5 miles. In hindsight, I could’ve started the push a little earlier, but I’m happy with how I closed. I am pretty positive I left a few mins on the table and probably could have finished closer to 2:45 if I pushed my hr up to 176-177. 

Fueling: SIS Beta Fuel electrolytes gel at the start and then roughly every 4 miles. I didn’t fully finish the last few gels due to nerves about my stomach, so I took in around ~220g total. I skipped aid stations and carried a 0.5L handheld with electrolytes.

For anyone considering this race: it’s fantastic. Not as flat as Chicago, you’ll feel some gentle rollers, but nothing that meaningfully slows you down. The road-condition complaints you read are fair, though I only found footing tricky at the very beginning and one stretch near mile 20. It’s also extremely easy to spectate; my husband was able to bike the course and see me six times. I think this race will continue to grow, especially with recent early-fall marathons trending warm and Indy being so accessible for East Coast runners. They’re clearly encouraging more elite and sub-elite fields, and there were a ton of OTQ-level runners this year.

**Whats Next**

Still trying to figure that out. I think I am going to work on some shorter races, but maybe Eugene or Jersey City for a full, maybe a fun trail 50k. Part of me wonders if there's a tiny tiny possibility I could achieve an OTQ before the American qualifier cut off in early 2028 ( I'm not delusional — I know that 11 min jump is a much bigger stretch than the 20 min one I did this year). At the same time, I’m thinking about starting a family. And let’s be real, putting that on hold to chase a dream that won’t pay bills or earn me a podium,  won’t make sense to anyone but me. I know the odds were already razor slim, add pregnancy and postpartum recovery, and it's impossible. But just because there are things far more important than a hobby, doesn’t mean it doesn’t sting to think I might not even get the chance to chase it. It def weighs a little heavy, to finally trust that it wasn’t a fluke, to feel settled in my own strength, and to sense the window closing just as I start to believe I belong there. But such is the duality of being a woman in this sport.",53,1763152316.0,AdvancedRunning,10,0.98,False

however, ever since march i’ve been stuck in a cycle between 76-72kg that i just can not seem to get out of.


the way im doing it isn’t the most healthy… i have days where i eat nothing but drink an iced coffee, then days where i eat fast food and so on. i realized i’ve been in a cycle of gaining weight, stepping on the scale and realizing i’ve gained weight, then eating little amounts of food/mainly just drinking coffee. then the following days i eat out, or eat fast food, and welp you guessed it i gain the weight some more. it’s been this cycle im going through for the past 9 months, and decided to break it. yesterday i came to weigh myself to see it at 76.6kg, because i ate out. i was so close to losing it and doing the same thing i usually do which is eat nothing the following day and just have a coffee. however, this time i didn’t. i woke up and had a healthy breakfast of greek yogurt,  sourdough and avocados , i had my coffee as usual and i’ll also have a nice low cal dinner (still thinking of what to have) but anyways, my main point is how am i able to get out of this cycle exactly? did i do the right thing today by actually eating and if so should i continue this path and see where it takes me? and if anyone else has any advice on this whole situation thank you in advance",1,1763152210.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

I’m not posting this for attention or anything like that. I just wanted to put it somewhere honest.

At 10:40am on November 14, 2023, my phone rang (a random number I normally would’ve ignored) and it was the coordinator telling me they had a heart for me. I’ll never forget that moment. It felt like my whole life split into “before” and “after.”

The last two years have been a long mix of healing, fear, gratitude, setbacks, tiny wins, and a lot of learning. I found out how many people truly cared about me. I learned how strong my wife and son were while everything was falling apart. And I learned how much I actually wanted to stay alive.

Today I’m just grateful.
Grateful to still be here.
Grateful for my donor and their family.
Grateful for everyone who supported me, some of them probably without even realizing it.
Grateful I get to wake up, drink coffee, see my kid, and live a normal morning again.

If anyone scrolling through this is dealing with transplant stuff — waiting, worrying, recovering — you’re not alone. I’ve been there. It’s terrifying, but there’s a lot of hope on the other side.

I wrote out the whole story for myself today. If anyone wants to read it, I’ll drop the link in the comments. If not, that’s totally fine too.

Happy birthday to my new heart.
Still here.
Still fighting.
Still grateful.

1ox7g4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1ox7g4i/should_i_meet_him_again_i_need_some_advice/,Should I meet him again? I need some advice.,"Hello guys,

I really need some advice. I’ll try to explain my situation as briefly as possible:

Almost exactly two years ago, I (23F) met a coworker (29M) during my job training at this workplace. The whole thing lasted only about 10 weeks and was more like an internship. He was responsible for me, so we spent a lot of time together at work. But the thing was there was a connection between us back then like the chemistry just clicked, at least that’s how it felt to me. I really liked him, and I think he liked me too. That became especially clear to me at the company party (towards the end of those 10 weeks), where he practically threw his arms around me. He hugged me really tightly and affectionately (I can go into more detail if anyone wants). Sure, there was alcohol involved, but for me, that moment kind of changed everything.
And of course, I fell in love.

When my internship there ended, I had to leave the workplace with a heavy heart, and I really struggled with heartbreak. But we still kept in touch sporadically. He would check in every now and then we’d talk on the phone or text sometimes. About a year ago, I finally gathered all my courage and asked him to meet me for a coffee. That meeting did happen, but honestly, it was awful. The vibe was weird, and then all of a sudden, he started talking about his girlfriend, and I basically died inside. I had really been hoping for something. After that, I fell into a pretty deep emotional hole. I was really not doing well. But after about half a year, I managed to process the disappointment fairly well.

So, recently, it was my birthday, and of course, he remembered. We had almost no contact for a year, since that coffee date that went so badly for me. I thanked him for the birthday wishes and said that I appreciated that he still remembered after all this time (which I honestly don’t take for granted). And he just replied, “of course.” Then, the next day, he suddenly wants to meet up for coffee again. he texted, „I must have a lot to tell him“. I’ve finished my training and started my first full-time job, so maybe that’s what he wants to talk about… but I have no idea.

I really don’t know if I should agree to meet him. I still like him so much. But when I think about how miserable I was last year because of him, I feel like I can only say no. I also don’t see him as just a platonic friend. I have this feeling that it will backfire and I’ll end up regretting it deeply.
On the other hand, there’s also that thought, what if he’s changed his perspective now, and I miss my chance? Would I regret that for the rest of my life?

I need advice. Why would he want to meet me again..? What would you do if you were in my shoes?

1ox7dso,https://www.thedailybeast.com/taco-trump-already-crumbling-on-his-sweeping-tariffs,"TACO Trump Plots Humiliating U-Turn on Beloved Policy, Moves to Slash Food Tariffs Amid Rising Affordability Crisis","In a significant shift to its core economic policy, Trump is preparing to exempt a selection of imported foods from tariffs as it races to address a mounting national concern over the high cost of groceries. The move represents a tactical retreat on the administration's signature import tariff policy, prioritizing immediate consumer relief over trade protectionism.

Sources close to the administration confirmed the impending exemptions, which are expected to cover staple items such as beef, citrus fruits, coffee, and bananas. The goal is explicit: to drive down consumer prices that have fueled a measurable rise in household economic anxiety.

The forthcoming action goes a step further than a September executive order which directed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to consider exemptions only for products sourced from nations with preferential trade agreements. The new plan is likely to extend tariff relief even to imports from countries that have not negotiated specific trade deals with the U.S.

The decision comes as the administration faces increasing public scrutiny over ""affordability,"" a term that has become a political flashpoint. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, 63, championed the expected changes on Wednesday, telling Fox News that the exemptions for coffee and bananas, in particular, ""will bring the prices down very quickly."" He also placed responsibility for the current economic strain on previous administrations, stating the current White House ""inherited this affordability mess.""

However, the administration’s focus on the issue appears less organic and more reactive. Public opinion has soured, with consumer confidence hitting a six-month low at the end of October. Furthermore, the issue of household expenses proved decisive in recent elections, as Democrats successfully campaigned on affordability to secure gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, and the mayoral race in New York.

While the policy is being framed as an effort to stabilize the economy for consumers, it also serves as a crucial political intervention. Commerce Secretary Lutnick, 64, has reportedly been a strong internal voice advocating for the food exemptions, citing current cost levels as untenable.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai acknowledged the balancing act in a statement to The New York Times, asserting that the administration remains committed to ""a nimble, nuanced, and multifaceted strategy on trade and tariffs.""

Officials also pointed to a recent surge in international commerce agreements, including new deals announced Thursday with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Ecuador, as providing the framework for these exemptions.

Despite the administration's continued claims that consumer prices are ""way down,"" the action on tariffs underscores the reality that affordability has emerged as the most significant economic challenge facing the White House as it looks ahead.",1,1763151586.0,politics_NOW,0,1.0,False
1ox7dj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestUnfiltered/comments/1ox7dj6/should_i_meet_him_again_i_need_some_advice/,Should I meet him again? I need some advice.,"Hello everyone,

I really need some advice urgently. I’ll try to explain my situation as briefly as possible:

Almost exactly two years ago, I (23F) met a coworker (29M) during my job training at this workplace. The whole thing lasted only about 10 weeks and was more like an internship. He was responsible for me, so we spent a lot of time together at work. But the thing was there was a connection between us back then like the chemistry just clicked, at least that’s how it felt to me. I really liked him, and I think he liked me too. That became especially clear to me at the company party (towards the end of those 10 weeks), where he practically threw his arms around me. He hugged me really tightly and affectionately (I can go into more detail if anyone wants). Sure, there was alcohol involved, but for me, that moment kind of changed everything.
And of course, I fell in love.

When my internship there ended, I had to leave the workplace with a heavy heart, and I really struggled with heartbreak. But we still kept in touch sporadically. He would check in every now and then we’d talk on the phone or text sometimes. About a year ago, I finally gathered all my courage and asked him to meet me for a coffee. That meeting did happen, but honestly, it was awful. The vibe was weird, and then all of a sudden, he started talking about his girlfriend, and I basically died inside. I had really been hoping for something. After that, I fell into a pretty deep emotional hole. I was really not doing well. But after about half a year, I managed to process the disappointment fairly well.

So, recently, it was my birthday, and of course, he remembered. We had almost no contact for a year, since that coffee date that went so badly for me. I thanked him for the birthday wishes and said that I appreciated that he still remembered after all this time (which I honestly don’t take for granted). And he just replied, “of course.” Then, the next day, he suddenly wants to meet up for coffee again. he texted, „I must have a lot to tell him“. I’ve finished my training and started my first full-time job, so maybe that’s what he wants to talk about… but I have no idea.

I also don’t see him as just a platonic friend. I have this feeling that it will backfire and I’ll end up regretting it deeply.
On the other hand, there’s also that thought, what if he’s changed his perspective now, and I miss my chance? Would I regret that for the rest of my life?

Outside of the deep pit of my depression which I’ve thankfully crawled out of successfully, the problem was never not doing stuff. That’s the trick, your brain always finds something new and awesome you could be doing, some new, wild project to follow. But it’s always smoke and mirrors, in the end, what you *should’ve* been pursuing, your real goals, they’re always failed. Oh it’s never your fault, it’s always an administrative mistake, an info you didn’t have, a statistical anomaly, “oh I was just unlucky”.



Excuses excuses excuses. One of life’s biggest lessons is that you can never let **anything** up to chance. You take every possible opportunity to ensure your plan will work, you check every possible outcome, you go out of your way to gather as much information as you want. Cause that’s just what life is. A bunch of random events that articulate between one another. So if you just bank it all on the one outcome you managed to imagine, you’re gonna get your teeth kicked in. You have to find all the possible outcomes, and do everything in your power to have them fit your goal.



Unfortunately, that’s a lesson I still haven’t learned to this day. Which is why when the reaper greeted me, when life was slipping between my very fingers, all I could think of was “at least I won’t have to worry about my future now”.



It all happened a couple hours ago, looking back, I still don’t understand all of it. 

After a day of rotting in bed, playing games and genuinely being a nuisance to life itself, I decided to go have an evening walk in the nearby glades. Doing something actually meaningful with my life, you know. That meaning might be kind of weak, “enjoying nature” and whatnot, but to me that’s a big leap already.



The woods were dark, not the full shade of a night sky, but rather the sort of setting sun lowlight unique to Autumn. Those times always feel weird, an in-between of day and night, light and dark, life and death. And, strangely enough, I always find it hardest to see then. At night, there’s lamposts highlighting what you need to see, and you can always use your phone’s flashlight. But in the dimmed light of evening, you can barely see details 20 feet in front of you, the seasonal fog not helping whatsoever.



After only twenty minutes of walking, I felt a shiver run down my spine. At first I thought it was simply those random shudders you get sometimes, your nerves reminding themselves that you’re still alive and all that jazz. But the feeling wouldn’t go away. I remembered those videos explaining that humans can feel when they’re being watched, something to do with our ancestral need to not be hunted by nightly lurkers.



 Well, in that moment, I felt just like those neanderthals must’ve felt. Paranoid up the ass, and constantly looking back and around me. Now, of course I could’ve just called it here, turned around and went home, but that would be accepting defeat, accepting that I was weaker than whatever irrational fear I was feeling at the moment, accepting yet another defeat in my life. So I kept walking. Would that I knew then, maybe things would’ve gone differently.



I noticed it around 5 blocks after first feeling the shiver. A dark blur, an unseen shadow, barely perceptible, always slightly out of sight. That’s how I noticed it, I could never quite see it, but if you looked closely enough, one could notice the *absence* of something, where, clearly, there should be. I didn’t panic, however. At this point, it was still just a shadow in the distance. And I was chalking it up to imagination.



I first felt true fear 10 blocks later. The sun had already settled by then, and twilight had set in, reducing visibility outside of the warm orange glow of the lamposts ever more. The shade was nowhere. I felt everything but relief. That thing, that shadow that had been following me everywhere this whole time was now just gone ? 

And I was to believe it had simply lost interest or found another target ?



Not me, buddy. I’ve spent more than enough wasting at my computer reading creepy stories and SCP entries to know that is **not** how these things go. But, before I could even tell my body to start running for it, the shadow appeared again. This time, far closer, just behind a lamp post, hiding in its shadow only a couple feet in front of me.



I was stunned in shocked silence. It was much more visible now. It was all wrong, all dark eyes and fleshy tendrils, with no real shape to speak of. It just was, and it sure was real close.



All at once, it was all over me. Literally. Tendrils were keeping me pinned to the ground. The suddenness of the impact stole the breath out of my lungs. Teeth and claws and bones were tearing and prodding at me. And hundreds of purple red eyes were all fixated on me with an animalistic rage on them, glinting like the glow of long dead stars, with just as much ancient knowledge and alien intelligence upon them.



As my guts started spilling out and being filled with ever more tentacles and probes, I wasn’t feeling scared anymore, despite the cold. No, what I felt was peace. And, funnily enough, excitement. Finally, something interesting, something unexpected happened to me. The only shame is that I won’t be able to tell anyone about it. Welp, I think, the last bit of life fading from me, I hope if there’s an afterlife it’s similar to Corbenic, that’d be rad as hell.

  
  


\~\~\~\~

  
  


That all happened I want to say two hours ago. Time has been very wonky since then. I woke up with a jolt inside my room, but not in my bed. I just gained consciousness standing on the floor, feeling the worst pain I’ve ever felt. It hurt, all over, all at once. I didn’t even know that was possible. You know when your head hurts but you bang your toe so you don’t feel the headache for a while ?

Well that was **not** the case here, at all. I could feel every skin pore, every articulation, every fucking nerve ending, and all were on fire.



I’m starting to feel a little better now, everything still feels very goddamn sore, but I’m slowly regaining control, and my thoughts are getting less scrambled as a result.



This would be great news, if a clone of me didn’t just walk into my room and plopped right onto my bed like he owned the place.



I recognized him instantly. Although, I’m unsure if I should even call it “him”. That thing that attacked me clearly stole my face, and is now trying to steal my life. Great, just great. I would’ve jumped at him, if not for the fact that even lifting my middle finger hurts like a thousand hammers are all trying to break it. That and I’d rather not redo the whole “thousand tentacles ripping you apart thing”.



A couple more hours have passed. The pain is still so great I keep fading in and out of consciousness, still wholly unable to move. That is the positive, though. At first the hurt was so great my mind wasn’t even capable of shutting down. The sun is starting to rise now, and I’m starting to feel extremely damn sleepy. Hopefully I feel better when I wake up.



\~\~



The light is already getting low. I can tell, because it’s coming from my left wall window. If it was morning it’d be coming from the right wall. Fuck. How long did I sleep for ?

And I’ve been standing still the whole time ? Did no one see me ? I suppose if that imposter left for school there’d be no reason for dad to come in my room. Shit, I’ll have to find a way to deal with it today. If the internet has taught me one thing about those monsters, is you *cannot* let them take root for long. 



I can move a bit now at least, that’s an improvement. A slight inspection reveals that I’m wearing my bathrobe, as I’d typically do when staying home doing nothing all day. I realize with horror when trying to pick up my coffee mug that my fingers pass right through it.



Am I dead ? I quickly sober up. Of course I’m fucking dead, that thing ate over half my body. Well, I’m somewhat glad. This confirms about half my theories about the afterlife. I’ve got a LOT of experimenting to do with this shit now. Can I emit Akiva radiation ? Can I move object like a poltergeist ? Can I create cold spots ?



My questioning is cut short as the door opens. He’s back. 



“HEY” I try shouting.



He doesn’t seem to flinch. Can he even see me ? Isn’t he supposed to be some kind of outer reality abomination ?



Shit, well I’m not sure what to do now.



He turned on my laptop. Peering behind his shoulder, I can see it’s 17:54. He opens youtuber, starts watching a playthrough of a game I’d wanted to watch myself.



After a couple minutes, he hasn’t moved, wholly absorbed. I’m not gonna lie, I was too.



I snap out of it, though. It’s 6pm, I have to go make dinner for my family.



How am I going to do that as a ghost. He has to go do it.



He’s still watching, completely oblivious to everything.



I am not going to let that fuck have my parents I’ve let myself go even more.



“HEY”



“LISTEN UP YOU FUCKING DUMBASS”



Still no reaction.



I feel white hot anger bubble within me, threatening to explode. I was never that pathetic. I’m not going to let whatever that thing is let anyone think otherwise.



“***YOU BETTER LISTEN UP YOU MOTHERFUCKER”***



He jumps.



“Who just said that ?” he looks around the room, a cruel curious look in his eyes. It’s an expression I’ve had before so it doesn’t look alien, but I definitely wouldn’t have reacted that way if a disembodied voice suddenly screamed in my ear.



“***You have to go make dinner you asshole. I won’t have you have people think I’m any more lazy than I already was***”



I’ve figured out how to carry my voice, finally. It’s something to do with contracting my thorax the right way, and emitting enough heat. In fact, small sparks of flame are starting to randomly appear around me, and his eyes have instantly locked onto there. 



It’s sort of unnerving seeing him sizing me up like a piece of meat despite not being able to see me. I remind myself that I have the upper hand, he doesn’t seem to know what I am.

In the back of my mind, I also make a small note of the possible nature of Will’O’Wisps and their relation to spectral energy radiation.



“So, you’re the original owner of that body, then?” He seems a lot more relaxed now. “Can’t say I’ve had *that* happen before, but you have to accept the loss and move on, human. I’m in charge now.”



“***You’re in charge? Don’t make me laugh, buddy. You’ve been doing nothing but rotting in bed and watching youtube. What’s so high and mighty about you?***”



My anger has reached its peak. I’m not thinking anymore. I instinctively replicate what he did to me yesterday. I leap on him, plunge my hands in his chest, though they pass right through. 



I can feel energy crackling in and out of me, like I’m nothing more than a lightning strike, existing only in this fleeting moment, only to be loud and bright and very very destructive.



And he screams. His scream sounds nothing like a human. It sounds like a mix of a goat howling and the horrible screeching you hear when you earphones malfunction. It hurts me, but I can tell he hurts more so I keep going. Whatever he is, whatever I am, I clearly have the upper hand at the moment.



My victory ended, however. Whatever power or unholy magic I’d conjured up ran dry. I feel empty and cold and the pain is back. The pain. The pain.



The pain.



\~\~\~



Like that first night, I keep fading in an out of consciousness for what I think has been 4 days now. 



\~\~\~



I come to, finally. Still in the same spot. I look over, he’s on my pc, playing Warframe. Welp, at least if he keeps my account topped up that’s good.



“You’re back” he says.



“***You can see me now?”*** My voice feels dry, which is very weird considering I don’t have vocal chords anymore. And it takes me a couple tries to vocalize.



“No, I don’t know what type of ethereal realm you exist on, maggot. I’ve simply adjusted my neurological sensors to electromagnetic fields since what you did to me back then. I can’t see you, but you’re a whole electric storm over there.”



“***Ah. Playing Warframe ? Did you get to MR17 yet ?***”



He looks mildly annoyed.



“Yeah, whatever. Only crafted a couple other primes. What do you care anyways, you’re dead. This doesn’t affect you anymore”



“***It’s my account I’ve had since I was 14. This very much affects me still. How much have you been playing to get there so fast?”*** I was never motivated for big grinds, but that speed is concerning.



“Eh, 10 hours everyday, give or take. I was underestimating how much it’d take farming for relics, then opening the relics, then selling, then buying, ect. whole can of worms, this game.”



***“You haven’t been going to class…?”*** My voice is a single, flat line. The hot anger I felt back then isn’t here this time. All I feel is contempt, pure and clear. My thoughts are focused on all the ways I can make the fucker pay.



“Eh, you wouldn’t have gone either, too much snow. You know buses are shitty”



He’s so,... nonchalant about throwing his life away like that. Was I truly like that ? Did I really find these stupid reasons to justify not doing even the bare minimum, only to follow fleeting interests ?



I collect myself.



“***Listen, ‘guy’, this is MY life you’ve taken. So you can destroy yourself all you want, but I will NOT have you destroy my image any more. I’ll be very simple, you go to class, you do what you need to do to keep my parents happy, you stay well adjusted, and I won’t fry you. Are we clear ?***”



He looks at me, a look of surprised disbelief on his face. Then he smiles, a wicked grin of twisted amusement.



“Fine, I’ll entertain you, maggot. I still don’t know what you’ve become, but don’t take you getting the drop on my the other day for anything other than a lucky shot. One day or the other some bigger fish from the realm you’re in will smell you, and know that, when that day comes, I’ll be laughing and pissing on your grave.”



\~\~\~



It’s been about three months since that all transpired. Ever since then, I’ve grown accustomed to my new existence. The occasional zapping seems to have cost me my humanity, seeing as I now sport talons instead of fingers, but EH, what can a ghost do with fingers anyways.

We have a sort of queasy peace with my double. Since I successfully managed to leave the house, I follow him to school giving him tips on social interactions. The guy may be some cosmic elder god or whatever, but he CANNOT take a hint.



The only other event of note was when a guy came up to us when we were walking home one day. Though more specifically he was walking, I was just drifting by. 



“You!” he said, looking right at me. “I know what you are, let me help you.”



“Watch your tongue, mortal.” The clone answered.



“Hey now, listen here, kids. My name is Ben Teners. I’m an expert on this kind of stuff, I can hel-”

He was cut short by my double grabbing him, letting me see those dreaded tendrils for the first time in so long. Seeing it from an outside perspective was kind of trippy let me tell you.



“***Did you just fucking kill that guy, bro ?***”



“They can’t all be lucky to be immortal like you, maggot”

But guess what? I've found something that's *actually* making a difference, and it's so simple even *I* can stick with it. We're talking a ridiculously easy 5-minute morning routine.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Five minutes? That's it? No way that'll do anything!"" Hear me out. It's not about crazy contortions or hardcore yoga. It's about getting the blood flowing and waking up those grumpy muscles.

Here’s the lowdown:

*   **Gentle Neck Rolls:** Clockwise, then counter-clockwise. Imagine you’re drawing circles with your nose. Feels good, right? Helps release that neck tension from sleeping in weird positions (we all do it!).

*   **Shoulder Shrugs:** Up to your ears, then release. Think about dropping all that stress and tension *right* out of your shoulders. Ahhhh...

*   **Arm Circles:** Forward and backward. Small circles at first, then gradually bigger. Channel your inner airplane!

*   **Torso Twists:** Just a gentle twist from side to side. Imagine you're wringing out a wet towel (but gently, of course!). This one is a game-changer for my lower back.

*   **Ankle Rotations:** Point your toes and rotate each ankle. Sounds basic, but gets the blood flowing to your feet!

That’s it! Five minutes. That's less time than it takes to make coffee (okay, maybe the *first* cup of coffee!).

I swear, doing this little routine has made a HUGE difference in how I feel throughout the day. I used to shuffle around like an old grandpa (no offense to grandpas!), but now I feel a little more…springy.

And you know what? ""We believe in strongest people."" and we know that yoga and fitness can help, I’ve even found this great freebie guide with some extra stretches and at-home workout ideas if you want to kick it up a notch: [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts)

Seriously, give it a try for a week and see what you think. What have you got to lose but some stiffness? 😉 What are your favorite ways to ease into the day? Maybe you have a secret morning ritual you're willing to share?",0,1763151340.0,RetirementReady,0,0.5,False

Münchner Relic Hunter aufgepasst!

Der neueste **Relic Key** ist gedroppt, aber dieses Mal **anders** als sonst! Normalerweise findet ihr die Keys unter Bänken oder Fenstersimsen, doch das **Deutsche Patent- und Markenamt** (Ihr wisst schon, das Gebäude an der Isar mit dem kleinen Park!) war eine Herausforderung. **Keine einzige Bank!** 🤯

Das Foundryon HQ musste kreativ werden. Das auffällige Feature im Park ließ keine Versteckmöglichkeit zu, also:

➡️ **Der Key ist in einem nahegelegenen Baum platziert!**

Beeilung! Holt euch den Key, loggt euch in die Online-Lore-Konsole des Foundryon-Universums ein und beansprucht euren Eintrag! Und Level Bonus!

Viel Glück und Happy Hunting! 🗝️",1,1763151224.0,foundryon,0,1.0,False

I'm posting this because I've been playing Dark Souls 3 non-stop for 6 hours straight after my shift. And I completed the base game...


And so I though: ""If an Artorias skin is already in the game for Guts, why not add whole Dark Souls units?
They already did a Guilty Gear one, so it would be fire and plausible.
And why is Sister Friede actually kind of...""

Aaanyways. Just wanted to get that out of my chest. I'll probably go to bed now and doom-scroll for the last few hours since I'm running on 4 cups of coffee like Himeko from Honkai Star Rail.

Have a great day/night/whatever. I'm too tired for this. Bye!

PS: Oh and here's some art of my favourite boss in this gaming session. Sister Friede and ESPECIALLY Father Ariandel. God, his design is sooo fucking god. And that scream during the transition?! Unequaled. I'm so excited to fight her 3rd phase soon.",4,1763151196.0,AnimeVanguard,3,1.0,False
