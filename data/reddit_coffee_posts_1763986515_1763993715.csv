Hello all my merry fellow readers!

I have a problem. I have too many books, or…. I have nowhere to store them. I have filled a bookshelf and have also piled books on windowsills, on the floor, in the kitchen cabinets and on a coffee table.

I need a new bookshelf, but I don't have unlimited space and I also want the bookshelf to be a bit nice. So my question to you is if I can see your bookshelves for tips and inspiration.

So dear friends, can you suggest a bookshelf and a book that fits perfectly into it(not size wise)

1p5i1ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1p5i1ad/mtf4m_im_his_best_friend_not_his_girlfriendlover/,[MtF4M] I'm his best friend not his girlfriend/lover!,"Sharing my first and own IRL inspired AU story. Let me know your opinions about it!

Hi my name is Audie Torres but “aud” works just fine, I’m about 5’11” with a lean and athletic build. In high school I was the star point guard of my school’s basketball team, but I wasn’t just your typical sporty jock, I was also a really huge nerd when it came to learning (yes I had high IQ both on the court and in the classroom), Now in college I’m already a 4th year dental student, as for my hoop career, before deciding for college I already accepted that it peaked in high school because I didn’t receive a playing offer from any major universities beforehand. Thankfully I’m smart enough to choose a degree rather than betting all my eggs at basketball.

Luckily at dental school I met a fellow hoop junkie, my best friend, Lewis Sanchez. But unlike me, he could have both a degree and a career at basketball. He was one of the top prospects in high school basketball in the Philippines and received multiple offers from other schools, given that he stood at 6’5” with a defined muscular and athletic build, and the shooting guard/small forward game to back it up (In my opinion, he never really looked right being a dentist lol), he chose the same college as me because it was the only college university that had a dental program. 

When we met in our first year we instantly hit it off especially when we played basketball against our seniors (In my high school I never played with a guy as talented as him, which made playing point guard so easier), it also helped that we were both good looking tall individuals who loved aura farming the ladies (Especially in a program like dentistry where the ratio is 80% females and 20% males). I was also present when he played against the other universities, and after his games I would critique him about how he played (He respected my basketball IQ enough to accept it). We were like brothers, inseparable, even in school when I struggle in anatomy he teaches me and I return the favor in biological chemistry.

While surviving dental school we also met the beautiful and kind Leah Quebec, who would soon make Lewis fall for her (with a little help from me of course). I loved Leah like a sister and as partner for my best friend, but it annoyed me when she often tried to make me commit to a single girl (not happening I was still enjoying my young adult life). At the start, the two were like a match made in heaven, and I was the angel who banded them together. But as the years went by, God proved otherwise that I made a terrible mistake getting them together.

Over our years together I got to know both of them dearly as my closest friends (yes all the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of them). The gist was that Leah was too passive and un-confrontational, she neglected to talk about heavy feelings in the relationship and acted always on her own, Lewis on the other hand was really toxic and emotionally unstable, having an ego that constantly needed appraisal, not to mention he was also verbally abusive to Leah, calling her different degrading names when they were having tension in the relationship. This started the cycle of them being on and off and me being in the middle when they fight fully knowing that they’re just opposite people who can’t change for each other. I comfort Leah about Lewis definitely needing to change and that she doesn’t deserve a man like that (I’ve known Lewis a long time, and am 100% sure he will never change), while at the same time, endlessly begging Lewis to change for Leah stating that even though she’s very uncommunicative and insensitive at times he should have some restraint on what he says to her (I could finish this story only with all the things I said to them over the years and talking about how toxic they are to project their personal unhealed traumas to one another lol, but don’t worry you’ll get to know them more as the story progresses).

Now this is where the story truly begins, after years of being caught at the middle of endless fights, Leah finally did it, she broke up and cut ties with him permanently for her own peace, but over the course of them being apart she was still relapsing from time to time because she still loved him, me knowing this relationship better than them and care more for both their well being at this point, I guiltily played the devils advocate and chose to gas light both of them about their love for each other, Leah took it better as usual and chose to heal on her own, but I was still left with an emotional reck of a best friend, He asked for company in going to a club for drinks and for him to try and get his mind off Leah, so we enjoyed the night partying, drinking, and flirting with women, until it was about 3am when I had to drag Lewis and all 6’5” of him out of there because he had a big game the following day against a rival university, but I had to sober him up first or he might just puke in the car, I dragged him barely standing up through countless alleys (I was screaming in my head, “where the fuck are all the 711’s when you need them!”). I was tired from dragging his drunk ass, so we sat at the curb of a street, where he was still half drunk talking about how he missed Leah, to which I replied, “You made out with five hoes tonight Lew, five!” he playfully rebutted saying “You’re getting soft brother, are you mad that only managed four hoes tonight?”. We both ended up laughing as I punched the side of his head saying “that was not the point you big idiot!”. Just then I barely saw a tiny cafe that was open this late at night. I told Lewis and thankfully he had regained some strength to stand on his own and walk to the cafe.

As we make our way inside the cafe we were greeted by the barista welcoming us by saying “what can I do for you guys tonight?”, Lewis’s half drunk mouth immediately replied, “can you get me a new girlfriend, preferably not on the crazy side”, the barista just laughed and said “sorry thats not on our specials today sir” and I joined in saying “I’m sorry for this big drunk idiot sir, could we just have some of your house blended coffee to sober up?”, The barista happily noded his head and began brewing.

The following conversation took place as we were waiting for our coffee:

Lewis: Bro I’m sorry about how me and Leah have been such a pain in your ass for years

Me: Its cool man, I’ve known you longer than Leah, I’m just surprised she lasted this long after encountering your consistent anger issues.

Lewis: Come one man, it’s not never ending, I only flare up when she just ignores me and starts being nonchalant.

(*Bartender proceeds to listen while making our coffee*)

Me: Thats just who she is dude, but you trash-talking her like when you’re hooping doesn’t help the problem. And to be fair bro you do affect all of us around you when you get mad, you can’t handle your emotions well even on the court, it just so happened that I know the real you well enough to dismiss it and say it to your stupid face.

Lewis: Sorry man, thanks for being a real one. I wish Leah could have been more like you. I think thats what I need in a woman, someone who can guide my decisions and assertive enough to call me out and explain what I should do to get better as a person.

Me: You do realize you’re describing either a mother or a point guard for a hooper’s pov?

Lewis: I’m not one of those guys that have a mom fetish but maybe I can find a nice point guard like you sooner or later.

Me: Thats so gay bro stfu.

Lewis: I’m just saying bro that theoretically you’ve seen all sides of me and lasted from all of the good to the bad, and if the latest iPhone could air drop that experience and ability to a woman I would buy it immediately.

Me: Still gay dude, stop it even if it’s true.

Lewis: Remember when I used the snapchat filter that made you look like a girl. You resembled your mom so much, and she’s hot! Even when I sent it to my teammates they asked for your socials!  

Me: bro come on, if you seriously weren’t drunk right now I’d punch you. 

Lewis: And thats why, you get me enough to not be sensitive cause you know I’m just messing with you!

Me: Yes, now can we finally stop with all the gayness and change the topic to something else, like which of those hoes did you enjoy feeling up the most dude? 

Lewis: Oh yeah bro! I mean Leah had great curves and all, but I think I prefer my next one to be a somewhat similar body type to those hoes we felt up.

Me: Alright then lets build your ideal girl’s body

(*Bartender proceeds to listen more closely as he’s getting ready to serve our coffee*)

Lewis: Lets see, I think Leah’s height was quite my ideal because I was able to lift her around while doing her,  but maybe a little bit taller and long legged so when she arches, her pussy is just the exact height for me.

Me: You gotta chill bro! That’s still Leah we’re objectifying hahahaha.

Lewis: Nahh bro I’m pulling out all the stops, next for body shape, I want her to have a normal healthy version of Kendall Jenner’s slim and sexy body type with the ass and curves so she doesn’t look like a starving model. Yeah! and for the boobs, I’ll be honest I like them big but not too big.

Me: Leah also failed you there I presume?

Lewis: Yeah, she could never really fully embrace my dick with her pair and coudn’t grab on to them when doing her. So maybe I’ll go with anything in between a C and D cup, those would look plenty big enough for a slim model body and my dick would still look big even while they’re sandwiched between.

Me: Looks like I wasn’t the only one into anime girls as a kid! She would look so hot!

Lewis: Yeah bro! Then we just transfer your attitude to her!

Me: You’ve been so gay tonight buddy, anyway here comes our coffee.

Barista: Sorry for wait gentlemen, here are your comet cups.

Me and Lewis: Why are they called comet cups?

Barista: Because like a comet, you make a wish the first time you see or experience it. Or at least that’s thats the cringey line I like to tell our drunk customers.

Me and Lewis proceeded to do it anyway. Thinking of my friend, all I wished at that moments was for him to finally receive the girl meant for him. I then sipped the coffee which had a delightful taste and within seconds of sipping I didn’t feel the alcohol anymore, instead I felt the rush of caffeine, maybe a little too much? I started to get dizzy with palpitating, everything spinning and getting fuzzy as I glanced over at the barista and then to Lewis, I could tell he was feeling the same, and we both blacked out and fell to the floor…

As I awoke to the smell of morning breeze, I’m in my bed thinking that everything was just a dream. But I felt heavy when breathing, like something was sitting on my chest, I immediately sit up on my bed and felt its weight move but it was still attached to me. Moreover I felt my hair slide at the back of my neck which confused me since I know I just got a haircut last week. I then looked around as my eyes widened, “this is my room! but what happened to it?!” all the furniture I recognize were all in place and the positions I like, but why the hell was the room full of girly shit? I got up and rushed immediately to the restroom to wash my face figuring I was still in a dream. Upon reaching the mirror though I saw, well, me! But not completely me! The girl version of me!

I believed the keto / carnivore people when they said LDL isn't bad, and besides, it's caused by high sugar/carbs NOT animal fats. So I studiously avoided it while piling on saturated fat. I lost weight so all must be fine, right?

I believed the anti- seed oil people when they said THAT was the root cause, and I developed a habit of using butter/ghee/etc and treated vegetable oils as toxic.

I believed the ""some people just have higher blood pressure, and it's not that bad"" people because I was otherwise healthy and the vague description of ""it will hurt your organs eventually, kidneys, retinas, etc"" was easy to brush off.

I believed the anti-pharma people that it's a travesty to be on a medication for the rest of your life, and that statins are a scam money-making thing.

I believed strident YouTuber ""doctors"" that med school has almost no education in nutrition and most physicians' beliefs about the need for medication was from Pharma reps marketing lunches. Whether or not there might be elements of truth to that, it doesn't invalidate the medical consensus that's emerged especially in the last 10 years.

I believed the finding that high coffee consumption isn't bad for health (in fact, it can be good) only to discover that my espresso habit is likely contributing 10 - 20 points to my LDL.

I believed red meat was fine, a natural part of our diet from an evolutionary perspective, and that all this hubabaloo about the Mediterranean diet was an over-excited media towing the party line. 

And here we are, CAC of 9, CCTA showing lots of soft plaque, LDL at 137, and I'm only 42.

So it turns out that a huge part of what I've believed for 10+ years is almost opposite on THE most important health question (and THE most likely thing to kill me).

TO BE CLEAR: these are all my own failures, my choosing to just listen to the pleasing confirmatory nonsense peddled by YT influencers versus doing the hard research or going deep into things myself. But now, everywhere I turn, my ""conventional wisdom"" I developed over the last 5-10 years is almost opposite to what I need to do now.

Such a weird headspace to find oneself in. But glad I got here.

Been here all along? What does that mean?

I subconsciously avoided the implied meaning in Aron's words.

Or rather, I instinctively rejected that possibility. At least for the current me, it felt too intangible, or rather, such a possibility was not permitted to exist.

Not even a shred.

Even to further extinguish any suggestive undertones in Aron's words.

I pretended to be innocent, turning the tables by teasing him.

""What? Been here all along, yearning and waiting eagerly for Maria to come home?""

How much of this was teasing, how much was indescribable resentment, or venting dissatisfaction on behalf of my past self, was already unclear and hard to define.

I only knew that after these words left my mouth, the original ambiguous atmosphere vanished without a trace, replaced by endless silence and that gaze that remained fixed on me.

I thought I could endure this endless silence.

But, in reality, I didn't manage.

Sarah Lopez, the person in front of you is no longer your sweetheart. There's no need for you to care so much about him.

I turned around and operated the coffee grinder, grinding the beans into powder, then wetting them with water, letting the drops fall to become coffee liquid poured into a cup.

I could no longer bear being alone in the same room with Aron, but there was one question I must ask.

""Aron, let me ask you a question."" I weighed my words carefully. ""If one day, you had to choose between two people, how would you choose?""

He didn't expect my question, frowned slightly, and confirmed my question again.

""What kind of choice?""

""For example..."" I paused, trying to maintain an objective and fair tone. ""If your duty and your heart conflict, which one would you choose?""

Aron answered without hesitation: ""A true Alpha must prioritize the bigger picture, but the premise is not to violate his own moral bottom line.""

""You must choose one."" I pressed on.

Aron clearly didn't expect me to be so aggressive. He looked me up and down with a scrutinizing gaze.

Though fearful, I met his gaze directly, waiting for his answer.

After a long time, he saw my persistence for an answer, shook his head with a bitter smile, and gave his answer.

""Then I hope I never have to face such a choice.""

This answer reminded me of something. In my previous life, he faced such choices countless times, and every time, he chose Maria. Now he says he hopes not to face such a choice. How ironic.

""Yes, I hope neither of us encounters such a choice."" I lost the mood to continue entangling with him, picked up my coffee, and headed upstairs.

""Sarah."" He stopped me again. ""Tomorrow's ceremony... no matter the outcome, I hope we both get what we wish for.""

Get what we wish for?

I turned back, looking at the sincerity in his eyes. Perhaps at this moment, he is sincere.

But I also know that sincerity changes in an instant. When the choice comes, he will abandon me without hesitation.

""Of course."" I replied with a smile. ""I wish that both you and I can get what we wish for.""

When I went downstairs again, it was already bustling and crowded with people.

Maria happily spun around in her newly bought dress in front of Aron. The two of them were surrounded by a group of childhood friends who grew up with the three of us.

Dylan and Katherine sat at the round table, carefully discussing with the Pack's elders how to handle potential mishaps and accidents tomorrow.

When everyone saw me coming downstairs, the scene fell silent for a few seconds before returning to its noisy state.

Right. Although I've also lived in the Pack for over ten years, I'm not as likable as Maria.

Compared to making friends, I prefer being alone.

""Sarah, come try the long dress we bought for you. It will look beautiful on you.""

Seeing me come down, Katherine excused herself from the elders and took two long dresses from the sofa to show me.

One was the lake-blue dress I specified, the other was a fiery red one that Maria liked very much.

I discreetly glanced at Maria and noticed she was also watching, seemingly waiting for me to make a choice.

Which one to choose?

Seeing Maria's expectant gaze, my eyes lingered on that unignorable fiery red.

The dress fabric was satin, composed of two layers of tulle skirt. The outer layer was adorned with fringe, visually dazzling.

Katherine was right; it would look beautiful on me.

Under everyone's gaze, I picked up the fiery red dress and walked up the steps.

If it were before, I would have chosen another, because fiery red was Maria's favorite color, and I wouldn't compete with her for attention. But now, I don't want to yield.

Inevitable whispers arose downstairs.

""Doesn't she know Maria likes fiery red the most?""

""How could Sarah not know? They grew up together as sisters.""

""Then why did she choose it? Sarah is like an ugly duckling. Even if she wears that dress, she can't compare to Maria.""

Maria's friends all felt indignant on her behalf.

They controlled their volume extremely well; unless you were surrounded by them, you couldn't hear what they were saying at all.

But, I'm different.

My ears twitched slightly.

I command natural magic. Wherever plants are, they are my eyes and ears.

I changed into the dress and stood in front of the full-length mirror, looking at my reflection as if separated by a lifetime.

In my past life, before the awakening ceremony, I always picked plain, quiet dresses to distinguish myself from Maria.

After becoming Luna, my status necessitated it, and I gradually developed a preference for dignified, elegant clothing.

This was the first time I wore such a bright, dazzling dress.

I unexpectedly detected fluctuations of magic elements downstairs. Out of curiosity, I lightly hooked my fingertip.

The leaf tips of the pothos plant beside the sofa downstairs quietly swayed.

Through the pothos, the first thing I saw was Aron sitting on the sofa with a dark face, his fingers incessantly tapping the armrest.

Who upset him?

Seeing Aron's dark expression, I instinctively wanted to withdraw the natural magic.

As the thought arose, Aron glanced casually towards the pothos.

Instead, I felt justified staying put without moving.

What are you being fierce about?

Let me see, who provoked you?

Maria was awkwardly maneuvering through the crowd, trying to stop their discussion.

But clearly, it wasn't very effective.

Maria's good friend Claire completely ignored her attempts to change the subject, instead speaking even more vigorously.

Carried away by her excitement, she couldn't help sneering a few times.

Such a petty, vile demeanor.

Damn.

Claire, that bitch. When I first returned to the Lopez Family, she looked down on me as a country bumpkin with no manners and gave me a hard time multiple times.

I was just back then, completely timid and shy.

Once, she and her lackeys tricked me into being locked in the barn behind the school.

I leaned helplessly against the wall, crying until exhausted and fainting. Luckily, a kind person found me, rescued me, and sent me to the infirmary.

When I woke up and saw Katherine sleeping beside the hospital bed guarding me, I wasn't afraid anymore.

Later, perhaps because Claire had a guilty conscience, she ran away herself. I never saw her at school again. Heard from classmates she transferred to her mother's Pack school.

Until a few years ago, after coming of age, she got engaged to her childhood neighbor's son and moved back.

My mind wandered. Aron looked up, and the previously warm fireplace instantly extinguished.

Everyone fell silent.

The adults at the round table noticed the change, glanced towards the sofa, but seeing it was nothing major, just children squabbling, continued their conversation.

""Claire, you are very noisy.""

""Aron...""

Publicly reprimanded, Claire felt unable to back down and cast a pleading look towards Maria.

Owing to friendship, Maria stepped forward, trying to calm this dispute.

But Aron didn't give her face, raised his hand to signal her not to interfere, and continued looking at Claire with icy eyes.

""Claire, I recall your parents are merely Gammas. Who gives you the confidence to dare gossip about a Beta's daughter?""

1p5hwce,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/1p5hwce/my_tcf_canada_timeline/,My TCF Canada Timeline,"Hello,

I finished my TCF Canada for 7 months starting from 0. 
In the beginning, I was lucky to get referred to a teacher who understands pretty well TCF Canada and what the examiners are looking for. 
- March - June 2025: studied all foundation and necessary grammaire used in TCF Can. Spent 4 sessions/ week with the teacher and studied all day by myself and focused on her homework

- June to October 2025: focused on practicing and learned strategies for Speaking and Writing. She told me to do Reading and Listening by myself at home following by her materials. All the structures are well written down and summarized. All the Speaking and Writing are combined under different topics to ensure that I can mix match the structures more efficiently within the same topic

I believe TCF Can is the easiest test I have ever taken in my life. You need a good strategy, not real skills.

I cannot even order coffee in French but got 13 in Speaking and 14 in Writing. But I spent all day and night to study for it. Good luck everyone!

1p5hvaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1p5hvaa/a_realistic_morning_routine_that_doesnt_require/,A realistic morning routine that doesn't require waking up at 5am (finally something doable),"I used to think I needed a 2-hour morning routine with meditation, journaling, cold showers, and green juice to be successful.

Then I'd quit after 3 days because it was exhausting.

Here's the morning routine I actually stuck with for over a year. It takes 20 minutes and doesn't feel like a chore.

First 5 minutes: Wake up and hydrate. Keep water by your bed. Drink it before touching your phone. That's it. Your body is dehydrated and scrolling first thing crashes your dopamine. Start with water, not stress.

Next 5 minutes: Move a little. Not a full workout. Just stretch, do some jumping jacks, or walk around your place. Get your blood flowing. I do like 10 push-ups and stretch my back. Wakes me up better than coffee.

Next 5 minutes: Eat something real. Doesn't have to be fancy. Eggs, banana with peanut butter, yogurt. Just protein and not sugar. I used to skip breakfast and wonder why I crashed at 11am. Also no sugar also makes your energy levels higher.

Last 5 minutes: Plan your top 3. Write down the 3 most important things you need to do today. Not 10 things. Three. This stops you from feeling overwhelmed before the day even starts.

Optional: Make your bed Takes 30 seconds. Gives you a tiny win before you leave the house. Sounds stupid but it actually sets the tone.

That's it. 20 minutes. No ice baths, no hour-long meditations, no perfect Instagram aesthetic.

The trick isn't having the perfect routine. It's having one you'll actually do when you're tired, stressed, or running late.

Start tomorrow. Water, move, eat, plan. See how different your days feel.

If this is harder then take a 5 minute walk everyday. That's it. Just take walks everyday and you'll naturally want to do more overtime.",2,1763993018.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

# Identifying Your Keurig Model

Identifying your Keurig model is the first step to using it correctly. Each model has unique features and functions. Knowing your model helps you follow the right instructions and troubleshoot issues easily. It also ensures you use compatible accessories and pods.

Finding your Keurig model is simple. Check specific spots on the machine and use available resources. This guide shows easy ways to identify your Keurig model quickly.

# Checking Labels And Stickers

Look for labels or stickers on your Keurig. They are usually at the back or bottom. The label shows the model number and other details. Write down the model number for easy reference. This step helps confirm the exact model you own.

# Inspecting Water Reservoir And Drip Tray

Different Keurig models have unique water reservoir shapes. Check the size and placement of your water tank. Look at the drip tray design and size. These parts can give clues about your model. Compare these features with images online to narrow down your model.

# Using Owner’s Manual And Packaging

Find the owner’s manual that came with your Keurig. The manual states the model name clearly. Packaging boxes also list the model on the label. Keep these documents for future reference. They help you identify and use your machine properly.

# Searching Online With Serial Number

Locate the serial number on the machine’s label. Visit the Keurig website and enter the serial number. The site will display your model information. This method gives accurate results fast. Use the serial number to confirm your Keurig model anytime.

# Preparing The Machine

Preparing your Keurig coffee machine is the first step to enjoy a fresh cup of coffee. It involves setting up the machine properly to ensure smooth operation. Follow these simple steps to get your Keurig ready quickly and easily.

# Filling The Water Reservoir

Start by locating the water reservoir on your Keurig. Remove it carefully from the machine. Fill the reservoir with fresh, cold water. Do not overfill beyond the maximum fill line. Place the reservoir back securely into the machine. Clean water is key for great coffee flavor.

# Powering On The Machine

Next, plug your Keurig into a power outlet. Press the power button to turn the machine on. Wait for the machine to heat up. This usually takes a few minutes. You will see a light or display indicating it is ready. Never skip this step for a perfect brew.

# Selecting The Right K-cup Pod

Choose a K-Cup pod that suits your taste. There are many flavors and strengths available. Open the K-Cup holder on the machine. Place the pod inside with the foil side up. Close the holder firmly to pierce the pod. The right pod ensures a delicious cup every time.

# Brewing Coffee

Brewing coffee with a Keurig machine is quick and simple. The process uses K-Cup pods, which come in many flavors. You can easily adjust the brew size and strength to match your taste. Follow the steps below to enjoy a fresh cup every time.

# Inserting The K-cup Pod

Lift the handle on the Keurig to open the pod holder. Place your K-Cup pod in the holder. Make sure the foil side is facing up. Close the handle firmly to secure the pod in place.

# Choosing Brew Size And Strength

Look at the control panel on your machine. Select the cup size you want to brew. Most Keurig models offer small, medium, and large sizes. Adjust the strength setting if your machine has one. This controls how strong or mild your coffee will taste.

# Starting The Brew Cycle

Press the brew button to start the machine. The water will heat and pass through the K-Cup pod. Wait a few moments while coffee fills your cup. The machine will stop automatically once brewing finishes. Remove your cup carefully and enjoy your coffee.

# Adjusting Settings

Adjusting the settings on your Keurig coffee machine helps you make the perfect cup every time. You can change temperature, strength, and cup size. This section explains how to customize these options easily. It also covers using memory features for quick brewing.

# Temperature Controls

Most Keurig models let you set the water temperature. You can choose hotter or cooler water based on your taste. To change the temperature, press the temperature button on the machine. Then select the desired level. Warmer water brings out stronger flavors. Cooler water is good for delicate teas.

# Strength And Brew Size Options

You can adjust the coffee strength by selecting light, medium, or strong. Stronger settings use more coffee per cup. For brew size, Keurig offers several cup sizes. These usually range from 6 to 12 ounces. Choose a smaller size for a quick espresso-like shot. Pick a larger size for a full mug. Simply press the strength or size button before brewing.

# Using Memory And Custom Settings

Some Keurig machines save your favorite settings. Use the memory function to store your preferred strength and size. This saves time for future brews. To set memory, adjust your settings and hold the memory button until it beeps. Next time you brew, press the memory button to use saved preferences. This makes your coffee routine faster and easier.

# Cleaning And Maintenance

Keeping your Keurig coffee machine clean is key to great tasting coffee. Regular cleaning and maintenance help your machine last longer. It also prevents buildup that can affect performance. Follow simple steps to keep your Keurig in top shape.

# Descaling The Machine

Descaling removes mineral deposits inside your Keurig. These build up from water and can clog the machine. Use a descaling solution or white vinegar. Fill the water reservoir with the solution. Run brewing cycles without a K-Cup until the reservoir is empty. Then, run two or three cycles with clean water. This rinses out any leftover solution. Descale every three to six months for best results.

# Cleaning Removable Parts

Remove and wash parts like the drip tray and K-Cup holder. Use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth. Rinse well and dry before putting them back. Clean these parts weekly to avoid coffee stains and odor. Wipe the machine’s outside with a damp cloth too. Avoid using harsh cleaners that can damage surfaces.

1p5hr9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belize/comments/1p5hr9o/recommending_oscar_if_you_need_a_driver_in_belize/,Recommending Oscar if you need a driver in Belize,"My partner and I were recently in Belize for 9 days in November 2025 and used Oscar as a driver (@BelizeRoadRunner). He was amazing. He picked us up from the airport with snacks and drinks and drove us to our hotel in San Ignacio. Then a couple days later his brother drove us to our Hotel in Hopkins. Oscar had a conflict that day so arranged for his brother to drive us who was equally great. He also offered to stop to see sites along the way which we had planned to do but unfortunately it was raining the entire drive. Lastly, Oscar picked us up in Hopkins and drove us to the ferry port in Belize  City. Oscar is very professional, communicative and friendly. He always made sure we were comfortable and would always offer to stop for coffee or food along the way. We had a tour planned our second day and were unsure what time we were getting picked up. Oscar knew the tour company so called on our drive from the airport to confirm the plans with them which we really appreciated.

Oscar’s prices worked out cheaper for us than renting a car and gas cost, and was comparable if not cheaper than hotel transfers since it was only the two of us.

Hi my name is Audie Torres but “aud” works just fine, I’m about 5’11” with a lean and athletic build. In high school I was the star point guard of my school’s basketball team, but I wasn’t just your typical sporty jock, I was also a really huge nerd when it came to learning (yes I had high IQ both on the court and in the classroom), Now in college I’m already a 4th year dental student, as for my hoop career, before deciding for college I already accepted that it peaked in high school because I didn’t receive a playing offer from any major universities beforehand. Thankfully I’m smart enough to choose a degree rather than betting all my eggs at basketball.

Luckily at dental school I met a fellow hoop junkie, my best friend, Lewis Sanchez. But unlike me, he could have both a degree and a career at basketball. He was one of the top prospects in high school basketball in the Philippines and received multiple offers from other schools, given that he stood at 6’5” with a defined muscular and athletic build, and the shooting guard/small forward game to back it up (In my opinion, he never really looked right being a dentist lol), he chose the same college as me because it was the only college university that had a dental program. 

When we met in our first year we instantly hit it off especially when we played basketball against our seniors (In my high school I never played with a guy as talented as him, which made playing point guard so easier), it also helped that we were both good looking tall individuals who loved aura farming the ladies (Especially in a program like dentistry where the ratio is 80% females and 20% males). I was also present when he played against the other universities, and after his games I would critique him about how he played (He respected my basketball IQ enough to accept it). We were like brothers, inseparable, even in school when I struggle in anatomy he teaches me and I return the favor in biological chemistry.

While surviving dental school we also met the beautiful and kind Leah Quebec, who would soon make Lewis fall for her (with a little help from me of course). I loved Leah like a sister and as partner for my best friend, but it annoyed me when she often tried to make me commit to a single girl (not happening I was still enjoying my young adult life). At the start, the two were like a match made in heaven, and I was the angel who banded them together. But as the years went by, God proved otherwise that I made a terrible mistake getting them together.

Over our years together I got to know both of them dearly as my closest friends (yes all the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of them). The gist was that Leah was too passive and un-confrontational, she neglected to talk about heavy feelings in the relationship and acted always on her own, Lewis on the other hand was really toxic and emotionally unstable, having an ego that constantly needed appraisal, not to mention he was also verbally abusive to Leah, calling her different degrading names when they were having tension in the relationship. This started the cycle of them being on and off and me being in the middle when they fight fully knowing that they’re just opposite people who can’t change for each other. I comfort Leah about Lewis definitely needing to change and that she doesn’t deserve a man like that (I’ve known Lewis a long time, and am 100% sure he will never change), while at the same time, endlessly begging Lewis to change for Leah stating that even though she’s very uncommunicative and insensitive at times he should have some restraint on what he says to her (I could finish this story only with all the things I said to them over the years and talking about how toxic they are to project their personal unhealed traumas to one another lol, but don’t worry you’ll get to know them more as the story progresses).

Now this is where the story truly begins, after years of being caught at the middle of endless fights, Leah finally did it, she broke up and cut ties with him permanently for her own peace, but over the course of them being apart she was still relapsing from time to time because she still loved him, me knowing this relationship better than them and care more for both their well being at this point, I guiltily played the devils advocate and chose to gas light both of them about their love for each other, Leah took it better as usual and chose to heal on her own, but I was still left with an emotional reck of a best friend, He asked for company in going to a club for drinks and for him to try and get his mind off Leah, so we enjoyed the night partying, drinking, and flirting with women, until it was about 3am when I had to drag Lewis and all 6’5” of him out of there because he had a big game the following day against a rival university, but I had to sober him up first or he might just puke in the car, I dragged him barely standing up through countless alleys (I was screaming in my head, “where the fuck are all the 711’s when you need them!”). I was tired from dragging his drunk ass, so we sat at the curb of a street, where he was still half drunk talking about how he missed Leah, to which I replied, “You made out with five hoes tonight Lew, five!” he playfully rebutted saying “You’re getting soft brother, are you mad that only managed four hoes tonight?”. We both ended up laughing as I punched the side of his head saying “that was not the point you big idiot!”. Just then I barely saw a tiny cafe that was open this late at night. I told Lewis and thankfully he had regained some strength to stand on his own and walk to the cafe.

As we make our way inside the cafe we were greeted by the barista welcoming us by saying “what can I do for you guys tonight?”, Lewis’s half drunk mouth immediately replied, “can you get me a new girlfriend, preferably not on the crazy side”, the barista just laughed and said “sorry thats not on our specials today sir” and I joined in saying “I’m sorry for this big drunk idiot sir, could we just have some of your house blended coffee to sober up?”, The barista happily noded his head and began brewing.

The following conversation took place as we were waiting for our coffee:

Lewis: Bro I’m sorry about how me and Leah have been such a pain in your ass for years

Me: Its cool man, I’ve known you longer than Leah, I’m just surprised she lasted this long after encountering your consistent anger issues.

Lewis: Come one man, it’s not never ending, I only flare up when she just ignores me and starts being nonchalant.

(*Bartender proceeds to listen while making our coffee*)

Me: Thats just who she is dude, but you trash-talking her like when you’re hooping doesn’t help the problem. And to be fair bro you do affect all of us around you when you get mad, you can’t handle your emotions well even on the court, it just so happened that I know the real you well enough to dismiss it and say it to your stupid face.

Lewis: Sorry man, thanks for being a real one. I wish Leah could have been more like you. I think thats what I need in a woman, someone who can guide my decisions and assertive enough to call me out and explain what I should do to get better as a person.

Me: You do realize you’re describing either a mother or a point guard for a hooper’s pov?

Lewis: I’m not one of those guys that have a mom fetish but maybe I can find a nice point guard like you sooner or later.

Me: Thats so gay bro stfu.

Lewis: I’m just saying bro that theoretically you’ve seen all sides of me and lasted from all of the good to the bad, and if the latest iPhone could air drop that experience and ability to a woman I would buy it immediately.

Me: Still gay dude, stop it even if it’s true.

Lewis: Remember when I used the snapchat filter that made you look like a girl. You resembled your mom so much, and she’s hot! Even when I sent it to my teammates they asked for your socials!  

Me: bro come on, if you seriously weren’t drunk right now I’d punch you. 

Lewis: And thats why, you get me enough to not be sensitive cause you know I’m just messing with you!

Me: Yes, now can we finally stop with all the gayness and change the topic to something else, like which of those hoes did you enjoy feeling up the most dude? 

Lewis: Oh yeah bro! I mean Leah had great curves and all, but I think I prefer my next one to be a somewhat similar body type to those hoes we felt up.

Me: Alright then lets build your ideal girl’s body

(*Bartender proceeds to listen more closely as he’s getting ready to serve our coffee*)

Lewis: Lets see, I think Leah’s height was quite my ideal because I was able to lift her around while doing her,  but maybe a little bit taller and long legged so when she arches, her pussy is just the exact height for me.

Me: You gotta chill bro! That’s still Leah we’re objectifying hahahaha.

Lewis: Nahh bro I’m pulling out all the stops, next for body shape, I want her to have a normal healthy version of Kendall Jenner’s slim and sexy body type with the ass and curves so she doesn’t look like a starving model. Yeah! and for the boobs, I’ll be honest I like them big but not too big.

Me: Leah also failed you there I presume?

Lewis: Yeah, she could never really fully embrace my dick with her pair and coudn’t grab on to them when doing her. So maybe I’ll go with anything in between a C and D cup, those would look plenty big enough for a slim model body and my dick would still look big even while they’re sandwiched between.

Me: Looks like I wasn’t the only one into anime girls as a kid! She would look so hot!

Lewis: Yeah bro! Then we just transfer your attitude to her!

Me: You’ve been so gay tonight buddy, anyway here comes our coffee.

Barista: Sorry for wait gentlemen, here are your comet cups.

Me and Lewis: Why are they called comet cups?

Barista: Because like a comet, you make a wish the first time you see or experience it. Or at least that’s thats the cringey line I like to tell our drunk customers.

Me and Lewis proceeded to do it anyway. Thinking of my friend, all I wished at that moments was for him to finally receive the girl meant for him. I then sipped the coffee which had a delightful taste and within seconds of sipping I didn’t feel the alcohol anymore, instead I felt the rush of caffeine, maybe a little too much? I started to get dizzy with palpitating, everything spinning and getting fuzzy as I glanced over at the barista and then to Lewis, I could tell he was feeling the same, and we both blacked out and fell to the floor…

As I awoke to the smell of morning breeze, I’m in my bed thinking that everything was just a dream. But I felt heavy when breathing, like something was sitting on my chest, I immediately sit up on my bed and felt its weight move but it was still attached to me. Moreover I felt my hair slide at the back of my neck which confused me since I know I just got a haircut last week. I then looked around as my eyes widened, “this is my room! but what happened to it?!” all the furniture I recognize were all in place and the positions I like, but why the hell was the room full of girly shit? I got up and rushed immediately to the restroom to wash my face figuring I was still in a dream. Upon reaching the mirror though I saw, well, me! But not completely me! The girl version of me!

The problem is the **window height**. The bottom of the window is **97 cm (38"")**, so a regular table feels too low to actually enjoy the view.

It’s just two of us living here. We rarely have more than 6 people over. My parents are older, so having *only* a bar + an island might not be ideal for them… but having a **bar + table + island** feels like too much for the space.

I have a Breville Bambino Plus (refurbished, received last month) and I'm using the Melitta Calibra grinder.

**Original Issue:**
The machine initially had the flashing clean lights. I ran a backflush clean on Saturday night, which fixed the flashing, and I had perfect shots all day Sunday.

**Current Problem (Started this morning):**
* **With an empty portafilter (or no portafilter):** Water flows normally from the group head.
* **With a tamped coffee puck:** Absolutely **zero water** comes out of the portafilter spout. The pump engages and sounds normal, but all the water is being redirected back into the drip tray (via the Over-Pressure Valve/solenoid valve).

**What I have tried already:**
* Ensured the water tank is full and firmly seated.
* Attempted to run the hot water function.
* Confirmed the pump is working (water flows with no resistance).

My current suspicion is that the backflush either dislodged a piece of scale that is now blocking the fine exit hole in the **pressurized basket**, OR the **OPV** is now stuck or opening at too low a pressure.

Any suggestions on how to diagnose which of these is the issue would be greatly appreciated!",3,1763992546.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

Newbie here [$1000 budget],"I currently use a Nespresso Vertuo as my everyday coffee but I mainly enjoy Lattes and Cappuccinos from cafes. I have always wanted to make espresso at home but the rabbit hole always leads me to need to spend $1000s on a machine plus grinder plus scale ect. 

I saw a post about a Ninja and it peaked my interest but after doing a little research it is lacking in the espresso quality but the all in one feature is appealing. This led me to the De'Longhi La Specialista Maestro which has some all in one features but is also more manual and leaps better quality than the Ninja.

I’m not looking to make the best coffee in the world but would love a damn good cup without having ALL the mad scientist steps involved.

My question is down the line is there any reason I would need to ditch the De'Longhi La Specialista Maestro due to things I can’t foresee now because I am still very new?

Thank you for any insight/advice!

I liked him since the day I met him and he admitted that he liked me since then as well. At that time we talked a bit and after a while he ghosted me. After a few months I found out he had a girlfriend and I brushed off the ghosting, thinking he probably doesn’t want to act on anything since he’s in a relationship. A year later he messages me again and blocks me after a few days. This happened one more tine until new years eve 2023/24. We saw each other at a bar after a long time, he texted me and we went out the same night. We talked and he said that his girlfriend kept blocking me from his phone since she knew he had a crush on me. After that day we talked for a few more days and later he told me he just got out of a long term relationship and doesn’t want to disappoint me. We stop talking until last winter when he messaged me apologizing for that previous conversation but I was in another country at the time and we knew nothing’s going to happen. Ghosted again. I was supposed to come on vacation this summer and we were talking again around that time and agreed to meet up for coffee when I’m back. As you can guess, he ghosted me when I came back. I went away again and came back for good two months ago. He saw me randomly one day and messaged me asking if I’m staying here and somehow managed to get me to go out with him again even though I was angry with him. We went out and he gave me a (in my opinion) lame excuse that it would be too hard for him to see me then just for me to leave again and promised that he won’t to that to me anymore since I’m staying here. Couple days went by and I didn’t hear anything from him so I sent a simple hey, but the message was stuck on “sent” even though he was active and I think he restricted my messages. I know the obvious answer is for me to block him on everything and move on but somehow something is pulling me towards him and I’m very confused on what to do.

All the powers of modern commerce have entered into a holy alliance to proclaim it: the CEOs, the retailers, the distant factories of the East.

I looked upon the tattered remains of my once-washed Dropout garments, and I was astonished. For I had believed, in the naïveté common to those who love an art, that such relics of joy and laughter would be wrought by the hands of local labor…perhaps even by American workers themselves. Yet when the parcel arrived, it bore the unmistakable mark of Chinese manufacture, emblem of the global supply chain that binds all creators, great and small, to the inexorable logic of capital.

And though I am no great collector of merchandise, my tokens of devotion are usually seized in the clamorous halls of concerts, I had placed my faith in Dropout, thinking them perhaps exempt from the typical machinations of bourgeois production. 

But no: CEOs are CEOs, and no company, however beloved its on-camera talent, stands outside the iron laws of profit and cost. The real late stage capitalism is that of the capitulation of BLeeM, having anti-capitalism quotes mass-printed on T-shirts and coffee mugs from China. How ironic.

Still, comrades, let it be known: I remain eager for my next Game Changer shirt (the fifteenth to eventually die in my dryer) to arrive in the next six to eight months. For even within the engine of capitalism, the workers and watchers unite in joy; and it is with full knowledge of the system’s contradictions that I don the garment, a humble symbol of the world as it is…and the world as it might yet become.

The city itself is incredibly diverse and has a rich history incorporating Spanish, French, Creole, Cajun, American, Vietnamese, and other diasporic influences affecting food, architecture, language, art, migration pattern, population distribution, politics, etc. You could have ghouls desperately holding onto their Antebellum lineage and run into a faction descending from Creole people next to another faction descended from the Vietnamese enclave of the Westbank (did the Vietnam War even happen in Fallouts alternate history?). 

There's also an active military base nearby! Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans as well as the Jackson Barracks which is a National Guard facility. 

Oil runs through the city like water. What happens to the massive energy industry of New Orleans in an atompunk world? 

There is so much to play with in regards to local flora and fauna. Gators, egrets, herons, nutria, turtles, cypress trees, etc. But also the ecosystem has lots of creatures that are not native to the area. There's a history of illegal pet smuggling and zoos freeing their animals during times of emergency. For example, when I lived in New Orleans, I was having coffee on my porch and looked up to see a macaw which is native to South America. What happens if a sympathetic zoo keeper frees all the animals at Audubon Zoo when news of the bombs drop hits? A centaur created from a bengal tiger, gator, and blackbear? 

There's also massive local superstitions and legends to draw from. The ""Lougarou"" is a Cajun werewolf legend from Southern Louisiana. There's a strong voodoo culture in New Orleans. Strong pagan and witch culture. There's an entire industry around ghost tours. 

I could go on and on and on but New Orleans and the surrounding area provides a feast of worldbuilding for a new Fallout game.

*Your walking along a beach, it seems to almost be scenic as you push on towards one of 007n7's manors out here.*

*You begin to notice... bad things as you approach via the small road through a treeline...*

*At first, you notice simply a few abandoned pieces of Team C00lkid hardware such as helmets, kneepads and even some GUI panels or weaponry however... they all seem damaged, damaged beyond repair and as you continue walking things become more disturbing.*

*Simple equipment start becoming body parts and abandoned vehicles, stained with the blood of former occupants and damaged just as much as the equipment.*

*And then.. you stumbled across one of them.. a member of Team C00lkid or what remains of him... his leg has been blown off as well as his stomach, his intestines and even spine sticking out from where his stomach is meant to be... his head is half blown off as on his mask, a look of pure terror is left on the half that is still remaining.*

*You keep moving on as on the abandoned vehicles and stuck in the nearby trees, the dead bodies of TCK members lay, their blood splattered all across as they've clearly been ripped apart, some body parts and organs simply laying about.*

*As you enter into the clearing towards the manor, you see something almost shocking.. sickening..*

*Hundreds of bodies and vehicles lay in the field ahead, bodies of the TCK as several vehicles, tanks, Humvees, trucks and even simple civilian cars burn inbetween as the defences, seemingly put up in a rush for something, had been dismantled and destroyed.*

*Just before reaching the gate, you notice something... It's a TCK member.. still alive as he writes something on the wall of the manor with a red substance.. his blood.*

*As he finishes, his head slightly turns to you as he notices you... his right eye is hanging out of it's socket, practically carved out as he drops to the floor behind himself, completely bleeding out into the grass as you look in terror to see what he had written..*

*You walk forward.. the blood stained roses seemingly popping with colour as you near the front door, the body of a TCK commander slumped up against it.*

*You open the door, the body dropping backward as you walk inside... the air is stale and reeks of death as just infront of you, on the wall, another message is written in blood.*

*The body of the writer, torn into two pieces seemingly laying underneath it.*

To anyone else listening to this, I don't know what encouraged you to come here in my final moments but stand assured, I likely die here so be still and leave me to die in a hell of my own making...”***

***“... Finally, to my beautiful wife Baker and my family.. I'm Sorry for not being there for you all, every one of you deserves so much better than a father like me because no matter how much I try to change, I don't think I ever can. If you find me, please, don't be sad, be happy, be happy that an evil man has been wiped off this earth.”***

*He is stuck to the wall, impaled onto it by a flag of the TCK.. drenched in his blood..*

*He stays almost lifeless as the only thing you can hear in the room are the sounds of your own breaths and his..*

*He's still alive but bearly, clinging on as blood leaks from his mouth, dripping onto the flag pole impaled through his chest as he attempts to look upwards.*

*He knows who you are as he once again bows his head, the purplish glasses he always wears now falling off his face and to the floor, shattering with a loud crack.*

*Tears slowly fall from his eyes as blood continues to leak from his mouth, him seemingly gripping something tightly in either hand.*

*You take a closer look to his left hand and it's simply a piece of paper, likely containing the information he promised Carepad however his right hand is closed tighter, clearly protecting something important as you finally notice something in it through a small gap...*

1p5hb6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcAbuseAndDivorce/comments/1p5hb6r/need_to_update_child_arrangement_order_with/,"Need to update child arrangement order with narcissist deadbeat - is it worth the hassle? I’m in England, dad in Scotland.","
For context - I have (11f) and (9m). I left in 2017 when daughter was 2.5 and son 11 months. We were living in Scotland where their dad is from (isolated me), I moved back to my hometown in southern England to be close to friends and family for support, and for my mental health. I have brought my kids up alone and they are bright, well-rounded, and want for nothing, even though I am very limited financially. He pays nothing. 

Their father is a narc sociopath, typical back story of love bombing, married him quickly, then his mask came off. Lots of emotional and mental abuse, financial abuse, occasional physical abuse. He is highly intelligent and manipulative and always manages to back me into a corner and make me look bad, but come out golden himself. I don’t know how he does it. 

He quit work (good job as a manager) when I got pregnant with our daughter, hasn’t contributed a penny since. CMS can’t do anything as he has purposely gone into rent arrears so he doesn’t have to pay ‘me’. (Rent arrears are taken from his benefits over maintenance). My own promising career stalled, and I have been in various part time jobs that work around the kids ever since. Stuck in the benefits system. I have always worked as much as possible, because I want to model that for my kids, rather than his lazy entitledness. 

He took me to court in 2018, dragged my name through the mud, tried to throw all sorts of shit at me to see what stuck. Judge didn’t consider my abuse claims, as he was accusing me of the same. Order is barely worth the paper it’s written on, just states that he needed to hand over their passports to me at the time, I am the primary parent, and visits are to take place in school holidays due to the distance.

My issue is, the drop off point is stated in black and white on the order. It’s halfway up the country, a 250 mile drive for both parties, both ways. And a very long trip for the kids. I have made this work for 9 years. I take days off work to drive them up, to pick them up, £££ on petrol, wear and tear on my car, coffees and snacks for the journey etc. It’s gruelling and traumatic. 

All I want is to get that line, with the drop off point, removed from the court order, so the onus is on him to visit/collect his kids, rather than me having to facilitate the huge ordeal. 

It also makes me highly anxious. I am not an anxious person but there is a build up and come down for me and the kids around the visits. I have fought for a PTSD diagnosis for years, finally have one, and finally persuaded doctors to write me a recommendation for legal aid - you have to ‘prove’ the abuse to receive it in England. In Scotland he will receive legal aid easily as on benefits. I *could* beg/steal/borrow money for a solicitor, but this plays in to the financial abuse. I have always paid for EVERYTHING - the wedding, divorce, cars, bills, food, rent, everything!! And it makes me feel like shit to spend more hard-earned money on his nonsense. I need the validation from doctors and government that holds him accountable. For my sanity. 

A few years ago, he lost his driving licence. I don’t speak to him much at all, and he would never give me a straight answer as to why, but I highly suspect it’s to do with the amount of opioid painkillers he’s on. A doctor can revoke a licence for this. He claims depression, broken shoulder, crohn’s disease (all his own doing, getting in fights and terrible diet). He milks and manipulates doctors to gain sympathy and painkillers. I can’t prove this, or any of the abuse really. He is far too gaslighting, clever and sneaky to leave evidence. Therefore, his elderly parents, or scapegoated sister, has been doing drop offs/pick ups for him. I feel terrible for them having to do it. But also relieved he is not driving the kids around any more with no seatbelts, sharing a car seat, sitting in the back of a van, and/or having major roadrage and driving recklessly (daughter is traumatised by him being ‘on 2 wheels’ once when travelling). 

He has visited only 3 or 4 times in 9 years, the last visit being early 2020. He forgets their birthdays. He bad mouths me and my family to the kids when he has them. He encourages bad and cruel behaviour. He does no actual parenting, leaves everything up to his mum on visits. 

My daughter no longer wants to visit, and I’m not going to force her, she gets very upset, she has seen right through him. Therefore I am in contempt of court for her not going. My son has rose-tinted glasses and somewhat idolises his dad. Wants to visit more often, and for longer. He is aware (age-appropriately) that his dad could do more, pay more, and more trips aren’t viable unless his dad facilitates. I never bad mouth him, but I am honest when I need to be. 

The Christmas visit is looming, and I would love to say that due to my work rota, I cannot drop off or pick up the kids. This is partly true as my schedule at xmas is hectic, and I also need to do the journey twice in a week (aswell as a separate family visit up north), when the motorways are like car parks that time of year. My car has overheated before doing it, and has also warned me I’ve been driving too long (12 hours straight one time). It is unsafe. I know I will cave and take/pick up to save his parents or sister doing it, but I hate being manipulated into this, so much. 

So… do I… 

A) use my legal aid, start proceedings and drag us through court with very little evidence? Cafcass will interview the kids. Daughter understands what she will have to do and is quite up for it! Son will defend his dad. BUT this runs a real risk of a judge stating we carry on as we are - which would be a waste of time, effort and money. It will also be traumatic for me and the kids. I do however now have my PTSD diagnosis which might support me evidence wise. 

B) sit tight and wait for him to take me to court for contempt and breaking the agreement by daughter not going? Or for not taking them up at xmas? BUT this way it is always hanging over my head and making me anxious. 

C) Do I float the idea of not being able to drive them up over xmas? Start there and see what the reaction/comeback is? It’s so risky. Or do I break my neck with arrangements as usual? 

Thanks for reading. What would you do?

Since the beginning of our relationship we had a boundary of not talking about our exes or to our exes because of previous trauma/issues we both had in the past. They also did not want me to keep photographs of my exes and keep absolutely zero contact with them, they were very strict about this.

During the first years I found out they still messaged their ex for birthdays, I felt birthdays aren’t a serious offence but it’s the lying and holding me to different standards. A few years later, my spouse hired their exes siblings and cousins to work at our company and did not disclose they were all related until I discovered it out on my own. It was the lack of communication. I was told since I didn’t want to talk about our exes, they assumed I wouldn’t want to know the connection to their ex, I said no I would have preferred to know.

Now six years later I find out they ran into the same ex two years ago and had coffee with them, talked for quite a long time and discussed a lot of personal details of both their lives. I was told again because of an old boundary of not wanting to hear about exes, they didn’t tell me for my own sake. I said again, I would have preferred to know and that when we made the rule of hearing about our exes it was that we didn’t want to hear the other person go on and on about their previous relationships, not that I wouldn’t want to know if they actually bumped into one another.

Anyways, officially done with the stupid boundary of not talking about exes but how can I stop feeling insecure over something that happened two years ago that isn’t important but feels like a betrayal? Am I over reacting that this is hurtful? I feel like this ex will always be an issue and now I don’t trust my partner.",1,1763991552.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1p5halb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p5halb,"🍫 35-Cal Chocolate Banana Cake (556 kcal total - 16 slices) Low-Cal, Moist, Fudgy, and Delicious!","Hey everyone! I wanted to share a low-cal chocolate cake recipe that I’ve been working on for a while.

When I first got into low-calorie baking, I tried several recipes online… and honestly, I was disappointed a few times, mostly because erythritol amounts were way too high, which affects both texture and taste.

After some trial and error, I found the best combo is to use lower amounts of erythritol + a few drops of liquid stevia and taste the batter before baking to adjust sweetness.

I’ve made this recipe multiple times now and it’s delicious, low-cal, and definitely satisfies sweet cravings.

Ingredients (calories are per amount needed)

	•	2 medium eggs → 136 kcal
	•	35 g egg whites → 18 kcal
	•	80 g banana (mashed) → 72 kcal
	•	85 g thick yogurt → 55 kcal
	•	38 g flour → 138 kcal
	•	30 g unsweetened cocoa powder → 114 kcal
	•	5 g cornstarch → 18 kcal
	•	4.5 g baking powder → 5 kcal
	•	30 g erythritol + liquid stevia to taste → 0 kcal
	•	1/2 tsp instant coffee → 0 kcal
	•	Pinch of salt → 0 kcal
	•	A few drops vanilla extract or zero-calorie vanilla syrup → ~1 kcal

Instructions

Step 1 – Whip the eggs + sweeteners
	•	Crack 2 eggs into a bowl + 35 g egg white
	•	Mix 3–4 minutes with a hand mixer until pale and fluffy

Step 2 – Add wet ingredients
	•	Mix in yogurt, mashed banana, and vanilla extract

Step 3 – Add dry ingredients
	•	Sift in flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt
	•	Mix again

Step 4 – Add cocoa–coffee paste
	•	Mix 30 g cocoa powder + 1 tsp instant coffee + a little hot water into a paste
	•	Stir into the batter

Step 5 – Bake
	•	Pour into a 24–25 cm square pan (≈9.5–10 in)
	•	Bake at 180°C / 356°F for 12–14 min

Step 6 – Cool + Slice
	•	Let cool for minimum 30 min – 1 hour before slicing 
	•	Store in a container in the fridge (the cake tastes even better the next day!)

Optional: I usually add 1 teaspoon of low-cal cream cheese frosting I make (chocolate or vanilla, ~11 kcal per teaspoon) to each slice before eating as I wouldn’t recommend frosting the whole cake if you don’t plan to eat it all the same day. The cake is delicious cold, but you can also microwave a slice for 20 seconds before adding frosting for a slightly warm version.

I’ve added a few pictures of the whole process if you’re interested. I hope you enjoy if you try it ☺️

I know this because I saw her and she even said she was doing that. I didn't wanted to be rude because I realized that I cannot block her because we are not friends. But she still can come everyday and make me cook just for her almost 🙄

So, I changed the settings to not be able to interact with furniture. I'll leave it like that for a while. The truth is I enjoy sharing my island and the food dishes with other nikkis. But this is just troll behavior.

1p5h9ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1p5h9ht/the_twilight_zone_of_hell/,The twilight zone of hell,"This has been going on a decade. Just escalated 100x across the spectrum of intensity and how awful she treats me the last year and a half. September of last year she met the worst of her APs. Most intense most sexual most everything. I remember sitting in a state of shock as she was telling me how much she wanted to sleep with him, how attractive he is how he’s everything I’m not- and even more. Continued hiding him, but really also didn’t because any time I’d say something I’d literally get mocked with “gtf over it” or some variant. I remember asking to just come back and pick me because I know she’s having some bad mental health issues and she saying I pick him.

Well- come to find out after reading her journal September of this year, the affairs didn’t stop. There’s dozens and at least 5-10 new ones that were just as involved. Irrespective of what I do- her contempt and disdain for me grows when she’s talking to other men. She’ll bring the kids into her going off the rails against me speaking my name like poison. I’ll literally be fixing the drawer not talking and she’ll go out of her way to call me gross. Every single decent thing I have to fight for, argue for it’s never freely given apologies rarely happen- just a whole lot of “ I don’t ****ing care” and more - and when it is, I’m so exhausted from having to fight for it that it doesn’t even matter. 

Then she’ll have these little moments where she’s crying and sorry and oh here’s this list of names passcodes the whole 9 yards. She’s gone as far to say I’m symptomatic of a mental health disorder that I have when I’m on the trail of something- and when I bring up that I just met with my therapist once a week or psychiatrist she says stuff like “I don’t effing care what they think. They don’t live with you I see things they don’t.” I’ve been called crazy more times than I can count- and I know I’m hyper vigilant but even when I have literal proof she humiliated me openly, mocks me makes fun of me, blames me for everything says she’s way above my league, sexually shames me with her APs- and even in coupled counseling we just started (I’m highly hesitant) she sourced this professional because she has a speciality in substance abuse was an LMFT and some other stuff (I struggled with prescription benzos when I left the service, 20 months sobriety) but now is complaining that the therapist “clearly had a bias and more compassion for drug addicts and I don’t want go.” It’s like….my stuff is 20 months in the past and accountable across the board- her cheating to my knowledge and subsequent shaming and humiliation and screaming at me for everything is like 3 weeks old. Obviously a professional is going to go after the most current and immediate threat to the relationship, and it’s not anything on my end.

Married 11 years with 3 kiddos. Locking down and already speaking with an attorney. I don’t think there’s a therapist on the planet that can fix this. Developing exit plan subtly to avoid rocking the boat. My mental health is worse than all 8 years AD military- and I deployed 4 times and was in an armed capacity. I feel so fundamentally worthless and stupid- it is not hyperbole, but there is not one thing about my entire personhood, past, struggles, sexuality happiness, progress or anything else that woman has not gone after violently. She even busted my nose open this summer with her phone mad about me texting a female coworker about work schedules thinking I was cheating on her- despite her seeing my phone and all text messages. Which were just about work. 

I take ambien and she was following me around yelling about the texts that night and I just said I’m disengaging and sleeping on the couch. I laid down, was almost asleep- she came down stairs sat on my legs at my knees and was yelling tossing her phone at my face saying”go ahead check it”. Obviously I was disoriented I had taken my medications but I had the presence of mind to know that if I made any attempt to move and get away, and she fell off my legs and bumped anything let alone hit her elbow or something on the coffee table and go any kind of mark I was going to jail. So I sat there nose busted open bleeding all over myself with her still going. She eventually left. A couple weeks later 1st day on vacation on the hotel she thought I was asleep- I watched her as she went on snap, went to her camera roll, selected a picture of her and I on our last recent date night, cropped me entirely out of it- and sent just the picture of her to an AP.

Cropped me out of a date night picture and sent to another man. Perfect example of what is happening in my real world. It was the perfect encapsulation of my world. But now- over the last four weeks essentially there has been a come to Jesus moment on her end. Truthfully- I’m not interested. I’m just in so much pain I borderline can’t function. I mean using someone’s mental health to gaslight them, chronic blame, character, identity and sexual comparisons and attack and humiliation invalidating them as a person, a partner and parent, to include attempting to bring the kids into when she’s going off the rails against me and all things therein repeatedly, near daily- for most of the day even if we aren’t directly speaking she’s hunt me down just to insult me. Seriously guys- there’s not a single thing about me she hasn’t overtly gone after. And then the mental gymnastic she does of tying in things that are totally irrelevant outright not true when she’s going off.

I think at this point it’s just fear of being alone. I’ve talked with a lawyer the last year or so- I feel very confident in 50/50 custody if not more. Looking at alternate housing to support me and the kiddos, upgrading VA disability for more money and a new job with a pause on school to focus on maximizing income. I also am getting back into lifting, not quit the level of actual bodybuilding like I did before- but I miss the structure and discipline and being jacked. I’ve gotten tons of feedback on being highly emotionally, Intelligent, a good listener, leader- I’ve got crazy stories I’m a good person I just want that icing on the cake of peak physicality because I know I’m not ugly- and frankly I’m not saying long term relationship at all right now, but my sole relations and romantic input has been this ^ for a decade and I want the kindness and attraction and all that of a woman even if it’s just flirting or basic conversation. And I want to model to my kids that even under stress and pain you can still function and take care of business. And honestly- I need to get back to me, instead of stupidly putting all things in her. I loved training like that- I loved certain music, a cooking, and shooting and just being a lot more social than I have been suppressed (and also suppressed myself) into being. I think some days I’d rather get hit by a bus than feel this pain- but it’s not changing any time soon and it’s time for me to get back to my roots, and find some new ones",0,1763991455.0,survivinginfidelity,1,0.5,False
1p5h8u9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_rentacarherairport/comments/1p5h8u9/winter_in_crete/,Winter in Crete,"# To Crete or Not to Crete for Winter 2025?

(a.k.a. “Will I be sipping coffee by the sea or pushing my rental car up a mountain?”)

Okay, Reddit — major question here: Is Crete a winter destination or a winter gamble?

[Cretan-roads-in-winter](https://preview.redd.it/nyk1g1d7i73g1.jpg?width=1153&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67c4aa690124f9447eec92e224752a7fb6d89f90)

# 🌬️ The (Possibly Windy) Upsides



The coastal areas stay pretty mild — expect average daytime temps of \~15–17 °C so you might not need to trade in your shorts for a parka. 

Because tourist season is dead, everything feels way more authentic. Fewer crowds, more space, and more time to actually enjoy places like small villages and local tavernas. 

Renting a car in winter = cheaper. According to our experience and knowledge, daily rates drop a lot. 

Some days are sunny, and hidden gems (villages, cliffs, quiet beaches) are yours pretty much to yourself.



# ⚠️ Risks (Yes, Even in “Sunny” Crete)

Mountain roads suck in bad weather: In winter, higher altitude roads can get snow or ice. 

After rain, roads might be very slippery. Crete’s mountain asphalt isn’t always reliable. 

Watch out for rock falls. Heavy rain can trigger debris on rural roads. 

Animal hazard alert: Goats, sheep, and random farm animals love to chill (or charge) on mountain roads. 

Some roads are very narrow, especially in villages. You might need to give way, reverse, or be super chill while waiting for the other guy. 

GPS ≠ always reliable. Some remote or small roads might not show up or are misleading. 

Driving at night? Not ideal. Crete’s night roads are often poorly lit, and with narrow mountain lanes + wildlife… yeah. 

On some very cold days, ice or frost can make driving risky. The Greek Transport Ministry even advises using traction aids like tire chains when necessary. 

[Rainbow-winter-Crete](https://preview.redd.it/qnf9uf89i73g1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef042ad0872e131b272a3bcab50186668a1ca7ac)

# ✅ My Verdict ( For a Potential Winter Crete Tourist)

If you’re cool with taking it slow, want to explore beyond the beaches, and don’t mind a bit of risk — Crete in winter could be absolutely magical and super chill.

But if your mood is “beach, cocktails, sunbathing all day” — winter Crete may disappoint.

#  Crete is Perfect for Winter Holidays in the Sun

Crete in the winter is a hidden gem. The island’s mild climate allows for comfortable exploration, from strolling along quiet beaches to visiting picturesque villages and olive groves. Winter also brings a more authentic side of Crete, with welcoming locals and vibrant cultural traditions

Pro tip: [Rent a car in Crete](https://www.okaycrete.com/article/Winter-drives-in-Crete.html) (because public transport outside summer is not reliable for remote areas), check weather forecasts before any mountain trip, and don’t plan to drive super aggressively.

Who specifically do you talk to and what do you say to get them to agree? I have decent credit but rates around 20% or more even though I had like 750-780 when I opened them. The interest added each month makes the amount I can pay almost useless so I’m caught in a cycle. 

what I’m putting on cards isn’t exactly frivolous- out of pocket medical expenses, tax bills, utilities, gas, car repairs, vet bills/ pet meds, buying my kid secondhand clothing at the thrift store, buying stuff like batteries, replacing a lawnmower tire, things needed for diy home repair, (not upgrades- repairs and maintenance only) etc. 

we don’t have new fancy cars or buy coffee or avocado toast or any of the bs that people seem to love saying millennials waste their money on and make themselves poor. I do have student debt. 

We got lucky in buying a house young without any family type help. Things were gravy until 2020. I used to have savings, I used to have enough to put aside retirement money, our health insurance also used to actually cover stuff, which seems to be nonexistent today. 85% of our furniture is secondhand minus beds and the couch. We had to replace our roof, furnace and water heater 2 years ago- roof and furnace over 30 years old and water heater was about 13 years old  both not heating much. 

All of the necessities have gone up- property taxes, electric, water, gas, groceries, healthcare, vet visits, prescriptions, things we used to be able to afford with money to spare. Now it’s more than our income. So please spare me the “stop living beyond your means” because my 12 year old car, my secondhand furniture, our diy house and yard, clothes that don’t fit, and many months without a single mocha latte beg to differ.

This post if more of a vent or an off my chest kind of post, but if you have some advice for the situation then that is also very much appreciated! I am a man, but I love reading the posts in two x, and I have learned a lot from it. 
So about 5 years ago I (M36) started dating my current girlfriend (F33) who I live with now. She is amazing and I couldn’t be happier with her and the life we have built together. After we had been dating for only about 2 months, we went back to her place after a gig that I been playing in. Her friend (F33) who lives in another country was visiting her at the time and staying at my girlfriend’s place. My friend M(35) also came back to her place with me after the gig, and he was pretty drunk. We had all had a few but I hadn’t noticed how bad he was until we got back to hers. But I’ve known him since we were about 12 years old and he was my best friend, so I didn’t think too much of it. Anyway, at one point he went to the bathroom and didn’t come down for about 20 minutes, so I went to check on him. I guess maybe he had fallen asleep or something, but I got him to come back downstairs to us. We decided to end the night then, we let him sleep on the couch and myself and my girlfriend slept in her room, and her friend slept on an airbed. I really with we had just ordered a taxi for him due to what happened next.
So the next day when we got up, he had already left and it was just myself, my girlfriend and her friend that were left. I didn’t think much of it because we had gotten up pretty late. Then, a couple of days later, he decided to bring up that night again. He said that because the couch was so small and uncomfortable, that he had asked her friend if it would be ok if he slept in the same bed as her. At the time I thought it was a bit strange that he would ask someone that he doesn’t know if he could sleep in the same bed as her, and also I didn’t understand why he brought that up to me out of nowhere, just real casual like, you know just like kind mentioning it in passing, like a funny story. But due to what my girlfriend told me a couple of weeks later, I think that he did this in a calculating manner to try and get ahead of the situation. Keep in mind, he had and has a Fiancee that he has been with for well over 15 years.
So a week or so later, my girlfriend told me that her friend had informed her that after I left, my friend had tried to touch her inappropriately. To give you the details, he tried to put his hand down there. She brushed it away, and then he tried to do it again, but she moved it away a second time. I should also mention that there was a table between the couch and the airbed. I was shocked of course, but tbh he has always been the type of guy to get handsy with women when he gets drunk. It’s something that I’ve always noticed and never felt comfortable about. Nobody in my friend group ever talks about it though. So although it was a surprise to me that he had done something like this, it did make sense to me and of course I believed my girlfriend and her friend. My girlfriend also told me that he had also put his hand on her leg when I was not in the room at one point.
The way that I dealt with it at the time, was that I decided to confront him about it in person and try to see his side of the story. He played the victim in my opinion, like we talked for a long time about it, but when I left, my analysis was that his side of the story is that he doesn’t remember doing it, and that he doesn’t think that he did it, but that he is very sorry. That sounds pretty guilty to me. He would also say that the couch was just too small and that we didn’t give him a blanket, so he felt that he had to sleep in the air bed. That wasn’t the only time that I talked to him about it, because I wasn’t happy with the conversation, so I felt like I had to bring it up multiple times, but every time we talked about it, it was always the time. He never took responsibility in my opinion. He would say things like it isn’t his reality because he doesn’t remember, and that this whole thing has really affected his mental health and that he feels suicidal and stuff like that. He would say things like he wishes he could do something to fix it but he can’t do anything about it because he doesn’t remember doing it, or how would I like it if he told me that I had murdered someone the night before and I had no memory of it? That one is particularly infuriating to me, because in my mind that is a very different situation. But for years, I tried to kind of get past it and we would still hang out which I am not proud of tbh. I think of his gas lighting worked on me as well, like sometimes I really did feel like I fucked up by not giving him a blanket, which seems absurd to me now.
But he is very much apart of my friend group, so I guess I kind of took the path of least resistance and tried to act like everything was ok, I’m also very close to his fiancee, she is truly a great person and a very kind person.
Eventually, this year, I finally decided to break off my friendship with him because I just couldn’t handle the guild anymore, and I guess I also have a lot of anger towards him because of what he did. When I told him this, I felt like he still really didn’t respect my boundaries, and said stuff like let’s meet up for coffee to talk about it and he also said that he needs to tell me something that he’s never told anyone before, but I said no sorry, I’ve made my final decision and I don’t want to hear whatever it is that you have to say. Obviously I was curious about what he had to say, but I didn’t want my curiosity to get the better of me. Unfortunately, he did manage to tell me what it was because he managed to pull me aside at a mutual friend’s wedding for a chat. I probably should have just told him to get lost, but I let him talk to me about it because I guess the friendship still goes very deep and on some level I can’t help but want everything to go back to normal. I won’t tell you the details about what he wanted to tell me because it involves SA to him and is pretty graphic, but tbh I don’t think any of that matters to this story anyway, but there it is in case you are curious.
Anyway, it has been about 6 months now since I broke off the friendship with him, and I don’t regret my decision at all, I only wish that I did it sooner tbh, but I was weak and chose to keep him around for a while I guess. I always felt so guilty when his Fiancee was around because I had this secret you know? I think she deserves to know, but I don’t that it is my place to tell her that, but you guys can weigh in on that if you like. I guess I don’t want any part of this guys life anymore, but I’m not here to ruin his life if that makes sense.
One problem for me with the fallout of all of this is (to be clear I didn’t make my decision with any consequences to my own life in mind, it was purely a moral decision) that the friend group that I have is mostly guys, and they have been completely and utterly oblivious to this situation, like no one has said a word or noticed anything different about the lack of relationship that I now have with this guy. Like when I broke things off with him, he went from being really active in the group chat to pretty much radio silence apart from the odd message now and then, and no one has said anything to me. I guess it doesn’t really matter, but I’m always worried about him showing up to events that I’m invited to, especially when it could be just like one or 2 other friends, maybe they’ll be like oh yeah I invited this guy btw and he’s on his way, because of course they have no idea what’s going on. I guess that’s just my life now and I’m ok with that, but it’s just frustrating that none of the guys are being even the least bit perceptive here! 
My parents noticed that I don’t see him anymore, and they got it out of me what happened. They say that I am being too judgemental and that I should give him another chance, and it hurts that they are not being supportive. 
He has been engaged to his Fiancee for 4 years now, and I would have been in his wedding party, so I have a theory that he is never going to have the wedding now to avoid this coming out, because I definitely would not show up to his wedding.
So yeah that’s my story, and as I said, I don’t really know what I’m looking for in terms of responses to this post, but please don’t hold back, because I know I have not been perfect in this story either. Since breaking it off with him though, I do feel a huge sense of relief in a way, like when I listen to podcasts about feminism now, I feel like I can really be apart of the movement because I stood up for something that wasn’t right, even if it took me some time to get there.

I'm 28F, my sister Elsa is 22F. We're in Stockholm. Our parents are Gunnar and Birgit and I always thought they were pretty fair with us growing up. Maybe I was wrong.

So for the past two years I've been saving for a trip to Japan. It's been my dream since I was a teenager. I'm a children's book illustrator so I don't make amazing money but I've been budgeting hard. Skipping coffees, not buying new clothes, meal prepping every week. I've saved about 45,000 SEK which is like almost $4,300 USD.

I was so proud of myself. I'm finally booking the trip for April.

Yesterday my parents announced in our family group chat that they're giving Elsa 45,000 SEK as a graduation gift for finishing her certificate program.

A six month certificate program. In like. Office administration or something.

When I graduated from university with my illustration degree - four years of work - they took me to dinner and gave me a card with 500 SEK in it.

I called my mom to ask about it. Tried to stay calm. Asked why the difference.

She said it's ""not the same situation."" That Elsa ""struggled more"" with school and they wanted to ""celebrate her finally finishing something."" That I ""always had it easier academically"" so I didn't need the same encouragement.

I didn't have it EASIER. I worked part time through my entire degree. I took out loans. I just didn't complain about it constantly like Elsa does.

So basically I'm being punished for not being a mess??

I told my mom this felt really unfair and she got defensive. Said I was ""making this about money"" and that she thought I'd be ""happy for my sister.""

I AM happy for her. But I'm also hurt?? Those two things can exist at the same time??

Elsa texted me later saying she heard I was ""upset about her gift"" and that she's ""sorry I feel that way."" Not sorry about the situation. Sorry I FEEL that way.

I've been crying on and off since yesterday. Two years of sacrifice and discipline and they just hand her the same amount like it's nothing. Like my effort means nothing.

My dad hasn't said anything. He never does when mom makes decisions. I don't even know if he agrees or if he just doesn't want to fight about it.

Well I just woke up and I am 4 days sober. This is hard.

I never post on Reddit, I guess I am what they call a lurker. I just like to log in and see funny shit like cat videos or whatever. I live alone (with two cats) and I don’t really have anyone to talk to so I’m just sitting here talking to my screen. 

I grew up in a very abusive family. When we weren’t getting the shit kicked out of us, my parent’s were passed out in their bedroom with syringes and tourniquets laying around. To make things quick, this was many years. I was the kid that showed up to school at 12 years old looking like a 59 year old man. CPS got involved, they got us out of there and my parents lost their medical licenses. They went from Doctor and Nurse to unemployed and working at McDonald’s.

They eventually got back custody of us but it never stopped, so I saved up $300 and moved out when I was 17. I started community college while working at a gas station, transferred to a state college after two years while working at a restaurant and earned my bachelor’s. Started working full time, eventually started and built my own company, sold it and I am now a retired multi-millionaire at 42 years old. 

The drinking started once I had moved out at 17, it was nothing but weekend keystone lights. When work started to ramp up, it became a little more than that. I was using my lunch breaks to go home for a few stiff ones. I started to notice things were getting out of hand because of the creative avenues I was starting to take to drink, but also because I was able to be as functional as I was with an amount in my system that would make anyone else plastered. I was running a company of 400 employees working 10-12 hours in the office and in the field, taking the laptop home and working another 6 hours at night before bed. This was 7 days a week, this was not your Monday through Friday line of work. Well, I guess when you’re the owner of a company, you’re working 7 days a week regardless. 

Anyway, I started to do things like find different liquor stores to go to. I had to because, due to my status and the growth of the company, I really didn’t need anyone knowing about my habits, or at a minimum I needed to have people believe it was just recreational. I would wake up, drink a mug of half coffee, half bourbon, and bring a road soda for my 15 minute drive to work. Lunch breaks were as stated. While I was home working at night I would just have a handle next to me at my desk.

I think the biggest hit over the head was 5 days ago. I got my usual Instacart delivery of booze (Instacart became a very useful tool to avoid in person purchasing at that volume.) Anyway, my order arrives with the two big boxes of handles of liquor, wine, you name it. The Instacart delivery person said as he was leaving “should be a hell of a party, have a great day”. I said thanks and he left. Those two boxes were for me alone and would last me 2 days at most. I’m killing myself, I thought.

Long story long, today is the fourth day not drinking. I refused in patient rehab / detox because I’ve tried that once and it wasn’t for me. I’ve been prescribed medication to prevent seizures and I’m going cold turkey. It is very unpleasant, but I want to live. Again, I don’t know if this belongs here, but this is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.  ",2,1763990357.0,alcoholicsanonymous,0,1.0,False

Lemme explain the hype,"Okay, so Blackbox AI's Multi Agent Remote Execution Mode is basically like having a squad of smart AI helpers that team up to fix or build code for you, all running in the cloud so your own computer doesn't have to sweat it. It's part of their Remote Agent tool, and it rolled out around late October or early November 2025. Let me break it down super simple, like we're chatting over coffee.

Here's how the teamwork happens. Instead of one AI grinding solo, it spins up a bunch of specialized agents that work at the same time on the same problem. Think of them as pros in a band: one might focus on writing the code, another on testing it for bugs, a third on making it run faster. They all crunch away in parallel, pulling in your full project context like git history and files so nothing gets lost or forgotten. No more ""wait, what was that variable again?"" moments.

The cool twist is the LLM ""judge"",  that's another AI that watches everything and scores the outputs as they come in. It compares the different agents' work side by side, picks the best one (or mixes the good bits), and tosses the weak stuff. This happens in real time, so you get a polished result way quicker, with fewer errors than if a single AI was guessing. It's like having a referee in a coding contest who yells ""that's the winner!"" and explains why.

Since it's all remote, you can assign tasks via text, SMS, or even CLI, then check progress whenever, even if you're offline, the agents keep chugging and send updates. Youu watch a live view of them editing, testing, and iterating, and at the end, it can auto create pull requests right to your repo. Perfect for big projects where you don't want to tie up your machine or deal with slow local runs.",1,1763990196.0,BlackboxAI_,1,1.0,False

My dad (53) is abusive. When I (22) was 10, he strangled me and tried to kill me. That was the only violent incident, so I always thought that my family was alright and I was being dramatic, but it's only in recent years I've fully recognised the emotional as well as financial abuse that I've been getting put through. There were occassions where I had to actively convince therapists not to call CPS on my household. I grew up outside of the UK in a different country, so when I moved here, I assumed for years that all the abuse my sister and I were facing was just the struggles of adjusting to a new country. 

A few years ago, my parents divorced and it came to my attention how my father had been financially abusing my mother. Her paychecks all went into his account, where he then gave her an allowance, and it came out that he had a secret savings account with 10k in it that no one knew about.

My younger sister (19) moved out with my mom during the divorce and has recently cut him off completely, while I'm still living with him. I've made plans to move in with my mom and sister and leave a note where I've cut him off too, but my concern is the money that I'm paying my dad each month. I'm not sure how legally entitled I am to pay him back, or if he could do anything about it. 

Every month I pay him:

\- My phone bill which is in his name. I assume for this, I'll just have to get a new sim card and he'll cancel the contract himself?

\- Around £300 that is a monthly loan (In total 13k) that was taken out in his name. I had to get surgery a few years ago privately since the NHS waiting list was too long, and made an agreement that I'd pay him back the loan amount each month. He set up a spreadsheet to keep a record of it all

\- An extra \~300 a month that's for 'misc loans', aka some money I've genuinely borrowd from him or for if he bought me a coffee when we're out together, etc, as well as some backpayments from the surgery loan from when I was unemployed after getting made redundant and genuinely had no money to pay him.

I've already had to give him over 10k for a flat that I signed a lease for in uni, but then had to drop out because I became extremely ill and he was the guaruntor for, but for years over half of my earnings went to paying that back, as well as almost all of my maintenence loans. 

I understand that I agreed to pay back this money and the guilt is eating me alive, but I can't stand this emotional abuse any longer, and when moving out I'm going to have to help my mom with rent as she only makes enough to support my sister (and barely so), and I work just under full time. I've asked in the legal advice on how entitled I am to pay this back, but outside of this money, I just feel so conflicted and I don't know what to do about it. 

He isn't physically abusive anymore, but when he's in the house, I feel so uncomfortable. I get scared looking into his eyes because they're so dead. He's not an evil monster that I constantly have to fear and yet that's exactly how I feel. But equally I'm so financially tied to him that I don't know how to leave this situation without being the bad guy. I technically agreed with him that I'd pay back this loan, despite the fact that I was a desperate 18 year old who really needed that surgery for both my physical and mental health. And not that it changes anything, but he makes a really good amount of money, enough that I know he could easily pay it off without a worry in the world, but now my finances are being drained and I don't have enough to meaningfully make any savings or prepare for the future. My mom says he does this on  purpose because that's how he kept her tied to him, and I do feel as if since the divorce, he's just been treating me like a mini her. He even tells me how alike we are weekly. 

As well as the legal entitlement, how ethical is it for me to just leave without saying a word? I think I could technically manage to move away and still pay him and keep in contact, but if I'm being honest, I feel as if I need to cut him out completely if I was to ever be able to move forward in my life. 

Sorry for rambling, but any advice on any aspect of the situation would be helpful. I'm trying to get a therapist again, but I don't want to go through my dads insurance as that creates another tie to him so I'm searching for more affordable options in my area.

The program started this past fall and we've been at the same clinical site this first semester. We gradually started talking a bit whenever we had free time and I always enjoyed chatting with her. I went through a breakup within the first few weeks of the program, so before that I wasn't interested in anything more than friendly chats with the clinical girl. But as the months went by after the breakup and I continued talking to the clinical girl I realized I was developing some feelings for her.

I eventually mustered up the courage to ask her out for coffee. I'd never asked someone out in person before (social anxiety, go figure), so honestly I was counting that as a win in and of itself regardless of her answer. I went in expecting a no, but she said yes! I was hyped up like you wouldn't believe, y'all.

So I DMed her that night to figure out a time and day for coffee, but never got a response. A few days go by and still nothing, so I messaged to ask if we were still on for the weekend. Still nothing. By this point I knew what was going on, and I was cool with it. Still felt proud of myself for asking to begin with. I let her know it was all good if she wasn't interested in going out and made sure she got the idea that I wouldn't make it awkward in class/clinical, then I moved on.

But damn dude, I can't shake these feels lol. We still talk regularly at our clinical site and it feels like every new bit of info I learn about her I'm just like ""dang, this chick's cool as hell"". I've been enjoying our chats while trying not to treat her any differently than how I had before, but gee whiz dude she’s a super cool person. I just can't seem to flip the switch in my head back from romantic interest to friend.

I also found out we'll both be in the same group at a new clinical site starting next semester, so my hope of letting the feelings wane with distance has been thwarted. I'd request to be put at a different site, but it's one I've been really wanting to get the chance to go to and don't want to miss out. The one saving grace is that the group’ll be much bigger than our current group, so hopefully I'll be able to have more options for conversation outside of her.

So any tips on how to deal? I kinda just wanted to ramble off my thoughts, get a concrete sense of where my headspace is at, but yeah any advice would be cool too.

Preferably I'm looking for solid long term if not life connections with a few people I really click with but I can vibe with most people and do enjoy that as well. 

 I don't do much but I do take walks from time to time, I try to excercise at home, I spend too much time on my pc (doing nothing) and my phone (scrolling into nothingness) and go out to drink coffee somewhere (in my mind but never go). Life just kinda got away from me and in my spiral I hit the accelerator it seems. So I want some friends to share the misery with.

You got interests? You got nothing like me?

1p5gnpw,https://i.redd.it/binfhaqgf73g1.jpeg,"In honor of Freddie Mercury who passed 34 years ago today, let’s talk about his hypothetical birth chart 👑💜","I’ve talked about this before, not on this subreddit, but on other subs, on my Substack, in various astrology Facebook groups, and honestly half my post history probably screams, “This woman has a mildly concerning obsession with Freddie Mercury.” But I realized I’ve never brought this particular discussion here, and I wanted to revisit it with a little more emotional clarity, especially because today marks 34 years since Freddie Mercury tragically passed.

I promise I’ll try to spare you my sappy ass… but I wish more than anything that I could have seen this man in the flesh. I see so much of myself in him, the misfit energy, the “fuck your rules, I’ll do what I want” energy, the queer fluidity, the artistic chaos, and his refusal to shrink. Queen’s music genuinely shaped who I am. My late dad introduced it to me as a kid, and now my 15-month-old daughter dances to the Live Aid set like it’s in her bloodstream and the little fetus-boy inside me goes absolutely apeshit every single time I play ""Flash"". So yes, the legacy continues.

So, in honor of the legend himself, I wanted to share my theory on what I believe his birth chart actually was, since we don’t have an official birth time.  I would genuinely love to hear your thoughts, opinions, roastings, agreements, or disagreements. 

This is long. Grab a coffee. Grab an energy drink. Grab a cigarette and a boa if you want to go full Freddie about it. Settle in ad let’s begin.

Let's kick thinge off with the Moon, because with his ambiguous birth time, he is either a very late-degree Sagittarius Moon or a Capricorn Moon.

The only clue we have about his birth time is that his mother once said he was born “during office hours,” because his father was at work when he was born. Unless his dad was working in some sketchy underground office from 8am to 3am, “office hours” almost certainly meant 8:00 to 5:00.

On the day he war born, from 8:00am–9:15am ish, that gives you a 29° Sagittarius Moon. But after ~9:30am we are firmly in Capricorn Moon territory. 

I once shared this in another group, and someone reacted like I had personally offended their ancestors by suggesting Freddie might be a Capricorn Moon and accused me of projecting because I am a Capricorn Moon too. Trust me, I’m not going to spiral into a Saturn-return crisis if he’s actually a Sagittarius Moon. But I do have receipts for why I genuinely believe Freddie was a Capricorn Moon with a strong 12th house signature.

Most people look at Freddie; the flamboyance, the theatricality, the sensuality, and the larger-than-life stage presence and immediately think Sagittarius Moon. I get it. But the Moon rules our inner emotional world, our private hidden self, and the self that only a few ever see. If there is one place the Moon sign always exposes itself, it’s in lyrics.

There’s a running joke (that I think is actually true) that if you find musicians with your Moon sign, you’ll relate to them instantly. And in Freddie’s case, so much of his lyrical emotionality bleeds Capricorn. The strongest examples, in my opinion, are the songs he wrote literally while dying:

• These Are the Days of Our Lives
• The Show Must Go On

If you watch the These Are the Days of Our Lives music video (especially the unseen footage) you will watch the very essence of Capricorn Moon unfold in real time. Freddie, six months before his death, frail and in pain, frequently stepping off set to take medication yet still critiquing every shot, still demanding retakes saying, “No, the makeup isn’t right,"" still working himself to the bone with perfectionistic precision and pouring every ounce of life force he had left into his art. That is Capricorn Moon energy. Working until the literal end.  Grace Under Pressure ... pun intended.

The Show Must Go On carries similar emotional weight, but These Are the Days of Our Lives hits harder because it’s one of the only videos where you actually see Freddie’s deteriorating physical state. The official black-and-white edit tried to soften the reality, but the raw footage is absolutely gutting.

There is also testimony from those who worked with him who often said Freddie would stay hours (sometimes six, seven, eight) after the rest of the band had gone home and spent that time re-recording, pushing himself, and not stopping until something felt right. Tell me that isn’t Capricorn Moon to the bone.

There are Cap Moon emotional undercurrents in other songs he wrote:

• Under Pressure
• We Are the Champions
• Hammer to Fall
• Somebody to Love
• Too Much Love Will Kill You

All of these carry that mixture of resilience, ache, pressure, endurance, the beauty of suffering and an almost sacred sense of responsibility.

… quintessential Capricorn Moon.

Now let’s talk about that massive one hell of a 12th house stellium. Because once you move past the Moon debate, the next place the chart really screams is the 12th house.

Again, I know what you might be thinking. 12th house energy? Freddie??????? The house of mystics, monks, poets, quiet souls, and the hidden self?????? At first glance it sounds ridiculous. Freddie was anything but hidden.

But that’s exactly the point. 12th house people often hide by revealing something else entirely. Not secrecy but sacred privacy. Not smallness, rather a projected persona so large that the inner self becomes unreachable. That is Freddie Mercury to the bone.

The more I spiraled through charts, the more Freddie documentaries I binged at 3am, the more interviews and studio stories I devoured, the more it became clear that this man did not have a public personality, he had a public avatar. Which is exactly how the 12th house works.

In my opinion, that 12th house energy is clearly seen in the longing in his lyrics, the mystique he carried, the theatrical persona that he wore like armor, the intensely guarded inner world that almost no one ever touched, the hidden suffering, the spirituality, the escapism, the addictive tendencies, the secrecy of his illness and sexual orientation, and the way he chose who could access him, and how deeply.

It checks every single box. People assume 12th house = hermit. But the 12th house can also produce:

• performers who disappear into personas
• people who are “everywhere and nowhere” at the same time
• artists who give the world everything except their actual self
• people who feel their emotions more intensely when alone than when performing for millions
• souls who live behind veils whether metaphorical ones or literal ones

Freddie wasn’t private because he was shy. He was private because he was vast, and vastness is vulnerable. 12th house placements turn emotion into myth, pain into poetry, longing into performance, and hidden suffering into transcendent art.

That is exactly what Freddie did, intentionally or not.

The Libra 12th House Stellium contains Venus + Mars (chart ruler) + Jupiter + Neptune + Chiron.This specific cluster explains so much.

Venus in the 12th: Hidden love, hidden relationships, inaccessible desires, romantic mystique, longing that borders on spiritual ache.

Mars in the 12th (in Libra): Desire behind closed doors. Sexuality expressed in veiled, fantasy-driven ways. A private intensity the public never fully understood. Most devastatingly, Mars ruling the 6th house of health falling into the 12th, the house of hidden illness. If Mars rules your 6th house of health and it falls into the 12th, a literal interpretation could be a hidden long term illness that remains private, an illness connected to intimacy, an illness that weakens the body, and an illness that feels like imprisonment I don’t know how you get more textbook than that. Freddie never announced his AIDS diagnosis until the day before he died. That is 6th-house ruler in the 12th word for word. It breaks my heart every time I look at it.

Neptune in the 12th: Fantasy, delusion, addiction. Glitter and pain in the same breath. A life spent dissolving boundaries between persona and self, drag and reality, pleasure and self-destruction, and spiritual longing and physical suffering.

Jupiter + Chiron in the 12th: Epic love stories that wound. Big, sweeping emotional arcs. A mythic life lived behind curtains, and soul that heals others through what he himself could never escape.

This is the chart of a man who lived onstage but whose real self lived underwater.

& I know this next part may be controversial, but I stand by it. We often pin sexual fluidity, compersion, group play, and nontraditional relationships on Gemini or Aquarius. But I really think it's 12th house energy. It's the house where boundaries dissolve, the ego blurs, and where love, sex, pain, and spirit all start to blend in mysterious, soul-bending ways.

If you’ve heard the stories, it tracks. There’s that infamous photo of him in bed with like eight men. Which, like, hot AF, wish we were there. But also… how?! Logistically speaking, I may or may not know... four in one bed was logistical chaos 😅 EIGHT?? Jesus. Anyway, I digress.

Many lyrics were full of pleas, prayers, confessions
veiled cries, spiritual longing and emotional self-sacrifice aka everything the 12th house represents.

Specific Queen songs that scream 12th house energy:

• Love of My Life
• Lily of the Valley
• I’m Going Slightly Mad
• Spread Your Wings
• Nevermore
• My Melancholy Blues
• Is This the World We Created?
• Death on Two Legs

You can feel the ache, transcendence, isolation, rhe spiritual searching and the longing for liberation.

Again, I fully recognize there is a very real possibility he might be a Sagittarius Moon, or hell he might be a Capricorn Moon but born at some absolutely off-the-rails hour and actually be an Aries Rising or a Cancer Rising. Honestly, it would be just like Freddie to pull some cosmic stunt like that. I’m not claiming this is peer-reviewed, lab-verified, dissertation backed by astrologicaldissertation dot gov material. 

If you disagree with me, that’s totally fine. I would genuinely love to hear your interpretations. I truly enjoy hearing other perspectives, especially thoughtful ones, and I promise I’m not so attached to this theory that it requires a full-blown catastrophic meltdown like one particular commenter had last time, lol.

She goes straight for the most dangerous stuff - electrical outlets, the stairs, our dog's food bowl. Yesterday I turned around for literally five seconds to grab my phone and she was halfway to the fireplace. We already baby-proofed the house - outlet covers, cabinet locks, gates on the stairs, the whole deal. But she still finds things to get into and I can't follow her around 24/7. I've decided to get a baby play pen but our budget is pretty tight since I'm on maternity leave, so I need to be smart about what we buy. I've been comparing different options online and the variety is overwhelming but I’ve narrowed it down to Graco, Summer Infant, and Baby Trend. Some basic mesh ones run about $60-80, then there's the Regalo My Play which is around $100, and those fancy North States Superyard systems that cost $150-200+. Even found some suppliers on Alibaba selling similar setups cheaper. I just want to clarify some things:
Which style actually works better for active babies - mesh kit, wooden panels, or plastic?
How long can I realistically use it before she outgrows it or figures out how to escape?
My daughter is super active and determined, so I need something that'll actually contain her safely while I do basic things like make coffee or fold laundry. She's not the type to sit quietly so I need something that'll keep her safe while I pee or make coffee without having to strap her in every time.

I've been as supportive as possible, even helped arrange the baby shower (which was emotionally exhausting and I decided never to do that again). Their first child is nearly 3 years old and very demanding, so they're having a hard time managing both kids.

I've been open with him about the trauma I'm going through, and I even told him about how another friend's pregnancy announcement very recently wrecked me. Everything is a trigger. I said I appreciated that they didn't plaster their kids all over social media so I'm not reminded all the time.

Anyway, since the baby was born I've mostly kept my distance. Texted here and there, asked how things are going, but nothing deep. Then my friends suggests going for coffee on Saturday. I figure it would be nice to catch up and maybe talk about what's going on, because it's hard over text. He's one of the few people I can talk to and it means a lot to me that he's there when I need him.

I turn up to the coffee shop, it's very packed but I get a table. Then 5 minutes later, he arrives... With his girlfriend and their 2 kids. They turned the whole day into a family outing. Their oldest loves me so he's desperate for my attention the whole time. We go for a walk because that helps the baby get to sleep. We go to the playground so the oldest can play. Then I go home.

At first I thought I handled it alright. I had a good time really, even though there was basically zero time for proper adult talk, I do still like his kids.

Now it's a 9 days later and I regret leaving the house that day. Every night, I'm having dreams about going out with my own children. I dream that I've got a family just like their's, and I'm happy. It's so vivid. Then I wake up and remember that's not my life, I don't have a family, I have nothing. It's so painful.

Now I've circled around to being angry at my friend for bringing his whole family for coffee without telling me. He knows what I've been going through, he's normally kind and sympathetic, in fact he's usually over-cautious and apologetic to a fault. But suddenly he's rubbing his beautiful family in my face without warning? I feel betrayed, I feel almost like I was used for free childcare because I spent hours helping to entertain their oldest. I feel like having a family is so normal for him that he can no longer sympathise at all with how lonely and sad I am. I appreciate that he might not be able to go out without the kids, but I'd rather not see him if every social occasion is going to turn into daycare. It's clear he never wanted to catch up properly with me and ask me how I am, I don't know what he even wanted tbh. I'm confused and hurt. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this and it's killing me. Thank god for the internet so I can come here and people understand how I'm feeling.",9,1763989606.0,InfertilitySucks,5,1.0,False

1p5gjst,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1p5gjst/teeth_whitening_kit_vs_gel_which_lasts_longer/,Teeth whitening kit vs gel: which lasts longer?,"When you're looking to brighten your smile, you've probably noticed there are tons of options out there. Two of the most popular choices are teeth whitening kits and whitening gels on their own. But which one actually gives you results that last?

**Understanding the Difference**

Teeth whitening gel is basically the active ingredient that does the work. It usually contains hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. You can buy gel by itself, but you'll need your own trays or strips to apply it.

A teeth whitening kit comes with everything – the gel, LED lights, mouth trays, and sometimes extra tools. The kit approach means all the pieces work together as a system.

**Which Lasts Longer?**

Here's the thing: the gel itself is the same in both options. What makes results last longer isn't whether you buy gel alone or in a kit. It's about three main things:

The concentration of peroxide matters a lot. Higher concentrations (within safe limits) tend to give longer-lasting results. Most over-the-counter products range from 10-35% concentration.

How you apply it makes a difference too. Kits with custom-fit trays keep the gel in contact with your teeth better than one-size-fits-all options. Better contact means better absorption and longer-lasting whiteness.

LED light activation, which many kits include, can help the gel work more effectively. This doesn't necessarily make results last longer, but it can make the initial whitening stronger.

**Real Talk About Duration**

Whether you use gel or a complete teeth whitening kit, results typically last 3-6 months. Some people see their brightness fade after a few weeks, while others maintain their white smile for over a year.

Your habits play a huge role. Coffee, tea, red wine, and smoking will make your teeth yellow again faster. Brushing twice daily and avoiding stain-causing foods helps maintain results from any whitening treatment.

**The Practical Winner**

For most people, a complete kit is the better choice. You get proper trays that fit your mouth, the right amount of gel, and tools that help you apply everything correctly. When you buy gel alone, you still need trays and might end up spending more piecing everything together.

If you want a solid option that includes everything you need, [check out this highly-rated teeth whitening kit](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit). It comes with all the tools to help you get professional-level results at home.

**Making Results Last**

No matter which route you choose, here's how to make your whiter teeth stick around:

- Use a whitening toothpaste between treatments
- Rinse your mouth after drinking coffee or tea
- Drink dark beverages through a straw when possible
- Touch up every few months with your whitening product

**Bottom Line**

The gel is what whitens your teeth, but the delivery method affects your results. A complete teeth whitening kit usually gives better, longer-lasting results because everything's designed to work together. Plus, you don't have to hunt down separate pieces or figure out what works with what.

Ready to get started? [Grab a complete teeth whitening kit here](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit) and you'll have everything you need to brighten your smile and keep it that way.

Remember, consistency beats perfection. Whichever option you pick, using it correctly and maintaining your results with good habits will give you the bright smile you're after.",1,1763989546.0,productplace,0,1.0,False

A few weeks ago, he started following random girls on Instagram, and when I asked who they were, he got defensive and said he met them at the gym. When I explained that it made me uncomfortable, he told me I was being paranoid and jealous.

He also works night shifts and regularly has coffee with a female coworker. He’s told me that he enjoys talking to her, thinks she’s attractive, and that if he were single, he would consider a one-night stand with her.

Additionally, he still follows a girl on Instagram that he wanted to sleep with a few years ago while he was in a previous relationship. Recently, she asked him to go out for a double date, and he said it wasn’t a good time because we’re having issues. I’m worried that he might still have feelings for her.

Sometimes he gets distant and speaks to me disrespectfully, saying things like “Woman. Shut up.” He’s also said that he’s convinced I wouldn’t leave him even if he cheated.

I love him and see the good in him, but these behaviors make me feel anxious and stressed, and I’m losing sleep over it.

I’m 29, in a same sex marriage, and have lived in Rochester since June 2024.

Locally though, I’m looking for something very simple:
spaces where younger adults gather to ask real questions and explore meaning together without needing to fit into one religious box.

• I’ve explored most of the non Orthodox Jewish spaces here and will continue to be involved, but I haven’t found many people in my age group who are looking for deeper spiritual conversation.
• I enjoyed attending a Methodist church and liked the sermons, but when I reached out afterward to get more involved, nothing much came of it.
• I’ve gone to an interfaith program at a mosque and had some meaningful follow up conversations. It was a warm space, just not one that fits me long term.
• I appreciate the rigor of more traditional or text based spaces, but I also need to be in communities where mentioning my husband is completely normal.

Outside of that, I’ve been building a book club and having a few one on one coffee conversations, but the people I’ve met don’t really have advice for finding community because they’re either also looking or are busy raising children. I don’t have kids, and I’m hoping to find something regular to participate in, not just one off events.

So I’m wondering:

Are there churches, synagogues, study groups, or interfaith communities in Rochester that genuinely welcome someone in my situation, someone LGBTQ, spiritually serious, intellectually curious, and not trying to pretend to be something I’m not?

I’ve heard Artisan Church might be worth a look. Does anyone have experience there?
Are there Bible studies, discussion groups, or young adult meetups that consistently attract people in their 20s or 30s rather than just being listed on paper?

I’m not searching for a new identity. I’m looking for community and some peers. I’ve had great conversations with older adults in Rochester, but as I approach 30 I’m realizing how important it is to also build friendships with people in my own life stage.

Any suggestions are welcome, from specific places to recurring events or even people to follow locally.

Thank you in advance!

In my previous life, my best friend wanted to marry my grandfather, and due to my determined efforts to stop it, she failed.

Later, my grandfather married a girl who was about the same age as her, and they held a grand wedding.

My best friend, harboring resentment, invited me to climb a mountain, and at the peak, she stabbed me 18 times before pushing me off a cliff.

""It's all your fault for blocking me from marrying into the Duncan family! Everything was supposed to be mine!""

Reborn, I sent her and my grandfather to the altar with smile.

What she didn't know was that, over the past ten years, my grandfather had married eight brides. She was the ninth, and the previous eight brides all met untimely deaths.

Since she was so desperate to marry him, I would make her wish come true.

...

""Yesterday, I saw your grandfather at the charity dinner, and he even praised me for resembling his first love when he was young,"" Kate Gregory said excitedly, holding her coffee cup.

She grabbed my hand, her eyes full of calculation. ""I wanna pursue your grandfather.""

I was utterly shocked. ""Are you crazy? He's forty years older than you!""

""What's age got to do with it? He doesn't look over sixty at all, forty at most in appearance.""

In my previous life, I interrupted her here, sternly warning her to stay away from my grandfather, only to be met by her grim face. ""Summer Duncan, who do you think you are? What gives you the right to stand in my way?""

Later, my grandfather married a girl about our age, and they held a grand wedding. She, filled with resentment, pushed me off the cliff.

""It's all your fault for blocking me from marrying into the Duncan family! Everything was supposed to be mine!""

And now, I just stood by and quietly watched as undisguised greed filled her eyes,

My grandfather was the head of the Duncan family conglomerate, worth billions.

""Don't you mind?"" Kate seemed surprised by my silence.

I took the coffee in front of me, offering a meaningful smile. ""Why would I mind?""

""Everyone has the right to pursue happiness. Love shouldn't be limited by age, right?""

Her eyes lit up, clearly not expecting things to go so smoothly. She hugged me excitedly. ""I knew you'd understand! Don't worry, when I become your grandmother, I'll treat you well!""

Where she couldn't see, my smile completely faded.

I whispered, ""Good luck.""

My grandfather had married eight brides over the past ten years, and she was about to become the ninth.

But what she didn't know was that the previous eight brides all met untimely deaths.

Since she wanted to marry him so much, I would make her wish come true.

After leaving the coffee shop, I stood on the side of the road waiting for the driver.

A black Mercedes slowly stopped in front of me. The face of the butler, Joe Booth, appeared. ""Miss Duncan, Sir asks that you come home for dinner tonight.""

""Got it."" I opened the door and got in.

""Joe,"" I suddenly spoke up, ""How is Grandpa's health these days?""

The old butler glanced at me through the rearview mirror. ""He's in great health. His physical checkup last week showed that all his indicators are twenty years younger than his actual age.""

I clenched my fist. I never suspected Grandpa in my previous life, but now, many things seemed suspicious.

The strangest part was that every time a bride died, Grandpa was abroad on a business trip with a perfect alibi, and he had seemed quite detached after each of their deaths.

During dinner, I observed Grandpa carefully. He really did look much younger than his actual age.

""I heard you met the daughter of the Gregory family today?""

I froze. How did Grandpa know? Unless he had been monitoring me or Kate.

""Yeah, Kate is my best friend.""

Grandpa slightly smiled, ""She's a lively girl. In two days, it's my birthday banquet. You can invite her to come over and stay until the end of the banquet.""

In my previous life, I tried my best to stop Kate from getting close to Grandpa, so she had never received an official invitation from the Duncan family.

""Sure,"" I sweetly agreed.

After dinner, Grandpa would regularly take a walk in the garden, so I seized the chance to find the hidden compartment in Grandpa's study.

My mom had told me about it before she passed, but I had never opened it.

Behind Das Kapital on the third bookshelf, there was a hidden button. When pressed, a small secret room appeared.

On the table inside the room was a notebook and a password box.

I nervously opened the notebook, and what I saw almost made me scream.

Chapter 2

It was a list, neatly recording the names of eight women, their wedding dates, and their dates of death. Each name was followed by a photo, and I was horrified to find that they shared certain similarities—shapes of their eyes, the curvature of their mouths.

Especially the last three, who looked almost like identical copies of each other.

The last page had the ninth name: Kate Gregory. A red pen circled it with a question mark, and the date field was blank.

My gaze was drawn to the safe. My intuition told me it held even more terrifying secrets, but the safe required both a fingerprint and a password, which I couldn't open.

Suddenly, footsteps were heard outside. I hastily closed the notebook and quickly hid behind the curtains.

The study door opened, and Grandpa and Joe Booth entered.

""The ninth one should be the most suitable,"" Grandpa's voice was low and calm, ""Her birth chart matches perfectly.""

""We'll have all nine soon. Bring Kate Gregory to see me tomorrow.""

""Yes, sir.""

After they left, I collapsed onto the floor, cold sweat soaking my back.

Grandpa knew Kate, and it seemed like he was actively scheming something. What was even more horrific was that he seemed to be conducting some kind of... ritual that required nine brides?

The next day, my phone buzzed with a message from Kate: [Summer, big news! I received the official invitation from the Duncan family! Can I come over to visit you today?]

I stared at the screen and slowly smirked. [Of course, I'd be happy to have you.]

Kate stayed at the Duncan family mansion for two days. I did my best to create opportunities for the two of them to be alone.

The day of the birthday banquet arrived, and most of the celebrities in the capital had attended.

I stood in the corner, watching Kate cling to Grandpa's arm, who was smiling coquettishly.

Things were progressing quickly between them; it seemed both sides were eager.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" My grandpa, Morgan Duncan, stood on the stairs, gently tapping Kate's hand, his voice steady and commanding, ""Thank you all for attending my birthday banquet. Today, I have some good news to announce.""

The room fell silent, all eyes on them.

""Kate and I are genuinely compatible, and we've decided to get married.""

""Our wedding is set for three days from now. We welcome everyone to join us and witness.""

Although I had expected this, my heart still swayed for these words uncontrollably.

Guests were briefly stunned, then burst into a chorus of hollow congratulations.

After all, a sixty-year-old business tycoon marrying a young girl in her twenties was not uncommon in high society. As long as you had enough money, age was never an issue.

Kate wore a victorious smile, her gaze sweeping across the crowd before landing on me.

Was she showing off to me?

I took a sip of champagne decently, the corners of my mouth curling up, and even stepped forward, softly saying, ""Congratulations, Grandpa, congratulations, Kate.""

Grandpa nodded in satisfaction, while Kate squinted her eyes, seemingly surprised by my calmness.

Then, she wasted no time in showing her true colors.

Chapter 3

""By the way, Summer,"" she said, feigning intimacy as she grabbed my hand, raising her voice intentionally so everyone around could hear, ""Since I'm going to be the future mistress of the Duncan family, there are some things I need to take charge of.""

""Oh? What's that?""

She stared at me, each word deliberate. ""You need to call off your engagement to Jaxon.""

The Duncans and the Mortons had been longtime family friends. I'd been engaged to Jaxon, the only son of the Mortons, since childhood. Although it was a business arrangement, Jaxon had always treated me very well.

And now, she was pushing me to break off the engagement? How dare she?!

Before I could speak, Grandpa actually nodded. ""Kate's right. The Morton family has been underperforming these years, they're not a match for the Duncan family. Summer, you should cancel the engagement.""

My breath caught. From the corner of my eye, I saw Jaxon standing not far away, his glass nearly shattering in his hand.

""Grandpa,"" I heard my voice trembling, ""The engagement between the Mortons and the Duncans was arranged by our ancestors...""

""That's ancient history,"" Grandpa waved his hand dismissively. Kate immediately handed him a cigar, and he took a deep drag. ""The Morton family is nothing compared to us now. They don't deserve to be tied to us.""

Whispers started in the banquet hall. I saw Jaxon's face turn ashen, while Kate smiled triumphantly at me.

""Grandpa!"" I knelt in front of him, ""I beg you to reconsider. Even though the Morton family is going through tough times, Jaxon...""

Smack!

Kate suddenly raised her hand and knocked over a server's tray of red wine, which spilled all over me the next moment.

The guests exchanged glances, some snickering, others showing sympathy.

""Oh no, my hand slipped,"" she covered her mouth in feigned surprise, but then leaned in close to my ear, whispering in a voice only we could hear. ""You think kneeling and begging will work? After tonight, you won't even have the right to beg for mercy.""

I looked up at her, stunned.

""Enough!"" Grandpa shouted, shaking me off. ""It's settled. The engagement is canceled.""

Jaxon crushed the wine glass, glaring at Kate. But when I went upstairs to change, I saw Jaxon and Kate in a tight embrace in the hallway corner.

""Kate, did I perform well? She even knelt for me.""

""Good job! Seeing that bitch carrying the title of your fiancée really bummed me out.""

My heart twisted with pain, not expecting they'd already hooked up. I realized just how wrong my judgment had been.

""You two jerks! Damn you!"" I yelled.

Jaxon chuckled, ""Look at you, kneeling and begging like an idiot, did you really think we'd get married?""

Kate giggled, leaning into his embrace. ""Your man has long been mine.""

The two of them were truly disgusting.

""Aren't you afraid I'll tell Grandpa?""

""Go ahead!"" Kate said boldly, ""Let's see if he believes you or me.""

""When this old man dies, the Duncan family will be ours."" Jaxon wrapped his arm around her waist, fantasizing.

""I thought we were the best of friends.""

Kate sneered, ""Hmph, friends? Stop pretending. Your so-called friendship is treating me like a lapdog, tossing me some 'scraps' when you take pity on me. I've been done with you!""

""Now I've got the upper hand, you've got to behave on the leash I hold!""

Back in university, when Kate couldn't afford her tuition, I'd directly paid it for her. When she couldn't make ends meet, I'd brought her whatever I was eating. Later, when her mother fell ill, I didn't hesitate to send her to the best hospital that the Duncans owned. And in her eyes, was all of that considered 'scraps'? I should've just let her starve!

I laughed in fury. ""Well then, just consider everything I've done as feeding dogs.""

Just wait and see. Because soon, you'll both face the consequences.

Chapter 4

After the birthday banquet, Kate officially moved into the Duncan's mansion as the future Mrs. Duncan.

The first thing she did was take my room.

""Summer, your room has the best light, it's perfect for me,"" she leaned against the doorframe, ""You're moving out soon anyway, why not get used to it?""

I stood in the hallway, calmly watching her. ""If you like it, it's yours.""

Her eyes narrowed, seemingly displeased with my compliance, and then she sneered. ""Oh, by the way, Morgan said I'll be in charge of your allowance from now on. After all, you're not a kid anymore. Time to learn frugality.""

She pulled a card from her designer purse and handed it to me. ""Five grand a month, is that enough?""

Five grand? That wouldn't even cover a bracelet I used to buy on a whim.

I took the card, smiled faintly. ""Thank you, Grandma.""

Her expression froze for a moment, clearly stung by the title, but soon she regained her high-and-mighty demeanor. ""Good girl.""

I turned and went to the guest room.

The next day, Kate dragged me into her walk-in closet.

""Summer, look, is my wedding dress pretty?"" She unfurled a pure white wedding dress, the hem covered in sparkling diamonds, shining brilliantly under the light.

I nodded, ""Very beautiful.""

She suddenly sighed, pretending to be regretful. ""Actually, I wanted to choose your mother's antique wedding dress, but Morgan said it was unlucky.""

My blood ran cold. How dare she mention my mother?!

In my previous life, my mother had died in the Duncan's mansion, her cause of death a mystery. And her wedding dress had been kept in the Duncan's vault, where even I couldn't easily access it.

Kate tilted her head, admiring my instantly pale face. ""But it doesn't matter. My wedding dress is far more expensive than your mother's. Don't you think so?""

I clenched my palm tightly, barely managing to maintain my composure.

""Yeah,"" I whispered, ""I hope you can dress it on and live a few more days.""

She froze for a moment, then burst out laughing. ""Summer Duncan, you're not still thinking of revenge, are you?"" She leaned in closer, ""Don't forget, now the whole Duncan family is mine.""

On the day of the wedding, the Duncan's mansion was decorated with extreme luxury.

The wedding theme played, and Kate, holding Grandpa's arm, slowly walked towards the priest.

The guests clapped and congratulated them, while I stood in the corner, quietly watching.

When the priest opened the Bible and solemnly asked if they were willing to marry each other, Grandpa slowly raised his head and answered, ""I do."" But his gaze wasn't the usual warmth; instead, it carried a creepy apathy.

During the ring exchange, the butler walked forward carrying an exquisite velvet box, which contained a pair of rings inlaid with blood-red rubies.

They exchanged rings, and the ceremony was complete.

I saw Grandpa give a sign of relief.

The next day, the butler hurriedly came to find me.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

**PLATONIC FRIENDSHIP ONLY, AND ALSO PREFERABLY BASED IN BRITAIN/UK. TO KEEP THINGS RELEVANT, I PLEASE ASK THAT YOU ONLY MESSAGE ME IF YOU ARE GENUINELY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM FRIENDSHIPS, AND HAVE COMMON/SIMILAR INTERESTS.

We’d sit on the bleachers, him with his coffee, me with my tiny binoculars, watching the bikes roar past like lightning made of metal. The smell of burnt rubber, the echoing engines, the tension before each lap, it all stitched itself into my memory.

Dad had a favorite. Every time a Kawasaki Ninja streaked by, he’d grin and nudge me. “That’s the one,” he’d say. “Balanced, fierce, and built to fly.” I didn’t get it then, but I do now.

Years later, I still hear that echo every time a bike passes. Maybe it’s nostalgia, maybe it’s unfinished business, but I’ve decided I don’t just want to watch anymore. I’m saving up for a Kawasaki Ninja and browsing Alibaba for modification accessories to make it track-ready. I’m not chasing trophies, just the feeling of being in the ring. 

For those who own or have raced with a Ninja, how well does it handle long-term use and regular maintenance? What are the common issues or costs that come up with keeping it track-ready?

Instead of resting, my husband and I went to a quiet coffee shop and spent the time working on something we’ve been building slowly as a side project.

After my daughter was born, I was dealing with parenting stress and post partum depression. When she was four months old, I joined a traditional yoga teacher training at the Sivananda Center in Hungary. I almost skipped it because she was so little, but my husband kept encouraging me to go. Practicing yoga and meditation on a regular basis helped calm my nervous system and gave me a consistent way to recharge.

I wanted a clean meditation timer and a beautiful journal. No clutter. No gamification. No overly talkative guidance. I could not find an app that matched how I actually practice.

So we started building StillMind together as a side project. Often late at night, often tired, but motivated by the idea of creating something simple and calming.

StillMind now includes

* a calm, minimal timer
* a beautiful post-session journal
* AI guided meditations that adapt to your mood
* voice to note journaling during sessions

Our goal is for people to feel relaxed the moment they open it, like they finally found the right place to meditate.

StillMind is now live on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

We are also launching it on TinyLaunch on Monday. Would love to hear any feedback or thoughts from this community.

After dinner, Grandpa would regularly take a walk in the garden, so I seized the chance to find the hidden compartment in Grandpa's study.

My mom had told me about it before she passed, but I had never opened it.

Behind Das Kapital on the third bookshelf, there was a hidden button. When pressed, a small secret room appeared.

On the table inside the room was a notebook and a password box.

I nervously opened the notebook, and what I saw almost made me scream.

Chapter 2

It was a list, neatly recording the names of eight women, their wedding dates, and their dates of death. Each name was followed by a photo, and I was horrified to find that they shared certain similarities—shapes of their eyes, the curvature of their mouths.

Especially the last three, who looked almost like identical copies of each other.

The last page had the ninth name: Kate Gregory. A red pen circled it with a question mark, and the date field was blank.

My gaze was drawn to the safe. My intuition told me it held even more terrifying secrets, but the safe required both a fingerprint and a password, which I couldn't open.

Suddenly, footsteps were heard outside. I hastily closed the notebook and quickly hid behind the curtains.

The study door opened, and Grandpa and Joe Booth entered.

""The ninth one should be the most suitable,"" Grandpa's voice was low and calm, ""Her birth chart matches perfectly.""

""We'll have all nine soon. Bring Kate Gregory to see me tomorrow.""

""Yes, sir.""

After they left, I collapsed onto the floor, cold sweat soaking my back.

Grandpa knew Kate, and it seemed like he was actively scheming something. What was even more horrific was that he seemed to be conducting some kind of... ritual that required nine brides?

The next day, my phone buzzed with a message from Kate: [Summer, big news! I received the official invitation from the Duncan family! Can I come over to visit you today?]

I stared at the screen and slowly smirked. [Of course, I'd be happy to have you.]

Kate stayed at the Duncan family mansion for two days. I did my best to create opportunities for the two of them to be alone.

The day of the birthday banquet arrived, and most of the celebrities in the capital had attended.

I stood in the corner, watching Kate cling to Grandpa's arm, who was smiling coquettishly.

Things were progressing quickly between them; it seemed both sides were eager.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" My grandpa, Morgan Duncan, stood on the stairs, gently tapping Kate's hand, his voice steady and commanding, ""Thank you all for attending my birthday banquet. Today, I have some good news to announce.""

The room fell silent, all eyes on them.

""Kate and I are genuinely compatible, and we've decided to get married.""

""Our wedding is set for three days from now. We welcome everyone to join us and witness.""

Although I had expected this, my heart still swayed for these words uncontrollably.

Guests were briefly stunned, then burst into a chorus of hollow congratulations.

After all, a sixty-year-old business tycoon marrying a young girl in her twenties was not uncommon in high society. As long as you had enough money, age was never an issue.

Kate wore a victorious smile, her gaze sweeping across the crowd before landing on me.

Was she showing off to me?

I took a sip of champagne decently, the corners of my mouth curling up, and even stepped forward, softly saying, ""Congratulations, Grandpa, congratulations, Kate.""

Grandpa nodded in satisfaction, while Kate squinted her eyes, seemingly surprised by my calmness.

Then, she wasted no time in showing her true colors.

Chapter 3

""By the way, Summer,"" she said, feigning intimacy as she grabbed my hand, raising her voice intentionally so everyone around could hear, ""Since I'm going to be the future mistress of the Duncan family, there are some things I need to take charge of.""

""Oh? What's that?""

She stared at me, each word deliberate. ""You need to call off your engagement to Jaxon.""

The Duncans and the Mortons had been longtime family friends. I'd been engaged to Jaxon, the only son of the Mortons, since childhood. Although it was a business arrangement, Jaxon had always treated me very well.

And now, she was pushing me to break off the engagement? How dare she?!

Before I could speak, Grandpa actually nodded. ""Kate's right. The Morton family has been underperforming these years, they're not a match for the Duncan family. Summer, you should cancel the engagement.""

My breath caught. From the corner of my eye, I saw Jaxon standing not far away, his glass nearly shattering in his hand.

""Grandpa,"" I heard my voice trembling, ""The engagement between the Mortons and the Duncans was arranged by our ancestors...""

""That's ancient history,"" Grandpa waved his hand dismissively. Kate immediately handed him a cigar, and he took a deep drag. ""The Morton family is nothing compared to us now. They don't deserve to be tied to us.""

Whispers started in the banquet hall. I saw Jaxon's face turn ashen, while Kate smiled triumphantly at me.

""Grandpa!"" I knelt in front of him, ""I beg you to reconsider. Even though the Morton family is going through tough times, Jaxon...""

Smack!

Kate suddenly raised her hand and knocked over a server's tray of red wine, which spilled all over me the next moment.

The guests exchanged glances, some snickering, others showing sympathy.

""Oh no, my hand slipped,"" she covered her mouth in feigned surprise, but then leaned in close to my ear, whispering in a voice only we could hear. ""You think kneeling and begging will work? After tonight, you won't even have the right to beg for mercy.""

I looked up at her, stunned.

""Enough!"" Grandpa shouted, shaking me off. ""It's settled. The engagement is canceled.""

Jaxon crushed the wine glass, glaring at Kate. But when I went upstairs to change, I saw Jaxon and Kate in a tight embrace in the hallway corner.

""Kate, did I perform well? She even knelt for me.""

""Good job! Seeing that bitch carrying the title of your fiancée really bummed me out.""

My heart twisted with pain, not expecting they'd already hooked up. I realized just how wrong my judgment had been.

""You two jerks! Damn you!"" I yelled.

Jaxon chuckled, ""Look at you, kneeling and begging like an idiot, did you really think we'd get married?""

Kate giggled, leaning into his embrace. ""Your man has long been mine.""

The two of them were truly disgusting.

""Aren't you afraid I'll tell Grandpa?""

""Go ahead!"" Kate said boldly, ""Let's see if he believes you or me.""

""When this old man dies, the Duncan family will be ours."" Jaxon wrapped his arm around her waist, fantasizing.

""I thought we were the best of friends.""

Kate sneered, ""Hmph, friends? Stop pretending. Your so-called friendship is treating me like a lapdog, tossing me some 'scraps' when you take pity on me. I've been done with you!""

""Now I've got the upper hand, you've got to behave on the leash I hold!""

Back in university, when Kate couldn't afford her tuition, I'd directly paid it for her. When she couldn't make ends meet, I'd brought her whatever I was eating. Later, when her mother fell ill, I didn't hesitate to send her to the best hospital that the Duncans owned. And in her eyes, was all of that considered 'scraps'? I should've just let her starve!

I laughed in fury. ""Well then, just consider everything I've done as feeding dogs.""

Just wait and see. Because soon, you'll both face the consequences.

Chapter 4

After the birthday banquet, Kate officially moved into the Duncan's mansion as the future Mrs. Duncan.

The first thing she did was take my room.

""Summer, your room has the best light, it's perfect for me,"" she leaned against the doorframe, ""You're moving out soon anyway, why not get used to it?""

I stood in the hallway, calmly watching her. ""If you like it, it's yours.""

Her eyes narrowed, seemingly displeased with my compliance, and then she sneered. ""Oh, by the way, Morgan said I'll be in charge of your allowance from now on. After all, you're not a kid anymore. Time to learn frugality.""

She pulled a card from her designer purse and handed it to me. ""Five grand a month, is that enough?""

Five grand? That wouldn't even cover a bracelet I used to buy on a whim.

I took the card, smiled faintly. ""Thank you, Grandma.""

Her expression froze for a moment, clearly stung by the title, but soon she regained her high-and-mighty demeanor. ""Good girl.""

I turned and went to the guest room.

The next day, Kate dragged me into her walk-in closet.

""Summer, look, is my wedding dress pretty?"" She unfurled a pure white wedding dress, the hem covered in sparkling diamonds, shining brilliantly under the light.

I nodded, ""Very beautiful.""

She suddenly sighed, pretending to be regretful. ""Actually, I wanted to choose your mother's antique wedding dress, but Morgan said it was unlucky.""

My blood ran cold. How dare she mention my mother?!

In my previous life, my mother had died in the Duncan's mansion, her cause of death a mystery. And her wedding dress had been kept in the Duncan's vault, where even I couldn't easily access it.

Kate tilted her head, admiring my instantly pale face. ""But it doesn't matter. My wedding dress is far more expensive than your mother's. Don't you think so?""

I clenched my palm tightly, barely managing to maintain my composure.

""Yeah,"" I whispered, ""I hope you can dress it on and live a few more days.""

She froze for a moment, then burst out laughing. ""Summer Duncan, you're not still thinking of revenge, are you?"" She leaned in closer, ""Don't forget, now the whole Duncan family is mine.""

On the day of the wedding, the Duncan's mansion was decorated with extreme luxury.

The wedding theme played, and Kate, holding Grandpa's arm, slowly walked towards the priest.

The guests clapped and congratulated them, while I stood in the corner, quietly watching.

When the priest opened the Bible and solemnly asked if they were willing to marry each other, Grandpa slowly raised his head and answered, ""I do."" But his gaze wasn't the usual warmth; instead, it carried a creepy apathy.

During the ring exchange, the butler walked forward carrying an exquisite velvet box, which contained a pair of rings inlaid with blood-red rubies.

They exchanged rings, and the ceremony was complete.

I saw Grandpa give a sign of relief.

The next day, the butler hurriedly came to find me.

""Miss Duncan, something terrible happened to Madam...""

My fiancé and I (we’re both in our mid 20s) have been together for 4 years. He proposed last year, it was the best day of my life and ever since then we’ve been preparing for our future. He bought a very lovely apartment for us. We chose very cute apartment with an amazing view and it felt like home as soon as we stepped inside. We then spent a year renovating it together. We picked out tiles, debated over small details, imagined where the Christmas tree would go, designed the kids bedroom… all renovations were almost finalized and we were supposed to finally move in this November. We were supposed to have a small ceremony with our loved ones, I even picked out my wedding dress, looked at cute mugs we’d drink coffee from in the mornings before work, thought about what meals I would cook for him on our mornings in our new home.

Then everything changed.

A couple of months ago he discovered something was wrong with his health. After a chain of tests and visits to specialists, he was diagnosed with a type of cancer I had never even heard of before: MPNST. A sarcoma. Aggressive and unbelievably rare. And worst of all, the doctors say it’s essentially incurable.
He has already started chemotherapy and we’re waiting for an additional test results to see if he has any mutations that might make immunotherapy an option for treatment. 

Every day feels like we’re clinging to tiny bits of hope while staring into a future that terrifies me.

I can’t explain what it feels like to go from planning a normal life—marriage, a home, routines, holidays, the small domestic things—to suddenly researching cancer treatments, survival statistics, and stories of people diagnosed with the same thing. I lie awake at night reading medical papers I barely understand. Now all I worry about is whether he’s going to live. Whether he’ll make it to our wedding. Whether this home we built together will ever really be ours.

I feel guilty for being scared. Guilty for imagining a future without him. Guilty for thinking about how young we are and how this is not how life was supposed to go. But I’m terrified. I feel like our future has been ripped out of my hands and replaced with something I don’t know how to face.

I am just lost. I cant focus on anything. This has made me re-evaluate everything in my life. Things i worried about before is meaningless now. Things like - a scratch on my car, or failed exam, or a deadline at work… all seem so useless and worthless to worry about. As soon as it comes to health, everything else becomes secondary. 

Please hug your loved ones, tell them you love them and be present as much as you can. We never have as much time as we think we have. 

Enjoy every moment❤️

I know that the common refrain is ""go grey"" but fuck that, if I'm buying grey I want a discount for buying second hand and for forgoing the official warranty.

Overall, my experience buying watches luxury watches in Europe has made me feel like I don't want to deal with their attitude.

1. Went to a Bucherer store in Hamburg with family while on vacation in 2023. The salespeople were not very enthusiastic about selling to us, we had gone in to enquire about their Longines models since my mom wanted one. They even laughed when my dad asked if they dealt in Frank Muller watches. Until my mom selected a Longines watch that she liked. Only then did the saleswoman actually offer us seats and tea/coffee/water etc.

2. Took an appointment with El Cronometro in Spain for Rolex this year. The salespeople made me sit down and wait for 15 minutes for someone to become available to deal with me, which was surprising given that I had actually taken an appointment. When she finally became available I told the lady I wanted to buy a watch for my father and she said ""we don't have anything for sale except a gold sky dweller"". When I pointed out that I had taken an appointment she still stuck to the same line. For the record they had plenty of watches on display with physical store-made price tags put next to the watches - which means these are watches actually available for sale and not reserved.
 * Contrast this with the folks at Gassan Singapore on the other hand were nice enough to inform me over email that they had no stock so I was welcome to try on some watches but they wouldn't be able to sell me one on the day of my planned visit.

3. Took an appointment with Hausmann in Rome for Rolex this year. I had earlier had an amazing experience with their salespeople at their Tudor Boutique, so I thought ""finally a dealer that actually cares to make customers"". The saleswoman assigned to me at their Rolex boutique had a very condescending and disinterested attitude, like I was some vermin. When I told her that my dad doesn't like to wear gold she was like ""we only have one datejust in steel available"" and she did not even want to let me touch the watch, let alone try it on. Then I asked her about the new model that was launched this year, she said it's already sold to another customer. I asked her if I could see it so that I could choose between the datejust and the land dweller, and she said ""you can see it if you like and we do register interest from customers, but we only call the locals so I can't tell you when we will be able to give you the watch"". I asked her if I could register interest anyway, and she sniggered when she took down my details. Then she handed me a store card - not her sales card FYI - and told me that I should ""memorize the number"", like I'm some illiterate from the boonies. I mean, what the fuck? I felt so humiliated that I feel like I will not buy anything from this dealer in the future, even if they contact me.

4. The Rocca Milan store did not want to let me try on watches without an appointment ""for safety reasons"".
 * Contrast this with the Rocca Rome Airport store where the lady was very polite and helpful, even though she had nothing for sale.

It's quite ironic because the majority of luxury apparel brands had zero problems with good customer service. Except the Fendi store at Serravalle, fuck them for showing absolutely zero interest.

The Omega Boutique at Rome Airport was fantastic however. Very helpful and enthusiastic about trying to make a sale. I felt bad about not buying anything because I didn't like how they fit on my wrist.

In my previous life, my best friend wanted to marry my grandfather, and due to my determined efforts to stop it, she failed.

Later, my grandfather married a girl who was about the same age as her, and they held a grand wedding.

My best friend, harboring resentment, invited me to climb a mountain, and at the peak, she stabbed me 18 times before pushing me off a cliff.

""It's all your fault for blocking me from marrying into the Duncan family! Everything was supposed to be mine!""

Reborn, I sent her and my grandfather to the altar with smile.

What she didn't know was that, over the past ten years, my grandfather had married eight brides. She was the ninth, and the previous eight brides all met untimely deaths.

Since she was so desperate to marry him, I would make her wish come true.

...

""Yesterday, I saw your grandfather at the charity dinner, and he even praised me for resembling his first love when he was young,"" Kate Gregory said excitedly, holding her coffee cup.

She grabbed my hand, her eyes full of calculation. ""I wanna pursue your grandfather.""

I was utterly shocked. ""Are you crazy? He's forty years older than you!""

""What's age got to do with it? He doesn't look over sixty at all, forty at most in appearance.""

In my previous life, I interrupted her here, sternly warning her to stay away from my grandfather, only to be met by her grim face. ""Summer Duncan, who do you think you are? What gives you the right to stand in my way?""

Later, my grandfather married a girl about our age, and they held a grand wedding. She, filled with resentment, pushed me off the cliff.

""It's all your fault for blocking me from marrying into the Duncan family! Everything was supposed to be mine!""

And now, I just stood by and quietly watched as undisguised greed filled her eyes,

My grandfather was the head of the Duncan family conglomerate, worth billions.

""Don't you mind?"" Kate seemed surprised by my silence.

I took the coffee in front of me, offering a meaningful smile. ""Why would I mind?""

""Everyone has the right to pursue happiness. Love shouldn't be limited by age, right?""

Her eyes lit up, clearly not expecting things to go so smoothly. She hugged me excitedly. ""I knew you'd understand! Don't worry, when I become your grandmother, I'll treat you well!""

Where she couldn't see, my smile completely faded.

I whispered, ""Good luck.""

My grandfather had married eight brides over the past ten years, and she was about to become the ninth.

But what she didn't know was that the previous eight brides all met untimely deaths.

Since she wanted to marry him so much, I would make her wish come true.

After leaving the coffee shop, I stood on the side of the road waiting for the driver.

A black Mercedes slowly stopped in front of me. The face of the butler, Joe Booth, appeared. ""Miss Duncan, Sir asks that you come home for dinner tonight.""

""Got it."" I opened the door and got in.

""Joe,"" I suddenly spoke up, ""How is Grandpa's health these days?""

The old butler glanced at me through the rearview mirror. ""He's in great health. His physical checkup last week showed that all his indicators are twenty years younger than his actual age.""

I clenched my fist. I never suspected Grandpa in my previous life, but now, many things seemed suspicious.

The strangest part was that every time a bride died, Grandpa was abroad on a business trip with a perfect alibi, and he had seemed quite detached after each of their deaths.

During dinner, I observed Grandpa carefully. He really did look much younger than his actual age.

""I heard you met the daughter of the Gregory family today?""

I froze. How did Grandpa know? Unless he had been monitoring me or Kate.

""Yeah, Kate is my best friend.""

Grandpa slightly smiled, ""She's a lively girl. In two days, it's my birthday banquet. You can invite her to come over and stay until the end of the banquet.""

In my previous life, I tried my best to stop Kate from getting close to Grandpa, so she had never received an official invitation from the Duncan family.

""Sure,"" I sweetly agreed.

After dinner, Grandpa would regularly take a walk in the garden, so I seized the chance to find the hidden compartment in Grandpa's study.

My mom had told me about it before she passed, but I had never opened it.

Behind Das Kapital on the third bookshelf, there was a hidden button. When pressed, a small secret room appeared.

On the table inside the room was a notebook and a password box.

I nervously opened the notebook, and what I saw almost made me scream.

My gaze was drawn to the safe. My intuition told me it held even more terrifying secrets, but the safe required both a fingerprint and a password, which I couldn't open.

Suddenly, footsteps were heard outside. I hastily closed the notebook and quickly hid behind the curtains.

The study door opened, and Grandpa and Joe Booth entered.

""The ninth one should be the most suitable,"" Grandpa's voice was low and calm, ""Her birth chart matches perfectly.""

""We'll have all nine soon. Bring Kate Gregory to see me tomorrow.""

""Yes, sir.""

After they left, I collapsed onto the floor, cold sweat soaking my back.

Grandpa knew Kate, and it seemed like he was actively scheming something. What was even more horrific was that he seemed to be conducting some kind of... ritual that required nine brides?

The next day, my phone buzzed with a message from Kate: [Summer, big news! I received the official invitation from the Duncan family! Can I come over to visit you today?]

I stared at the screen and slowly smirked. [Of course, I'd be happy to have you.]

Kate stayed at the Duncan family mansion for two days. I did my best to create opportunities for the two of them to be alone.

Things were progressing quickly between them; it seemed both sides were eager.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" My grandpa, Morgan Duncan, stood on the stairs, gently tapping Kate's hand, his voice steady and commanding, ""Thank you all for attending my birthday banquet. Today, I have some good news to announce.""

The room fell silent, all eyes on them.

""Kate and I are genuinely compatible, and we've decided to get married.""

""Our wedding is set for three days from now. We welcome everyone to join us and witness.""

Although I had expected this, my heart still swayed for these words uncontrollably.

Guests were briefly stunned, then burst into a chorus of hollow congratulations.

After all, a sixty-year-old business tycoon marrying a young girl in her twenties was not uncommon in high society. As long as you had enough money, age was never an issue.

Kate wore a victorious smile, her gaze sweeping across the crowd before landing on me.

Was she showing off to me?

I took a sip of champagne decently, the corners of my mouth curling up, and even stepped forward, softly saying, ""Congratulations, Grandpa, congratulations, Kate.""

Grandpa nodded in satisfaction, while Kate squinted her eyes, seemingly surprised by my calmness.

Then, she wasted no time in showing her true colors.

Chapter 3

""By the way, Summer,"" she said, feigning intimacy as she grabbed my hand, raising her voice intentionally so everyone around could hear, ""Since I'm going to be the future mistress of the Duncan family, there are some things I need to take charge of.""

""Oh? What's that?""

She stared at me, each word deliberate. ""You need to call off your engagement to Jaxon.""

The Duncans and the Mortons had been longtime family friends. I'd been engaged to Jaxon, the only son of the Mortons, since childhood. Although it was a business arrangement, Jaxon had always treated me very well.

And now, she was pushing me to break off the engagement? How dare she?!

Before I could speak, Grandpa actually nodded. ""Kate's right. The Morton family has been underperforming these years, they're not a match for the Duncan family. Summer, you should cancel the engagement.""

My breath caught. From the corner of my eye, I saw Jaxon standing not far away, his glass nearly shattering in his hand.

""Grandpa,"" I heard my voice trembling, ""The engagement between the Mortons and the Duncans was arranged by our ancestors...""

""That's ancient history,"" Grandpa waved his hand dismissively. Kate immediately handed him a cigar, and he took a deep drag. ""The Morton family is nothing compared to us now. They don't deserve to be tied to us.""

Whispers started in the banquet hall. I saw Jaxon's face turn ashen, while Kate smiled triumphantly at me.

""Grandpa!"" I knelt in front of him, ""I beg you to reconsider. Even though the Morton family is going through tough times, Jaxon...""

Smack!

Kate suddenly raised her hand and knocked over a server's tray of red wine, which spilled all over me the next moment.

The guests exchanged glances, some snickering, others showing sympathy.

""Oh no, my hand slipped,"" she covered her mouth in feigned surprise, but then leaned in close to my ear, whispering in a voice only we could hear. ""You think kneeling and begging will work? After tonight, you won't even have the right to beg for mercy.""

I looked up at her, stunned.

""Enough!"" Grandpa shouted, shaking me off. ""It's settled. The engagement is canceled.""

Jaxon crushed the wine glass, glaring at Kate. But when I went upstairs to change, I saw Jaxon and Kate in a tight embrace in the hallway corner.

""Kate, did I perform well? She even knelt for me.""

""Good job! Seeing that bitch carrying the title of your fiancée really bummed me out.""

My heart twisted with pain, not expecting they'd already hooked up. I realized just how wrong my judgment had been.

""You two jerks! Damn you!"" I yelled.

Jaxon chuckled, ""Look at you, kneeling and begging like an idiot, did you really think we'd get married?""

Kate giggled, leaning into his embrace. ""Your man has long been mine.""

The two of them were truly disgusting.

""Aren't you afraid I'll tell Grandpa?""

""Go ahead!"" Kate said boldly, ""Let's see if he believes you or me.""

""When this old man dies, the Duncan family will be ours."" Jaxon wrapped his arm around her waist, fantasizing.

""I thought we were the best of friends.""

Kate sneered, ""Hmph, friends? Stop pretending. Your so-called friendship is treating me like a lapdog, tossing me some 'scraps' when you take pity on me. I've been done with you!""

""Now I've got the upper hand, you've got to behave on the leash I hold!""

Back in university, when Kate couldn't afford her tuition, I'd directly paid it for her. When she couldn't make ends meet, I'd brought her whatever I was eating. Later, when her mother fell ill, I didn't hesitate to send her to the best hospital that the Duncans owned. And in her eyes, was all of that considered 'scraps'? I should've just let her starve!

I laughed in fury. ""Well then, just consider everything I've done as feeding dogs.""

Just wait and see. Because soon, you'll both face the consequences.

Chapter 4

After the birthday banquet, Kate officially moved into the Duncan's mansion as the future Mrs. Duncan.

The first thing she did was take my room.

""Summer, your room has the best light, it's perfect for me,"" she leaned against the doorframe, ""You're moving out soon anyway, why not get used to it?""

I stood in the hallway, calmly watching her. ""If you like it, it's yours.""

Her eyes narrowed, seemingly displeased with my compliance, and then she sneered. ""Oh, by the way, Morgan said I'll be in charge of your allowance from now on. After all, you're not a kid anymore. Time to learn frugality.""

She pulled a card from her designer purse and handed it to me. ""Five grand a month, is that enough?""

Five grand? That wouldn't even cover a bracelet I used to buy on a whim.

I took the card, smiled faintly. ""Thank you, Grandma.""

Her expression froze for a moment, clearly stung by the title, but soon she regained her high-and-mighty demeanor. ""Good girl.""

I turned and went to the guest room.

The next day, Kate dragged me into her walk-in closet.

""Summer, look, is my wedding dress pretty?"" She unfurled a pure white wedding dress, the hem covered in sparkling diamonds, shining brilliantly under the light.

I nodded, ""Very beautiful.""

She suddenly sighed, pretending to be regretful. ""Actually, I wanted to choose your mother's antique wedding dress, but Morgan said it was unlucky.""

My blood ran cold. How dare she mention my mother?!

In my previous life, my mother had died in the Duncan's mansion, her cause of death a mystery. And her wedding dress had been kept in the Duncan's vault, where even I couldn't easily access it.

Kate tilted her head, admiring my instantly pale face. ""But it doesn't matter. My wedding dress is far more expensive than your mother's. Don't you think so?""

I clenched my palm tightly, barely managing to maintain my composure.

""Yeah,"" I whispered, ""I hope you can dress it on and live a few more days.""

She froze for a moment, then burst out laughing. ""Summer Duncan, you're not still thinking of revenge, are you?"" She leaned in closer, ""Don't forget, now the whole Duncan family is mine.""

On the day of the wedding, the Duncan's mansion was decorated with extreme luxury.

The wedding theme played, and Kate, holding Grandpa's arm, slowly walked towards the priest.

The guests clapped and congratulated them, while I stood in the corner, quietly watching.

When the priest opened the Bible and solemnly asked if they were willing to marry each other, Grandpa slowly raised his head and answered, ""I do."" But his gaze wasn't the usual warmth; instead, it carried a creepy apathy.

During the ring exchange, the butler walked forward carrying an exquisite velvet box, which contained a pair of rings inlaid with blood-red rubies.

They exchanged rings, and the ceremony was complete.

I saw Grandpa give a sign of relief.

The next day, the butler hurriedly came to find me.

""Miss Duncan, something terrible happened to Madam...""

1p5fuo1,https://i.redd.it/64fbkjlo873g1.jpeg,Looking for ‘Meadow’s second chance’ link please,"""Stella is my Mate.""
Rufus's words slash the night air, his arm circling her waist while every eye in the pack pins me to the dirt. 
I feel our connection sever as he publicly chooses her, humiliation and agony tearing through me.
My own wolf—Rebel—howls that he is 'ours', but he silences her with a single smirk, publicly branding another female on the very ground where our bond should have ignited. 
In that second I taste the ultimate rejection: fated mate, leaving me trash beneath their golden heels.
———————
Our eyes are locked for a second, Rebel is present but not close to the surface to be noticed by others and my world shatters.
""Stella is my Mate."" Rufus, our future Gamma, says as he turns to his girlfriend of three months. 
Why is he claiming her as his Mate? Why isn't he holding me, like he should?
Once again a man, that is supposed to care for me, turns his back on me. A man that is supposed to love me, that is supposed to keep me safe. Once again I am shown that I am not worthy.
I am not worthy of love. I am not worthy to protect. 
I get so caught up in my head that I don't realize that someone is picking me up, nor do I see where we are going. All I can see is Rufus' eyes as he realizes that I am his fated Mate, but again I am shown that I am not worth anything.
""Meadow."" I hear a voice next to my head, but I can't seem to pull myself from the depths of my mind.
I can feel that Rebel is pushing forward. I hear her voice, but it sounds as if I am miles away.
""My Human can't handle the rejection. You know her past and with claiming Stella as his Mate, Rufus has hurt her worse than anyone else has ever done."" Rebel, my Lycan, says.
I can hear voices around me, but the words don't make sense to me and I curl into a ball in the back of my own head.
I hear Florence ask Rebel, ""When did you show up?""
""About three weeks ago, but until now we didn't understand why."" Rebel answers her.
I hear a lot of growls around me, sounds like they don't like what Rebel is implying.
Brooklyn has been with me for the past three days and slowly my friends have been able to pull me from the depths of my mind.
I slowly get back to my routine, training and running border patrol helps me keep my anger in check and Rebel is able to take control a little more often. She doesn't have to hide for my friends, but we are still careful with when and where we shift.
Each of them lets me vent my anger, their Brothers let me use them as punching bags and I start to feel alive again. It also helped me to make a decision, if Stella will continue the lie Rufus started than I am gone.
Hayden managed to get Alpha Hank to sign my papers for Renegade territory, according to Hayden he didn't even look at the papers. Not that it surprised me, why would a man in this Pack care about a woman that no one knows.
Going to sleep isn't one of my favorite things anymore, I keep seeing his eyes and I keep hearing his voice. Reminding me of the fact that I am worthless and no matter how often Rebel tells me that I am not worthless, it is constantly there.
Each day I head to the clearing near our eastern border, just a few minutes from school. It is the spot where I met my friends and it has become our training spot, I don't want anyone to see me train. 
It took Brooklyn a few weeks before she asked me if they could bring their Brothers and it took months before I trusted them enough to let them help me with my training.
The nine of us have a brutal training schedule, but right now I welcome it and every day I fall asleep exhausted. Not that I am asleep long, but it is enough to keep me from getting sleep deprived.
Physically I get stronger with each passing day, mentally is a different story.
I need to get pulled out of my own head multiple times a day and the only remedy seems to be to keep myself busy. 
I get more determined to leave Gold Moon with each day and it gets solidified every time I hear someone mention Rufus and Stella. Rebel gets more agitated each time she hears his name and she takes it out on any Rogue we can find during our border patrols.
Rumors have been going around the Pack about the dead Rogues near our borders, but so far no one knows who is responsible for killing them and I doubt anyone would ever point their finger in my direction.
It has been almost six weeks since Rufus chose Stella over me and the closer we get to her eighteenth birthday, the more agitated I get.
My friends keep telling me that Stella would never take another's fated Mate, but Rebel and I know that she is a power hungry She-wolf. She always made it clear that she wanted a High-ranking Mate and that she would stop at nothing to get what she wanted.
It had been a huge problem during our class on the Mate-bond in school and even after our Luna told her that she couldn't take another's fated Mated, she kept saying that she would never settle for anything lower than a Gamma.
""Meadow, calm down. Are you trying to kill me?"" I hear Tyson ask and I realize that my mind had wandered to Rufus and Stella during training.
I am glad that Tyson and his Lycan know me well enough or they might have tried even harder to stop me.
I let myself fall on my back and with my eyes closed I try to calm myself down. I haven't lost control like this in the past six weeks, but I think it is finally taking a toll on me.
Not knowing if Stella will accept that Rufus isn't hers. Not knowing if Rufus will finally tell the truth. Not understanding why my fated Mate would do this to me.
There are always so many questions running through my head, I doubt anyone could make sense of it. I know I can't and I have tried.
I am standing at the back of the crowd with my friends, the only people I consider family. Brooklyn is standing to my left, her arm loosely wrapped around my waist and Florence is to my right. Dakota and Madison are standing behind me, making it almost impossible for anyone to see me.
Their Brothers are standing around the five of us and we all watch as Stella walks out of the Pack-house, her arm around Rufus' waist. 
Stella is wearing thigh high boots with a stiletto heel, her skirt barely covers her hip and the top barely covers her breasts. Her brown hair is hanging down her back and she is wearing six layers of make-up as usual.
Stella stops in front of the crowd, in a few minutes it will be her eighteenth birthday. Everyone is curious if Rufus was telling the truth, most hope that it is true and only a handful know for sure it is a lie.
For the past six weeks I have been hoping and waiting for Rufus to finally come to his senses, but tonight that hope will probably get crushed.
Six weeks ago Rufus turned eighteen and at that age we are able to find our fated Mate. If you don't find your Mate on your eighteenth birthday, you have to wait for a Full Moon.
I am not supposed to know that Rufus is my fated Mate, but then again I have never heard of someone getting their other half early. Okay, that isn't completely true. Sometimes it happens that they show up a few days or weeks before someone turns eighteen, but not eighteen months early.
Rebel had growled in my head, when Rufus had announced in front of everyone that Stella was his Mate. Stella couldn't confirm it until tonight, her eighteenth birthday and she will crush my hopes if she announces that Rufus had been right.
""Rufus is my Mate."" I hear Stella say and soft growls come from the men and women that are standing around me, the only friends I have in this Pack.
""I am going to bed, Brooklyn. I can't stay."" I whisper as I turn around and all my friends follow me back to the house. They know what is going on and none of them are too happy about it, but there isn't much we can do.
I am done, I have had enough. This was the last drop and I know what I have to do.
Despite being exhausted, I toss and turn for a long time and finally I drift off to sleep with the thought of leaving early in the morning.
I wake to a blood curdling scream, a second later a mournful howl is heard through the territory.
For a moment I contemplate on staying where I am, in my warm and comfy bed. Then of course I start to wonder what happened and if I want any answers, lying here in bed won't get me those answers.
The moment I open my door, I see that every door to my left and right are open as well. We all run out of the house to get to the Pack-house as fast as we can. 
""Can you believe that Alpha Hank went to see Alpha Lincoln without back-up?"" Hayden asks, not directing the question to anyone. We both know that someone will answer and our Pack-members don't disappoint.
At least now I understand the blood curdling scream I heard, the bond with his Mate must have been severed and that only means one thing, we have a new Alpha.
It doesn't take long before the rumors start flying and I keep close to Dakota to find out what is being told through the mind-link. There are only eight Pack-members that know the truth about me and one of those things is why I don't have a link to our Pack.
Normally a Wolf or Lycan get initiated into the Pack the day after they turn sixteen and that allows them to link whoever they need to link. In my case, no one ever bothered with me and that included my initiation into the Pack. It never happened and most of the time I am fine with it, it is moments like this that I hate not having the Pack-bond.
Thanks to my enhanced hearing, I am able to piece together some of the story. Sounds like Alpha Hank decided to visit Alpha Lincoln on his own to broker an alliance, but somewhere during the visit things went south and now we have a new Alpha.
I am surrounded by my friends, when Madison leans closer to me. ""Still planning on leaving, Meadow?"" She whispers and all I can do is nod my head. This doesn't change my plans, I will be gone before our new Alpha arrives and I will join the Renegades to serve the Elders.
Half an hour later everyone goes back in their rooms in the Pack-house or they head home, this house has been my home since I turned fourteen and it seems that no one is missing me at my birth home. I wait another hour, before opening the door again and I stare at the sky as I close the door to the only real home I have known for years.
I slowly make my way down the stairs and from time to time I stop to listen, but it seems that everyone is fast asleep.
Getting closer to the border, I realize that no one is actually running the borders anymore. They are too busy talking about what could have happened between Alpha Hank and Alpha Lincoln and it suits me just fine.
The moment I see the SUV, I start smiling. Hayden, Brooklyn's Brother, gave it to me six months ago, when he got a new one from his Father and inside is everything I am going to need from here on out.
I look over my shoulder towards the Pack-house, the last sliver of hope I had fades away and I whisper goodbye to my friends, the closest thing to a family I have.
Black Valley PackWhat the heck is this Idiot thinking? Probably not much, if you were to ask the current and future leadership of Black Valley Pack. 
Every one of them was expecting Alpha Hank to show up with his Beta and a handful of Warriors, at the very least.
But to their surprise, he is all by himself. Even Black Valley's Alpha wouldn't be this stupid and he is feared by many Alphas, not just because he is a Lycan but also because of his short fuse.
For the past four months they have been sending an alliance agreement back and forth through email and every time Alpha Hank claims he has made adjustments to it, but they have all been minor changes. He is an Alpha that wants to take, instead of giving and yesterday Alpha Lincoln called him to tell him there would be no alliance.
Can you imagine their surprise when they were linked by one of their Warriors, informing them of his arrival and all by himself no less. And why would he come visit them after one in the morning, this could have waited until daytime.
The door of the SUV opens and looking at the male that is exiting the vehicle, they are even more surprised at his lack of self-preservation. He must be 6""1 at most and he certainly looks as if he is at the end of his life, but he is only fifty eight years old.
""Alpha Lincoln, I thought it was wise if we discussed our alliance face to face. It will make it easier to explain certain changes I made and you can ask me any question immediately, instead of waiting for me to reply to an email. I am a busy man as you can imagine."" He says as he walks up the steps of the front porch.
""I told you yesterday, there will be no alliance."" Alpha Lincoln growls at him and the Idiot has the nerve to start laughing.
""Alpha Lincoln, you are just trying to drive a hard bargain and I won't hold it against you."" Alpha Hank says as he walks past Alpha Lincoln, into the Pack-house. ""I think I have what you want to close this deal and in a few years we will be telling our Grandpups this story.""
Current and future leadership look at one another and each has the same confusion in their eyes, none of them has a freaking idea what the Idiot is babbling about.
""Get me some coffee, woman."" Alpha Hank growls in the direction of the Luna and both her Sons grab their Father's arms to stop him from committing murder. The Luna just looks at him, her ""don't screw with me"" mask in place and you can hear his Beta chuckle as she just leaves him standing there.
She walks up the stairs and they know they won't be seeing her during this meeting, unless something else happens. 
""Alpha Lincoln, I want to discuss this in your office. I have no need for stupid questions from Pups or females, they can never understand the kind of things we need to discuss."" Alpha Hank says and he turns towards the hallway.
""You can discuss this here in the living room or you can go home. I don't care which you pick, but make it quick. I would like to spend some time with my Mate."" Alpha Lincoln says to the Idiot and he sits down in an armchair.
Alpha Hank's eyes roam across the room, looking at every male and female present in the room. His eyes stop on the Beta's Daughter and a small smile appears on his face, ""Yeah, I can't blame you for wanting to spend time with that."" He says and Makay, the future Beta, has him slammed into the wall in seconds.
""First you disrespect our Luna and now you disrespect my baby Sister. I should snap your freaking neck, Dipshit."" Makay growls, his face an inch away from his.
""Get the heck out of my territory and don't ever come back or next time I will end you."" Alpha Lincoln says, before Makay drops him on the floor and takes a few steps back.
""Alpha Lincoln, how can I disrespect your Mate? I have never met her in my life."" Alpha Hank says. His eyes widen when he sees the Luna with her arms wrapped around Alpha Lincoln. He realizes what he had done, but the Asshat isn't apologizing for it.
""Oh, my. The Goddess hasn't been kind to you, Alpha Lincoln. She must have been drunk or something for pairing you with that."" He says laughing, while looking at the Luna and that is when all inferno breaks loose.
Everyone tries to stop Kenyon, Alpha Lincoln's Lycan, from taking control, but it is a losing battle. No one can stop him from making this Idiot pay for disrespecting his Mate and it is over within less than a minute. 
Blood spraying from the cut across his throat and the moment Alpha Hank's lifeless body hits the floor, Kenyon turns to walk into his Mate's waiting arms.
He can hear people walking around the room, but with his face buried in the crook of his Mate's neck he can't see what is happening.
""Alpha Lincoln, the Elders will support you. This was a justified kill, he had no right to insult Luna Leona the way he did."" Elder Carmen says and everyone is glad there is an eye-witness to support their Alpha.
Multiple people groan out loud, by killing Alpha Hank, I they are suddenly responsible for two Packs. 
They decide to leave in the morning, after a goodnight's rest, morning still comes to fast for most and after breakfast they gather in the Alpha office. 
They head out to make the one hour and fifteen minute drive to Gold Moon Pack.",1,1763987563.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False
1p5ftrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeThoughts/comments/1p5ftrg/how_to_overcome_your_study_slump/,How to overcome your study slump,"Do you feel unmotivated lately? Too tired? Not feeling like studying today? Well, in some cases it might not be common laziness and procrastination. You might be deep in a study slump! Don’t beat yourself unnecessary, it’s completely normal and happens even to the nerdiest of nerds. Still, you need some way out of it. Here are a few tips that should help.

# Consider taking a break

It might sound counterintuitive but sometimes forcing yourself to work harder just won’t cut it. Your brain is probably overwhelmed and that’s why it refuses to focus properly, looking desperately for any distraction. Distract yourself deliberately then! Plan a whole weekend in a spa, a tourist trip or visit your family. Change your environment completely and give your poor brain a chance to unwire.

# Consider your daily habits

It’s possible that your daily habits and bad diet are contributing to your general feeling of “slumpiness.” Do you feel tired the moment you wake up? Then you’re doing something wrong. Do you get enough sleep? Remember that the brain stores memories when sleeping. Also, certain kinds of food and overeating can make you feel like a sloth. Review your day-to-day habits!

# Consider having an accountability partner

Sometimes all it takes is someone we can be accountable to. Especially when your study slump is partly connected to procrastination, you really need someone who would check up on you and motivate you. Ideally, it should be your study partner, your classmate or a tutor. I guess you could try asking your Mom, but… you know.

# Consider changing your routine

Maybe your life is just too monotonous! If you get up, always have the same boring toasts for breakfast each morning, go for lectures and then study in the evening, it inevitably gets hellishly boring. Do something differently! Visit that cosy coffee shop for your breakfast, study in the library instead of your cramped dormitory room or take your book to the park. Buy a celebratory meal each Friday and enjoy it without regrets. Whatever that breaks that routine.",1,1763987492.0,CoffeeThoughts,0,1.0,False

So last weekend I was at his flat and he was in the shower. His phone buzzed on the coffee table and I glanced at it. Not snooping, it was just RIGHT there and the screen lit up.

The notification was from Instagram but the account name wasn't his normal one. It was like a finsta type thing. I didn't even know he had one.

When he got out I asked about it casually. Tried not to sound accusatory. He got weird immediately. Said it was just an old account he barely uses.

I couldn't stop thinking about it. I know this is bad but I looked it up later. Found it. It's private but I could see who he follows and who follows him.

His ex Fiona is one of like 40 followers. And he follows her back.

I asked to see it. Told him if it's nothing then just show me. He got defensive but eventually let me scroll through.

It's not nothing.

They comment on each other's stuff constantly. Heart emojis. ""miss you"" under a sunset photo. Inside jokes I don't understand. She called him a nickname I've never heard. He replied with 😘.

When I got upset he said I was ""overreacting"" and that they're ""just friends now."" Said I'm being insecure and that he's allowed to have friends. Said he didn't tell me about the account because he knew I'd ""make it weird.""

But like. Miss you?? Kiss emoji?? That's not normal friend behavior right?? Or am I actually crazy??

He says nothing physical has happened and I believe him I guess. But emotionally this feels like something. I just don't know what.

I work as a radiographer so I'm used to looking at things carefully and analyzing them. Maybe I'm overanalyzing this. But my gut says this isn't okay.

AITA for wanting him to either stop talking to her or let me see the account whenever I want?",13,1763987405.0,ComfortLevelPod,8,1.0,False

I'm 28F, engaged to Jordan 29M, we've been together for 3 years and living together for almost 2. Things were great until about 6 months ago. Maybe longer actually. Time blurs when you're frustrated.

Jordan's sister Kristen (26F) went through a bad breakup back in like April or May. Her ex kicked her out pretty suddenly and she needed somewhere to stay. Jordan offered our couch ""for a couple weeks"" until she figured things out.

That was 6 months ago.

She's still here. And it's not even the couch anymore. She's fully taken over our living room. There's a clothing rack in the corner. Her makeup stuff is spread across our coffee table. She hung FAIRY LIGHTS. Like it's her bedroom now.

I work as a wildlife rehabilitator which means my hours are weird and sometimes I come home exhausted at like 2pm wanting to just collapse on my couch and watch trash TV. Can't do that anymore because Kristen is always there. Usually on a video call with her friends or watching something on her laptop without headphones.

I've started eating dinner in our bedroom. Like I make food in my own kitchen and then carry it to my room so I don't have to sit awkwardly in the living room while she's doing whatever she's doing.

I talked to Jordan about setting a move-out date. Nothing mean, just like ""hey can we figure out a timeline."" He shut it down immediately. Said she's ""still going through a hard time"" and ""needs family support right now.""

It's been SIX MONTHS. I understand breakups are hard. I've had bad ones. But at some point you have to start putting your life back together right??

The worst part is she's not paying rent. Not even a little. Jordan says we can't ask her for money because ""she's struggling."" Okay but I'M struggling now. This is MY home too and I feel like a guest in it.

I don't even hate Kristen. Before this we got along fine. But I'm starting to resent her and I hate that feeling.

1p5fs1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LushCosmetics/comments/1p5fs1f/long_post_sorry_ust_tried_the_new_club_fragrances/,Long post (sorry!) ust tried the new club fragrances...,"I went to town this morning and my local store had all the sprays and perfumes out so I gave them all a good sniff.

Overall, I came away empty handed as none of them wowed me enough to buy them. They were fine but I wanted to be blown away by at least one of them and love it enough to buy on the spot and ultimately I didn't. I then came home and immediately went to smell my existing perfumes and sprays, 90% of which I absolutely love, no question! Cardamom Coffee, Tumeric Latte, I'm Home, Breath of God, Frangipani, Butterball, Fresh As - all absolutely elite fragrances that I already have and LOVE them all. It was a good reminder for me to love what you have and remember how excited I was to buy them, and not just because they were some sort of exclusive release but because I had adored them and genuinely wanted them for a while before purchasing. All (minus cinders and super milk) of what I already have sat in a dark draw is far far more beautiful to me than any I tried today. Just because these club ones are new, exclusive and nice this does not mean I need to buy any!  




Loooong notes below in case they are helpful!:

25:43 - I'd never tried this before and think I built this up in my head so much that I expected earth shattering beautiful, heavenly lemony bakery scent. It's definitely nice, it's lemony and does have a warm sweetness to it. The lemon and lemongrass makes it lighter and overall more citrussy than say Chelsea Morning, but 25:43 does still have a slight bakery warmth to it. Chelsea Morning is stronger, more butterscotch, sweeter and warmer. I'd describe CM as butterscotch first, lemon second. 25 I'd describe as lemon first with a hint of butterscotch on dry down. I was worried the Lemongrass would make it too sharp and cleaner like but it doesn't at all. It has none of the milky creaminess of the SM primer however. I do still prefer 25 to the Super Milk perfume which was a dud for me. I would say 25 seemed quite weak for a body spray but I only tried it on paper so take that with a pinch of salt given most body sprays from Lush are super strong. For a lemony body spray, to me Avocado Co-Wash is superior as it has such a fizzy effervescent to it. 

Snowcake - others here have given mixed opinions so I was quite unsure what to expect. It is very very almondy, pretty much pure almond. I am a huge huge almond fan, but having said that this did for me lack the creaminess and rounded scent of the classic Snowcake. Snowcake used to be so much more than just smack you in the face almond. Someone described it as the smell of almond extract that you use in baking and I totally agree. I was really disappointed as the snowcake I love isn't solely almond, so this did seem quite a one-dimensional downgrade. It did however get slightly better once it had settled so maybe its one I'll give another try if it sticks around in store. It's not horrible by any means and almond lovers might really enjoy this, but for those of us that know the old Snowcake, this could be a let down. 


Candy Rain - I am not a candy rain fan personally so this was never going to appeal to me, but having said that it does smell pretty much exactly like the hair conditioner to my nose and it was by far the strongest of the perfumes so people who like Candy Rain will hopefully be pleased with this.

Big Blue - along with Snowcake this was the one I was most excited for. The first spray was a bit disappointing as it was quite week and it has a slight powdery note that the bath bomb doesn't have to me. I sprayed this one on my skin and I will say that it does settle well on the skin and become truer to scent. It has the aquatic ocean like vibe but for me it slightly lacks the brightness and strength of the bath bomb. It's a more intimate skin scent, so people wanting lots of projection might be disappointed. I do still like it though and it is quite unique amongst Lush fragrances. 

Black Pearl: I didn't know this scent so was looking forward to trying it. It is lavender but not comparable to sleepy at all, it's much more herbal and complex, the blackcurrant comes through as it settles on the skin. Perhaps a gentler, sweeter, more wearable cousin of Junk or a less sweet, more complex cousin of the Comforter. It got better and sweeter after about an hour on my skin. The herbal notes die down slightly and the blackcurrant comes through a bit more but never too much. It's really well balanced. It's nowhere near as blackcurrenty sweet as the Comforter or No Way to Say Goodbye. I do actually really do like this not sure I love enough to buy, especially as it is very weak to my nose. 

Vimt-no: I would say this is the best one in terms of being true to scent (basma with a hint of grape soda) and its nice and strong but not too alcoholic. It's not the kind of scent I'd wear myself but I think people will be pleased with this one. I only sprayed this on paper but a couple of hours later it still smells strong. Really juicy and fruity.

We were just laying there talking about nerd stuff (board games, card tournaments, etc) and in walks an ex girlfriend of mine who sees us and is criticizing us and saying how my wife and I don’t need to be fawning all over each other in public. 

The conversation continues and then the ex girlfriend leaves but before she leaves she wants a hug so I reach in for one of those side hug things, and she responds by hugging me with both arms, nuzzling my neck, and making my wife and I very uncomfortable.

The ex leaves and I have the sudden urge to pee. So, I go to bathroom in the game store and the bathroom is in the middle of being remodeled. There’s no walls, just an old shower curtain and some tarp for privacy and weirdly enough the door lock is broken. I go into the “bathroom” which is right next to where a MTG tournament is going on and I can hear everything and they can also hear me as well.

One of the guys who is in the tournament is a cop dressed in full uniform. I’m standing there trying to pee and when the stream starts, I’m peeing blood, and I can’t aim properly for whatever reason so I just start peeing blood on the toilet, around the toilet, the floor, trashcan, everywhere. The cop actually opens the shower curtain and ask me why I’m peeing blood but by the tone in his voice I can tell he doesn’t really care he’s just worried that I made a mess. So I just told him I had kidney stones (which was a lie, I actually had no idea why I was peeing blood but for some reason I thought it was safer to give him an explanation).

You need to complete an important task for school. The problem is that you just can’t make yourself sit down to work.

You will start after making a cup of coffee. When you have your cup of coffee, you need to text your friend. Then you come across a funny video with cats. After that, you continue watching other videos. Just a short video about traveling to the Himalayas, right? That can’t hurt. When you finish your seventh tutorial on how to knit a pair of mittens, you realize you feel bad and guilty about not doing what you are supposed to be doing.

People tend to keep postponing things. It doesn’t have to be pure laziness. Fear or anxiety might be to blame too. It is as if there was an inner voice preventing you from taking a step forward. What if the essay doesn’t go so smoothly? What if I don’t come up with any interesting ideas? What if I won’t be able to solve the math problem? There are too many what-ifs haunting us. This is why we often procrastinate. It seems so difficult to get things done. At the same time, there are so many things that distract us. Let’s have a look at some tips that might help you.

# #1 Just start

It’s really important to start. If you start working on your task, there is a high probability of you continuing working on it. If you have to study for an exam, open your notes and your textbook. If you have an important essay to write, take your laptop, open the text editor, and write your first sentence. If you’re working on a school project, set off to the library and start doing your research. By starting, you have taken action. This helps you to get into a productive mood. The first step isn’t easy, but once you get there, you are on the right path to tackle your task.

# #2 Make a to-do list

There are so many tasks to do. Too many school subjects to study, too many goals to achieve, and too many essays to write. You might have a job too. We mustn’t forget the household chores that need to be done. Try to organize your tasks. It can help you to make a to-do list. It’s important to prioritize your tasks. Crossing out completed tasks from your list gives you a deep feeling of achievement.

It’s better to write a short list than a long one. A long list having an unrealistic number of to-do items can lead to frustration. You won’t be able to complete all the tasks. Instead, you will end up having a cluttered mind and feeling sad for not finishing what you have promised yourself to finish. If you make a short list, there is a higher probability you complete all your tasks.

# #3 Reward yourself for a job well done

If you complete a task, reward yourself. It can be just a small reward. The important thing is that the reward brings you joy. Watch an episode of your favorite show. Read a chapter in the book you’re currently reading. Have a piece of chocolate. Make yourself a coffee. Do whatever pleases you. You will be looking forward to this reward. This way you will have a strong motivation to get the job done.

 

It’s normal to postpone tasks. People are overloaded with them these days. Hopefully, these tips help you fight procrastination effectively. The important thing is to be proud of every single small achievement you make.",1,1763987149.0,LateLectures,0,1.0,False

Overall, my recovery has been smooth. I was of course sore around my incision sites, my partner helped me sit up/stand up, and I had to walk really slowly for 5 days. I felt every step. I could lay on my side comfortably around 6-7 days post op, and as a belly sleeper, I could finally lay on my belly around day 10.

The gas pain was really uncomfortable, no one here is exaggerating :D It lasted for maybe 4 days overall, however, it was only bad around the collarbones and especially as I leaned/reclined back more. Felt like someone was pushing a finger with all their strength into the hollow where my collarbone meets my shoulder.

I had no issue passing gas, nor going to the toiler and did not need to take stool softeners or laxatives. Instead, I opted for warm tea or very weak coffee in the morning. I also walked around every hour or so. Not long distance, but I just kept moving.

I started taking supplements immediately after coming home from the hospital (which was 1 day post-op for me), especially zinc, which is supposed to help with recovery. 

I also started taking cough drops immediately after the nurse cleared me for it after surgery to help the post-intubation sore throat and avoid coughing. However, I did cough quite a lot anyway. That was uncomfortable, but I tried my best to stabilize my belly.

I had no vaginal bleeding after my surgery.

I had normal stitches, which were taken out 7 days post-op. I had them covered in gauze and second-skin like foil (like for tattoos). I was instructed to not remove those. Then they took out the stitches after a week, that was pretty uncomfortable as well. I had bruising, and they have to pull up the stitch to cut it.... Yeah. I cringe just remembering that. The belly button was the worst. I would not say it was painful, but veeery uncomfy.

I could finally wash the wounds in the evening and was told I could gently wash it with chamomile tea. Of course the sites have to be kept dry, I'd let them air out before bed and pulled up my shirt throughout the day. 

While the wounds looked angry for a few days, and I was pretty scared of infection, all was well. I only have small scabs now and only my right side is still a little bruised. I am scheduled for a visit with my gyno next week.

TMI, but I was horny and tried masturbating (only externally) 10 days post-op. There was no pain, but many warn against this. I was very careful and if anything started hurting I would have stopped immediately. So if you try yourself, listen to your body.

I work from home, so I only took 2 days off and then worked half-days Thu-Fri. However, I would recommend taking at least a week of if you can.

After the disappointment of running triple Mclaren and have more points on my Costa Card than in my fantasy team, we arrive in the final sprint of the season. 

Qatar is one of those weekends that flips the Fantasy board on its head. A Sprint. A 25-lap mileage limit across *every* slick tyre. A left-front killer of a circuit. And a grid walking in with championship pressure on all three title contenders.

Here’s the simple version for Fantasy managers.

**• Mileage cap changes everything**  
Every slick set is capped at 25 laps. FP1, Sprint Quali, Sprint and the Grand Prix all count toward that total. There’s no room for long-run padding or burning tyres just to chase track evolution. Anyone who wastes mileage on Friday is compromised by Sunday.

**• Guaranteed multi-stop**  
Lusail already forces teams toward two-stop territory. The cap makes it a certainty. Medium becomes the race tyre. Hard becomes the anchor. Soft is a short tool. This brings strategy-driven risers into play.

**• McLaren might have to raise the ride height**  
The double DSQ in Vegas puts them under the microscope. If they lift the car, they lose their edge. That affects both qualifying pace and stint length. It’s relevant for anyone stacked with Norris/Piastri.

**• Verstappen walks in level on points and in form**  
 RB21 suits clear-load circuits. He’s the safest ceiling pick on the board and has improved 

**• Mercedes are the quiet threat**  
Lusail rewards restraint, and Russell/Antonelli fit that profile. Clean Sprint, clean Sunday, points on both days. Questions over engines in hot weather but in form.

**• Ferrari steady, not spectacular**  
Predictable temps help. Mileage discipline helps. They’re not boom-or-bust picks here and have been struggling.

**• Williams & Racing Bulls = value**  
Both manage mileage well. Both qualify well at medium-load tracks. If Saturday turns messy, they rise.

Throughout the week I’ll be posting the full breakdowns on Coffee Corner Motorsport — tyre allocations left per driver, compound availability for the Sprint and Grand Prix, and official notes as Pirelli send them through. If you want the deeper numbers, it’ll all be there. Let me know if you want them here as well. 

Good luck with your picks this week. Lusail tends to expose anyone who hasn’t done their homework.

1p5fjuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1p5fjuj/we_chose_comfort_over_community_now_were_paying/,We chose comfort over community. Now we're paying for it.,"Even when I grew up in the Netherlands in the 90's and early 2000's it already felt my grandparents talked about a different world they lived through during the 50's until the 80's.

Neighbors walked into each other's homes for coffee (used the backdoor, which was always open and unlocked). When a mother in the village died, the families living next door all adopted a kid. They just did it. When a farmer went almost bankrupt, the entire village helped out financially. People helped because they felt *obligated* to their community.

Somehow, I feel that this sense of community is completely gone now. Not only in the Netherlands, but more widely in the West, especially in urban areas (am I right?). Parents raise kids alone. If businesses struggle they just go bankrupt. Elders die in institutions. We pay strangers for everything that used to come from community: childcare, therapy, someone to talk to, feeling like you belong. 

Something just feels rotten in modern society. And I believe (please correct me if I am wrong) almost everyone can feel it too. 

I believe there is a decay of social fabric that has happened since the second world war.

This decay didn't happen slowly. We chose it. At every moment, we picked what felt easier right then. Not because we're bad people. Because a strong sense of community requires us to do things that feel slightly uncomfortable, and we simply prefer or chose not to:

* **Showing up uninvited feels intrusive.** It's easier to text ""let me know if you need anything"" (knowing they won't ask) than to actually show up with soup.
* **Asking for help feels like being a burden.** It's easier to hire a babysitter than ask the neighbor (what if they feel obligated? what if they say no? what if I owe them?).
* **Showing feelings feels vulnerable.** It's easier to talk about struggles with a therapist than with neighbours who you might see again.
* **Being watched feels judgmental.** It's easier to parent alone than have other adults watching your kids (and judging your choices).

My grandparents didn't have these options. The backdoor was unlocked. Neighbours watched your kids. People just walked in and out. You couldn't opt out without the whole street noticing.

**Was that oppressive? Maybe.**   
**Was it uncomfortable? Without doubt.**

But it also meant nobody ate dinner alone. Nobody died without being found for weeks. Nobody raised kids without help. My grandparents even talked about the fact that things like depression barely existed (accepting that diagnosing was also more difficult, but the same has been proven for diseases like cancer).

In the meantime we chose freedom from effort and got loneliness instead.

For most of human history, communities were not optional. You belonged because you were born into it. Extended family, neighbors, shared rituals, shared responsibilities, yet in modern society it feels optional. I think technology doesn't help. Because I can still feel I am helping but not put the real effort (i.e. text vs. soup).

Humans are inherently social creatures, but also try to get out of anything that requires effort, even if that leads to long term decay (same problem with burning fossil fuels; short term ease > human preservation).

We collectively decided that social control was oppressive. We celebrated independence as the ultimate virtue: ""You do you."" ""I don't owe anyone anything."" ""Mind your own business.""

Walk around any Western city now and see what this has gotten us: people won't give up seats for the elderly. Everyone avoids eye contact on trains. People step over homeless people. Parents hover at parks because they don't trust anyone else with their kids.

Not because people are bad. I believe very few are. But because the unspoken norms of collective responsibility vanished. Our social fabric has completely decayed.

Our grandparents weren't better people. They just lived inside a system that made helping each other normal. And now we're shocked that we're lonely and mentally sick. Can you have real community where social commitment is optional? Where people only help ""when they feel like it""?

I don't think so. I think it requires short term sacrifices to reap the long term reward.

Real community requires:

* Seeing the same faces every week for *years*
* Showing up even when you're busy or tired
* Your contributions being visible (and your absence noticed)
* Standards (free-riders destroy everything)
* Actual obligation, not just good vibes

Obligation is the part modern people hate, but it is not the same as oppression. It's the price of belonging. The ""freedom"" to disengage whenever you want isn't freedom. It's just isolation pretending to be independence.

When I look at the loneliness epidemic, the mental health crisis among young people, parents drowning, elders dying alone... I can't help but wonder what life would look like if we all decided to do more for each other. I think the world would be a much, much better place. What if the social fabric was strong and people prioritized the long term health of the community over themselves?

What if we just... did the awkward thing? Showed up uninvited. Asked for help. Let neighbors see our mess. Accepted the obligation. What if the problem isn't that we don't know how to fix this? What if the problem is that we do know, and we're just not willing to be uncomfortable?

Maybe the real work of this century isn't inventing new technology.  
Maybe it's rebuilding the social structures we accidentally destroyed.

Like if you just plug your phone in the other room and drink black coffee, suddenly you’ll enter monk mode and write 2,000 words or finally open that Excel sheet. But that’s not how it works. Most people around me, especially in high-pressure knowledge jobs, aren’t lazy. They’re operating with fried dopamine systems.

This post is for anyone who beats themselves up for being ""lazy"" or ""unmotivated"". It pulls together what neuroscience, behavior science, and elite performance research actually say about why focus feels so impossible today. Not the garbage you see in TikToks telling you to wake up at 5 am and take cold showers for hustle culture points.  

The truth? Focus isn’t willpower. It’s chemistry. And the good news is, you can \*train\* it. Here’s what actually works, backed by research from Stanford, Huberman Lab, Cal Newport, Gabor Maté, and more.

\- Dopamine is not just the ""pleasure"" chemical. It’s the motivation and \*anticipation\* chemical. Dr. Anna Lembke, psychiatrist at Stanford and author of \*Dopamine Nation\*, explains we don’t get addicted to outcomes, we get addicted to the \*chase\*. Every scroll on TikTok is a dopamine lottery ticket. Every tab switch is chasing tiny novelty hits. Which means your brain learns to \*expect\* stimulation every 30 seconds. No wonder a 20-minute task feels impossible.

\- If your brain is constantly stimulated by dopamine-overloading activities (YouTube shorts, IG reels, Reddit, junk food), your baseline dopamine level drops. This is called ""dopamine downregulation"". Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says this is one reason why normal tasks feel ""boring"" or even painful  because your brain’s reward system got hijacked by too much stimulation. Focus doesn’t feel good anymore because NOTHING feels good unless it’s hyper-stimulating.

\- The fix isn’t quitting dopamine. It’s \*resetting your sensitivity\*. This is why Huberman recommends a 30-day ‘dopamine fast’ not from everything, but from \*high-frequency novelty\*. It means: delay gratification, restrict short-term highs (social media, sugar binges, even background noise while working). Over time, your brain starts to ""upregulate"" its sensitivity again. Focus starts to \*feel\* rewarding again.

\- The 45/15 rule works better than Pomodoro. According to peak performance researcher Steven Kotler (\*The Art of Impossible\*), the brain needs about 20 minutes of uninterrupted effort to shift into flow state  not 5 like Pomodoro fans think. But after about 90 minutes, mental energy crashes. So he recommends working in 45-minute deep blocks with 15-minute low-dopamine breaks (walk, journal, silence). That gives you dopamine regulation \*and\* recovery.

\- Start your day with “dopamine discipline”. First 60 minutes are sacred. No dopamine flooding. No phone, no social scroll, not even checking email. Instead: sunlight, movement, hydration. This stacks your brain to \*earn\* dopamine through internal rewards. Dr. Paul Conti (Stanford psychiatrist) argues that external dopamine is cheap, but internal dopamine builds long-term drive.

\- Novelty is not always bad. You can \*harness\* dopamine for focus by mixing in “intermittent novelty”  change work locations, listen to new (non-lyrical) music, or introduce a competitive timer. Your brain loves surprises. Brain scans from the University College London show that unexpected rewards spike dopamine more than predictable ones. Just make sure the novelty supports, not distracts.

\- Your inputs shape your chemistry. Diet and sleep aren’t optional. Low tyrosine foods (dopamine precursor) and poor sleep reduce dopamine receptor sensitivity. Magnesium, omega-3s, and regular movement support better dopamine regulation. Multiple studies in \*Nature Neuroscience\* show that even mild sleep deprivation cuts focus by up to 40% and weakens impulse control.  

\- Context beats willpower. The environment controls your cognitive load. From \*Deep Work\* by Cal Newport: willpower burns out fast, so you need to ""design for discipline"". That means: no more than 1 tab open. Pre-block all temptations. Set up a visual cue for your main task (notion doc open, post-it on screen). And use tech tools like Cold Turkey or the Forest app to automate restraint.

Focus is not some moral high ground. It’s a neurochemical state your brain enters when the environment, timing, and rhythms align. We’ve just been trained by bad platforms and worse advice to destroy our ability to access it.

You’re not broken or too weak. You’re just overstimulated. But chemistry can be rebalanced. And when you rebuild your dopamine system with intention? Focus becomes fun again. Not a punishment.",4,1763986650.0,LockedInMan,0,0.75,False

One day, a coworker brought in a small cactus, and I watered it because it looked a bit sad. Fast forward a few weeks, and suddenly I’m the office *plant person*. Every time someone gets a new plant, it ends up on my desk. I’m the one people text if their plants look a little droopy. And when I water them, I get these little smiles of relief from my coworkers.

It’s kind of fun, actually. I never thought I’d care so much about a cactus, but now I feel like a proud parent. I’m starting to bond with these little plants, and it’s made the office feel a lot more homey. Who knew a few plants could do that?

Anyway, anyone else end up as the office “plant guru” or “coffee supplier” without even trying? I’m kinda digging this role, to be honest, but I’m open to hearing how you’ve all handled similar situations!",17,1763986526.0,CasualConversation,11,0.87,False
