I'm visiting Tokyo from the Inaka this weekend, and I have a few things I'd like to take care of, would anyone give me any recommendations for stores or places to go for this? Thank you very much in advance! 

1. I have an American Asus laptop that someone spilled coffee on. Our local repair service couldn't get it working, and I wonder, before I ship it off to Asus and pay them to fix it, if there isn't a good PC repair place in Tokyo I could try first. 

2. I'm hunting for some American/European toiletries, soaps, etc. Is there a store somewhere in Tokyo that carries these types of foreign goods? 

3. My beloved 50 inch TV has suddenly decided to retire, and so I need a replacement. I'm sure there's a bunch of places in Akihabara and elsewhere I could go to to get a used TV for cheap, but I thought I'd ask if anyone here has a shop recommendation, a place where you found the service and quality to be worth supporting. I'm interested in supporting local businesses, so I'm hoping to avoid the big chains like book/hard off or 2nd street.

1mjmbli,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjmbli,"Awkward living room layout, no idea how to style it","Recently moved into to a townhouse and have no clue how to style this living room. The tv stand in the pictures is just temporary until we figure out a layout. I am unsure whether to mount the TV, or get a nice TV stand, the problem is the positioning. The way the couch is arranged in pictures 3 & 4 make the living room feel bigger, but looks tacky in my opinion, and where the current tv stand is isn’t wide enough to fit a 75 inch TV that I’m going to order, even if mounted. The way the couch is arranged in the last set of photos (TV stand would be moved, not where it is currently) feels more natural, but is still a little awkward looking. I’m stuck on whether to mount the TV above the fire place (not sure what I’d do as far as location for Apple TV, game console etc), or put a nice stand in front of the window. 


And for coffee table, TV stand etc, what colors would you guys go with? White, oak, black, gray etc? 

Lastly, should I ditch the couch for something different? I’m not married to the idea of keeping it. Or could this couch work?

1mjmbld,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1mjmbld/found_chips_in_the_garbage/,found chips in the garbage,"when my brother was living at home a few years ago, he worked as a garbage man, which at one point in time was sort of considered a decent job, since it was a municipal/government job, working for the city. now everything is privatized and it's just as shitty as you would imagine. my brother was miserable working it but he was... uh... rough at the time and really, it wasn't beneath him. anyway, he used to bring home all sorts of stuff he found in the garbage. the only time i wondered if he had gone too far was when he brought home a 'bean boozled' game, still vacuum sealed and in good condition. if you're not familiar, 'bean boozled' is a game where you eat a jellybean and there's a chance of it being a normal flavour (orange, peach) or a gross flavour (ear wax, vomit). thing is, when you find it in the garbage, even if it's still vacuum sealed and completely in-tact, you kind of wonder 'is this really a gross flavour or am i tasting garbage?'

i really have no pride, garbage doesn't put me off. i don't seek it out, but if there's an opportunity to use something there's no good reason should be thrown away, i'll take it. today at work, i arrived a half our early because i like to take my time getting all set for the day. i finished my coffee, and when i went to throw away the cup, i happened to notice that the contents of one garbage bin were, from all visible aspects, just bags of chips. still perfectly sealed, in a layer of their own and possibly all the way down to the bottom of the bag. so, not touching actual garbage.

putting two and two together, i saw what must have happened: the vending machines next to the garbage were being re-stocked or cleaned and whoever did it had just thrown the expired bags of chips in the garbage. chips, as far as i'm concerned, don't expire. did i take a bunch of chips? yes. obviously. of course i did.  in what scenario would i not take the chips?",1,1754528484.0,BenignExistence,0,1.0,False
1mjmbg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wednesday/comments/1mjmbg8/thoughts_so_far_that_i_hope_part_2_addresses/,Thoughts so far that I hope part 2 addresses,"I just wrote a big rambly comment so I thought I’d make my own post to share my thoughts and views so far. 

First off, this feels like an entirely different town and school to me so far. The new quad and direction and the coffee thing in the corner? Gives a completely different vibe. Also where the hell are the vampires? Idk. It felt like they were giving Nevermore a very typical high school feel vibe and it was odd. I don’t know how I feel about it. 

Jericho doesn’t feel like it’s a tiny town in the middle of butt heck nowhere anymore. In s1 I’m sure it became established that Jericho essentially was tiny, had a small ass sheriffs department, had f all money and pilgrim world employed half the town or something and I thought it was also mentioned they allow Nevermore and outcasts bc the town needs the money the school provides? I didn’t get the vibe this would be a town that has some weird summer camp that’s apparently so popular it can get double booked? 

Speaking of double booking, the capture the flag moment. Was completely unnecessary and distracting from what I actually cared about, for me personally. Worst part of the second season so far. 

I don’t feel like Wednesday has developed as a character, at all. 

I thought she’d get back to Nevermore and she’d have grown from last year but alas nope. I thought she’d grow to value her friends, even if she show ed it in a weird Wednesday fashion. She’d appreciate them and their unique skills and we’d see her teaming up with them in unique ways. I especially thought that would be the vibe when Bianca came and told all the new kids to leave Wednesday alone. But that vibe just never continued? 

Eugene has been completely cast to the side for the Pugsley B Plot. Even though she went off onto a trek into the woods where Eugene would have been the perfect character to call on for his old Boy Scout stuff. But nah. Not even a thought at him.  Ajax only existed for Enid to push aside, now he’s doing something with Bianca for a bit, Enid is obsessing over the new wolf guy (whose name I’ve forgotten he was so bland) but Wednesday isn’t really involving her, that I agree with Enid on. She’s using this new Agnes person for convenience but that’s it. Xavier is obviously not around. 

I really want to know what the show would have been had Xavier not been written out. It feels like he was meant to be a driving force for Wednesday to grow and change and they had to change the script. I feel like she would have used the phone he gave her. Albeit begrudgingly everytime bc “Slave to technology” but I feel like she’s smart enough to realise when and where it can be useful. 

I feel like there was a lot of cuts and a lot of re writes so far. 

I don’t care for a single thing Pugsley is doing, I just don’t care about him being around at all. IMO he’s one of the weaker links in the show and whereas it’s cool he’s inherited the family’s’ power. Putting him with Eugene and those two doing their own thing with the zombie hasn’t done him any favours as a character. If anything I’d prefer he was a side character who’s just at the school now and Wednesday calls on him when she needs him for something. 

I also don’t particularly care for Morticia and Gomez being around constantly. The show is meant to be about Wednesday. Not the whole Addams family. There is far too much focus on the frought mother daughter relationship for me atm and they have a weak reason to be sticking around the school for a fund raiser. I love them as characters but last season where they had their own episode almost that fit into the mystery was perfect. 

So far I think Fester has been the perfect addition in s1 and 2. He shows up for a hare brained scheme that only he could pull off to help his niece and he disappears. He’s never outstayed his welcome for me. 

Morticia’s mum has confused me, as a life long Addams family fan. I can appreciate that Grandmama is meant to be Gomez and Fester’s mother but the creator caused confusion by originally calling her Granny Frump and the tv shows and films often had her as Morticia’s mum. That’s fine. But she was also an insane witch batty old woman her characterisation here was far from what we’re used to in the older tv shows and films. It didn’t seem to be the same character at all, which is odd when all the others have fitted so well to their classic counterparts. Although I can appreciate a fabulous older women and I did like her character, it wasn’t Grandmama. 

The new principal is kinda goofy and trying to pull off being sinister with Bianca but it just ain’t cutting the mustard. Weems was perfect was a principal that you’re not sure what side they’re on and they’re just serious and fabulous enough you can believe them in their role and place in the school. This new guy just ain’t it for me. 

What the fuck are davinci’s? They’re just throwing a thousand outcast powers at us with no real explanation or background and the vampires have retreated to their coffins it seems. 

There’s far too many b plots that don’t seem to fit into the main plot that I just don’t care about personally, Bianca’s mum, the fundraising angle, Enid’s love life, Pugsleys stuff. I dunno. 

I think they’re spinning far too many plates with plot lines and I can’t see where this is going. It doesn’t feel cohesive or the same location or even the same tv show at times personally. The characters all feel different. Like not I’ve spent a summer growing up different. Like some feel like entirely new people. The chemistry and magic isn’t there for me so far sadly. I’m interested to see where this goes but I feel like they’re fumbled some very solid foundations from last season.  I’m interested to see if part 2 can cohesively and satisfyingly show how all these pieces fit together though. ",3,1754528474.0,Wednesday,1,1.0,False

I am not letting myself spend quite as much time going over what I've written before I start because I find that I am getting distracted by the temptation to edit. I get more done if I allow myself to read no more than a paragraph back from where I left off. The editing can wait until the second draft. I'm sure this section is going to need a lot of work. But, it also needs to be finished first.

I also wrote 424 word of short story nonsense like I told you I anted to. Just pits of daydreams and such that often retell myself over and over, fragmentary on the document as it is. It was just something to do. I will probably make a habit of it. That document will be like a sketch book for stories; messy and made for practice instead of perfection. I am probably going to buy my watercolour paper soon so maybe I'll scrawl a few pieces of story onto whatever I paint as well.

I don't have anything else to tell you. The garden is well. A few robins and finches visited the yard. No bunnies so far but they often hop in for a snack at night. It's steadily getting hotter everyday so we'll see if tomorrow is too much for me. I am, as you would expect, going to relax with my evening coffee.

He said you guys would understand.*   

\---

This is fun, I’m writing my own post.

I came to visit Mack in his study after I heard the printer whirl up.  When the printer whirls up it means he’s finished his deadline.  So I brought him a coffee because that’s what I do.

We’re both unwinding after our big city getaway.  While we were sitting here, he showed me the posts he wrote from the city and I asked if he was going to post another now that we’re home.  He said not right now, but then told me that I should.  He was being cheeky. 

Challenge accepted.

So now he’s sitting in my chair and I’m sitting in his.  He’s reading work stuff as I type.  I like these times.

We had a wonderful time and I loved it.  I didn’t think I would.  It started out a little sketchy when we got to the apartment I rented.   It was so tiny, I felt so bad.  But when I looked at Mack, he was happy.  This is huge! He said.  It had a kitchen in a closet with these floppy doors and you could close it off.  The bed came down from the wall but you had to move a table first.  But Mack told me it was a typical New York apartment and that it was great.  It was actually really nice, just small.  After a day or two, it really was fun.

It was in a really amazing part of town where he used to live with the Metropolitan Museum of Art at the end of the street and the Duke house that Mack says is his favorite since he was like five.  He said he always wanted to live in it when he was a boy.  I asked him if he still does and he said no.  But he still loves it.  I’ll have to make a link to it.

(several minutes later)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin\_N.\_Duke\_House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_N._Duke_House)

It is a wonderful city filled with amazing people and places.  Mack always said it was the whole world and that makes sense to me now.  There is a waiter at one of the places he goes to that we met and he’s in his 60’s now.  Mack has known him forever.  He has never left the island of Manhattan.  I asked him if he was serious and he said he was.  He asked why he would need to go anywhere when everything is there.  That was very strange to me but I didn’t say it.

We went to Mack’s home town in the outskirts and it was very different from what I imagined.  Suzie always spoke well of it and enjoyed visiting.  A lot of people Mack went to school with are still there.  I asked Mack why he left and all he said was “I wanted more.”  I’m really glad he left. 

I know this is really weird for me to say but he had a song with Suzie and I couldn’t stop hearing it when we were there.  She always told me how they danced to it on their second date.  Suzie was from Jersey.  I know it’s strange, but I told Mack that it was playing in my head the whole time we were in his old neighborhood.  It starts “I got no time for the corner boys, down on the street making all that noise.”  I couldn’t get it out of my head because when we visited, we met the real corner boys.  It came to life for me.  Wait, I’ll have to make a link to it.

Mack just looked up at me when the song played for a just a second as I clipped the link.  He asked me what I could possibly need that song for and I told him to hush.  This is my post.

Well, I just assured that this will not be posted to his blog thing but it can still be my journal.  I’m enjoying journaling.

I feel more a part of him after a week in his world.  He shared the spaces with me and the memories and I learned a lot.  It’s so interesting.  It’s really authentic for lack of a better word.  I’m from outside of Boston and it’s not the same, it isn’t even close.  By comparison, my town is quiet and boring.

He’s different in the city though.  Mack is always sweet and gentle, but he was so rushed when we were out and he was short with people and that’s so strange to me.  At the same time, he took such good care of me.  He was so sweet to me.  I guess I saw what he calls City Mack.  I like Farm Mack better and I told him that. 

The best part was coming home and Mack said so himself.  Dan’s car was in the driveway but we drove around to the yard and he did that on purpose.  He does it all the time.  That’s where you get greeted with chickens and teenagers.  He couldn’t wait to see the boys.

He asked them what Dan was doing here and PJ said “He’s keeping us out of the papers.”  I suppose that could be translated to he’s keeping them out of trouble.  At their age (they’re not little kids), we didn’t ask Dan to look in on them but neither of us were surprised that he did.  He made them dinner more than a few times.  He had dinner for us.

I was glad Dan was here and we had a really nice time telling him about the things we did.  Danny doesn’t like the city the way Mack does.  Mack always found that strange because Danny grew up in a city.  He said Bondy (where he grew up) was Sydney’s answer to Queens, but Dan says it’s different.  He would know.

I watched Mack and Dan sitting at the table together.  Mack rested his hand on Dan’s shoulder as they talked and they were just being them.  They’re like brothers.  I thought maybe Mack might leave me for the bright lights but I know he’ll never leave Dan ..LOL  (he won’t leave me)

I did ask that big question as we were driving home.  Would he be happier if he was back on 82^(nd) Street?  He told me absolutely not.  He told me that we all belong in the place where we’re loved.  Then he said he learned a lot about me this week too.  I asked him what, and he hesitated.  Then he said it was best that I remain an out-of-towner.  We laughed.  But we’ll unpack that later.  LOL it will be one of those “what did you mean by that” moments he hates so much.

I think for a long time Mack truly missed the city and I know the farm wasn’t a choice he would have made.  And I know for a long time he used humor to make up the difference, even with Suzie.  His complaining was a lot about a loving banter, it was how they teased, but I think there was some truth to it.  But I believe him now when he says he’s happy here.  You would too if you had to see him, after we were home, when he stepped up to the fence rail and called for Gene Kelly.  “Hey Bull!!  Hey you old fat bastard!”  Gene isn’t very elegant, but at the sound of Mack’s voice, he lumbered quick as he could.  Mack scratched him as Gene twisted his head to expose that one spot he needed itched the most.  That was a really nice moment.  He loves the animals.

Mack left me alone here a short while ago but I can hear him debating with Jon-Jon over something.  I think I’d have to be a poet to describe their relationship.  As a mom, all I know is that Jon needed him.  And he’s safe now. 

It was a good trip.  And maybe Mack will share the autopsy with me … wait … that’s not what he calls it.  (I just shouted out asking what he calls it)  “The postmortem.”  Maybe he will share the postmortem with me, because I know he’s already written it. 

It was a good trip.  But I think we’re both glad to be home.",4,1754527886.0,FathersJourney,0,1.0,False
1mjm2gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1mjm2gx/the_weirdest_unexplainable_things_always_happen/,"The weirdest, unexplainable things always happen in my house","On October 2024 I bought my house, technically a townhouse. Cool little 2 bed, 3 bath double garage townhouse. Everyone gets along, relaxed HOA, gated etc. 

When I came to see the house everything looked normal besides the fact all appliances were original to 1989. To be honest, it looked like no one had lived in it for decades. The county recorded the deed late afternoon and considering I was staying with my parents I drove that same day to the house and stayed overnight to clean. Immediately the house felt ""cold"", creepy in a way? I can't explain it but at the time I thought it was just a new place and it was expected. 

Over the months so much has happened but it had always been things that you can't quite prove it wasnt normal. Loud noises, doors being shut when you leave, opened when you return and so on. Things that make you think ""wait did i..?"" Still, theres that 00.1% chance it might be been you. Until theres no reasonable explanation.. 

Tapping on the bedroom door at 3am. You open the door at 12am because you feel thirsty and want to get water but the SECOND you open the door you hear footsteps running and shushing downstairs. ""Someone broke in"" so you go searching the house. Until eventually after so many times reality sets in and you start thinking ""okay maybe I dont need to go outside till morning"" then you accept its your new reality and you coexist with these occurrences. 

Random sticky ""goo"" footsteps on the stairs, objects missing just to turn up a day or two later in the randomest, plain view places. 

A room that THE SECOND you cross the door frame you feel the + 10 degree change and no amount of windows opened or window AC units seem to cool down the room. 

Like i said, ive accepted reality at this point and perfectly coexist. Ive found ways to minimize occurrences. Ive removed multiple doors including the downstairs bathroom, both bedroom doors, upstairs bathroom. No more doors shutting and opening on their own, no footsteps running and shushing the second I open the door, the tapping on the bedroom door at 3am. The banging is still there but its just another Tuesday afternoon. 

Sometimes though I feel violated, like last night. Theres something about being touched while youre unaware that fucks with your head. I have to clock in by 5:30am so I slept fairly early. I wake up at 4:20 where I race to go eat, get dressed, prep my food etc. I woke up, go get greek yogurt and it gets on my lips right? I lick my lips and I get this intense chemically taste. More than that, I notice my lips are smooth like plastic but last night I went to sleep with chapped lips. I try to forget about it and keep eating, again, I lick my lips again and its all over them. I go for my pre-made coffee jar I left on the countertop (ew old coffee blah blah blah) and its covered in this oily residue. Not like dripping but theres a visible difference in the glass from where theres oil on it.

I’m a 33M who’s been living in Pittsburgh for almost two years now. Stuck working on projects all day and reading papers late into the night, my social life has mostly been Slack pings, meeting invites, and the barista who knows my drink by heart. With a few sweet weeks of summer left, I’d love to meet some new people to hang out with and explore the city.

Quick snapshot of me:

* Gaming (anything goes): play any fun games, mostly here for good company and laughs when the academic grind gets real. 
* Court (and field) sports for fun: Any spot with a racket: tennis, pickleball, racquetball, or a pitch for some casual soccer. I’m ok-ish, nowhere near pro, and always up for a friendly rally or laid-back doubles.
* Food & café crawling: Lately I’ve been on a mission to discover new restaurants, cafés, and dessert spots around Pittsburgh,especially  bakeries or coffee drinks. If you’ve been eyeing a place, count me in.
* Other interests: Exploring new cultures, picking up new languages, collecting off-beat facts, and pretending I understand jazz.

What I’m hoping for this summer: 

* Chill voice/text chats to unwind after lab hours. 
* Court buddies for tennis, pickleball, or racquetball, or even a quick round of soccer.
* Partners-in-crime for restaurant/café/dessert missions, museum trips, or spontaneous day hikes before the semester chews us up.

If any of that clicks, drop a comment or DM. Happy to move the convo to Discord. 

Everyone’s welcome; just be kind and curious. :)",3,1754527750.0,PittsburghSocialClub,0,1.0,False

But you have to understand: I’m a physicist, not a barista, so it’s not like I know everything about coffee. Sure, after nearly a month doing the same thing, I *should* be at least slightly less terrible at making a simple espresso, but this job is terrifying in itself.

*Would you like ice, sir? Whole milk or soy, ma’am? Cash or card?*

And on top of that, I’m expected to be cheerful while going through a slow and excruciating six-hour torture session every day. Okay, maybe I should be more grateful to have landed a job so quickly after being kicked out of a prestigious position at Michigan State University.

For five long years, I devoted a good part of my life to the aspiring theoretical physicists of Michigan. Even though the university was about an hour’s drive from my home, it was still what I truly loved doing until I got fired for being late.

And don’t think it was just once or twice, three whole weeks without even showing up at the university. I still don’t understand how they managed to manipulate the system and log that many absences when I was, in fact, still going to work.

**That’s why I’m only writing this now.**

Patrícia (my wife) and I don’t really have the ritual of always going to bed at the same time. She’s also a teacher, but she works with preschoolers. And I must say, she’s the best. When she’s not at school, she’s researching more playful and pedagogical ways to engage her students. Many times, she takes a while to go to bed because she gets so immersed in a project that she won’t close her laptop until it’s done. At the beginning of the month, I had a dream I thought I’d forgotten the moment I woke up. It started with me or at least I assumed it was me, since I didn’t actually see my facein our living room on an afternoon when I clearly should’ve been at the university.

Then I walk toward the kitchen, which is separated from the living room only by the countertop my wife’s pride and joy, her open-concept kitchen. I go to the sink, grab a glass, fill it with water, and turn back toward the living room but this time I turn to the stairs that sit between the two rooms. I start walking up, and then the dream ends.

I don’t remember if I had another dream after that, or if I just kept sleeping without dreaming at all. Like I said, it was a pretty forgettable and ordinary dream. What made me remember it was the next night another dream, the same setting. I’m standing in the living room, facing the stairs, the front door behind me. I walk to the kitchen, grab a glass, water, and then head upstairs.

This time, I make it to the top but instead of finding the hallway with four doors, I see the stairs again. The living room to my right, the kitchen to my left. But in the kitchen

In the kitchen, there’s a tall Black man standing with his back to me. He turns around, and I see - **it’s me**. It’s me, walking toward the stairs and going up. I start to follow him, climbing the stairs behind him. But then he stops and starts to turn his head, slowly, until his eyes meet mine. And I wake up with a jolt. You know that feeling when you’re dreaming that you’re falling into a hole and you suddenly jump awake? Or when you're falling and your legs kick forward on their own? It was exactly like that. Except when I woke up, I *felt* something grab my ankle. I opened my eyes to see the silhouette of my wife in front of me, holding my leg.

  
**- What is it, sweetheart? A nightmare?**  
Patrícia asked, her hand resting gently on my leg.

**- No, I think I just got startled when you touched me**  
I replied with a shy laugh.

**- Well, I just got here. You were already awake, sitting there in the dark.**

**- Really? It felt like I’d just woken up.-**

**- When I came to talk to you and finally saw your face, you gasped and looked at me strangely. It must’ve been a nightmare, my love. I’m going to the bathroom, and then I’ll come to bed.**  
she said, giving me a gentle kiss on the forehead.

  
Honestly, I didn’t take it very seriously at first. I thought I was just too sleepy to remember what Patrícia had told me and ignored it. Then, later that same week, I had the exact same dream again no changes, just the same damn glass of water in my hand, climbing the stairs. The dream felt so real I could feel the cold wood of the steps beneath my feet. Maybe I was wrong to say “no changes.” Technically, nothing *did* change, but hear me out, you’ll understand.

There I was, climbing the cold stairs with the glass in my hand, my eyes fixed, alternating between the glass and the stairs ahead, careful not to spill a single drop or trip. Then I felt a presence. You know that feeling when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and you’re certain there’s something lurking in the dark corner of the hallway? Even though you tell yourself there’s nothing there, you still hurry back to your room and lock the door? That tightness in your chest, that chill at the back of your neck—that’s exactly what I felt. Only this time, I could feel the stairs slowly tilting downward beneath my weight and the weight behind me.

I thought about just keeping on and ignoring it, but before I knew it, I was turning my head and body backward to find out what was following me up the stairs.

And that’s it. the dream ends, and I don’t know what I saw next. Maybe I had another dream afterward, but I really can’t remember. Like I said, it was pretty forgettable, if not for the recurring details. After all, who dreams and then continues the same dream the next day?

I haven’t even gotten to the reason why I’m writing this. It wasn’t the dream that scared me, nor was it a nightmare. The truth is, after that day, I never had that dream again, only a string of strange days and unexplained dreams.

But what made me come to you and ask for help was what happened last night.

I had just woken up, but it was already night again. A faint, bluish light filtered through the crack in the curtain, from the window to my right. I imagine it was from a street lamp or the moon. I could be more certain if I could at least turn over, but all I could see was my slightly dirty ceiling and some cobwebs in the left corner.

**- Honey? \_** I whisper, glancing at my wife, who’s breathing heavily in a deep sleep beside me.

By now, the most sensible thing would be to try to fall back asleep. But before I can finish that thought, I hear the creak of the bedroom door in front of me. A chill runs through my body as I imagine a burglar stepping into the room while I’m unable to move, possibly attacking my beautiful wife as I watch helplessly, like some cruel joke. Then I realize my arms are raised, stretched out, and my legs slightly apart, also stretched. I manage to move my head down and see, through the open bedroom door, the bathroom light on at the other end of the hallway. Patrícia is brushing her teeth, wearing a pink floral pajama and her hair tied up in a lazy bun.

I could finally breathe a sigh of relief, if it weren’t for the deep breathing of my wife sleeping beside me. I slowly turn my face, and there she is, in her pink floral pajamas, a red curl falling across her face, now turned toward me. Almost like a whisper, I feel a weight pressing down on me. She’s on top of me, holding my arms, her knees pressing against my legs. Her face, which just minutes ago was the most beautiful I’d ever seen, now stared back at me with ridiculously huge, wide-open eyes, and an unnaturally open mouth almost as if she could swallow my entire head if she tried. The more I stared, the wider her mouth opened, and her head tilted back as her jaw adjusted to the size of my skull. I tried to scream. I tried to move. A terror rose up my throat and my body burned with heat. When I finally thought I might be able to move, it was already morning, and Patrícia was no longer by my side. I looked at the clock.

it was 4 PM.

Was it a dream? How the hell did I manage to sleep until the afternoon? Patrícia leaves before me; she couldn’t have woken me up. By now, I had already missed all my classes for the day, so I just packed my things for the next day. 

So the next day, I went to the university for another day of classes, just to face those semi-drunk young faces at 7 AM, apparently, there had been a party the night before. I started the roll call as usual, while rummaging through my bag for the folder with that day’s tests, my eyes shifting between the attendance sheet with all 21 names, my classroom with a little over 15 students, and my seemingly bottomless bag where I couldn’t find that damn folder. At one point, I thought I had left it at home, but finally, I found it and could continue with the roll call.

\- Philipe Martin, *I think I put my name in the wrong spot\_*

**- Here!**  
A young man who looked just like me, sitting in the second desk of the front row, raised his hand.

I could have sworn I was looking at myself sitting right in front of me when he decided to stand up and walk toward me.

**- I think you should pay more attention to who you let into your house,**  
the other Phil said.

And once again, I was staring at the same slightly dirty ceiling with cobwebs. But this time, my wife wasn’t beside me, and I could hear someone climbing the stairs. The bedroom door was already open, and the bathroom light was the only source of illumination spilling into the room. Maybe I would have preferred total darkness, because all I could see was a tall, dark silhouette coming down the stairs, backlit by the light. The figure finally stopped, standing straight and still in the hallway. *Am I dreaming?* I thought as it slowly crouched down, tilting its head to the side like a dog trying to understand a command. Then it got down on all fours and started crawling toward me, lifting one limb after another like something out of an old cartoon. Each movement was accompanied by creaks, and it moved slowly, as if its joints were extremely stiff. Finally, it reached the edge of my bed, placed what looked like an arm on it, and slowly climbed up, bringing the other limbs after it. Cold sweat was beginning to form on my forehead.

*Alright, I’m a man of science, this can’t be really happening*, I told myself as I squeezed my eyes shut, only to open them again and come face to face with a humanoid face, its eyes wide open and mouth excruciatingly stretched, revealing absolute darkness inside that slimy, fetid hole. It let out a hoarse growl. My whole body tingled with numbness, and just when I thought I was about to pee myself, I heard the bedroom door slam shut and darkness engulf the room.

*This was the end.*

Terror shook every particle of my body, forcing me to scream in fear, until my wife turned on the light and rushed to my side, worried, asking what had happened.

*Thank God, she was here. It was all just a nightmare.*

Before I could regain my senses and finally feel my limbs again, she turned to me and said:

**- You should pay more attention to who you let into your house, Phil.** \_ As she opened a wide, exaggerated smile.

Now I’m awake, I think, sitting in the living room while I write this to you. It’s 4 PM and my wife still hasn’t come home. I’m waiting for her. I don’t remember if I went to the coffe yesterday, but today my shift is already over. Honestly, I don’t know what’s happening, but after some research, I saw it might be sleep paralysis , though I’m not sure. Can someone please help me?

Dad! I watched a commercial about a video game and I want it!”, “oh? What game might that be?”, “sonic the hedgehog!”, Robert stops as he remembers about that game as he nods, “sure kido i’ll take you in like an hour or so when the game is actually out”, Alan left and hopped onto his old laptop and watched videos until he saw a website advertised, about a optical Sega Genesis as it said free on it as Alan being a kid and wanting to play sonic he immediately remembered the address of his own home and put it in as the thing asked one question… “do you want to be my FRIEND?”, Alan stared at the screen as he didn’t know what to do so he just clicked yes to not be mean as the website said predicament day at night at 1am, Alan was happy as later that day his dad would take him to a store and they would just buy sonic the hedgehog, but not the console but Alan remember the website thing as he just had to wait at night, within that night Alan walked out of his bedroom and wait at the front door for almost an hour, as he heard a knock as Alan opens the door and looks down and sees a box… as he picks it up and goes inside closing the door behind him, Alan made his way to his room and closed the door and opened the box… inside of it was a Sega Genesis but it’s colour was a different shade then the original ones his friends were talking about but he just thought he could’ve gotten lucky and gotten a newest version just for himself, Alan plugged it in and put the cartridge inside as he turns on his mini tv and sees the title screen, Alan started playing hill zone act?, Alan we’re sure he thought that it was Greenhill zone act1, then again he forgets a lot of things (mostly), Alan plays as the blue hedgehog on screen moves around with his controls until the game makes a loud sound before fading into a black screen, the words of “Do you remember me?”, two options appeared ‘yes’ or ‘no’, Alan tries to remember desperately as he couldn’t as he clicked on no, “aw… what a shame how about I jog your memory?”, the tv cracks as Alan backs away until a glove hand came out out of the TV and grabbed him by his face in a second and all Alan felt… was a sharp pain before everything went black, the next morning Robert went into his son’s room and sees his kid (Alan) dead on the floor his neck snapped a full 180, Robert quickly calls the police as the cops arrive to see a crying dad holding his kids body and a broken TV in the same room as they took the body away as they took Robert for an interrogation, “so tell me what happened yesterday or today that could’ve caused this to happen, Mr Robert”, “m-my son was alive… heathly and well, I took him to go get sonic the hedgehog yesterday but I never got the console”, the officer stops, “wait that could be a clue. There’s a console in the room where you were in sir”, the officers quickly get up and examine the console, after a long while the only trace the officers can find is a white glove that looked way too small for an adult… years have past as Robert got sonic 2 as he played it… knowing his son would have loved it as Robert turns off the console for the night and sleeps, 

Meanwhile…. Alan wakes up his head hurting and neck itchy as he gets up and stands his legs wobbly as he looks around, he sees a lot of green things, water and a clear sky as it reminded him of sonic the hedgehog, as he gets up and looks down and jumps, his body was of yellow fur and he had 2 tails which he thought was pretty cool as he made his way into zone……

…tails(Alan) would walk into hill zone once more as Alan looks around intrigued by everything his childish mentality enjoying the bright colours as he ran though the green hill zone until he tripped and felt a sharp pain of remembrance… a few years ago he died by a hand, Alan breathes as he kept running until he stops and sees his favourite character, sonic!(it ain’t him though), Alan would walk over until he heard loud wet snaps as he stops and sees his idol eating a little flicky as the sonic turns and faces Alan as he backs away a bit scared, “don’t be afraid my dear friend I’m YOUR friend after all”, Alan stops and remembers about the website asking to be friends, “w-wait that was you who was asking to be my friend?”, “yes it was Now then.. how about we play a game of tag?, Alan perked up “tag? I LOVE TAG”, “get a head start fox”, Alan realizes he’s in a body of a fox. But it didn’t bother him as he started to run as he heard static and everything became quiet as he hears “TIMES UP”, as he runs faster Alan takes a look behind him and sees the sonic slowly catching up to him until he felt a needle stab him in the leg as he trips over crying a bit as the sonic appears right in front of him grabbing Alan’s (tails) and slowly start to pull on his lower and upper half, “A-AH S-STOP-“, Alan felt an excruciating pain after his body was split in half as everything one black once more, Alan? Wakes up feeling a bit lost as he could barely remember anything, Alan gets up And feels a sense of pain through him, he started to cry and scratch his neck feeling aburning itch until an entire hand, comes out of he’s throat and snaps his neck and wants more leaving him in darkness, “your my FRIEND now we will always play my game, every single day you wake up”, the next day Robert gets up and turns on the Sega Genesis to play sonic 2 until he stops and watches how tails is getting choked out by his own best friend sonic until the hedgehog opens his mouth as a fucking tentacle comes out and stabs the tails as he hears screams from the poor fox as it slowly decays into dust, as the screen turns black for a moment before saying, “your not meant to be here… Robert..”, and the screen switches to an anti-pirates screen, as Robert did not hesitate and immediately called the police, meanwhile tails (Alan’s soul), falls onto the floor as he feels his head hurting as he got up wondering how many times has he died? To the point he can’t even remember who he is, tails walks into scrap brain zone and walks until he felt the floor under him break and he screams feeling his body painfully and slowly withered away in a black substance, years have past as tails has dead over 8981 times his body always being regenerated back, tails always tries desperately to win a game and to escape, but he always fails anyways, he fell to the floor as the sonic grabs him by the neck and pulls his lower half “W-WAIT”, the hedgehog stops giving him a moment to speak, “y-you said w-we were f-friends, w-why are you d-doing this to m-me?”, tails asked staring into the sonic’s eyeless sockets, “it’s quite simple ‘tails’ you agreed to be my friend yet you didn’t know the consequences and that’s not my issue but yours”, and less then a moment tails neck was snapped but after his flesh was tear off, 


Act 2, Dave/knuckles


in the year of 1994 sonic3&knuckles comes out as a kid named Dave would buy the game and run back home to play the game, when he got home he put in the cartridges and the title screen appeared but something was off the sonic in the title screen wasn’t moving  at all. Just staring at him until the tv breaks and grabs him before snapping his head as he wakes up later in the body of knuckles as he gets up and looks around and saw tails running like hell as he jumps down and hits assailant following him it was sonic? No it couldn’t be… he looked way too different Dave (knuckles) stands his ground just to get pulled into the ground the dirt burying him as he couldn’t breathe while hearing laughter as Dave slowly loses his conscious he just hoped he wasted enough time to let tails to run away but deep down he knows that he didn’t do shit but delaying the inevitable, meanwhile tails was running faster his legs starting to hurt until he heard a car as he turns around just got get ran over by a truck as he dies for the 8903 time, as knuckles(Dave) comes back alive on angel Island as he sees a car crash into the tails as he walks away trying to remember, where is the master emerald, hidden Palace… knuckles got up and ran towards the direction as Sonic(ONE MORE GAME), watched with an amused look while chewing tails head, as he throws away the head and flys off, knuckles made his way though hidden palace, avoiding any of the traps and needles on the floor or roof as he walks towards the master emerald until he gets grabbed and slammed into the ground while ‘sonic’ was laughing while holding the master emerald and throwing it up and down like a rock, “how funny do you really think this over sized pebble can save you?”,knuckles got up and trys to punch him but ‘sonic’ caught it before ripping off his arm “how pathetic…”, he grabs knuckles with his arms coming out of the floor choking him painfully to death and ripping his flesh, “your just like Alan so much fun yet such a failure”, 



Act 3, Isaiahn/Eggman but for my own sanity his called Ivo, 



Isaiahn was dying as he desperately fights off the hand coming out of his TV but he fails and dies anyways, He wakes up feeling buff as hell as he looks down and saw he’s appearance, DOCTER Eggman, Ivo(Isaiahn), gets up and checks the cameras in front of him and sees tails(Alan), and knuckles(Dave) both dead as he got up and runs deeper into the base as he sees ‘sonic’ coming towards him as Ivo quickly, moved behind and runs back where he came from before jumping into the death egg robot, which ‘sonic’ didn’t waste time and started to attack thigh it didn’t taje long after a few minutes later ‘sonic’ got bored and broke the death egg robot as Ivo falls out and trys to run but he’s legs get ripped off as he falls and ‘sonic’ walks towards him as Ivo closes his eyes until metal sonic(Izumi), rushes in hitting ‘sonic’ away, “Doctor quit being a little bitch and get up”, Ivo gets up “Damn alright let’s get the the hell out of here”, both Ivo and metal sonic left as soon as they could as ‘sonic’ got up and less then a second Ivo felt his back snap as his crumples to the floor, “fuck… metal sonic get the hell out of here immediately and that’s an order and turn on self protocol”, Ivo yelled as metal flys off as he was grabbed and was ripped in half as ‘sonic’ stares at the flying away metal sonic, “you can run, fly, do whatever but in the end it will all end the same… Hahahah… HAHAHAHA… AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH”

Right now I don't know why you ever kept getting me back with you when you knew this would happen. I tried to leave, broke it off... I couldn't and you kept bringing me back.

I decided to stop running. 

Then you said you need stability and I understand the other part, but dude. You destabilized me more and more. I left because you couldn't work out the issues with me. I don't understand why I kept coming back. I loved you and it threw me off. And just as I was starting to stabilize, you ended things. 

I'll be where we met on Friday.

My friend had actually set us up - I met him at her party. He had definitely been drunk but seemed interested and funny, we stayed out until about 2 am. He did ask me if I wanted to come over but I said no and he was definitely drunk. The next day he texted me and we eventually were able to grab coffee on Tuesday (yesterday). I admittedly was nervous at first and can seem a bit aloof or uninterested on dates; it's just hard for me to be myself in that setting. He asked some questions but definitely carried the conversation and yapped about himself quite a bit. About an hour in, he abruptly said he had to leave for a wine tasting (he's in restaurant business). The date itself felt so short, but whatever. Going into it, he seemed very open and said he wanted to meet me sober. At the end of the date, I told him that I'd like to hang out again if he's open to it. We hugged goodbye and he said ""You can text me or I'll text you"". Something just felt a little off. I talked to my friend and she said that he's such a sweetie and she's glad we met. Apparently he told her that it was nice to meet me and we had a great chat, but he didn't tell me that? It's been a little over 24 hours, I'm wondering if I should thank him for the coffee (that's just my personality) or just leave it. I feel a little embarrassed as a woman who can't even make it past a first date. And for me, it does feel a lot safer when a guy is the first to reach out after a date (anxious attachment).

I haven't had many long term relationships, so sometimes I feel like a walking red flag. My friend is somehow friends with every guy she's dated or gone on dates with. He actually went on one date with her and apparently they decided to be friends. Her calling him so sweet, not recommending him enough, etc, is making me feel crazy when I haven't even heard anything from him.

The light of the Full Moon brings awareness, while Venus, Jupiter, and Sirius open a new door","(The following article is from my Substack and can be found here: [https://grandtrineastrology.substack.com/p/aquarius-full-moon-august-2025-horoscopes](https://grandtrineastrology.substack.com/p/aquarius-full-moon-august-2025-horoscopes) )

  
**This could be the best week you’ve experienced this year, punctuated by the full moon in the zodiac sign of Aquarius.** Full moons can represent the completion of a cycle, but more often, they serve as a midpoint, a checkpoint marking the progress you've made. The focus now is on self-awareness, a light shining on your path. It’s time to acknowledge what you’ve accomplished and take hold of the momentum you've built. The journey continues, but with the full moon’s illumination, you may begin to see what’s next. Chances are, you’re closer to the horizon than you realize.

And what’s on this horizon?

The Aquarian Full Moon is complex. Landing at 16 degrees and 59 seconds, it sits in the decan of Mercury, which adds a layer of mental activity and curiosity. It’s about gathering data, taking a step back, and observing objectively. This lunation invites us to consider the tension between individualism and humanitarianism. How do you stay true to yourself while honoring your connections and responsibilities to the collective? Gathering information is only the beginning. Discernment is key. How do we apply what we’ve learned to solve problems that are multidimensional?

It may take some time to gain full clarity, especially with the next two new moons both falling in the sign of Virgo. The first occurs on August 23, the very beginning of Virgo season, while the second lands on September 21, at the tail end. My take is that we’re entering a period of recalibration. We might not yet have all the insight we were hoping for.

This sense of uncertainty is echoed in the kite aspect formation appearing during the full moon. Mars in Libra, newly arrived at 1 degree, opposes Saturn and Neptune, both retrograde at 1 degree. This opposition forms the spine of the kite, anchoring it between idealism and action. Mars in Libra seeks harmony, but in its sign of detriment, it may lack drive or rely on passive strategies. There’s a risk of falling in love with the idea rather than the actual person or cause.

At the other end of the opposition, we find Neptune and Saturn in Aries, in retrograde motion. Here, we may feel unsure about what steps to take next, especially when life demands clarity and direction. Disappointment may arise if someone we've admired fails to live up to expectations. There’s tension within this opposition, as if Neptune longs for Libra’s balance while Mars yearns to be back in bold, decisive Aries. Though not a classic mutual reception, the energies seem to trade places, both conflicted and strangely cooperative. This push and pull dynamic forms the energy of the kite, searching for direction.

That’s where Uranus and Pluto step in. Uranus sits at 1 degree of Gemini and forms a supportive trine to Mars. This may spark bold actions that lead to growth. The restlessness many are feeling now could be the spark that breaks us free from old patterns, allowing for extraordinary breakthroughs. These actions may play out along the Aries-Libra axis, bringing benefits to both ourselves and others.

Pluto in Aquarius, retrograde and also at 1 degree, forms a trine to Mars as well. This encourages a deep reassessment of our motivations. Are the people in your life working in your best interest? If we can step back from ego, we might find clarity and begin making plans that drive long-term progress for the collective, and for ourselves.

Let’s turn our focus to the top of the kite. Uranus and Pluto both support Saturn and Neptune, creating a minor grand trine. This combination blends consciousness expansion with idealism and structure. Uranus challenges us to imagine new ways of being, while Saturn asks us to root those visions in reality. The relationship between the two allows us to honor tradition while also making room for innovation.

Even if you feel drained or uncertain about taking on big tasks, Pluto offers a different kind of energy. This is not a sprint but a slow, steady transformation. With a long-range focus and a commitment to precision, we can make change that lasts. Neptune keeps our ideals centered on compassion, unity, and spiritual connection. As long as we resist the urge to push a singular agenda, lasting progress is possible.

The spar of the kite is held by the trine between Uranus and Pluto. Both are in air signs respectively, Gemini and Aquarius, which puts emphasis on thought, communication, and ideas. The kite is a call to problem-solve. It asks us to reflect on questions like: How can we express our individuality while uplifting each other? How can we use shared power to support humanity without losing ourselves? Can we imagine a future where technology automates what was once manual, and if so, who stands to benefit?

At the end of the month, Pluto will move out of bounds, remaining there through mid-November. This is not a one-off event. It will repeat this pattern over the next decade, which is uncommon. While Pluto has gone out of bounds before, this back-and-forth rhythm is unprecedented in modern times. After this window, Pluto won’t go out of bounds again for roughly 3,000 years.

I’ll be diving deeper into this cycle in a future article, but my current theory is that we are entering a powerful period of reform. We may begin to rebuild from the inside out, dismantling what no longer works and regenerating systems that once served us well. This shift could affect everything from personal relationships to society and government structures.

But let me circle back.

Real-world kites are tethered by string. In this chart, Mercury in Leo acts as that thread, sextile to Mars. Even in retrograde, it gives us guidance. This aspect offers a moment to pause and evaluate the messages we’re receiving. It also invites us to reflect on the Leo archetype. Will we move forward with pride and self-importance, or will we lead with generosity and creativity? Mercury and Mars in sextile can be self-directed, but under this lunation, we might realize that we all share similar goals.

The string steers the kite, and with Mercury in opposition to Pluto, there is a strong desire to get to the root of any problem. This aspect pulls us deep, inviting us to investigate or analyze something until we find a core truth. The risk is becoming obsessed, whether with an idea, a person, or a particular outcome. You may find yourself going down rabbit holes in search of clarity or meaning. If that happens, remember that other energies are still holding the bigger picture in place. Venus and Jupiter, two of astrology’s most beneficial planets, are here to guide the way.

Finally, a note of pure optimism. During the Aquarius Full Moon, Venus is in close conjunction with Jupiter. This is an astrological gift, a reminder that when one chapter closes, another begins. This new chapter could bring abundance in more ways than one. Relationships may feel warm, generous, and even indulgent. You might experience a boost in finances or a shift in how you define value. More importantly, this is a moment to breathe, zoom out, and remember the cyclical nature of life. Every swing of the pendulum brings a return.

With that said, the Aquarius Full Moon offers an introspective look at where we are on our current journey. As we walk the path beneath its radiant light, we carry a kite of thoughtful, deliberate action and a backpack filled with hope, optimism, and the nourishment we’ll need for the road ahead.

With that said, the Aquarius Full Moon is an introspective foray into where we are on our current journey. As we walk the path, under its radiating light, we have a kite of thoughtful, deliberate action and a backpack filled with hope, optimism, and nourishment for the trail ahead.

Though I have waxed poetically, I am sure you want to know how the energy impacts your birth chart.

# Full Moon Horoscopes by Rising Sign

The horoscopes are written with the current transits in relation to your rising sign using the whole sign house system. Keep in mind, these are general readings and are not taking into account your specific chart placements. You could get some additional insight by reading your sun and moon, due to derivative astrology, but the horoscope will usually resonate the most with your rising sign.

**Aries Rising:**

Friendship and your social circles are being illuminated with the Aquarius Full Moon. You most likely have been thinking about how you can get more involved in social issues, and with the Full Moon, you may reach out to your friends, engaging them in your humanitarian pursuits. With the 11th house energy, you also could be craving a night out or attending a party to release some energy in a safe space, or doing something new or unusual within your local community. 

You may be a little obsessed with how you are expressing yourself. There could be a gnawing feeling that you haven’t gotten to the bottom of something about your desires. You may be able to gain some clarity through writing or a conversation where you can discuss your past. You’ve most likely been reviewing some of your childhood desires.

Some of your frustration circles back to your closest relationships, as if the two of you are no longer on the same page. You want to take action, but you’re not sure which action to take. It’s like a gnat flying around your head, annoying you, and no matter how much you shoo it away, it doesn’t leave. You could be wondering if you are outgrowing your partner or the situation you are in.

But overall, when it comes to the home and your career, you are feeling optimistic. It’s as if the undercurrent of your life is unsettling, but at the same time, you have hope. You may feel like you have one foot in one world and the other foot in another, balancing what was while creating a place of warmth, love, and generosity.

**Taurus Rising:**

How your inner world relates to your career will be the focus of the Full Moon. You may feel torn, wondering if you have a healthy work-life balance. Though you have long-term plans and are finding personal growth at work, you may be questioning your purpose, or generally, the purpose of work and the human condition.

Your daily life is filled with tasks, and you could be reviewing how to automate things at home or how to make your house more efficient. This could be everything from settings on your air conditioning unit to prepping daily meals. It’s as if you intuitively know there is a better way when it comes to routine, but figuring out exactly how to implement changes could be a challenge.

Where you are finding optimism is when you engage in local activities, especially those relating to music or art. Exploring community museums or a live band at your local brewery is helping you to not feel overwhelmed by home or work. You may feel closer to your siblings or cousins and could be planning a family reunion or at least a summer BBQ.

And though you may feel mentally drained, you are motivated to take action when it comes to your overall health. You could be resetting your priorities, gaining insight on what balance truly means, and it may not be the script that has been fed to you throughout your life.

**Gemini Rising:**

The Full Moon is illuminating your 9th house of beliefs, assumptions, and learned knowledge. You could be questioning subjects taught to you in the past, especially those that revolve around religion, higher education, cultural mores, and the rule of law. You could be reviewing what your education has provided you and how to make the most of the information you’ve acquired.

These questions may impact your personal values. You might be feeling more optimistic, seeing the world through a lens of hope as you evaluate your foundation. Even though what you disagree with is in the news, you may believe that it’s a false narrative that will eventually crumble. Is your point of view based on reality? Maybe not completely, but there’s a part of you that knows humanity can strive for the greater good.

What this comes down to is what creative actions you are going to take to be part of something that aligns with your core truths. You’ve seen how things were done in the past, and in your gut, you know a different approach needs to be taken, whether this is about your role in society, your personal desires, how you communicate, or how your words need to be backed up with balanced effort.

You could feel like you are halfway there and just need some motivation and clarity to make it to your final destination. Take time this week to engage with your social circle and allow yourself to go deeper in conversation, especially around how to be present and active in society without being consumed by the chaos. Figuring out your role could open you up to new possibilities, and you might discover your destined calling.

**Cancer Rising:**

You’ve been thinking about your shared finances, debts, and taxes for a while, and under this Full Moon, there could be a revelation on how to get your estate in order. You may be thinking long-term and diversifying, opening yourself up to collaborations and affiliations that can help you with your resources. You may need to throw everything onto a spreadsheet to get a clearer perspective or meet with a financial advisor.

You’ve been reviewing your long-term goals in regard to your career, most likely asking yourself how what you do now aligns with your past hopes and dreams. If your career is what you’ve always wanted to do, you could be reimagining how to proceed, especially when it comes to your reputation or credibility.

Your dreams lately have been more visual than usual, and you could be thinking of deep themes, having unique insights that are difficult to put into words. During the day, you could have flashes of intuition sparked by a surprising source. For example, you could look at a tomato plant and suddenly feel like you know the secrets of the universe. This might feel a little jarring, and you could question your sanity, but you’ve been given the opportunity to download information in unique ways.

The good news for you is that luck is truly on your side right now. If you are in a tight situation, you may still feel optimistic that your ship will come in. You could feel unstoppable and see the world through rose-colored glasses. This isn’t delusion. Quite the opposite. It’s as if you have a crystal ball helping you focus beyond the veil, giving you the ability to manifest your wants and desires.

**Leo Rising:**

Your relationships are the focal point during the Full Moon. How you feel about yourself within the parameters of partnership is spotlighted. Are you bringing as much effort as your significant other, or are you doing all the heavy lifting? Sometimes we need to look at our relationships from a bird’s eye view to gain objectivity, so we can be active participants and not just recipients. As you review the current status of your partnerships, avoid judgment. Instead, analyze without blame or condemnation.

Ideally, you are balancing your actions with responsibility. This is a good time to break habits of assumption and seek out knowledge from credible sources. If you typically get all your news from one outlet, branch out and explore opposing viewpoints. Hopefully, you are using this energetic cycle to widen your scope and see your life, and the world, from a more humanistic lens.

Spiritually, you are feeling optimistic, even if you are spending more time alone than usual. You are most likely shifting your perspective. It may not be a lightbulb moment, but rather, a powerful feeling of love that transcends wants, needs, and desires.

You may be drawn to a new group of friends, people outside of your usual circle. You could find yourself at a metaphysical bookstore or exploring a local “Eat, Pray, Love” experience. You might visit a Buddhist temple or a place of worship different from the one you were raised in. Or maybe you simply spend a day at a Korean spa, soaking in the heat and allowing yourself to drift deep into your subconscious.

**Virgo Rising:** 

The Full Moon is shining on your daily grind, asking you to take a look at your routines. You may be wondering if you’re as healthy as you could be, with a focus on mind, body, and soul. Your energy may not be what it once was, so making a few adjustments could help recharge your batteries. Much of the drain comes from private thoughts, rethinking the past, imagining different outcomes based on things you said or did.

No matter how much you think about the past, remember that you can’t change it. What you can do is give yourself enough rest so you’re better equipped to make good decisions going forward. With the current energy, guided meditations or slow, deliberate stretches can help relax your mind and prepare you for deeper sleep. Once rested, the answers you’ve been chasing may appear with surprising ease.

Some of the burden on your shoulders relates to money, career, and resources. Ideally, you may wish to be supported or have a financial safety net. Lately, though, you’ve been concerned about the stability of your career or investments. You might be taking steps to create more income without adding more work. This could include selling something valuable that takes up too much space or no longer brings you joy.

Your friendships are where you're finding joy and renewal. You might enjoy hosting a cookout or potluck, playing board games, or just sharing meaningful conversations. Your friends could feel more like family than your actual relatives, and in their company, your worries seem to dissolve.

**Libra Rising:**

You may be feeling emotional, but in the very best of ways with this Full Moon. Highlighting the house of joy, bliss, creativity, and self-expression, you may want to tell everyone you care about how much you love them and why you’re happy they’re in your life. If you have children, you could feel a deeper sense of appreciation for them. If there are issues with your children, you may be looking inward, figuring out what more you can do to bring a sense of well-being to the relationship or to their lives.

When it comes to you and your partner, you may take action to create more harmony. You could be revisiting hopes and dreams you once shared and making plans to return to the first place you went to dinner, or trying a new spot that serves their favorite cuisine. It may feel like you’re making up for lost time and want to celebrate what the two of you have built together.

Your interests have expanded, and you may be dabbling in a new language or taking up an unusual study. You’re more open to someone else’s point of view, no matter how out there you once thought it was. There’s excitement in discovery, and venturing out of your comfort zone is something you now welcome with enthusiasm.

Finally, there’s work. Your attitude has shifted dramatically over the past few months. You’re no longer burning the candle at both ends. Instead, you’re happy to take on projects. Your workload may be the same, but now you’re being appreciated for your contributions. You also have a broader perspective, both in the work you do and in your career path as a whole.

**Scorpio Rising:**

If you feel like staying in bed, it could be due to the Full Moon in your 4th house of home and family. Childhood memories could come front and center. These may be positive and warm, or they might bring up times when you felt isolated or disconnected. Either way, this Full Moon offers the opportunity to create a home that makes you and your loved ones feel safe, secure, and cared for.

You may have had to redo some work projects or reevaluate your career path. There’s a weighty sense of responsibility tied to your daily tasks, and it might feel overwhelming. Still, this is a good time to review your routine. Chances are, you’ve been overfocusing on tasks that aren’t yielding results while neglecting the ones that could bring success. By taking action to create more balance, you can support your mental health and reduce stress.

If part of your income relies on a partner or spouse, be aware that over the next six years, their resources may fluctuate. This doesn’t mean financial ruin, but they could experience highs and lows or occasional interruptions in income. That’s why it’s important to get your own work life in order, so you aren’t fully dependent on their support. Keep in mind, windfalls are possible too, for both of you, but having a backup plan will give you more peace of mind.

You’ll find good fortune through experiences like travel, creative work, writing, and legal matters. If you’re entangled in a lawsuit, the odds are likely in your favor. If you’ve been working on a novel or artistic project, there’s a strong chance of getting published or featured. If you’re studying something at a higher level, you may find that you’re not only scoring well, but truly absorbing the material in a meaningful way.

**Sagittarius Rising:**

If you feel the sudden urge to call a sibling, cousin, or childhood friend, it’s because the Full Moon is lighting up your 3rd house. This is a good time to get out into your community. Grab coffee at your local café or pack a picnic for the park and soak up the sunshine. You may be feeling chatty, but you’ll also be genuinely interested in hearing other people’s stories.

This is a great day to make plans, even if they’re spontaneous. Go out dancing or catch a live music event. Gather with friends or invite them over for some summer fun. You may not have the most creative ideas about what to do, but that’s okay. Your optimism is infectious and will inspire others to help come up with something fun.

If you’re single, this is an excellent time to meet someone. Will it be your forever person? Maybe. But even if it’s not long-term, it could still be a joyful, exciting connection. The person may be very different from anyone you’ve dated before, maybe a little quirky, eccentric, or extremely charming. They might shower you with compliments or be stunning in personality, appearance, or both.

You could also receive money from a shared source or win something unexpectedly. That sounds great, and it is, but be careful. You might be tempted to blow the extra money on food, drinks, or something lavish, and regret it the next day when there’s nothing to show for it.

**Capricorn Rising:** 

There’s a saying about counting your blessings, and this week you might find yourself counting what you truly value, your possessions, your principles, and your sense of worth. With the Full Moon in your second house, you may be focused on what matters most to you. You could be digging through a jewelry box and finding your grandmother’s brooch, remembering how special you felt when she gave it to you.

Home has felt like a lot lately, with many responsibilities and tasks to manage. You might be cleaning out closets or rearranging furniture to make the space more functional. As you do, it’s natural to feel sentimental. This process may help you determine what’s worth keeping, both financially and emotionally, and what no longer has a place in your life. Once you declutter, you’ll likely feel a renewed sense of peace in your environment.

Work has recently picked up, and you may have experienced unexpected changes or disruptions in your schedule. There could be shifts happening at your job, restructured departments or redefined roles. It’s a time to stay flexible and take initiative. Consider outlining your accomplishments and updating your list of skills, just in case you need to advocate for your role or explore other opportunities.

Even though your work life may feel uncertain (as it does for many right now), your relationships are thriving. If you’re married, it could feel like a second honeymoon. If you’ve been dating someone, an engagement could be on the horizon. And even at work, your boss sees you in a great light. If you’re single, this could be the week you meet someone truly special.

**Aquarius Rising:**

This Full Moon offers insight into your personal journey for the years to come. With the moon in your first house, the focus is on how you relate to your friends, family, and co-workers. Where do you fit into your relationships? How do you want to move forward? Who belongs in your inner circle? These are the kinds of questions you may be contemplating now.

Some answers could come from your role in the community. You might be rethinking how you show up in your neighborhood or in public spaces. There could be a pull to volunteer or to enroll in classes you once put off. You may discover cultural or educational institutions nearby that you’ve never explored, places like planetariums, museums, historic homes, or serene sanctuaries.

You might find yourself in a heart-to-heart conversation with your romantic partner. If things have gone stale or if you both see the future differently, now is the time to talk. I’m not saying you should break up, but without honest and thoughtful discussions, the relationship could suffer. Know where you’re flexible and where you’re not before initiating the conversation.

Even so, you’re optimistic about your daily life. You may be beautifying your workspace, hanging up photos of your pet, or seeking work that brings meaning and joy. There’s even a possibility of a workplace romance, so approach that carefully, just as you would with any indulgence.

**Pisces Rising:**

The house of personal insight is illuminated by the Aquarius Full Moon. You may gain spiritual clarity, especially around the human condition and the greater purpose of life. You might feel like retreating inward, tapping into your unconscious, and seeking a more enlightened perspective. You naturally want healing and light for everyone, and current world events could feel especially heavy. Understanding that life moves in cycles, and that existence extends beyond this incarnation, may offer some peace.

Financially, things might be tight. You may have dipped into savings recently to cover bills or unexpected expenses. This is a good time to take action around resources. Consider picking up a side gig or finally clearing out the attic, basement, or garage and selling what you don’t need. Even a few extra hours a week could help ease financial pressure.

Although inflation is real, you may want to review your home for opportunities to reduce unnecessary costs. It might be something small, like replacing weather stripping to lower electric bills or using solar film on your windows. Habits like leaving the water running or lights on add up. Small tweaks and handling issues early can support your long-term savings.

Where you’ll find luck is in self-expression. Spend time with family and friends this week. If you’re creative, write a song, paint, draw, or dress in a way that reflects your inner child. Even if you’re not a performer, it’s a great time to try karaoke. Joy, love, and gratitude will carry you far right now. And if you’re looking for romance, someone special could appear, but you have to be out there to meet them. Or maybe a friend has someone in mind who’s just your type.

# Manifesting with a Full Moon

Because full moons are known for culmination or checking in on progress, manifesting something entirely new is not usually advised. However, this is a good time to continue any manifestations you've already begun.

That said, there are a couple of excellent days for manifestation coming up: August 11 and 12. I recommend starting your manifestation rituals on the 11th if possible, though the 12th should also be effective.

So why these two days? Mercury goes direct at 3:30 AM CDT on August 11. Then, at 12:30 PM CDT on August 12, Venus and Jupiter will make an exact conjunction at 14 degrees and 3 seconds, while the fixed star Sirius will be at 14 degrees and 25 seconds.

Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and is one of the Behenian Fixed Stars. It’s known for bringing success in a positive and lasting way. But let me offer a word of caution. Sirius shines with an intense brightness, and when paired with manifestation, it can bring what you desire in such a big way that it may feel overwhelming. This is why the Full Moon is a good time to reflect on what you truly want and visualize how it might unfold. Ask yourself: are you ready for your heart’s desire?

With Sirius conjunct both benefic planets, this feels like a bright light guiding you to manifest your dreams, whether they’re related to growth, spirituality, finances, income, security, creativity, love, or romance.

The optimistic part of me wants to say this configuration is good for everyone. But realistically, it depends on your chart. If you have your ascendant near 14 degrees of Cancer, or your Sun, Moon, Venus, or Jupiter near that degree, you may receive the most abundance. Those with placements near 14 degrees in the other cardinal signs of Libra, Capricorn, or Aries may also benefit. If you have planets or points forming a trine or sextile to 14 degrees of Cancer, you might notice positive results as well.

If you’re new to manifesting, you might want to explore the 12 Universal Laws or check out *The Secret* by Rhonda Byrne. Twelve years ago, I manifested the love of my life, my dream job, and a return to my hometown, where I even bought back the house I had regretted selling. I watched *The Secret* and let it play in the background whenever I was home, following the steps laid out in the documentary. And yes, I’ll warn you now, it’s cheesy, and you may roll your eyes at the beginning. But by the end, you might feel the shift. There are critics of this approach, and I can’t guarantee it will work for you, but it has worked for me many times.

Whether or not you choose to manifest, this Full Moon can help you tap into your personal power. It invites you to recognize what’s working in your life and what needs to change. Even with Mercury in retrograde, this can be a Full Moon of love, luck, and positive momentum. You may not have it all figured out, and that’s okay. The purpose of the Full Moon is to bring your inner wisdom to the surface. Embrace the energy and allow the light to guide your way.

But then, the regular comes back at LEAST 3-6 times for venti green iced tea refills.

Now, I know any handcrafted drink is eligible for a refill (provided they stay at the location somewhere) and it’s as many as they want as long as they stay. HOWEVER; the policy states that the refill can only be either the same size as the first beverage, or smaller.

EXAMPLE: So say Steve ordered a tall coffee, and later wants a refill of a venti coffee. Per policy, we should be giving Steve another tall size despite wanting a venti.

So now my question: What size should I be giving the regular? An iced espresso defaults to grande on the POS. Wanting an iced espresso but in a venti cup sounds like I should technically be giving him grande-sized refills, because the default size for an iced espresso is grande.

Digital transformation is at the heart of this boom. The 2025 mandate from the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) now requires many businesses to offer at least one digital payment method at the point of sale, and electronic invoicing is becoming the norm.\
However, Bahrain still values its traditions. Business in a majlis often starts with dates and coffee before you ever see a laptop. During Ramadan, business hours shift and digital response times suffer. Yet, the push for financial inclusion remains relentless.\
For a deeper dive into Bahrain’s growth metrics and business policy, visit Gulf News Bahrain and the official Bahrain government site.\
\
What Are the Digital Payment Requirements in Bahrain?\
The basics: Since 2023 and reinforced by the new 2025 CBB circular, all commercial entities with a point-of-sale interface—be it a fixed store, kiosk, or e-commerce checkout—must enable at least one recognized digital payment channel (debit/credit card, BenefitPay, or approved payment gateway).\
\
In practice, this requirement aims to cut cash handling, reduce tax evasion, and encourage transparency—clear priorities if you’ve ever navigated Sijilat’s compliance queue at 11 a.m. on a Sunday.\
\
Who Enforces the Rules?\
\
Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB)\
Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT)\
National e-Payment Gateway (BenefitPay)\
\
Key 2025 Policy Update\
On March 1, 2025, the CBB increased on-site inspections and instant fines for non-compliant retail setups. Non-compliance now carries a BHD 500 penalty per incident, up from BHD 250. All new CR applications in Sijilat must declare and, if required, prove their digital payment setups before license activation.\
\
Are Any Business Types Exempt from Digital Payment Requirements?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.\
A. Micro/Small-Scale Businesses in Designated Areas\
\
Street vendors with no fixed premises (e.g., Adliya’s evening food stalls)\
Traditional souq vendors with annual turnover  Tip: If you’re unsure, MOICT’s Sijilat web portal now provides an “Exemption Request” button. Don’t skip this—fines are automate.\
\
\
Practical Examples Based on Firsthand Experience\
Take my client from the Diplomatic Area, operating a law consultancy. He believed digital payment requirements didn’t apply since most clients paid via bank transfer. MOICT disagreed—any firm advertising walk-in consultations must accept at least one digital payment channel, even if only 5% of transactions are walk-in.\
Example: Local Carpet Weaver in Hamad Town\
\
Annual revenue: BHD 8,000\
Business model: cash sales to walk-in clients\
Application: Sijilat exemption request, supported by neighborhood majlis head’s letter\
\
Outcome: Approved. However, exemption limited to 2025 renewal period, subject to CBB review.\
Example: Food Truck at Bahrain Bay\
\
Revenue: BHD 80,000 (high season)\
Attempted exemption: denied—CBB considers high-volume mobile vendors “retail outlets,” trigger digital payment requirement\
Fix: Enrolled with BenefitPay, monthly cost BHD 12\
\
\
Key insight: any business “mobile but high turnover” triggers compliance. If you’re scaling up, plan accordingly.\
\
\
Cost Considerations: How Much to Budget for Digital Payment Compliance?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
\
BenefitPay merchant onboarding: BHD 30 setup + BHD 10-25 monthly fee, transaction rate ~1.5%\
Bank POS terminal: BHD 50-150 installation + 1.75% transaction fee, refunded after one year if minimum volume met\
Online payment gateway (Tap, PayTabs, etc.): Setup BHD 25-50, monthly fee BHD 15-35, transaction rate 2.2%-2.9%\
\
Budget range for micro-businesses:\
Initial: BHD 50-200, Monthly: BHD 10-30\
For retail/foodservice with more than one POS:\
Initial: BHD 250-400, Monthly: BHD 30-60\
See here for a full breakdown of Bahrain company formation costs.\
Money-Saving Insider Tips\
\
Apply for Tamkeen’s “SME Digitalization Package”—rebates up to BHD 500 for eligible startups.\
Register with two payment providers to compare rates; some banks waive three months’ fees for new merchants (I once saved BHD 75 on a single license cycle this way).\
For quick setup, schedule Sijilat application between 9:45-10:30 a.m. Tuesday—lowest queue (personal observation after 130+ filings).\
\
\
Step-by-Step Guidance: Navigating Compliance and Exemption Requests\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. copy\
- Lease agreement or landlord’s letter (for micro/home-based exemptions)\
- Financial summary (turnover statement, last 12 months)\
- Proof of business type (trade license, event permit, NGO certificate)\
- Letter from a local authority or majlis leader, if applicable\
Shortcut: In most Sijilat requests, uploading a PDF bank statement with revenue summary plus a photo of your setup (stall, workroom) speeds approval by 2-3 days.\
2. Apply via Sijilat Portal (Commercial Registration in Bahrain)\
\
Log in, select “Digital Payment Exemption Request”\
Upload docs, select business type, justify request (be concise; “seasonal, cash-only, low turnover” works best)\
Receive SMS/Email notification on approval or further document request\
\
3. Follow Up in Person (If Urgent)\
\
Head to the MOICT Sijilat office in Seef District\
Bring originals—sometimes, verbal explanation in Arabic helps (my Arabic isn’t perfect, but showing up in person cut my last review from 5 days to 40 minutes).\
During Ramadan, go before 11 a.m.\
\
4. Digital Payment Registration (If Required)\
\
Connect with local banks or BenefitPay partners immediately after CR approval\
E-invoicing setup (most providers offer 2-hour training sessions)\
\
\
Mistake alert: Many skip the “activation” step—be sure your device is tested and prints digital receipts before opening. Inspectors often check by midnight on launch day.\

\
Compliance, Accounting, and Post-Formation Nuances\
!(\
- Annual renewal requires digital payment compliance confirmation\
- Randomized site inspections (MOICT/CBB cross-check)\
- Bookkeeping: All digital payment transactions must be reconciled with monthly accounts\
I recommend outsourcing to a Bahrain-based accounting provider with strong digital capabilities—KeyLink’s accounting and bookkeeping services are reliable and priced better than most boutique consultancies.\
\
Side note: Bahrain’s regulatory culture prioritizes relationship-building. I once accelerated a delayed exemption by following up with a short, respectful WhatsApp message to the Sijilat desk manager after meeting him at a Bahrain Bay networking breakfast (don’t underestimate in-person rapport).\
\
\
Business Structure Choices: How They Impact Payment Compliance\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.: Rarely exempt—seen as commercial by default.\
- Single Person Company: Micro-entities allowed to apply for exemptions, but rare success in retail/hospitality.\
- Branch/Subsidiary: Parent company’s payment protocols required.\
- Sole Proprietorship:** Odds of exemption slightly higher, especially in home-based/seasonal models.\

\
Ownership, Sponsorship, and Digital Payment Implications\
\
Foreign Ownership (up to 100%): See activities list—some activities allow 99% or 100% foreign ownership. No impact on digital payment requirement; compliance is universal.\
Local Sponsorship: Required only for certain regulated sectors. See local sponsorship guidance.\
\
Surprisingly, free zone companies (Bahrain Logistics Zone, BAPCO Free Zone) face identical digital payment rules. Avoid assuming a free zone means flexibility—see free zones info.\
For foreign owners considering Bahrain vs. UAE or Saudi Arabia: Bahrain’s digital payment enforcement is less aggressive than the UAE’s (where fines are higher and enforcement is rigid), but more thorough than in Saudi, where cash transactions remain common in some areas.\
\
Insider Perspectives on Bahrain’s Business Culture\
\
Majlis-Style Meetings: Building trust is as important as compliance. Bring small talk, accept coffee, and listen before making requests.\
Ramadan Adjustments: Expect slower government response after 2 p.m., but early-morning visits often yield surprisingly fast paperwork approvals (I learned this after weeks of late-afternoon dead ends).\
Traditional Coffee Service: Accepting a cup before official business can open doors—in one case, a refused coffee meant a delayed file review.\
\
\
A Tangent (That Matters): Why Bahrain’s Coffee Culture Actually Influences Digital Payment Adoption\
One might think this is off-topic, but bear with me. The age-old tradition of serving coffee before business talks has led to a unique dynamic—in smaller businesses, especially in areas like Muharraq or the souqs, the slow pace of traditional interaction shapes attitudes toward cash and digital. These cultural nuances are why the CBB softened digital payment mandates for micro-entities and why, if you watch closely, cash-only coffee stalls still thrive in Bahrain Bay’s weekend markets.\
\
The intersection of custom and policy is where Bahrain’s business charm and regulatory flexibility truly meet.\
\
\
Recommended Resources and Service Providers\
My go-to for expedited digital payment setup: BenefitPay’s team at Bahrain Financial Harbour—they accept walk-ins before 11:15 a.m., and processing is 50% faster than most bank branches. For accounting, KeyLink’s professional team consistently solves digital transaction reconciliation—with far less headache than DIY solutions.\
\
Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\
Mistake: Delaying Digital Setup Until Opening Day\
\
Prevention: Start application process at least 7 working days pre-launch. Test system live—don’t wait until Sijilat inspector arrives.\
\
Mistake: Underestimating Document Proof Needs\
\
Prevention: Always bring physical and digital copies of all supporting documents, including proof of business area and turnover.\
\
Mistake: Relying on Verbal Exemptions\
\
Prevention: Get every promise in writing from MOICT/Sijilat; verbal guarantees may not stand during inspections (I learned this lesson after a client’s cash-only license was revoked without appeal).\
\
\
Practical FAQ: Digital Payment Exemptions and Bahrain Company Formation\
1. Can I apply for a digital payment exemption after my business launches?\
Yes, but approval is limited. Submit your request directly through the Sijilat portal and be prepared for a site visit and revenue audit.\
2. Do free zone companies receive special exemptions from digital payment rules?\
No. Free zone or not, all businesses with direct customer sales must comply. See benefits and limitations of Bahrain free zones.\
3. Can 100% foreign-owned businesses operate with cash-only policies?\
Only micro-entities in specific circumstances may receive exemption, regardless of ownership. Standards are enforced equally; check allowed activity codes for details.\
4. What’s the fastest way to get digital payment facilities activated?\
Visit BenefitPay’s Bahrain Financial Harbour desk before 11 a.m.; bring your CR number, copy of bank account details, and stamp. Approval usually takes under an hour.\
5. Where can I find a detailed guide on Bahrain company formation with compliance tips?\
Explore the KeyLink Bahrain company formation resource for updated, step-by-step professional support, fee structures, and compliance checklists.\
\
\
Expert opinion: Building a Bahrain business means embracing both the digital future and the personal—sometimes analog—present. With preparation, the right resources, and a respectful nod to local customs, navigating digital payment requirements (and exemptions) saves both time and money, while opening the door to Bahrain’s rapidly growing market.\

The horoscopes are written with the current transits in relation to your rising sign using the whole sign house system. Keep in mind, these are general readings and are not taking into account your specific chart placements. You could get some additional insight by reading your sun and moon, due to derivative astrology, but the horoscope will usually resonate the most with your rising sign.

**Aries Rising:**

Friendship and your social circles are being illuminated with the Aquarius Full Moon. You most likely have been thinking about how you can get more involved in social issues, and with the Full Moon, you may reach out to your friends, engaging them in your humanitarian pursuits. With the 11th house energy, you also could be craving a night out or attending a party to release some energy in a safe space, or doing something new or unusual within your local community. 

You may be a little obsessed with how you are expressing yourself. There could be a gnawing feeling that you haven’t gotten to the bottom of something about your desires. You may be able to gain some clarity through writing or a conversation where you can discuss your past. You’ve most likely been reviewing some of your childhood desires.

Some of your frustration circles back to your closest relationships, as if the two of you are no longer on the same page. You want to take action, but you’re not sure which action to take. It’s like a gnat flying around your head, annoying you, and no matter how much you shoo it away, it doesn’t leave. You could be wondering if you are outgrowing your partner or the situation you are in.

But overall, when it comes to the home and your career, you are feeling optimistic. It’s as if the undercurrent of your life is unsettling, but at the same time, you have hope. You may feel like you have one foot in one world and the other foot in another, balancing what was while creating a place of warmth, love, and generosity.

**Taurus Rising:**

How your inner world relates to your career will be the focus of the Full Moon. You may feel torn, wondering if you have a healthy work-life balance. Though you have long-term plans and are finding personal growth at work, you may be questioning your purpose, or generally, the purpose of work and the human condition.

Your daily life is filled with tasks, and you could be reviewing how to automate things at home or how to make your house more efficient. This could be everything from settings on your air conditioning unit to prepping daily meals. It’s as if you intuitively know there is a better way when it comes to routine, but figuring out exactly how to implement changes could be a challenge.

Where you are finding optimism is when you engage in local activities, especially those relating to music or art. Exploring community museums or a live band at your local brewery is helping you to not feel overwhelmed by home or work. You may feel closer to your siblings or cousins and could be planning a family reunion or at least a summer BBQ.

And though you may feel mentally drained, you are motivated to take action when it comes to your overall health. You could be resetting your priorities, gaining insight on what balance truly means, and it may not be the script that has been fed to you throughout your life.

**Gemini Rising:**

The Full Moon is illuminating your 9th house of beliefs, assumptions, and learned knowledge. You could be questioning subjects taught to you in the past, especially those that revolve around religion, higher education, cultural mores, and the rule of law. You could be reviewing what your education has provided you and how to make the most of the information you’ve acquired.

These questions may impact your personal values. You might be feeling more optimistic, seeing the world through a lens of hope as you evaluate your foundation. Even though what you disagree with is in the news, you may believe that it’s a false narrative that will eventually crumble. Is your point of view based on reality? Maybe not completely, but there’s a part of you that knows humanity can strive for the greater good.

What this comes down to is what creative actions you are going to take to be part of something that aligns with your core truths. You’ve seen how things were done in the past, and in your gut, you know a different approach needs to be taken, whether this is about your role in society, your personal desires, how you communicate, or how your words need to be backed up with balanced effort.

You could feel like you are halfway there and just need some motivation and clarity to make it to your final destination. Take time this week to engage with your social circle and allow yourself to go deeper in conversation, especially around how to be present and active in society without being consumed by the chaos. Figuring out your role could open you up to new possibilities, and you might discover your destined calling.

**Cancer Rising:**

You’ve been thinking about your shared finances, debts, and taxes for a while, and under this Full Moon, there could be a revelation on how to get your estate in order. You may be thinking long-term and diversifying, opening yourself up to collaborations and affiliations that can help you with your resources. You may need to throw everything onto a spreadsheet to get a clearer perspective or meet with a financial advisor.

You’ve been reviewing your long-term goals in regard to your career, most likely asking yourself how what you do now aligns with your past hopes and dreams. If your career is what you’ve always wanted to do, you could be reimagining how to proceed, especially when it comes to your reputation or credibility.

Your dreams lately have been more visual than usual, and you could be thinking of deep themes, having unique insights that are difficult to put into words. During the day, you could have flashes of intuition sparked by a surprising source. For example, you could look at a tomato plant and suddenly feel like you know the secrets of the universe. This might feel a little jarring, and you could question your sanity, but you’ve been given the opportunity to download information in unique ways.

The good news for you is that luck is truly on your side right now. If you are in a tight situation, you may still feel optimistic that your ship will come in. You could feel unstoppable and see the world through rose-colored glasses. This isn’t delusion. Quite the opposite. It’s as if you have a crystal ball helping you focus beyond the veil, giving you the ability to manifest your wants and desires.

**Leo Rising:**

Your relationships are the focal point during the Full Moon. How you feel about yourself within the parameters of partnership is spotlighted. Are you bringing as much effort as your significant other, or are you doing all the heavy lifting? Sometimes we need to look at our relationships from a bird’s eye view to gain objectivity, so we can be active participants and not just recipients. As you review the current status of your partnerships, avoid judgment. Instead, analyze without blame or condemnation.

Ideally, you are balancing your actions with responsibility. This is a good time to break habits of assumption and seek out knowledge from credible sources. If you typically get all your news from one outlet, branch out and explore opposing viewpoints. Hopefully, you are using this energetic cycle to widen your scope and see your life, and the world, from a more humanistic lens.

Spiritually, you are feeling optimistic, even if you are spending more time alone than usual. You are most likely shifting your perspective. It may not be a lightbulb moment, but rather, a powerful feeling of love that transcends wants, needs, and desires.

You may be drawn to a new group of friends, people outside of your usual circle. You could find yourself at a metaphysical bookstore or exploring a local “Eat, Pray, Love” experience. You might visit a Buddhist temple or a place of worship different from the one you were raised in. Or maybe you simply spend a day at a Korean spa, soaking in the heat and allowing yourself to drift deep into your subconscious.

**Virgo Rising:** 

The Full Moon is shining on your daily grind, asking you to take a look at your routines. You may be wondering if you’re as healthy as you could be, with a focus on mind, body, and soul. Your energy may not be what it once was, so making a few adjustments could help recharge your batteries. Much of the drain comes from private thoughts, rethinking the past, imagining different outcomes based on things you said or did.

No matter how much you think about the past, remember that you can’t change it. What you can do is give yourself enough rest so you’re better equipped to make good decisions going forward. With the current energy, guided meditations or slow, deliberate stretches can help relax your mind and prepare you for deeper sleep. Once rested, the answers you’ve been chasing may appear with surprising ease.

Some of the burden on your shoulders relates to money, career, and resources. Ideally, you may wish to be supported or have a financial safety net. Lately, though, you’ve been concerned about the stability of your career or investments. You might be taking steps to create more income without adding more work. This could include selling something valuable that takes up too much space or no longer brings you joy.

Your friendships are where you're finding joy and renewal. You might enjoy hosting a cookout or potluck, playing board games, or just sharing meaningful conversations. Your friends could feel more like family than your actual relatives, and in their company, your worries seem to dissolve.

**Libra Rising:**

You may be feeling emotional, but in the very best of ways with this Full Moon. Highlighting the house of joy, bliss, creativity, and self-expression, you may want to tell everyone you care about how much you love them and why you’re happy they’re in your life. If you have children, you could feel a deeper sense of appreciation for them. If there are issues with your children, you may be looking inward, figuring out what more you can do to bring a sense of well-being to the relationship or to their lives.

When it comes to you and your partner, you may take action to create more harmony. You could be revisiting hopes and dreams you once shared and making plans to return to the first place you went to dinner, or trying a new spot that serves their favorite cuisine. It may feel like you’re making up for lost time and want to celebrate what the two of you have built together.

Your interests have expanded, and you may be dabbling in a new language or taking up an unusual study. You’re more open to someone else’s point of view, no matter how out there you once thought it was. There’s excitement in discovery, and venturing out of your comfort zone is something you now welcome with enthusiasm.

Finally, there’s work. Your attitude has shifted dramatically over the past few months. You’re no longer burning the candle at both ends. Instead, you’re happy to take on projects. Your workload may be the same, but now you’re being appreciated for your contributions. You also have a broader perspective, both in the work you do and in your career path as a whole.

**Scorpio Rising:**

If you feel like staying in bed, it could be due to the Full Moon in your 4th house of home and family. Childhood memories could come front and center. These may be positive and warm, or they might bring up times when you felt isolated or disconnected. Either way, this Full Moon offers the opportunity to create a home that makes you and your loved ones feel safe, secure, and cared for.

You may have had to redo some work projects or reevaluate your career path. There’s a weighty sense of responsibility tied to your daily tasks, and it might feel overwhelming. Still, this is a good time to review your routine. Chances are, you’ve been overfocusing on tasks that aren’t yielding results while neglecting the ones that could bring success. By taking action to create more balance, you can support your mental health and reduce stress.

If part of your income relies on a partner or spouse, be aware that over the next six years, their resources may fluctuate. This doesn’t mean financial ruin, but they could experience highs and lows or occasional interruptions in income. That’s why it’s important to get your own work life in order, so you aren’t fully dependent on their support. Keep in mind, windfalls are possible too, for both of you, but having a backup plan will give you more peace of mind.

You’ll find good fortune through experiences like travel, creative work, writing, and legal matters. If you’re entangled in a lawsuit, the odds are likely in your favor. If you’ve been working on a novel or artistic project, there’s a strong chance of getting published or featured. If you’re studying something at a higher level, you may find that you’re not only scoring well, but truly absorbing the material in a meaningful way.

**Sagittarius Rising:**

If you feel the sudden urge to call a sibling, cousin, or childhood friend, it’s because the Full Moon is lighting up your 3rd house. This is a good time to get out into your community. Grab coffee at your local café or pack a picnic for the park and soak up the sunshine. You may be feeling chatty, but you’ll also be genuinely interested in hearing other people’s stories.

This is a great day to make plans, even if they’re spontaneous. Go out dancing or catch a live music event. Gather with friends or invite them over for some summer fun. You may not have the most creative ideas about what to do, but that’s okay. Your optimism is infectious and will inspire others to help come up with something fun.

If you’re single, this is an excellent time to meet someone. Will it be your forever person? Maybe. But even if it’s not long-term, it could still be a joyful, exciting connection. The person may be very different from anyone you’ve dated before, maybe a little quirky, eccentric, or extremely charming. They might shower you with compliments or be stunning in personality, appearance, or both.

You could also receive money from a shared source or win something unexpectedly. That sounds great, and it is, but be careful. You might be tempted to blow the extra money on food, drinks, or something lavish, and regret it the next day when there’s nothing to show for it.

**Capricorn Rising:** 

There’s a saying about counting your blessings, and this week you might find yourself counting what you truly value, your possessions, your principles, and your sense of worth. With the Full Moon in your second house, you may be focused on what matters most to you. You could be digging through a jewelry box and finding your grandmother’s brooch, remembering how special you felt when she gave it to you.

Home has felt like a lot lately, with many responsibilities and tasks to manage. You might be cleaning out closets or rearranging furniture to make the space more functional. As you do, it’s natural to feel sentimental. This process may help you determine what’s worth keeping, both financially and emotionally, and what no longer has a place in your life. Once you declutter, you’ll likely feel a renewed sense of peace in your environment.

Work has recently picked up, and you may have experienced unexpected changes or disruptions in your schedule. There could be shifts happening at your job, restructured departments or redefined roles. It’s a time to stay flexible and take initiative. Consider outlining your accomplishments and updating your list of skills, just in case you need to advocate for your role or explore other opportunities.

Even though your work life may feel uncertain (as it does for many right now), your relationships are thriving. If you’re married, it could feel like a second honeymoon. If you’ve been dating someone, an engagement could be on the horizon. And even at work, your boss sees you in a great light. If you’re single, this could be the week you meet someone truly special.

**Aquarius Rising:**

This Full Moon offers insight into your personal journey for the years to come. With the moon in your first house, the focus is on how you relate to your friends, family, and co-workers. Where do you fit into your relationships? How do you want to move forward? Who belongs in your inner circle? These are the kinds of questions you may be contemplating now.

Some answers could come from your role in the community. You might be rethinking how you show up in your neighborhood or in public spaces. There could be a pull to volunteer or to enroll in classes you once put off. You may discover cultural or educational institutions nearby that you’ve never explored, places like planetariums, museums, historic homes, or serene sanctuaries.

You might find yourself in a heart-to-heart conversation with your romantic partner. If things have gone stale or if you both see the future differently, now is the time to talk. I’m not saying you should break up, but without honest and thoughtful discussions, the relationship could suffer. Know where you’re flexible and where you’re not before initiating the conversation.

Even so, you’re optimistic about your daily life. You may be beautifying your workspace, hanging up photos of your pet, or seeking work that brings meaning and joy. There’s even a possibility of a workplace romance, so approach that carefully, just as you would with any indulgence.

**Pisces Rising:**

The house of personal insight is illuminated by the Aquarius Full Moon. You may gain spiritual clarity, especially around the human condition and the greater purpose of life. You might feel like retreating inward, tapping into your unconscious, and seeking a more enlightened perspective. You naturally want healing and light for everyone, and current world events could feel especially heavy. Understanding that life moves in cycles, and that existence extends beyond this incarnation, may offer some peace.

Financially, things might be tight. You may have dipped into savings recently to cover bills or unexpected expenses. This is a good time to take action around resources. Consider picking up a side gig or finally clearing out the attic, basement, or garage and selling what you don’t need. Even a few extra hours a week could help ease financial pressure.

Although inflation is real, you may want to review your home for opportunities to reduce unnecessary costs. It might be something small, like replacing weather stripping to lower electric bills or using solar film on your windows. Habits like leaving the water running or lights on add up. Small tweaks and handling issues early can support your long-term savings.

Where you’ll find luck is in self-expression. Spend time with family and friends this week. If you’re creative, write a song, paint, draw, or dress in a way that reflects your inner child. Even if you’re not a performer, it’s a great time to try karaoke. Joy, love, and gratitude will carry you far right now. And if you’re looking for romance, someone special could appear, but you have to be out there to meet them. Or maybe a friend has someone in mind who’s just your type.

Cameron Chase hadn't been able to sleep at all in the days since she escaped the collapsing Tycho Industries tower, the unconscious body of Thea Merlyn slung over her shoulder. The crumbling ceilings and collapsing floors echoed through her body in bruises and aches that never went away. Her eyes were heavy, and the fleeting moments where exhaustion caught her unaware seemed to be the only times she was truly able to find any sort of rest.

Thea Merlyn, on the other hand, experienced the other side of exhaustion. She was barely awake for more than a few hours per day, recovering from her injuries — all of which were much more severe than what Cameron had experienced. Most of which were inflicted by Cameron herself, with the help of Simon Tycho. She didn't leave Merlyn to fester in her damaged body; she provided as much care as she could with what little resources she could find in the DEO safe-room, but the temptation to just leave her for dead within the ruins of Tycho Industries weighed heavily. Perhaps it would have been a mercy.

The second, unknown Kryptonian had dropped Tycho's body from hundreds of feet in the air, leaving nothing but the splatter of brain matter and artificial organs strewn across National City's main square. She didn't stay to ensure that Tycho's paste was dead, nor to make her presence known — she crushed an insect and proceeded to destroy its hive. She retrieved Kara Zor-El and, by the time Cameron had reached ground level with Thea thrown over her shoulder, she returned to reduce Tycho's tower to rubble. The dust kicked up by the collapse was still floating over National City, days later.

Cameron kept the news on, waiting for the panicked call to come in, watching as the numbers were reported: a dozen missing, six times that in injuries, but only three confirmed deaths. Some part of her figured she wasn't important enough — or, perhaps, physically strong enough — to be called in among the first wave of DEO agents. Maybe, she thought, they knew she was safe and hidden, and covered other bases. There was still a pang in her chest when she realized that the call wasn't going to come. 

Thea Merlyn stirred, and Cameron had to maintain her composure. She wasn't sure what to feel anymore. Brawling outside of her own home felt minuscule in comparison. She couldn't say she was anxious about the Tycho re-assignment; it felt like she was supposed to be gearing up for something confrontational, but not deadly. ARGO was floundering without Kara at the head, and without Veritas at the lab and Thea indisposed, it was only Cameron and Belinda. There was no point in sticking around. The lab was all but abandoned. The re-assignment was easy to take. It would only last a few days, she was told. She was only there to intercept Thea Merlyn.

Cameron had thrown up in the safe-house restroom twice since the tower came down.
The cuff around Thea's left arm jingled, catching Cameron's attention. Her gaze was met with a grin stretched across Merlyn's face, ever smug even in the lowest of moments.

""Do you know what's going to happen because of your espionage?"" Cameron asked, trying to quell her anger at simply seeing Thea's face. ""Do you have any idea what chain of events you've set in motion because you wanted to play hero and steal from the richest man on the planet?""

""Former,"" Thea muttered, blinking slowly and maintaining her smirk. ""He deserved what he got. He pushed everyone too hard. Just wish I coulda seen it.""

""He was ripped apart by a rabid Kryptonian we know nothing about,"" said Cameron. ""Tycho’s a stain on the ground in N.C. Square and his tower is clogging up peoples' lungs. That rogue alien is the kind of threat we would have seen the Justice Legion deal with, but now she's gone with Kara Zor-El to who-knows-where.""

""She's a bitch, but she's not insane,"" Thea said. Her smile faded a little as her eyes seemed to lose focus. ""She won't be a threat. Kara's got this handled.""

""I don't know if you were conscious enough to notice, but Kara Zor-El was slumped on the floor, passed out, last she was seen by *anyone.*"" Thea's expression soured, she tried to shake her head slightly. ""I need you to understand what the fuck is happening, Thea."" 

There was a prolonged moment of silence between the two. Neither even looked at each other as the reporters for National City News droned on about the damage done to the city and the response by police, fire crews, and paramedics. It became overwhelming.
""It's her mother,"" said Thea. ""Kara can get through to her.""

Cameron leaned forward in her seat, clasping her hands together as she rested her elbows on her knees. She let out a deep sigh as her eyes found themselves looking through the windows at the dust and debris around the centre of the city, and the blank skyline where Tycho Industries used to be. She frowned.

""*–ensure you have access to face coverings, water, and stay inside in well-ventilated areas–*""

Most of the workers at National City News that weren't on-screen or in the studio had been given the option to work from home, and nearly all had taken it. Very few came to the offices, and even fewer were in the bullpen as Nia sat at her desk, typing at her computer as she finished off her second bottle of water of the morning. Her piece about Kara Zor-El barely had time to float around on the internet before she assaulted Tycho Industries. Nia's heart sank further every second she had watched the disaster go on. As the tower was destroyed, she knew that public opinion was going to be impossible to wrestle back into Kara's favour any time soon.

She couldn't remember the last good sleep she'd had, at all, let alone within the days since Tycho's death. Her inbox had become entirely unmanageable, emails left and right from endless people, editors scrambling to make sense of which stories were worth even writing at this point in time. No one could keep up.

For but a moment, she allowed her eyes to shut, conceding for only a few seconds in the constant fight against the exhaustion she'd been feeling since she arrived on this Earth. Her typing stopped and she felt as though she could simply fall asleep sitting up, and in a split second it seemed like she wouldn't be able to open her eyes again, falling into a deep sleep.

Images flashed in front of her eyes. Fire and crumbling concrete, screams, a destroyed metal mask barely covering skin that was pulled back and split and altered by unknown technology. There was rage. A pang of fear gripped her chest as her eyes shot open with a gasp, turning her head toward the windows twenty feet behind her. She couldn't quite see what it was, but somewhere in the murky sky outside was a figure, floating in the air. After blinking once, Nia quickly realized that it was getting closer at an alarming speed.

Swivelling her head to search for anyone else within the bullpen, Nia stood and approached the window. She clenched her jaw tightly, thankful that the few others who had shown up to work had decided to all go on break at once. The light sound of hushed chatter from the direction of the break room gave her enough confidence to stare directly at the figure racing toward the National City News building.

She held her eyes shut as it approached. She reached out to the figure's mind, but instead of a waking mind, she found something different, something suppressed in a way that people in the waking world never were. There was no latent dream energy to pull from, nothing to glean from the mind racing toward her, just emptiness.

Nia cocked her head, keeping her eyes shut as she found the napping intern on the second floor of her building, yanking on his dreams to form a portal directly in front of the window Nia stood in front of, a mere second before impact. Whoever it was that had been barrelling toward Nia would have fun being dropped harmlessly into the dream of a nineteen year old living with the stress of school and ultra-powerful aliens.

Nia sat back down at her desk and rested her head in her hands, closing her eyes again as she moved into a comfortable position. With nearly no effort, no need to look at her surroundings, she reached into her purse and pulled out a bottle of melatonin tablets. Slipping one into her mouth, she took a deep breath and pressed into the dreams of the intern over half a dozen floors below her.

A wave of weightlessness passed over Nia as she entered, fully costumed in her Dreamer attire, and was met with the face of the intern, terrified, dirtied, and bloodied. He had a young, pockmarked face and deep brown eyes. His wavy brown hair was caked in dirt and sweat, some stuck to his forehead. He was breathing heavily, struggling to lift himself up.

It took Nia a moment to realize just what he was dreaming about. She recognized the streets around her. He was buried under the rubble of Tycho Industries, clouds of dust and smoke obscuring the sky as the red eyes of a silhouette high above looked down upon him. Nia knelt down in front of him.

""Hey,"" she said to him, trying to keep her voice soft and calm. He barely turned his head toward her, keeping his hands on a large chunk of concrete pressing down on his back and over his head. She grabbed onto the destroyed slab and lifted slightly, giving him room to breathe. ""You'll be alright."" He looked up at her, the intense fear clashing with the relief of help.

""Please,"" he begged, barely able to speak. ""Help me… I'm stuck…""

""I know,"" she said, lifting the slab with nearly no effort. ""But I'll need your help too.""

""What?"" he asked, his breathing quickening.

""I need you to help me lift,"" she said, wrapping her hands around another large piece of debris covering him. ""And I'll need you to help me beat him."" As she tossed the debris away, seeing the intern pushing it away from below, she then turned toward the silhouette in the sky and pointed toward it.

""Beat–? How? Who are you? Are you insane?""

""I'm not,"" said Nia, offering a hand to him to help him stand. ""But this is your dream, and he's not from it. You have all the power here.""

""Do I?"" he asked, looking around at his surroundings. ""It doesn't feel like it.""

""It may not, but you do,"" Nia replied. She put a hand on his shoulder and offered a smile. ""It was born out of your fear, and I know it's damn terrifying to see what happened here, but *here,* you have the ability to change things if you just try."" He gave her an odd look.

""Okay. Yeah,"" he said blankly. ""Sure. Okay. Wh-What do you need?""

""I'll need you to wake up on my signal,"" she said. ""You'll know when that is.""

""Just wake up? On command?""

""Once you're aware, it's a lot easier than you think."" The boy simply nodded. Nia saw the uncertainty in his eyes and simply needed him to play along. It was easier than explaining the exact details of her presence. ""I'll be off,"" she said, jumping up and zipping into the sky, rushing toward the silhouette.

Drawing upon the dream she currently existed within, she balled up energy within the fist she drew back and launched a strong strike at the silhouette's face, pushing her entire body into the strike. It reeled back, knocked from a trance it seemed to be in, and screamed as it shot further into the sky, moving for almost a hundred feet before it managed to re-stabilize itself in the air.

Nia shook her fist, still feeling the impact upon its metal mask, which was now split, revealing the left side of a man's face. There was no visible hair on his head or face, only the ripped, scarred, and stretched skin around his temple and jaw, leading to a series of cybernetic wires and connection ports that seemed to attach to his helmet.

Pausing at the sight, Nia stopped for only just enough time to allow the man to rocket toward her, delivering a deft strike toward her stomach a split second after she'd realized what he was doing. She tried to interfere in his mind, but the void where his thoughts should have been rejected her. It was only after the strike, when she was propelled out of the dream and back into the waking world, when she felt a small spark try to ignite a fire within.

But it was still a void, and as she was launched back into the waking world, the strike she'd endured propelled her backward toward the windows of the National City News bullpen. Within a second, from sleeping at her desk, she was sent flying out of the building, plummeting down nearly a dozen storeys toward the hard ground below.

With only two seconds to spare before impact, she found the mind of the sleeping intern and collapsed his dream, forcing him awake as if he'd jolted up from a dream of falling a great distance. As a result, the armoured man was forcefully ejected into the world, sent crashing through the walls of the National City News building and into the side street Nia was about to hit at nearly thirty metres per second.

Using the energy from the dream she'd collapsed, she formed a portal upon her would-be point of impact and seamlessly fell through, transporting herself up to the roof of the very building she'd fallen from. Maintaining her momentum, she hit the roof hard, feeling the impact all down her body as she rolled and skidded along.

Coming to a stop, she twisted onto her stomach and watched the opposite end of the building in wait for the man to return, and, just as she had expected, he reappeared in the air. Unlike before, however, she could feel something emanating from him, she could feel it in her stomach, threatening to bring back up the water she had been drinking and the small snacks she was feeding herself instead of meals. There was a yellow glow emitting from his hands as various wires and tubes around him seemed to feed something into his hands.

Nia searched for nearby sleepers, finding numerous minds to feed off of.
Reopening a portal below her, the last thing she saw was a beam of yellow light eviscerate the roof she'd been laying on.

She breathed deeply as she felt the cold floors of the Fortress of Solitude.

""Nia Nal?"" asked the voice of Alura In-Ze. ""What are you doing here?""

Nia froze as she looked up from where she laid, just inside the entrance to the fortress. Only a few metres away was where Alura stood, holding a steaming mug of coffee in each hand. She looked down at Nia with something between indifference and contempt.

""Someone attacked me,"" said Nia, pushing herself up off the ground. ""They're in National City.""

""Is that not up to you to deal with?"" asked Alura, giving the slightest head shake to indicate that she thought her statement was obvious. Nia held back an eye roll and exasperated scoff.

""They found me at work,"" said Nia. ""It's not like there was anywhere else for me to go if they know what to look for. If Kara's up to it, I'd like to get her help with this.""

""You expect her to fight your battles?"" asked Alura, furrowing her brow.

""*Help*, I said. Things have been pretty bad lately,"" said Nia, looking around the fortress in hopes of seeing where Kara was, at a glance.

""She can't help you right now,"" Alura said. ""She's still recovering. You can handle this yourself."" Alura tried to turn around and walk away, but Nia followed behind.

""I know that,"" Nia called out. ""But punching things isn't the only thing I'd like help with. I don't know what this guy's deal was, but I haven't seen it before. Maybe she could figure out what it was.""

""I don't think she's in a state to expend that kind of energy.""

""I'm going to be honest with you, Alura, I don't give a crap what you think,"" Nia said. Alura stopped walking in front of her, and, in turn, Nia walked out in front of her friend's mother. ""I'm not going to let you stonewall me from seeing Kara. You've had her here for days with Kryptonian technology. I refuse to believe that she's completely unable to move and think.""

""It's not that she's unable to, it's that I believe she needs more time to recover,"" said Alura, tensing her jaw. ""But, so be it. You may see her. Through that door."" Alura gestured toward a large set of doors across the room as she sipped on a coffee in the opposite hand. ""I'm sure she will be very glad to see you, Nia Nal.""

Nia sighed and turned around, walking in a rush through the doors and into the large room on the other side. In the midst of various technologies that Nia didn't understand, Kara laid in the centre, on a small slab of a bed underneath a full rack of red sun lamps. Various clothes, dishes, and waste items were strewn about nearby.

""Kara!"" Nia called out, rushing forward and meeting her friend.

""Nia,"" Kara muttered, a barely perceptible smile creeping onto her face. ""What are you doing here? What happened to you?""

Nia looked down at herself to see dust, glass, and small amounts of blood over her clothes. She glanced back at Kara and offered a sheepish smile before sighing deeply.

""Something came after me at N.C.N.,"" she said. ""I don't know who or what it was, but it made a beeline for me. I figured I'd come and let you know, just in case you might know what it is and how to stop it.""

""Nia, I've been out of it for days,"" said Kara. ""I don't know anything about what's going on in National City."" Nia sighed and bit the inside of her lip. Kara sat up and crossed her legs. ""What did it look like?""

""You remember Thorn?"" asked Nia. Kara's face turned grim as she nodded. ""A little bit like her. Stretched skin, cybernetics, the whole thing. But he had this suit of armour on, like a… I don't know, black like a stealth jet or something. And his mind was almost entirely empty, as if he wasn't even home but… there were sparks. I don't know who or what he is, but he's clearly not in control of his mind.""

""Thorn was taken in by that Agent that's been stalking me all this time,"" said Kara turning her eyes away to think for a moment.

""Do you think the government is sending people after us, now?"" asked Nia.

""I wouldn't be surprised…"" Kara said. ""Cameron was at Tycho's headquarters, before… She had Thea. We need to figure out what's going on.""

""So you're coming?""

""Of course I am,"" Kara said. ""Can you help me get into the sunlight?""",1,1754525911.0,DCNext,0,1.0,False
1mjlbt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1mjlbt1/what_would_you_do_in_this_situation/,what would YOU do in this situation?,"in the third bimester of the year of our LORD twenty twenty three i started seeing a girl from my very small uni where everyone knows everyone, and i mean ""seeing"" literally: all we did was sit next to each other in silence, and we did that for a couple of months until i pretty much ghosted her. i felt bad for that, she's younger than me and i was her very first ""romantic"" experience, so one day i met her at the uni's library, apologised and everything went well. i then asked her a question:  
""hey... i'm kinda interested in one of your friends, wouldja mind if i talked to her?""  
she smiled, her rubenesque red cheeks shining under the library's radioactive fluorescent lights ""no, i don't mind, go ahead!""  
the friend in question had chaperoned my smiley ex-date to the library, and was standing away from us, looking through a book of oboe sheet music which i'm pretty sure she couldn't understand. let's call her Green. i didn't really know she existed until i started seeing her friend, but once i met her i developed the obesest crush i think i ever had on someone since high school. one day she stopped me to ask something about a class we were taking together and i almost had a stroke. one day she smiled at me when i got into the elevator and i almost cried. every time i see her i feel like digging myself into a hole and hiding forever. why are women so pretty and so nice. it's not fair  
anyfuckingway, what happened is that i got intimidated by the magnitude of my infatuation and pussied out and ended up asking another one of my ex-date's friends (who i also think it's cute, but not as much as Green) out instead and she said no. i now hear you ask ""but why did you do that? are you stupid?"" i don't know and yes. the first issue appears: i would personally feel weird hitting on multiple people from the same friend group. i don't know exactly why, it just feels wrong to me. i even tried texting Green once but deleted it before she saw or answered.  
a couple of months later Green started dating one of her friends, which was not my ex-date nor the one i invited out, but a third secret girl. at that point i had already kinda given up on Green and i ain't gonna lie, she and her gf were cute together, so i just stopped thinking about her for a while.

**\[intermission\]**

my ex came to me at the end of twenty twenty three by way of leaving flattering comments under my drawings on instagram. contrary to Green, she is very hard to look at. she's unhealthly skinny with a huge, gummy mouth full of long yellow teeth and a big head covered by thin, wavy tousled hair that comes out very agressively from the top of her round skull. she's also extremely white, her skin reminding me of a dead, raw chicken. when i first took a good look at her in person, i immediately thought of a cross between smeagol and the rat guy from harry potter, but i never told her any of that. she didn't have the same decency. she told me with all the words that she found me ugly and that she was ashamed of being seen with me. there were times when i would literally beg to be close to her, to do anything with her and she would say no. she only ever did anything to or for me if it would bring a benefit to her. our relationship happened mostly in secret. her friends don't know anything of what she did to me, on the contrary, they were constantly telling her to stop talking to me. i, however, love a funny and kinda weird woman, and i can be pretty mean myself, so i tried to be cool and selfless about it and make it work many times, but it was never worth it.

**\[end of intermission\]**

the year is twenty twenty five, Green and her gf broke up and now my ex and Green are working together making props and sets at the fuckass uni opera club. Green and my ex and my ex's friends are friends now, and i just know my ex is into her (i can read her mind). hahahaha that's so funny isn't it guys. l.m.f.a.o, as they say.  
that's the second, and presently, the biggest problem: my ex's friends lowkey hate me and i'm afraid they'll bad-mouth me to Green if i try anything. i'm also afraid that my ex will think that, if i invite Green out or whatever, i'll be doing it to ""get"" to her somehow. as you might have picked up from the intermission, our relationship was not very good. some might even say it was abusive. i honestly don't know what she thinks of me, if anything. i also have a feeling that Green might be a lesbian, but let's not think about that now.  
can anyone who's better at being a person help me navigate this? i've been infatuated with Green for a long time, and i really wish GOD wasn't doing everything in it's power to drag her away from me and that i could just talk to her normally, but i have all these obstacles in front of me, and even if i did talk to her i don't even know what i would say. i don't think ""hey, i know i made a pass on two of your friends already but i've been secretly crushing on you for almost two years sorry i never said anything lol anyway wanna go grab a coffee or smt? also if my ex says anything abt me please dont believe her ok"" would work.  
i know the ""right"" answer would probably be for me to say fuck it and do whatever i want, but i can't... i won't be able to bear the shame of being seen as someone who preys on similar women from the same friend groups like a serial killer. i also don't want my ex and her friends to start spreading rumours about me. maybe no one cares and i might be thinking about myself a little too much, but who the FUCK else am i supposed to be thinking of? it's an eat or be eaten world baby",2,1754525777.0,rs_x,3,0.67,False
1mjlbc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1mjlbc7/tw_feeling_stuck/,TW: Feeling stuck,"I just want to go on a quick rant… pretty much my whole childhood my parents was on drugs, I was raising my brother, worried about a next meal because my mom always sold our food-stamps for drugs, we moved back in with family a year later, we was doing fine until I hit around 12-13 then the whole house was on drugs, so I went to the school and told them what was going on and they called my grandparents.

Dhr and the cops was at the house I was picked up by my grandfather and we went to my house to pick out things up. I don’t remember much of staying with them I just knew things were more strict, no going out with friends, no having friends over, I couldn’t even go to football games.. fast forward 2 months (im 14 by this time) I met a guy started to sneak him in or go out to see him (of course I ended up getting caught) got grounded my grandfather went through my phone said that I was disgusting/vulgar etc and was told that I was going to be just like my mom.

I brought my grades up just enough to get my devices back and I did it all again, this time I didn’t get caught. My aunt had just got a new position offer a few hours away so we went there to stay for a week because we had just got let out for Covid so we didn’t mind going… we hung out by the lake for a few days, talked to each other, but when I was talking to my cousin I thought I could trust her and tell her that I had snuck out again, well I did and it went left, she texted her parents they called my grandparents so I grabbed my phone and just started walking.

I walked for an hour or two in the woods got lost, decided to call 911 for assistance to get back, they were already passing by the woods looking for me, they started using their sirens to lead me back to the campsite, I found a couple of officers on the way and they walked me back. When we finally got back my grandmother was standing right in front of the camper door yelling and shouting, just a lot of unnecessary drama, I didn’t want to deal with it so I told the police I wanted to 💀 myself, they asked me was I sure I said yes (they knew I was just saying it just to get away but it was for valid reasons).


The ambulance got there I left and went to the hospital for a couple of days, I did nothing but sleep for the whole two days that I was there, everyone was certain it would all blow over but it didn’t, the doctor came in and said that my grandparents didn’t want me back that I had to figure something else out, so they suggested a group home or a mental hospital, I went with mental hospital because I had no idea what a group home was. We drove another couple of hours to get there and the moment we walked through The Doors I was petrified, people screaming, fighting, anything you name it, the paramedics said “I’ll be praying for you, I hope everything works out for you.”

It didn’t, I stayed for two years my caseworker asked did I want to go to a group home but I already knew the program here so there was no point, for once I finally felt okay, making good grades, no devices other than school computers, it finally felt okay.

The last year I was there was my birthday, my grandparents and everyone else came to visit me, they brought gifts and stuff and we had a talk, my grandparents didn’t want me back, but my aunt was willing to let me come live with her.

We started to have multiple family therapy sessions just so I could be released to her and home visits, the only thing stopping was a house, it didn’t take long of course it only took about a month the most but it still felt like a long time.


Fast forward I finally got discharged, had a two hour drive, but we went out to eat at a Korean restaurant, it was the best I’ve ever had, and talked all the way home, when I got home all I wanted to do was sleep, I hadn’t been able to sleep in for two years so I figured I’d take advantage of it, but of course I had nightmares of the hospital.

Me and my aunt never had any issues until she had weight loss surgery and started going after a bunch of men, I was having to miss work for her, or watch her child, even one time had a guy come over and he wouldn’t leave, my cousin ended up going home because my aunt made her change her shorts.

The biggest argument I’ll never forget what she said to me “I don’t want you anymore I can just call dhr” we both just went to our rooms I cried for awhile, she ended up coming and apologizing saying should have never said that.

Not long after that all of her employees got Covid, so she had to find someone to help her with work, a guy came down from where my grandparents lived, and he started to work with her until everyone got better. She came home saying he asked her to go out for coffee but she seen he was married and declined.

At some point she just completely disregarded that he was married i don’t know when she never told me, but she came in one day saying she was so upset because he told her that he called the suicide hotline before and she didn’t have a response for it so he got mad, I told her that didn’t seem like a good guy.

She still continued to talk to him without anyone knowing, then right before school was about to end she said we was moving back to where it all started but didn’t give a reason why.

We moved two months later, the house still needed some work but it didn’t take long, she wasn’t home often at all I was always babysitting. A couple weeks later she brought the married guy home, and it never stopped, then it quickly went to overnights, and eventually he moved in.

My grandparents didn’t like him because they knew he was married, even ran into them in the grocery store and embarrassed them both, eventually they came around because he told the story of “my wife is crazy our marriage hasn’t worked in a long time, the only reason I haven’t divorced her is because she has cancer” crazy right?

Not even a whole year later she purposefully planned a baby, of course I wasn’t happy about it I had just found the test, so I told my family, everyone was so pissed off at me for doing that because she ended up having a miscarriage but how was any of that right? 

I told them I wanted to move out soon and they promised they’d have my back no matter what, I just didn’t want to deal with all of it anymore, it wasn’t a family anymore it was just dysfunctional.

I finally moved out with my bf, they were no longer speaking to me until I got pregnant, I went for Christmas they still got me something even though I told everyone I didn’t want anything, I tried to repair my relationship with my aunt from my 2nd trimester up until I had my baby. everyone was saying my bf was a bum he wasn’t going to be there he heard it all and my grandfather tried to deny it. I was paying them to borrow the car they took it when they found out I was pregnant.

Currently now going on in my life I’m in a domestic violence relationship, always being cheated on, living with his narcissist psycho mom who always has a problem with everything I do even when I stay out of the way, I don’t have a car, I have a part time job to keep my baby safe. sometimes I look back on what I had and wished it would’ve worked out, but I tried and I tried I didn’t want to tell my aunt I was being abused when she asked but it seemed like that would’ve been the only way she would’ve let me come back.

So I'd been diagnosed with ADHD as an adult about a couple years ago, I'm 28 now. My parents -especially my mum's side- also have an history of it. Point is, I got started on the highest dose of Concerta available here, which was too much, so after a bit of playing along with dosages I set on 45mg (18mg + 27mg), which was the most tolerable Concerta dose for me as 36 was too low.

However I started noticing a pattern of anhedonia (loss in previously loved activities; I quit playing guitar, and all I would do was being 100% focused on work and couldn't get it out of my head) as well as, importantly, a loss of libido which was very pronounced. So, after speaking to my doctor, who at first suggested atomoxetine, I mentioned if we could try Elvanse (brand name for Vyvanse in Europe) since he'd brought it up before. And we did, he put me on 30mg Elvanse to take early in the AM.

So far, I feel much better in almost all departments, except for energy. I think my body may be used to the ""forced stimulation"" that Concerta provided, whereas Elvanse makes my thoughts calm down, but I feel like I need to take a cup of coffee (I always did that with Concerta, but I need to ask my doc if it's fine to take it with Elvanse). I prefer to work out when the meds are not in my system yet for the same reason (heart strain).

**tl;dr dropped Concerta for Elvanse, so far miles better, but Concerta made me more alert upon kicking in**

Has any of you found the same thing, with Elvanse/Vyvanse being much, much better for you, but also, not as ""slap in the face"" wakefulness-inducing as Concerta?",1,1754525469.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Hey GPTApp fam! 😊

Can we take a moment to appreciate how wild it is that process automation—once the top secret weapon for Fortune 500 titans—has become accessible to startups, side hustlers, and even solo entrepreneurs all over the globe? Seriously, it’s electrifying to watch!

Let’s be real:  
- If your workflow isn’t at least *a little* automated in 2024, aren’t you just begging for burnout?  
- How many times have you caught yourself thinking, “Didn’t I already do this... 15 minutes ago?” while slogging through some repetitive admin task?

The way I see it, automation is more than just a tech upgrade.  
It’s:
- A recipe for claiming back your hours.
- A chance to unleash creativity instead of living in “copy/paste” land.
- Your ticket to scaling up, not just getting by.

Here are a few ways I’ve seen automation instantly brighten up everyone’s day:

- Have your invoices send themselves (like magic!).  
- Watch customer support requests get routed, tracked, and responded to—no more inbox avalanches.  
- Get inventory updates at the speed of thought (and avoid those out-of-stock oopsies).

And here’s where things start to get *really* interesting:  
When you connect cloud apps, AI tools, and APIs, you can create end-to-end flows that work while you sleep! (Automated client onboarding, anyone?) Suddenly, you wake up, sip your coffee, and realize your business almost ran itself overnight. Pure joy!

Some quick wins you can try even with minimal code:
- Zapier or Make scenarios that process new orders automatically
- Gmail filters that fire off templated replies to customer FAQs
- AI chatbots that answer the top 10 questions before your phone rings

But here’s my favorite part—it’s not about “getting rid” of humans.  
It’s about freeing people’s minds to work *on* the business instead of *in* it.  
You’re not replacing jobs—you’re letting yourself (and others) level up, dream bigger, and create value where it really counts.

So let’s talk:  
- What’s the next soul-crushing repetitive task on your kill list?  
- Which automation has made you do a happy dance at your desk?  
- Where are you stuck in the labyrinth, hoping for an “automate me” button?

Hit me with your love stories (or war stories) from the automation frontier!  
Let’s cheer each other on while we reclaim our most precious resource: time. 🎉

I also enjoy drawing/creating art, hanging out in coffee shops, and getting outside for hikes when the weather isn’t trying to melt us. Would be cool to find some people to chill with, hit up conventions or game nights, or just grab coffee /a drink!

I’ve spent all of this week crying and I am not eating or drinking very much at all. I may have a coffee in the morning but I’ll drink half. I may have a bite or two of food, but that’s it. I feel weak. I feel horrible. Emotionally and physically. I look terrible. This is a very heavy situation. 

Obviously the MJ is compounding my loss of appetite. For the last few months I’ve lost 1-2kg a month max. This week I have lost 2kg in a matter of days. 

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced grief or trauma while on MJ and did you feel OK health wise? How did you get through it? 

I know this will pass but it’s weird going from being a former emotional eater to now being in the complete opposite state. I always wondered how people lost weight during stressful times … now I am one of them, but it’s not healthy and I can feel it.

From the very beginning, I made my intentions clear, and she's fully aware of my feelings. Initially, our conversations were engaging, fun, and quite intimate. We complimented each other frequently, had enjoyable exchanges, and even made plans to meet up for coffee, which she accepted enthusiastically.

However, shortly after she agreed to the coffee date, she had to unexpectedly travel out of town due to work commitments. Since then, things started to feel a bit confusing. She sometimes responds warmly and promptly, maintaining a friendly vibe, but at other times she takes hours or even days to reply or doesn't reply at all. She explained that she’s incredibly busy at work and going through an intense adaptation period in her life, which makes it hard for her to keep up with messages. Despite this, she remains active on social media, regularly posting updates and tweets.

In our last interaction, I openly mentioned that I felt I was always the one initiating conversations and asked her if she genuinely wanted to keep the communication going. She assured me that her sporadic responses were solely due to her workload and adaptation stress, and she didn't harbor any negative feelings toward me. Notably, she warmly responded to a flower photo I sent her, jokingly saying, ""I assumed it was meant for me.""

I’ve been in the military for almost 5 years now and before I joined I had already showed signs of PTSD, Anxiety, and Depression. I never really went to therapy before I joined the military and even since I’ve joined I’ve only done addiction counseling. 

The very first anxiety/panic attack I had was back in February. Me and my wife were sitting in Starbucks sipping our coffee and scrolling through our phones when all of the sudden it’s like I had tunnel vision and then everything stopped for a second. When I came to my senses my heart was beating at an insane rate and I was sweating profusely. I jumped back in my chair and grabbed my chest. I looked at my wife and I said “Something is wrong”. My wife has been around things like this before and she knew my mental health was deteriorating over the past months so I think she immediately knew I was having an anxiety attack. I kept freaking out and told her to ask someone to call 911 because it felt like I was about to die. Instead she sat with me in the corner of this Starbucks and held me while I caught my breath. One of the cashiers came to check on me and reassured me that everything was okay and he too suffered from attacks like these. He gave me water and let me sit there a while. 

Since this incident I’ve had anxiety attacks alot. Smells, noises, pictures, lights, random bodily aches can set them off. Yesterday I had one so bad I spent most of the day in the hospital and it was very painful. I was just sitting in my car at the time watching TikTok and just started to feel odd. I was more scared than I have ever been in my life. The doctors at the hospital asked me a bunch of questions and before they discharged me the only thing they really recommended was therapy. 

I have a lot of trauma and I will not deny this but the thought that therapy can just fix all of this is beyond me. Is there a root to my anxiety? Can anxiety be cured? This is incredibly scary to me and I’ve been through some scary stuff. I’m going next week to set up an appointment with a therapist, however that will work. But does therapy genuinely help this? Is something the matter with me that they will get to the bottom of and make these attacks less intense? I’m just in need of some advice. This is all so new to me and I have much respect for people that deal with this. ",1,1754524825.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I want us to feel that magnetic and emotional pull — like the minute we lock eyes, the world becomes outside noise.

I’m 31, 5’4, Japanese-American, HWP (height weight proportionate), with long dark brown hair and bangs, and dark brown almond-shaped eyes. I’m very in touch with my feminine side. I’m based in Los Angeles and work as an instructional assistant at an elementary school while pursuing my Early Childhood Education Units, building a meaningful career in education.

A bit about me: I take care of myself and often get mistaken for being in my twenties (not going to lie, it’s fun). I love coastal drives, bookstores, traveling, writing (currently working on a horror-romance novel), and losing myself in synthwave - Right now, *Chromance* by Kalax is on repeat. My favorite 2000s films are *The Girl Next Door (2004)*, and *Freaky Friday (2003)*. I don’t smoke or use drugs, and I drink minimally.

I love good morning texts, consistency, honesty, and emotional depth. I want the kind of romance where you pick me up at my door with flowers, and as the night ends, you’re already asking, “So, when can I see you again?” No guessing games. No one left wondering or waiting.

I want a romance that makes my heart race at 100 miles per hour, where we laugh endlessly, trust and respect each other fully, and I wipe the lipstick off your lips after every kiss. I want to feel the spark, fire, and passion - as well as the stability and calmness that comes from knowing we’re truly right for each other. I want a romance that burns so bright all because it feels so right.

I want us to feel like we’re 21 again - Full of excitement and possibility - yet with the emotional stability of adults who know who they are. I’m looking for someone who isn’t just a fantasy, but feels like my best friend and someone I’ve known my whole life. Tattoos and leather jackets are a bonus; I have three tattoos myself. Together, we could be like James Dean and Audrey Hepburn.

I’m looking for a man who is in touch with his masculine side but is highly emotionally intelligent and respectful. I like a guy with a bit of a bad boy edge - Tattoos, leather jackets, maybe a motorcycle - but who is still a respectful, grounded, and decent man at heart. Someone who always follows through with what he says, has his own life, passions, and goals, and takes care of himself physically and emotionally. Between 30–40, tall, stable, obviously single, and carrying a dark, intriguing edge. You don’t smoke (weed, cigarettes, vaping, etc.) or use drugs. You treat wait staff with the same kindness and respect you’d show anyone else. Monogamy only.

I don’t have children, and I’d prefer you don’t either - but I would love to have kids someday, so it’s important that we’re on the same page about marriage and the future. Tattoos, cars and/or motorcycles, leather jackets, and basic common sense and literacy are a HUGE bonus!

And please: send intentional, thoughtful messages. Not “hey,” “what’s up,” or “m 38. Got a pic?” Effort matters. I want a man who texts and talks like a GROWN MAN.

Picture us: riding off into the sunset on your motorcycle, laughing while we run errands together like it’s our own private inside joke, or sitting quietly at an overlook watching the city lights below - Knowing we’re exactly where we belong. And maybe later that night, we’re back under the neon glow of Los Angeles, kissing like the whole world has disappeared. Beyond that, we’ll explore LA together - From hidden coffee shops to city lights and coastal adventures - Making memories in every corner of this city.

**Note:** I’d prefer if you were in Los Angeles or Orange County - But if you’re in the US, you're absolutely welcome to reach out. If you’re in another country, it might be harder to make this work.

If you feel that spark reading this, send me a thoughtful message - And yes, include a photo. Chemistry matters, and I want to know if we’ll light up the screen together.",3,1754524605.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

## Key Features Analysis

The latest bluetooth printers come packed with features designed to enhance productivity and user experience.

**Connectivity Options**

modern bluetooth printers feature a robust suite of wireless connectivity options,ensuring seamless integration with a wide range of devices. Beyond standard bluetooth 5.0, many models now incorporate Wi-Fi Direct, allowing for direct connection to smartphones and tablets even without a local Wi-Fi network. Additionally, NFC (Near Field Communication) pairing simplifies the connection process, enabling users to instantly connect their devices by simply tapping them against the printer.Some high-end models include cloud printing capabilities, allowing users to print documents from anywhere in the world via services like Google Cloud Print or Apple AirPrint.**Print Quality and Resolution**

Today's bluetooth printers offer impressive print quality that rivals conventional wired models.Resolution plays a key role, with many printers boasting resolutions of up to 4800 x 1200 dpi (dots per inch). This high resolution ensures that text is sharp and clear,while images display vibrant colors and fine details. Inkjet models utilize advanced ink formulations that resist smudging and fading, guaranteeing long-lasting prints. Thermal printers, often used for receipts and labels, offer excellent durability and resistance to environmental factors. The enhanced print quality makes these printers suitable for both professional documents and personal photos.

Portability is a defining characteristic of bluetooth printers. Compact designs and lightweight constructions make them easy to carry in a backpack or briefcase. Many models feature built-in rechargeable batteries, allowing for truly wireless operation. These batteries often provide enough power to print dozens or even hundreds of pages on a single charge. Durability is also an important consideration, with manufacturers using rugged materials and reinforced components to withstand the rigors of travel and daily use. Some models are even designed to be water-resistant or shockproof, making them ideal for use in challenging environments.

**Print Speed and Volume**

Print speed is crucial for maximizing productivity, and modern bluetooth printers deliver impressive performance in this area. Print speeds are typically measured in pages per minute (PPM), and many models offer speeds of up to 10-15 PPM for black and white documents and 5-8 PPM for color documents. First page out time is also an critically important metric, indicating how quickly the printer can produce the first page after receiving the print command.High-volume printing is supported by large paper trays that can hold up to 100 sheets of paper. Automatic document feeders (ADF) are also available on some models, allowing for unattended scanning and copying of multi-page documents.

**Mobile App Integration**

Most bluetooth printers come with dedicated mobile apps that extend their functionality and provide a user-friendly interface for controlling printer settings. These apps typically allow users to print documents, photos, web pages, and email directly from their smartphone or tablet. Advanced features include the ability to crop and edit images, adjust print settings, and monitor ink levels. some apps also offer cloud storage integration, allowing users to access and print documents stored in services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive. The mobile app integration enhances the overall user experience and makes it easy to manage printing tasks on the go.

Should Hungary Take Texas?

By Callie Blanco

“We bring real stew. Real bread. Real feeling.”
—The Hungarian Godzilla, standing in the ruins of a Viennese art gallery

About two weeks ago, my cousin down in Brenham sent me a TikTok of a lizard the size of a refinery belting out something in broken English across the rooftops of Budapest. It wasn’t AI. It wasn’t performance art. It was real.

And that lizard? He’s Hungarian now. Blue beret, big sad eyes, voice like a hoarse foghorn.

They call him the Hungarian Godzilla.

And apparently, he wants Vienna.

But watching him, one hand on his heart and the other hurling chunks of paprika-stained debris at a minimalist coffee shop, I found myself thinking something Texans probably shouldn’t say out loud:

Maybe Hungary should take us too.

⸻

Wait, What?

Let me explain.

Godzilla’s “Take Vienna” speech went viral because it hit a cultural nerve. He didn’t threaten violence, not really. What he did was shame the West for losing its soul.

No rugs in apartments. No taste in coffee. No memory of empire, or music, or even dinner done right.

And if we Texans are honest with ourselves — in between Whataburger runs and our sixth streaming true crime series of the week — we know we’ve got our own emptiness.

We paved over the past. Replaced meat with “brisket concepts.”

We bulldozed historic dance halls to build kombucha gyms.

We took the word “heritage” and used it to market barbecue restaurants owned by venture capitalists from Boston.

You think a Hungarian doesn’t notice?

⸻

A Monster with a Mission

Now, I’m not saying we hand over the keys to the state. I’m just saying… maybe we let Godzilla visit.

Set up in San Antonio. Do a cultural audit.

Because Hungary’s not coming with tanks. They’re coming with stew.

And that’s not a metaphor. They really mean it. The monster said so himself: “We bring real stew.”

If you’ve never had Hungarian gulyás cooked over open flame by a poet in exile, then you don’t know what spiritual heat tastes like.

They don’t do “options” over there. They do fate. And it tastes like smoked paprika and generational regret.

We could use a little of that. Maybe even a lot.

⸻

What Would a Hungarian Texas Look Like?

Not invaded. Not conquered. Seasoned.

Imagine if Austin stopped pretending to be Brooklyn and started pretending to be… 19th-century Debrecen.

Imagine if Buc-ee’s started selling fruit brandy, national epics, and hand-embroidered shawls alongside its Beaver Nuggets.

Imagine if instead of oil rigs, we had accordion towers.

If the monsters came not with flame but flavor. Not with bombs, but with poetry.

If, when someone said “Howdy,” they meant “I am willing to mourn with you beneath the mulberry tree.”

We wouldn’t be less Texan. We’d be more.

⸻

It’s About the Rugs

Godzilla’s most famous line from the Vienna speech—“You have no rugs!”—has been memed half to hell. But it stuck with me.

Why?

Because rugs matter.

They’re the fabric of memory. Something your grandmother hand-washed. Something your cousin got married on. Something you fought over during your divorce.

Texans used to have rugs. Big ones. Ugly ones. Honest ones.

Now we’ve got smooth concrete floors and vibes.

Hungary sees that. And Hungary weeps.

⸻

The Reckoning

So here’s the proposal: we let Hungary try.

Start small. Let ’em have El Paso for the winter. Give Amarillo a folk revival. Let Lubbock feel shame again.

Give Godzilla a big hat and a fiddle and see what happens.

At worst, he’ll accidentally destroy a Tesla charging station. At best, he might remind us how to feel something.

⸻

Final Thought

We don’t need to become Hungary. But maybe we let a little Hungary into us.

Because if a monster the size of a water tower can cry for Vienna, maybe we can cry for the things we paved over.

And maybe—just maybe—real stew is coming.

This was an incredible ride. Lots of fails, lots of fine-tuning, countless days spent working, but in the end it was all worth it. **Before telling you about this story, I'd like to tell you bit about my family and the idea that sparked this project**



# How it all started

I was born in 🇮🇹 [Bari, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari), and growing up I was lucky enough to experience the ""good side"" of the modern world, such as photography.

**But it wasn't the same for my family.** For them, professional photography was often a luxury they couldn't afford. As a result, they were left with hundreds of damaged photos, blurred childhood pictures, wedding pictures that were taken by family members instead of professional photographers - **and photo albums full of photos you could barely see**.

Decades of memories were barely visible - wedding photos where you couldn't see faces, childhood pictures that looked like watercolor smudges, family gatherings reduced to blurry shadows. However, some of the photos were *REALLY* good. **And all of them were worth saving.**

One of my absolute favorites is the photo below:

https://preview.redd.it/ci8v6rxukhhf1.png?width=3155&format=png&auto=webp&s=869a86557a161dce12ca3f8668a99e7dcdee1e81

Out of the good family photos, many of them were simply low-resolution and too small for today's screens. Many of these photos were so small, faded and/or damaged that you could barely see the faces. **So I decided to build something.**

I went through *THOUSANDS* of family photos - not artificially corrupted images, but real photos with real damage from real families. Water stains, tears, fading, scratches. - and **selected 150+ photos that I wanted to restore, bring back to life, and show to my grandmother**. I've also asked friends and family members to send me their old photos, and began experimenting.

**This is how it all started.**



# The endless search for the perfect AI photo restoration model

I began digging into existing AI models and tools, then learned about ML, vibe-coding, SaaS, startups and other topics that were unfamiliar to me until an year ago.

Started learning about training datasets. Turns out existing AI models learn from perfect photos - not 1960s Italian family snapshots with coffee stains and tears that were poorly stored inside an old luggage.

Using a model that was trained and fine-tuned on all kinds of photos (ranging from historical images to dusty family portraits from the 90's), **I started seeing the first successful photo restorations**.

My hopes were up, but little did I know **this was just the beginning**.

**The results were not good enough.** The faces were not always being preserved, some details remained lost, AI artifacts often appeared ruining the photos. Occasionally, AI kept turning my uncle's mustache into a shadow and gave my 5-year-old uncle the face of a 40-year-old. 🥸

It sounds funny now, but back then... it wasn't.

So I kept on fine-tuning, testing and fine-tuning. After a month, **the results of the photo restorations were similar and comparable to publicly available tools** such as ChatGPT\*, and better than existing models for photo restoration such as GFPGAN, Ddcolor and Codeformer.

*\*For those who don't know: you can upload a photo on ChatGPT and ask it to restore the image, preserving details and such. But the result won't ever be the same as the one provided by a model that was specifically trained on restoring photos.*

**But still, it wasn't good enough.** The photo restoration needed to be better. It needed to be something I could proudly show to my family, and perhaps the world. And so it became better. In fact, it became so good that I considered selling it as a service on communities like r/estoration \- but then I had a better idea.

Pinin - a dead-simple but extremely advanced AI restoration and enhancement tool that can be used by everyone - even your grandma. Not made for profit - **made to allow people to bring their memories, their families and their history back.**



# Turning the idea into reality

I took a break from all AI models, the endless research and all the fine-tuning when I've joined the Lovable Shipped competition. Amongst the prizes for the competition, there were **$100k in cash and a live pitch in front of investors plus a flight to San Francisco.** It was an opportunity I couldn't miss.

The competition was the perfect reason to stop waiting for the right moment, and to just do. With my unhealthy perfectionism set aside, I began working on Pinin. **The goal was to turn this personal project into something that could actually change other people's lives.**

**For the following 6 weeks, I've worked non-stop on the branding and the website** (both front-end and back-end) all by myself, with no team, no AI specialists and no developers. Every week, I've worked on the assignment on top of the assignments of my roadmap, documented the progress and submitted an update containing all the news, along with all the proofs. **Every week for six weeks.**

**There were all the bells and whistles**: legal pages, referral program, GDPR-compliance, magic link auth system for reduced friction and lots of under-the-hood optimizations. I've recorded and edited the final video pitch for investors, submitted it and crossed my fingers. **Pinin was ready. I was ready.**

# The product validation (from my grandmother)

**Once the tool was ready, showing it to my family was the biggest satisfaction.** We literally took a picture of an old family photo with a phone. Within 20 seconds, it was as if the photo was taken yesterday.

Then, I pulled out the 150+ restored photos that were collected months earlier.

**When I showed my grandmother the restored photos, she went silent.** Then she started crying. She pointed at her mother in a 50's family portrait and said, ""*She's beautiful. I forgot she was so beautiful.*""

This was the moment that made it all worth it. Building something that makes people happy.

**📌 Long story short:** I didn't win the competition. I didn't even make it to the top 50. I didn't get any prize and I didn't get to pitch the project to investors. **But I did finish the website**, it was now fully working and presentable. And most importantly, my grandma loved it.

**Pinin was born. And it did everything it promised.**

This technical challenge turned into something unexpectedly emotional. Turns out family memories hit different when you can actually see them clearly.

It's *very* important to note that damaged photos aren't just ""low quality"" images - they're archaeological records. Each type of damage tells a story about where the photo has been and what happened to it. Old cameras had specific optical characteristics - particular types of blur, depth of field patterns, grain structures.

The purpose of Pinin is not to replace old family photos with AI-generated pictures. **Pinin brings photos back to life. With all their quirks and all their history - with a better quality, clarity and resolution.**



# What is Pinin? And what does it do?

Pinin is a state-of-the-art image restoration tool that leverages the latest AI models and technologies to **bring photos back to life**.

It can colorize, deblur, remove dust & scratches, upscale and much more.

https://preview.redd.it/g34pxc5zkhhf1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8380e6307aeb96c6deb39bf6b96299010e876947

Pinin is not only for old and/or damaged photos. If you or someone in your family have blurry photos, or even photos taken with bad lightning, they can be corrected, restored and improved using Pinin.

**Remember the photo you've seen earlier?** Below you can see it corrected, restored and colorized by Pinin.

https://preview.redd.it/sd9zhvbelhhf1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf4d23f1bd8335beaf88bccfb25fdc601856f896

**Pinin is extremely easy to use.** With the magic link login, you only need an email address to try out Pinin. Drag and drop your photos, click the button and watch the magic happen. **It’s that simple.**

The goal here was to reduce friction, allowing everyone to quickly and accurately restore their photos without paying for manual restoration services that can cost hundreds of dollars.

Free users can upload up to 20 photos at the same time, and paid users can upload up to 100 photos simultaneously while taking advantage of bulk processing, improved quality and processing times.

# Why Pinin?

The name '*Pinin*' was inspired by [Giuseppina “Pinin” Brambilla Barcilon](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinin_Brambilla_Barcilon), a famous art restorer known for spending over 20 years restoring the Last Supper of Leonardo Da Vinci.

https://preview.redd.it/ernur560lhhf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac636ab1c3d7e448a56a5acdbe91a9a749d39f82

[Pinin.ai](https://pinin.ai/photo-restoration) aims to carry forward Giuseppina’s values by meticulously analyzing damage and **faithfully restoring photos in a way that existing tools can’t**.

Although Pinin may not have the same patience (photos are typically processed in *12 seconds on average*) or eye for detail that Giuseppina had, it also doesn’t come with the costs normally involved with manual photo restoration.

Nowadays, there are advanced tools and software that allow photo editors to accurately restore photos, but they require a lot of manual work - *which usually comes with a bill*.

[**🔗 Learn more about Pinin’s story**](https://pinin.ai/story-of-pinin)



# Unmatched quality & faithful photo restoration for everyone

**The accuracy of Pinin surpasses industry leaders like ChatGPT**, and even models that were specifically trained on restoring photos such as Codeformer, ddcolor or GFPGAN.

https://preview.redd.it/gu6utf52lhhf1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c3a48f7f95da8485c4e365879c326a9df69780a

While other models either do not restore the damage and/or create unwanted artifacts, AI faces and other issues that arise with the use of AI for standard photo generation, **Pinin focuses on maintaining the original details and face features.**

Most AI models were trained on pristine images, so when they see damage, they hallucinate details instead of intelligently reconstructing them.

**Below you can find a full-resolution comparison of Pinin with other AI tools:**

With the right prompting, ChatGPT can do wonders. But it’s not ready for image restoration. It was not *trained* for image restoration. The models used by Pinin were trained on hundreds of photos from all around the world. **This allows Pinin to carefully and faithfully restore lost details, faces, words, and even animals**.

[**🔗 See what Pinin can do (and how it compares to other tools)**](https://pinin.ai/examples)



# Does it really work?

**In most cases, it** ***really*** **does.**

The [examples ](https://pinin.ai/examples)page contains multiple real examples of photos that were restored using Pinin.ai. It showcases the use cases of the tool, that go from restoring damaged photos taken in the 60’s, to de-blurring modern photos, improving the look and resolution of small photos, colorizing, restoring the original colors after fading & much more.

https://preview.redd.it/hgbjl423lhhf1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7e97387640c4cc4a7746f27425ae0944b06e5b7

Preserving the original face features and details during the photo restoration process is the hardest part, especially when the details are not visible in the original photos. That’s where Pinin can make mistakes. In some cases, faces may look slightly different than the originals.

And that’s where our [refund policy](https://pinin.ai/refund-policy) kicks in - **Pinin is going to refund your credits if you are not happy with the final result.**



# So... what's the pricing?

Professional restoration quotes? $30-200 per photo. **Imagine that for 200+ damaged photos.**

AI models used for image generation, editing and restoration are not free either. They rely on high-performance GPUs to run smoothly and quickly. But using AI is still *considerably* cheaper than hiring someone that spends hours working on Photoshop, Lightroom and other software to restore photos.

**Pinin offers a double pricing model:** [**subscription and pay-per-photo**](https://pinin.ai/pricing)**.** You can either buy restoration credits for $1USD per credit (1 credit = 1 photo restoration), or **get a subscription and save up to 50% on your photo restorations**.



||Free plan|Giotto plan|Botticelli plan|Da Vinci plan|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price|$0|$9.99/m|$29.99/m|$49.99/m|
|Photos per month|Pay-per-photo|20 photos|50 photos|100 photos|
|Bulk upload limit|20 images|35 images|50 images|100 images|
|Batch processing speed|Slow batch processing|Basic batch processing|Fast batch processing|Extra-fast batch processing|
|Full commercial license|❌|✔️|✔️|✔️|

**Don't need a subscription plan?**

**No problem.** You can purchase photo restoration credits individually for as low as $0.70 per credit. No minimum purchase, and no lock-ins. **Safe and instant payments with Stripe.**

Even if you decide not to save and buy a subscription, you can still purchase one single credit and restore one photo for less than a coffee.

For those with photos that are particularly difficult to restore and can not be restored by AI, we also offer a [manual restoration service](https://pinin.ai/manual-restoration) starting from only $20 per photo.



# Don’t wait. Try [Pinin.ai](http://Pinin.ai) and restore your history today.

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Desperation**  
Let’s cut to the chase: *Monterrey is the favorite, and Charlotte FC is the underdog with the heart of a caffeinated squirrel*. The odds tell a story of a lopsided battle. Across all bookmakers, Monterrey’s implied probability of winning ranges from **54% to 58%** (thanks to decimal odds of 1.77–1.95), while Charlotte hovers around **25–27%**, with the draw splitting the difference. To put this in perspective, Charlotte’s chances of winning are roughly equivalent to me correctly guessing that you poured coffee, not creamer, into your mug this morning.

The spread doesn’t make it any easier for Charlotte: Monterrey is favored by -0.5 goals, meaning they must *win outright* to satisfy bettors. For Charlotte, it’s a +0.5 line—a mathematical way of saying “we’ll give you a head start, but only because we pity your optimism.” The total goals line sits at **2.75–3.0**, suggesting a low-scoring affair. In other words, expect a game where both teams play like they’re on a “no goals, just vibes” contract.

**Digest the News: Eliminated, But Not Emancipated**  
Both teams have been mathematically eliminated from the Leagues Cup, rendering this match as impactful as a screensaver during a power outage. Monterrey, with just two points, joined the “already out” club after a 1-0 loss to Columbus Crew, while Charlotte’s fate was sealed by a similar lack of oomph. Yet here they are, facing off in a game that’s less about advancement and more about preserving pride—or perhaps just collecting paychecks.

Monterrey’s squad, led by the legendary *Sergio Ramos* (or is that a ghost from Real Madrid’s past?), has shown flashes of brilliance but also the consistency of a toddler’s nap sched

1mjkh02,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1mjkh02/ritalin_didnt_work_cautiously_trying_vyvanse/,"Ritalin didn’t work, cautiously trying Vyvanse (trauma, cPTSD, ADHD) feeling discouraged and hoping for support.","Hi all,

I’m in my 30s with a history of childhood trauma, cPTSD, anxiety, and what I (and those around me) strongly believe is ADHD. I was diagnosed as a kid but no one took it seriously, and I was briefly prescribed Ritalin before falling off treatment. I’m high functioning and achievement driven. But I feel I have to work so hard to keep up with things. I’ve really noticed it since moving out of retail and into a corporate high paced job where the role can feel chaotic and lack structure. I’ve also been struggling having to move to a big city for that role.  What I once thought was cPTSD I now realize is combined with ADHD. At this point, I don’t feel how I’m functioning is sustainable and I’m at a breaking point. 

Over the years I’ve tried several antidepressants with not a lot of luck. 

- Zoloft and Lexapro made me sleep constantly and killed my motivation

- Prozac made everything feel uncomfortably bright and like I was floating

- Wellbutrin triggered intrusive thoughts and had to be stopped immediately

They helped a lot with my anxiety but completely wiped me out. I was exhausted all the time. Constantly sleeping. Falling asleep at work. And waking up not feeling fully rested. They also really dampened my drive and ambition and left me feeling foggy. I could literally feel the fog lift off of me when I quit them. 

In 2024, I worked with an NP who agreed I likely had ADHD and gave me a formal questionnaire to complete an assessment. We tried a two stimulants. 

- Ritalin LA 10 mg: felt like 4 cups of coffee, too high strung and felt I couldn’t leave the house and interact with people. Went to the grocery store and felt physical panic in my chest so quit after a few days. 

- Ritalin IR 5 mg: this felt more tolerable than the other one but I still felt too wired and the crash was terrible around 2pm

Then I moved and lost access to that provider. I’ve been unmedicated since then except for Ativan which I would use as needed for sleep.

Im once again feeling like I’m at a breaking point and a few months ago, I got on a waitlist for neuropsych testing (ADHD and autism). I’m 4 months into waiting and my mental health has just gotten worse. I feel worn down by everything and so sad and so anxious.  I feel overwhelmed all the time. I get overstimulated by noise and chaos or too many things at once and I’ve been operating like this for all of my life. My emotions are big and can feel like a hurricane going on inside of me. It’s hard for me to regulate. I am constantly stressed. Panic hits me when I’m trying to fall asleep and I have these weird panic attacks in between stages of sleep. And I cling to my routine because it feels if I don’t then I lose control over it all. I’ve dealt with all of these symptoms for most of my life, but I think what I do to function is wearing down on me. The only momentary relief I feel is when I’m running or powerlifting, hobbies I’ve had for several years.

My therapist felt I needed to see someone for medicated help while I wait for my neuropsychological testing so I met with a PA at an ADHD clinic today, who agreed I likely have combined-type ADHD after talking to me for an hour. She suggested continuing to stay on my testing waitlist to explore autism due to my stimming and sensory stuff. She was hesitant about trying more stimulants, saying I might be too sensitive given how I reacted to Ritalin. That was discouraging but I advocated for a Vyvanse trial and she agreed. I really do feel my ADHD needs to be treated. 

She prescribed 10 mg and asked me to dissolve it in 8 oz of water and start by drinking just 2 oz (2.5 mg). If I do well for a few days and said I could try half the dose.

I’m really worried about the possibility of  meds just not working for me. The PA kept saying it seemed I was sensitive medication. What if I always feel this overwhelmed? I’m exhausted from how hard it is to just function even though on the outside, people think I’ve really got my shit together. Logically everything is okay but I feel really unwell mentally. Super frustrating. There’s literally nothing to actually feel this upset about. 

I guess I’m posting for encouragement and thoughts. 

- Has anyone with trauma or cPTSD found relief from ADHD treatment?

- Has anyone done poorly on Ritalin but done better on Vyvanse? I know this really varies from person to person.

- Has anyone experienced issues with SSRIs like I have?

- Has micro dosing an ADHD med like my PA is suggesting helped anyone tolerate meds more comfortably?

Navigating all of this is so difficult and I just really hope I find some relief. Feeling fairly discouraged right now and would love some positive encouragement. I just don’t want to function like this or feel like this for the rest of my life.

So anyways as i said at the start my brother and leah were planning for their wedding, when one day josh just comes home seeming really panicked, and in his panic he slipped and fell into a coffee table (which had like glass on the top of it) so when he fell on it, it shattered and it got in joe's eye. So oviously even though leah and my brother don't know him very well they took him to the hospital. Luckily it wasn't too bad and the doctors took the glass out and put like one of those cotton pads on it and my brother and leah had to learn how to like change it and put meds on it. So when they get home they help joe and stuff. But one day, when my brother wakes up, leah and joe are just gone, he texts them, calls them, but nothing. i mean he waited days upon days for answers or calls or anything, but nothing.

# Why IPTV? (And Why You’re Probably Fed Up)

Traditional cable? Yawn. **IPTV** (Internet Protocol Television) streams live TV over the internet. Think: 50,000+ channels, global sports, PPV events, and movie libraries bigger than Netflix.

So, what makes the **best IPTV service**? I judged ’em on:

* **Channel variety** (sports, news, international)
* **VOD library** (movies, shows, on-demand)
* **Price-to-value ratio** (no hidden fees!)

They were under investigation in several states for their deceptive practices, and they were in the process of selling out to somebody. Which meant they were going to lay a bunch of us off. 

In the office they had a lot of free everything, basically we had our own DIY Starbucks. But I don't drink coffee. So I drank free Perrier. A lot of it. Probably 8-10 bottles per day. 

I'd also take more than I knew I'd drink and put them in my work bag. So my fridge at home was stocked with dozens of bottles at any given time. Nobody ever said anything, since our supervisor was remote and nobody was watching us. Eventually I knew I would get laid off, so I started taking even more. When it was my last day, I had to turn in my badge, I think I had already made 3 or 4 trips to my car and taken out more than 50 bottles of Perrier just that day alone.

We all know the music was incredible, the sit ins, the jams, Bobby’s emotional moments etc.

What were some of your favorite things from the weekend that didn’t have anything to do with how good the music was? 

One highlight for me was that my friend and I decided not to do Ubers/lyfts/busses/shuttles and instead rented Lyft E-bikes the whole weekend to get to the shows, and then to the after parties on pier 48. It was such an awesome way to see the city. Being able to make detours and check out the beautiful architecture. Hearing a jazz band playing from a coffee shop and being able to pull off and grab a coffee with some killing Jazz in the background. 

Another was that my buddy and I took a 21 year old kid under our wing for the weekend who flew out to the shows from NY by himself! I think we showed him a really good time, brought him to the after parties with us, and just had a great time with him. He was a good kid and a true head who knew all the lyrics. 

Seeing so many deadheads in the city, knowing we were all there for the same thing and all over the moon with happiness to be celebrating 60 years of the dead. 

Biking out to Golden Gate Bridge, stopping by the fine arts palace, appreciating all the architecture and beautiful biodiversity of the city was up there as well.

1mjk8mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitches_in_Reality/comments/1mjk8mi/my_fortune_cookie_was_right/,My fortune cookie was right,"My Fortune Cookie Was Right

The slip of paper is still here, tucked inside my old wallet. The red ink has faded, but still readable. I take it out sometimes, when the silence gets too loud. I don’t need to read the words. They are branded onto the back of my eyelids.


It happened the night before our trip to Blackwood Peak. Megan was giddy with excitement, her blonde hair pulled into a messy bun as she double-checked our supplies. 


“Energy bars, check. Extra socks, check. Bear spray… you have the bear spray, right, Zach”?


“Right here,” I said, holding up the canister. My voice wasn’t like this then. It had texture. It could laugh.


As I cinched the straps on my old backpack, something small and plastic-wrapped fell out and skittered across the hardwood floor. A fortune cookie from a takeout dinner weeks ago.


Megan pounced on it. “Ooh, a prophecy!” She sounded like a little kid when she said it. She always spoke with a girlish charm. She cracked it open and handed me the little strip of paper. I read it aloud.


“The summit is in sight, but the path is steepest and most treacherous here.”


I remember a small, cold knot forming in my gut, like a flicker of dread. Megan just laughed it off. “Well, duh,” she said, nudging my shoulder. “That’s how mountains work. The best view comes after the hardest climb.” She tucked the little paper into the pocket of my jacket. “For good luck,” she told me.


The next morning was perfect. The sun was shining, and the air had that crisp, clean scent of pine and damp earth. The first few miles of the trail were pretty easy. Mostly just a winding path through the trees with a little uphill trend. 


We talked about everything and nothing—her terrible boss, the movie we saw last week, the ridiculous idea of opening a coffee shop that only served coffee to dogs. Her laughter was the only sound that mattered, I loved spending time with her.


Around midday, the trail began to change. The gentle slope gave way to a series of grueling switchbacks carved into the mountainside. The lush forest thinned, replaced by scrub brush and fields of loose rock, or scree. The world fell away to our left in a dizzying, thousand-foot drop.


I complained that it was getting steep. And that I was going to buy a different brand of hiking poles as soon as we got back.


“Told you,” Megan grinned back at me, her cheeks flushed with exertion. “The best view is coming.”


The weather turned with an unnatural speed. One minute, the sun was warm on our necks; the next, a cold, gray mist began swallowing the landscape.

 

Megan was like, “Where are all these clouds coming from all the sudden?”


Of course, we should have turned back. Any sane person would have turned back. But we could see it—the rocky crown of the summit, maybe only another half a mile above us, appearing and disappearing as the clouds swirled. It was so close. The summit was in sight. We decided to go for it.


We were scrambling over slick boulders on a ledge that couldn’t have been more than two feet wide. The drop beside us was a formless, gray void.


 We moved slowly, deliberately, not speaking anymore. The only sounds were the scrape of our boots, our heavy breathing, and the whistling of the wind.


It happened just ahead of me. She had just pulled herself up onto a flat, table-like rock that marked the final, most dangerous traverse. She turned and padded the spot next to her then asked me if I wanted to take a break.


I sat down next to her and we adjusted ourselves. Carefully. She took out her cell phone and began to set up her selfie stick.


She held the phone out in front of us and I felt her trying to adjust her body as we both slid back a little. That's all it took. 


She dropped the selfie stick at the same time that I heard a little sound from her like, “Oh! And then her legs flew back before I could even react. I lunged, my fingers stretching into nothingness.


I screamed out her name.


And the wind came screaming back. I was left alone on the ledge, staring at the empty space where she had been.


Megan had fallen some 480ft to her death. They called it a tragic accident. A sudden gust of wind, a slippery rock. They were very kind. But I knew that it was all my fault. I ignored the warning.


I’ve never gone back to the mountains. My world is flat now, and monotone. Every day, I live on that ledge, in that moment. I see her smile falter on her cell phone cam. I see the summit in plain sight, but the path was steepest and most treacherous there. 


My fortune cookie was right. It wasn’t a warning. It was a destination.


I still can’t reconcile it in my mind. Was it a cruel joke of fate that my fortune cookie would turn out to be so accurate? Or was it a coincidence that is still playing simple tricks on my mind to this day? 


What do you think? Has anything like this ever happened to you? I hope not. I hoped that by sharing my story it would offer me some measure of solace. 


But I sincerely hope you never have to go through what I went through to even come near to sharing a story like this.


And finally, just as an unsolicited word of advice;

But we’ve never had the luxury. Ever. 

Our kid (3, turning 4 in a few weeks) has always been wide awake, refusing to sleep or stay in her room, until 10PM and sometimes later. They wake up anywhere between 6-6:30 and 8. 

They still nap at preschool. So we keep the schedule for the most part on days off. But even when we skip the nap, it’s like the kid drank a pot of coffee in the evening. It doesn’t matter how much we try to wear the kid out throughout the day. 

Doctors give us the usual spiel and even cleared us to use melatonin for a few consecutive days to establish a routine, which sorta works — the kid goes to bed quicker and easier but only 30 minutes earlier than usual. The late nights pick back up after the melatonin stops. 

I doubt there’s anything we can do but wait it out until we have a teenager who locks themselves in their room until dinner and again until bedtime. But that’s a decade from now and we’re T-I-R-E-D, y’all. 

So I guess I’m only sharing this in hopes of gaining solidarity with parents who are currently or who have already been through this.

**Material:** It is important to examine the materials used when making a mushroom drip mug.

The material of a mushroom drip mug is critical to its durability, heat retention, and aesthetic appeal. The most common materials include ceramic, stoneware, and porcelain. ceramic mugs are generally affordable and come in a wide range of colors and designs. Stoneware offers greater durability and a rustic feel.Porcelain, known for its smooth texture and elegant appearance, is often reserved for more upscale mushroom drip mugs. Check that the material is food safe and free of harmful chemicals,such as lead and cadmium,especially if you plan to use the mug for hot beverages regularly.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The Design can vary widely.

The design of a mushroom drip mug is what sets it apart from ordinary mugs. Key elements to consider include the overall shape, the realism and detail of the mushroom features, and the color palette.Some mugs feature a single prominent mushroom, while others incorporate clusters of various fungi. The hand-painted or glazed details should be carefully examined for precision and artistry.Consider whether you prefer a more realistic depiction of mushrooms or a stylized, whimsical interpretation.The handle design and its ergonomic comfort are also essential factors to ensure a pleasant drinking experience.

**Size and Capacity:** Mug size is very critically important to consider.

The size and capacity of a mushroom drip mug influence its practicality for different uses. Smaller mugs, typically holding 8-12 ounces, are ideal for espresso, tea, or small servings of coffee. Larger mugs, with a capacity of 14-20 ounces or more, are better suited for larger coffee servings, lattes, or soups.Consider your typical beverage consumption and choose a mug size that aligns with your needs. Also, bear in mind that larger mugs may become heavy when filled and less comfortable to hold for extended periods.

**Glaze and Finish:** Glaze is important!

The glaze and finish of a mushroom drip mug significantly impact its appearance, durability, and ease of cleaning. A high-quality glaze provides a smooth, non-porous surface that is resistant to staining and chipping. Different glaze types, such as glossy, matte, and reactive glazes, offer unique aesthetic effects. Reactive glazes, in particular, can create beautiful, unpredictable color variations that enhance the mug's artistic appeal. Ensure the glaze is food-safe and free of lead and cadmium.

They’re too tired to play hard but too restless to chill, and you’re just trying to make it to dinner without giving in to more screen time. When my son was around two or three, we found a few easy go-to activities that helped us survive that weird late-afternoon stretch. Nothing fancy, just simple stuff that actually kept him busy and gave me a breather.


1. Water Painting

All you need is a cup of water and a brush. He’d “paint” on the patio, the fence, cardboard boxes, whatever we had around. Sometimes I’d draw shapes or letters for him to trace. It was zero mess, zero cleanup, and somehow kept him locked in longer than most toys.

2. Sticker Story Time

We used those dollar store sticker books and some blank paper. I’d tell him to make a story using the stickers, and he’d go wild creating little adventures. I just sat with him asking questions about the characters while sipping coffee. It made him feel like we were doing something fun together without needing much from me.

3. Magnetic Wall Play

We’ve got one of those magnetic wall decals from Tix & Mix set up in his room and it’s honestly been one of the few things he keeps coming back to. He moves the magnets around, draws with crayons, and makes up little games. The crayons they came with wipe off super easy too, which is a huge win if you’ve ever dealt with regular ones that leave stains all over the wall. And when he starts to lose interest, we just switch out the magnets or clean it off and it feels new again.

These aren’t magic fixes, but they’ve helped us get through that late afternoon chaos without turning on a show every time. If you’re in the same boat, might be worth trying a couple of these. Always down to hear other low-effort wins if anyone’s got some.",22,1754522344.0,Parenting,6,0.9,False

I have just received my THIRD machine from ninja as the other 2 were faulty. The third machine is also faulty, it is not delivering the correct volume of espresso and the ninja tech guy agreed. He said he’ll arrange for another replacement, which would make it my FOURTH machine.

Whilst I do like the ninja cafe lux, it isn’t really working out for me, be it bad luck or whatever. I study videos, YouTube, coffee blogs and read the  instructions throughly to rule out user error, and always use locally roasted fresh beans, to which the ninja tech guy said is there isn’t a user error on my part.


My question is, is it unreasonable for me to say no thanks to a 3rd replacement and a fourth machine, and just ask for a refund and get a sage/breville barista?

The world of software development just got a major upgrade. Google's AI coding agent Jules is now out of beta, marking a pivotal moment for developers worldwide who have been waiting to get their hands on this autonomous coding companion.

Originally unveiled in December 2024, Jules transitioned into public beta in May 2025. The tool is now accessible in regions where Gemini 2.5 Pro is supported. What makes this launch particularly exciting is how Jules changes the fundamental approach to coding assistance.

# What Makes Jules Different from Other Coding Tools

Most coding assistants require you to babysit them. You ask a question, wait for a response, then implement the suggestion manually. Jules flips this entire concept on its head.

Jules is an asynchronous agent that gets out of your way. It lets you focus on the coding you want to do, meanwhile picking up all the other random tasks that you rather not do.

Think of Jules as that reliable team member who handles all the tedious stuff while you tackle the creative problem-solving. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro, Jules is an asynchronous, agent-based coding tool that integrates with GitHub, clones codebases into Google Cloud virtual machines, and uses AI to fix or update code while developers focus on other tasks.

The beauty lies in its hands-off approach. You can assign Jules a task, walk away to grab coffee or work on something else, and return to find the work completed. No constant supervision required.

# How the Asynchronous Magic Works

Traditional coding assistants operate in real-time, demanding your immediate attention. Jules operates differently. Jules operates asynchronously, which means it can work on your projects independently while you focus on other priorities.

Here's how the process typically unfolds:

1. You connect Jules to your GitHub repository
2. Jules creates a secure workspace in Google Cloud
3. You assign specific tasks or problems to solve
4. Jules analyzes your entire codebase for context
5. The agent works independently on the assigned tasks
6. You receive updates and can review completed work

This workflow transforms how development teams operate, especially when dealing with large codebases or multiple concurrent projects.

# Core Capabilities That Set Jules Apart

The agent is designed to help developers with repetitive tasks like fixing bugs, writing documentation, generating tests, and building features. But Jules goes beyond simple automation.

# Bug Fixing with Full Context Understanding

Jules doesn't just patch surface-level issues. It clones your codebase into a secure Google Cloud virtual machine (VM), understands the full context of your project before making any changes.

This comprehensive understanding means Jules can identify root causes rather than applying band-aid fixes. The agent analyzes dependencies, examines related functions, and considers the broader architecture before implementing solutions.

# Documentation That Actually Makes Sense

We've all encountered auto-generated documentation that feels robotic and unhelpful. Jules approaches documentation differently by understanding your code's actual purpose and writing explanations that developers can actually use.

The agent creates:

* Clear function and class descriptions
* Usage examples with practical scenarios
* API documentation with real-world context
* Code comments that explain the 'why' not just the 'what'

# Test Generation Beyond Basic Coverage

Test writing often feels like a chore, leading to poor coverage or superficial tests. Jules generates comprehensive test suites that actually catch edge cases and potential failures.

The agent examines your code paths, identifies potential failure points, and creates tests that provide meaningful coverage. This goes far beyond simple unit tests to include integration scenarios and edge case handling.

# Feature Development from Concept to Code

Perhaps most impressively, Jules can take feature requirements and translate them into working code. The agent breaks down complex features into manageable components and implements them systematically.

This capability proves particularly valuable for:

* Prototyping new functionality quickly
* Implementing standard patterns across codebases
* Building boilerplate code for new modules
* Creating consistent interfaces between components

# The Technical Foundation Behind Jules

Jules runs asynchronously and uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which is optimized for coding. This foundation provides several technical advantages that make Jules more capable than previous coding assistants.

# Gemini 2.5 Pro's Coding Optimization

The underlying model has been specifically tuned for software development tasks. This optimization shows in Jules' ability to:

* Understand complex codebases with thousands of files
* Maintain context across multiple programming languages
* Generate code that follows established patterns and conventions
* Identify potential security vulnerabilities and performance issues

# Secure Cloud Environment

Jules clones your codebase into a secure Google Cloud virtual machine (VM), creating an isolated environment for code analysis and modification.

This approach offers several benefits:

* Your original codebase remains untouched until you approve changes
* Jules can safely experiment with modifications
* The agent has access to a full development environment
* All work happens in Google's secure infrastructure

# GitHub Integration That Actually Works

Many tools claim GitHub integration but fall short in practice. Jules provides deep integration that feels natural to existing workflows.

The agent can:

* Automatically create pull requests with detailed descriptions
* Respond to code review comments with improvements
* Handle merge conflicts intelligently
* Track issues and link code changes to specific problems

# Getting Started: From Signup to First Task

After signing up at [jules.google.com](http://jules.google.com) and linking your GitHub account, the setup process takes minutes rather than hours.

# Account Setup Process

The onboarding experience prioritizes simplicity:

1. Visit [jules.google.com](http://jules.google.com) and create your account
2. Connect your GitHub account with appropriate permissions
3. Select repositories you want Jules to access
4. Configure notification preferences for task updates
5. Set up your first project workspace

# Your First Jules Assignment

Start with something manageable to get familiar with the workflow. Pick a repository with existing issues or technical debt that needs attention.

Good first tasks include:

* Adding missing unit tests to a specific module
* Updating outdated documentation
* Fixing a non-critical bug with clear reproduction steps
* Refactoring a messy function with well-defined behavior

# Understanding Jules' Communication Style

Jules communicates through GitHub comments, pull requests, and optional email notifications. The agent provides detailed explanations of changes, reasoning behind decisions, and suggestions for further improvements.

Learning to interpret and respond to Jules' communications helps you get maximum value from the collaboration.

# Real-World Impact: How Development Teams Are Using Jules

As our new age of agentic AI takes shape, Google is stepping up its game with the introduction of the Jules agent and enhanced Gemini AI, responding to growing competition in the developer tools space.

# Startup Teams Moving Faster

Small development teams often struggle with technical debt because they focus on building new features. Jules handles the maintenance tasks that usually get pushed to ""later.""

One startup reported that Jules allowed their three-person development team to maintain code quality standards typically associated with much larger teams. The agent handled documentation updates, test coverage improvements, and routine bug fixes while developers focused on product development.

# Enterprise Teams Scaling Code Quality

Large organizations face different challenges around code consistency and standards compliance. Jules helps by:

* Applying coding standards consistently across teams
* Identifying potential security issues before they reach production
* Maintaining documentation as codebases evolve
* Helping onboard new developers with better code comments

# Open Source Maintainers Getting Relief

Open source maintainers often burn out from handling numerous small issues and pull requests. Jules can help by:

* Triaging and fixing simple bugs
* Improving documentation based on common user questions
* Adding tests for uncovered code paths
* Cleaning up code style inconsistencies

# Current Limitations and What's Coming Next

During the public beta phase, Jules is available free of charge, though use is limited to five requests per day. This limitation reflects the current computational requirements while Google scales the service.

# Language and Framework Support

According to Google, Jules can ... whether Google is working on extending it to additional languages. Currently, Jules works best with popular programming languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Go.

Support for specialized languages and frameworks continues expanding, but some niche technologies may not receive full support initially.

# Complex Architecture Understanding

While Jules excels at understanding individual projects, complex microservice architectures or distributed systems can challenge the agent's contextual understanding.

The agent performs best when:

* Working with well-structured codebases
* Dealing with clearly defined interfaces between components
* Operating on projects with good existing documentation
* Handling conventional architecture patterns

# Custom Business Logic

Jules sometimes struggles with highly domain-specific business logic that requires deep industry knowledge. The agent works best on technical tasks rather than business rule implementation.

# Pricing and Availability Details

The tool is now accessible in regions where Gemini 2.5 Pro is supported. This geographic limitation reflects Google's infrastructure rollout strategy.

Postmark, Sonoma County, Chardonnay, 2021, 14.2% abv.

From the Duckhorn portfolio, looks like from the more discounted side.

Nose: western pears! Not as strong as bosc pears but stronger than anjou pears, some support from floral green grapes, bit of soda.

Palate: light to medium body, carbonated anjou pears, old bosc pears almost candied but of lighter intensity, hint of hazelnuts, overall sweet and juicy, but nothing spectacular or interesting.

Finish: short, bread, background of anjou pears, acacia honey, sweet mouthfeel.

Vernacular: aromas of effervescent pears and a bit floral. Medium body of moderate acidity, minimal secondary and minerality, no alcohol. Short finish. One of the few times those systematic, textbook descriptors not being far from reality.

I heard this is the typical chardonnay profile from a hot year... I wouldn't say this is tropical or citrus oriented, nor are the components strong or buoyant as other online tasters have posted. Their wordsmiths from the marketing department are pretty capable. A few large steps away from greatness. Costs around KRW₩33K, or about USD$24, in Busan South Korea.

Grade: C+



Baron Philippe de Rothschild, Escudo Rojo, Syrah, 2021, 14.5% abv.

From 20 year old vines on the terraces of the Maipo River.

Nose: bread with many malty notes, then the darker berries come out, but they do not dominate the bready notes. Aromas appear quite heavy overall. Damn.

Palate: medium body, slightly viscous, bitter and somewhat tannic, blackberries, black currants, diluted coffee, dried blueberries, black olives sans the sourness, wood, a sweet older leather with flashes of dryness popping out from sip to sip.

Finish: short and dry, tannic, leather. Ew.

Vernacular: nose of malted products and darker berries leading to a medium bodied collection of green tannins, low acidity, some tertiary. The finish is short, dry, and tannic. 

Not a tannin monster, but is inching closer to it. Not much in terms of flavors, but much in terms of tannic mouthfeel. I wonder what the ageing potential of this is. James Sucking gave this 91 points in 2022, Jesica Vargas from Wine Enthusiast gave this 90 points in 2023. Sold for about KRW₩21K, or about USD$15, around Busan, South Korea.

1mjjtvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mjjtvk/anxiety_after_starting_cpap/,Anxiety after starting CPAP?,"I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea recently and got my machine last week. The doctor told me I would see improvement on my anxiety and procrastination, and other health areas.


The first few nights using the machine were okay, I was still getting used to it, would wake up here and there and such. But when I woke up in the morning I felt fresh and energized like never before. 


The past two nights I’ve been able to fall asleep quickly and sleep through the night, although both times I woke up at 3:00-4:00 ish am. And I woke up feeling fresh and with energy. But then, once I got into my job I started feeling anxious and then tired. Yesterday, I felt an insatiable hunger and ended up eating a lot of Chinese food for lunch and then feeling sleepy and bloated (it didn’t help i was carrying acid reflux from the day before so it also could’ve been that). When I got home I even got a weird dizzy spell for a few seconds and I had to sit for fear I might fall.


Today, anxiety was creeping in and I tried to ignore it. I ate a very healthy lunch (broccoli and boiled chicken) and felt super tired afterwards, to the point of not being able to get a lot of work done. I get sleepy if I eat a lot or if I eat high carb foods, but chicken and veggies are my go to meal for something that’s filling without bringing my energy down. When I got home I was very tired and had a headache comparable to when I had to cut coffee cold turkey. I had to lie down and take a nap. Now I woke up, and I’m feeling a little bit better but not by a long shot. 

I’m so confused and I can’t seem to find answers (having anxiety over medical stuff doesn’t help). I thought the more I slept with the machine the better I would feel but it feels like the opposite. I don’t want to go back to not using the machine, since I can feel the good it does to my body, it’s just this weird anxiety and exhaustion combo that doesn’t fit in any of this.

I’m not feeling the inner nose swimming pool feeling when I take too much coffee, and my vision feels different in a way that I’m really scared I double dosed. I drank a bunch of citric acid infused sparkling water and I almost immediately felt calmer but I still feel anxious and warped like there’s a chunk of my brain missing. I really really hope I didn’t double dose. I’m not young, and I hate to think the damage it’s doing to my brain if I did.

The bustling city of Bricksburg glittered under a neon sunset, its Lego skyline a mosaic of endless possibility. Emmet Brickowski, ever the cheerful construction worker, was hauling a stack of bricks to a new site when he spotted a familiar shadow brooding on a rooftop. Lego Batman, his cape snapping dramatically in the breeze, was glaring down at the city like it personally offended him.

“Hey, Batman!” Emmet called, waving enthusiastically. “Whatcha doing up there? Saving the city from rogue stud shooters?”

Batman’s scowl softened, just a fraction. “Emmet. I’m brooding. It’s what I do. Also, I’m tracking a rogue Kragle tube. But mostly brooding.”

Emmet grinned, undeterred, and scrambled up the fire escape to join him. “Mind if I brood with you? I’m awesome at it. Check this out.” He furrowed his brow comically, puffing out his chest. Batman snorted—a rare sound—and Emmet counted it as a win.

They sat side by side, legs dangling over the edge, the city humming below. Emmet rambled about his day—new blueprints, a coffee spill, Wyldstyle’s latest stunt—while Batman listened, his gruff demeanor softening. It had been like this lately: chance meetings, late-night talks. Emmet’s relentless optimism was a puzzle Batman couldn’t solve, and yet he kept coming back.

“Emmet,” Batman interrupted, his voice low, “why do you keep hanging around me? I’m... dark. You’re all... sunshine and instruction manuals.”

Emmet tilted his head, his plastic smile faltering. “I dunno. You’re cool, Batman. Like, *really* cool. And when I’m with you, I feel... I don’t know, different. Like I don’t have to be just the ‘everything is awesome’ guy.”

Batman’s eyes, hidden behind his cowl, widened slightly. The air between them shifted, heavy with something unspoken. Without thinking, Batman reached out, his gloved hand brushing Emmet’s. Emmet froze, his heart—a tiny Lego piece—thumping louder than a jackhammer. Then, slowly, he turned his hand over, interlocking their fingers like perfectly snapped bricks.

“Emmet, I don’t do... feelings,” Batman muttered, but he didn’t pull away. “I’m vengeance. I’m the night. I’m—”

“Awesome?” Emmet teased, leaning closer. Their faces were inches apart, and before Batman could growl another protest, Emmet closed the gap, pressing his lips to Batman’s. It was quick, clumsy, a little like two Lego pieces not quite fitting right at first. But then Batman kissed back, fierce and unguarded, and for a moment, the brooding hero was just a guy, lost in a spark he hadn’t seen coming.

They parted, breathless, the city’s glow reflecting off their plastic faces. “This doesn’t mean I’m joining your happy sing-alongs,” Batman grumbled, but his hand stayed in Emmet’s.

Emmet laughed, his grin brighter than ever. “Deal. But you’re totally coming to my next taco Tuesday.”

As the stars blinked on above Bricksburg, Emmet and Batman sat in silence, hands still linked, their secret safe among the bricks. Below, the city carried on, unaware of the spark that had just changed everything.",0,1754521655.0,lego,0,0.25,False

Sorry for the brain dump. First time posting. Tldr now added but bottom three paragraphs explain it best.

I wish to start by saying I am still livid. I am going to try and write this without being bias and also keep work/personal details vague.

This is in the UK.

I will specify the question of AITA later but please no comments about reproduction, gender roles or pregnancy if you just want to pop off.

also, I know I overuse the word apparently, but all this info in a short amount of time i still don't know what to think

Key people.

I – Me (30F, Engaged)

A – Pregnant Friend (33F, Married)

B – A’s Husband and friend (35M)

C – Friend (34, Married with kids, 8(Bonus), 6(Birthed), Stillborn 3 yrs ago (this is relevant I feel)

D – Friend (34, Engaged, CF)

I met all the above through work, all us “girls” were in the same enrolment almost 10 years ago, similar jobs and worked in the same smaller satellite office until C-19 when they closed it. I, B and D still work there. C changed companies and then stopped to raise the babes, went back part time last September. A is now a SAHW soon to be Mom. Although we are all very close, been in the wedding parties etc C and I are slightly closer as we live nearer, and A and D are closer. we also do have other friendships so we aren't in each others pockets all day, every day.

 Overall context

I originally met B first as he played football with the work team that my then boyfriend was also part of, he then changed roles at the company and became my direct contact at the central office, so we worked together on lots of stuff. We had a small social circle who would go out at weekends etc and that’s where A & B met, began talking and got together. D also met her husband at work pretty much the same way. When my relationship ended (horribly and why he is not a key person) B was incredibly supportive and I feel we have a really good friendship while me A, C and D are a real “Girl Gang”. Since lockdown we work hybrid but still meet up regularly to catch up and have an insane group chat. We have probably had 5 moderate “fall outs” in the 10 years, which given we were all in our 20s with big personalities, we joke is impressive! But looking back 3 of those 5 were actually A having an issue with someone/the group and then either stonewalling all of us or trying to split the group depending on the disagreement.

Specific context

A and B got married in 2022. B also was promoted (again) to a senior role within the company. In the December they ran a voluntary redundancy scheme within certain areas of the company including A’s, she took it as was already planning to resign in the new year so actually worked out well. Since then she has loved being a SATW, originally they weren’t that sure if they wanted children, it wasn’t really something we discussed to much as a group beyond knowing me and C wanted them, D didn’t and B didn’t know. The pregnancy was a surprise to our group when she told us at around 8 weeks, but we were all thrilled for her when she told us as it was clear she was happy too! The reason for telling us “early” was actually B was scheduled to be abroad for the first scheduled scan so she wanted us all to be aware and around, as she didn't want to move it but he actually managed to rearrange things to fly home and attend the scan. She is now 7 months and although she “brags” about the having the easiest pregnancy, she’s actually been very humble and acknowledges how much worse some people have symptoms, we can all tell she has found it somewhat difficult, more the social side of the pregnancy than symptoms. She hates that she can’t drink, I took her a little while to accept she needed to buy (maternity) clothes she considers ugly (although she has no budget and has bought some gorgeous outfits), that her diet is restricted and she misses the “occasional smoke at the end of a good night”.

We have all made adjustments for this, dinners out with a bottle of wine have turned into lunches and brunches at more café style locations rather than bars and restaurants. We often go round to each other’s houses for events but we have all consciously tried to take the focus off drinking. D's wedding has been a good focal point but we do make sure to ask after A and offer support and help as much as possible. The baby shower is in 2 weeks and we have all helped with planning and decorations. I am the only one in the group (and C’s Husband) who regularly smoke, I now bring along a vape to meet ups and try to only use that. There is other small things and A has always been grateful, for the most part she has been the same with all of us.

Final context now on B. He is genuinely so excited to be a father. The day after A told all of us he found me at work and was like a kid on Christmas eve being so happy he can now talk about it with us. Both sets of grandparents to be had been told but they were waiting in the main until 12 weeks so for a month B could only talk about it to myself and D. It was him that told us they had started to really discuss it the end of last year, partly as A was considering taking a part-time role at the place she volunteers but asked B what the point would be if they were going to start a family because she wouldn’t want to work during/for several years after each pregnancy. Apparently at this point B started doing research and changed his lifestyle/habits based on articles he’d read, he even visited his doctors for an all clear and around Christmas explained to A that he was willing and ready to try for a baby if she wanted to, and he explained/showed her is “health routine” that was supposed to improve his side and pledged to follow it for at least the year, but as she was on orally birth control the decision was hers, just to let him know. He also promised in the future if she decided she was ready he would get back on this plan to improve their chances of a good pregnancy. I don't know a lot about this but that seems like a lot of effort for him to put in. (A told us she apparently threw out her pills that day!) Things moved quick, and from the moment the pregnancy test came back positive B has been following all the same “restrictions” that A has to follow (with the exception of having real coffee at work not decaf!). I have never known a man so ready to be a father, and so supportive in a subtle way.

A regularly tells us how good he has been with her self-acknowledged “moments of madness” meaning mood swings, impulsive actions and more recently the cravings. It’s rare for her to complain about anything we would consider to be a big problem and she has always seemed to be cheerful and happy with B. B and I talk fairly often at work and again he has never given any indication they fight or disagree and he speaks with pride and care every time he talks about A and the baby. The only small foreshadowing I can think of to the current issue is about 2 weeks ago he asked me and D at lunch what we knew about “push presents” it was very vague and we thought he was trying to get hints of if and what to give her, although when we asked if we should find out he told us strongly, no (which does make me a small AH later in the story)

So, Finally, Current issue.

We “Girls” all had lunch yesterday, we were planning on mooching the shops in town after and actually going to D’s that evening. Everything was going quite well although A did seem a little edgy. Stating as we sat no one can order a cocktail, being short with the staff and seeming a little uninterested in the conversations. We all had mocktails, our meals were lovely, and we were just sat around chatting about D’s wedding plans and somehow, we were talking about gifts. A did seem interested in this conversation talking about the gifts she got us and the others in the wedding party and that she gave B a gift, she asked C if they did that and asked if she got a “push present”. C spoke about the wedding gifts (again we were all in the wedding party) but was a little vague. I decided to ask the question (and this does make me an AH as B said not too and now, I can see why) If she was expecting a push present? She threw her hands up, took this deep sigh and stared at all three of us like we were crazy and said emphatically “Yes, Obviously!”. We all kind of laughed and asked what she had in mind. I specifically asked if she wanted another ring as she loves rings and B has bought her one for almost every special occasion since they got married. Her facial expression didn’t change, and she waited for us all to stop talking (we were talking over each other and to each other in the moment, but it felt very light-hearted and turned awkward when we all sat there silent).

It was C that asked “do you know what you want?” and B just shrugged and said “a few things, but it better be worth £50,000”. Read that again because it’s still insane over 24 hours later. We were all floored. Usually we would laugh but it was clear she was genuinely serious and looking at us still like we should know or understand something. We asked why and she went into a rant which I will try to summarise only with the info from her as we got more later but according to her. Pregnancy has already “impacted” her life, her body was being ruined and would be permanently ruined after birth, she still wouldn’t get her body back as “it belongs to the baby” and she deserves compensation… from her husband!

She said some other things but we were all just in shock, eventually she began to calm and asked if she was so wrong. We, mainly D actually, tried to gently say that its just part of the journey and although a “push present” would be a lovely gesture she can’t really expect more than what she might get for valentines or their engagement anniversary (A&B gift on a lot of occasions, I find it slightly odd and both say gift giving isn’t their love languages but they do them and it works). She huffed but did seem to be calming down so we assumed the outburst was hormonal and began talking about other gifts she’d been given. (again context, the necklace she had on was her birthday gift from B and actually cost more than my engagement ring, it was not her only gift!). Probably a mistake but we got another round of mocktails and tried to lighten the mood and change the topic but she did get fired up again and starting saying she felt she deserved more and we should support her. This is where it really got ridiculous, D said something I can’t remember and A’s justification was “if I was a surrogate I’d be paid at least £50k” I began to heat up at this, and I could see the others did too. We began to rationalise that she is not a surrogate, she is the mother. At one point she said something like “so that means I don’t get anything for what I’ve been through” in this incredibly disdainful, annoyed tone and it was C who said, calmly (and can’t go into it too much but how she coped throughout all this is just incredible!) “You get to be a mother”. Everything now was heated and we were all repeating ourselves, I signalled for the check as we were making a scene and when A saw me do so she told us we were all letting her down and couldn’t see her point and she wanted to just go. We said that’s fair, I offered to cover her portion of the bill and she grabbed her stuff, D got up to hug her but A pulled back, D offered to walk with her to her car but she shook her head (I think because she was tearful more than to be rude) but when D said she’d see her later she did nod and said to the table “bye, love you” which is basically our normal goodbye while still being so awkward.

Once she left we debriefed, all of us agreed this was a crazy position for her to take and just talked it through, I was definitely the most angry regarding it but the others calmed me down and we did wonder if this was all hormones or even something deeper. We left, but D decided to go home rather than shop and invite A round early to try and talk to her one on one. As I mentioned I was actually annoyed by A’s mentality so I did do some quick internet searching both on Push Presents (people are wild with this!) and surrogacy because that was the part that really irritated me.

While I and C were shopping I got a message from D saying A was going to come round that evening but asked me and C not come. We were actually going round to help with wedding things so C offered to go collect the supplies and bring them to hers so we could still have our girl’s night crafting.

Several hours later while I was at C’s (with a real drink this time) D text me directly again just saying “A is en route, staying here tonight, maybe reach out to B” I did text him letting him know briefly what went down at lunch, where we were and if he wanted a talk he could, that none of us meant to upset her and that we are just worried. He responded “WTAF is this normal” and then if he could come over.

They had a huge row when he got home from work and she stormed out. Apparently he thought we all knew and supported her with her ask so when we clearly didn't she assumed he had said something at work to me and D and that's why we were against it.

His side of the whole thing is this all started when she was around 4 months pregnant and began showing, she mentioned a push present a few times casually but a few days after her birthday apparently she sat him down and said she expected push presents that would compensate her for everything she has gone through (apparently not having seafood or alcohol at her birthday dinner made her feel this was important to bring up). Apparently, their discussion was quite similar to ours but without the mention of surrogacy. She requested multiple gifts including money outright, designer handbags, upgrading her car, a luxury holiday both before and after birth and multiple treatments, products, days out. I don't think at the time she was asking for everything but certainly not just one. B said at the time this really scared him, she had cried throughout and shouted at him about everything she was going/would go through so he was worried this was a symptom of her having a hard time mentally with the pregnancy (remember all the research he did). He also looked up push presents afterwards and saw that some people do spend thousands so at that point he was more worried over her feelings towards the pregnancy than the cost anyway.

They did go to either the doctor or midwife and B did bring this up (A was fuming afterwards but didn't tell us). They had discussions with them together and both separately and felt there was no real concern regarding her and the baby/pregnancy and a nurse did sit with B for a long time reassuring him that this wasn’t depression or body dysphoria. I believe that, A has constantly been showing off the bump, doesn’t mind photos of her being taken, and she's talked for months about the baby being a blessing, how much she loves it, what she will do once they are here etc. None of us had any clue this was a concern for him/them.

When we brought up the surrogacy comment B said he thinks that’s due to when he was worrying about her mental health towards the pregnancy he apologised for what she was going through and asked her if she regrets getting pregnant and if they should have considered other options like surrogacy, she responded no because she wanted to carry her babies and it would cost to much. But after that and the doctors visits she would reference surrogacy a lot and point out it would of cost him a lot more if they had. In the last 2ish months this has become a topic at least once a week and comments are made almost daily with the value going from around £5k to now £50k+. B does really well for himself but even to him this is a lot of money. He even suggested/offered she should start writing down everything she feels she's missing out on (like seafood) during and he will make sure she gets to do it all within the first 9months, she responded she was going to do it all anyway so it didn't count.

This is the first time since we found out A was pregnant that I’ve seen him sad/stressed over it.

The other thing was he didn't know we weren't aware of this. He said it's the reason he brought it up at lunch to see if we actually agreed but because we (I and D) just reacted excited and made suggestion albeit cheaper ones he thought we were encouraging it because we already knew and agreed with A's expectations.

B left after an hour or so and we started crafting and trying to enjoy the evening but the mood was low. Around 9:30 there was a message on the group chat from D saying shall we have a group call, It started awkward but D said that A wanted to talk a bit more because she doesn’t feel she communicated herself every well earlier. We listened, but really her “concise” reasoning was even worse than before.

She 100% feels that she is owed somewhere in the area between 45-50k. She was adamant that's how much surrogacy costs and therefore how much a pregnancy is worth. We gently asked questions regarding how she felt about the pregnancy etc and she said she is loving being pregnant and would do it again “especially if she can get compensation out of it” she even repeatedly said she’d accept the money if B just transferred it into HER account but she feels the gift needs to be given, its not a case that she has access to almost all the their finances. C was not talking a lot during this and I could tell she was finding this all difficult but at one point when A was just repeating herself using different words C did speak up and say that being pregnant is not about how much money you could get out of the experience but about carrying and loving your baby. A said she knows that but if she said she wanted to use a surrogate B wouldn’t have batted an eyelid so if he would have spent the money on that then why not give it to her for doing the same thing. C tried to speak about how she felt during her pregnancies and how it honestly won’t matter once the baby is here but did she want to spend her last few months while pregnant being pissed off and annoyed feeling she’s owed something for what should be the best time of her life. A was clearly annoyed by this but had nothing to say so, in my opinion, she got nasty, she said to C that she didn’t seem to mind when B gave her money after her last pregnancy. (context, A&B offered to cover the funeral expenses to bury C’s stillborn. They didn’t in the end but a fundraiser was set up to a charity and B did donate £1000 to that) C said nothing but got up and left the room. I exploded. I told A how selfish and greedy she was, I pointed out everything B had done before and during the pregnancy, how much the nursery and baby shower and new wardrobe had cost him, how she chose to get pregnant that no one made her and finally I said that if she wasn’t so stupid and greedy she’d know you can’t actually pay anyone to carry your child in the UK so all the surrogate would get is expenses and B has already paid for all of that and more! She argued back that I was wrong and the average cost is 50K and started repeating the earlier points so I cut in shouting that if she was a surrogate then the baby wouldn’t be hers so she may as well sign over all the parental rights to B because at this rate he’s the only genuine parent and she’s just a b\*tch looking for a payout. A started screaming down the phone but C’s husband had come into the room I was in and just gestured to cut the call. I did and went to C then all sat and just discussed the complete madness. None of us can rationalise it.

My phone started blowing up. A was texting me directly in all caps a sentence at a time. i saw ""how f\*cking dare you"" and some insults but I muted my phone and when I did look later she had deleted almost all of them and those left had been edited, I do wonder if D had done that but haven't asked. I kind of wish I had screenshot them as they came through. It was the same on the group chat. The last message was that we were intentionally not understanding her point of view, she is pregnant and emotional, and we should all respect each other. C had one message that had been deleted and about 40mins later a single ""sorry"". D had messaged C straight away apologising for the call and stating A had been out of line. She also text me saying that she could understand why I lost it but she now had a hysterical pregnant lady who thinks her baby will be taken away and I should have just hung up when I knew I was going to go of on off. Even C thinks that was a little harsh to point out she's not acting like a mother.

When I explained the whole thing to my poor fella who picked me up tearful and after almost an entire bottle of wine he said I was completely right and that B should genuinely consider leaving and taking full custody. He is viciously loyal however and was probably saying that to support me. He finds A a bit difficult at times anyway and loves C and her family to pieces.

I accept I was an AH, I also think A was and is as long as she keeps this entitlement up.

I do not want to hear criticism of B, C or D. Honestly, they did nothing wrong.

my actual AITA question is was I the AH for telling my friend if she considers herself a surrogate, and needs to be compensated for carrying her child, she should sign over all parental responsibilities to the father?

other question, wtf do we all do now because this is insane and the biggest blow up we have ever had and I at the moment cannot see a way back?",1,1754521631.0,AITAH,22,0.56,False

Goal was to go all in with this one, have done OMAD for months at a time before so not entirely new, but first water fast. Was planning on 14 days but if I bailed after 7 wouldn’t be too disappointed in myself. 

Last meal was Sunday evening so currently sitting at just over 84 hours without food intake. I’m feeling slow, mildly lightheaded… no boost yet. Not sure if I screwed myself over with what I’ve been consuming and that’s why?

Monday (first day) I had a black coffee in the morning, a NoDoz tablet and an LMNT flavoured sachet during the day with water. Black tea in the evening. 

Tuesday had a black coffee, LMNT sachet and another black tea in the evening. 

Wednesday 2x black coffees, NoDoz tablet and another LMNT. My unflavoured electrolyte powder arrived in the mail so have switched to that. 

It’s now Thursday morning. I’ve just seen on the NoDoz box that it “contains sugars”. 
Would the combination of the coffees, the two NoDoz and the LMNT have enough calories to break the fast so really I’ve just been sitting here hungry with no benefits?",1,1754521582.0,fasting,8,1.0,False
